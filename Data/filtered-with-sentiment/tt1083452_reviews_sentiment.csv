" Perfect Sunday afternoon feel good film.
",0.765,0.9873,2021-02-28 00:00:00,8,"Despite knowing the film's outcome, I found myself fully rooted and invested in Eddie's story every step of the way. I had moments on the edge of my chair shouting, ""come on, Eddie"", moments of sadness, but also moments where I was full of cheer and joy. Such a heartwarming story about always finding a way to compleating your dreams. Though also one about how it's taking the part that counts as cliche as it sounds.Eddie, played by Taron Egerton, was a superb actor and choice for this role. They couldn't have picked anyone better for this role, and I feel the same with Hugh Jackman. An unlikely pair that I want to see more of in the future in other projects as well as more work of them both individually. I would defiantly watch this film again."

" Eddie the Penguin
",0.0,0.9544,2021-01-02 00:00:00,6,"There's a real good chance that, without ever seeing the first scene in this film, you've seen this movie before. It is a super generic, underdog sports movie that follows the beats note for note without deviation. Edgerton is good here, which gives this a bump but aside from that really this was nothing all that special. I've just seen it too many times at this point to really find it particularly memorable. Yes, the ending is emotional but that's every semi-successful underdog movie really.End of the day, you could do much worse if you're looking for a reason to root for the little guy but you could also find better. It's not a bad movie, and if it happened to be on somewhere I wouldn't tell anyone to turn it off, but I also can't say I'd advise anyone to ever seek it out.P.S. A quick Wikipedia check on the true story and the years that followed added a sort've sad clown, sour note to this whole thing. The lead character is portrayed as a bit of a goofball, odd duck joke in the Olympiad circles and evidently that's not too far off given that the real deal only ever managed to qualify the one time before having rules put in place ostensibly telling him he wasn't good enough. He never competed again, never really triumphed beyond this one time, in which he placed dead last and his ""victory"" was basically a participation trophy. So while it may seem like a good story for a movie, the full story is a little less optimistic and cheerful, at least so it seems. Kinda brings the movie down a touch for me, even though it really shouldn't."
" A funny, heartwarming film.
",0.7184,0.9741,2020-12-27 00:00:00,10,"This is a brilliantly warm, funny, touching, film. The actors are great and portray the characters in a believable way. Soundtrack is great and really fits well with the film. Watch this anytime you want to feel happy!"

",-0.4767,0.9873,2020-12-21 00:00:00,9,"Late to the game, we just watched this for the first time last night on Disney+. I don't know how or WHY we missed it when it came out almost 5 years ago! I knew nothing of this story and had no expectations. Wow, so surprised at how good it was. First of all Hugh Jackman, who knew?! He did a great job at his part and with no hint of his Aussie accent. Good character and back story. He and Eddie played so well opposite each other throughout. Another special surprise for me was Christopher Walken. Love him and while his part was small, it was MIGHTY! I laughed at good comedic moments, held my breath and covered my eyes at the uncertainty and thrills of the sport, and cried with emotions towards the end. Fabulous feel-good family film. Add it to your must see list."

" Heartwarming When it Counts
",0.4767,0.9759,2020-11-02 00:00:00,6,"Eddie the Eagle is directed by Dexter Fletcher and stars Taron Egerton and Hugh Jackman, this film chronicles the life of Eddie, an un-athletic outcast and his journey to making it to the Olympics. So I had high hopes for Eddie the Eagle as it was produced by Matthew Vaughn and starred Taron Egerton who was great in last years, Kingsman: The Secret Service, however this movie didn't live up to my expectations. First off the movie suffers from huge tonal shifts, one moment it takes place in the ""real world"" and the next it becomes a cartoon without any explanations. The acting for the most part wasn't bad, I thought Hugh Jackman was good as come to expect but the real wildcard was Taron Egerton who I found his acting to be laughable at times. I'm not sure if the real Eddie acted the way he did but sometimes I found Taron's acting extremely forced, so without any background information I'm not sure whether Taron did an excellent portrayal of Eddie or incredibly poor. Also the comedy itself did't always land, as well the lack of tone going back to it again, sometimes the film would come of as family film, then the next a character would describe sex very crudely in a jokingly matter leaving myself as the audience wondering exactly what the hell is going on. A few things that this film does have going for it, is pretty good pacing as well as a great third act that just made me feel good. And thats the thing, Eddie the Eagle posses one of the best third acts in a film as it really changed my outlook on this movie, it just elevated this film as a whole with a greatly executed climax that really made me feel all warm inside. It felt like a totally different movie when the Olympic games started, the film stopped featuring cartoonist scenes as well as halted hitting the audience over the head of motifs that were so predictable. At the end of the day this isn't a horrible film, it just could have used another draft to fix up problems this film was plagued with, overall this is a film I doubt I'll watch again however I would recommend it solely for its third act and with that being said Eddie the Eagle gets a 6/10."
" It was enjoyable from start to finish
",0.4404,0.823,2020-07-29 00:00:00,9,"I had a wonderful time watching this movie. It made me laugh, smile and feel the grind and determination that Eddie had to feel to pull it off. My girlfriend even cried a little at the end because she felt to happy for Eddie.Honestly I can't say much more than that without going into great detail but It is a wonderful ""feel-good"" movie of one man's determination to do something he dreamed of his entire life.Only negative thing I can say isn't about the story, it's about the setting. When they go to Calgary and to the ski jumping hill... That isn't Calgary, not even close. being from Alberta I've been to the Olympic park on a couple occasions. Calgary is located in the middle of the badlands great prairies, and the park is built on the side of a river valley, about 150 kms from anything remotely resembling a mountain. It's a small thing but it bothered me a lot, when they portray my home as basically a mountainous paradise when it is far from it."
" A feel-good movie in the best sense.
",0.6369,0.8893,2020-07-27 00:00:00,7,"Taron Egerton is wonderfully awkward in this crowd-pleaser the likes of which don't seem to get made very often nowadays, at least not this succesfully.It's a nice little throwback to feel-good sport dramas like Rudy and especially Cool Runnings. Devoid of any cynisism and concerned only with leaving the audience cheering for the underdog.
It's full of clichés, but also full of heart and positivity."

" Simply genius
",0.0,0.9954,2020-05-10 00:00:00,9,"I don't even know where to start.
1) Dexter Fletcher has been one of my favourite directors lately. Just his attention for detail is remarkable, not just in this movie obviously. Dexter and Taron seem to be very good together. (You have to watch Rocketman)
2) Taron Egerton's acting skills are just great. The way he handled the character of Eddie is perfect. He perfectly portrayed his personality, determination and courage.
3) Hugh Jackman aka Bronson Peary as a fictional character, he handled it very well and turned out as an interesting, funny and very important character in the film.
4) The character of Eddie is just so nice and enjoyable that it's impossible not to like him. The way he always drinks his milk is just so adorable. He's a very inspiring and interesting person and I admire him as a person.P. S. : I realise that the movie is only inspired by the true story."

",0.0,0.9913,2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"This is the most inspiring film this year! It was also perfectly casted! (Seriously, look up the real Eddie ""The Eagle"" Edwards and compare to the movie. The resemblance is uncanny. It's like looking in a mirror.) Ok, well it's almost perfectly casted. As much as I like Hugh Jackman (Seriously, I'll watch Hugh Jackman in anything. If you want me to watch a movie just tell me Hugh Jackman's in it and I'm sold.) I feel like I've seen his character before. (The jerk with a heart of gold.) I've seen it in Real Steel, and it felt like watching his character in Real Steel. That being said, the movie is very uplifting! I'm not a huge fan of sports movies, and I'll admit I was skeptical about this movie, but surprisingly, I really enjoyed it! It doesn't have any of the typical sports movie cliches like the slow clap. (Which I HATE. I HATE the slow clap. It's so silly and overdone.) It does have the training montage cliche, but at least here it's humorous. That brings up another point. This movie had a lot more comedy than I thought it would. I didn't leave the theater thinking ""This film was a comedy,"" but it had enough comedic bits to keep me interested. Not knowing anything about Eddie or the Olympics or any of the subject matter of the film, I'm surprised I enjoyed this as much as I did. I'm not a big fan of sports movies, and I'm certainly not going to add a bunch of sports movies to my Netflix queue just because I enjoyed this movie, but for what it was, I highly recommend it.Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"

",0.4767,0.9785,2019-03-12 00:00:00,8,"Continuing my plan to watch every Hugh Jackman movie in order, I come to Eddie The Eagle (2015)Plot In A Paragraph: The story of Eddie Edwards (an enthusiastic Taron Egerton) the notoriously tenacious British underdog ski jumper who charmed the world at the 1988 Winter Olympics.This was my first time watching this, and i absolutely adored this movie. Filled with good performances, especially from Taron Egerton, a lot of heart, a few laughs and a fun 80's soundtrack all make for a good time.I watched it with my 13 year old son, and he enjoyed it too, so you don't have to know anything about Eddie The Eagle to enjoy it, as he had never heard about him.Following on from the misfires Chaplie and Pan, Eddie The Eagle is Jackman's third under performer in a row. Eddie The Eagle grossed just $15 million (on a $23 million budget) at the domestic box office, and did not place on the 100 highest grossing movies list of the year."

As a 90's kid I never actually knew the story of Eddie the Eagle, but definitely knew about the Jamaican Bobsled team and their heroic story. I can honestly say now though that I wish I would have been introduced to this story a long time ago as well.What an incredible story and it was surprisingly told in a fresh an entertaining way. Ignoring the fact that the real Eddie didn't have a Hugh Jackman there to help him, it's almost disappointing, that storyline was actually quite heartfelt and interesting.I found the movie to be fun, entertaining, and inspiring.Will absolutely watch again, can't wait."

He perfectly knows that he will never be a champion, but this is not his aim, so at the end his strong and funny personality gets the favour of the audience.

Based on a true story, this film is suspenseful, dramatic and hilarious all in one, resulting in an insanely entertaining feature. Taron Egerton is brilliant as hero Eddie Edwards. He conveys emotion so well that you feel every feeling, every failure and every triumph. He is perfect as the nerd, likable hero and champion. Hugh Jackman is perfectly cast as a has-been champion who unwillingly becomes Eddie's coach. His 'Bo Derek' scene is fabulously hilarious and brilliantly acted."

" It's bad enough, when you aren't good enough,....
",-0.7101,0.9269,2018-05-26 00:00:00,9,"First, Taron Egerton deserves an award for the three facial expressions of the real Eddy. The smile, happy. The upside down smile, it hasn't beaten me yet. And the I have to try harder, I am serious, every-man look.It's bad enough, when you aren't good enough, but, when everyone tells you the unvarnished truth, you could get a little down. Or, you could set out to meet and beat every obstacle in you path. Then take a look back and smile. Face forward and say with conviction, ""I am the squad.""This movie is a family show, start to finish. Age 10 to 18 would go for this movie. So, if know a normal kid, they would get a few laughs, for sure. There might be a few swear words, but so few I don't remember them. Nobody dies. There is no shooting, nor car crashes. This movie reflects most peoples day to day lives, at least those of us that don't do the Olympics.If there were ever a parody of this film, not that it needs one, it would have to be by The Trailer Park Boys. Yeah, Bubbles."
" Okay so it's cheesy...

Both Egerton and Jackman look like they're having a blast and the simple fact that you can't help but root for Eddie in every scene is testament to this films success. This isn't a biopic, but there's enough truth here to show the fella for the hero he is, a real inspiration, Edwards should be remembered as such. Not sure this is the traditional summary that most Olympians would want, but Eddie isn't most Olympians. He was a bit daft, just like this film, but blimey if it doesn't make you smile, massive euphoric fist pumping smiles!!"
" Awful, anachranistic mockery. Poor!
",-0.8268,-0.7788,2018-05-13 00:00:00,2,"The sets are all out time and place, as someone who the 80's first hand I know the sets are very unrealisitic. Clearly someone who was not around at the time and/or has no grasp, knowledge or understanding of the historical element, which is really sad. (TWO TRIBES BY FRANKIE WAS NOT 1986) The you guy who plays Eddie , at presumably 15 yrs (we are not told his age) took his acting and twitches from the character Liam in the Benidorm ITV series. Alas Liam plays his part for comic slapstick laughs, this kid is painfully laughable - in a BAD way. Keith Allen is his usual thesbian self, hammy acting is fine in the theatre but it does not transfer well to film. I imagine that this ridiculously hogh score for this film (7/10) is from folks who weren't around at the time and see the eighties as slapstick, comic and only good to laugh at and take pity on. A very sad film. This review is no reflection on Eddie the Eagle who was not a man to poke fun at (though he was happy to downplay himself) he was a man who represented Britsh fortitude to fight against the odds and do his best, win or lose. To mock him and the era is a pathetic way to exploit the past. 2/10 POOR."

",0.0,0.9956,2018-04-30 00:00:00,7,"What a climax. Magnificent feel good movie and hilariously funny on top of that. What a great underdog story. This movie is based on a true story of an olympian underdog ski jumper. I still can remember this dude when I saw him live on tv during the olympics back in the eighties. But I never knew that as a kid eddie had a severe injury to his legs. The story of him as a kid wanting to be an olympian medal winner is just cute, as would be with any kid. But when the boy got mature this dude still wanted to be an olympic competitor when he was still rubbish at sports and had literally NO help for training at all.Started watching this movie based on the upbeat hilarious trailer. The movie itself is somewhat slower and more seriously and the lead character eddie doesnt really sparkle as an actor, but he sure has charisma and will power, although he is the utlimate dork. It is truly a heartwarming story, with a super feel good climax. Christopher Walken plays a very short supporting role but is the most powerful actor in the whole picture. What a joy to watch. I Feel Good ! Go Eddie Go !"

" Loved It ...
",0.5994,0.9809,2018-04-11 00:00:00,8,"As a movie, it was so thrilling and engaging. I loved it... Hugh Jackman is one of my favorite actors in Hollywood and he didn't disappoint me in this flick also. Taron Eagorton gave us a promising performance as Eddie the Eagle. The 1:45 hrs 
was worthy and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My small advice to those who haven't seen this movie is, ""don't check more on Eddie in internet or elsewhere...just watch the movie and forget this was a biopic..."" and that will definitely help."
" Outstanding docu-film!
",0.6476,0.9661,2018-02-17 00:00:00,9,"They don't get any better than this! This docu-film was as close to perfect as they come. Taron Egerton nailed his character as did Hugh Jackman and for that matter, the entire cast. The whole production - from directing, cinematography, writing, editing and even the score were all on point. A fun, inspirational, heartwarming and entertaining film for all ages, and a great tribute to Eddie ""The Eagle"" Edwards. A well deserved 9/10 from me."
" Inspirational Movie
",0.5106,0.9493,2018-01-01 00:00:00,9,"This movie tells a story, never give in, don't listen to those doubt you. Based on the true story of Eddie the Eagle a seemingly ordinary person who had a dream and would not listen to those that wanted to doubt him. It is a truly inspirational tale and is well made with some truly great acting performances. 
 I highly recommend this movie and defy anyone not to shed a tear at the emotional ending.As is said during the film in life as in the olympics its not necessarily about being the winner but being willing to take a chance to achieve your dreams in life."
" Biopic about a ski jumper
",0.0,0.9724,2017-10-04 00:00:00,7,"""Eddie the Eagle"" is a delightful film, based on the true story of Eddie Edwards, a British skier who became the first competitor since 1929 to represent Great Britain in the 1988 Olympics. These biopics follow a formula - the underdog, adversity, the gruff coach with a heart of gold, more adversity, and finally, triumph. This biopic is no different. In the film, Eddie has spent a year in the hospital because of bad knees and wears a brace, which is removed in childhood. Despite this problem, Eddie wants to be in the Olympics. He tries hurdle-jumping and, failing that, decides on speed skiing. He is on a team that is successful locally, but when it comes time to choose skiers for the Olympics, he is not chosen. Undaunted, he decides on ski jumping and sets off for Garmisch, Germany, to train on the course there. He is self-funded, has no coach and emerges a bloody, fractured mess. Eddie is finally taken on by an ex-ski jumper, the hard-drinking Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman). The British Olympic committee is not impressed with Eddie, and in fact, changes the qualifications for skiing so that he does not qualify. But Eddie isn't about to give up. When he finally qualifies, he's warned by Peary that if he loses, he won't be allowed another chance, and he will not be taken seriously. He wants Eddie to wait until the 1992 Olympics, but Eddie feels this is his moment.This is an uplifting, inspirational film about never giving up on your dreams. Though we've seen it many times, it's always good to be reminded. Taron Egerton is wonderful as Eddie, who wears thick glasses, puts up with hazing and insults, and stays the course. Hugh Jackman provides some good star power, and as Eddie's mum, Jo Hartley is marvelous. The acting throughout is good, though most of the other characters are stereotypes.It's hard to say how much dramatic license was taken with this movie - Eddie's bio makes no reference of hospitalization and bad knees as a child, though at the end of the film, there are photos of the real Eddie, and in one, he appears to be on crutches. He was self-funded and he wasn't upper class, which also works against him, and these are brought up in the film.There is some beautiful ski jumping shown as well.A good story told with warmth and humor about a man who today, known as Eddie the Eagle, remains a British celebrity."
" Watch the Movie not the Trailer
",0.0,0.9102,2017-09-23 00:00:00,10,The trailer was all right but did not leave me with the feeling I would enjoy this movie. But I was bored so I watched it anyway. Quickly I wasn't so bored anymore. This movie was terrific. Isn't it amazing how the best stories are true. You don't make this up. So I suggest getting a glass of milk. Sitting the kids in front of the TV and watching this movie. Just don't jump off the roof after. Your not an eagle.
" Insightful
",0.0,0.9762,2017-07-12 00:00:00,7,"I remember Eddie the Eagle as a joke, a laughing stock, incessantly pilloried by the gutter press and sneered-at by the mainstream media alike. This film made me realise just how wrong I was.Those shots peering down from the top of the ramp at the tiny people in the distance barely hint at the terror, standing up there and knowing that when you set off, there is only one way down. They don't so much fall, as plummet.I enjoyed the humour and the music, but most of all the story ... just ... worked. I know it's dramatised, it's not a documentary. Doesn't matter. It was something unique, truly special. And the film captures the essence of Eddie's '15 minutes of fame' in a remarkably positive and upbeat way. A true Olympian."
" The Story of a Stubborn and Reckless Man
",-0.6597,0.8302,2017-07-02 00:00:00,7,"The clumsy Michael ""Eddie"" Edwards (Taron Egerton) has dreamed on participating in the Olympics Games since he was a boy. Eddie is not accepted by the British committee in skiing but not aware of his limits, he decides to dispute the dangerous ski-jumping sport. He befriends the former notorious alcoholic jumper Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) that helps him giving some instructions how to jump. Eddie succeeds to go to the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics but is rejected by everybody. When he decides to participate in the 90-meter jump, Bronson travels to Calgary to support him. What will happen to Eddie, The Eagle?""Eddie The Eagle"" is a film based on true events of a reckless and stubborn man that has decided to go to the Olympics since he was a boy. The screenplay shows a charismatic young man, but the main character has visibly psychological problems. Once he did not die in his stupid decision, he may have been worshiped and the writer decided to show him maybe as an example of determination and not stubbornness and irresponsibleness. But the feel-good film is highly entertaining and worthwhile watching. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Voando Alto"" (""Flying High"")"
" Goofy and Charming
",0.5859,0.9692,2017-06-29 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)I still remember Eddie the Eagle from the 1988 Olympics. The soaring ski jumper who was notable for basically finishing last place while full of spirit and glee as he was so happy to be competing. This is the story of him and his endless drive against all odds. The film starts out rather silly as they try to illuminate Eddie as a child and his passion for competing at the Olympics. He failed over and over and over again at different events but made an effort as the only British Ski Jumper. The film is very funny, told very smartly and you just have to root for this quirky fellow. This is a true fell-good movie. Even better because I remember watching him with my Dad on TV."
" Awesome film!
",0.6588,0.9884,2017-05-30 00:00:00,10,"This film offers fresh new cool material, I have watched it a few times Taron Egerton does a great job bringing the character to life I did not know who he was before I watched this film. The whole cast is great they did a good job in carefully picking the right actors and also the writers did a great job the movie director.The only downside of this movie is that there will not be a sequel, I would have loved to see more of the Eddie the Eagle character he is so likable and down to earth, I think he connects with the audience.Overall I highly recommend seeing this film is definitively worth it. The music in it was great as well, it was nice to see this movie specially because it is based on a real life story. Thumbs up for Eddie the Eagle!"
" Fly Sk(i) High.
",0.0,0.9851,2017-05-29 00:00:00,8,"I didn't think, nor did I expect that this movie would be an 8/10. I could feel the adrenaline, anxiety and absolute awe, streamlining throughout my entire body as Eddie made his ascendance to the 90M mark. Misty-eyed as Eddie made his number one supporter, his favorite cheerleader and the first lady of his life prouder than words could contain, and proving his father right, not wrong, because he always believed in his son, behind the fear and macho persona, Eddie's father, hoped for the best, for his son.""I'm not deluded. I know there are plenty of other athletes more deserving in publicity than me.I would like to apologize if my silly antics have cast a shadow over their achievements"". Such a moment of growth, maturity and understanding makes you vouch for him more.Eddie and Peary's disagreement was equally understandable. Eddie showed Peary what his worth was, and Peary wanted the chance to show it back to Eddie, but, at the same time, Eddie has spent his entire life for this moment. His goal was never to win, his goal was to achieve, and he did.This movie is not about being the winner, it's about winning. Not about the triumph, but the struggle. Not about success, but rather, not quitting.I don't know about Eddie as a person himself, but, this movie painted his story in the most uplifting of ways. Taron Egerton was more than sufficient for this role, and though there were points I felt he could've really done better, there were also quite a few other moments where, he just did it right, with some excellent help from Dexter Fletcher and Matthew Margeson.A story of determination, belief, hope, support and introspection, Eddie the Eagle took the ""y"" out of Sky and replaced it with himself, ""i"", so he could fly ski high."
" The Ultimate in ""Feel Good"" Movies; Overwhelmingly Optimistic and Inspiring
",0.7579,0.9944,2017-05-21 00:00:00,7,"EDDIE THE EAGLE is fine. The story is fine. The performances are fine. It's all fine. It's one of those movies that are so inoffensive, so moderate in every aspect, that you'll no doubt find it enjoyable enough without feeling blown away when it's done. It's a biographical film about the Olympic dreams of Eddie Edwards (Taron Egerton) from director Dexter Fletcher. The movie opens with young Edwards practicing anything and everything that might lead to his eventual acceptance into the games and, when he's eventually denied membership on Britain's downhill skiing team, he decides to become the nation's first Olympic ski jumper to have competed in the event since the early twentieth century. Unfortunately, Edwards just isn't very good at it. He's repeatedly reminded that most ski jumpers begin training at the age of six, so his impatient persistence is more likely to lead to his bone-shattering death on the slope than Olympic glory. Egerton shines as Edwards, a vast turn from his breakout role as suave super spy-in-training Eggsy in KINGSMEN. Edwards is the epitome of awkwardness. What he lacks in skill, coordination, and common sense, he makes up for in determination; he tackles any challenge head-on with an aloof smile. He quickly realizes he's going to need some help if he plans on making it to Calgary in '88, so it's a stroke of luck that the alcoholic who maintains the training grounds in Germany happens to be Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman), former American ski jumping champion.Peary isn't so keen on Edwards' chances. He does his best to warn him against what essentially amounts to suicide, but reluctantly agrees to train him when he realizes Edwards has no intention of walking away. Jackman is his usual charismatic self here. It's hard to hate the man, and his gruff alcoholic ski jumper is just a few claws and a blood lust away from being Wolverine from any Bryan Singer X-MEN film. Egerton and Jackman have great chemistry, so it makes it easier to swallow when the rest of the film settles for mediocrity. Here lies my biggest complaint with EDDIE THE EAGLE: it's nothing you haven't seen done before a hundred times in any generic biopic. An underdog aspires to greatness in whatever field; he finds a hesitant mentor who takes them under their wing; training montages galore; and it all leads up to the big game/match/competition when our hero finds glory and everyone goes home happy. This is EDDIE THE EAGLE in a nutshell. There is nothing here you won't see coming from a mile away, even if you're, as I was, totally unfamiliar with the real life source material. The director, Fletcher, doesn't really take any chances or try anything extraordinary with the material; he just lets the characters and ski jumping action speak for themselves. But it worked well enough to entertain me. As mentioned, Egerton and Jackman are a fun pairing, and the ski jumping scenes were more exciting than I had anticipated.As I've found with previous movies on subjects I couldn't care less about (e.g. hockey in GOON, Formula-1 car racing in RUSH, etc.), I'm drawn deeper into the film from the glimpse into something I'd never cared to explore. Sure I've seen ski jumping on TV but I hadn't realized how brutal (or potentially life- ending) it can be. We're treated to a few spills, including one where a man lands so hard it's presumed he wouldn't walk again, so it builds the tension a bit before the movie's incorrigible peppiness erases any suspense with its super-saccharine vibe. This movie is just sohappy. I guess it's supposed to be a reflection of Edwards' own attitude toward the whole thing. No matter how bleak the future or how terrifying the potential consequences, the movie forces you to face it with a gleeful smile thanks to Edwards' never-ceasing optimism (and some help from the movie's perky, 80's synth soundtrack). You never doubt that Edwards will find his Olympic glory (otherwise I doubt there'd be much of a movie and, if there were, it wouldn't be so punishingly cheerful) but I'm glad in that it didn't come to pass as I'd expected. In what was the only instance in which the movie zigged when I expected it to zag, the finale in Calgary doesn't go as I expected. Again, probably because I had no idea who Eddie ""the Eagle"" Edwards was before sitting down for this film. Winter Olympics enthusiasts won't have that luxury, I suppose, as they know where it's going.It's hard to dislike EDDIE THE EAGLE. It does its best to prevent you from it. It's infectious. There's nothing here that really stands out but it's an entertaining 100 minutes or so. I wouldn't recommend you go out of your way for it but if you're clicking through cable TV on a lazy afternoon and you happen to find it, I doubt it'll let you down."
" A feel great biopic
",0.6249,0.9906,2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,"Wow. Just wow. I can not believe that a movie about ski jumping could be that entertaining. Hugh Jackman is pretty much a fun loving Wolverine in this and he is having all kinds of fun. Before becoming an actor Hugh Jackman was a gym teacher, maybe that's why he is more animated than usual. Anyway, the guy from Kingsman's Secret Service is in this, Taron Egerton and he does an outstanding job. Pretty much proving himself not to be a one hit wonder. Anyway, the film is based of the true story of an underdog who has to work for it and his coach who a natural talent who didn't work for it and burned out early. This isn't just a feel good film, it has tons of layers and laughs. This film is one of those rare film you walk away a different person after watching it. I almost feel like watching it again and I literally just watched it last night, it is that good."

Because of my age i'm not familiar with the story of Eddie the Eagle, but i'm glad that they went with the more entertaining, exaggerated version of the real life events. You fall for the main character and his dream to participate in Olympic games within the first few seconds of the movie.Yes, everything is kind of shown in a nostalgic and overoptimistic view, but this leads to the lovely feel-good vibe of the movie. This is not a movie you have to see in cinemas. Although, it is perfect for a family afternoon in your living room. You can feel that everyone involved had a blast and enjoyed every second of making this movie.A small but delightful movie with good messages and morals."

We see our hero fulfill his dream of competing at the Calgary Winter Olympics. And here is the problem the films virtually mirror each other when in reality the Eddie Edwards story is a fascinating one and did not need this Hollywood makeover He was not the hapless bafone the film portrays him, he was an accomplished skier and an intelligent man who went on to complete a law degree in later life.

It has its moments yes, but I couldn't stop myself from thinking that this all had been done so much better in other 'underdog' films. I think even the James Corden 'Paul Potts' film was better than this.The best thing about this film is Hugh Jackman, whose charm carries the scenes he's in. Ultimately though this film remained a bronze medal outing for me rather than a golden one."

Eddie The Eagle ticks all these boxes with ease providing 90 minutes or so of unadulterated fun. The film is based on true events with smutterings of fiction added to the edges.The 1988 Winter Olympic Games in Calgary is the location. The male ski-jumping event the sport with Eddie Edwards (Taron Egerton) as the semi-comedy contestant. Director Dexter Fletcher brought similar smutterings of comedy with his 2013 film Sunshine on Leith.Christopher Walken and Hugh Jackman provide some A list casting but Egerton is made to look extremely realistic to the real life Eddie Edwards.Walken in a brief role as an ex ski jumping coach looks ill at ease descending to the Michael Caine level of film role.

" First or last, your still a winner!
",0.6239,0.9945,2017-01-13 00:00:00,8,"What I would describe as a feel good film, a one for all the family irrespective of age or background. Eddie the Eagle is a true story of seer grit and determination and portrays the kind of attitude many people lack in this 21st century.The story starts in young Eddies neighbourhood where we quickly learn that he has a dream of going to the Olympics and is prepared to make huge sacrifices in order to achieve this goal. This vision is said to have started while reading a book on the summer Olympics but after a spell of bad luck and poor choices Eddie struggles to find the sport that is right for him. It's during these early stages of the film where you either decide if you are going to see the film out or call it quits. Having been disappointed by the family's acting from the beginning as I felt they lacked true emotion, I was somehow transfixed into wanting to see where this story was going.I watched on and am so pleased I did. The film was written very well and Taron Edgerton played a very believable Eddie. Although with films there is always going to be some bending of the true events, I felt that the story did a fantastic job of portraying Eddies journey to the Olympics.There is a lot of comedy in this film and I believe it helps add to our love towards Eddie, we want him to succeed regardless of the result. Although he doesn't come first, he does gain a victory in himself. The real message of the film is that regardless of being an underdog if you want something enough and are prepared to put in the hours of training and preparation then you are more than capable of achieving it.If your feeling down or need some motivation, then give this one a go."
