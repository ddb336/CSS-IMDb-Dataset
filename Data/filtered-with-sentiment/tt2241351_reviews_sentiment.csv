" Manhattan thriller
",0.1027,0.9485,2020-11-26 00:00:00,6,"The presence of Julia Roberts and George Clooney in the cast was a good enough reason to choose to see 'Money Monster' (made in 2016) and the name of Jodie Foster as director was another reason. Foster is already at her fourth feature film and proves here that she has a good grasp of the tools of film making. 'Money Monster' is a thriller set in the worlds of the big television studios and of the stock exchange investors, both located in midtown Manhattan, professionally made, which will satisfy fans of the genre. My feeling of slight disappointment is caused by the fact that from a collection of talents as this film gathers, viewers have, I think, the right to expect something special. This is not the case, but one does not exit empty hands from watching this movie either.The story. Lee Gates (George Clooney) and Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts) are the anchor, respectively the producer of a television show of the kind we love to hate - a show providing economic advice including tips for stock market investments in a media circus style, in other words entertainment on the viewers' money . The studio is infiltrated a young man (Jack O'Connell) disguised as a pizza delivery boy, who takes the anchor hostage on live broadcast, demanding explanations and compensation (tens of millions of dollars!) for the losses due to a spectacular fall of shares of a company recommended by the show the previous day. The official explanation is that that the cause been a financial software 'glitch', but we will soon find out that something else entirely has happened - a high-level scam and fraud, the victims being the small investors, among others the ones who follow the recommendations of television shows.As an action thriller throwing critical and satirical arrows at commercial television and the world of computer finance 'Money Monster' works quite well. The feeling I had watching the movie was that I was watching a double episode (due to the screening time) of a good TV series. The actors are doing their job well, but the question is whether Clooney and Roberts' (paychecks) level acting were needed for these roles. They fail to add anything special to their characters, and the feeling of overcasting cannot be avoided. The kidnapping and hostage situation that takes place in television studios and then on the streets of Manhattan are truthfully rendered. Probably we, the spectators, are to blame, if we expected more than the level of 'OK movie' from a production with such names in the credits. Jodie Foster is an actress who has added drama and vibration to her roles in films such as 'Taxi Driver', 'The Accused', 'The Silence of the Lambs' or 'Panic Room'. However, as a director, her work until now is too routine. More boldness as well as avoiding and overcoming the beaten paths would have added a lot to this film. It's not too late for future work."
" 30-minute mystery stretched over 100
",0.0,0.6249,2020-11-12 00:00:00,4,"There are 5-minutes of great acting from George Clooney at the start of the hostages situation. After that, it devolves into a very goofey, unrealistic show."
" Sunday Afternoon Type-of Movie
",0.0,0.1615,2020-11-03 00:00:00,5,"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is the latest young adult adaptation which is directed by Tim Burton and stars Asa Butterfield, Eva Green and Samuel L. Jackson. This film is about a boy named Jacob, who stumbles across a mystery that makes him travel through time to discover Miss Peregrine's home, which is housed to children that have special abilities. Now I'll be honest, I really wasn't looking too forward to this film, Tim Burton's last couple live action films haven't been very good and overall I haven't been a fan of the recent trend of young adult novel adaptations as a lot of those movies just feel cheap and rushed. However I really dug this film, at least for the first hour. The movie opens and it has a really slick editing style, with striking shots that gave me such an indie horror movie vibe, that I got the impression that I may be in for something special, but that mood fades once the protagonist arrives in Wales to discover Miss Peregrine. I'm not saying the movie got horrible after that but it was just a tonal shift from something that I was seriously digging. The rest of the movie focuses on Miss Peregrine and her peculiar children, and for the first 40 minutes it is quite interesting getting the introduction to all the characters and seeing their abilities are pretty cool. Unlike most young adult adaptations, Burton was able to create a movie that felt like it stuck to its dark material and didn't shy away from being scary, which is something I cant say for most movies from this genre. I'm not sure how much of the source material Burton stuck to but he brought forth his own weirdness to it that didn't feel like over-the-top Burton-ness. Though there are some things that due deserve praise in this film, it sadly has a lot of things weighing it down including a very weak and lifeless performance by Asa Butterfield who is normally very good in the roles he's played. However here, I don't know if he was directed to speak all his lines as if he doesn't care but he does. Also the last half of the film takes a turn for the worst by having a really stupid, over-exaggerated climax with skeletons straight out of Army of Darkness, luckily though Samuel L. Jackson is outstanding and really elevates the finally act. My only other real problem with the film is it doesn't explain itself thoroughly, and left me questioning the logic of some things brought up throughout. So this isn't a perfect movie but it's fun for what it's worth, and I'm sure many kids will get a kick out of the film, I just wish it would have maintained that tone at the beginning throughout. Overall I do recommend this film as it is better than most young adult adaptations, and I would like to see a sequel to this film only if it doesn't get as stupid as that third act did, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children gets a 5/10."
" Absolutely moronic premise, does nothing well.
",-0.701,0.4276,2020-09-26 00:00:00,4,"You'd think with these actors involved it would have to be half decent. It's a terrible movie that thinks it's a lot better than it is. You feel no empathy for any of the characters. Am I meant to feel sorry for some loser that lost his money on the stock market.
Don't waste your time on this there is much better available.
I hope Jodie foster has improved as a director since this movie,"

" Classic plot done on the cheap
",0.0,-0.9418,2020-08-19 00:00:00,6,"This movie follows a classic plot line, up to a point. The good guys know something bad has happened (in this case, an inexplicable computer glitch which caused a stock's price to plunge and in the process wipe out thousands of investors). While investigating, the ""good guys"" discover that a higher-up (who claimed he was as baffled as anyone by the ""glitch"") created it so he could secretly make enormous profits. Examples of this ""surprise villain"" plotline include ""LA Confidential,"" ""Eyes of Laura Mars,"" and ""Klute."" However, the film is disappointing in that its ""surprise"" villain is an unlikeable Wall Street ""genius"" whose role comes as no surprise to viewers (or to cast members) when he is revealed as the ultimate manipulator. It also has a sense of being done on the cheap, without much character background development provided for the leading personalities: TV finance guru (George Clooney), his TV producer (Julia Roberts), the villain's PR officer and apparent mistress (Caitriona Balfe), the half-crazed victim of the scam who brings things to a crisis by invading the TV studio (Jack O'Connell), and the bad guy himself (Dominic West). No lesson to be learned here about Wall Street manipulators -- other than to keep an eye on them. Traditional regulators certainly won't be doing that, at least not for the next four, maybe eight years."
" Not a shocker 5/10
",0.1139,-0.7057,2020-05-17 00:00:00,5,"George Clooney and Julia Roberts can prove that sometimes, their teaming up in movies doesn't help the film's success. The whole plot takes too long to move, and seems like the story is just ""stuck"" in one place and the only threat is a man with a loaded gun. That is not enough for a plot that has no threats or twists."
" Unbelivable touching movie

If, like me you object to both being used frequently and without any benefit to the actual plot of the film - being used for the sake of it, then The OFF Switch is the best possible option. in our home we got to about 15 minutes. Clearly the scriptwriter had a problem with knowing a ""wider"" Queens English. If thrillers have to be filled with frequent use of the F Word, the ""God"" word and ""Christ"" to replace other options then I will be likely using the OFF Switch quite frequently going forward"

Most of the action happens in the confines of the studio floor between George Clooney and Jack O'Connell.
Meanwhile Julia Roberts is managing everything from the production gallery, the police are poised outside ready to attack and various other players fight to work out a real world solution to the hostage situation.This is a perfect weekend movie!
It has big stars playing great characters on a very small stage.
The tension is broken up with some very funny and unexpected moments.Mostly it is a little bit silly but there are some quite poignant moments.Not sparkly enough for a Friday night film but it never tires to be.
I really enjoyed this."

" ""Mad city"" all over again...
",-0.4939,0.1227,2019-12-08 00:00:00,5,"Money Monster has a good cast, the story is passable and walks in the same shoes as Costas Gavras Mad city which also had a really good cast. The thing is that their many elements of the film that are not well thought. Examples are many: the score (that has the power to create an ambience normally...), a really disappointing camera angle in many scenes that does not capture the action as it should, the acting does not seem well guided even for George Clooney.Still you can pass your time with this movie.Conclusion: not good enough."
" Money Monster banks its thrills on a basic yet competently approachable hostage situation.
",0.3612,0.9358,2019-10-08 00:00:00,6,"Thrillers revolving around the New York Stock Exchange aren't unknown. Money devised as a property of greed is a simple yet relatable plot device and Foster, for the most part, exploits the green dollar well in this overlooked feature. Part satire on informational TV shows with all their flashy onscreen effects and manic mayhem, part commentary on America's fraudulent financial system. It's a thriller built upon sturdy foundations that aren't quite fully utilised, forcing the story to be somewhat investable but with the chance of bankruptcy. Egotistical Lee Gates, the presenter of ""Money Monster"", is held hostage by a civilian after stock market IBIS Capital collapses due to $800,000,000 mysteriously becoming misplaced.Who is the real antagonist? The criminal driven by desperation, holding an entire production crew hostage with a jacket enveloped in explosives? The presenter strongly advising the public to invest in a stock corporation that seemed too good to be true? Or the entire Stock Exchange, as wealthy stock brokers commit fraud to finance their own greed in spite of the delicate lives that purchase their stock? The answer is both none of the above and all of the above. Foster toys with antagonistic motives for each character, whilst explicitly defining one primary villain throughout the runtime. She competently explores each perspective whilst questioning the legitimacy of certain business practices which consequently affect innocent and naive citizens. Intertwining these sentiments with an enjoyably entertaining thriller resulted in a feature that really deserved the money and time invested in watching it.The notably commanding performances of both Clooney and O'Connell made for some impactful conversations on morality and desperation, merging snippets of character backstory with the current explosive scenario. Roberts and West, whilst made their presence known, were unfortunately under-utilised with Foster unable to balance the multiple themes with the expansive cast. The film works best when it's intently focused on O'Connell and Clooney's tantalising chemistry in the confinement of the studio.The third act meanders from this, literally taking to the streets of downtown New York, rushing and convoluting certain plot elements. The Mambo miner's strike seemingly undercooked and developing minimal impact to the narrative. What didn't assist in this department was the lack of common sense for some of the characters, in particular Diane. The audience worked out the ""computer glitch"" issue almost instantly, yet the apparent intelligent Diane took well over an hour to figure it out herself. Highly unlikely to say the least. The script also lacked that sharp bite to make the thrills ""edge of your seat"" worthy, often resorting to humour to relinquish tension. Although, the use of viral Vines during its conclusion had me unexpectedly chuckle.Foster confidently orchestrates a thematically expansive hostage situation with a plethora of differing tones. However, it's with these clashes that the thrills are often diminished, turning this feature into a dollar store as opposed to a luxurious department complex. Still, ridiculously overlooked. A flick so highly enjoyable with Clooney contagiously having a suspicious amount of fun, considering the situation that ensues..."
" Expected better from Jodie Foster
",0.4404,-0.961,2019-06-30 00:00:00,5,"Just a few observations from the film.1) The beginning part of the film until the hostage situation made zero sense to me with the financial jargon and the concept of the show""Money Monster"" itself.2)Julia Roberts as Patty was totally wasted in the film. To her credit, she does rise above the scope of the role. There are far too many close-ups of her.3) Only the two lead actors have any kind of emotion on their face. The extras have deadpan neutral expressions even when they are in a crisis situation and may possibly face death.4) George Cloony appears agitated only in the beginning of the film. As the film progresses, there is hardly any change in his expressions even when the disgruntled investor threatens to press the red button several times and brandishes a gun in everyones face5)The film plot gets more and more ludicrous as the film progresses. They allow the girlfriend to yell at him and disturb him even more instead of just cutting off the video6) The whole parade of George Clooney and Jack O' Connel's character Kyle with droves of people coming to see them at the risk of being blown up seems too far fetched."

I really liked how they had two moments where the opposite of what I was expecting happened. One was when he was trying to raise the stock prices and it just failed. Another is when they brought his pregnant girlfriend on. I thought for sure they were use her to make him feel bad and stop what he was doing. But instead she did the exact opposite and made the situation way worse. I was also satisfied with the ending"
" Shoulda Bought a Low-Cost, Diversified Index Fund!
",0.0,0.7213,2019-06-29 00:00:00,3,"""Money Monster"" is essentially a silly film where a struggling truck driver who has no savings inherits $60,000 from his mother's estate and invests ALL of it in a stock recommended by a stranger, i.e., the stock picking TV star of the show ""Money Monster"" ably played by George Clooney (a loose proxy for James Cramer of CNBC's ""Mad Money""?). In the subsequent week the stock goes to virtually nothing and the (extremely) angry investor storms the show's studio and holds the show's host and assorted others hostage with a gun and a bomb until he gets some answers from the stock's executives. I'll let other reviewers admit their spoiler content and tell what happens in this hostage situation, except to say it gets increasingly nonsensical.The film uses the aggrieved investor (terrorist?) as the catalyst to confront and indict ""Wall Street"" for its greed and chicanery. But just who might we include in the ""greedy"" camp? How about all those investors, including perhaps this one, who want a big return over a quick period? This reviewer hears ads all the time for investments ""previously reserved for the big guys"" that offer ""tax-free, double-digit returns with no risk."" I simply smile and walk away remembering the old adage that ""if it sounds too good to be true, it is too good to be true."" Anyway, the hostage situation in the TV studio affords the filmmakers more dramatic license as the cameras and sound stay focused on the harrowing situation, and the hostage-taker and his captive are filmed and broadcast to all the bars in the country as they, and others, try to ascertain what happened to the $800 M that disappeared from IBIS Clear Capital's (the stock) market cap, presumably all or most of it. An audit by public accountants or an SEC investigation would presumably be a more effective, but more prosaic, means of ascertaining this information, but of course less interesting to filmmakers, and audiences.We discover that the villain in this film, the CEO of IBIS, made a failed $800 M investment in an African mining venture based on a miner's strike ending. As far as I can determine there was nothing illegal or corrupt that he did (except for the attempted bribe of the union's leader), but he's certainly guilty of stupidity and arrogance for essentially betting the company on one investment beset by a strike that he thought (hoped?) would be short-lived, and for not vetting it with his BOD and senior managers. And perhaps for misrepresentation to shareholders if he didn't reveal his company's plans. Since IBIS's value was near zero, then presumably an $800 M losing investment was initiated by an $800 M market cap firm. That's a concentrated investment, and not very smart; but if his wealth is tied up with IBIS, then he suffers too.And then at the end of the film we hear the voice of Robert Reich decrying investing in the ""Wall Street casino."" Let's remind ourselves that gambling at the casino is a ""zero sum game"" in that what I win, the house loses, and vice versa, whereas investing is, and has been, a ""positive sum game"" in that investors, in the aggregate, earn positive returns over the long-term so long as the economy continues to grow."

It's not a bad movie, it's just far from great. Very forgettable overall, yet could have been so much more done differently, it's a smart concept. All this taken into account of course, Julia Roberts can do no wrong."

" Clooney playing an unlikeable character? This I've got to see...
",0.2023,0.5429,2019-02-23 00:00:00,5,"Money Monster has an interesting premise. The arrogant, show-off Anchor of a popular Financial TV show is taken hostage live on air by a viewer who followed the advice of the show to a ruinous end. Initially it seems there's a chance to see something different here. Chiefly, Clooney playing an unlikeable character. Very soon however, the promise of the premise fades.The movie seems to want to be many different things and comes up short on all of them. The main problem is that everything about the film is convenient. It doesn't work as a Thriller as the various moments of real tension quickly evaporate through our realisation that characters will have a change of heart for the good or that the show's crew can access any people or technologies they need, just in time.The ending of Money Monster is 'broadcast' right from the off and none of the pay-offs are truly earned. The central characters don't develop as much as turn on a dime and by the end, what we're left with is a mundane vehicle for Clooney completists."
" Better than expected
",0.4404,0.7851,2019-02-10 00:00:00,6,"MONEY MONSTER is another addition to the sub-genre of hostage thrillers and one that reminded me a lot of that little-remembered '90s movie MAD CITY. It's not as good as that, but it's far better than its representation would have you believe. George Clooney is the TV show host protagonist here, doing his usual charismatic stuff on the outside but adding in some much-needed depth throughout and thus making his character more interesting. Jack O'Connell is a left-of-field choice as the antagonist but his edginess comes across well and he gives an interesting and watchable turn. Julia Roberts is the only weak spot, really, and her character feels like padding, not adding to the scenarion in any way. The film offers some much-needed satire of American TV and the financial market, and keeps the viewer on his or her toes."
" A great thriller

" Disturbingly Good
",-0.1027,0.8688,2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,"19 May 2016. There are some elements of the Sidney Lumet's Oscar winning ""Network"" (1976) in Money Monster both concerning television broadcasting. Yet what director Jodie Foster attempts to direct is more challenging. The tone of her movie is off balanced between dramatic and humor and by the end, she has somehow transformed the climatic scenes into both despair and gladness. Most of the camera shots are confined to the broadcast station itself, offering little in the way for the primary characters to move and confront a wider-ranging environment. In some ways, they are literally live on stage performing before a huge television audience.Jodie has her actors play it quite straight and serious along with a shifting perspective on the hostage taker. There is an amazing scene where the hostage taker is confronted by a close intimate friend of his. It's difficult to imagine that most audience members will leave the theater completely satisfied feeling something was either missing or directed or scripted in ways that the American audience didn't pay to see. Jodie is directing to her own drum beats and offering up a different action drama for the public. In short this movie may be disturbing and under-rated, but actually good as a reminder of the toll our society takes on its citizens."

The plot revolves around one of those entertaining stock investments TV personalities whose live show gets interrupted by a furious investor, brandishing a gun and wearing a bomb vest, who lost a ton of money on the hosts' investment 'advice'. He wants the world to know that everyone involved is a swindler. Will the threatening person live long enough to uncover what really happens out of the television spotlight? If you overlook the police response as not by the book and some other reality checks, this is an entertaining movie that holds your attention for the duration as a social commentary that many can relate to. Toss in Julia Roberts and Clooney which helps the movie producers rake in the dough more honestly than Wall Street."

The acting was superb from Clooney's over the top role as a money advisor to Robert's slick producer guiding Clooney and O'Connel through an intricate script.

" Decent thriller which doesn't fully explore the morality at the heart of its plot
",0.1027,0.7684,2018-05-30 00:00:00,7,"Lee Gates hosts a successful TV show about investment tips. Posing as a deliveryman, Kyle Budwell invades the show, hangs a bomb vest round Gates' neck, and threatens to blow him up live on air unless he gets an explanation as to why an investment tipped by Gates left him penniless. As time slips away, the police try to figure out how to shoot Budwell without activating the deadman switch he holds.Money Monster - the name of Gates' TV show - is a simple, straightforward thriller. The linear story has no great plot twists, there are no huge surprises other than a general uncertainty as to exactly how it will end and, in many ways, this is a completely routine example of this type of movie.But it has three great performances at its centre. Up and coming English 25-year old Jack O'Connell as Kyle, gives a portrait of a man who is juggling a number of different problems, any one of which could push him over the edge and possibly already has. He is seriously scary and hugely sympathetic at the same time, a monster hiding a mouse. Julia Roberts, a serious contender for My Least Favourite Actress, is very good indeed as studio producer Patty. Just about to quit and take another job, she remains in place and uses incredible resourcefulness to keep both Lee and Kyle alive while simultaneously trying to track down the true story of what happened to Kyle's investment.And George Clooney as Lee shows us a man who is vain, thoughtless, shallow and cowardly, yet who hasn't entirely lost touch with decent values as he endures a situation which turns out to be something of an epiphany for him.What happened to Kyle's investment isn't vastly surprising, although the details of it and the piecemeal discovery are quite good fun towards the end of the movie. If I had a criticism, it is that there are wider issues (the morality of high finance generally) which are not addressed, but that doesn't matter too much: the film is mostly screamingly suspenseful. I'm not offering any spoilers about the ending, though - you'll just have to go and see it.Jodie Foster's direction, the performances, and a decent script elevate this straightforward thriller to well above average."

Guess the reviewer didn't find ""Money Monster"" all that correct in terms of the way the stock market works.Thankfully, I was unaware of that while watching ""Money Monster"" from 2016, which should have been so much better than it was. Director Jodie Foster did some good things here but ultimately missed the boat.The story concerns a Jim Kramer-type TV host, Lee Gates (George Clooney) who advises people about stocks on his show. Unfortunately, one of his big recommendations has somehow lost $800 million. A delivery man, Kyle Budwell (Jack O'Connell) a stockholder out $60,000, sneaks onto the set with a bomb jacket, demanding to know where his money went. Behind the scenes, Gates' director (Julia Roberts) speaks to Gates through his earpiece, encouraging him to stall for time while they try to get answers. The CEO of the company is on a plane somewhere, leaving his PR director (Caitriona Balfe) holding the proverbial bag.The cast does a terrific job, but this was a tension-filled situation that didn't seem to have a great deal of tension. And as a satire about greed, it's all over the place. As the rap-performing stock analyst, Clooney is great; but the character disintegrates -- he goes from master showman to feeling sorry for himself as he shares his story with the interloper. Normally I'm no fan of Julia Roberts, but she is wonderful here as a true professional doing her best to defuse the situation, keep Gates calm, and move people to safety.A stronger point of view would have helped ""Money Monster,"" but in the end, there wasn't much focus."

Moreover I didn't buy the transformation of Lee Gates, the host of the financial advice show. At the beginning of the movie, Gates is a loudmouth and shallow egotist, as vain as an unusually self- satisfied peacock, but gradually he finds (or rediscovers) his soul and conscience. I find it more believable that the man would remain an unpleasant jerk, simply because that's his most essential self.Still, the movie deserves at least some stars because it highlights and condemns one of the most incomprehensible features of our economic system, to wit the fiction that money can fall through a crack in our time-space continuum and disappear.Allow me to explain. Suppose, for instance, that you're the owner of a painting worth ten thousand dollars, and that you lend the painting to a museum, for an important exhibition. In the middle of the night you receive a call from the museum director, who tells you that the painting is gone. Everybody would accept that you have the right to ask the director some searching questions. Everybody would also accept that the director would have to provide some serious answers. He couldn't just say ""The painting turned into a wisp of smoke"" or ""A fairy touched it with her magic wand"" or ""It saw a flock of wild paintings flying south, and it answered the call of the wild"". Or imagine that you own a magnificent race horse worth ten thousand dollars. You confide it to a trainer. In the middle of the night the trainer gives you a call and tells you that the horse is gone. Everybody would accept that you have the right to ask the trainer some searching questions. Everybody would also accept that the trainer would have to provide some serious answers. He couldn't just say ""It changed into a beautiful butterfly"" or ""The first emperor of China came to fetch it, so that it might become his immortal steed in the afterlife"".And yet, strangely, you could lose a sum of ten thousand dollars - say, the savings of a lifetime - without anyone batting an eyelid or without anyone offering an explanation. Your money is gone and it would be un-gentlemanlike to suggest that it might have been stolen or mishandled or mismanaged : it has disappeared through a crack in the universe. So sad, but these things happen all the time. Now stop complaining - you wouldn't want us to think that you were paranoid, now would you ?""Money Monster"" does suggest a) that the sudden absence of large sums of money might be linked to evils such as fraud, incompetence or abuse of power and b) that it might be a good idea to give the victims a chance at justice and redress. This is only the most elementary of basic good sense, and yet the movie, by defending this point of view, is more morally advanced than many a highly paid lawmaker."
" A Fast-Moving Hostage Drama
",0.0,-0.9767,2017-10-18 00:00:00,8,"This movie not only indicts the corrupt practices of stock market companies but also critiques TV companies who, by dumbing down financial advice shows, can induce gullible or ill-informed people into making disastrous investments. It illustrates how investors who can least afford to lose their money, are often the greatest victims and roundly ridicules the absurd kind of spin that's often used by PR people to try to defend the indefensible.The good news is that all of this is done in the context of a fast-moving and highly-entertaining hostage drama that's compelling to watch and never gets too heavy-handed. It's well-written, well-acted and features an interesting group of characters who are all changed in various ways by what they experience.Fast-talking Lee Gates (George Clooney) is the host of a cable TV show in which he advises his viewers on all matters relating to their finances. His style of presentation relies on a lot of showbiz-style razzmatazz and a considerable amount of ad-libbing which is a continuous source of annoyance to his long-suffering director, Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts). In his latest show, he's due to interview the CEO of a investment company called ""IBIS Clear Capital"" whose stock mysteriously collapsed and left its investors with losses that amounted to $800 million. After being informed that Walt Camby (Dominic West) won't be available to interview because he's had to fly to Geneva at short notice for a business meeting, Lee has to make some last-minute adjustments to his show.A little while after the show has started, a delivery man walks onto the set, pulls out a gun and orders Lee to put on a vest that he says is filled with explosives. Kyle Budwell (Jack O'Connell) had invested in the IBIS stock which Lee had recommended to his viewers and had lost $60,000 which had been the entire sum left to him by his late mother and was all the money he possessed. He's furious and wants to know why Lee's advice was so wrong and why IBIS had lost so much money so quickly. He wants straight answers and is prepared to blow everyone up if he doesn't get them.As the hostage situation continues, the ultra-cool Patty Fenn who had originally pulled the plug on the show puts it back on air at the insistence of Kyle and prompts Lee through his earpiece on the right things to say to avoid provoking his captor. In an effort to get the answers that Kyle wants. Patty and Lee manage to get IBIS Chief Communications Officer, Diane Lester (Caitriona Balfe), on the show and she claims that the company's losses were attributable a glitch in one of their trading algorithms. Not only does this not convince Kyle but it also sounds less than credible to Lester who then embarks on the course of action that ultimately leads to the real reason being uncovered.""Money Monster"" is enjoyable to watch because it tells a topical story and features content about big companies and PR spin that chimes strongly with the kind of views that are most commonly expressed by members of the general public. George Clooney and Julia Roberts excel in making the changes their characters go through seem perfectly understandable and Jack O'Connell, in a strong performance, expresses Kyle's anger, desperation and frustration at being financially ruined by the actions of cynical individuals who are not only infinitely more powerful than him but also seemingly don't have to take any responsibility for the misery that they cause to others. Ultimately, this is a fine movie that impresses by simultaneously entertaining and providing food for thought."

Suppose you took it upon yourself to hold them accountable and liable? That's the premise of Money Monster. A story with twists and a good bit of mystery as well. The first fifteen to twenty minutes are setup then once the explosive antagonist is on screen you won't take your eyes off it. It is reflective of the distrust society has in the financial system so much so that at it's mid point you will most likely be rooting for the antagonist rather than opposing him. I was fortunate to not have any of the plot points of this film spoiled in spite of seeing it late and was glad I watched it.

I also cannot imagine the host cooperates the man's revenge to the company that make the stock price low. I cannot believe it because I cannot cooperate with the person who point a gun at me. The man also puts a gun on the table, so the host can snatches it, if he tries it. I do not like this movie because I cannot feel tense in spit of the suspense movie.

The movie clearly wanted me to sympathize with someone who is barely a step below a terrorist with the excuse that this Wall Street guy is worse. I'm sorry, I know that the banks screwed us all over but if the director (Jodie Foster) wants my heart to bleed even a little for this punk she failed very hard. I spent most of the film hoping the SWAT guys would kill him quick. Film wanted to be another John Q clearly but I actually did feel for Denzel Washington in that situation unlike here. Likewise Money Monster wanted to wag its finger against the monied elite but failed to land any punches and settled for more of a shrug toward the situation as a whole and instead focuses on one CEO who may or may not have done anything illegal anyway. Having a hostage taker rage about how he lost all his money on a bad investment in this case really didn't capitalize on the controversy that Wall Street is facing right now.There also seemed to be an attempt to look at the public at large and how it reacts to seems to attach itself like a parasite to ""breaking news"" stories such as occurs in this film. I suppose like the morality of going outside the law to address a ""wrong"" like in John Q, here Money Monster wants to take a point from Untraceable and pass judgment on the age of social media. Again only doing so halfheartedly and only scratching the surface. Honestly it rather bored me as it took time away from George Clooney and Jack O'Connell the characters who really mattered here I wasn't expecting much and a good thing that as I wasn't too disappointed at this barely mediocre and preachy soap operatic film."
" Money is a Monster.

And that is the type of humor this movie had. This is the kind of man, in his $1000 dollar suit, who himself is a cliché, would treat everything and everyone like a stereotype. The humor is legitimately funny, because it is genuinely, actual.Money Monster was compelling. I feel its greatest flaw was (given the fact that the whole hostage taking was a big part of this film), perhaps how the N.Y.P.D. handled the hostage situation. They seemed to lack a bit of that tactical finesse they're supposed to have. 1% possibility of killing the hostage taker is something I imagine is frowned upon, let alone the hostage himself. Yet, in Money Monster, the Captain was willing to risk the hostage, based on a 80% on 80% chance??! What kind of policing is that?However, I'll reiterate, Money Monster was gripping. As a viewer, you almost get yourself in a situation where you wonder, what if you were actually watching the news, instead of a movie? It's mention of viral vines, and that ""extra"" towards the end, after all the mayhem, getting back to his foosball game, also very actual, and Money Monster did that a few times pretty well. They may have not been realistic at points, but, they were actual at a few others.The plot was an interesting one. The vast majority of money is, air. So, air goes missing over night, people suffocate, and no explanation is given, but clearly, a reason exists, but it's not what they say it is. That, is intriguing, because, it's a subject that really is, more than just a movie. Commodities do this and that all day, based on that and this. The question is, the $800 Million question is; What is that, and what is this?I was pleasantly surprised with the film. George, Julia and Jack were more than adequate and Jodie Foster was competent. The score at points was superb, and I imagine Henry Jackman had a lot to do with that. I give it 7.4/10."

He's self centered and petty. He wears costumes and does the macarena at the introduction to his show, which is shot on a New York set full of elaborate displays of electronic junk. Julia Roberts, the show's director, is in the control room behind a glass panel, providing the voice in his ear. Then, during one routine but colorful show, Jack O'Connell sneaks onto the set, holds everyone at gunpoint and makes Clooney don an explosive vest. O'Connell, an ordinary working stiff from Queens, has lost his life saving investing in a stock that Clooney had pimped and that had then dropped like a plumb line, just like mine always do. O'Connell angrily queries Clooney about the $800 million lost in one day by Ibis Corporation. Well, the situation is tense, I can tell you.The technology was sometimes over my head. There were TV cameras and monitors all over the place and prominent use was made of smart phone like Blackberries and Blueberries and everybody is texting one another and shouting into microphones and making sure their earplugs were properly seated in the external auditory canals and I don't know what all. This sometimes induced a confused state of consciousness but didn't interfere with the essence of the plot. The CEO of Ibis had used a manual override on the algorithm (or ""algo"") and sneakily caused the stock to drop after shorting it. Something like that, anyway. Clooney, having just found this out, accuses the CEO of fraud. But is it? It sounds more like larceny of some sort, or maybe embezzlement. No matter.It was directed by Jodie Foster, who is smart and who knows her way around cameras. She does a decent enough job but the details of the script are torturous and sometimes you can get lost in them. Who's shouting to whom around here? And how in the name of Bog could she have let O'Connell get away with waving that pistol around so wildly -- and holding it sideways, something that became a cliché many years ago. It made me wince.Clooney is fine, as usual. He's a pretty good actor. There are a plethora of stars that play action scenes impassively, but when Clooney is batted around the set or has a pistol shoved in his face he looks genuinely scared. Have you ever seen (or imagined) Clint Eastwood or Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone look truly scared? No? I thought not. The best they can do when threatened with lethal force is look mildly annoyed.Julia Roberts is Julia Roberts, looking no less good without ten layers of iridescent make up. Caitriona Balfe is just fine as Ibis's PR person, formally known as a chief communications officer. She's very sexy and she's Irish. But I felt sorry for the aggrieved Jack O'Connell. He overacts wildly, uses a fake New York City accent (he's Irish too), and has some sort of speech impediment, causing him to deliver a pale simulacrum of his most passionate lines. At the same time, he certainly LOOKS the part of the washed out urban loser.All together, not a bad movie but not a particularly well-done movie either -- not even a glimpse of Maria Bartiromo. Better to have to sit through ""Money Monster"" than to have invested in Lucent Technology."

Money Monster was just that. It seems that most of the budget was spent on Clooney and Roberts, while skimping on the writing and the other bland, boring, bad actors.

The guards on the door don't even blink except for one of them saying, 'Who's the new guy?'. It's the ease with which he does it that's the point. ""Money Monster"" may be a movie of high ambitions and missed opportunities but if it tells us anything it's that the potential lunatics and terrorists aren't in Iran or Iraq but on home turf and are walking the streets with impunity.It starts brilliantly. As the smug TV host George Clooney is superb, as are Jack O'Connell and Julia Roberts as Clooney's director but it slips into satire much too soon and the comedy is pretty feeble, even if the initial premiss is sound, (O'Connell and millions of other investors have lost everything thanks to Clooney's on-air advice). It's at its best when sticking to the hostage situation and the relationship that develops between the hostage and hostage-taker and while it stays in thriller territory it is genuinely exciting, Director Jodie Foster gives it all she's got and with a better script you can see just what this might have been. Still, it's certainly no dog and as multiplex fare goes it's probably as good as it gets."

She is excellent in her role, the character is someone you would want in the life threatening situation. She was clam and centered, if anything the character deserves a medal for being collective in that circumstance. While clooney is lee gates, an over the top show host and unfortunately gets caught in a tricky situation. There are moments where gates draws in some laughter.

In fact, I dismissed it and kept pushing it down my watchlist. It took me until today (9 months to the day of its release in theaters) to finally sit down and decide to watch it. The first 5 minutes of the movie had me thinking that I could end up turning it off as it was probably another boring cliché predictable storyline. When the man came on set and shot his gun the first time, I was drawn in. Eventually, my peaked interest became captivation. I felt like I was hostage to the tragic scenario just like the characters in the movie. While the writing allowed for way too much profanity, the acting and storyline were brilliant. Eventually, plot twists become realized and we are left in tears at the end of this movie. But its not the acting, the writing, nor the emotional movement that made this movie what it was. Its the message. Listen to what its saying. Its not some toothless cliché like other critics claim. There is real legitimate truth. This movie is called Money Monster for a reason.

Budwell invested $60,000 based on advice that Gates had given on said company during a recent broadcast. Whilst Budwell initially blames Gates for his investment going sour, he soon learns that this 'thing' is much bigger than Gates himself.Money Monster, like Wall Street, is another film that conveys the familiar message that 'Greed is bad.' In itself, this makes the film an OK, and perhaps even worthy film, but it's also very good in many other ways....In its basic form, this is a tense thriller where a reckless individual holds another individual hostage due to a personal vendetta. In this respect, as a thriller, it does work well and is crammed with excitement and intensity. The scenes between the hostage and kidnapper, the backstage crew and the police are all well-played out and each section of the film is well-constructed, exciting and rarely dull.Our antagonist Kyle is an interesting character whom we initially feel some sympathy for, but much of the sympathy we have for him becomes undone as we learn more about him. He invests his full $60,000 inheritance - although I wasn't sure why he invested the full amount when he had that much money? Why not invest half of it or even a quarter of it? Still I suppose some people are just reckless, impulsive or simply blinded by greed which are all things that I feel that this film was trying to highlight. It's probably fair to say that Kyle is just as greedy as the CEO of the firm that conned him out of his money, but I don't think that this film is trying to start a moral debate about who is greedier than who, but rather that one's own greed is the real enemy and it also acts as a reminder that greed itself is often the winner in such circumstances.The performances from the likes of Jack O'Connell, Giancarlo Esposito and Julia Roberts were all superb and George Clooney (who is very hit-and-miss in my book) was every bit as good as his supporting cast.All in all, it's a fine film that although slightly familiar and predictable still manages to provide plenty of entertainment."

It's hard not to have sympathy with his character with the endless smug investor professionals on TV peddling their greed on a daily basis. Clooney is as smooth as usual and Julia Roberts does her usual decent job. Hostage type dramas have been done to death and it takes something special these days for a film to excel. This one doesn't really excel but there are aspects of it that at least try and be different to the usual clichés. The story started to lose my interest after the first half hour but the tension does thankfully build and rescues the film from a slow death. I like the message behind the movie that greed is bad and wealth can't protect you and as an undemanding thriller this does the job. Just don't expect to be blown away by it.
" Fails to make it rain
",-0.4215,0.9912,2017-01-29 00:00:00,5,"A genuine attempt at both a satirical black comedy and an expose of those nasty big corporations flirting with peoples livelihoods and their money, Jodie Foster's Money Monster is the type of film that doesn't quite feel like an out-and-out failure but is very far from a home run, and that Money Monster has come and gone from cinemas and people's minds is testament to the fact this film is a bit of a non-event.Recruiting her star buddies George Clooney (in what continues to be a lean patch for the silver fox following on from films like The Monuments Men, Hail, Caesar and Tomorrowland), Julia Roberts and rising star Jack O'Connell into this initially intriguing set up of O'Connell's pushed-too-far truck driver Kyle Budwell taking Clooney's money guru TV presenter Lee Gates hostage during a live broadcast, feels like a half complete script that writers Jamie Linden, Alan DiFiore and Jim Kouf struggled to turn into something believable or as interesting as the set up feels ripe to be, and Foster's turn behind camera isn't enough to make proceedings workout.With the story quickly getting a little too much to bare, much of the film's saving graces come from the work of the trio of main actors, and while Clooney could do this role in his sleep, Roberts in particular does well with a rather generic ""kindly producer"" role and Jack O'Connell, while not fully utilized, does showcases the intensity seen in his brilliant turn in the magnificent prison drama Starred Up and to a lesser extent Unbroken and '71.O'Connell truly is one of the stars to watch with the young Brit possessing a screen presence not dissimilar to a young Al Pacino or Robert De Niro, and should directors harness this intense commitment its likely we will be seeing the performer deliver on his undoubted potential, whereas Foster lets him go astray with his New York accent and hyperactivity that at times takes away from his solid moments.Money Monster isn't a bad film, but it never once gets close to becoming a great one, even if the opening 10 – 15 minutes seem to suggest it could well have been. The film continues on an interesting career path for Jodie Foster who shows slight improvement here over her misguided comedy The Beaver, but has a large gap to make up before she can be considered a director to keep a close eye on, as this Money Monster unfortunately doesn't make it rain.2 ½ ointment creams out 5"

Julia Roberts plays the director of the show who spends the entire picture telling Clooney how to act in order to survive.The ending was excellent where Clooney winds up joining the young man in the exposing of the fraud perpetrated by the CEO of the company- creating chaotic conditions so that the stock can fall and then when it does, buy it back in big numbers.A very good example of corporate greed and those money-makers whose greed imperils the rest of society."
" Cheesy doesn't work with a topic like this.
",0.3612,-0.7,2017-01-14 00:00:00,5,"I never, ever ever everrrr thought I would use this joke but Money Monster is forcing my hand. Hey, Money Monster! The 90s called and they want their textbook action-thriller plot back. Seriously, this film was just annoying. They take a serious modern day issue and turn it into a complete cheese fest. The film is about an idiot who made a bad bet on Wallstreet and etc, etc. Did like a Wallstreet banker write this film? The most is annoyingly safe 'edgy' film of the decade. It pulls a bunch of punches and you stop caring about it after 20 minutes. Oh, and how they try to modernize it by using Youtubers and social media stars is just the icing on the cake of fail."
" a movie about a cspan type network...
",0.0,-0.9646,2017-01-14 00:00:00,3,"is just not that interesting. We have Lee Gates whom hosts an investment show on some news network. One day, a guy, Kyle, shows up and is angry with Lee because he lost a large amount of money bases on Lee's recommendation. He pulls a gun and puts a bomb vest on Lee all the while wanting answers as to how this sure bet company lost 800 million dollars. Patty is the show producer feeding Lee info and what to say.Soon, we learn the company's CEO is caught in some lies and Patty and others track down the truth as to why the company lost 800 million based on an algorithm that it's creator said was impossible. FINAL VERDICT: You never get the feeling Kyle is going to shoot Lee and you just know the CEO is going to turn out being bad. Those money news shows are just boring and so was this movie."
" Disgrace (contains spoilers)
",-0.4939,-0.8175,2017-01-13 00:00:00,1,"I am so furious of the movie, the plot, the approach, that it is my first review and my first rating as ""1"".Capitalism and its errors have to do with ""bad guys"", doing ""bad things"" and the system structure has nothing to do with it, is the bottom line of the movie. The whole plot and especially when the guys start walking down the streets (COULD THAT IN ANY WAY HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE???) is ridiculous, an insult to common sense and to the audience's time spent on watching this absolutely worthless piece of Hollywood propaganda.Some could say that the approach is meant to be ""light"", but light does not mean idiotic in any way.It's a real pity for Roberts and her history as an actor (Erin Brockovich), but for Clooney as well, who has up to now demonstrated a more tasteful selection of roles."
" Jodie Foster probably thought she could pull of Inside Man.
",0.0,-0.9661,2017-01-03 00:00:00,5,"Money Monster would be a better film if it were a little bit more interesting and a little less boring. My biggest complaint wit this film is that it doesn't feel like it really accomplishes anything. Even by the end, when things are revealed, I couldn't help but simply not care about any of it. Lee Gates is a flamboyant television financial expert and recently called the stock on a company known as IBIS a SAFE BET. That safe bet wasn't exactly true, as the company lost 800 million dollars and some of that money belonged to down on his luck delivery man Kyle. He decides to take matters into his own hands and demand answers. So the logical thing to do is hold Gates hostage at his studio. It's up to Patty, Gate's studio producer, to calm him down and talk him through the situation while Kyle demands answers to questions no one seems to be asking. I guess big name celebrities don't sell movies as well as they use to. George Clooney and Julia Roberts would have been a slam dunk success a decade ago. Now they are relegated to this mess and no one seems to care. It's not like they do a terrible job here, they are serviceable to the mediocre story. If you wanna see George Clooney act like a fool dancing around with a big gold chain around his neck and a gold top hat, you're in luck!!! Money Monster is a film for you!!! A lot of the film centres around Clooney and Jack O'Connell standing around waiting for other things to happen. Hostage flicks have the disadvantage of being limited to the specific location where the hostages are. Yet so many of those films remain thrilling. The Negotiator for example, is an excellent film about a hostage situation. Money Monster is not. The fault might lie with the director, Jodie Foster, but I blame the script. The characters are not interesting enough, the situation does nothing to engage the viewer and the final act fails to bring any tense action to this lacking thriller. There are many questionable moments here, but the main one is the primary focus of the film. There is no way that the producer would keep the live broadcast going through this situation. Even with the threats from the gunman, it would have been cut. For a film about the financial industry, it doesn't seem to know it very well. Nor does it seem interested in educating the viewer on how things happen. How about when they leave the studio, bomb strapped to Clooney's chest and the dozens upon dozens of civilians just standing around. The NYPD seem very stupid in this film. I can't really recommend this film, especially when it thinks its such a smart film too. It feels like Jodie Foster had a great time on Inside Man and thought ""Hey, I can pull this off""No, you can't."
