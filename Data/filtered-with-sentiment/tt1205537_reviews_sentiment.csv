" An Honest Review
",0.5106,0.9834,2021-04-04 00:00:00,1,"Chris Pine does a really good job, brings his A-Game.Keira Knightley, well, OK, she is pretty under-rated and ALWAYS seems to bring her A-Game even to the worst possible movies.... and she brought her A-Game again.And Kevin Costner, well he can be off the mark every now and again, but he seemed to try his best to make this movie good.And that is why it's watchable. Pine, Knightley, and Costner all bring their best games to this film and do their absolute best to make Shadow Recruit a good movie........ and this is despite the HORRIBLE SCRIPT and mostly incompetent direction. Branagh has always been a better actor than he ever was a director, and when it comes to a movie that needs to be taunt and stressful.... they needed someone else.But then, they also needed a script that could build tension and a director that can work with it, not just do the same trick he failed to execute properly with Frankenstein.So what you have here are three actors conspiring to save a movie... and unfortunately you need more than three actors doing their absolute best to save a film from a poor script and a poor director."
" Full of horrible cliches
",-0.5423,-0.6901,2021-03-30 00:00:00,2,"Regret that I've watched this movie. The movie is full of cliches in a very poor way. The story line is very thin. Not even a single moment of exciety. Pity, because the cast looked promising."

It's an edge of your seat thriller that is real enjoyable to watch. See for yourself. Maybe I would have cast someone else as Chris Pines girlfriend Kerra Knightley as I am not a fan of hers at all. 9 out of 10.
" As Jack Ryan movies go, this one rates in the top third
",0.2023,0.7469,2021-03-14 00:00:00,8,"Pine is a believable Jack Ryan, Kiera Knightly lovable but a bit too controlled as his fiance who learns of his status as a CIA Agent, and just shrugs it off as ""o.k, I thought you were having an affair"". It is a shame they chose to go a different route with the next story.. Pine would have grown into the role but Knightly would probably have had trouble fitting the stereotypical ""mother raising kids at home"" that Clancy clumsily wrote. Branaugh did a good job directing, especially the final 5 minutes. Took the easy way out with his own character. Spoiler alert* a truly skilled agent would not have stood at the side of the road while his boss drove up and whacked him. That is not the Russian way, a real agent would have tossed a live grenade in the window, setting up a return for the sequel."

",0.7269,-0.8834,2021-01-08 00:00:00,4,This movie was a terrible disappointment. It started off okay but then it goes down very quickly. Every plot twist was an attack on your intelligence and common sense. The way Russian villains are portrayed cannot be more clichéd than this film. I watched once when the movie was released and I tried watching on TV after a couple of years out of sheer boredom but no I couldn't manage more than half way through. Save your time for something else.
" Unexciting, muddled and with no interesting characters
",0.128,-0.9647,2020-12-29 00:00:00,2,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit stars some big actors, (Chris Pine, Keira Knightley, Nonso Anozie, Kevin Costner and Kenneth Branagh) which makes it all the more worse when they have nothing good to do. The plot is very poor, a generic cold war action thriller, being an original story and not adapted from one of Tom Clancy's novels makes it difficult to fully get into, and it doesn't help that the story is extremely muddled and disjointed. The end fight makes no sense especially after the villain is taken supposedly beaten up in the underground and then apparently reapers inside the car with the bomb (?), the car that somehow managed to get out of the underground and onto the streets in seconds. Furthermore, the film is worse than James Bond and not a proper Jack Ryan adaption so that leaves it in a terrible grey area, it has no personality of its own and relies on other films to inspire it as a cheap knockoff.The fight scenes are one positive, they're fairly intense and moderately well done, none of them are great but they're passable. Character development is there but is poorly done, there's no solid conclusion and the relationship between Chris Pine and Keira Knightley isn't there.2/10: Absolutely do not recommend, one of the worst spy thrillers I've ever seen"
" Childish & amateur

He discover a Russian named Cheverin is involved in some dubious dealings, he must now travel to Russia inorder to investigate. Upon his arrival he also learn that Cherevin is planning a dangerous terrorist attack in the US.
I don't know what to make of this movie. it's just a pile of clichès upon clichès. If you've watched one movie from the espionage/action genre then you've already watched this film. The storyline started rather unique and interesting until it turned into the clichè stop-the-terror-attack-in-the-last-second toward the end, and of course the protagonist will save the day in a last-second-save style of course!!!The action sequences are good and fun but it could've been more than that with better editing, Acting is fantastic tho, Chris Pine brings his A game, and is the saving grace of this movie. Kenneth Branagh makes a good 'Russian' villain and the rest of the supporting casts are so-so. The score does it best to complement the scenes but still end up short, the cinematography and effects are satisfactory.
All In all, Jack Ryan: SR doesn't bother to bring anything new to its genre but like most action thrillers, it is pretty entertaining, nothing more nothing less."
" The story is really Tom Clancy
",0.0,0.9254,2020-11-23 00:00:00,7,"A reasonable action movie about Jack Ryan.
In recent weeks I have seen the 2 seasons about this CIA agent and they clearly have more time to explain the story in more detail and better. The first is set in part of the Middle East and the second part in South America, Venezuela.Quite different from this film, which mainly takes place in Moscow and in which a different actor plays the role of Ryan. To be honest I liked the characters in the series better, John Krasinski (Jack Ryan), Wendell Pierce (James Greer) and Michael Kelly (Mike November) I really liked their roles and they came across very convincing.
Not that Chris Pine doesn't look good as Jack Ryan, but it is a matter of getting used to. It is a pity that they did not work with the same actors for the main characters, the films do not differ that much in time.
As far as this film is concerned, the action is especially blood-curdling later in the film, the set is beautiful and the story is really Tom Clancy.
A 7."

" An entertaining thriller with a familiar plot
",0.5106,0.8683,2020-11-02 00:00:00,8,"Shadow Recruit comes with a plot that can be described as a mixed bag of stereotypical tropes, fairly believable outcomes and a predictable conclusion.The characters follow a similar concept as the plot, thus creating a group of familiar figures that one expects to see in a spy flick that focuses on a Russian plot against the United States. However, the performances are for the most part good enough to make the viewer forget about the insufficient character development.Furthermore, a big plus lies in the fact that the Russian characters do speak Russian among themselves at all times, instead of forcefully using English like in so many similar movies these days.Finally, there are several exciting chases and fights that are reminiscent of the Jason Bourne movies and contribute to the fact that Shadow Recruit generally turns out to be a gripping and entertaining thriller."

" Technically Interesting
",0.4019,0.912,2020-07-31 00:00:00,6,"As a physicist, I like this film for various extraneous reasons. For instance, the concept of stealing data via the mains supply recalls an old (circa 1980s) pre-bluetooth idea for linking household devices in which a high-frequency signal was superposed on the high-voltage supply. Secondly, the use of a 'Green' light-bulb as a torture device highlights the manner in which the general public has been hoodwinked. That is, a full cost/benefit analysis shows that the energy-saving arising from using such bulbs is negated by the extra cost resulting from the safe disposal of used bulbs. Of course, little attempt is made to do so safely, leading to pollution of the environment: so, not very Green after all! On the more general theme of 'pollution', all of those movies in which the heroes receive the personal thanks of the US President have been forever tainted by the present incumbent. Just imagine the relevant scene in this movie. Imagine the Tangerine Testicle probably taking the credit for their success. Advice to directors: never again include such meetings in new movies: Trump has poisoned that well for the foreseeable future."

" A GOOD SPY THRILLER WITH A GOOD LEAD IN CHRIS PINE
",0.7351,0.9982,2020-05-05 00:00:00,6,"I'm starting to become a Chris Pine fan & can understand why Quentin Tarantino has said that Pine is his favourite of the ""Chris's"" (Pine, Hemsworth, Pratt & Evans) all guys are good in their own way & each has made some excellent films each & all have their own fans.
Chris Pine still feels the most underrated & low-key of the bunch in my opinion as he pops up in lots & even leads films like the new Star Trek films & is a main lead in the Wonder Woman films & held his own next to Denzel Washington in the fantastic Thriller, Unstoppable & has obviously made alot more but Pine still doesn't feel ""Big"" like a huge movie star as the other Chris dudes seem much Bigger!!!
But Pine is a fine leading man & is very good here as Jack Ryan in this slick action Spy Thriller, now this film isn't on the same level as Harris Ford's 90's original Classic's but it's still a good movie & entertaining.
This is more an origin story for Jack Ryan & how he ended up working as an Analyst for the CIA & Pine is very good as the character & i genuinely like the guy as an actor & here he's got the beautiful Keira Knightley as his love interest & plays opposite the great Kenneth Branagh in a Russian villain role, who also directed this & it's a shame this flick bombed as a sequel would've been Awesome, also the great veteran actor Kevin Costner stars as the guy who wants to recruit Jack Ryan.
Jack Ryan has some good slick action & thrilling scenes that makes it a nice little thriller that's not over the top.So far Pine has been best in Tony Scott's runaway Train Thriller Unstoppable but he's usually good in whatever he pops up in & does solid work in most films."

" Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit spies on Bond to replicate aspects and become re-Bourne.
",0.0,-0.982,2020-02-03 00:00:00,5,"Clancy's series of intense novels involving CIA analyst turned operative Jack Ryan have had several adaptations in the past. A film franchise that suddenly, after 'The Sum of All Fears', became dormant for over a decade. With cinema evolving and experimenting with action sequences, Jack Ryan had seemingly retired from fieldwork, unable to compete with the big boys. Then, a reboot was commissioned. This reboot, to be exact. Having no relation to any of Clancy's existing work. An original story that had no limitations. The end result? Meh. It's fine. But much like a shadow, it disappears in the nightfall of Moscow. After a spinal injury during Operation Enduring Freedom, Jack Ryan is recruited as a CIA analyst only to then be brought forward as an operative to uncover fraudulent behaviour from a Russian tycoon who seeks to collapse the American economy.Actor/director Branagh proves he is a versatile talent. From tackling classic Shakespeare to whimsical Marvel productions. The thespian is a, and please do excuse the pun, Jack of all trades. Directing a plausible central scenario that feels apt for the modern financial climate. It's not a case of constant combat for the sake of having two guys throw fists at each other, there is some intelligence buried within. An imminent financial collapse after a staged terrorist attack on Wall Street is credible, and Branagh's sleek direction consistently places this scenario at the forefront.The problem however, is Ryan's transition between analyst to operative. The first half of the feature showcases some dedicated character development for Ryan and his fiancée. A barbed relationship weighed down by Ryan's career secrecy which Muller convinces herself is actually participating in an affair. Then, Ryan goes to Moscow without any real explanation, because apparently he is the only person best suited to job. And gradually, with each passing minute, the spy thrills become more generic and less engaging. His first kill, despite having no training in fieldwork, is against a hitman double his size. Then, after confronting the sinister Cherevin in his lavish office, Muller decides to conveniently fly herself to Moscow to challenge her fiancé over the accused adultery. Unfortunately, she comes across as the most needy individual ever, likening Knightley's usual prowess to a mere object. The CIA then involve her (let's be honest, they wouldn't) and it just becomes an absolute mess. Seamless infiltration leads to a mediocre car chase which then leads to the climactic punch out.Each narrative stepping stone is executed to the most precise calculation, yet lacking genuine thrills. Several edited scenes were messy and obviously had no relation to the previous location, most notably the exploding van. However, Pine's committed central performance was enough to level out these prominent errors, even if his tense face exudes a constipated look and thus further distracting me. Knightley's talents were offensively wasted, and Branagh's heavy Russian voice resembled a mediocre pantomime villain. He's no Vladimir Putin, let's just say that.As a reboot, Shadow Recruit didn't exactly tear down the Kremlin with its tour-de-force spy shenanigans. Yet it's not terrible in the slightest. Jack Ryan, much like the man himself, is fine. Enjoyable to watch, but utterly forgettable the next day."

As for Mr Pine, the script hardly does him any favours as he hops miraculously from one impossible situation to the next up waves of top Russian hit squads. He's about as convincing as a C.I.A. operative as he was as a Captain Kirk. - which is not at all. Jack Reacher: Shadow Recruit is a trite copy of the standard counter-intelligence film and a rather poor one at that.

It's a genre that has just fallen out of my interest, as they all seem to be the same combination of bland writing and been-there-done-that violence. Based on what I knew of the plot and the names behind it, I expected Shadow Recruit to be a smarter-than-average, but still by-the-numbers take on the famed Tom Clancy character. I got what I expected, and not much else, really. To its credit, Jack Ryan makes a pretty good first impression. Chris Pine (Kirk from 2009's Star Trek), Kevin Costner, Keira Knightley, Kenneth Branagh directing, and the writer of Schindler's List. What emerges from this pool of venerable talent is, at heart, just another action-thriller, with the requisite fistfights, car chases, and race against the clock. It's all very well-done, to be sure, with fine performances and some snappy dialogue punctuating the occasional monotony. Fans of the genre or source material, or just the casual filmgoer, will have a good time. But it doesn't come without a cost."
" A review of ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" (2014)
",0.0,0.9959,2019-06-18 00:00:00,6,"""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" (2014) is easily the least of the Tom Clancy adaptations. But that shouldn't be enough to indict the film; the other film treatments of the author's books have all been roundly excellent. (Okay, 2002's often-reviled ""The Sum of All Fears"" might be an exception, but I still like that flick even if I'm in the minority.) I'd rate this outing a 6 out of 10.It isn't a bad movie ... it's just an average, generally undistinguished boilerplate spy thriller that seems half-heartedly rewritten as a reboot of the Clancy films. Screenwriters Adam Cozad and David Koepp pay cursory attention to the title character's background, and a key plot development from the books that I will not spoil here. But the film utterly lacks the mood, detail or methodical plotting of anything Clancy created.It's all very generic stuff. We've got a generic, telegenic, twenty-something action hero (Chris Pine), his generic hot girlfriend (Keira Knightley), the expected Russian bad guy (Kenneth Branagh) and a by-the-numbers climax - including the last-second requirement to divert a bomb from its target. Rounding it all out is Kevin Costner, the most generic good guy ever to behave predictably on screen - he characteristically projects the expected, wholesome gravitas. Even this film's title is generic - it sounds like the name a marketing department would come up with for an entry in a video-game series.There are plot elements that are painfully implausible, even by spy-movie standards. Jack Ryan's new girlfriend, for example, surprises him by arriving in Russia in a flourish of quirky-girlfriend spontaneity, only to discover his secret career and then be fully enlisted in a spy operation. Branagh doubles as the movie's director; his work here is surprisingly problematic. This is yet another movie in which important action sequences are barely comprehensible because of frequent, rapid cuts.Oh, well. It certainly isn't all bad. There isn't a single bad actor in the film, for example. If I don't like Branagh's directing, I love his acting. The guy is magnetic - he alternately and convincingly projects menace and charisma to perfection. Alec Utgoff shines too, in a small role as a soft-spoken, ironically disarming Russian assassin.People tend to either love or hate Costner. I like him quite a bit. No, he doesn't always demonstrate an incredible range. But his acting is competent and he's likable and consistently convincing. He's the actor equivalent of that old American sedan that isn't flashy but always starts reliably when you need it to get you to work.Hey, you might like this movie far more than I did. I was an obsessive fan of the books, so my standards may be a bit high where they are adapted to the screen. Your mileage may vary."

While the action, camera and sound design were definetly on the good side, the plot tries to get some depth going, but it just does not get it right enough to convince and to be remembered.The introduction works, despite beeing a bit cliché. Soldier gets injured, meets his great love and gets recruited by the CIA by a guy who has the ""seen it all""-look on his face.Then the money and time saving ""x years later"" headline happens and semi-broken man is now an agent doing business men things.

A plan is made to do agent things wich then gets a twist that works okay, hadnt it been teased so hard before, it would have worked better. There is a 6/10 tension at this point. The main problem beeing that every hurdle is jumped via ""CIA has an insider"". While copying data to a flash drive, there are things are explained wich nobody asked for.
The best persuit scene in the film follows, action is good, tension is not quite as high as I would have liked. Camera work is excellent here, not too much not to little movement.A typical main character scene follows. He is an analyst, sure, but how do pieces of information click for him put not for a team of CIA agents?For some reason, the film then closes with a ""double ending""."

Tom Clancy's now famous character creation - CIA analyst Jack Ryan - has been through many transformations actor wise and the tales are uniformly engrossing and entertaining. In this 2014 version adapted by Adam Cozad and David Koepp the title role is assigned to Chris Pine who brings a fresh, young, somewhat laidback version to Jack's bright mind an allows his vulnerability to love and friendship to alter his manner of approach to deadly problems. For this viewer, the more human quality works very well - especially when comparing Pine's interpretation to the many other snarly similar characters that continue to flood the screens. Kenneth Branagh brings polish to the direct as well as to the 'other' important character of the story. Jack Ryan (Chris Pine), as a young covert CIA analyst, uncovers a Russian plot to crash the U.S. economy with a terrorist attack. He begins attending the London School of Economics. 9/11 happens - he drops his studies enlists in the Marines, sustaining severe injuries when the chopper deploying him to Afghanistan is shot down. While in intense rehab, nursed by med student Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley), he grabs the attention of Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner), a man who works for the CIA and who would like Jack to finish his studies, get a job on Wall Street, and seek out terrorist plots through their financial transactions. Ten years later Jack finds anomalies in the accounts of a Russian named Cherevin (Kenneth Branaugh) and thinks he should go to Russia to check out what's going on. He's told not to tell anyone who he is, including his girlfriend Cathy, which makes her doubt his fidelity when she catches him in some lies. In Russia, Cherevin assigns someone to assist Jack, but when the two are alone, the man tries to kill Jack instead, so Jack kills him. Obviously, Cherevin is hiding something. Jack goes to meet him and says he'll bring his fiancée along, but the tables are not set for quiet dining but for further dangerous intrigue. Supported by a strong cast including Colm Feore, Peter Andersson, Lenn Kudrjawizki, Eleana Velikanova, Nonso Anozie among others, the pace is steady, allowing character development instead of just explosions and killings. The musical score by Patrick Doyle is mood enhancing and the cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos is atmospheric. In all, this is a very fine 'JACK RYAN' feature - and it is sad that it did not do well in the theaters. Grady Harp, September 18"

This flick has great suspense, plus some decent fights & chases. Kevin Costner plays Ryan's recruiter & handler. This is a good supporting role for him & he delivers (never felt he had the range to be a lead-Kevin should sign up for any secondary role he is offered).

The character development is extremely shallow when you consider this is supposed to be the origin story for a man who goes on to much greater things. The plot is also weak with a bad guy who seems to pose little threat other than dirty looks with a scheme involving banking to tank the US dollar. This is all to go down with a coordinated terror strike on US soil by a sleeper cell that never seems to fully wake up. That story seems to have been an after-thought.

A chill went down my spine when Scots character actor (and a very good one, too), David Hayman, appeared as a Russian apparatchik. I know, a Scots accent is virtually indistinguishable from a Russian (I mean, it's all the same that side of the Atlantic, isn't it?), but it's not a good sign when the cliche of USA goodies vs Rest of the World baddies appears again.

" Handbook of how to mess-up a reboot
",0.0,-0.9553,2018-03-13 00:00:00,5,"Watching this movie leaves me absolutely stunned how one can mess this up. You have a line of charismatic and first-class Hollywood actors and, given Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan, a successful franchise which provides a lot of story and background. In short - all the ingredients for a successful reboot are there. Given his appearance in latest Star Trek, Chris Pine also proved himself as suitable candidate to do so. 
Unfortunately the creators messed the whole thing up by overloading the story: Within the first minutes Jack Ryan watches the WTC fall, participates in war on terror in Afghanistan, get insures, learns how to walk again, meets his future wife and get recruited by the CIA. To much? - hey, wait for the main plot and the other characters. Kevin Costner (introduced as recruiter of Jack Ryan) reappears again as main contact and a sniper (!) on a mission in Russia. Keira Knightleys character is rather schizophrenic as she turns from jealous girlfriend into an undercover agent and then into the understanding spouse. The main villain's (a Russian oligarch - thank for trying, Kenneth) motivation is the one of a dying true patriot wanting to leave a legacy to his family. That does not stop him from getting distracted by preferably married women and wasteful dinners. Anyway, the legacy part becomes particular disturbing as one learns that his only son lives the life of a sleeper on US soil since he was nine and is now destined to execute a suicide mission on his father's behalf. 
Next, I sense creative disagreement whether his is supposed to be a spy movie, a character study or an action movie. Maybe one should have briefed the director and cutter on that. In its current state it is unclear which scenes actually contribute to the plot. The relevance of the action sequences are trapped somewhere between 24 and Transformers. A pity..."
" Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit
",0.0,0.7233,2018-03-10 00:00:00,5,"Tom Clancy re-heats the Cold War from the grave in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, a streamlined reboot of a 1990s-rooted Paramount franchise in which the United States is saved from another 9/11-sized catastrophe altogether too easily. As the fourth actor to portray the title character in a five-film series thus far, Chris Pine adequately follows in the footsteps of Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck in what also amounts to an origins story about the character's trial by fire in the CIA. Commercial prospects look solid, if not spectacular, for this efficient, if ultimately rote, political thriller. While it benefits from an attractive cast, the perennial allure of the spy game and the exoticism of the contemporary Moscow setting, the biggest problem afflicting this modest diversion is that it's the sort of film in which computers get to the bottom of every problem that comes up in about five seconds. It seems like half the running time consists of characters in cars, vans or planes, in their offices or hotels or just on their cell phones managing to download or send whatever secret information is in play with a click or two, and nevermind such cumbersome annoyances as passwords or user IDs. And no one ever needs to call a tech supervisor.What actually is in play here is the value of the American dollar, which is what Russian oligarch Viktor Cheverin (Kenneth Branagh, directing himself onscreen for the first time since Hamlet) aims to collapse along with Lower Manhattan in a coordinated terrorist attack. With the Kremlin in cahoots with him as a silent partner, the plan is to bring the Yankees to their knees in a way the communists were never able to do.Equally nationalistic is Jack Ryan, first seen here watching the attack on the Twin Towers while a student at the London School of Economics. Inspired to help his country, he's soon in uniform serving in Afghanistan, where he has the misfortune of being shot out of the sky in his chopper, but the good fortune to be nursed back to health by a beguiling doctor, Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley, complete with an American accent), with whom he takes up as soon as his treatment is finished.There is a certain generation-spanning pleasure in watching veteran CIA handler William Harper (Kevin Costner, in low-key authoritative form) set Jack up as a financial intelligence analyst within a big Wall Street firm, where he spends a decade before being given five seconds to pack for his mission to Moscow. Despite living together, Jack can't tell Cathy whom he works for, and when she discovers a ticket stub for an afternoon showing at the Film Forum of the old thriller Sorry, Wrong Number in his pants pocket, she's convinced he's having an affair. Who knew that downtown venue for revivals and arty fare was a popular spy information exchange spot?Once Cheverin is identified as the key to the gross international monetary manipulations, Jack is charged with accessing the key files the Russian has hidden from view. In a scene that doesn't make much sense, Jack is put to an immediate physical test by his Moscow airport greeter, a mountainous Ugandan bodyguard who tries to take him out as soon as they reach the hotel. Unexpectedly, Cathy then turns up in Moscow and finally must be told what her husband does for a living, leading to the film's high point, a dinner scene at a fancy Moscow boite during which the couple enacts an elaborate charade that allows Jack the chance to steal secret info from Cheverin, whose vices -- vodka, vanity, women -- are neatly exploited.Such key plot elements as financial-based terrorism, lingering Russian animosity towards the U.S., sleeper agents and the electronic world providing the main battleground are aptly handled and the action is plentiful, if not terribly unusual. The relationship between Jack and the woman he dearly wants to be his wife is appealing, and Branagh's villain is shot through with deep historic bloodlines (his office is dominated by a huge painting of Napoleon being turned away by Russians).But there's at least one car chase too many and the climactic one, in New York as the seconds tick toward another downtown disaster, feels jerry-rigged specifically to include every cliché in the generic urban suspense playbook. Instead of embracing dramatic complexities and setbacks, all the better to make the most of them creatively, screenwriters Adam Cozad and David Koepp are intent upon steamrolling right over them, to uninvolving effect.
Pine is fine as the uniformed-turned-covert patriot; he lacks the physical stature of his predecessors and it's not entirely believable that he could prevail over the African bodyguard who turns on him. Beyond Costner, Branagh and Knightley, all good to have around, the cast doesn't possess the sort of depth or number of prominent players that the earlier Jack Ryan features did. Technically, the film is sharp, with Moscow panoramas supplemented by scenes of Liverpool doubling as the Russian capital."

Chris Pine is neither Alec Baldwin nor Harrison Ford. The performance is a pedestrian one by a generically handsome young actor. The story begins with an ill-done action sequence in which Marine Pine is involved and horribly injured in a helicopter crash, just so we don't lose the action crowd right off the bat. He's recruited by the CIA and spies on some rogue Russians who want to obliterate the United States out of revenge for our having taken part in their defeat in Afghanistan. It would be nice if someone helped us out of our involvement now, after a decade and a half. The last third of the movie will be appreciated by any fans of the James Bond movies."

If you loved Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan movies, I'm not sure how you'll react to this reboot with Chris Pine. I never saw the originals, so to me, this was a brand new action movie.I wouldn't call myself an ""action movie gal"" but I do enjoy the genre. Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit earns a place at the top in my book, right up there with Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible movies. The action scenes are exciting, and between Kenneth Branagh's menacing Russian bad guy tactics and Kevin Costner's air of mystery, the tension keeps you hooked throughout. Also, usually in action movies there's some sort of comic relief. Sometimes the humor is stupid, but not in this one. There's a clever banter written in for the lovebirds, and it gives you a laugh without making the movie silly.Now, I'm the first to admit my bias, so here it goes: Keira Knightly is my favorite modern actress. Keira plays Chris Pine's girlfriend; even though she doesn't have a very big part, she is my favorite part of the movie and the reason I keep watching it. I mean, what man alive wouldn't go to the ends of the earth to keep her out of harm's way? Shadow Recruit is a really good action flick, perfect for a guys' or girls' weekend. And there aren't any sex scenes, so it's a great date movie, with eye candy for both of you!"
