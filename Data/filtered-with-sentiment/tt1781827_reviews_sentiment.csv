" Fight for your ... life/country?
",-0.3818,0.3612,2020-12-31 00:00:00,8,"Our main character here is temperamental - you know he has a temper and is mental ... and old (dad) joke but a good one I think. Also one that is not so far removed from the truth. This is based on a true story and a real life boxer. Yes another one of those. But while we do know certain tropes and cliches, I would argue that this movie does have a few nice ideas it can add.Now whatever you may think of the lead character here (and sometimes he seems to be on a mission to make us/the viewers but also the other people in the movie hate him), there is a troubled past. Now some may say that is no excuse for some of his actions. And yes I do agree. There also convinient timings of bad news that surpass or make others forget about how bad the main character acted ... so yes what I'm trying to say is, this is deeply flawed. But it is also quite enticing, with a stellar performance by everyone involved.The box scenes seem well performed (to my amateur eyes that is) and the tension builds throughout the movie ... as the character never seems to be able to leave his past behind ... or will he be able to?"

The performance also was great from all cast.if you want to know who is Duran, you can watch the film in 2 hours and you will know one of the greatest boxers in history."
" Great plot based on the life of Roberto Duran, worth more than it's rating
",0.7184,0.9212,2020-02-10 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed the story which I am not familiar with. Robert De Niro, Edgar Ramirez and Ana De Armas are great together and take you into it. Usher also very convincing as he really look like Sugar Ray."
" Very Disappointing With This.
",-0.5413,0.9073,2020-01-02 00:00:00,4,"I was incredibly excited when I found out that there was a Roberto Duran movie coming out. Being a humongous fan of Duran and being a huge boxing fan of the 80's and 90's, I was looking forward to this.Man, watching this film and I went in with so much excitment only to be terribly disappointed. It was awful, all over the place, forgettable acting, poor boxing sequences. The director took a whole bunch of creative license with Duran's life that I honestly don't know what was real or not. I honestly thought everything was made up and nothing was real.So, Hands of Stone and Bleed For This both came out around the same year or close to it and both did extremely poorly at the box office which shows that real life boxing movies just don't do well in comparison to fictional boxing movies because fictional boxing movies allow for more, much more creative freedom.
Also, I did not need to see Usher's Butt cheeks on my TV screen. He played Sugar Ray Leonard in the film. Avoid."
" Boxing with no blood
",-0.296,-0.4751,2019-11-02 00:00:00,8,"Outstanding lead performance from Ramirez. Ok it's no raging bull or Rocky for that matter but it tells an inspiring story of one of the most underrated and frustrating boxers of our time.
De Niro awesome as always and the story flows with conviction.
The boxing scenes are well shot and frenetic enough to not need the gruesome style of Raging Bull, problem being for real boxing fans they may find that frustrating.
Overall recommended for fans of boxing history for a mainly untold story."
" Occasionally cliche but still beautifully performed
",0.7227,0.903,2019-09-11 00:00:00,8,De Niro felt like he was at his best for a long while in this film a passionate performance in fact most of the cast milked every drop of passion and emotion into this film. Occasionally it was a little cliche for my liking following the same route as many generic boxing and sports films in general but still managed to be thoroughly entertaining.
" Boxing sequences directed by a Labrador with a GoPro.
",0.0,0.996,2019-09-09 00:00:00,7,"Hands Of StoneHands Of Stone tells the story of boxing legend Roberto Duran.
A film that sometimes gets the storytelling right but takes an eight count for poorly choreographed boxing sequences. More on that later.
Starring Edgar Ramirez as the great fighter his performance here is rather good.
Quality support from Robert De Niro as his legendary trainer Ray Arcel is a given.
The utterly gorgeous Ana de Armas is also great as Duran's partner.
To be honest I could watch Ana de Armas doing something as mundane as collecting carpet samples, but hey that's just me.Hands Of Stone is a decent boxing movie apart from the dire boxing sequences which are so muddled and incoherent they look like they've been directed by a Labrador with a GoPro strapped to its back.
Storytelling jumps around Duran's timeline with no warning making the film a challenge to comprehend.
Even so the script does enough to explain Roberto's life struggles.
His growing up in Panama to his in the ring rivalry with All time great Sugar Ray Leonard.
Sugar Ray is played here by Usher who does an adequate job at portraying the legend but ultimately he doesn't have Leonard's vibrancy or charisma.
I'm a huge fan of the genre.
Rocky, Creed, Raging Bull are all classics.
Hands of Stone fails to live up to such talented movies.
This is a film that is better when it doesn't focus on the fighting.
It's a crisp looking movie with a nicely clean transfer.
Audio is adequate for this type of movie but like the rest of the package it offers nothing to allow it to stand toe to toe with Rocky or the recent Creed movies.
I enjoyed Hands Of Stone but I don't believe the film did Duran's life story justice."
" Forgettable boxing pic
",0.0,0.6908,2019-08-28 00:00:00,6,"""Hands of Stone"" is a pretty average biopic/boxing movie. It tells the story of Duran's life, skimping on quite a few details, and throws in de Niro as legendary trainer Ray Arcel to sweeten the deal, and a miscast Usher (the R&B star) as Sugar Ray Leonard.It is, at least, a good late career performance from de Niro, who seemed to have quit trying in his performances some twenty years ago, and just started sleepwalking through his roles. Here, he downplays it, but that feels like a conscious decision, and one that pays off in an impressive, understated performance.I think the problem is that the movie tries to show too much, and ends up feeling light on the ground. A better decision may have been to focus on Duran's famous rivalry with Leonard. Instead we get a predictable rags to riches boxing story, and the attempt to blame the infamous ""No Mas"" fight on Duran's history with the US seems unconvincing. I still don't know what really happened in that fight. Perhaps the filmmakers know, or perhaps not."
" ""Tu eres mi campeon.""
",0.0,0.9874,2019-03-15 00:00:00,7,"For those of us who never saw the 'No Mas' fight between Roberto Duran and Sugar Ray Leonard, either live or in clips, news of Duran's giving up led you to believe (at least me) that he was being sorely outmatched and would have been in danger of being knocked out. The film paints a somewhat different picture, instead suggesting that Duran's quitting in the middle of the ring had all to do with the way Leonard attempted to humiliate him by his showboating and brilliant footwork. Duran took it as a personal affront that Leonard didn't come at him like in the first fight, where it was all ring skill and trading punches. Leonard's loss of the Welterweight title in their first match had to do with his attempting to fight Duran's fight, and not use his own style. So I can appreciate the picture's ability to put that all into perspective.The first thing that grabbed me in the picture was the physical resemblance of the two actors portraying Duran and Leonard. Edgar Ramirez had an uncanny likeness to Duran, more so than Usher Raymond for Leonard, but still pretty acceptable for the story. Robert De Niro looked nothing like legendary boxing trainer Ray Arcel, but most viewers wouldn't notice that in the picture unless you were a devoted boxing fan. The story traces Duran's rise from poverty in the streets of Panama to the heights of the boxing world, often times revealing his early hate for the United States because of the way his American father abandoned his mother with a handful of kids. When he eventually meets his father, he's taken aback by the man's appearance due to his Mexican heritage. It felt like at this point, Duran's attitude began to change somewhat, particularly with his trainer's belief in him without regard to nationality or ethnicity.The one thing that didn't compute for me though was the way actress Ana de Armas appeared after having five kids as the wife of Duran. Her stomach was still washboard thin and her figure looked dynamite. It might not have been so noticeable without those poolside scenes, but because they were in there, I just had to shake my head. You know, there's poetic license and then there's realism, so the film managed to cut both ways.Overall though, without knowing anything about the background of Roberto Duran, I thought this was a competently told story about one of the legends of boxing. The film doesn't shake out as one of the best boxing films ever made, but the emphasis wasn't so much on cinema as it was in telling an effective story. It was gratifying to learn during the end credits that Roberto Duran shared with his home country some of the wealth he accumulated during his long career. The man probably wasn't as bad as earlier portrayed, with the effect of time smoothing out his outlook on the world at large."
" Excellent
",0.5719,-0.7074,2017-12-28 00:00:00,8,"That's one of the best boxing movies made since several décades, since RAGING BUILL actually. At least for my taste. Performances are awesome and characters depiction too. But there is a scene I don't understand. After Duran shouted after his guests around his swimming pool, you see one of these guests in a street restaurant, grabbing some fodd from a tourist plate, run away and then being hit by a car whilst he escapes...
 Why this scene? Which link with the story? This character was no more than a simple extra...
 No one seems to have noticed this strange line in the film."
" No Mas
",-0.296,0.699,2017-09-15 00:00:00,8,"This is a biopic of Roberto Durán (Edgar Ramírez). It shows Durán in Panama as a child and incorporates the background of US/Panama relations. As an adult the film concentrates on his relationship with Jewish trainer Ray Arcel (Robert De Niro) who acts more like a life coach, whispering the fight strategy into Durán's ear right before the bout. How about ""The Boxer Whisperer"" for a title? It is a bit like the ""Rocky"" series as we see Durán rise up hungry from the streets and winning in a close decision. He then goes on a winner's binge and parties too much, only to lose to Sugar Ray Leonard (Usher Raymond). Durán regains the ""Eye of the Tiger"" by fighting in a prison. I guess there are only so many variations a boxer's life we can actually have. At least they spared us the training music montage. The film implies Roberto Durán's trash talking was a strategy to get inside another fighter's head.In addition to representing the pride, joy and hope of Panama, Roberto Durán also represented its anger and embarrassment. It was an interesting film, and of course has a lot of ring fighting.Guide: F-word, sex, and nudity (Ana de Armas)"
" Don't need to be stoned to enjoy this one!
",0.5411,0.9943,2017-05-19 00:00:00,8,"You have been warned. There will be plenty of pun jabs in this review, but please don't count me out yet. Roberto Duran, the legendary Panamanian boxer, is in the center ring in Writer-Director Jonathan Jakobuwicz' bio pic ""Hands of Stone"". Jakobuwicz features Duran Duran, and more of Duran; I just did that so I could include one of my favorite bands of all time in this review. Anyways, Edgar Ramirez stars as Duran in a bit over-the-top performance but still had a few uppercuts in his work. The film features Duran as a child living in the Panamanian slums, and then as a young man who loved the boxing game, next his eventual rise into the ring, and lastly his legendary battles with boxing champion Sugar Ray Leonard. Jakobuwicz also presents Duran's personal life in his relationship with his girlfriend and then wife Felicidad. But this movie is very much also about Duran's seasoned trainer Ray Arcel, who is played with plenty of punch by the great Robert DeNiro. Arcel had a wealth of experience training champion boxers, but ran into a mob squad that physically & mentally forced him out of boxing. Years later, Arcel discovers Duran, and thought it was time to get back in. There is no doubt that Jakobuwicz does get a bit showy in several of the film's scenes; but you know what, I found them to be in the ropes of ""guilty pleasure"" watching. DeNiro, who needs no training in the thespian world, was brilliant as Arcel. I also enjoyed the first card supporting work from John Turturro as a mobster, Ruben Blades as Duran's manager, and Usher (yes, that Usher) as Sugar Ray Leonard. Sure, there lots of cheesy stuff in ""Hands of Stone"" that have a familiar ring to it, and yes I do think many will be sparring partners of mine by disagreeing with me on that it was an entertaining bio flick; but I don't see why you should not go head to head and eye to eye with ""Hands of Stone"". **** Good"
" the enigmatic ""No más""
",-0.296,-0.9689,2017-04-29 00:00:00,6,"In 1971, manager Carlos Eleta (Rubén Blades) introduces his fighter Roberto Durán (Edgar Ramírez) to legendary trainer Ray Arcel (Robert De Niro). The anti-American Durán rejects Arcel at first. He grew up hating America over the Panama canal and being abandoned by his American soldier father. Plomo is his street level trainer and Chaflan is his outlandish friend. He chases after beautiful Felicidad Iglesias (Ana de Armas) and marries her. Arcel had been forced to retire by mobster Frankie Carbo (John Turturro) and is longtime married to Stephanie (Ellen Barkin). Durán's nemesis becomes American darling Sugar Ray Leonard (Usher Raymond). He gets Sugar Ray by insulting his wife Juanita (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) before the first fight. However, he is out of shape for the second fight which ends in ""No más"".This is no jab at De Niro but the movie would be fine with less Arcel. This must be Durán's movie and it must be about ""No más"". We're given a formulaic portrait of a brash, arrogant, troubled Durán. Most of Arcel's story could be cut out. ""No más"" remains a mystery. He does give an explanation to his wife but continues to have conflicting narrative. This needs a tighter script which could zoom in on the most important aspect of Durán's journey."
" No Mas
",-0.296,-0.6757,2017-03-21 00:00:00,6,"The first time I saw Roberto Duran fight was the Duran v Leonard fight...... Part 2. Where Sugar Ray Leonard was showboating, doing the Ali shuffle and basically humiliating Duran. I turned to my older brother and said that Duran is a bit rubbish only to be met with a reply, he is the world champion and usually a bit of a an animal but Leonard is on another plane tonight.Hands of Stone tells the story of Roberto Duran (Edgar Ramirez) told through the eyes of veteran trainer Ray Arcel (Robert De Niro.) Ramirez is frankly to old for the teenage Duran, a wild kid brought up in poverty in Panama who becomes maybe the best lightweight ever.Duran took two big money fights with Sugar Ray Leonard (Usher) the golden boy of boxing and Duran won the first fight by taunting Leonard to brawl with him, a mistake Leonard did not make the second time.Still Duran came back after this defeat where he allegedly said 'no mas' and quit the fight. Duran would go on to become world champion in two further weight divisions.A lot of the film is actually in Spanish for the Panama based scenes, it is a competent and entertaining film of a legendary boxer who retired from boxing at the age of 50 in 2002.There is nothing in the film though that elevates it to greatness. If you have De Niro in the cast and it is a boxing film your mind turns to Raging Bull, a landmark boxing film. This is not in that league."
" Boxing. History. Biographies. Drama.
",0.0,0.8965,2017-03-09 00:00:00,8,"Yes, this is a boxing movie. However, it's not really just about boxing or a boxer. It is about world famous boxer Roberto Duran and has some fight scenes that are done with realism. The movie pays more focus on the man himself and a spectacular role played by Robert DeNiro As Ray Arcel, world famous fight trainer. The relationship between the two is one many probably didn't know. It also explores the conflict that occurred in Panama, Duran's home country, and how that shaped his views and behavior. It shows both the political side and economic side of the struggle in that country during those times. Edgar Ramirez once again shows his versatility and some how can manage to transform his age depending on the role he plays, as Roberto Duran. The rest of the cast is top notch including John Tuturro, even though not a lot of screen time, as a mafia boss. On that note it also delves into the corruption of the sport from it's inception to it's world wide fame. This is not Rocky or Raging Bull but if y0u like true boxing movies and like history you will no doubt enjoy this film."
" The God of War...
",0.2732,0.8227,2017-01-23 00:00:00,9,"From THE GODS OF WAR by Springs Toledo (speaking of the first fight- The Brawl In Montreal- between Roberto Duran and Sugar Ray Leonard): ""Fifteen rounds had unveiled a god of war."" To SOME; to those of us who followed The Game, Duran was VERY well known. (In fact, when I got in line to see The Brawl In Montreal on closed circuit television, I found, much to my amazement, that I was the ONLY person in line who thought Duran would win.) Duran as Lightweight Champion fought with a Feral Ferocity few fighters (if any) ever matched. Going into the fight with Leonard, Duran had only a single loss on his record: a disputed ten-round decision loss to Esteban Dejesus, who would be stopped by Duran in two subsequent fights. Leonard, the Olympic Gold Medalist, had never lost a professional fight. The result was fireworks of the highest Fistic order. HANDS OF STONE is at its most effective, however, during its QUIETER, more Dramatic moments, when we get glimpses into the Soul of this Fighter. From HANDS OF STONE by Christian Giudice: ""Warmth and generosity were as much a part of him as the myopic brutality he employed in the ring."" That dichotomy comes across clearly in HANDS OF STONE, which helps make it much more than ""just another boxing movie."" There are other fighters whose stories would also make for compelling movies: Jersey Joe Walcott (the Heavyweight Champion); Rocky Marciano (who has YET to be done justice on the Screen); Archie Moore (the Elder Statesman of The Sweet Science); Jerry Quarry (""Perpendicular is better than parallel...""); Alexis Arguello (suicide, my a--); Tony Ayala (tragedy on top of tragedy); George Chuvalo (one of the most tragic of ALL), etc. Looking forward to the next Round."
" Better than Metacritic says, very accurate to the IMDb score...
",0.4404,0.9775,2017-01-15 00:00:00,7,"For a biographical movie is good, mainly because, unlike to others in this genre, the actors speaks in the languages of the real people they portraits. But for a boxing movie, at times fails with the romantic drama scenes but mainly for the over egocentric personality of the main character, Roberto Durán. Also the script doesn't show the public enough matches. The highlights of the film, obviously, is Edgar Ramirez performance, but in my opinion, gives me a mixed perspective...in one hand, a confident and charismatic Durán, in the other hand, sadly, a man who blames his father for leaving his family and uses that as an excuse for his hate to U.S.A. is kinda annoying, also he thinks he's unstoppable even with his coach, Ray Arcel, played by Robert de Niro. Despite all this, the simple script is saved by some aspects. One is the costume design, because the movie occurs in many years, and the clothes tells us the time In which the characters live. The good technical aspects, like photography, sound mixing and editing, and film editing too, gives the film a better look. In overall, this movie is better enjoyed if you seek a mix between sports, drama and romance but not at its best."
