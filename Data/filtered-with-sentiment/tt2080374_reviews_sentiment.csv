" They managed to turn an interesting story into a boring one.
",0.1027,0.803,2021-04-07 00:00:00,5,"It could have showed us the beginnings, how Steve and Woz met, how they developed the first Apple, however most of the movie is just the backstage of different product presentations. You think they are gonna last 5 minutes but they last two hours. Is this really the best way to show Job's life? I don't think so."
" Dull
",-0.4019,0.5523,2021-04-02 00:00:00,4,"This movie gets a low score because it tells me more of Steve Jobs personal life, and rushes through his works of genius - which I am way more interested in.

" An engrossing film out of a dislikable character
",0.0,0.9628,2021-03-04 00:00:00,8,"Superbly directed by Danny Boyle, which is highly ironic, given that it looks and feels nothing like any other Danny Boyle film. The take on the story is not what you would expect, it isn't a biographical movie but instead it takes a remarkably original and compelling outlook that serves to flesh out Steve Jobs' persona. Aaron Sorkin, did a great job at adapting a biography without resorting to the usual structure we are so used to seeing.
Having said that, I believe the biggest flaws are two: how incredibly dislikable Steve Jobs is and the dialogue. If you wish to make an accurate portrait of Jobs, the ""dislikability factor"", is unavoidable, so it isn't due to the filmmakers. But surprisingly, the dialogue, which is Sorkin's biggest and most notable trait, turns out to be...monotone. For sure, you can expect everyone to speak with flashy words and almost poetically as always with Sorkin, but here he takes it to an extreme and uses it excessively, somehow making characters sound exactly the same, and to make matters worse they sound exactly like Jobs. One could argue perhaps we could use some more context on the other characters, but it isn't that, it's almost as if they had the same voice and nuances in their speech.
All in all, excellent directing and an original take, highly recommendable."
" Great Jobs (I hate myself)
",0.1027,0.8297,2021-03-03 00:00:00,9,"Just about perfect in every single aspect. It's completely exhilarating from start to finish, and hyperrealistic because of the wildly strong performances and intensely-written script and the tight directing. There's barely anything to complain about."
" Non stop pointless arguing
",-0.6369,0.6105,2021-02-13 00:00:00,2,"The first 5 minutes of arguing is fine, and more or less ideal for this movie, but it just keeps on going and going and going with no upshot. If someone was strapped down to a chair to watch this movie god help them."
" It honestly sucks.

Everyone's mad at each other the whole movie and they walk around with Steve Jobs as they yell at each other. Then they stand around in the same room and yell at each other.The worst part is there's not really any point to any of it at all. This movie sucks.
" Insane story, insane visuals
",-0.6597,0.3818,2021-02-05 00:00:00,8,"Uniquely directed to show a bold story that needs to be heard. The visuals are so purposeful and next-level, with performances that knock this movie out of the park."
" Jobzniak
",0.0,0.997,2021-01-26 00:00:00,9,"Aaron Sorkin writes a movie starring Fassbender about Steve Jobs which is directed by Danny Boyle. I feel like that's all any film buff really needs to know to be excited for this one. No one writes dialogue the way Sorkin does. What would otherwise be dry narrative turns into gripping prose that captures arrests the viewers attention and does not let it go. Fassbender is exceptional as the titular Jobs but is weirdly having to battle with a very strong showing by Rogen as his foil. I can't emphasize enough how impressed I was with Rogen as Woz and how much I'd love to see him do more of this kind of work. Winslet is also wonderful as his assistant, keeping him grounded and pushing him in ways he needs to be pushed.I really applaud this film for the manner in which it delivers the material as well. Jobs is not painted as a saint. He's a controlling, stubborn jerk who is going to do things his way whether anyone likes it or not. His arrogance and superiority cost him multiple times but obviously leads him to eventual, world altering success and poses the question of whether he could have achieved that if he were nicer and played by other people's rules more. It also takes place exclusively over the course of three product launch events. That's it. There's no traveling or set hopping. Three places. It creates this wonderfully strange sense of being small and focused yet somehow still so big and expansive.This really was a wonder and I loved every minute of it. I was glued to the screen for every bit of wit and repartee. Strong recommend to everyone, Apple fan or not. This was an exceptional film and one I am definitely going to be adding to my library asap."
" Another Superb Sorkin Script
",0.6249,0.9823,2021-01-14 00:00:00,8,"Not the best Aaron Sorkin written film about a tech billionaire who is an asshole to everyone, has frequent arguments with his ex-girlfriends and has a best friend who feels like the protagonist ripped him off, but it's still pretty great. The performances are pretty good on the whole, with Fassbender being the obvious standout, but it's the script that is the best element. The character dynamics are really well-developed, and I think the best scenes of the film are just the ones with two characters arguing. The dialogue is just so brilliant, as it is with every Aaron Sorkin script. This is my least favourite script from him, but it's still just so engaging to listen to, and he nails the emotional moments here. Danny Boyle's direction is also really good, and he elevates the script quite a lot. My big issue that is keeping this from a higher score is just that Steve is too much of a terrible person for me to feel emotionally connected. Now Mark Zuckerberg is obviously shown to be a terrible person in 'The Social Network', but he isn't presented to be a character that you should sympathise for. This film asks me to feel sympathy for Steve Jobs, who has been presented as an awful person for the entire film, and I just can't do that, making some of the emotional moments fall a little flat. Still, this is just a great time, and definitely one I'd recommend."
" Gripping and stimulating. Great acting & writing.
",0.7906,0.9981,2021-01-11 00:00:00,9,"One of the year's real surprises for me...not sure why I would be surprised, but I was. I expect Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet to be great,and they were. The rest of the cast was terrific too, with Jeff Daniels giving his best performance in years and Katherine Waterston giving another charismatic turn (after INHERENT VICE). Danny Boyle as director. Aaron Sorkin scripting. What's not to like?I went into the film having heard little about its ""unorthodox"" approach to exploring Steve Jobs. In case you hadn't heard, we learn about Jobs through three lengthy ""scenes"" of him backstage just before some major product launches. We see him interact with ""staff."" We see him interact with peers. With former mentors. With those closest to him. We get to see how his brain works. How his brilliance sometimes overcame his tendency to be a major, grade-A jerk (and sometimes, it didn't.) We get to know Steve Jobs, THE MAN. We do NOT really get to know Steve Jobs, the life story. If that's what you're looking for, you will be disappointed. This is a blisteringly paced, intelligent, character study.In some ways it feels like THE SOCIAL NETWORK (another Sorkin script, another tech giant who is a jerk)...but similarities are surface only. Sorkin writes in a recognizable way (a way which I find insufferable for TV, like WEST WING...but seems to work in two hour cinematic doses). But SOCIAL NETWORK tells a more traditional narrative, moving through many moments in time. STEVE JOBS examines the man's behavior during 3 critical moments in his life. (There are a few flashbacks, too). It shows how evolves, or doesn't...but it doesn't give you the ""story of Apple.""If a movie has great, juicy dialogue handled by actors of skill...I'm a happy camper. I love Tarantino. I love this film for that same reason. Talk and talk and talk and talk. I relished it. Fassbender is so very skillful. His verbal sparring with Daniels or Seth Rogan or Waterston is such fun. Winslet is there providing subtle but steady support...she is almost standing in for ""us"". She's someone who very much admires Jobs but is also horrified by his behavior. As his long time assistant, she can say things to him no one else can (doesn't mean he listens though). For me, this whole movie was just very intellectually stimulating, and it revealed Steve Jobs very well.Does it ACCURATELY reveal Jobs? Who knows? How can anyone know if a biography accurately depicts its subject. But this film, under the very capable direction of the always interesting Danny Boyle (even when he fails, his movies are interesting), presents a completely credible version of this towering figure. He's both very human and very larger-than-life. I know going forward, whenever I think of Steve Jobs, I will be inserting THIS Steve Jobs into my mental picture.And, in case I didn't make it clear before, Fassbender is great here. If you are a fan of his, or a fan of great acting, you should see this film, even if you don't care about Steve Jobs. This guy never fails to be less than interesting on screen. Not all his movies succeed (this film certainly didn't ""succeed"" for a lot of viewers) BUT he does not fail."
" Unable to recapture the greatness of The Social Network
",0.0,0.7776,2021-01-08 00:00:00,7,"This is Aaron Sorkin's second film about a technological megalomaniac billionaire. However, the film does not feel like a monotonous retouching of similar themes due to the differences between the two film's main characters.

It turned out that The Social Network was an excellent film. So, when I heard there was a movie out about Steve Jobs, I was a bit more open-minded about it. Wrong! I was pretty much bored all the way through and the quick-fire dialogue overwhelmed my senses causing me to switch off and lose interest. With Danny Boyle directing and some renowned actors playing the roles, I expected to like it, but I didn't. Hope you fare better than me with it. Good luck..."

" Steve Jobs is a fantastic biopic, a frenetic and nuanced psychological look at an enigmatic mind
",0.5574,0.9991,2020-10-13 00:00:00,9,"As I go through Sorkin films in advance of the Trial of the Chicago 7, Steve Jobs feels like the most Sorkin script yet. We get a story told in three discrete times which lets us focus deeply on the parallels between time periods and how Jobs acts leading up to the events his success hinge on. We get witty and rapid fire dialogue, amplified by Boyle's aggressive cutting between scenes that manages to work surprisingly well here. And we get characters who seem to simultaneously be specific, limited roles and also have dimensionality and feel like real people. I'm not sure how he pulls it off so seamlessly, but this is exactly the type of biopic I want: one which investigates a character in a narrow enough way to provide clear focus and nuance to their actions, which in turn allows us to gather much broader conclusions about the things which influence the character and humans in general. By telling a compelling and thoughtful story about an individual, we get a story about humanity.So aside from Sorkin's delightful script, what works in Steve Jobs? Well, all of the performances are excellent. Fassbender deserves the utmost credit for managing to portray Jobs as an acidic, rough character who we can still at times empathize with and see as a real person. Rogen, in one of the first dramatic turns I've seen from him, is fantastic in limited screentime as Steve Wozniak, adding some invaluable perspective to Jobs' past and how he treats relationships. Winslet is rock solid as his assistant, Daniels is very good, and all three girls playing his daughter do a great job. The confluence of these excellent performances and one of Sorkin's best scripts is what allows us to see into Jobs' mind; specifically, the way his early childhood feelings of abandonment over the adoption process have made him cold and mistrusting. There are so many moments, big and small, in the script that do a great job of highlighting his fundamental inability to compromise or see things from other's perspective. The first that may come to mind for many is the way he pushes Lisa away early in the film and denies that she is his daughter, especially by running an algorithm and saying that 28% of America could be her father. The one that I really loved, in part because Boyle and Fassbender don't linger on it at all, is when he's frustrated by confusion between the two Andies, Joanna tells him to call her Andrea instead, and Jobs responds ""No, I need one of them to change their name. I don't need to call them something different - I know exactly who I'm talking about when I say their name. I need everyone else to change what they say."" He almost mutters it under his breath and Boyle quickly moves on to the next thing happening to prepare for the demo, but that obtuseness and limited perspective is a microcosm of Jobs' outlook. During the film, one of my problems with it was that we see Jobs fail in the first two acts and finally find success in the third, but that very little time is devoted to why he finally succeeds. After considering the movie as a whole, I actually think this was a bold but smart choice, because it highlights his character as the focus rather than outcomes. He was always intelligent enough to succeed, but he was so uncompromising in his vision that it took 14 years for technology to reach the point that it was ready for his ideas. It's not really important why he succeeded, though; what is essential is the way he and his relationships evolve as success and failure happens. Even when he anticipates success, he condescends and is not willing to give others credit (the Apple 2 with Wozniak). When he fails, he lashes out, assuming others are to blame, and then internalizes his emotions soon after and becomes more determined to prove his brilliance. The principled, uncompromising nature of his personality is one of the clearest points made in the film and a fascinating one - the Apple 2 is one example, but his stinginess in giving money to Chrisanna is another prime example. We do get an ironically happy ending between Lisa and Jobs where he finally opens up a bit and is more willing to accept that he loves her. Their relationship is the emotional heart of the film, and it is particularly fascinating when considering the context of Jobs' own trauma with his parents. This isn't just a random psychological study, lest we forget; Steve Jobs is one of the biggest figures in modern technology and he did fundamentally change the way America and the world use technology. The frenetic pace of the dialogue and direction and the seemingly high stakes at all times are warranted. There is plenty to delve into with regards to capitalism and what type of experience the general public wants, as well as how companies manage their internal politics and deal with the external politics of the press. Steve Jobs is a wonderfully crafted film that shuns the generic biopic tropes at every turn and ends up as one of the best ever for it."
" A brilliant piece of film making, regardless of its authenticity
",0.5859,0.9625,2020-09-27 00:00:00,8,"Films like these I always think must be difficult to market in a trailer or in a synopsis (it may even sound boring). It's the type of film until you can't really appreciate how well it is written and played until you have seen it.The Steve Jobs and Apple element of the film for me is appealing (but not essential) and I'm sure there are the purists that will watch and pick fault with Fassbender's appearance, his style and temperament as jobs. But still take all the Apple theme away and replace it with something else (of equal significance) and it would still be a fantastic piece of acting from Fassbender. I tend to think of this film as an alternate reality of Steve Jobs and Apple. As I've never watched (and never will) a single interview or Apple product launch by the real Steve Jobs, this film has become my interpretation and reality of him.Really enjoyed the film and I think Fassbender and several others really proved how powerful and entertaining a purely dialogue film can be."

He come join the Apple, after that we all know that how Apple perform.In the film it's shows like that Steve Job had creates iPod for his daughter.

Actors are amazing, I love to see M. Fassbender acting, same as Kate Winslet and Seth Rogen. Now, let's talk about the story: is extremely poor written. I know this is Hollywood and was not expecting to see a documentary either. But this is not about Jobs. You can't tell a very small piece of the story without understanding the rest. This movie is about a lousy father and a person that treats everyone horribly and made tons of money. Why all these things happen, not a clue. You can't even see a piece of Job's acting on stage, everything is cut in half... it falls short in all the different angles. Kate Winslet (Johanna) seems to be Job's friend, but they don't provide too much info about their relationship except when they see each other before him presenting a product / before the events. I see her all the time also arguing with him and pointing the things that he's doing wrong. Now I will have to Google if I want to know how was she in reality. Or why the rest of Job's life is not even portrayed here (when his daughter was teenager, he was already married, etc...).

There is basically one set location for the entire movie.I've seen Molly's Game and The Social Network; they were both good. Unfortunately Steve Jobs (2015) is not good.

It felt like it wanted to be something that it was not. Where A Few Good Men had its 'You can't handle the truth,' and The Social Network had it's 'you pathetic d-bag,' moment, Steve Jobs felt like it too wanted that big showdown but we didn't get it.

Through three separate Apple launches within the span of 15 years, Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin explore the financial, cultural and spiritual evolution of Steve Jobs, the man behind the Mac. But a flawed man he was. Through mostly dialogue alone, Jobs is pried by his associates, superiors and loved ones. At times, Jobs feels soulless, and constantly focused on the finished product he is selling at the moment. Each section differs in which camera equipment it was filmed on. Act 1 is 16mm film, Act 2 is 35mm film, and Act 3 is digital. Not a bad touch by Boyle. This, stylistically, properly departs from Fincher's gloomy world of Facebook. Sorkin's screenplay is as richly developed as ever, but at times, emotionally empty. Sorkin loves the smell of his own farts. It shows. Every character kind of sounds the same. In any event, Steve Jobs, the movie, has a specific mission. To tell the story of one man, his extraordinary product, and his extraordinary mind using as little visuals as possible.

" An attempt at creating a ""new"" Jobs movie that left me a little bored and a little confused
",-0.1566,0.9871,2020-01-20 00:00:00,5,"Danny Boyle's Steve Jobs is a valiant attempt to create a biopic in a new format, but in doing so it creates some challenges for the viewer.The easiest way to make an audience automatically enjoy a movie is to create a long series of powerful, heart-wrenching, edge-of-your-seat moments. Some filmmakers grow tired of this method and try to make a new way of creating brilliant films. Danny Boyle through his Steve Jobs biopic attempts to do away with most of the major, iconic moments of Apple and its iconic founder. That means no dramatic engineering breakthroughs or genius moments from Jobs's past, which could be a serious let down for many expecting those.Instead Boyle attempts to tell Jobs's hidden story through conversation, often with his assistant Joanna (wonderfully portrayed by Kate Winslet). Aspects of Jobs's personality are revealed through his words to coworkers and his daughter, Lisa.This method of storytelling seems to go against the golden role of cinema: show, don't tell. Although many of the conversations include short vignette flashbacks, there are several moments where the viewer is left unsure of the true events. This is likely the intention of Boyle, letting the personalities of the characters take the lead role rather than the events themselves. Although the acting was excellent, I simply didn't care about events when I didn't have any knowledge of the truth. Additionally, I found several moments hard to follow due to the time-jumping nature of the three separate time periods.The most interesting topic of the film for me was Jobs's relationship with his daughter and her mother. This was a story I have not heard before, and I felt a film solely focused on Jobs's family in this format would have been more interesting. The business end of the film for me became stale.Overall, Steve Jobs left me a little disappointed with its focus on uninteresting aspects of Jobs's life and with its format which created viewing difficulties."
" Tedious Fighting
",-0.3612,-0.9272,2020-01-19 00:00:00,2,"Very annoying, tedious movie in the beginning, all the arguing and bickering takes away from who Steve Jobs was. They could have gotten a better actor (Christian Bale would have been better) than the one in this movie, although towards the end he makes a more believable older Steve Jobs than he did a younger one. I found this movie tedious already knowing the story. However, this story line was very hard to follow with all the fighting, in fact I feel like the whole movie was fighting. It's one of the worst Steve Jobs movies ever. I love the very first movie years ago, The Pirates of Silicone Valley and then Jobs was good along with Bill Gates. Both Noah Wiley and Ashton Kuchner added more character than the constant grouchyness that Fassbender portrayed.The bickering and arguing really take away from the movie.Whoever wrote the story for this movie must have hated Steve Jobs because they did a terrible portrayal of him."

Really, much talk about important things, minutes before Apple events. It seems a staged/allegoric setting, just like the ones you can find in theatre plays or in some novels from centuries ago.Also, the continuos enter/exit of the characters strenghtens this feeling you're watching a play.So, it ends up feeling a bit fake, because they choose to tell his life through unrealistic dialogues that would never happen before an event.That being said, the movie is almost enjoyable.

" Seems like you're watching a play
",0.5994,-0.9677,2019-06-06 00:00:00,5,"If you're looking for a flattering depiction of Steve Jobs, this 2015 biopic isn't it. Starring Michael Fassbender, and costarring Kate Winslet as his overworked assistant and Seth Rogen as his former business partner, the film paints Jobs out to be demanding, distant, unreasonable, and cruel. I watched this movie with my dad, and he'd just finished reading Walter Isaacson's biography on which the film was based. He said there were obvious parallels from the written words to the film, so those of you who read that biography might be interested in renting the movie.To me, the film reeked of the theater. If I hadn't watched it with my dad, I could have sworn Aaron Sorkin's screenplay had been based off of a play rather than a book. It's separated into three sections, or acts, and it could have easily been performed on a stage. Each act takes place backstage before an event, and as Steve prepares to make his big speech, the same few people come into his life with the same problems. It has a very symbolic feeling, showing that as time passes, a man can outwardly progress and yet stay stuck within himself.There's an overwhelming dizzying effect by director Danny Boyle to try and show audiences Jobs's mindset, as well as a purposely irritating score written by Daniel Pemberton, to remind audiences that when he least needs chaos, chaos finds him. I didn't end up enjoying this movie, because the protagonist was so unlikable and the theater-esque setting felt a little pretentious, but Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet's performances were worth watching. I barely recognized Kate, and Michael's constant energy was as exhausting as it needed to be.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend. During almost the entire movie, there are either ancillary images floating in the background or a fluid camera movement that will make you very sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!"""

You think from the title or the computer that you will see have
something interesting and enjoyable but at the end you will
be disappointed by what remains...I have tried to see this movie twice when running on TV, and I really
fell asleep twice,... as the content of this movie is completely insipid.
This movie is just a collection of ""behind the scenes"" discussions, purely
sterile and interpretation of Fassbender, does not bring any interest to
that movie.The only interest is to realize that behind Jobs ideal, his purpose
was to make the maximum of profit from his customers, like some
gurus in some religion.
It is just also showing in some way or obtuse the character personality was,
at the limit between obsession and autism,... but was it worth to make a
movie from that ?If I could have put a ""zero pointed"" stars to this movie,
I would have given that movie that score !The story of and destiny of ""Alan Turing"" was much more interesting as a movie subject."
" A deep portrait of a flawed, lonely, but enigmatic man.
",-0.1901,0.9969,2019-05-24 00:00:00,10,"As a kid, I was always enamored by Steve Jobs' larger-than-life personality. I have owned multiple versions of the iPod, and I couldn't be more wowed by his genius. That was until the Isaacson biography came out, and whatever I'd read of that book (which is an excellent unbiased piece on the man, although for some reason I couldn't complete it), I did recognize Jobs' flaws.After the disaster that was the Ashton Kutcher movie (although kudos to Kutcher for nailing the mannerisms), I really wanted this movie. I was hugely excited when I heard Fincher was in talks, and the Fincher-Sorkin duo has yielded an excellent result in the form of The Social Network. But the Sony hack said otherwise. Much later, when it was announced that Danny Boyle would take over (another director who's very accomplished in my opinion), I didn't think very highly of him as a director for this kind of movie.The movie was a lot of fictionalized dialogue and situational drama. But what the dialogue contained was surely true. Steve Jobs has created such an enigmatic image around himself, that nobody needed to see a movie of his greatness in my honest opinion. Which is why I loved the structure of this movie, and how it expressed those flaws, albeit in fictional situations. Fassbender was a great, great Jobs, even though he didn't nail the look of the younger Steve Jobs. Kate Winslet was evergreen, she is just, well, phenomenal. Rogen as Woz was also surprisingly a good turn by the otherwise goofy actor, and he nailed the Woz vibe. The dialogue was as Sorkin-y as it could get - rapid fast exchanges, solid retorts and burns, and ultimately a lot of closure.You see a Steve Jobs that started out as an immature person who said that 28% of American men could be his daughter's father. The gradual development of how he settled all of that was heartwarming to see. There's a lot of anguish in between, which is why it feels so good to see the movie end like that. He realizes that it isn't a binary, that he could be decent and gifted simultaneously. That's why I loved this movie. It made me have a little more respect for the flawed Jobs that I knew. Of course, a Fincher version might have been better, but I'm not complaining. I thoroughly enjoyed what Boyle brought to the table. 9.5/10."

But computers and gadgets don't really matter here. The three occasions add up to give a subtle depth to the Steve Jobs in this movie. He grows up. He starts as an arrogant and despisable man. Toward the end he is as much arrogant but you see more complexity in his character.Acting is great. The dialogue is crisp and humorous. I never got bored watching this movie for two hours. Highly recommended, even if you have no interest in Steve Jobs or Apple, because this movie is all about human emotion, (maybe appropriately) centered around a psychopathic CEO."

The characters were played extraordinarilly with realistic dialogue i.e. everyone is intterupting eachother and not listening to what others have to say. The score was quite good, but the visual effects and cinematography were nothing special, goof, but not something I would want from a movie like this. The story was engaging and the time jumps didn't feel forced, the three acts were well defined and Jobs' character arc was extremely interesting to observe.

Here we are presented a man who goes into a funk the moment someone acts, thinks, or speaks their own truth. Thus, we are led to believe Jobs thinks he is god and cannot be crossed. Instead of creating light he has it extinguished, makes computers look like sharks and refuses to acknowledge the numerous slights and hurts he unnecessarily causes to all around him...oh, apart from his big funders. Similarly, this film casts no light on the man and his motives, trashes the reputations of bystanders and leaves you gnashing your teeth for having wasted your time and money."

For some reason a mass grouping of people think that famous individuals live their whole life infront of a camera. This movie is proof they do not.This movie has some really amazing star power behind it from Danny Boyle leading the helm as director to Michael Fassbender in the title role and actors like Kate Winslet and Seth Rogen in between. However, the star power in this movie is lost in the absolute magnitude of story this film provides for you. Not once in this movie did I find myself watching as Steve argued his way through life and thought to myself ""Man, Micheal just doesn't look right."" Or ""This is an awesome movie."" Instead I found myself saying things to myself like ""I hope Steve and Woz don't end up ripping each other apart"" and ""Don't let go of Lisa, Steve"".There is absolutely no denying the huge shadow that Steve Jobs left on the world. If you approached 200 people just randomly on the streets and asked if they knew Steve Jobs, they would say yes 99% of the time. Everyone knows Apple. Everyone knows the MacBook. Everyone knows the name ""Steve Jobs"". However, they don't know the true story. This is that story.On the technical side this movie knocks it out of the park. The sets are fantastic, The music is spot on, The lighting is perfect, The props are great, etc, etc, etc. Definitely check this film out if you haven't. Even if you aren't an Apple fan. This isn't the story of Apple. This is the story of Steve."

" Disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.9441,2018-07-24 00:00:00,5,"A biography of the famous computer genius (played by Michael Fassbeneder) is played out in three different segments in 1984, 1988, and 1998. All segments involve a product launch with all the backstage tension that precedes presentations before huge audiences.It is interesting that the screenwriter of this film, Aaron Sorkin, also wrote ""The Social Network"" (2011). Both films were about computer geniuses who had acted terribly toward other people.Both films had the difficulty of making computer science interesting to the many who know little or nothing about it. ""The Social Network"" succeeded in ways that ""Steve Jobs"" does not. Mind you, there is less technical jargon needed to describe an interactive website than to describe a series of computers. Still, ""The Social Network"" used computer jargon as background against the bigger drama of greed and betrayal. ""Steve Jobs"" is overloaded with technical jargon to the point that it becomes difficult to care.In one scene, Jobs confronts a former boss played by Jeff Daniels. Director Danny Boyle intercuts this scene with a flashback scene between the two that had involved a major conflict. The director and acting were great in this scene but it failed as the detail of their discussions were often difficult to follow.There are many moments when someone is accusing Steve of being a jerk. Even if they may be right, the accusers all seem to be jerks as well. Despite the good acting, it is hard to really like or sympathize with anyone in this film except Steve's biological daughter whose unstable mother frequently wants more money from him.The good team behind this film (which also includes Kate Winslet as Jobs' longtime colleague and friend) make it tempting to like the movie.

The whole film takes place indoors, except for a climatic scene of change and redemption that moves outdoors. This is the one directorial flourish in a film limited by its locations, and Sorkin's trademark need to have characters stand around barking eloquently at each other. The acting is very good, with Seth Rogan carrying particular appeal. The directing is straitjacketed in the limited locations. Sorkin's dialogue and characterisation, so finely done in The Social Network, does not stand up here. Everyone sounds like Sorkin, which one becomes weary of after a while. A different writer bringing more nuanced characterisation and idiosyncrasy to the dialogue might have served this project better."

" It Seems Pretty One Dimensional
",0.4939,0.9894,2018-06-23 00:00:00,4,"So, Steve Jobs is an ass. That's clearly well established in this movie called - somewhat unoriginally, but with precise definition, ""Steve Jobs."" I don't know if it's ever been proven to be true or not, but anecdotally at least, brilliant people are often socially inept at best, and do't do well with relationships. Jobs apparently managed to alienate almost everyone in his life - from his friends (most importantly Steve Wozniak, played by Seth Rogen) to his lover Chrisass Brennan (Katherine Waterston) to the daughter he spent years denying (played by different actresses at various ages) to pretty much anyone who ever worked for him or with him at Apple Computers. He wasn't a particularly nice guy. We spent two hours learning that - although there are quite a few people (including John Sculley, who became Apple CEO and is portrayed by Jeff Daniels) who argue that the portrayal of Jobs in the movie is unfair.My basic complaint with the movie is that Jobs did, indeed, come across as extremely one dimensional. It felt as if I was watching a caricature of the man rather than a serious biography. Michael Fassbender played him - and did well enough - but I didn't come away from the movie feeling as if I knew much more about Jobs than I did coming into it and, except possibly for Lisa as she grows up with a father who refuses to acknowledge that he is her father, I really didn't much care for anyone or about anything in the movie. There's some interesting material I guess about the growth of Apple and Jobs' other ventures leading up to his return to Apple and the ultimate reconciliation between Jobs and Lisa eventually gives you a bit of a heartwarming moment. But I really found this to be on the whole rather passionless and cold. (4/10)"

Not knowing pretty much about this great guy, Steve Jobs, might in a way help you enjoy this movie to tell you his life and story in a very remarkable way. Truly, it was a remarkable way to tell you Jobs' life by showing the audience what happened before his 3 famous speeches. No critic can deny that it was a new way to learn a well-known person. Of course, some might like the movie very much while others blamed the filmmakers for this terrible idea. This movie might be able to be turned into a play since one's life is a play .However, I guess few people (especially the Apple fans) would see it.Apart from this new way, the relationship between Steve and Lisa was also an attraction. In the movie, the chemistry worked to me. The movie showed how Steve changed his attitude towards her daughter (whether true or not). He began to like Lisa when he found out that she drew a picture on a Mac, which Jobs later told Lisa that he still remembered closing to the end of the movie. And Joanna Hoffman (played by Kate Winslet) in this movie was also a key to this relationship, who was truly a good helper to Jobs.Finally, although most of my friends actually don't use a Mac, I could still feel the hard working of Mr. Jobs' pushing himself to perform better upon his beautiful and sufficient products in this movie. There is no denying that such IT leaders' perseverance allowed most people in this world able to sit comfortably in front of a computer to type a movie review or just watch a movie called Steve Jobs."

We also meet his daughter Lisa and her mother (Katherine Waterston) along with the major characters at Apple. The next 40 minutes is a behind the scenes look at the roll out of the Cube, and again we get more character study of Steve (Michael Fassbender) and more flashbacks...and some more of Lisa. The rest of the film jumps to 1998 and behind the scenes look at roll out of I-MAC and more of Lisa.If you want a biography and a film most people can easily digest the Ashton Kutcher film is superior. This film has some aspects for the technology based audience as well as those who are curious about the unusual father-daughter relationship that Jobs maintained. Steve Jobs is portrayed as an intense individual who is a perfectionist, condescending and difficult to work with. I think I said that politely.This film won't have universal appeal but had great performances.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Steve Jobs: A Troubled Genius Of Silicon Valley
",-0.4588,0.9799,2018-05-17 00:00:00,8,"Genius is often a tough thing to define; and for the person that is frequently defined as a genius, it can lead to a feeling of invincibility, a feeling that you know more than anyone else, inherent insecurity, and indifference. A fair amount of that was very true of Steve Jobs, the co-founder, with Steve Wozniak, in 1976 of Apple, which over the ensuing two decades of turmoil and enormous growth became one of the biggest technological corporations on the planet. His death from a pancreatic tumor in the fall of 2011 at the shockingly early age of 56 led to a stream of films, documentary and feature alike. One of those was the 2015 opus STEVE JOBS.Based on Walter Isaacson's hugely successful biography that included a lot of interviews with the man, STEVE JOBS stars Michael Fassbender as the ""resident genius"" of the explosive Silicon Valley technological scene of the 1980s always busy dreaming up new technological marvels, and parsing off blame on others when things don't go according to his own version of Hoyle. Indeed, his reactions to his former colleagues, like Wozniak (Seth Rogan) and former Pepsi chairman John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), and even his own marketing executive Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), are ones of almost intolerable cruelty, including Daniels having axed Fassbender from Apple, and Rogan pointing out in graphic detail how much he, and not Fassbender, created the computers and operating systems that made Apple a technological giant in the first place. And then flesh-and-blood reality in the form of a former girlfriend of his (Katherine Waterston) and her daughter, intrude; and he Fassbender is eventually forced to confront the failures in his rise to the top that were caused by his cold obsession with ""changing the world"".Fassbender does not have an easy job in his portrayal of Jobs, largely because he has to get into the skin of the techno-genius, and that skin is clearly crawling with ego. Truth be told, Fassbender's portrayal really comes across as one of the bigger egomaniacal bastards seen on screen in recent times. This probably has a lot with the real Jobs having been so candid about himself with Isaacson in the book prior to his passing, though such a character, in what passes for today's Hollywood, can be seen as rather repellent. But that would seem to be what Steve Jobs himself was often like, especially during those times that the film focuses on, the roll-outs of new products of Jobs' own skewed creative mind that happened in 1984, 1988, and 1998. It also doesn't hurt that the direction of Danny Boyle (SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE; 28 DAYS LATER; 127 HOURS), and the screenplay adaptation of Isaacson's book by Aaron Sorkin (A FEW GOOD MEN; THE SOCIAL NETWORK) have both a marvelous technological sheen and a scathingly sardonic edge (peppered with a fair amount of profane bits of dialogue) to it.Nevertheless, despite (or maybe because of) the realistic, if frequently unsympathetic, portrayal of Jobs by Fassbender, along with Winslet's, Daniels', and Rogan's performances, the film is a very direct look at how being a ""genius"" with an outsized ego to match can do funny things to those who have both. STEVE JOBS, as such, is worthy of a '9' rating from me."
" Great Scriptwriter + Great Director + Awesome Acting = Poor Film
",0.8807,0.9295,2018-05-10 00:00:00,6,"Steve Jobs is a biographical film with a unique narrative. It showcases 3 moments of Jobs life. The Macintosh launch, the Next black cube launch and the imac launch. At each launch he interacts with 5 key characters. His partner in crime the genius Steve Wozniak, his work wife Joahanna Hoffman, his Father figure / Apple CEO John Sculley, his technician Andy (dont know which one) and his daughter Lisa. While this narrative is able to showcase the trials and tribulations of his personal and professional life, it also reduces his life to 15 conversations which most probably did not really happen. Some of these are really hard to care about particularly if you are not a Steve jobs or Apple fan. While the acting by each actor is brilliant particularly Seth Rogen (maybe a career best and the only scenes worth remembering) and Kate Winslet (amazing as always), there are some conversations where I found myself laughing at the seriousness at which they were taken. Such as John sculley and jobs arguing about whether they should have put in the hard disk in a computer or not. I mean seriously who cares. The narrative also handicaps Danny Boyle's trade mark style of quick action punctuated by an awesome OST and background. 
Its as if the entire weight of the film rests on the chemistry, the dialogue of those 15 conversations which are well as I said nothing really exciting. This film is a perfect example of how bringing the best in the business may not be enough to create magic. Arguably the best screenplay writer in Hollywood, an Oscar winning director and a stellar cast about an ultra dramatic real life genius of our times still cannot make a great movie. If you want to catch the making of a tech giant. Might as well re-watch The Social Network (ironically a superb script by the same Aaron Sorkin) also showcasing a rude, egoistical, selfish genius of our times. Final recommendation : Skip this iBore and watch this only good scene of the movie KR PS On a personal note, I have never understood the charm of the apple products. I have always found them too much show and too little use. Further, they seem fuelled by blatant capitalism which makes people pay for things that can be got for cheaper and most probably not needed in life. But then that's my POV and i tried hard to not let it come in the way of the movie but maybe it did..."
" Great man and cast, good film
",0.7906,0.998,2018-04-21 00:00:00,7,"Steve Jobs was a fascinating, though complex, individual, so having a film based on him was always going to peek interest. Then there is the talent involved in 'Steve Jobs', director Danny Boyle who has made some very good films, one of today's most talented script-writers Aaron Sorkin and Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet as the leads.Found 'Steve Jobs' to be a good and interesting film, albeit not one that will appeal to all viewers as can be seen from the polarising reviews. There is a lot to like here, and the good points are actually excellent. At the same time, considering the involvement of such fine talent and subject matter, 'Steve Jobs' also had potential to be, and perhaps should have been, more than good, great even. There are also a few issues here, and fairly sizeable ones, though there is much more good than there is bad.There could have been more complexity to Jobs himself, difficult to do for a perfectionist who was very difficult to work with. Can definitely understand the criticism of 'Steve Jobs' being a pretty one-dimensional portrait of the man that magnifies his flaws. For something featuring heavily, his personal/family life could have been better explored and delved into more, there is heart with the relationship between Steve and Lisa but the final fifteen minutes or so to me came over as contrived rather than emotional and although Katherine Waterston does a good job her role is underwritten.At times, the film is jumpy and also could have shown more of the launches themselves and showed how they were received rather than being told afterwards, for a film so heavily reliant on the backstage/behind the scenes aspects. Actually really liked the script on the most part, it is though talk-heavy and with scenes having a lot to take in there are instances where it's not easy keeping up. Also didn't buy Jobs/Scully's final scene together, which went against what was seen with their acrimonious confrontations before. However, 'Steve Jobs' is very well made visually. It's unfussy but never cheap, actually it is very slick. It may feel like a filmed play, which is also down to the structure of the film, but for me it wasn't a problem. Boyle directs in a restrained fashion, while showing plenty of engagement with his material. The music is both low-key and lively when used.While not perfect, Sorkin's script is one of the high points of 'Steve Jobs'. It's thought-provoking, intriguing smart and rapid-fire, with plenty of wit, intensity and snappy put-downs. The story, following an unconventional yet fascinating three act structure dealing with three different launches that Jobs revolutionised, goes at an energetic pace and is kept afloat by the intensity of the characters (especially Jobs and Joanna). Things move quickly and there is plenty to be interested by, one just can't help feeling that some aspects could have been delved into more. Jobs and Joanna have plenty of intensity in their chemistry, while Woz's final scene and the big scenes between Jobs and Scully are especially powerful. Other than Sorkin's script, 'Steve Jobs' best asset is the acting. Fassbender may not look like Steve Jobs but he is nonetheless terrific and is an incredibly compelling presence. Winslet's performance is tense and deeply felt. Michael Stuhlbarg steals scenes in his not large screen time, while Seth Rogan demonstrates why he should do more dramatic roles and films and Jeff Daniels has not been this good in quite some time. Waterston does well with limited screen time and her role underwritten.Concluding, good film but not a great one. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
" the man behind the Mac
",0.0,-0.5093,2018-04-20 00:00:00,8,"Every techie knows who Steve Jobs was. That is, they know that he founded Apple Inc., revolutionizing computers. But most people probably don't know Steve Jobs the man. Danny Boyle's Academy Award-nominated 2015 movie ""Steve Jobs"" is based on Walter Isaacson's biography of the Apple founder. Jobs had authorized the bio, but Isaacson's condition was to get the final say (in that he didn't give the most flattering image of Jobs). It got published right after Jobs's death on 2011.The movie focuses on three major events in Jobs's life: the release of the Macintosh in 1984, the launch of NeXT in 1988, and the unveiling of the iMac in 1998. Accompanying each of these is the issue of Jobs's refusal to provide for an old flame who claims that he's the father of her daughter. In these scenes, he comes across as kind of a nasty person. It was ironic that I watched all this on a MacBook Air.The movie emphasizes these events and relationships; there's no depiction of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak coming up with the idea for the computer in their garage. I guess that the point is that every icon is bound to have a less-than-venerable side. But seriously, are you gonna get people in this day and age to give up their iPhones just because Steve Jobs wasn't the nicest guy?It was through watching this movie that I learned about most of the other people who were involved in launching the products. I'd heard of Jobs and Wozniak. Joanna Hoffman, Andy Hertzfeld, John Sculley and Andrea Cunningham were new to me. Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Michael Stuhlbarg and Jeff Daniels turned in outstanding performances, as expected. It was surprising to see Seth Rogen in a serious role for a change, since we're used to seeing him play stoners who talk about bodily functions. But he gives it his all here.In the end, I recommend the movie."

Boyle's film here, whose only (relative) defect is to be released after, is infinitely superior at all levels.Cinephiles, comedians known or not, go see it. This is a real movie of comedians. It takes place in 3 acts, each shot on 3 different media: 16 mm film, 35 mm film and digital. During the shooting, before each act the actors repeated for 1 week and then turned the act, stop, repetition and so on. Filmed in 3 different theaters, still indoors, it revolves around the two main characters (Jobs and its marketing director). Splendid work (we will say ""as usual"") of Fassbender and Winslet, and all the supporting roles.The film keeps us in suspense for 2 hours at the sole strength of the actors and the quality of the dialogues fairly dense. A little technical but not that much.
It's not a movie about the Mac. It shows (in each of the acts) Jobs before each product launch, you know those technological masses that made Apple-addicts vibrate. Each act ends when Jobs enters the scene.It shows the story of the successes and failures of Jobs, its conflicts with its employees, its partners (Wozniak) and its bosses. And especially paternity with his daughter, he refuses to recognize at first. It is in this relationship that is difficult to weave which emerges the humanity of the film, which could have been a long blah-blah without soul. Failure avoided brilliantly because the narration is dynamic. Included in the text but without the context of the adventure Apple.
The music is discreet, it is limited to regular and repetitive layers, never too present. It is only there to insinuate a subtle but effective tension when it is necessary. The characters are complex, human, diverse. Nothing manichean here.Facing film, we can draw parallels with ""The Social Network"" David Fincher, the story of Facebook. Shiny film too but here Boyle offers us more sensitivity to humans, to what he lives. The relationship between Jobs and her daughter is as touching as possible, because it develops despite the rough personality of Jobs, and flourishes only at the end, without artifice, without violins, without big accolades, without tears. And it's all the more moving."

Seth Rogen is surprisingly decent as Steve Wozniak while the great Michael Stuhlbarg steals all of his scenes as usual.

This movie may not be as slick and cool as the social network, however it still remains an excellent biopic. The key reason why this film wasn't a box office success lies in mixed critic reception.

Walter Isaacson's authorized biography of Steve Jobs is a favorite of mine and the movie is pretty good, but no where near as detailed.The movie is not really 'Steve Jobs'; he was so much more than the asshole portrayed in the movie. Yes, true (as Isaacson's bluntly objective book confirms) Jobs was a massive jerk; a sometimes mean, vicious, sarcastic person who believed he was God's gift to computers, and a ruthless businessman. He wasn't a code-writer or an engineer. He was a visionary. He knew what we wanted before we wanted it. His mind was years ahead of technology. Kurt Cobain changed the face of music; Steve Jobs changed the face of computing forever (I don't own a single iThing) and he did it his way.Writer Sorkin did an excellent job adapting Isaacson's book for the screen, doing it in three acts that coincide with three of Jobs' biggest business 'accomplishments': The introduction of the Macintosh (1984), NeXT (1988), and the iMac (1998). (The NeXT was a disaster. A $13,000 - in today's dollars - perfectly square useless brick. But, fun-fact, the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, used a NeXTcube to run the world's first webserver!). There was so much to Jobs' life and so many more people in his life detailed in the book, that it must have been a difficult adaptation for Sorkin. However, the point was taken – Jobs was a brilliant, albeit flawed person.It's fun to watch the movie, and it's faced-paced so you won't be looking for the 'NeXT' scene button. Take it for what it is, a subjective portrait."

This movie is about 5 stars and that from 2013 is about 7 stars.There are some weaknesses also in this movie compared to the older movie. Aston Kutcher is brilliant as Steve Jobs, Michael Fassbender does a really great job in acting as the psychopathic Steve but appearance is really not in line, so one gets confused when seeing this movie, and i did not relate to Steve Jobs at all seeing Fassbender in this role.The acting from Kate Winslet is also exaggerated at times (acting 3,5/10) and makes the situation untrustworthy for a movie.I would not advice people to see this in a cinema."

Does everything really have to be such a battle of wits, personalities, and egos? Seems to be so in this film. Also, I must say that Jobs came off as profoundly narcissistic, so much more so than I had anticipated. Not sure if this is true to the actual Steve Jobs, but if so, I must say I lost a lot of respect for Steve Jobs after having seen this movie. Surprises me that he is hero-worshiped by so many, if indeed he has such a selfish and narrow-minded personality. That said, the acting by Michael Fassbender is excellent, as is Kate Winslet as his assistant, and just a generally fine job by the whole cast.

Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.Kate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.Jeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.As for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.So don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly. And regardless of what others say, I think it gives the most humane portrayal of Jobs I've seen on film. Strongly recommended."
" Like watching a VERY LONG trailer
",0.3612,0.9674,2017-06-12 00:00:00,3,"The execution is impressive, but impressive does not equal a good movie in this case. The screenplay is on one hand creative in the way it approaches the story, but on the other hand very much made of a line of superficial clichés. I would expect deeper research from someone doing a biographical movie. The way Jobs is depicted, the absolute lacking of his family (that was a very important part of his life), the genius-bastard stereotype, the never changing character - all this is very boring, if not exhausting. The entire movie is hectic, like a very very long trailer, and at a certain point you understand that this is not going to change until the end, and it doesn't."
" This movie doesn't represent Steve Jobs much!
",0.0,-0.8666,2017-06-04 00:00:00,1,"This movie fails to show the life of Steve Jobs. Also The actor who represent Steve Jobs, Michael Fassbender did not do very well. He doesn't look like Steve Jobs at all. The movie shows a very little portion of Steve Jobs's life whereas his life was more complex and full of different stories. I would say the movie ""Jobs"" released in 2013 was able to portray the actual life of Steve Jobs. The actor of that movie Ashton Kutcher looks almost like Steve Jobs. So I would not recommend this movie ""Steve Jobs"". I'm sorry."
" Captivating performance
",0.0,0.9581,2017-04-30 00:00:00,8,"I was hooked almost as soon as the movie began, and I followed the flow of Sorkin's dialogue all the way till the end. The movie could have easily lasted for an hour more and follow Jobs through the rest of his career. But I'm sure it would be harder to keep it thematically together, at least the parts of the story that they chose to focus on.I've never been all that interested in Jobs, but I was completely captivated by Fassbender's performance here. But to me, he did not feel much like Steve Jobs, but rather a (brilliant) character that uses the narrative of the historical person ""Jobs"" as means to unfold himself. In a way, it was odd to see this movie made about people who are mostly alive (or recently deceased) because it feels more like characters in a play than it does any sort of biopic. (But as I'm writing this, I'm wondering if this is something I truly felt, or only expected to feel due to the reputation of the movie and Sorkin's writing.) But even though I found the movie enjoyable from beginning to end, there's not many big moments in it that'll stick with me. I can imagine it being very rewatchable, but not all that memorable."
" A fascinating character study
",0.5423,0.989,2017-04-19 00:00:00,8,"Fassbender is magnificent in the title role, and the decision to advance the plot through a series of keynote addresses, which is truly what Jobs is best known for, was brilliant. The movie is a bit thin, and overly dramatic, but it isn't meant to be a historical documentary, and overall the quick pace and liberties taken with historical events allow it to present the story, which is true if not in factual basis, is true in spirit. The story entertains by virtue of packing its highlights within the neat bookends of a bookmark address."
" How or why did Woz actually endorse this?
",0.3182,0.9714,2017-03-24 00:00:00,6,"I'm not a blinkered Steve Jobs fanboy by any means, but this movie was such a one-dimensional character portrayal, it was to the extreme. We all know Jobs, especially the '75-85 Jobs was a petulant, cold, arrogant and notoriously difficult personality to work with. All of the nasty traits and stories were true, but he was a far more complex and multi dimensional personality than the sad, tired, one sided version that this movie perpetuates.Fassbender does his best, he's a great actor, but sorry, he is horribly miss cast as Jobs, at no point did I believed him to be Steve Jobs for a second. There was not the look, style, mannerisms, speech, charm or charisma of Jobs. None of the inspiring leader, the innovative visionary that he most certainly was, nothing. The movie makers attempted to reveal more of the man behind the brand, a journey into his inner mind, his psyche, but instead we got a thoroughly repulsive, unlikable, sociopathic monster, who was apparently that 24/7...not to say he wasn't any of these at some point in time, but some perspective would have been more realistic. This movie would have been better suited as an overly dramatic stage play.The equally great genius, Woz is sadly reduced to a geeky, weak, vision-less, accidental side kick, who's held at arms length. And to say in the movie that Jobs never respected Woz, and that he was 'just' an engineer? Absolute rubbish. Talk about fiction. Although small, another reference that's way off is Jobs saying to Lisa that the Sony Walkman is an ugly, useless brick. Jobs was literally OBSESSED with Sony and especially the Walkman, he had the highest respect and famously studied them to try and understand what made them great. Like the way he approached all of his products, movies made about him should be about getting the little details right.Apparently this was based upon the biography of Jobs by Walter Isaacson, which is a very creative and highly dubious claim. I have read the book, and although far from perfect, and certainly not a documentary, Kutcher's portrayal of Jobs and his movie is a far better rendition of it. Factual inaccuracies riddle both movies, but I enjoyed the other 'Jobs' much more. It was more inline with 'Pirates of Silicon Valley' which Jobs and Woz both claimed were closest to the each of them and their story.I get they were going for a 'deeper' insight into Steve Jobs character, but a more rounded, less one-dimensional rendition of the man, his impact and his very flawed genius would have been a better approach."
" The biopic that is a character study.
",0.0,0.9953,2017-03-19 00:00:00,10,"I am a big fan of Aaron Sorkin's work. I have re-watched most of his work, including the Academy Award winning ""The Social Network"", and the courtroom drama ""A Few Good Men"", and his TV shows ""The West Wing"", ""Studio 60"" and also ""The Newsroom"". All his movies have dialogue which feels organic, natural, and sing-song. And when I heard he would be writing the new Steve Jobs movie, and that it was to be directed by Danny Boyle, I was eagerly waiting for its release. And boy! My expectations were blown away! REMEMBER!! THIS MOVIE IS NOT A BIOPIC!! IT IS A CHARACTER STUDY!!! Everything about this movie is perfect. The casting, the performances, the set design, the background music and the dialogue, all are EXCEPTIONAL. The movie follows a three-act format, each set before the launch of an important product. Unlike the earlier Steve Jobs movie ""Jobs"" (which is a blow-by-blow biopic of the great man), this movie is a more intricate tale of how the man was. In a day and age where a biopic just gives you details of what happened in the subject's life, this movie comes off as a breath of fresh air. Whichever interaction one takes, whether it be between Jobs and Joanna Hoffmann, or Jobs and Lisa (his daughter), or Jobs and Wozniak, or Jobs and John Sculley, all give an in-depth look into Steve Jobs' life. But for me personally, the conversation between Jobs and John Sculley, in the one hour mark is probably one of the greatest ever sequence of dialogue I have ever seen. That scene shows the incredible talent of Aaron Sorkin, the editor Elliot Graham, the music composer Daniel Pemberton, the cinematographer Alwin H. Küchler, the director Danny Boyle and Michael Fassbender, Jeff Daniels and Kate Winslet. The performances from everyone is top-notch. As mentioned earlier, Michael Fassbender is magnificent, Kate Winslet slips into the role of Joanna Hoffman effortlessly, Seth Rogen is brilliant as Steve Wozniak, the three actresses who portrayed Lisa Brennan Jobs, were brilliant!! Amazing movie!! A perfect score!!"
" One of the WORST films I've seen!
",-0.729,-0.4767,2017-03-02 00:00:00,3,"I can't believe the same screenwriter wrote ""The Social Network."" This Film was terrible. They could have just given him a mic and let him repeat, ""She's not my daughter,"" a thousand times. There was little depth to this movie. Such a complicated, inventive man, and such a shallow movie. Tsk tsk tsk."
" As Aaron Sorkin As It Gets--For Better Or Worse
",-0.0516,0.9854,2017-02-27 00:00:00,10,"Inherently, I know that ""Steve Jobs"" isn't a 10-star film if being completely objective. It fails to capture the visual aura of the titular subject himself, and it loses focus in the final moments. Yet, the storytelling prowess and style of writer Aaron Sorkin is exactly what I look for in a film. As such, I'm able to overlook some of the faults here and give it a top rating for the many things it does right.For a very basic overview, ""Steve Jobs"" tells the story of the legendary Apple founder himself (played by Michael Fassbender) through three different product launches at three distinct times in his life. In each instance, Jobs verbally spars with personal assistant Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) and must deal with a child (Makenzie Moss, Ripley Sobo, & Perla Haney-Jardine) who he doesn't want to accept is his and an estranged wife (Katherine Waterston) who wants little to do with him other than his bank deposits. Also explored are Jobs' relationships with fellow tech gurus Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogan), John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), and Andy Hertzfield (Michael Stuhlbarg).As we all know, the real-life Steve Jobs was a very complicated, unique, and even polarizing figure (this was a man once forced out of the company he created). He was a revolutionary thinker...yet pretty much everyone who worked for him intimates that he was a class-A jerk with a slave-driver mentality. All of that is captured here in the trademark Sorkin snappy-dialogue, walk-and-talk style. There are three things that ""Steve Jobs"" truly excels at:-Providing a compelling history of Jobs' involvement with Apple (sort of a history of the early computer business).
-Giving viewers a glimpse into the mind of a perfectionist who seemingly cares more for design and production than feelings or sentiment.
-Musing upon the notion of whether or not an individual has to be a jerk in order to run a successful, world-changing company.Sorkin--and director Danny Boyle--combine to expertly explore those themes in dramatic and thought-provoking ways. This is very much a ""talking film"", as per Sorkin, so if you are looking for a lot of action, you might have to temper expectations. Fortunately, Sorkin is a dialogue master. There isn't a wasted scene, with every conversation a chance to probe further into a nuance of Jobs' character as a business man, family man, or individual.To pull off all that gab, great actors are needed, and ""Steve Jobs"" has that. Fassbender is entrancing--if not visually accurate-- as Jobs, while Rogan's Woz steals the show a few times. Winslet's role is a bit undefined, but she's so talented it hardly matters.Overall, your own enjoyment of ""Steve Jobs"" will likely be determined by how much you appreciate the Sorkin filmmaking style. Like I said, it isn't a perfect film. But if what it excels at you enjoy, you'll be hard pressed not to love it, as it leans into those successes unabashedly."
" How to make what should be of interest a complete bore of a film.
",0.25,-0.674,2017-02-23 00:00:00,6,"We all know what an Apple is, and a little about the Apple corporation.When my wife and myself hired the film to enjoy on pay per view, we fell asleep. I urge every viewer of this production to throw rotten fruit, vegetables, and the kitchen sink at the makers of this film. The viewer might as well research on Google for information on Steve Jobs, and if he were alive he might suggest that the makers apply for a job in film making. What a disappointment this piece of work was, and by the end you could not care less, about any of the characters. This was not entertaining fare, and don't pay for the journey, unless you hire a sleeping berth."
" Showmanship
",0.0,0.5478,2017-02-22 00:00:00,6,"Less a biopic of the computing pioneer and more of a series of snapshots, this Aaron Sorkin scripted film focuses on the title character's anxieties in the minutes leading up to new product launches at three stages of his life. This is an interesting move by Sorkin and director Danny Boyle as we only get to see Jobs when at his most vulnerable, but the effectiveness is debatable. The film is flooded with flashbacks to provide exposition and fill in key details and tension inevitably dissipates with so much cutting back and forth. Sorkin also struggles to get under the title character's skin to reveal a human being. In the title role, Michael Fassbender is cold and distant throughout, proudly stating ""I'm indifferent to whether they dislike me"" and cynically commenting that people always ""find a reason to sue me"" when asked about contacting his birth father. On this note, the film tries to use the fact that Jobs was adopted as a possible reason for him being so callous but to little effect. His relationship with his estranged daughter is the only really element that humanises him, and even that never quite clicks with their bonding lost in the jumps in time between the three acts. And yet, there remains a lot to like about how the film captures his enthusiasm and showmanship, ruing the fact that movies like '2001' made the public fear computers and practising his product launches time and time again. Daniel Pemberton's pulsating music score is pitch perfect too and it is easy to see why Kate Winslet garnered awards attention, even if her authentic Polish accent sometimes slips."
" We will know soon enough if you are Leonardo da Vinci or just think you are.
",0.0,0.9287,2017-02-12 00:00:00,8,"The best part of Danny Boyle's biopic is the whip smart dialogue one would already expect from screenplay maestro Aaron Sorkin and the solid performances from Michael Fassbender, Seth Rogen, Kate Winslet and Jeff Daniels. This is strongly supported by a fantastic musical soundtrack from Daniel Pemberton. Where the film falls down (in my opinion), is in its structure. It has 3 segments: 1984 with the first release of the Mac, 1986 after the controversial firing of Jobs from his own company and his release of the NEXT computer and culminates in 1997 with his rise back to the top and release of the new IMac. Overall, The film didn't truly cover any new ground and left me still wanting to know so much more about what made the man tick. An entertaining and well made film for sure just not the masterpiece it could have been."
" Ambitious concept is creative and compelling, but ""Steve Jobs"" misses on emotion
",0.2732,0.9939,2017-02-01 00:00:00,7,"One of most successful and enigmatic tech minds and CEOs of the 20th century, the prospect of a film that could tear down the façade and present a compelling examination of Steve Jobs is pretty thrilling. Assigning that story to the only household name in screen writing, Aaron Sorkin, with Oscar winner Danny Boyle directing and one of today's most revered actors (Michael Fassbender) in the title role, the prospects turned out to be even juicier.Yet ""Steve Jobs,"" despite its dynamite acting and dramatic intensity, gets noticeably hampered by its own ambition. Sorkin endeavors to paint a complete and complex portrait of Jobs in a tidy three-act structure, with each act taking place in the hours and minutes leading up to three huge product launches: the Macintosh in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988 and the iMac in 1998. On the precipice of believing he's about to change the world with each announcement, we come to know Jobs through a series of backstage interactions with colleagues past and present and also his daughter and her mother (Katherine Waterston).This setup creates certain confines of time and space that serve as an echo chamber for the acting and Sorkin's dialogue, including his infamous ""walk and talks"" from his ""West Wing"" days. Although this amplifies the script, which is obviously positioned as the centerpiece of the film, it doesn't give Boyle any room to work with and begs the question of whether ""Steve Jobs"" would be better suited as a play.Plays need great dialogue, great acting and great ideas and ""Steve Jobs"" has all of it. Even the supporting characters with whom Jobs interacts in each act conveniently remain the same: marketing chief and closest confidant Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), old friend and Apple co-creator Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen), chairman of the board John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), Apple computer scientist Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) and Jobs' daughter, Lisa Brennan, played by three different actors. Each has different points of tension with Jobs and seem to have a a habit of confronting him in these moments.These numerous interactions provide insight into Jobs' disastrous interpersonal skills, especially the moments with his daughter in which he seems incapable of wearing the mantle of parent. Fassbender is particularly good at portraying Jobs' apparent lack of empathy especially toward Lisa, whom he views as a market test for how the next generation will use or want to use personal technology.On the other hand, Sorkin aims to depict Jobs as a visionary with a firm grasp on how people think, and how he let nothing stand in the way of forward momentum. One of the best examples comes early on when Jobs is insistent that the Mac says ""hello"" during the launch demonstration. His complicated friendship with Woz also brings this to the forefront; Woz insists that Steve give kudos to the team that developed the Apple II, which put them all on the map in 1977, yet Steve refuses him on principle. His never-look-back mentality was part of his genius and his flaws.These verbal back-and-forths can venture into esoteric territory. We don't see or experience any of the development or creative process behind any of these three products, just talking heads dropping expository clues as they argue. This kind of limits the scope with which we can observe Jobs. We can only really watch how he treats people, because he's almost exclusively talking. We don't get to see him in action, which would more effectively stretch the palette of colors available to Fassbender and Boyle to paint Jobs' persona. This particularly harms the emotional appeal of the character and therefore the film. It's intellectually satisfying, but lacking in pathos. Such is Sorkin's bane at times.""Steve Jobs"" has the magnetism that a biopic of Steve Jobs should possess. That largely comes from skilled actors wielding Sorkin's sharp dialogue, which despite having its own drawbacks is fitting of a film about an entrepreneur who always found a way to rise, like cream, to the top. The film, on the other hand, doesn't quite rise to the top of creative biopics, though certainly not for lack of trying.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
