" Really bad
",-0.5849,-0.984,2021-03-22 00:00:00,1,"I was into the movie until the killer showed up - what a disaster. He promises to terrify the main hero and torment her until she wants to die, but then does one creepy thing and proceeds to spend the rest of the movie walking around the house.One scene, which particularly pissed me off was when the killer was fighting her friends boyfriend and boyfriend took the guy down and almost choked him out and she just watched and did nothing, she could have ran out there and stabbed the guy or helped her friend in some other way, but she just ran back into the house - what an unlikable characters.I actually was happy, when she was fake killed, thinking that movie might stand a chance, but alas - it was just a bait and switch.Would not recommend to anyone."
" Not much to see, really.
",0.0,-0.628,2021-03-17 00:00:00,5,"It's just yet another horror movie about a killer trying to murder some woman in her house. There are some unique elements that this movie has that keep this from being a complete waste of time, but not nearly enough to make this a worthwhile movie."
" Underrated
",0.0,0.6588,2021-03-13 00:00:00,7,Great for a Netflix film ! Full of suspense and edge of the seat stuff. Give it a go .
" Great thriller
",0.6705,-0.9612,2021-03-11 00:00:00,9,"The way the director built tension and suspense is amazing. It was tense from the beginning till end.
I don't find the character's reaction illogical but on the other hand very human and typical of a normal person who never foresees any possibility of being killed by a serial killer. The reason why the killer was only banging on the windows isn't because he was stupid but he was toying with his victim.
One of the most interesting thrillers that sustain my attention recently."
" Silly
",0.0258,-0.936,2021-03-03 00:00:00,1,"Suspense in the night is a good idea. But unfortunately many scenes looked like black-and-white movies from the thirties.
No logic: how did the masked man get in the house in the beginning? Windows and doors were closed and no glass was broken. After that he suddenly could not enter the house again. Tapping on the windows and doors did not help. Of course. And then a cold blooded killler appeared not tot be able to break any glass window or door. Afraid of alarming the neighbours? The victim lives far away from everybody..."

" Too many predictable cliches
",0.0,-0.9952,2021-02-21 00:00:00,2,"Good intentions and potential for a thriller/horror but failing short due to every predictable Hollywood cliche. The movie starts with little to no introduction into the characters and their background. Why has this deaf lady moved alone into the woods at all? What's her story? What's up with the sudden neighbor at her doorstep? The bad guy drops also from nowhere - starts killing people for what reasons? For fun? For money? For organ donation? The whole fight between the victim and the intruder contains absolutely every stupid predictable cliche you would expect from Hollywood: the victim trying to run multiple times in the dumbest, most dangerous way possible, only to get hurt/caught, she taking multiple shots at the enemy but (of course) always failing short to actually hurt/kill him... Then the good Samaritan neighbor who ALMOST manages to save her but - of course- she distracts him in the worst possible moment causing him only to get killed so she is again on her own.... and then the final fight dragged out where each one of them gets hurt like 100 times yet no one dies until she almost - with her last heartbeat - manages somehow to knock him dead?! Come on, your audience deserves better! Main actress did a good job but all these absolutely foreseeable, same old cliches killed it for me. Predictable and boring."
" Very nice, watch it.
",0.4754,0.9202,2021-02-21 00:00:00,7,"One of the best low budgeted movies. In these kinds of movies generally characters are stupid af which makes us hate it. But in this movie, everybody is smart and script is very good. I loved it."
" I sure regretted watching this
",-0.0772,-0.8309,2021-02-13 00:00:00,1,"Watching this movie made me write this review. It is hard to write something without using foul language. Everything was absolutely terrible starting from the cast, dynamics of the movie, the plot...just awful. The main character lakes any kind of judgment, logics, elementary reasoning. The villain on the other hand seems to have some sort of supernatural powers as he seems to be unaffected by any of the serious wounds that strike him during the movie. It was cliched, with elements of Halloween and Scream, but much more poorly done.
Avoid at all costs!"

" Wtf man, why so many negative reviews?
",-0.8307,-0.9523,2021-02-09 00:00:00,8,"After watching the movie (which I found very interesting btw)
I went to read some reviews of the film here on IMDB, and what I saw was a flood of negative criticisms defaming the film, most talking about the stupid decisions made by the characters, something I completely disagree with, I think the decisions made by the characters are very smart ( given the circumstances).
I like the fact that the protagonist is deaf (I just think the direction should use it more in favor of the antagonist ), I also liked the serial killer to be just a serial killer, who kills because yes, and that's it.
Not everything needs to have a reason and the serial killers are proof of that, the film does not need to justify its actions, even because it is a SERIAL KILLER isn't it self-explanatory enough?The film is tension from beginning to end !!
Getting the viewer very involved with the plot and the characters, even with the serial killer, oddly enough.I like how the director show the house and its rooms in an organic way, subtly showing the places where the killer can enter, and the places where the victim can hide.I think the only thing I disliked about the film was the direction, even though Director Mike Flanagan is competent most of the time, I think he left something to be desired in TERROR. Even though the atmosphere at the beginning of the film is quite TERROR, in the course of the film, terror becomes much more secondary than anything else, with the direction focusing much more on the cat and mouse chase of the murderer and the victim (something interested enough).
Even though I missed that requirement a little, I ended up liking it anyway, with the facts unfolding, I was very fixed in the film. I just think that the direction missed an opportunity to make an excellent horror / chase movie, to focus more on an action and drama Thriller.
I think there was a lack of boldness in the direction in some aspects, but overall it is a great film.

" AUTOMATIC YES!
",0.4574,0.872,2021-01-25 00:00:00,10,"Ok. I see a lot of under 7 star reviews and it's quite disappointing. I've seen this movie only once and no most parts you can't predict what's going to happen. This movie is unpredictable, amazing, dark, and violent. The director has surpassed what I expected from this movie. A great cast, plot, silent for most parts which make me want to listen and look closely at what is coming my way. This had me on the edge of my seat because it amazed me at the unexpected turns. Hands down one of my favorite horror films alongside ""Hereditary"" ""The Ritual"" ""The Lodge"" ""Sinister"" All these films are a 10/10 and I recommend this movie to all. Wow!"
" Silly and not even scary
",0.4075,-0.8757,2021-01-23 00:00:00,3,I only lasted half way through. The situation was very improbable. The bad guy's actions seemed silly. How would you break into a glass house? Tap on the window a lot to intimidate the deaf person inside? The heroine's actions seemed silly: Madman outside. Go outside? And it was boring. (Can you set off a car alarm using the key remote? I can't.)
" Terrifying

This movie is terrifying. It will keep you at the edge of your seats. The movie has a good storyline and directing. The husband wife duo, Mike Flanagan and Kate Siegel are very good at horror thriller genre.
I found this movie somewhat of the same taste as ""Don't Breathe"".
A worthy watch."
" All of these Americans who DON'T own guns............

A woman who is deaf/mute and lives alone is the ultimate candidate for gun ownership but no that is not the way this movie proceeds......but then again a film that is 90 minutes would only be 20 if that were the case.

" Reinventing the American horror of the '80s
",-0.5719,-0.8635,2021-01-02 00:00:00,8,"For a long time since horror movies about serial killers that characterized the '80s, were out of circulation, understigated by a much more gore-style hostel-style genre
This film gives such films a second chance about, hunter-prey, which they liked so much in those years.
Relying on a more psychological and well-thought-out terror, a game that the killer decides to play.
The film tries to eliminate the clich√©s of the genre and does it in a great way, here the killer is also vulnerable, and the prey are not the typical heroines.
Good movie to revive the genre."

" When it hits, it hits hard.
",-0.1027,-0.8661,2020-12-02 00:00:00,7,"I was pretty excited going into this movie after having seen Haunting of Hill house so I had some high hopes. Luckily that didn't disappoint, even though this is quite a simple movie it is very enjoyable.Now starting off this movie is about the mute+deaf person being attacked by a serial killer. So the premise is interesting for sure and I'd love to see another movie on this but with a bit more character depth. For me, there was too little character development for the lead actress. You get to know some basic things, but it just didn't quite make it to really caring for that character. The movie could've used maybe just a few more minutes to shown maybe some more family interaction or history of the main characters so we really get a grip on that character and become engaged. This is probably my only major shortfall of the movie and it hits hard. There are some minor issues as well but most of the movie is good fun.So about the killer, I felt myself swinging between thinking he's an idiot or a smart guy. He mostly is smart, but mainly the way he has his mouth hanging open in the first half hour of the movie kinda set me off. I did like the fact he was smart, but not strong and solved those issues well. Later on he looked a lot better. Also he took off his mask pretty fast, imo it was a good design and could've been used for longer.The kills though, wow, they hit. There are only 3 kills in this movie (killer included) but they are lengthy, sickening and allround so much more interesting that another slasher kill. The movie also really needed this because it obviously barely has any. Both innocent kills both have an impact story wise and aren't senseless. The girlfriend being killed was the worst to stomach (pun intended) and whilst the boyfriend kill was great, the setup and ending struggle, to us the boyfriend was completely new to the story so I didn't care as much for his death. The gore is top notch, if there was cgi, I didn't notice it. So it's very good.There are a few parts that have had me a little bored, that was the section where the Maddie decides to first disinfect the wound instead of stopping the bleeding asap. To me this whole scene felt a bit unnecessarily drawn out. And a few drawn out scenes of the killer walking around the house. There were also a few creative decisions that I felt were missed opportunities with the whole mute+deaf concept. For instance the killer isn't messing around with Maddie all too much. I expected a little more of the moments where he stands behind directly her whilst she can't hear him. Like it lacked that kind of thrilling suspense.Another minor gripe or intended red herring was the Craig guy, which looked so setup, not for being the killer, but being the guy that saved her in the end. But after a few mentions it's never mentioned again nor does he show up.The soundtrack.. well there's barely any except for far till the finale, wasn't as good as I hoped. I did very much like the sound design, but the score they used didn't really play into that.7/10"
" Waste of time
",-0.4215,0.6486,2020-11-29 00:00:00,1,"In the preview the viewer sees a writer weighing options like in chess , forecasting moves & countermoves... anyway after an hour she finally has a minute and a half of thought and makes a choice.Choose wisely , skip this trash"
" What did I just see?
",0.0,0.5106,2020-11-26 00:00:00,1,Oh wait. The lead actress is also the writer (the only time Siegel has written at all) and the wife of the director/writer. Have fun connecting the dots.
" Still obsessed

Usually I get bored of shows after a couple seasons but this show is the exception. I love it, I love the drama and the emotion. One of few shows that manages to drag the emotion out of me. I think If I had to have a critique maybe a bit too much relationship drama but definitely won't keep me from watching it lol."
" Surprisingly good!

" A Respectable Thriller!
",0.5562,0.3157,2020-11-25 00:00:00,6,"""Hush"" is a textbook thriller abide by very basic stuffs but in convenient ways. Even with all the occasional sparks it ended up being just an above average. Perhaps an inexperienced writing endeavor is to be blamed.The story follows a Deaf & Mute writer, Maddie; who's on her own in a secluded place far away from the hustle bustle of a city. Living all by herself with frequent visits from her neighbours cum friends. One day, a cold-blooded killer decides to show up at her front door; starting off a hostile tussle between the Hunter & the Hunted. As a thriller, it's quite efficient in bringing up usual tropes. Although the narration being repetitive by nature, there's definitely ample amount of tension consistently riling up time to time.The strongest aspect here without any doubt are the performances. Kate Siegel the better half of Mr. Flanagan; is phenomenal in her role as Maddie. Such an indurated task to express a character's emotions without uttering a single word. Gallagher's portrayal as the antagonist was intimidating too.Talking about the technical parts, it's indeed well shot with majority of the scenes taking place at night-time. Which in itself a tough challenge to overcome. Soundscore is decent enough. Worked well with its overall ambience and the creepy undertones.Finally moving onto the negatives, They are not enough in numbers to have a discussion for. There's an obvious deficit of character backstories and salient pacing issues within the screenplay. Above all It's just the above average execution that personally bothered me. It doesn't showcase anything brilliant in particular. Just a respectable thriller that needed imperative sharpening around its edges!"
" Stupid movie full of plotholes
",-0.5267,-0.9795,2020-11-18 00:00:00,1,"**Spoilers**
I can't imagine why anyone would think this movie was any good. It's ridiculous with a story full of plot holes, in fact it has so many that you'll be left wondering where do you even begin.
The protagonist, Maddie, is deaf and mute and lives in the middle of nowhere. It's very unrealistic given anyone in that situation would know how dangerous it would be to be on their own in that kind of environment. Despite this she doesn't lock her doors, giving the killer a chance to sneak in and steal her phone. She also doesn't keep a gun, again highly unrealistic and absurd when you consider people buy guns in America like they're buying toys.
She doesn't keep a back up phone and her house is full of glass doors and windows making it ridiculously easy for anyone to break in.
The killer seems to be some sort of superhuman, his hand is impaled with a hammer, he gets shot with a crossbow bolt but none of that seems to have any effect on him. When John, Maddie's neighbour, shows up to her house searching for his girlfriend and see's the writing on the glass door he proceeds to act normally despite the fact his girlfriend is missing and there's something very suspicious about the writing on the door. When the psychopath confronts John pretending to be a cop, he easily believes him even when it's obvious that the guy pretending to be the cop looked very sketchy.
Then there's the scene towards the end where Maddie locks herself in a room ready to stab the killer and he sneaks in behind her through the window, again the scenes absolutely moronic. She has her back towards him and then like a scene straight out of a B grade Matrix movie she turns and stabs him just before he could stab her.
This movie is utterly stupid, save yourself the trouble and watch something better."
" Interesting, Nice concepts, But too short.
",0.4118,0.6455,2020-11-15 00:00:00,7,"It's not that poor, the idea concepts of the movie is really interesting but when the psycho take off his mask and doing anything it ruined it. and it's really too short because nothing lot to show. But anyway it's a great movie."
" This Woman Don't Need No Man
",0.2235,-0.0201,2020-11-15 00:00:00,9,"Craig is useless, just like most ex boyfriends. This plotline wasn't a fair fight though- did y'all know this lady is deaf? Also I didn't know fingers bent that way."
" SOLID.
",0.1531,0.5789,2020-11-14 00:00:00,8,"Solid home invasion flick. Flanagan is kind of an expert at building tension and making interesting stories with rich characters. It was a strange choice to unmask the killer soo early in, but it was a welcome twist."
" Annoying
",-0.4019,-0.9881,2020-11-10 00:00:00,5,"Movie wasn't bad but wasn''t good ether. First of all, who was the killer, why he killed. I really hated when, her friends boyfriends came and started to choke killer, but she was just standing there and watching.... Really? Just take the knife and stab him while u can.... Such a dumb choices..."
" It could've been better
",0.4404,0.1,2020-11-09 00:00:00,4,"They never explained why this guy was killing her. No connections, just wanted to murder everyone..? I'm so confused and wanted more questions answered. I get that sometimes things can be random but the way that the killer goes around and tries everything within his power to go and murder this random girl it just comes off that there's more to it why he's there. Maybe I missed something, but I really don't think so. I don't think it's a horrible movie but it would've been told better. The main character was a great pick and her acting was wonderful. Her story was told pretty well except that they don't really explain much with craig except that they just abruptly ended their relationship and he's calling her multiple times right before this guy comes and murders them. Makes you wonder if he sent him? Like I said so many unanswered questions. I would recommend watching it and then seeing what perspective you have on the movie but just with the way that it ended it was just over.. no more details added to the story. That's all folks."
" One of the most Intense movie with best acting
",0.6997,0.931,2020-11-02 00:00:00,9,"First of all this is not a Horror movie it's more of a Mystery thriller so do not misunderstand the genre.
They did a great job for creating suspense every time and movie do not bore you any minute it has suspense and acting of lead actress is top notch."

" Decent Idea Executed In The Worst Possible Way.
",-0.6249,-0.8672,2020-10-28 00:00:00,2,"Every character is undeveloped, every scene is ridiculous, every character is stupid as hell, and the ending is predictable. The idea of her being deaf and mute may sound like an idea to create a unique horror film, but the way it was executed suggests it was just an excuse to use the same horror cliches that are used over and over again, but to make them seem more ""realistic"" although they still fail at that. It fails because the writers could not put themselves into the shoes of any of the characters in the film. A deaf and mute character leaves the food she is cooking unattended to go talk to her neighbor outside even though her neighbor could of easily talked with her inside. If she is deaf and mute and has been for years, she knows that she will never hear a timer going off to inform her that the food is done cooking, so that is deaf and mute would NEVER do that. That is how the whole movie is written. Don't bother watching this trash. A 2/10 is generous."
" Average...
",0.0,-0.971,2020-10-27 00:00:00,5,"The plot is as thin as a piece of paper. It is basically one hour of cat an mouse with little to no surprises. But i guess that is expected when going into a movie like this.
But the fact that the villain is incredibly annoying and stupid at the same time doesn't help. He is as frightening as a muppet.
Also i learned from this movie that bleeding out is only a problem for the victim, not the perpetrator."
" Thrilling, claustrophobic domestic horror
",-0.1531,0.8583,2020-10-26 00:00:00,10,I really can't say I expected this to be a great horror film but it most definitely surpassed my expectations for it. A deaf writer in an isolated house in the woods being stalked by an unknown predator. I could feel the tension in the pit of my stomach watching this. The film takes a lot of unexpected turns and really does a great job at keeping you guessing up until a rather satisfying conclusion. Better than it has any right to be for a rather simple horror setting. Highly effective. A modern horror classic. Top marks.
" The girl must be a really bad writer
",-0.5849,0.5606,2020-10-25 00:00:00,6,"I was on the edge of my seat up until the 50-minute mark. The tension builds up really fast and you root for the protagonist. But the remaining 30 minutes were downright frustrating. The girl -a writer fyi- starts off as a resourceful and clever survivor that outsmarts the intruder in more than one occassion, but then she wastes many good opportunities to do in the killer once and for all. The killer's a random dude that shows up at the girl's house determined to kill her just for the kick of it. If he's so clearly a psycho, why waste time on learning how to use a crossbow when you're at your own house? Grab a knife and stab the guy. They're face to face many times. The chase is part of the movie, I get it. But she'a a writer. She's supposedly creative. And she's deaf and mute and lives out in the woods. How can she go out to live in the middle of nowhere with such a lousy surviving instinct and kit? It makes no sense."
" Frustrating.
",-0.4404,-0.429,2020-10-21 00:00:00,3,"I'm sorry, I just couldn't get over the fact that she lives in a glass house, and it was ""part of his game"" to not just break the floor to ceiling window, and walk into the house. Especially after she wounds him on multiple occasions, and he's obviously frustrated. I'd think he would call this one a wash, and just go murder her already. The cat and mouse game was only getting him hurt.
And I understand that she's not only deaf, but a mute incapable of talking, but even a mute would make some sort of screaming sound when shot in the leg with a crossbow.
I love Kate Siegel, which is pretty much the only reason I decided to finally watch this movie after 4 years of being released; but it was insulting to intelligent thought."
" 8 out of 10 for me!
",0.0,0.9841,2020-10-19 00:00:00,10,"I honestly love this movie. It's clever and it really draws you in. Another thing I like, which may sound totally weird to everyone, is that there's almost this playful tension and intimacy between the victim and prey throughout the entire film with the whole cat and mouse game. I felt like that brought a whole other element to the film that isn't found in horror. Aside from that though, it's definitely a fun watch and keeps you guessing. I found it extremely fresh and original. Loved it!"
" Love Kate siegel

" Boring
",-0.3182,0.1681,2020-10-07 00:00:00,2,I believed the ratings so I was expecting it to be good - but it was really boring. I also think they should have gotten a mute / deaf girl to play the main character.
" Where's the story?
",0.0,-0.9581,2020-09-28 00:00:00,3,"This movie was just terrible.
A lot of things in the script didn't make sense at all and overall there wasn't a real story actually.A deaf woman lives in a house in the woods. A random guy passes by and stabs her friend. Then he's just walking around until the neighbour comes. He stabs him too and continues walking around. Then he finally enters the house, she stabs him, the end.The woman is acting completely dumb but good for her: The Killer is equally dumb.
Same goes to the writers of this movie. As there are close to zero dialogues they should fill these 90 minutes otherwise but I think they kind of forgot. So, f√≥r 90 minutes we're watching this dude walking around and her climbing out of the window and back into the house, like five times.I was forcing myself to watch this movie until the end to see what all this is about. Why is he there? Is there a connection between them? Obviously one is expecting some twist in the end but there just isn't. He tries to kill her, she stabs him, the end.3/10 because at least her acting was quite good."
" Simple but Thrilling Slasher
",0.631,0.7651,2020-09-20 00:00:00,7,"The premise is simple; a slasher stalks a deaf mute author at her cabin in the woods. But strong writing, direction, and acting elevate this to a worthwhile watch. Its a tight little horror film that packs enough action and thrills into its location and runtime. Kate Siegel does an amazing job of endearing us to her and expressing her fear, panic and thought processes despite the vocal limits of her role. The killer also does a solid job of taunting her in this entertaining game of cat and mouse. One of the more worthwhile slashers of recent years and worth checking out."
" Terrible idiotic mess of movie
",-0.8481,-0.7305,2020-09-13 00:00:00,10,"This is without doubt one of the dumbest films I have ever seen. Why did I give it a ten star rating? Because the default is to read the highest reviews first. The character, far from being an intelligent, independent woman is a complete moron and the usual themes of Flanagan's whipped feminism are on display. Like in Gerald's Game the woman must rescue herself. Another man around is only more of the same problem, toxic I know what's best for you masculinity yada yada. Thus, we see the possible hero die as he is punished for the sins of the ubiquitous misogyny in all the world. Man, all men, in short, are slain by Flanagan's neurotic ideology. Outside, while the main character babbles to herself she lets the killer finish off her sure shot of survival. SO DUMB. There are a million times in this movie where you jump not from fright but from watching the atrociously stupid decisions of the main character, one that rational women find to be an insult to them all. Just ask my wife who asked repeatedly that we turn of the movie out of her disgust. We resisted the urge to turn it off time and time again culminating with the roof and wound cleaning idiocy. Only the moronic masses of low-wattage bulbs who think of themselves as bright can say this movie is good, that, or they are paid off in some way. DO NOT watch this film. Want a strong, smart woman? Watch Alien. Watch Dr. Arroway in Contact. There are good feminist type films but this is not one of them."

It's not overly scary. And home invasion movies are probably my most dreaded sub genre as The Strangers had me checking my doors for weeks. The premise is pretty silly as I just don't believe any woman would move to the woods and not think about the security aspect of living alone. I don't know any single woman who lives alone (including myself) that doesn't keep at least a baseball bat next to her bed. Let alone an apparently well off writer who could definitely afford an actual security system. The bad guy wasn't particularly scary save for the fact he's trying to kill her. His motivation isn't exactly apparent except he seems to be a hunter of some kind suffering from little man syndrome. That big neighbor guy would have 100% been able to take him out easily, but that would not have made for an interesting ending. All in all, it wasn't terrible. It was interesting enough for a movie night, but you really really have to suspend your common sense to believe it."

Killer present, does not think of getting a weapon for 20 minutes or so? Neighbour man about to knock him out with stone & she stops him. Neighbour guy chocking the killer & instead of coming out to help finish him she sits thinking. Killer climbs lattice, instead of pushing him off or hitting him again she crawls back inside.

" Quiet for a slasher movie
",0.0,-0.1533,2020-07-08 00:00:00,7,"In some ways not your ordinary horror movie. Director Mike Flanagan is also credited as co-writing with star Kate Siegel, who plays a deaf writer secluding herself in a home in the woods. She has learned to live with her disability; but how is she to tell when a killer is peeping in her windows. Not a lot of sound cues to warn you of shocking moments...and there will be some jumping in your seat. The psychotic killer's motives are pretty hushed. Flanagan hasn't revised how to tell a home invasion story, but sure gives you enough wiggle room.The cast also features Michael Trucco, Samantha Sloyan and John Gallager, Jr."
" Hush
",0.0,-0.9991,2020-07-04 00:00:00,5,"I would often see the image for this scary movie, produced by Blumhouse Productions (Insidious, Sinister, The Purge, Get Out), every time I would look at my list of things to watch on Netflix, it looked and sounded like it could be good. Basically, Maddie Young (Kate Siegel, also writing) is a deaf and mute woman who lost her hearing and speech as a teenager following meningitis and a failed corrective surgery. She has since become an author and lives an isolated life in the woods with her cat. One evening, her friend Sarah (Samantha Sloyan) visits her to return a copy of her latest published book. While discussing her writing, Maddie says that she visualises her stories, considering numerous endings before deciding on one. Later that night, a masked killer attacks Sarah and chases her to Maddie's house. A bloodied Sarah bangs on the door shouting for help; her cries are unheard because Maddie cannot hear her, and the man stabs Sarah to death. The killer realises Maddie is deaf and decides to make her another victim. He sneaks into her house, steals her mobile phone, takes photos of her, and sends them to her by email. Maddie realises she is being stalked, but the stranger cuts the power and sabotages her car to prevent her escaping. Maddie uses lipstick to write on the glass panel door, ""won't tell, didn't see face, boyfriend coming home"". The man (John Gallagher Jr.) responds by taking off his mask and revealing his face. Maddie tries to distract the man with her car alarm long enough to grab Sarah's phone from her body but fails. Mocking her, the man pockets the phone as well as one of Sarah's earrings. Maddie then tries to escape the house from the second story window, climbing onto the roof before climbing down the side. She is shot in the leg by a crossbow bolt, but she manages to knock the man off the roof and steal the crossbow. She staggers back into the house, removing the bolt from her leg before trying, unsuccessfully, to reload the crossbow. John (Michael Trucco), Sarah's boyfriend, arrives at Maddie's house looking for Sarah. The man appears and poses as a police deputy responding to a call. He claims he was knocked unconscious by an intruder. John is suspicious of his story, eventually seeing through his deception and gets ready to attack him with a rock. But Maddie knocking to get his attention distracts John and he is stabbed in the neck. John bleeds to death but gets the man in a chokehold long enough for Maddie to escape. However, Maddie realises that any attempt to escape or hide will result in her being caught or bleeding to death; her only chance for survival is to kill the man. Outside, the man is struck in the shoulder with a bolt, fired by Maddie. While retreating into the house, she drops the last bolt outside. Before she can grab it, the man slams the sliding door shut on her wrist, crushing her hand, until he allows Maddie to pull her mangled hand inside and close and lock the door. When he threatens to enter the house, Maddie writes ""do it, coward"" on the door with her own blood. As the man begins bashing the door to break the glass, Maddie rushes to her computer, typing up a description of the man and a message to her family. She concludes by writing that she ""died fighting"" before shutting her laptop, arms herself with a knife, and locks herself in the bathroom. The man has given up trying to break the glass and is making his way through the bathroom skylight, unbeknownst to Maddie. She is alerted to his presence when he inadvertently breathes against her neck. She narrowly avoids his attack and stabs him in the knee. Maddie stumbles into the kitchen, where she blinds the man with bug spray and the loud vibrating smoke alarm, disorienting him. He regains his sight and starts to strangle her. On the verge of death, Maddie grabs a corkscrew and plunges it into his neck, finally killing him. Maddie retrieves her phone from the man's body and dials 911 before stumbling outside. She sits on the porch and sees the blue police lights approaching, and strokes her cat smiling as she will finally be rescued. Also starring Emma Graves as Max. Siegel gives a good performance as the deaf woman terrorised by an unnamed killer, and Gallagher Jr. revels playing the killer who is having fun stalking the poor defenceless silent victim. It is a clever mix of a home invasion movie, crossed with some slasher conventions, the format is a little questionable at times, but it is well-paced, and has just the right amount of violence, tension and thrills, a fairly good horror. Worth watching!"

The main character literally had like 5 opportunities to kill the killer halfway through the movie.The interaction with the killer and the character is just so annoying and frustrating.Just a drawn out drama that should have never been made.I don't understand how this film has 6.6 stars, I expected it to be hovering just above a 4 or maybe a low 5.I had to turn it off about 50 minutes in because it was just SO stupid.Not scary.

" modern take on the home invasion thriller
",0.1027,0.9943,2020-05-23 00:00:00,7,"The film ""Hush"" focuses on 'Maddie' a deaf-mute writer who has retreated from city life and now lives secluded in the woods where she is being stalked by a psychotic killer who stumbles upon her home.There are aspects of this film that can be compared to ""The Strangers"" franchise, which is to be expected because that film is also a modern invasion film. ""Hush"" also shares similarities to ""Wait Until Dark"" which is about a blind woman who has intruders in her home. This film takes a more interesting route on the classic cat-and-mouse game making this film an intense watch and there are really no cliches in this film that are expected in other home invasion films. The film is more of a psychological thriller than a horror movie since it is not necessarily scary in my personal opinion. There are a few jumpscares throughout the film, but you can tell when they are coming. The entire plot is also affected entirely by strategy more than anything which makes you wonder what is going to happen as the film goes on. It really tries to make you think just like the character is forced to to get out of the situation that she is in.I really like that they did not use big name actors for this film because when well known actors are in a scary movie, it immediately takes away any sense of realness that comes from the film. One thing that I did not enjoy about this casting was Kate Siegel (Maddie) because she is not an actual deaf actor. Deaf actors would like jobs too. I feel like this is the equivalent to when we white wash characters that are traditionally played by a person of color. I also feel like if they had used an actual deaf actress then there would've been less misrepresentations of the deaf community in the film because they most likely would've been corrected.The female lead in this film is an excellent character because she is not like other women that have been in movies like this in the past. All of her actions are smart and extremely well thought out and I did not find myself being angry with anything that she does. All of the characters seem to be like this in the film because they are not completely oblivious to what is happening around them. I am not the biggest fan of the villain in this film because he seems to really be more cowardly for hunting a woman who has disabilities. It makes him less scary in that aspect because of that.The film has great cinematography and sound design. The shots in this film and some of the blocking in scenes are done extremely well and really triggers that paranoia that we all have when we are home alone. The film only has about 15 minutes of dialogue total, but the way that the energy is in the film you can really feel how 'Maddie"" is feeling without dialogue.There are some holes in the plot that create several questions throughout the film and will leave you wondering and wanting more and I wish that we would have gotten some of the answers to those questions, but I feel like the film is better leaving those questions unanswered. There are also things brought up along the way that are unneeded because they never go any further than that one moment that they are brought up.Overall, this film is great for people who would like to watch a scary film but do not like the traditional horror movie. This is not a film that I would personally sit down and watch on my own on repeat, but it is one of the better home invasion films that I have seen. The only way to watch this film is at home in the dark cuddled up with a blanket alone if you can handle it."

He obviously didn't know them.Why he didn't break the glass from the start if he only wanted to was to kill her?And at last, she was deaf because she had meningitis infection when we was young right?

The woman fending off this sadistic murderer is dead and mute, clearly a bad combination when a killer is involved. The movie was thought out well enough, though it is not exactly scary. I liked how the characters acted human rather than superhuman or very weak like a lot of horror movies show. The man is more powerful than the woman, but she holds her own due to her ability to think clearly in a scary situation. I would 100% recommend this movie for a singular watch."
" Decent thriller ruined by terrible character decisions
",-0.7003,-0.9972,2020-05-08 00:00:00,5,"The premise of this movie is actually pretty original. A deaf woman all alone is terrorized by a psychopath and attempts to stay alive despite her severe handicap. Unfortunately that's about where the movie starts showcasing some of the dumbest decisions by the main character and her attacker. The crazy guy just strolls up to the window and basically introduced himself. She sees that he has already killed her friend from next door but instead of preparing herself, she spends half the movie going from window to window just watching the guy. The killer doesn't seem all that bright either because he's just armed with a crossbow and a knife. He has no idea if she has a gun or anything to defend herself. He continues to march around the house and she continues to watch him.She makes a few stupid decisions to try and get out of the house and that just helps her to become severely injured. Instead of gearing up to defend herself she flounders around not doing much at all. The killer is also stupid as he basically hands her his crossbow. She goes through different scenarios in her mind about what to do and one of them is that she has to be very close to get a good shot with the crossbow. She then does the opposite and shoots at him from about 40 feet away. She hits him but it seems not to do much accept make him angry. Eventually he gets in the house and is right behind her but her super-senses warn her and she stabs him in the leg. She ends up in the kitchen and sprays him with bug spray and conveniently remembers to turn back on the extremely loud house alarm (which shouldn't work without power) and as he's choking her she stabs him and kills him. It's all just a mess of stupid writing and a bad story. Shame."

" A spectacular example for modern horror
",-0.5719,0.9667,2020-05-07 00:00:00,8,"So, to keep it brief, bush does suffer from regular horror movie problems, with a few moments being a little over the top, and some scenes bordering on silly. It's completely dark for a lot of the movie, and sometimes I feel like it's distracting from the scene, but otherwise the cinematography was fine. Other than that, the antagonist has some questionable acting, but it's not to big of a deal. Lastly, the competence of the characters is questionable from time to time, but it's like that with a lot of horror movies.Mike Flanagan is an extremely competent director and I think it reflects in the quality of each scene. Kate Siegel did great, and I felt extremely immersed in this movie. They managed to keep what should've been a repetitive confrontation extremely fresh throughout the whole movie. Story was good. Having the lead act deaf and mute made for an incredible story. Etc.All in all, it has its flaws, but for a modern horror movie (2010+) its crafted pretty well, and it's extremely engaging. It's clear there was a lot of talent supporting this wonderful film."
" One of the Best of the Decade!
",0.6696,0.9783,2020-05-03 00:00:00,9,"This film is intense, to warn you there are spoilers, because this isn't your normal trashy B grade horror flick with a nonsense, crappy, cheesy and predictable plot, this film is seriously INTELLIGENT compared to the crap people are putting out today. Let me just start off by saying Mike Flanagan is a true talent, he is definitely the greatest horror director working today, and I say that with true meaning.Doctor Sleep was truly one of the best films of 2019, so I went into this film just thinking that like with most horror directors, that this guy would just be a one hit wonder, but I was proven wrong. This movie has possibly one of the most unique and scariest villains ever put on screen, this film definitely screws with your head while you're watching it, we see a dream of what would happen to her if she took one route and what would happen if she took another. It has almost everything you could want from a horror movie if you're a true horror movie fan. That's the thing, this will divide audiences, some may love it, some may like it, some may hate it, some may dislike it, but you must appreciate itIt's so amazing how Flanagan can literally direct, produce, edit and write his movies, the first movie I ever saw by him was Before I Wake, it was definitely a great and unique horror film. Just to get this out in the open, I could never compare Flanagan to any other directors working today, but he would definitely be in my Top 5 Directors Working Today.Hush is basically about a deaf-mute lady, she is working on a novel and shows it to her friend, we see them communicate using sign language. Which leads on to the next scene where the friend is running to the door screaming for help, followed by her ex-boyfriend, he is armed with a bow and arrow, which is our first character dead. Then the neighbour's boyfriend comes by to check if his girlfriend is inside, then he encounters our villain, who plays as a detective to get his trust. But then he ends up dropping an item of his girlfriend's, so he grabs a rock and tries to knock him out with it, but he grabs out a knife just in time and gets his second victim.I feel like I don't need to explain more, as this is my longest review I've made and with good reason. 10/10"
" What a great thriller
",0.6705,0.1166,2020-05-03 00:00:00,7,"Hush is a movie about a deaf writer who has to fight for her life against a masked intruder. At only 81 minutes the movie gets straight to the point. What defines this movie is what makes it different from thrillers similar to it. Whenever you have a character who is either blind or deaf, it presents inherent problems with the plot. The director could have chose not to deal with those problems and simply make a horror thriller film. It was refreshing that the director chose to confront these problems head-on.The main criticism of this film is the premise. But in order for the story to work and not be heavily criticized for being unrealistic, it has to take that route. Maybe there was another way, but I could not think of it. And sometimes it seems like the characters have too many lives for their injuries, but I digress.Overall, I highly recommend seeing Hush."

" Such a wonderful wonderful movie!
",0.8268,0.2718,2020-03-21 00:00:00,7,"With only five characters, one location and a pretty simple plot, you'd expect this film to be decent popcorn entertainment at best.Hush is possibly one of the best horror movies of 2016. With an almost instantly likable protagonist, scares that don't rely on jumping out at you, and a killer that, while no Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers, will have you on the edge of your seat the second he makes his first move.Director Mike Flanagan brings this beautifully simple world to life in a way that feels truly realistic somehow, and with an unknown air that, in my opinion, makes Hush an instant overlooked classic.His wife, Kate Siegel, does her part in bringing our heroine Maddie to life perfectly. She's unbelievably likable and one of my favorite horror movie protagonists, in a way that, despite her uniqueness, makes her truly relatable as a writer who just can't think of a good ending to a story (Something I can fully understand).
Despite Maddie's natural disadvantages, being deaf and mute, she makes use of her other heightened senses and is incredibly intelligent for what may seem like a rather clich√© horror movie girl. Her use of her heightened senses also leads to my all-time favorite horror movie scene when the killer sneaks up behind her.Speaking of the killer, John Gallagher Jr. brings his A-game to the role of a psychopath who's crazy for the sake of being a psychopath. While you'll probably be screaming ""Just die already and leave Maddie alone!"" at your screen throughout most of the film, he's strangely enjoyable in a very twisted way, his likableness as a villain (For the sake of being a villain) is just one of the many reasons I love this film. I wouldn't be surprised if I went to some horror convention one day dressed as ""Man"" from Hush (And yes, I'd be including the crossbow, mask, and knife).Michael Trucco, Samantha Sloyan and Emilia Graves do great as side-characters who serve mostly as cannon-fodder, or to give enjoyable banter with Maddie in what's mostly a decently silent film. The killer probably has the most lines in the film, with rather typical but likable villain-like lines, and sometimes we take a dive into Maddie's head to see what she's thinking.All-in-all, Hush is a tragically overlooked instant classic in my books, with a loveable protagonist, a detestable but at the same time likable antagonist, fun side-characters and a simple plot that somehow works its way to being one of 2016's best horror films. This film is glaring proof that you don't need a ridiculously loaded plot, or a high body count to make one instant classic horror film.I couldn't suggest this film more, and if you don't like it, you have that right, but I cannot possibly understand why, because a strange simplicity is what makes this movie work so well.I hope you enjoy, and if not, I hope one day you'll find a horror film that is to you, what Hush is to me, simplistic perfection wrapped in a neat little bow with everything a horror movie could ever need.Oh, and on one last note, this movie does actually give way to a lot, and I mean a lot, of theories that I'll let you discover for yourself, because a lot of them are damn good, much like the film."
" Familiar but very well executed home invasion thriller
",0.5704,-0.8857,2020-03-16 00:00:00,8,"I had little interest in watching the Netflix Original horror film ""Hush"" until I'd watched the brilliant Netflix mini-series ""The Haunting of Hill House"" from writer/director Mike Flanagan. Hill House was a horror film that featured genuine depth of character and solid storytelling, as well as some of the scariest horror moments I'd seen in years (and not cheap jump scares, but genuine chills). ""Hush"" does not have the same depth as Hill House, but it does present a solid home invasion story about a deaf mute writer who is stalked by a masked killer in her remote cabin in the woods. That's pretty much the extent of the story, but ""Hush"" is endlessly clever, scary, and smart. Smart is a key factor missing from most horror films, which feature character doing the exact opposite of what thinking people would do. The characters here actually do what you would try to do in this type of a situation, both protagonists and antagonists, which makes the film far more effective. Home invasion films are a pretty played out horror film scenario, but they can work when given a new twist, such as the dystopian setting for ""The Purge"" or the hero/villain flip flop in ""Don't Breath"" where the home invaders become the victims. ""Hush"" offers no new twists, but is simply a very well executed, if altogether familiar, horror thriller."
" Great Movie!
",0.6588,0.8423,2020-03-14 00:00:00,8,It's a good slasher film. Considering it was made after 2010. Slasher films aren't created as much these days. It's not very slow paced and gets right into it like 10 minutes into the movie. The only downside to the movie is the unmasking 15-20 minutes into the movie. Other than that it was actually pretty good!

" Hush
",0.0,0.3291,2020-02-14 00:00:00,7,"Hush combines the familiarities of the home-invasion sub-genre with the unpredictability of its interesting premise.

It doesn't surpass every trope there is within its category, but it sprinkles plenty of ""oh, how will this turn out?"" questions across its short runtime to keep you on your toes."
" Doesn't take long for it to become just another home-invasion movie
",0.0,-0.9906,2020-02-01 00:00:00,5,"""Hush"" begins with an interesting and unique concept that makes it look like it has the potential to differentiate itself from the usual home invasion film. A deaf and mute writer is targeted by a killer in her isolated house in the woods. The simple fact that she is deaf and mute is what offers something unique but that is where it ends. It doesn't take long for ""Hush"" to play up all the cliches involving phones, lone neighbours stumbling over and getting themselves killed, and a stupid ending with the done-to-death finish, where the killer has the lead pinned to the ground, strangling the life out of them, before they conveniently reach out and just grab some random weapon before driving it through the villains throat. I'll give it the 5 star average for the tense atmosphere. And it was disturbing in parts. But other than that I can't recommend it."
" Interesting way to build suspense
",0.4019,0.9701,2020-02-01 00:00:00,8,"This movie isn't full of jump scares. It's a very simple story told straight.
There's not much character building and absolutely no character building for the attacker but it doesn't really need that to tell the story it wants to tell.I applaud what this movie is doing; telling a stalker story from the perspective of a deaf/mute individual. And it does an excellent job at putting you in her mind frame.And that last 15 minutes is the very best part; the movie builds suspense and fulfills it.It's well worth streaming on Netflix or Hulu or amazon prime; etc."

Also, the acting is pretty good, and I really like both of the main characters.You can tell that this movie isn't supposed to be a ""game-changing"" film. It's just a suspenseful movie that does everything very well.For this movie to hit a higher tier for me, I would've needed to see more of a motive behind the antagonist of the film. Throughout the movie, the bad guy is seen as just a guy that wants to kill apparently. On the other hand, I can repeat that the point of this film was to just get two solid hours of entertainment. It succeeded."
" Starts strongly, gets worse and worse as it goes on
",-0.6249,-0.8658,2019-11-17 00:00:00,4,"'Hush' is a home-invasion film with a difference in that the main character is both deaf and mute. At first this sounded like an interesting idea and appealed to me as someone who can't stand constant over-the-top screaming in films like this. But after a promising start in which the initial, somewhat plausible, scenario is set-up, things start to deteriorate.I was willing to overlook a few minor flaws until something happened that just couldn't be ignored. The attacker slashes the tyres on the woman's car, supposedly preventing her from escaping in it. Since when does this render a car unusable? The engine would still work and the car would still be able to move, even with four punctures. She could have quite easily escaped in it.The most far-fetched, frankly ridiculous part of the film, however, is when a character turns up at the house looking for his missing girlfriend and is greeted by the killer, who poses as a police officer. He's wearing normal clothes, looks nothing like a police officer and is acting extremely suspicious, yet the boyfriend never questions him or asks for ID. I mean please, nobody is that dumb."

A lot better than you'd think.A young woman, deaf-mute since the age of thirteen, lives in the woods in a big house with only her grimalkin for company most of the time. Late at night, a woman is murdered outside her home by a serial killer. Although the fiend is wearing a mask, he realises the woman inside the house must have heard the victim's cries and banging on the door. It doesn't take him long to realise he realised wrong, so what would any self-respecting serial killer do under those circumstances? One suspects he would depart the scene PDQ and plan his next kill methodically. Not this guy, he takes off the mask, and the duel begins.

Instead of being a full-lenght project, it should've been a short movie because the script doesn't give much of itself.
Don't really recommend it, but it's on Netflix so you can give it a try, at least is not as bad as every other slasher out there."

I thought it was quite a cool premise and I was intrigued to see what it brought to the table.The main character, Maddie is a compelling character and does not conform to deaf person stereotypes in movies she feels like a fully fleshed out character who is smart and is very resourceful. John Gallagher Jr. plays the perfect killer even though his mask is plastered all over the advertisements he takes it off in the first 10 minutes he is introduced and for the rest of the movie plays a psychopathic killer to a tee.The flaws are not to obvious the only thing that is unrealistic is some of Maddie's decisions, they either pay off or don't.Hush was a tense, fun horror movie and I would gladly watch again and I look forward to Mike Flanagans Doctor Sleep."

Unpredictable, scary, mysterious, difficult, complicated, unexplained....exactly what makes a perfect thriller. Especially for person with disability, together with other weaknesses such as being cut off from society and not have taken safety measures in advance. Very real.

The scenario of the movie is clever and interesting, because a deaf person has to be double as careful in this situation. In the first third the movie creates a scary atmosphere and the viewer recognizes the problem of her not beeing able to hear anything. But after the first 25 minutes, this scary atmosphere is gone and that's the big problem of the movie! At the beginning, the killer plays with her mind and the problem that she is deaf, but then he simply stops and acts so that it just is not scary anymore. This also creates problems for Maddie as a character, because in many moments the fact that she is deaf doesn't really matter. But it should because that is the movies main point! Although the film later makes a few good approaches, it doesn't help that much. So there is only one scene in the second half that was surprising for me. The cast, the location and the sound design is ok. Unfortunately, despite the good start, this film is only average. It's not good but not bad either, I only expected much more.
I CAN'T RECOMMEND you to watch it if you expect to see a great horror movie, because you will be disappointed. On the other hand it's not a time waste! You can definitely watch it, because the movie is okay especially more as a thriller than a horror movie. Just don't expect so much!Have a nice day!"

",0.4782,0.9811,2019-08-23 00:00:00,6,"I say let's not be harsh like the people with attention span problems are. For that year , it was probably the best horror.
Now the director and his gorgeous wife collab on a great setting and story. However the antagonist is quite the pooper the moment he reveals himself, not great with his demeanor lacking menace. He could be a good actor now but this film could have used a wrecked looking fella.
Love the struggle bits of Katie trying to outsmart him although some parts seemed to aid her momentary escapes. The cool moments are there but the crucial ones could be excecuted or shot at different angles to enhance the trick up either sleeves of the two. It seemed okay, but big moments should have been created better. Good flick not bad at all."
" A Masterclass in Tension that Defies Horror Expectations
",-0.7184,-0.8914,2019-08-14 00:00:00,8,"""Hush"" is a refreshing take on the Horror/Thriller genre because of its simplicity and ability to remain scary and engaging despite its lack of reliance on classic horror tropes.Appearing on basically every list of ""Hidden Netflix Gems You HAVE to See"", it's easy to understand why this film was such a sleeper hit: it's an indie horror film with a lower budget, a small cast, and a small scale. Yet all of these elements work to ""Hush""'s advantage; it's one of the most realistic-feeling horror movies in years because of it's confined setting and straight-forward plot. A deaf woman who lives alone in the woods is stalked by a masked killer. Simple and sweet. Taking a leaf from the books of both survival movies and slasher films, the tension in the film is incredibly tangible, as the viewer feels like he or she is in the midst of the movie alongside the protagonist, Maddie, scrambling to find a solution to the terrifying predicament.Like ""A Quiet Place"", one of the triumphs of the movie is the controlled use of both silence and sound. Since the protagonist is deaf, some of the most compelling and terrifying moments come when the viewer is put in Maddie's perspective, as she struggles her way through the fight with her attacker in dead silence. Despite a score that continues through much of the movie, there are many moments where the events play out without any sound at all; perhaps most notably the scene in the bathroom, where the killer breaks through Maddie's window just behind her without a noise to be heard. More so than many other survival-genre films, the viewer is really put in the protagonist's shoes, because of how well the usage of sound and lighting captures her experience.Possibly the highlight of the movie, however, is its constant aversion to the horror movie tropes that a moviegoer might expect from this film. Although there are a few jump scares, they are not overused in the slightest; in fact there are a number of moments where the director could have opted for a cheap jump scare and very intentionally didn't, which only adds to the fright. Another pleasant surprise was the unmasking of the killer very early on into the movie: as it turns out, it's not somebody she knows, it's not her ex-husband coming for revenge or whatever, it's just a random psychotic killer intent on tormenting her, with motives unknown. This not only contrasts the classic slasher formula of unmasking the killer near the end of the film, but it makes it that much scarier too, as the villain's true identity and motives are never revealed. And, possibly most importantly, the protagonist is not a COMPLETE IDIOT; although she makes a few (excusable) mistakes throughout the movie, Maddie is actually a pretty formidable opponent for her attacker, and doesn't fall for every trick in the horror movie book.Though not revolutionary by any means, ""Hush"" is still a super solid slasher flick, that is unpredictable, tense, and all-around enjoyable. A 100% worthwhile watch for anyone in the mood for a short and nail-biting thriller."

",-0.5106,-0.9845,2019-06-09 00:00:00,3,"Can't believe I finally had motivation to make an IMDB account just to review this terrible movie. Sorry for being too late, but I come here just to say this. I watched this movie because of its praise (6.6 on IMDB is a good score), but after the movie ended I was like What?. It's one of the worst slasher films I've ever watched. The characters make dumb choices, I mean really really dumb. I kinda hated the way the protagonist acts. She chooses the perfect time to bang on the door just to get the big guy killed. Then she stands there watching the neighbor struggling to strangle the killer. She can feel her phone vibrating from far away, but can't feel someone knocking on the door out loud just right behind her. Very stupid movie. I'd rate it on the same scale of stupidity of A Quiet Place. Speaking of A Quiet Place, that movie also involves making use of the hearing/sound concept. Oh my god, why are most of these types of movie are so stupid? I don't get why people love them so much."
" Nearly interesting, but not that nearly.
",0.2144,-0.9887,2019-06-08 00:00:00,2,"With an idea like the one Hush has, it had all the makings to be a tense and thrilling watch, unfortunately it never came close to anything brilliant.The idea of having a protagonist who deaf and mute opens so many avenues for a film, see A Quiet place, but Hush never really uses any of these obstacles until the final act or so, and even then they're used weakly. The face reveal of the bad guy is sloppily done and doesn't deliver the 'sadistic and murderous' aura that it's going for and the main protagonist is downright moronic at times with things like being unable to kill the baddie with a crossbow from 15 yards but being able to perfectly spray him in the eyes with bug spray......The murderous villain is hollow and at times dull, playing too far into the 'mysterious killer' troupe and not being scary just mildly irritating.All in all, Hush delivers a good opening 25-30 minutes but drops like a lead balloon after that, and with its shot runtime of sub 90 minutes, it feels like an effort to drag yourself over the line for a character you never bonded with and agains a villain that you're ambivalent towards"
" Decent tension builder
",-0.3182,0.992,2019-06-08 00:00:00,7,"Found this on Netflix and decided to give it a shot. I had tried to make it through The Blackcoat's Daughter earlier in the evening, but I bailed on that and went over to Hush; by comparison, this one is much better.The movie starts well enough by establishing Maddie's background and new situation. There is the element of Craig, her ex, who we feel may become prominent to the storyline but never does.Once the murderer arrives, it is clear he does not want to simply murder her, he wants to toy with her for a while. He's already murdered her friend and gained access to the house, but he opts to scare her first. This is the basis of the movie and where it starts to grow.The murderer is okay, not particularly smart, but sufficient. His assault on Sarah, followed by using her as a prop, was rather brutal. Other than that, I did not find his character notable.Maddie is a likable character. Despite her faults, we want her to win and take that guy out. She has at least two solid opportunities to end it, and they are both in the same scene. John, Sarah's boyfriend, is moments away from knocking the murderer out with a rock when Maddie inadvertently alerts the murderer by banging on the window. As a result, John gets stabbed and his plan is foiled. All is not lost, however, as he is able to recover enough to pin the murderer and choke him out. This is all happening about 20 ft. away from Maddie outside the house. Maddie has an ideal opportunity to walk up and deliver the final blow while John has the murderer pinned, but she blows it by staying in the house. This is somewhat confusing as we later see Maddie calculating all the possible outcomes depending on what she decides to do next. She is clearly logical enough to have known to make a move when John had the murderer down, yet that forethought was not put to her advantage. That, to me, is the weakest point of the movie.That aside, Maddie makes a good heroine. She keeps fighting and figures out how to use her lack of hearing to help her (fire alarm). Despite being put on the verge of death, she is able to hang on and turn the tide. I was cheering for her in those closing moments."

",0.3612,-0.7089,2019-05-18 00:00:00,8,"If you want something scary but don't care for the torture porn and jump scare overload that gets passed as ""true horror"" these days, HUSH will serve you well. The scares are built upon desolate atmosphere, the heroine's isolation, and the close cat and mouse game between her and the killer out to get her.The movie is essentially a two-person show, with Kate Siegel and John Gallagher Jr. engaging in a prolonged battle of resources and wits in a cabin in the woods. Siegel is sympathetic and smart as the deaf-mute heroine, though as a lead in this sort of thing, she isn't terribly distinctive as a personality. Same with Gallagher: he's creepy and sometimes even funny, but only barely above your usual run-of-the-mill slasher movie villain. They're credible though, which is more than can be said for the acting in most low-budget films of this sort.I'm not gonna lie: I wish this movie had been silent as the filmmakers originally intended. That kind of stylistic choice would have been radical true, but it would have bonded the audience to the main character to a greater degree and would have made the movie stand out a bit more from its subgenre.Regardless, this is a nice one to watch come the Halloween season. If you haven't seen it, it's worth a watch in the dark."

What kind of 21st century friendship is this?I enjoyed how the action started during the first act though I do wish that there was a little more character building on the killers part. I was surprised to see that the motivation wasn't a crime of passion, considering how many times he stabbed Sarah.However, I thought that the killer and Maddie were pretty evenly matched. The vast majority of my complaints were yelling about how a crossbow is a shitty weapon and what I would have done better (like definitely not leaving my knife and hammer behind and get him while he was reloading). I was pleasantly surprised to see the main character, while deaf, hold her own throughout the movie and not just become a ""damsel in distress"" if you will.

The main protagonist being deaf certainly adds an interesting element as she is at an disadvantage and has to work harder to survive. And she certainly was capable but I feel that the ""cat and mouse"" element of the film could have been better if the killer was actively trying to kill her and not purposely letting it be a game. The only reason why she lived so long is because the killer wanted to taunt her and let her sweat it out. Realistically, the movie would have been over a lot sooner. But overall, it was still entertaining and tension filled. However, by the last 10-15 min it does go into a super cliched horror movie end.I also genuinely liked the power move of the killer by removing his mask so early as to say ""I dont care if you see my face, cause Im gonna kill you"".

But they were quick and never capitalized upon. The villain in the movie just wasnt really scary enough for me to actually be nervous or worried. One good thing about the movie however, was that it was pretty believable.I guess I've been spoiled by Halloween and Jason.

",0.0,0.9667,2019-02-04 00:00:00,8,"The main thing I enjoyed about this movie was it wasn't as predictable as other horror movies. Movies today are very predictable which does not ruin the movie but it makes it less enjoyable. The movie it self was unlike other horror movies i have watched in the past. This movie was confusing in a way because you had no idea what his motives were and who he was to her. I took it into my own hands to make a theory of who he was. At sorta the beginning of the movie Maddie was talking to Max and she brought up that she started online dating for the deaf Which made me wonder if she was trying online dating when she was out in the city and it dint go good. I was thinking that maybe ""The Man"" was a relationship that ended badly. I know it was not craig because it clearly showed his profile picture. and showed the difference of the two men. (I thought there were various clues throughout the movie) Also another reason i thought of this was because when John shows up and ""The Man"" acts like a Sheriff, he clearly does not know everything about her, Which would indicate that he did not know her long.I noticed some things while watching it that i thought were a little unpolished1. How she did not feel the vibrations when Sarah pounded on the door2. (Same scene) Peripheral vision is a thing, right?3. Near the end of the movie she is in the bathroom sitting waiting for ""The Man"" and he comes down from somewhere. I'm just not understanding what. At first i thought it was a chimney but i don't know.
I rated this 8 out of 10 because i really liked how it didn't focus to much on who he was and more on the suspense of how it will be played out. I also really enjoyed that it was not as predictable as other movies. And lastly i felt the need to rewatch it to see if there was anything i didn't see last time to figure out who he was, Even if he was just supposed to be a random person (Maybe) ;)"

A lonely girl staying in an isolated cabin. The psycho killer who kills people for sport. The monotonous ending which was predictable from the start. Yes, the protagonist (Kate Siegel) was deaf and was not portrayed as a feeble horror movie girl. And to be honest, the fact that the lead character was brave and fought back the intruder kind of saved the movie from being a disappointment.Still, The film keeps you entertained until the end. You will enjoy watching Kate outsmarting her opponent. John Gallagher Jr. is definitely a detestable psycho killer. And the overall concept of 'being brave in the face of danger' is appealing.For me, the film was a blend of mediocre direction combined with the inability of the creators to fully integrate protagonist's deafness with her courage. But even with the cliches and loopholes, the movie delivers a breath of fresh air. I will recommend everyone to give it a try. It might just hit the right spots for you."

Grows up determined to win before he dies. He decides play one last game. He chooses a female opponent who is deaf and lives in a house with roughly 100 windows. The killer gets his card pulled as being a coward and quits the game. Then wants to kill her. Guess what happens next. I'll give you a hint...it happens in every movie you've seen before.

Instead of taking action, the killer just walk around the house, round and round,.......The killer stabbed the deaf women's friend so many times, with lots of action and vibration, but none of the acts bring to her attention?Her boyfriend showed up without even a car headlight shining on her window? Then he believed in the killer's lie of himself being a police office, despite no squad car outside.The killer was stabbed by her despite the fact that he is facing the girl and the girl can not see him.In summary, some of the scenes are very nicely shot, but the overall movie is a catastrophe because it does not flow naturally."

It came highly recommended to me by a fellow movie reviewer and thought: I need to check this out for myself.The plot is simple but very clever. We have our main female character Maddie, (Katie Siegel) who currently lives all alone in the woods writing her latest novel and getting over an ex boyfriend (sure it sounds like something we've heard before ), however, the catch in the plot here is the fact our main character, Maddie, is also Deaf.Maddie while working from home one night is approached by a masked psychotic crazy man and her crazy long night begins.What I really enjoy about this film is with a lead actor not being able to speak, the film really needed to rely on great acting and visual sounds effects, with which, to the film's credit, they have achieved amazing results.To give you thriller movie buffs a new appreciation for this film, according to IMDB this film ""HUSH"" Contains less than 15 minutes of dialogue... meaning that more than 70 minutes occur without a single spoken word... Respect!And I was amazed. Even with the lack of dialogue I still found myself entertained, tense and so curious to see the film to the end. While some things you might be able to pick what happens next, the film's still has a few surprises that I just didn't see coming, making the film a fun thrill ride.My only annoyance with Hush is as the audience there are scenes that we get to watch only discover to after what we saw didn't actually occur. It may be minor, but when a film tries to play with you I can't help but feel my time was wasted and struggling to trust the next scene. Please also be warned also for those who do not like harsh swearing you will be treated with foul language, which I felt was a little out of place.I respect the different direction and the risks this film takes & for those who love creepy thrillers this one for you.Most of this film is set at night so I also suggest you turn the lights off and turn the volume ... up umhahah !7.7/10

",0.3034,0.1653,2019-01-02 00:00:00,4,"This movie is not horrible, but it is very predictable and the victim does one stupid thing after another after another.She turns her back on the villain multiple times including secluding herself in a bathroom with her back to a window.When she finally makes choices it's always too late. I can see how extraordinary fear can paralyze a person. In the hands of a great actress, her slow decision making and even some of her bad decision making could be passed off as a byproduct of being completely terrified. I really do think Kate is a good actress but the writing and direction was average at best, and as much as I like Kate she is not capable of rescuing a subpar movie purely with acting chops.Kate and her husband wrote this part for her. I know she thought she could deliver but I walked away feeling like I had just seen another movie portraying women as stupid. She could have written a much smarter character for herself or simply paid a more talented actress to elevate the script. Some changes in direction could have also made Kate look less stupid and led to the whole film being more believable.Frankly, the villain was meant to be believed to be completely unhinged but other than his psychopatic tendencies there was no real vibe from him that could help you understand why any of this is happening. I know. I know. Sometimes it's better when we have to wonder ourselves. Easier to accept if the actor is believable.Also annoying, is there are multiple scenes where we are expected to believe she has no peripheral vision at all. I've always thought the absence of 1 sense heightens others. Not in her case.As short as this movie is it seems to drag out far more than it should. I'm not saying don't watch it, but go into it with the understanding that it is an average movie, at best."
" A good way to kill an hour and 20 minutes but not much else
",-0.2263,0.7157,2018-12-25 00:00:00,5,"I can't lie, I was kinda disappointed in this movie. With a premise like this movies, I couldn't help but expect better, especially considering he directed Oculus and Oujia origins of evil. But in the end, multiple problems I had with this movie brought it to a 5.First off, from a movie making perspective it was good. The movie looked good from cinematography, color palette, and effects standpoint. Also, the movie sounded good. The use of sound (or lack thereof) made the movie better, along with the good score.Also, the acting is great. The main character is a fine protagonist, and the villain has enough mystery around him to keep me interested. Also, most of the first act was great, with the dialogue, scenes, tension building and more.However, the second and third act heavily fall apart. For one, the characters are extremely stupid. Throughout the film I was close to yelling at the screen just because I was so annoyed by the idiotic characters making what seemed to be the stupidest decisions out there. This ruined a lot of the tension for me, as I stopped caring about the main character, just because I was so annoyed by she was acting and started to stop caring for her as a character and whether she lived or died. Also, the main. Antagonist also could have easily killed the protagonist many times but didn't. Also, some of the scenes felt unnecessary; not good considering how short the movie was
.there was a scene on the bathroom that was very much obviously filler. It felt cheap and made me wish to be watching a more interesting movie. Also, the ending isn't great. Some of the spacial logic got completely thrown out the window in the end This all, and the fact that movie got so stupid to where we started seeing a copy of the main character tell the main. Character what to do really bogged the movie down for me. Overall, the 2nd and third act are not good and could have been so much better.If I had to say whether you should watch the movie, sure. It is a decent home invasion movie with an interesting premise that could be a fun way to pass time on a flight or car drive, or just to pass the time overall."
" Steer clear and avoid wasting your time
",-0.3182,0.8665,2018-12-18 00:00:00,1,"Please do steer clear of this movie and avoid wasting some time which might otherwise be well spent. This is a case of a movie with no pace, no real characters (there's absolutely no motivation for the villain's actions and he does look/act somewhat ridiculous) and, most importantly, no real story. The story is immensely boring and predictable, and successfully manages to not scare you at all, or even surprise you. I'm appalled at some reviews that dare to compare this mediocrity to superb arthouse films like It Follows. The only explanation could be that the good reviews were written by the movie's promo team; whatever the reason, do not make the same mistake I did and believe the positive reviews. This movie is the ABSOLUTE waste of time."

The quiet moments in the film are highly effective, emphasizing the fact the protagonist is deaf. Kate Siegel's acting is (once again) very good, but even she couldn't save the film for me.There are just way too many plot holes and unanswered questions. Sure, this is a home invasion film and ultimately a story about survival, as she fights the intruder. But why did the intruder do that? Why did he kill the neighbor, but toyed with Maddie (Siegel), or should one assume he did the same with the neighbor? What was his intentions for wanting to kill her? If this was a robbery gone wrong, where Maddie got in the way, it would make perfect sense. The guy surely must be a psychopath, but still, what were his motives? I found this to be a very undeveloped idea, and the film never really blew me away. On the contrary, I eventually wanted this to end.The film is also almost entirely in the dark. It was ultimately also predictable. I doubt I'll ever watch it again..."

" simple small horror
",-0.5719,-0.6132,2018-11-01 00:00:00,6,"Maddie Young (Kate Siegel) is a deaf writer living alone in an isolated house in the woods. She lost her hearing at 13. Sarah is a neighbor friend who admires her writing. She gets killed by a masked man with a crossbow at Maddie's door but Maddie is unable to hear the commotion. Maddie becomes the next target of the sadistic killer.This is a really simple small contained horror perfect for Blumhouse. It's very solid with a couple of minor issues. The house, being such an important setting, needs a through tour to show the layout for the audience. John's arrival leads to a couple of more problems. First, he's tapping on the glass like she would hear him when he knows she's deaf. Second, he's suspicious but he can't know for sure about anything. It's more logical to separate yourself from the other guy and call the cops. The scene straddles a fine line between tension and disbelief. It slips over that line a little at a couple of points. The best scene is her considering all the possibilities and tying it back to her murder mystery writing skills. A cool way to end this would have been for the movie to go silent as the cops with their sirens come driving up the road. Instead it's only fading out the sirens which is fine but it doesn't trust the silence and insists on a sound effect. Honestly, the closing credits should all be done in silence. These are all little annoying choices which subtracts from my enjoyment of a really simple horror concept. Also I would figure this is scarier for women who live alone in big houses."

" Hush silences noisy distractions with its deafeningly precise direction.
",-0.4019,0.867,2018-10-21 00:00:00,7,"Flanagan is certainly a director I've had my eye on. 'Oculus' was a surprisingly neat horror/thriller and this domestic slasher is no different. Clean, concise and packing plenty of thrills. Just make sure you stay quiet throughout. A deaf mute novelist is trapped in her own abode by a sadistic killer, using only her survival instincts to stay alive. Diminishing not one but two sensory organs allows this thriller to experiment with its suspense. Unable to hear her killer and unable to communicate for help, she must use her other heightened senses to outwit her opponent. It's a simple plot, however its overly simplistic narrative never detracts from the stylistic suspense. Her perceptions of touch and vibration is accentuated through to the audience by maximising the inventive sound editing. Background noise is often nullified in order to assist in portraying her perspective in this terrifying scenario. Triggered alarms and heavy footsteps have their sound effects increased to convey how loud they truly are. It makes for a suspenseful experience, but one that evokes auditory and visionary entertainment. A perfectly short runtime to justify the simple plot, however it does encounter inconsistent pacing as it struggles to maintain tension. Scenes often feel over extended, particularly during the second act as both individuals wander around in darkness, and that's mostly due to the lack of environmental change. It's filmed in one location, with just two actors for the vast majority of the film. With that being said, it's quite an achievement to craft a realistic domestic thriller given those intended limitations. Suitably thrilling and frequently graphic (her poor hand...), accompanied by gorgeous cinematography and astute direction. Now shhhh and go watch it."

" Texas Chainsaw 4 was better, and that's saying something
",0.4404,-0.9989,2018-10-18 00:00:00,2,"I usually don't write reviews, but after viewing this I felt I had to, and gosh.. what an awful film. Okay, there are much worse films that butcher it's own continuity, this one does an okay job at that as this is the original. Hush follows a deaf writer, Maddie, who went deaf with special illnesses that cause her to be deaf and also be unable to speak when she was 13. The film starts with her trying to cook from a recipe she found online when she gets a message from her friend wanting to come over, and so she does. 
They talk for a bit...with sign language when a special fire alarm goes off in Maddie's kitchen, they go inside to clean up and turn it off. 
Not long after this Maddie's friend goes home, but not long after to return, running, screaming, and pounding on Maddie's door, hoping she'll see and let her in. That's when an arrow shoots into her back and I figure comes walking up, grabbing hold of her and stabbing her over and over again in the stomach and carrying her off. 
Maddies gets a message from ""Craig"" who I only assume to be an ex boyfriend because why else would a girl be ignoring someone like a twat. After many attempts she actually considers talking to him but the second she calls she retreats. Shortly after this she gets a call from one of her friends, she sets her phone on the table while the killer just lets himself in and swipes her phone. 
Soon Maddie ends the call and goes to look for the cat that lives near her house, shaking the food bowl as she walks to signal the cat, when she gets back however she finds messages sent from her phone, of pictures the killer has taken of her. Instantly and surprisingly she tries to contact the police using her computer, but not before the killer walks outside and cuts off her power. Maddie locks out the killer and writes on the glass door using lipstick that her boyfriend is coming home..and what does the killer do? ...He takes off his mask. That's what he does, he takes off his mask. He reveals his FACE to his victim who if somehow gets out of this alive can now report what he looks like to the police. 
During the rest of the duration of the movie they shuffle around, the killer kills one more guy, Maddie steals one of his weapons, and kills him at the end of the film while he is choking her to death, literally at the last second of life. The good: The killer gets a few good shots in, shooting Maddie once with an arrow and crushing her fingers with the door. The bad: The killer falls for just about every trick in the book. At one point Maddie while she's outside throws like this flashy ball across the woods, and he goes to see what it is while she climbs to another part of the house. Also, the killer could have gotten inside the house at any point in this movie. There's one scene where Maddie stabs his arm with the claw side of the hammer which he could have used to smash the window, and if not for that he could have thrown a rock through the glass door or even use one of his weapons, only at the very end of the movie does he actually do this and during the entire movie I was cringing for him to do this. Finally, he keeps his mask off for the entirety of this film. That isn't too bad of a sin, but masked killers should stay masked killers. We only see him masked for a small fraction of the film."
" Does not have a good plot but has great cinematography components
",0.7138,-0.9908,2018-10-15 00:00:00,4,"Stella Reagan Mr. Taff Period 3 October 10th, 2018 The movie Hush was an unimpressive film, for it was a mediocre horror film and easily predictable. The movie, which was mostly uneventful, had the basic story line of a horror movie about an attacker and victim. Although the plot, characters and the theme were plain, all the cinematography elements in the movie were surprisingly exceptional. The production, by Jason Blum, was carefully crafted and well thought out. Jason had the right idea, but the movie, directed by Mike Flanagan, ended up turning out disappointing for the picture envisioned by him. Mike Flanagan and Kate Spiegel collaborated to write the script, which was mundane and lacking in structure. Maddie (Kate Spiegel) used sign language, as she was deaf, but her lines were short and simple. The aspects of production design and cinematography were the greatest part of the movie. James Kniest, the director of photography, chose the right angles for the cameras and recorded each scene in an excellent way. Differing camera angles helped move along the theme and develop the fear in the watchers. To add a different aspect of fear, Elizabeth Boller, production designer, controlled which special effects would be added. She made the right choices throughout the movie, whether it be set placement, special effects, or clothes, they fit into the film seamlessly. Joshua Adeniji, sound director, made the overall sound so realistic it was completely immersive and could make someone feel as if they were in the actual movie. If they listen carefully enough, every little sound is included in the audio. Editing work done by Mike Flanagan was acceptable. The sequencing of the different camera angles was not put together well, and there was not a feasible thought process in the style of editing Mike used. Setting, plot and theme of Hush was typical for most horror movies. Horror movies usually have a type of horror, like suspense, mystery, thrill, or clich√© and Hush had all those themes, but clich√© stood out the most. The Man (John Gallagher Jr.) showed up at Maddie's (Kate Spiegel) house and held a one-person vigil, where he stalks and terrorizes Maddie to a point of thinking about her death. The movie takes place at night at Maddie's house which is isolated it the woods with one neighbor nearby. The actions of the characters revert to older horror movies with obvious wrong decisions of the victim and the same anticipated actions of the attacker. And the film jostled around the idea of helpless damsel against a strong intruder, but in the end, the tables turn, Maddie overthrows The Man and makes out alive. Yet again, clich√©, the main character gets out alive. The movie Hush was a clich√© horror movie that can be describes as mediocre, predictable, and unimpressive. The main character escapes the threat and lives to tell the story, just like any other horror movie with those types of endings. Aside from the ordinary story line setting and themes, the cinematography of Hush was outstanding. Hush was not a desirable movie, for it was not original, but was a model movie based on cinematography and production skills."
" Unlikable heroine, boring script, this film will make you hate cats.
",-0.3182,-0.9932,2018-10-14 00:00:00,2,"Fair acting, a simple plot, a tiny taste of gore and two predictable characters in an overused setting. So you got the comely lady in distress, somewhere in the forest, a red riding hood in her own right, terrorized by the big bad wolf, in this case, a far from intimidating baldie with a penchant for medieval weapons. Other than that our villain has zero depth, no background, no motives, just a dude who enjoys killing. 
Of course in this genre, you expect the seemingly fragile heroine to somehow prevail against all odds, depending solely on her own resources. It would have been an average film, had it not been for our cute protagonist been such an unlikable character. Even her disability does not make you feel any compassion for her, as she allows her neighbor and apparently good friend to get murdered at the very beginning of the film, and becomes the reason the former's boyfriend gets murdered as well, seconds before delivering the decisive blow that would mean her salvation. She watches the poor struggle while wounded to save both of them, without intervening even while odds are on their side. However, when the life of her equally unlikable pet is in danger, she will knowingly sacrifice her only chance at getting a good shot at the villain. Maddie is not only stupid but also a heartless cat lady, which disregards human life and has a disturbing fixation to the fluffy feline. Maddie, we hate you. Towards the end of the film, I disliked Maddie so much that I was actually wishing for a deviation from the formulaic version of the story and see her tortured and maimed by the villain. Unfortunately, Mike Flanagan who wrote this boring script failed to deliver. Maddie kills the baddie and lives happily ever after with her stupid cat."

",-0.25,-0.5387,2018-09-23 00:00:00,6,"Hush has a great concept but the filmmakers did not take advantage of it. We did not have enough time in the perspective of the protagonist which unfortunately made her deafness seem more like a gimmick when, if used effectively, it could have been used to make us feel her vulnerability. The delivery of information to the audience is done quite creatively which managed to keep my attention for the whole 80 minute runtime.
There are a few eye-roll moments and a couple of times when she forgets to be deaf but it is matched by the quantity of tense scenes, some of which are repetitive; others that are genuinely scary. 
The movie lacks in tension for a significant portion, however, because although the antagonist is supposed to have the upper hand over our hero, he seems to be on the back foot when faced with her Kevin McCallister-esque fighting style.Overall, Hush is entertaining, slightly flawed, and in some points, quite scary.

" It's like the opening of Scream but without the screams!
",0.3662,0.7623,2018-09-21 00:00:00,7,"Hush Like all good slasher movies Hush shares many a cliche but what sets this film apart is the very strong central performance by Kate Siegel.
No this movie doesn't really bring anything new to the table but it is crafted with a level of care and pride that elevates it above most of its peers.Hush tells the story of Maddie a deaf and mute novelist who has retreated to the woods.
Here she resides in a rather lovely abode but before long her peace and tranquillity is destroyed by a murderous intruder.
It is here where Siegel's performance shines.
She carries the movie without dialogue and conveys peril merely with facial expression and body language.
Think of Hush as the opening scene of the movie Scream but without the screams!
There's only a small cast as it is Siegel and her murderous nemesis 'The man' played by John Gallagher Jr that drive story.
The evil intruder proceeds to play cat and mouse with Maddie, in the belief he can kill her anytime he wants.
Sure Hush is riddled with our victim/heroine making bad choices. It wouldn't be a slasher style movie without them.
Turning right when she should have gone left.
Hitting the man in the forearm with a claw hammer when it was more than achievable to hit his head.
That said director Mike Flanagan does ramp up tension and the gore is dialled way passed eleven.
Certain elements could have been explored further.
Maddie's deafness could have been used to good effect on the audience. This allowing us to be in her shoes. Instead this was never utilised properly.
Shame as the opening of the movie is in silence before oversaturated sounds of cooking, chopping etc bursts through the speakers.
It would have been nice to amp up the shock factor by using the absence of sound to disorient the audience.With that gripe aside Hush is still a decent throw away popcorn flick. One that does offer a little more due to the fine performance by Kate Siegel."

Our killer, using her lack of hearing to it's fullest advantage, to mentally torture a lonely woman in an isolated home. But, she's much more clever than you'd think, so it does turn into a battle of wits rather than jumpscare after jumpscare. But, don't be mistaken, it's still tense.

At a critical point in the film she manages to get to her laptop and write a goodbye note to her Mom and using the phrase ""I died fighting"". Later on there is a scene where the killer is on on top of her and choking her on the floor. Everything goes silent EXCEPT for the sound of her pounding heartbeat getting slower and slower until...there is no sound at all and she closes her eyes. This is the point at which she DIES in the film. Everything after that is just a fantasy of her overtaking and killing the killer.

 I saw this movie a week ago, and for a week this movie has haunted my dreams. How are there so many good reviews for this film? I feel like I'm loosing my grip on reality. It just makes no sense. 
Pretty early on in the movie I found myself rooting for the antagonist (who had absolutely no back story nor motivation whatsoever) simply because if you are not even going to arm yourself or get some semblance of a plan together then apparently you didn't care to be alive that much in the first place. Early on she had the knife hammer combo going on and it worked for her, then she ditches weaponry all together. some how she manages to get the crossbow from this friggin murderous boy scout and wastes her time trying to load it for like 20 minutes where she just stops caring about keeping an eye on the guy. All this could have been overlooked because I was pretty baked, but why in God's name would you not finish the dude off when he was being held in the dying chokehold of maybe the most gullible man in the world? He used his last dying breaths to try and strangle this man, has him completely immobilized and she just sits inside watching like a helpless dumb dumb. I mean stab that dude, help out just a little.

" Silent horror with some flaws
",-0.5719,0.9585,2018-07-18 00:00:00,7,"I hesitated before watching this one because I don't like horror movies that are too scary, and that mask made me feel sick. Well, luckily the mask didn't stick around for long which I found a bit strange because it did make the man 100% scarier.This movie would have been so ordinary and basic if the main character had not been deaf. That added a new level of horror because she never knew where the man was unless she saw him. I found my heart beating so fast at times because somehow I could feel her panic through the screen. Maybe that was due to the fact that the actors were great or maybe the director just did a good job. Then to the flaws. At times the movie was very predictable and Maddie made some very strange decisions that annoyed the heck out of me. It's a horror movie so obviously it has to take place at night, which made every scene very dark. My screen was at full brightness and I still had trouble seeing what was going on. I also found it very weird that the viewer never gets to find out who 'The man' is and most importantly, why would he want to kill Maddie? I could maybe watch this one again. Not too scary but enough to leave you biting your nails at times. Probably too dull for someone who loves terrifying horror films. The actors were great and fit their roles perfectly. Not too much of those boring filler scenes. The best part of the movie was however the fact that the cat did not die, I could hug the writers for that."
" Not dull, but there are definite script problems
",-0.0698,-0.9098,2018-07-13 00:00:00,5,"The Blumhouse production ""Hush"" may have got a little inspiration from the 60s movie ""Wait Until Dark"", though this time around it involves a woman who is not blind, but is deaf. And probably due to the low budget, the woman this time around is only threatened by one intruder instead of several. Despite the low budget, the movie does not really come across as cheap, as is usual for Blumhouse productions. And the whole package overall comes across as watchable... but that's all. As I indicated in my subject line, there are some elements in the script that really scream for a rewrite. The bad guy's motivation is basically that of a masked killer from a 1980s slasher movie - namely no motivation (or real personality) at all. And it seems very silly that he keeps toying around with the heroine for a very long time, even when she starts to inflict some serious hurt on him. There are other elements hard to swallow, like how he manages to impersonate a police office despite not having a uniform or badge, but I won't bore you with those details. The movie still commands your attention despite such plot stupidities - there are some suspenseful moments, for one thing - but the sometimes bad writing really holds it back. Had the screenplay been a lot smarter and realistic, we might have had a sleeper of a thriller here. But as it is, it just passes the time, and not much more."

This whole movie would have been over in 5 minutes if that dude had come to my house. 38 special. Need I say more?She repeatedly leaves the house without a weapon. If she had grabbed a knife and hidden under the stairs and waited for him to walk by, she could have at least cut his achilles tendon and run.And if you're handicapped and live alone in the woods, you'd better have some way of contacting police, or protecting yourself. Then, she gets her friend's husband killed. Urgh. That was really maddening. What is the whole moral of the story? Call your ex back when you get that urge and invite him over? If she had done that, none of this would have happened? What was the story with him anyway? There wasn't enough background to the plot. What was the motive of the killer? Why the mask, if he was going to take it off so early on? I give it 7 stars because it had a decent ending, and it was definitely a nail-biter."

I think because the victim is initially unaware of the perpetrator, the film is given a different twist, plenty of thrills follow. Listed as a horror, I suppose the premise fits it into that genre, but in reality it's very much a psychological thriller. Don't get me wrong there were some scares, like the bath scene, but generally it's a thriller.Kate Siegel and John Gallagher Jr. are just incredible, two particularly good and contrasting performances. Perhaps because the film features less dialogue then the norm you are encouraged to watch it without looking away at phones and tablets etc, you are forced into a greater concentration.So much more then the usual house invasion film."
" An extra star because I heart Mike Flanagan
",0.0,-0.6913,2018-01-30 00:00:00,8,"Hush might not be the best movie ever, but it has that Mike Flanagan pace and tone, which made me like it before I even knew who Mike Flanagan was. I said that Hush might not be the best movie ever, but it certainly isn't the worst. It was concise, paced very well and well-acted by both Kate Siegel and John Gallagher Jr. I've seen people say that The Man's motives were unclear, that things didn't make sense. To me, that is what pushes this movie a little higher in the originality department. It's fascinating that we don't know The Man's motives, but we see his brutality and madness in full bloom. Yes, he was sloppy and he and Maddie could have killed each other a few times before the end, but that worked for me BECAUSE he was totally unhinged. This is worth a watch if you like suspenseful movies that contain some violence. The real thing to watch is Mike Flanagan."
" A thriller that has more to it than one would expect
",0.1027,-0.9658,2018-01-26 00:00:00,7,"Throughout history, there have been all kinds of stories dealing with mysterious killers. Some of which still have not been named or captured and have lived in infamy for their obscene crimes. For horror films, the horror genre has made use of these stories to give viewers a better understanding how things went down. Whether certain liberties were taken with the material varies, but it's how the film makes the viewers feel after coming out is what matters. Several horror films rely more on gore and violence when really a movie with the exact opposite in traits can be just as terrifying. This is exactly what happens in this movie, which at first felt like it was going to be a by the numbers killing type horror film, when really, it wasn't at all. Prepare to feel the most restrained you've ever felt in some time.The story to this killer thriller is about Maddie (Kate Siegel), an author of a popular book. Hoping to strike gold and create another great novel, she continues to write in her home on her own. What may not be evident is the fact that she is mute and deaf. The only way she communicates is through sign language and mouthing words. She has a few friends but none that live with her on a constant basis. Unfortunately for her, a stalker (John Gallagher Jr.) discovers her house and realizes she has these disabilities. With that said he decides it would be great to slowly mentally torture her. Written and directed Mike Flanagan, this movie is one of the more taught ones shown in a while. Since much of the story revolves around these two, the development only happens here. Much of it is placed on Maddie, who goes through several strategies on how to escape the evil that has fallen on her.The weakest link is actually the killer because nothing is really explained about him. The character name is just called ""the man"", and that's fine. Not every psycho has to have a name, it makes it all the more creepy. However, having no reason for the motivation of killing is something else. This is exactly the problem with Gallagher's role. He has no rationale as to why he's doing what he's doing. That doesn't mean he has to have a connection to Siegel's character either. But there must be something that is making this guy do what he's doing. Yet this part is overshadowed as to just how creative the heroine lead becomes when she realizes she's starting to run out of options. That's where things become so white-knuckled, it becomes too difficult to just sit and watch. Some viewers may feel the need to retroactively try and yell recommendations to the screen. As if the individuals on screen could hear.Kate Siegel as Maddie does a great job. She truly makes a viewer believe everything she goes through. And as clich√© as it is to have a female lead in a horror film, she deserves this one. Siegel has been in other productions prior but this would be her breakout role. It's truly impressive to watch this film unfold because of how well it was directed. Normally writer directors have tough times producing adequate films because the task of doing both isn't easy. However being that this was a small production, this might've lessened the burden. Flanagan was also the director to movies like Oculus (2013), Before I Wake (2016), Ouija: Origin of Evil (2016) and Gerald's Game (2017). Being that these movies have all had mainly positive praise, this shows Flanagan has a knack for the genre. This goes hand in hand with the tension delivered. Much of the execution remains silent to make the viewer feel like Maddie, which helps a lot. In some ways it reminisces to that of James Wan's Dead Silence (2007).Camerawork was well put together too. James Kniest was the director of photography to this feature. Even though the overall setting changes very little, Kniest manages to find ways of showing every inch and crack of the house Maddie lives in. Kniest worked on other movies like Annabelle (2014), Within (2016) and The Bye Bye Man (2017). Adding to that is the violence that occurs throughout the running time. There's not a lot of gore, but what is shown still can get pretty gnarly. Some of it can really make a viewer cringe. Sadly this could also be said for film score. Composed by a duo who go by the Newton Brothers, the music to this movie isn't that impressive. It is understandable as to why it isn't heard much, but when it is used, it's not ultimately that complex. Thankfully it has no jump stings, but the organics of it does not blend with the visuals and comes off rather forgettable. Even if they worked with director Flanagan before.While the music and antagonist motives are not that well rounded, the rest of this thriller is tense in its structure. The two main actors work their parts well, the cinematography is engaging and the whole situation presented to the audience reminds us just how vulnerable we all can be alone at home."
" Can't run. Can't hide or leave.

Kate sometimes hears voices in her head that help her write, now they are trying to save her life. This was a pretty good home break-in type of film. it follows the formula and as such was too long in the middle during the run and hide scenes. Guide: 1F-word. No sex or nudity."
" Tedious, frustrating and annoying.
",-0.6808,0.2596,2018-01-06 00:00:00,2,"No spoilers, because this movie may appeal to mouth-breathers who identify with the similarly-afflicted villain in this mess. (I can't call him the antagonist, with a clear conscience).Briefly, this is a story of an evident imbecile who decides to murder an apparent moron. Since the unfortunate leading actors play similarly unintentionally slow-witted roles, there is absolutely no incentive for the viewer to become invested in the outcome. Some reviewers hoped that the damsel in distress would just get snuffed out already and gotten over with - but I can't pretend to be that concerned for the success of either party.But that's not all. It gets worse.The majority of the activity is filmed in the dark. Not just ""Hollywood dark"", as in a filter placed over the camera lens to indicate that it's dark, but actual darkness. So, congratulations to anyone with the ability to absorb photons more efficiently than the ordinary humans among us. Since many psycho-thrillers are completely dependent on the protagonists making stupid decisions, it may be some sort of a mixed blessing that this one makes no departure from that trusty, rusty, old plot device - and stupid decisions pop up with tedious regularity. Accordingly, the vague movements that are dimly noticeable on the dark screen eventually become unimportant enough for us to give up caring about whatever the heck is supposed to be happening. I watched this dreck virtually for free on Netflix. In my experience, one has to watch a lot of terrible movies in order to appreciate the better ones, so the time lost on this poorly-written and badly-directed pap is just another lesson. Also, I could easily afford the risk of paying less than one hundred percent of my attention to the frequent, boring interludes, to read up about the movie so that I could put the visible fragments together. Without IMDB and Wikipedia to literally spell it out for me, I would still be in the dark. 'Hush' gets two stars because I watched the entire thing. Single stars are reserved for the unwatchable, thus causing the artificially higher rating that I attribute to this one.A stupid story and and a poorly made flick."

",0.5093,0.9748,2017-12-15 00:00:00,10,"I didn't expect to love Hush as much as I do, but this movie is phenomenal. 
Firstly, the main character is disabled, deaf/mute combo which makes it impossible for her to call for help or hear the killer coming. She is a realistic human being with debilitating weaknesses but an inner strength that you don't often see in movies- she's a writer, so she can think things through. She looks at every possible ending for her story and picks her best options, thinks every move through and manages to be incredibly smart and resourceful throughout. 
The editing and direction is astonishingly good as well- the sound editing is like no other film, and each cut and shot was composed perfectly, which is a SERIOUSLY lacking part of the horror genre.
You feel for this character and believe her struggle in every second of this movie, and there wasn't a single scare that wasn't earned.
I've seen this movie eight times, and I could watch it so many more. It's a wonderful film with heart-pounding action, believable characters and a grounded situation. You're right there with the protagonist, reflecting on what her best move is going forward. Absolutely incredible."

",0.5321,0.5367,2017-12-13 00:00:00,5,Kate Seigel's captivating performance along with solid cinematography and crisp editing make this otherwise passive film bearable to an extent. The film was not able to create any real tension since most of the situations are too familiar from a lot of films and the bad guy was just a stupid character. The film is not boring but there's no point in it just trying to recreate what has been done so many times. Kate Seigel was amazing as the deaf-mute writer and she deserves more prominent roles.
" Not enough there there
",0.0,0.5329,2017-12-08 00:00:00,4,"The plot of ""Hush"" could be thoroughly summarized on an old Acopolco postcard (from back when people still went there). The dialog would require two postcards. This leaves us with acting. John Gallagher, Jr. plays the backstory-impaired home invader who is only slightly more effective than Harry Lime and Marv Merchants. John attempts to play the killer as menacing while still kinda inept. The limitation here is Gallagher seems like a guy in real life who asks you are and actually wants a response. Director Mike Flanigan needed someone more naturally menacing like an Alabama congressman or Andy Dick. In short, a bit off topic but if the main character wasn't deaf, would it have changed the proceedings in any meaningful way? The Westchestarian thinks not."

This film has such a good record those. But apart from the performances and settings, there's nothing special. The same old home-invasion concept with so many flaws. If you are looking for nothing but an entertainment, then this will provide you that. But you should not expect more than that, it will foil you from having a nice time with the film. I enjoyed it too, though when it comes to the rating, I should be honest.Maddie, an authoress who lost hearing and voice in her childhood is now living in a remote place, somewhat isolated from the people. On an ordinary day, unexpectedly, a masked man who killed her neighbour, is now after Maddie too. When she comes to realise that, the cat and mouse game begins. She locked herself inside. On the other hand the stranger trying to get in. As it goes like that for hours, so many twists and turns take place. How the remaining tale would turn out is should be watched.Simpleness was the highlight. They did not try too much. Particularly, for a thriller like this, they usually scare the viewers with sudden and loud sounds. This film had those, but minimised. You can't blame for isolated settings too, because such crimes can be easily committed on those backdrops. It's all about Kate Siegel. Her best film, according to me. Nice direction, from one of the latest horror flick maker. But this is not a horror film. It is a terror, a thriller. Short running time and it is worth a try.6/10"

With that aside I have to admit this film left me literally seething with rage. The protagonist is so incredibly inept as she has multiple chances where she could objectively escape or defeat the antagonist, yet she never does. Throughout the film she becomes more and more worn down but interspersed through random points she just gets massive adrenaline boosts for little to no reason and performs dexterous feats that normal non-injured human beings would never be able to accomplish. For a point in the movie she spends what feels like hours fumbling trying to load a crossbow, even though in this time she is supposed to be getting weaker all of a sudden, BOOM! The crossbow is loaded off-screen, no explanation, no point, just... BECAUSE. She consistently fails to use any of the tools she has at her disposal until the very end of the film, not because she gained access to them, not because she gained insight into the weaknesses of her enemy, but just because otherwise she would have gotten rid of him five minutes in. If you have a critical eye this movie is extremely frustrating to watch, it may be entertaining for some, but for me it was more upsetting than anything else."
" A competent and confident thriller that does exactly what it sets out to but not much more.
",0.4497,0.9721,2017-10-16 00:00:00,6,"'Hush (2016)' is a taut and often tense thriller that wastes no time getting straight into its small-scale story. It provides several fantastically suspenseful sequences, but sadly struggles to keep up the pace as its plot wears itself a little too thin in the second act. It feels like it lacks a major plot-point or twist to really sell its worth as a narrative. Yet, simultaneously, it does what it sets out to with a confident and swift verve. Its core concept of a deaf-mute protagonist is handled surprisingly well, with the audience never being given a cheat and with most of the picture playing out without any dialogue whatsoever, and the result is a unique spin on an often-seen premise. It actually allows for some interesting set-pieces without, perhaps surprisingly, being pushed to the extreme or becoming the sole identity of the entire picture. The film always stands on its own as a competent yet unsurprising example of a tried-and-tested sub-genre. 6/10"
" What a piece of crap

So, somebody decides to invade her house and kills her neighbors because... hey don't these things happen? So, the invader is wearing a mask and gives emotionless gestures because... John Carpenter's Halloween was a very successful film? So... He can kill her at any point, can enter the house at any point, but doesn't do it because... IT'S A FILM. And there's no way to get scared or give a damn about what happens on screen because you know from the first five seconds what's gonna happen to the end. No need to mention acting (Could the invader's performance be any more clich√©?? And no, that guys looks don't qualify for a killer, nor for a psychopath), no need to pay attention to photography or cinematography when the main idea of a film is purely retarded. How can anybody be scared when in every second of this movie it SCREAMS that ""it's just a movie"". No thanks."

A 90 lb. cute deaf girl is going to move to a remote little house in the middle of nowhere, out in the woods, with only one neighboring couple, which are also gone a lot?????????I would be absolutely terrified if this was my daughter or wife. Not to mention, she isn't some veteran survivalist or gun owner-- just a pretty author who cooks and hangs out with her cat. At least get a damn dog!! Or a gun or two. I'm a grown man with my hearing, who spent most of my life in secluded areas in the country, and I wouldn't even live out in seclusion without a dog, a gun, etc. She must have grown up in a bubble where rapes, home invasions, murders, thefts, animal contact, and natural disasters or emergencies NEVER happen, and so she's quite comfy in the middle of the twilight zone, being a tiny, weak deaf girl with no man or family. It is like hanging a sign around your neck that says, ""Hey, come assault me.""Anyway, the boyfriend from next door believes this guy might be a cop--who looks like a rival gangster on Sons of Anarchy, or the guy in the holding cell when you get arrested. Nothing about him even looks remotely trustworthy, much less a cop. I would not even approach this guy unarmed and stand around talking to him if I suspected anything was wrong at a home invasion. Then, of course, you had to have that stupid moment where the bf realizes he is fake, and is about to bash his head, and then the deaf girl unwittingly startles them and gets the good guy killed.Other times existed when the girl could have ran into the dark woods and hidden. It would have been very hard for him to find her. Trust me, the woods are very hard to navigate at night in a sprawling outdoor area.The dude was weak and stupid(I know he was toying with her, but come on). He also had very little character development as to what or who he was and how he ended up in this area. Her killing him at the end was about as likely as me becoming president.This movie was OK for a modern horror flick on Netflix, but nothing extra. I was hoping for a little more. It started out well, built up nicely, but didn't pull out much of anything you haven't seen 100 times before. Again....women living in the woods alone with no protection, dog, gun, family, etc. while being handicapped---- the worst idea ever. It made me feel like she was more stupid and doomed for trouble than sympathy--from the start. Anyway, the film is watchable and entertaining, but nothing to get excited about."
" Did the director/writer even try to do a TWO SECOND GOOGLE SEARCH before sinking millions of dollars into this movie?
",0.0,-0.757,2017-09-30 00:00:00,1,"Alright, words can not describe my disappointment that this movie is well-received. It really goes to show that people don't bother to do even 2 seconds of googling on topics like deafness, not even if they're writing and directing an entire freaking movie sinking millions of dollars in the budget! First of all, lip-reading is not magic. I had to turn off the movie after the scene where the crazed killer speaks at a normal pace to the woman 15 feet away, through a glass door in the dark!I was already aggravated when the bloody woman ran up to the sliding door 5 feet away from the oblivious deaf woman at the counter. Deaf people learn how to sense their surroundings without the ability to hear -- They are able to sense vibrations through touch because sound is not only perceivable through hearing. They make tactile vibrations that you, yourself would be able to feel if you were deaf. Therefore, not only would this woman have noticed the flash of movement in her peripheral vision, she would have most likely felt the vibrations from the sliding door. When you bang on a sliding door it makes a resonating, almost sonic boom. This writer could have easily done a 2 second google search to learn that deaf people do regularly attend concerts and are able to enjoy either listening to the beats with the little hearing they have left, or sense it tactically if they are stone deaf (which is exceedingly rare). However, I would have been able to look past the sliding door scene because it is difficult to figure that one out, but the lip-reading scene was so blatantly ignorant that I just couldn't give them any more slack. If you're going to write an entire fricking script, direct and sink millions of dollars into a movie then why not at least take the time to educate yourself so that you can make your movie PLAUSIBLE therefore immerse even the most knowledgeable person?I write stories myself, and I always make sure to research every single topic extensively so it really disappoints me immensely when people don't care enough about their own careers to do the same. I have no respect for any director or writer who doesn't bother to research topics they make movies about."

The movie is full of clich√©s and after a certain point it becomes really boring despite the fact that the movie is not very long. I am not going to say exactly what happens because I don't want to give away anything but what you read in the description of the movie is basically what you will get, there is nothing more: the characters are hardly developed and there is very little plot comparing to what is already known from the synopsis and the trailers. I don't recommend it for two main reasons: First of all it is not scary at all at least to those that have some experience with the genre and secondly there are way better movies like this one that are way better from every prospective. If you ask me leave this one and try watching 'Don't breath'."
" Not enough horror movies talk about physical handicap in a serious way.
",0.4015,0.8489,2017-09-13 00:00:00,7,"Unfortunately, many horror movies show physical handicap as a ""light"" subject. It is sometimes just used for cheap one-liners. But ""Hush"" takes a different approach, for the better. Here, physical handicap (i.e., the loss of hearing) is tackled with maturity, in a humane way. ""Late Phases"" did that also, but not as seriously as ""Hush"".Even though the main character suffers from a handicap, she manages to show great survival skills, and an incredible will to survive against an unnamed assailant. Consequently, the movie builds an amazing suspense throughout.This kind of movie is above-average in the horror/thriller genre. This a powerful, dark and creative work of art, that will keep you on your toes right until the end. It's not perfect -especially with regards to the choice of music, or the fact that the mask of the killer may not be shown enough-, but in the end, it's still thoroughly enjoyable."
" made me a nervous wreck

The main character, Maddie (Siegel), has been a deaf mute since she contracted meningitis in her teens. An author, she lives an isolated life in a house off the beaten track, and at the moment, she's working on a new book.A masked intruder cuts off her electricity and terrorizes her.This isn't a horror movie, which is the reason I watched it. It's very exciting in spots, and I was very happy when she finally did what I had been screaming (mentally) for her to do the entire film.""Hush"" is entertaining, but it's full of holes. Normally in any film of this kind, I don't ask for realism, but despite an excellent premise and a wonderful performance by Siegel, it doesn't hold up under scrutiny.First off, why is a deaf mute living in a place with so little civilization? Her lifelines are her phone and her computer and without them, she's without help. Second, who is this guy? We don't know. He's a murderer, and I guess he's just out seeing who he can kill tonight. We get no background. And he takes his mask off too early - it would have been eerier if he'd kept it on.What would possess the neighbor to believe this maniac is a cop?Finally, Maddie and the killer's cat-and-mouse game is strange. I don't know where she was planning to go the times she left the house - somehow that seemed unwise. The killer made some unwise choices himself, and either one of them could have killed the other many times and did not.This film had unrealized potential had the script been better. I do applaud them for not doing one usual clich√© - you'll realize what it is. I give it points for keeping me on the edge of my seat."

I read the synopsis and found that it sounded interesting enough. So I decided to give the movie a go.Writer Kate Siegel and writer/director Mike Flanagan had put together an entertaining enough movie, though this was hardly a revolutionary movie within the genre. The movie was fast paced and well-told, although it did suffer from being generic and predictable, as many movies in this particular genre tend to be.The ensemble of acting performers on the cast list was fairly limited, so there was a bit more of a performance pressure on their shoulders. It should be said that the actors and actresses in the movie did carry themselves and the movie quite well. Kate Siegel was really outstanding with her performance in the movie, and she was the one doing most of the lifting.This is more of a thriller than it was a horror movie, so don't expect to be scared out of your seat. This is the type of movie that slowly sinks in and creeps under your skin.""Hush"" doesn't make much use of special effects or CGI, but director Mike Flanagan proved that the movie didn't really need to rely on such effects in order to be effective and entertaining.This movie is actually well worth taking the time and effort to sit down to watch if you have the opportunity. But I have to say that I hardly see myself returning to watch the movie a second time, because it just doesn't really have that repeated viewing quality to it. My rating for ""Hush"" is six out of ten stars."

It hides its flaws well, and aims for a certain elegance with somewhat minimalist approach that worked so well in It Follows and many others.Where it fails is in presenting something new, anything really. It has some predictable scenes, a start, a middle and an end and that's it. If you've seen a few movies like that, there is absolutely no reason to watch this. Once or twice you get the feeling they'll play a bit more with the main character being deaf or her ability to imagine different scenarios, but they never go anywhere with that.The killer is not scary in any way so any fun one might have depends on the clever ways they try to outsmart each other and any unexpected twists the movie throws your way, of which there are none."

I'm generally a very tolerant viewer, I've watched really horrible movies without much dismay but there's a limit to everything, including my patience. So here comes the reason why this movie is dumb to the point of being unwatchable for me: Were this woman's windows made out of aluminum silicate glass or something??? Or had the guy made a pledge to never, EVER break a window in his life? I mean COME ON! Since when is closing a window or a door enough to hold off a determined murderer? Watching this movie to the end requires a very strong will. Probably stronger than ""the Man's"". And certainly stronger than mine!

Please...2) The guy taking off his mask. This made it like less spooky and mysterious and it took out the ""creep"" connotation out of the equation. Since he is just a random psychopathic dude who has no real personal vendetta or connection with her doing this made the character much weaker and the whole idea of being a crazy killer softer.3) The general fight scenes. Terrible right? the idiot girl had a chance to kill him on SO MANY OCCASIONS and didn't do it because of weakness. Like that time she got the crossbow and DIDN'T shoot him when he was standing in front of her outside the window with a clear shot...wtf so stupid. But then the bathtub scene she is so much pain and at the moment he tries stabbing her she dodges the knife and stabs him... OK sure. There were so many of these idiotic scenes.4) The predictable moment when the guy came around and was ABOUT to kill the guy and that moment the girl comes to knock on the door and lead to his death...Overall, they tried and overall it was mediocre but it wasn't the worst horror movie I've ever seen.

" Review ‚Äì Hush (2016)
",0.0,0.9815,2017-06-05 00:00:00,7,"'Hush' is a fast-paced modern slasher flick with a twisted take on the genre. Well, the twist here is that the lead protagonist is deaf and mute from her teens and the director-writer combo of Mike Flanagan and Kate Siegel (who also happen to be husband-wife in real life), places this character in a stuck-up situation where a killer is on the prowl and all odds are stacked against her. Questions start piling up but a good thirty minutes into the film, the viewer is given enough leads to estimate where the film is headed.A film such as this, where the entire scenario revolves around a minimalist location, one feels inclined to applaud director Flanagan's knack for not making the film look like yet another typical home-invasion flick. The protagonist Maddie's inability to speak or hear is put to good effect in the screenplay. I won't spoil those brilliantly written and choreographed scenes in this review, because that is exactly what puts this flick a few notches above the rest in the genre. Equally inventive and enthralling are those scenes where Maddie's imaginative capability is put to test.The cast (that comprises of just four characters, out of which the film revolves majorly around two!) is adequate as well, and lends ample support to the overall mainstay of the flick. Flanagan's directorial skills, which looked rather unimpressive in Absentia (2011), after which he made a notable Oculus (2013), has considerably improved over the years, all the while sticking to modest production expenditure. Aided in writing by his wife Kate Siegel, the couple seem poised to astonish us yet again this year in the sequel to the strictly sub- par Ouija (2014).Hush is a pleasant surprise amongst the shitload of low-budget slasher garbage that is handed out to us every now and then. It is by all means worth a watch for thriller buffs."
" Horror Genre Fan's First Review
",-0.5719,0.5741,2017-06-05 00:00:00,3,"Okay, so first off, I'm not only surprised at all the positive feedback this movie has gotten (including from Stephen King), but I'm also being rather generous with my rating. This is mainly because the beginning of the killer's terrorizing had parts that were pretty scary. However, after that, it all goes downhill. Personally, I am a fan of slasher movies. I think the concept of isolation and self-defense are interesting and entertaining, if not educational (lol). Having said this, I realize that there is a lot of work within this sub-genre that is also rather sub-par, but can still manage to entertain me personally. ""Hush"" doesn't even fall into that category for me. It did have potential based on the killer's initial behavior, but after that, it just turned into a combination of a movie that just kept dragging on, a Lifetime movie (trust me, I used to watch them a lot), and a movie where I no longer rooted for the protagonist because of her ability to repeatedly make very stupid decisions. At one point, the movie got so ridiculous (and predictable) that I was actually embarrassed that I picked this movie to watch with my boyfriend who is less of a fan of horror and who I thought might enjoy the movie. As users have said, there are better home invasion movies out there. I have yet to check a lot of them out, but this movie is hardly comparable to ""The Strangers"" or ""Don't Breathe"" (which is actually about a blind man whose home is invaded). I recommend those movies or a further exploration into the genre instead of this Lifetime-esque, overly drawn out and predictable movie."

The first 15 minutes or so set us up to understand without any doubt that Maddie's deaf and mute, and then the killer shows up - having killed Maddie's friend and now trying to break into her house to kill her as well. He cuts the electricity to the house, making this a very dark movie (yes, in plot - but I'm talking about the lighting.) It's really dark and you can't see much, so you have the irony that Maddie can see but she can't hear and the viewers can hear but can't really see. A lot of this depends on noises - footsteps, breathing, sobbing, alarms ringing, etc. But for me it fell kind of flat. I wanted something more visual and I found that the movie (mostly in darkness with little or no dialogue) was difficult to remain focused on. In fact, the first time I watched it I fell asleep. I did give it another try and I made it all the way through - but not without some effort.It's a pretty simple movie (one with more than a few plot holes and/or pretty dumb scenes and/or characters) with a small and little known cast and a very simple set. Simplicity appeals to me, and from the description, I thought this had some potential, but in the end it was pretty tough to slog my way through it and it disappointed me. (2/10)"

I disagree Hush is not even near close better than Don't Breath. I don't know about The Conjuring 2, I never watch it and I never will. I watch the first one and I remember don't liking it, I would rather watch Poltergeist than that movie which is way better movie than The Conjuring.Hush (2016) is a solid horror, but I could have been much better if the movie would make more money and it wouldn't be so poor. The problems with the film in my opinion is, it is not scary enough, it is not a scary horror film, it is more a thriller. It start's well but than makes a mistake and goes down hill.The Man takes off the mask and trough in tier movie we see his face, he shouldn't do that. It was not scary, i wasn't scared at all. Have you heard about horror film from 2008 The Strangers? That movie was scary and a horror film, it scared me so hard that my heart was pumping. When a Stranger Calls (2006) the remake was even more scarier than this movie and get's only 5 on IMDb while this movie get's 6 I think it is little too overrated. Actress Kate Siegel as Maddie the heroine was good in her role, but she wasn't convincing enough as the deaf girl she still could hear people.Michael Trucco was in this movie too from One Tree Hill he was killed. I liked that Maddie stood against her attacker she was very brave and fearless. I like the last scenes and fighting scenes that Maddie try's to get away but she find's out there is no escape and when her neighbor try's to help her, he get's killed. I like the crossbow in these movie in which Maddie put's an effort to put the arrow in the bow but the trigger mechanism was too hard to put an arrow. I like the blood squibs in here it was pretty good, in which the assailant shots Maddie in the leg and she can't shout that was really good.The movie goes very fast around, it is fast paced, it is not slowly not boring and it is solid thriller movie. The assailant try's to kill Maddie's cat and she shoots an arrow with crossbow at him hitting him in the shoulder that was really awesome. I love in which Maddie stand's up and provokes the assailant to come in the house and she type's on her computer a goodbye note to her parents and she wrote I died fighting. On the end she stabs the silent in the neck when he was about to strangle her. She calls 911 with the cell and she sit on the porch waiting on the cops. Pretty good movie, but it really cold have been more scarier with the man not taking the mask off. The movie is very good thriller, it could have been a good horror movie.

But our protagonist of the story is deaf, and this makes the movie more interesting, gives an extra plus, but even so is not enough, with a villain completely meaningless and with logical failures, and a simple technique, ""Hush"" is Everything that we have seen thousands of times, but the film, even if it is a clich√©, it does nothing to make us disappoint completely, the deafness factor of the character could be better used, and the killer in question loses the fear very early, The short duration of the film and without forcing it leaves the pace delicious, and the character is very well developed, and the actress Kate Siengel is well in the film, and we even have some nice suspense, but that is lost completely in the course of the plot."

This was an unexpected gem. Expect a quintessential horror film basically! The only thing I could possibly pick at the film about was why would a deaf woman live in the middle of a woods and leave all her blinds up for any possible predator to look in at her? Other than that it was perfectly practical. I love watching a horror film where when you put yourself in the characters shoes you would make the same decisions as they do in the film it becomes much more engaging. Best kind of 'cabin in the woods' style film since 'Beyond the Woods' which I saw at a film festival not all that long ago. If you love this film you'll love 'Beyond the Woods!' 'The Forest' is another great horror movie set in the woods I've seen recently ignore the ratings on Netflix for it, trust me!"

Nothing new was offered in this movie that hasn't been already done a multitude of times before, aside from the main gimmick of the protagonist being deaf. But that's all it is, a gimmick. This element hardly factored into the story at all. Had this been a true POV story with no sound at all, it could've been intriguing. But this might as well have been a hearing-abled person. The writers ultimately couldn't find any interesting ways to incorporate this disability into the storyline. But there were many other problems with the film as well: no real motive for the killer (yes even serial killers have an agenda); clich√©s like cutting the power just as she is trying to call for help; and most maddening of all, no explanation as to why the killer didn't just break into the house sooner. This movie could've ended 30 minutes earlier! Sure it was shot/edited/scored/art directed just fine, but story-wise, there are far better and more original options out there."

Basically there are two characters who ""plays"" in cat and mouse when the prize is life or death. While the premise is simple and many times seen, movie is done so well that it kept my attention from the very beginning till the last frame. Acting by Kate Siegel was nothing short then great - she holds the film together with tight script, directing and editing. Overall, while ""Hush"" isn't anything original or really great, it is a very well made movie. This isn't a horror movie as much as very tense thriller and while the story isn't fresh, it was done very well. Recommended."

" Turn the lights off, shut your curtains and stay Hush
",0.0,0.9236,2017-03-30 00:00:00,10,"I've seen a lot of talk about this film about how it handled the deaf aspect of the character of Maddie. As a partially deaf horror movie fan, I decided that I had to watch this and make a decision for myself and hopefully, perhaps shine some light on the aspect itself. This film delicately handles Maddie's deafness and has done an excellent portrayal of a deaf person. I found this to be extremely gripping and I've found myself in a mildly similar situation; it's almost completely dead on. The way she has been portrayed is not offensive in anyway, and is one of the closest portrayals I have seen to being deaf by a non deaf actress. Our main character is deaf, and can't hear a thing. When she was 13, she contracted a disease that took away her hearing and also her speech. Alone one night at her secluded house buried in the woods, she's clearing up the burned dishes of her failure of cooking, when a sociopath arrives outside her house.What follows is a tense hour and twenty minutes of a twisted, sociopathic game of cat and mouse. We see Maddie adapt as a character and see her develop into a survivor, someone who must stay alive for as long as humanely possible until help arrives. I have never seen such a strong female character in a horror film before. Maddie was absolutely amazing and someone I aspire to be if I ever find myself in such a horrifying situation. She is the epitome of disability does not equal weakness. Kate Siegel did an amazing portrayal of Maddie, and I am personally honoured to have her represent the deaf community in a film such as this. I didn't expect for this to be as good as it was. I was expecting a cheap thriller (this only had a budget of around $1 million) that did nothing for the viewers. I was not expecting to get goosebumps, and to get paranoid about going near the windows of my house, expecting a sociopath to be stood outside, wearing a mask. The gore in this was actually believable in a horror film. It was scientifically accurate, and it wasn't grossly over exaggerated for the shock horror gore aspect, which is always the sign of a good horror film. So much thought went into this beautiful film and it shows, it really does show. This is an amazing movie and deserves so much more hype and views. This was absolutely stunning. A definite 10 out of 10 movie for me."

" ""Hush""- A thrilling and very fun old-fashioned home-invasion flick! Exceedingly well-written and executed.
",0.7897,0.9943,2017-03-14 00:00:00,10,"One of the great tragedies in modern horror is that many of the best contemporary releases in the genre often go tragically underrated and under recognized by the bulk of audiences, while attaining general apathy and dismissal from those who do give them a chance. High quality and cerebral releases like ""It Follows"" and ""The Witch"" are condemned as ""boring"" and ""pointless"" by people who refuse to analyze their themes and deeper meanings. Subversive and satirical films like ""Krampus"" and ""The Cabin in the Woods"" are blasted for being ""not scary"" or ""stupid"" by those who misunderstand their intentions. And excellent foreign films like ""The Babadook"" and ""The Devil's Backbone"" are given barely a token limited domestic release before being dumped onto home video with little fanfare and are ignored by the masses.Being a legitimate fan of all things horror can be hard. You really have to look out for the good films. And even moreso, you have to be willing to give just about every film you find a chance because so many so-called ""horror audiences"" are, well... way too quick to judge and all to happy to denounce solid films for any number of silly reasons. Case in point? Director Mike Flanagan's highly entertaining and very fun home-invasion thriller ""Hush""- a film with a simple but brutally effective high-concept set-up that pays off wonderfully. And yet, despite wide critical acclaim and the film's rampant strengths, it's being dismissed and nit-picked apart by general audiences, like most good recent releases of its genre.We follow lead character Maddie (co-writer Kate Siegel), an author who lives alone out in the woods and is struggling to come up with an ending for her latest novel. However, tonight she is not alone- for a twisted and disturbed masked man (John Gallagher Jr.) appears and begins to stalk her and taunt her, threatening to kill her as he has several others. And Maddie has an incredibly disadvantage... she is a deaf-mute, and cannot necessarily hear him coming. And so, she must rely on her cunning and her creative mind to overcome this devilish threat and try to escape with her life...The film's success lay in its brutally simple but extremely elegant story-line and the top-notch execution that director Flanagan and the cast excel at. The film struck me as quite charming and quaint... almost old-fashioned in a way. It reminded me of other, similar movies from yester-year in a really fun way. Flanagan and Siegel know just how to perfectly structure the film in such a way that it hits just the right beats and never overstays its welcome. It's a very efficient film with just the right sense of urgency and pacing. All the main players are introduced and immediately defined. The action starts quickly and only lets up in a few appropriate key moments to give the audience some breathing room. And every single facet of the story is established and paid off in a really clever way. As far as screen writing goes... the script for this film is pretty much perfect. I could see it being used as a studying tool for aspiring writers and in creative-writing classroom settings. I've seen some people bemoan the fact that some aspects of the story are not explained... but this is just mind- boggling. We learn everything we need to know for the story that's being told. We don't need excessive and unnecessary detail. That would just clutter the narrative and make for a weaker film.The film is quite slick in terms of direction, and I've been finding that Flanagan is quickly becoming one of the go-to's for effective mainstream horror. This is the third film of his I've seen, and he seems to grow more and more with each release. He's confident with his visual storytelling without letting it become a distraction, and he injects just enough style and flourish to augment the story and really drive it home. He never relies on cheap tricks like incessant camera-shake or false jumps... he knows the situation is frightening enough in and of itself. Very excellent work that is complimented by the top-notch lighting and cinematography of DP James Kniest and the dreary tones of composers The Newton Brothers. And to top it off, the performances are excellent. Siegel is endlessly likable as our lead, and she's never too strong or too vulnerable. She feels like a real person stuck in a truly terrifying situation. Gallagher Jr. is devilish fun as our adversary and is a truly slimy, threatening presence. And supporting roles by the likes of Samantha Sloyan and Michael Trucco are ideally cast and expertly performed.It's quite a disservice to such an excellent film that it was never given a proper theatrical release and was instead released predominately as a Netflix film. This is the sort-of movie I'd kill to see on the big screen with the right audience, as we gasp, scream and applaud together. It's a wonderfully made, highly efficient and wickedly well-written film and is easily going to become a go-to for Halloween night viewings and late-night horror-movie marathons for my friends and I. I freaking loved every second of it.There's no other way to say it... I gotta give it a 10. There's basically no faults to be found here. It gives you everything you could possibly want from a high-concept home-invasion thriller, and then some."
" Horrible, Unrealistic, and Cringe Worthy

First of all, the scenario is very unrealistic. Secondly, the girl in this movie is the dumbest, most useless piece of meat I've ever seen or known about. 1st: Yes she is deaf and she fails to notice her friend dying for 1-2 minutes banging on the door BUT she somehow managed to look at her for ringing for 2 seconds. AMAZING2nd: She somehow has X-RAY vision in turn that where ever she looks, he shows up automatically. 3rd: The dead girlfriend's boyfriend first tries to communicate with the girl by BANGING ON THE DOOR AND calling her name while knowing that she is dead. Yeah sure, this makes complete sense. 4th: The dead girlfriend's boyfriend shows up and manages to talk to a guy IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. Who does the boyfriend think he is? A POLICE. He doesn't notice that he has a TATTOO on his neck *uncommon for police* and isn't even wearing a police uniform. The killer says he is the police and says that he is missing his gun and everything. So you expect me to believe that someone also made him naked and managed to find another uniform and dress him up? Yeah sure...5th: The girl manages to distract the dead girlfriend's boyfriend EXACTLY when the killer had a knife to his throat. Does she not have a brain? 6th: The girl has the chance to kill the killer (WITH THE PLETHORA OF KNIVES IN HER KITCHEN) when the dead girlfriend's boyfriend is choking him but nope, she wants to dream about her fairy tales and talk to her imaginary friends. 7th: THE GIRL IS LIVING ALONE IN America IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE WITHOUT A GUN. Did I mention this was America and in the middle of nowhere? Does she want to die?8th: Is the killer immortal? He is stabbed in the hand AND gets a damn arrow in his chest yet he managed to run like Bolt, climb vines and kill a jock, the boyfriend. 9th: After the killer decides that he should go ahead and kill her, he traps her hand at the door. He can perfectly squash her finger up with his feet while she is attempting to close the door with her hand. He has the chance to open the door but no, he wants to have a staring contest with her. 10th: The ending: She turns avatar, she notices that he is right behind her and does some matrix-level moves. She puts a knife in his leg and he just turns from an immortal to a weak 5 year old girl. I guess third one's the charm. All in all, I was disappointed and amazed about how she managed not to die."
" Good idea, poor execution.
",-0.0516,-0.8729,2017-03-02 00:00:00,4,"This movie attempted to put a spin on the 'home invasion' movie type by making the protagonist both deaf and mute. Unfortunately, this idea was not executed well as the movie was filled with genre clich√©s and holes. Firstly, there was no explanation of why the intruder wanted to kill which made the story feel incomplete. Secondly, the intruder reveals himself far too early and simply put he really just isn't that intimidating. Thirdly, both intruder and victim make stupid decisions which really undermines the tension and suspense of the movie. It started off pretty strongly but the tension evaporated pretty quickly and ultimately it was disappointing."

AS noted this review contains spoilers so don't read past this.In the beginning you see two friends hanging out. One obviously def, as they are talking in sign language. After awhile the one friend leaves, leaving the def friend by herself. The girl cleans up her kitchen, and while this happens you see her cellphone ringing obviously she can't hear it, and then you see the other friend run up to the door screaming for help, as the assailant (a masked man) runs up behind her stabbing her multiple times until he knows for sure she is dead. The def girl not noticing starts working on her laptop.Flash forward a few moments and the guy is in her house, taking pictures of her with her friends phone and sending it to her laptop for her to see. Then goes back outside the house. Where she is then able to lock him out. Where he then reveals his face after a few attempts of trying to break back in. He cuts the power and then the games begin.The movie goes on for like another hour of them playing cat and mouse, and it gets old quick.Throughout, you see her make multiple attempts to escape but each time he stops her. The first attempt or two she just has to run back in before he gets her.Then eventually she decides to try and escape through a 2nd story window, she gets almost all the way down before she realizes he is running at her, so she climbs back up, but on the way he shoots her in the thigh with his crossbow.The next scene plays out like she has to worry about bleeding out so she dresses the wound and ties her shirt around her leg to stop the bleeding and sits there trying to think of what to do. Makes sense, except for the fact, you jump a few scenes ahead, and the guy trying to kill her, has had his wrist gouged with a hammer and taken a shot from his crossbow to his chest and was cut with a knife (i can't remember exactly where). So you'd think he'd be bleeding out just as fast if not faster.Eventually, a neighbor comes buy, and the killer tries to act like a cop. Not sure how the neighbor thinks this in the first place as the guy is not wearing a uniform, but eventually he catches on, but the girl ruins his shot at taking him out, because apparently her writing on the window wasn't enough to convince him in the first place.Finally in the end she decides to fight back, and is able to kill him, but not just before she almost dies, calls 911 and it's over.The movie seems like a good idea on paper, but it felt like they were doing everything they could to make it last longer."

She's trying to finish her latest novel while avoiding distractions, such as calls from her ex-boyfriend. But there's someone outside: a masked intruder (John Gallagher Jr.)with an arsenal of weapons, and Maddie has to figure out how to keep him out and then how to escape.Plus Points:1)Screenplay and Direction: Character development is the major pro in this film.We instantly get connected to Madidie's character and her deafness.Mike Flanagan used this point and crafted a brilliant nail biting thriller without any dull moments.He's a rare modern horror director who still prioritizes suspense, and he frames the tense altercations between the pair to maximum effect.All the trials made by Maddie created a tension in audience and whenever the psycho finds out about it,we feel more tense than Maddie.2)Performances: Kate Siegel is brilliant in the role of Maddie.Be it her expressions with sign language with her friend or her first confrontation with psycho clearly shows us that she has a bright future ahead.John Gallenger looked more terrifying especially in mask.3)Duration: A duration of just 1hr 21 min is a perfect duration for this home invasion thriller.Flanagan perfectly edited this movie without any drag.So,Hush is a perfect home invasion thriller after a long time with an engaging screenplay,lot of nail biting moments.My rating 7.5/10 Image may contain: one or more people, text and close-up"
" Worst Movie Of the Decade

With absolutely no information given about the Villain the viewers are left to just assume he's some kind of bored psychopath just waltzing through the bush praying on ladies at home alone. Even when Sarah the neighbor was murdered early on, Maddie may be deaf but she definitely has peripheral vision! Doing the dishes and can't see her neighbour being stabbed 2 meters away through a majority glass door! BS! And with the countless chances for Maddie to finish the Villain but alternatively deciding on some other idiotic venture, not to mention the runtime of 80 mins?

When you wish you're dead... that's when I'll come inside.""There's one thing you shouldn't expect to happen in ""Hush"". And that's the moment Maddie (Kate Siegel) starts to screech while running around, because she's being attacked by an unknown person (John ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" Gallagher Jr.) who wanders around her home in a remote forest. And that's because Maddie is deaf-mute after suffering from a meningococcal infection when she was young. This with a mask equipped deranged sadist tells Maddie he'll take his time and when the time is ripe, he will break into her home and stick his knife in her with visible pleasure. The motive for this maniacal act remains unknown. But there's no doubt that this maniac finds a morbid joy in this sadistic game. Of course, the fact that he isn't really blessed with a significant number of brain cells, does play to the advantage of Maddie. This dweeb makes some ridiculous decisions. On the other hand some of Maggie's decisions aren't thought out either. But her handicap could well have had an impact on her decision powers. So I forgive her that.""Hush"" is a typical slasher in the home invasion genre. Well, there were already a large amount of such movies that passed the review. The question is whether this film uses something original. They definitely used to a large extent the fact that Maddie is deaf and dumb. There are moments when the sound is completely muted, in such a way that we get an idea in what kind of world Maddie is continuously living. A bubble of silence where she feels comfortable without any threats. Until a crazy person pierces this bubble at a given time. But that's it, in terms of originality. The rest of the movie just follows the same guidelines as all other home-invasion movies. Again, a vulnerable victim in a difficult situation and visibly disadvantaged compared to the killer. Initially it seemed a piece of cake to send the frail, deaf-mute Maddie to the happy hunting grounds. But then she proves that she has a tremendous survival instinct and refuses to give up. Eventually the denouement can be predicted far in advance. Despite the inventive concept and qualitatively the film is part of the better slasher movies, there were still some things that got on my nerves. First, the stupidity and the foolish decisions both Maddie and the attacker made. Plain ridiculous sometimes. It also seemed like Maddie's physical ailments weren't enough as a punishment, because most of the film is shrouded in darkness as well (making her partly blind). I know, it all takes place at night in a dark house. So it's quite evident that everything is covered in darkness. Usually this isn't a problem for the film enthusiast. Unless you can't see a freaking thing anymore and as a result it's really difficult to grasp what is happening. Fortunately ""Hush"" only takes roughly 90 minutes to finish. Because, after yet another walk around the house by the man with the mask, I started to become irritated enormously. For budding serial killers I have this advice. Want to scare future victims? Walk around their house several times. Apparently this helps. And revealing the identity of the murderer early in the movie, spoils the intended tension. The moment he drops his mask, the tension decreases rapidly.The most successful scene is the one with Maddie working on her laptop (still not aware what danger she's in) and the masked man entering her home and observing her up close. After that, it's just a typical cat-and-mouse game. ""Hush"" is exclusively being broadcasted on Netflix and is a perfect movie to watch just before bedtime. I'm sure this horror / thriller won't disturb your sleep, like ""Lights Out"" perhaps did. Chances are that while viewing this movie, you'll be exhibiting some fatigue symptoms already.

I decided to watch this film after a night of my friends hyping it up, but this was probably more disappointing than my dad telling me he doesn't love me for the first time.This movie had so much potential, but feel flat in all aspects. While the main character(who I have named ""Mute"" at this point) is in fact a mute, she still manages to outsmart this killer at every point possible. At first, when the killer shows his face and begins taunting his victim, there was some level of shock. However, this factor is quickly drained come to release that he has no way of actually getting into the house. So what does he do? He decides to circle it about 7 times, meanwhile Mute is constantly peering through windows as if he is going to change where he goes somehow. This is the most putrid killer I've ever seen, at one point even handing Mute his crossbow and losing it. Other things aside, the movie towards the end shows one of the biggest challenges Mute has to overcome- pulling back the crossbow to load another shot. And this was the BEST scene in the whole thing, in terms of comedy. The over- dramatized music with fact that victory is so closed to being achieved should be a good set up for an intense scene, but I was laughing the whole time. The whole part was just too laughable because of everything that had happened prior to. 1/10 Horror 7/10 Comedy (Could use some more dialog)"

This time it's a woman who went mute and deaf during teenage and lives alone and quickly becomes the prey of a masked killer. The start of the film reminded me of scream and I knew I was in for a ride.Being mute and deaf she has her own advantages but mostly disadvantages. The first ten minutes are simple but quickly begins the cat mouse chase. Some of the murder scenes are really brutal and somehow they feel realistic which is really scary. Performances are again even without minimum dialogues are top notch. No wonder it's hidden gem of Netflix.As the film progress , the chase goes further which is as usually clich√©d but the elements of horror and the resourceful and smart nature of our protagonist that somehow stands toe to toe with the villain makes it different. As it goesfor the rest of the film , the disability of the main character makes it harder for her and at the same time bringing a more intriguing character development. There's a lot of blood and some heart wrenching scenes involving a lot of blood. For the ending I think we saw it coming but it was nearly the same as I expected. Still , as a proper movie it has all the elements in the right place. It's a nice thriller/horror which great emphasis on performances (most horror movies have dumbest performances) and scary factor. It's good but doesn't break any new ground. I can easily place it within the likes of Don't Breathe and Last House On The Left ....."
" An unbelievable take on the home invasion horror
",-0.4404,-0.9734,2017-01-23 00:00:00,1,"To begin with the good points some of the acting was good and the audio portrayal of deafness was well done but that's about it. Onto the bad. There were so many terrible decisions made by all of the characters I didn't know which to root for by the end. The villain and the victims had so many missed opportunities in their aims of kill or be killed that their actions just became unbelievable. This took away any suspense that other reviews have mentioned and left me waiting for the credits to roll. If you are looking for a decent house invasion horror then avoid this one. Although it has a different take with a deaf victim there are many better films out there worthy of your time...The Strangers, Funny Games, Last House on The Left to name a few."
" Potent home invasion thriller
",0.1027,0.5189,2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"""Hush"" focuses on Maddie, a deaf-mute writer living alone in a remote house, where she is accosted one evening by a psychopath hellbent on terrorizing and murdering her.Co-written and directed by Mike Flanagan, who many have cited as a contemporary horror maestro, ""Hush"" is a straightforward thriller that cuts to the chase. There's not a lot of plot; most of the film plays on the gimmick of the protagonist being unable to hear anything around her (including the noise she makes), which is a clever setup for a horror-thriller film (I'm actually surprised it wasn't done earlier).Comparisons to ""The Strangers"" are abundant and probably well-deserved, as that film pioneered the post-millennial home invasion film as we know it. ""Hush"" reduces the equation a bit, stripping it down to a one-on-one cat-and-mouse game, so in some regard it's a much more intense film; on the other hand, it's also remarkably less scary‚Äîbut that's not really what Flanagan seems to be going for here anyway. It's not a film that intends to scare or get under the skin so much as it is a sparring match between two very different people.The film is nicely shot and there are some fantastic scenes that play on a collective home invasion paranoia that I think we all have. The gore is kept to a minimum, but what is there is extremely visceral. The performances are solid, which is vital for a film that virtually revolves around two characters; Kate Siegel (who co-wrote the film with Flanagan) stars as the deaf Maddie, and is extremely believable, while John Gallagher Jr. plays the anonymous nutjob who is more despicable than he is scary. Where the film does falter a bit is in its last act, where the gimmick begins to wear off a bit as Maddie's situation grows more and more helpless. There is an amicable payoff in the end, albeit a drawn-out one.Overall, I found ""Hush"" to be a relatively well-made film, and an enjoyable riff on the home invasion setup. That said, the film does grow dull in areas, and it also offers little in the way of new ideas, but what it does do, it does with class. All in all an entertaining and fairly intense thriller for what it's worth. 7/10."
" Atmospheric thriller
",0.1027,0.9836,2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Wow, this was a better horror movie than I thought it was going to be. A lot of the time, I choose a film and it isn't scary at all, but this one was. It grabbed my attention all the way through. The concept is different and it's directed well. The acting is also good, with believable characters. The main character is strong and no shrinking violet, which is good to see. I didn't find it predictable. It makes you wonder what you would do in the same situation. I liked that the main character is a writer with a big imagination, and you're not sure where the story will go. It's also interesting and real scary that she's deaf - that is, how would you know if you're making a sound? Good stuff. Recommended."
