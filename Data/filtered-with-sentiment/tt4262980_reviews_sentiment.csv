" They don't understand but Legendary does!
",0.0,0.6854,2021-04-06 00:00:00,3,"My God where do I begin? The design is God awful, just absolutely atrocious and disgusting to look at every minute it's on the screen. The action is so painfully in short supply and when it does come it's completely mediocre and does not satisfy. The humans are the best part of the film but unfortunately make it feel twice as long as the movie really is because this movie is 80/20 in favor of human banter and dialogue. The ending.. my God the ending is a slap in the face go anyone who spent the 2 hours to watch it and insultingly sets up an undeserved sequel when literally the only interesting thing to happen all movie was the one single scene that had anyone talking and that should tell you everything you need to know. Hollywood has it right, they give humanity to Godzilla, make you understand his larger than life presence, and do justice to him in every scene he's in. This is an abomination and another example for me to believe Japan just doesn't understand Godzilla anymore."
" Extremely good Godzilla moments, not so great human moments
",-0.2372,0.943,2021-04-04 00:00:00,7,"While I don't mind movies that focus on dialogue, this one however has too much bureaucracy-talk. I get it, they went for a realistic aproach, the movie criticises Japanese politics... But they could have done it a bit better. Also, I wasn't very satisfied with how they handled Maki's story.The acting was pretty good.The dialogue was a bit confusing and I thought the characters were speaking a bit too fast (especially if you don't understand Japanese and have to read the subtitles). Also, maybe they should have skip the English lines.Godzilla, as I said, is fantastic. At first, his (googly) eyes are a little strange but overall he is absolutely terrifying!The special effects and soundtrack are great. The ending, however, is a bit anticlimactic.And I really liked the final shot, even though I'm not sure I fully understood its meaning (I guess it's another reference to nuclear danger, but it could be something more related to the story)"
" This movie is a masterpiece ... the reboot that godzilla deserves !
",0.6588,-0.4019,2021-04-01 00:00:00,9,This movie is awesome ... it brings what a real godzilla movie is. It brings you down and tell you to be humble and there´s things in life you can´t fight against.A heavy criticism about the government and how lives are lost because of delays in comaannd.
" This is the best Godzilla movie. By far.
",0.6369,-0.8997,2021-03-31 00:00:00,9,"A Godzilla movie made by the man behind Neon Genesis Evangelion??!! Yes please!This is a very different kind of Godzilla film. It focuses more on the goverment's response to the threat than on destruction. The movie is mostly dialogue delivered quickly and elegantly, almost like an Aaron Sorkin film. The strange camera angles, angelic soundtrack and purposely jarring editing reminded me a lot of Neon Genesis Evangelion.Godzilla itself is terrifying. He's slow and expressionless. He's new design and and constantly vacant stare definitely based on the Frilled Shark. His atomic breath is quiet, almost silent, but the amount of destruction it causes literally made my jaw drop."

A tunnel breaks in the bay area of Tokyo. We know who is responsible but for these actors in 2016 a gigantic destructive lizard is a completely unknown concept. The greatness of this movie, a definite homage to the original in 1954, is the director knows how to get the audience goose bumps tingling: with a redux of most of the music & score of that classic, along with the Americanized Raymond Burr version from 1957. Just as much of the action
took place in meetings trying to figure out what the Japanese people are up against in 1954 this movie shows more intense meetings than those from the Cuban Missile Crisisin 1962. The main character is disappointing looking initially but morphs into what we fans wanted to see. The fantastic score from the original is lovingly revived to thrill and engage the audience as we wonder how our hero (?) will be stopped. This movie deserves a sequel to see how Godzilla gets out of this one. I have NEVER seen a film shot like this before and much like the original two flicks you won't see any baby Godzillas, no smiles on Godzilla and definitely no soccer and handball action from the King of Monsters. He's all business."
" A God Incarnate. A City Doomed.
",-0.4767,0.9917,2021-03-20 00:00:00,10,"This Film Is not only One Of My Favourite Godzilla Films of All Time, but it's Possibly one of my favourite Films of all time(Which it is). This film also had some Strong Acting, As-well as some Memorable Characters and it returns Back To Its Former glory as to what its Original Had always Been. Now talking about The King Of The Monsters Himself
Shin Godzilla was an Absolute Terrifying Film, And The Atomic breath scenes were just so Beautiful, He starts of as Kamata Kun, which may be one of the best bois of all time. He then goes into Turkey Godzilla, When the military is called of after shooting at Godzilla, Shin Then returns to Tokyo Bay. Not long after, he resurfaces at 118 Metres Tall. It got so Dymatic with the Atomic Breath Scenes, They were just so beautiful. This incarnation of shin Godzilla may be one of the most unique incarnation of the king of the monsters. His Atomic Breath Can shoot from his mouth, Dorsal Fins And His Tail which has a Skull on it. Fortunately, shin Godzilla is Very Weak At durability and being frozen at the end, with possible future evolutions. Other then that, this film I loved it. Truly a master and my favourite film. And the OST IS AMAZING!!!"
" ""Man is more frightening than Gojira""
",-0.5413,-0.9977,2021-03-16 00:00:00,8,"It's amazing to think that a franchise that revolves around giant rampaging monsters has generated more films than James Bond and Marvel, but that's exactly what's happened with Godzilla. Since rising from the depths to attack Japan in 1954, the big guy has become a cultural icon and fought everything from oversized moths to three-headed aliens and gigantic mechanical versions of himself.'Shin Godzilla' though is arguably one of the highest points of the series. It's a standalone feature and could be described as a loose remake of the original film. The themes feel more contemporary and the Fukushima disaster casts a large shadow, but what really stands out is the fresh spin on Godzilla himself. Picture a Godzilla film where the monster is living through a Cronenbergian nightmare and you won't be far off.This Godzilla is a freakish and occasionally terrifying beast. When he first emerges from the sea, he doesn't resemble his classic look and instead is a wide-eyed, gilled monstrosity. His arms are little stubby things and he's not at home on land, flopping through suburbs and leaving devastation in his wake.And then he starts to mutate. Casting his head back and screaming at the sky, Godzilla's body warps into a more familiar form while blood erupts from his gilled neck. The creature looks a little ridiculous at first, but the more it's onscreen the more disturbing it becomes. This is a Godzilla whose own body hates him. His DNA is at war with itself and it looks as though purely existing is causing him pain.Opposing him are people hamstrung by paperwork. Government officials respond to Godzilla's emergence with confusion, then incompetence. They hold meetings and press conferences, dishing out bad advice and optimistic attempts at reassuring people, but bureaucracy stops them taking any direct action. While they try to figure out exactly how to respond to a humongous monster, thousands of people die as city blocks are flattened.Characters are introduced rapidly and it becomes difficult to keep track of them. This is the film's weakest point, the human characters are thinly sketched and by the time the credits roll, you know very little about them. There's a sympathetic Prime Minister, whose determination to reduce civilian casualties leads to crippling indecision, a Japanese-American envoy whose calculating suit exterior starts to crumble as the body count rises and a rising youngster who is the first to recognise what Godzilla really is. Largely though, they're ciphers for the themes, rather than individuals in their own right.That said, 'Shin Godzilla' is still a very worthy addition to the franchise. There's something painfully real about incompetent officials fearing for their own careers over the lives of their people, while Godzilla himself looks terrific. This time around the effects were created by CGI rather than a man in a costume. I think that all the puppetry effects were removed from the final product but there's definitely a few moments where he looks suspiciously rubbery. As the tortured beast transforms into a towering God of hell and unleashes a jaw dropping blast of radioactive fire that obliterates a city, this seventy-year old Kaiju even starts to feel scary again."
" Incredibly boring
",-0.3804,-0.5256,2021-03-14 00:00:00,1,"95% if the movie takes place in a board room with people talking. Went into this expecting a monster movie, was incredibly disappointed."

" A great movie with evidently lacking budget
",0.6249,0.5043,2021-03-05 00:00:00,7,"This film could have been so much more if it actually received proper funding. The directing is odd but solid, and the cinematography is awesome until... the visuals kick in. Everything in this particular aspect is terrible - the art does by no means compete with its american counterparts, the animations are dull and close to unrealistic, while the vfx and compositing work ruins all that the DoP laid the path for. And yet, the plot and characters save it from being a complete disaster - the coming of a nuclear lizard is presented in a surprisingly realistic way, while politics and society are so well integrated that the film ends up more of a realistic story than a cgi mess. I'll just sum this up with the wish that the Japanese and American Godzilla filmmakers eventually come together to create the true climax of the franchises."
" 2 hours are a bit too much I guess
",0.0,0.9224,2021-02-14 00:00:00,8,"I gave it such a high rating cause I really appreciate the japanese film making. But I thought it was way too long and the missing attachment to the characters didn't make that better... thats something I think the legendary productions do a bit better... but in quality of making its a good godzilla movie :)I think you just gotta have in mind that it's a kaiju movie and not some sort of movie who tries to be smart about itself...
so as the thing it is... I consider it good EXCEPT for the running time... (that should be shorter the next the time)"
" Maybe the most realistic scenario of Godzilla ever but watch in Japanese!
",0.0,-0.8786,2021-02-11 00:00:00,6,"Not like any movie I've seen before. Shin Godzilla brings back the God in a refreshing terrifying way that is very different than Hollywood action movies. The film is mainly centered around nationalism and a country coming together to defeat a enemy while also using their past as a guide. The special effects are still a long ways away from Hollywood but acceptable once you get into the movie. IMO I really don't like Godzilla movements and it's body posture as they seem too stiff and toy like, this excludes his first form which is very reptilian and terrifying. I do regret watching this movie in English dub because the acting was very poor but I cannot speak for the original version. I wish there was more lore and backstory in the film but I guess we have seen that enough for Godzilla so it's not much of an issue. Overall the film brings a lot of good things to the table for future Japanese Godzilla cinematics."
" Shin Godzilla 2016 Review
",0.0,0.9718,2021-02-04 00:00:00,8,"Super heavy in dialogue but not nearly as watered down by bad characters and an uninteresting story like the Warner Brothers Godzilla films.
In fact, Shin Godzilla really brings it on with some likable characters and a more grounded, realistic approach to what / how the government would handle something like Godzilla.
It starts off fast, and keeps that pace throughout the entire film. It keeps you constantly on your toes as the government scrambles for answers and speculates just like the audience would. It's constantly engaging and intriguing as we collectively find out more about Godzilla.
This is probably my favorite look for Godzilla too, constantly growing and changing it constantly keeps the film fresh.
Even some stuff that didn't make it into this film shows how strong this version of Godzilla really is. Please watch and do some research after the film just to see all the craziness that was going to come from this Godzilla."
" Superb take on the king of Kaiju
",0.6249,0.9697,2021-02-03 00:00:00,9,"This was a blind buy - I'll buy anything to do with Godzilla. The trailer looked good, but the film was so much more than I had anticipated.The first half is a slow-burn political satire that builds into a fantastic fight scenario where some of the action had me laughing with joy. I really don't want to ruin it, so I'll hold off and not describe the amazing ways used to combat Godzilla. I will say though, that these techniques are some of the most original ideas I have ever seen in a kaiju film.Ahhh I can't hold off... don't read past this point if you don't want to know. I'm about to write one of my favorite scenes.Ok. Here it is; throwing trains at Godzilla is maybe the coolest thing I have seen in a long, long time. Amazing!"

" Too much time in the conference rooms
",0.0,0.9881,2020-10-29 00:00:00,6,"""Man is more frightening than Gojira.""When the monster is on the screen, the action scenes and special effects are very good, and certainly entertaining. Those atomic rays being shot out of Gojira's back are fantastic. The film also has interesting commentary about the United States and its penchant for unilateral demands and a rash decision to drop a nuclear weapon on the beast (and Tokyo in the process). The overtones to Hiroshima and Nagasaki couldn't be clearer, but the film throws in some heavy-handed references in case we didn't get it, though I can forgive it for those because like the original film, it's making a points about the horrors of the nuclear age. One of the characters states that Japan must start acting for itself and that the war ended long ago, and it was refreshing to hear that perspective voiced.Unfortunately, the film bogs itself down in far too many scenes in conference rooms. At first I liked the commentary that made on politics and bureaucracy, e.g. when the Prime Minister assures the creature can't go on land and then while he's speaking, doh! Gojira is on land. As it plays out it gets tedious though, and there were times when I was hoping I'd be seeing Gojira again. I liked the attempt to show people faced with the dilemma of this improbable creature and how to stop it and the dynamics of power within Japan and the world, but the discussions didn't seem real, like they had a veneer of inauthenticity about them. At one point, a guy unfurls a map on a table and we get fast edits cut together to make it seem like it's some kind of dramatic event. The conversations people have all seem stilted, and nowhere is that more obvious than the character of the envoy from the United States.After a lot of red tape and fumbling around, the film shifts into Hollywood blockbuster mode, with a phased assault on the creature. I like the positive message for Japan, but it just felt too produced, and I wished it had either been grittier and stuck to dark commentary about mankind, or that it had had more action sequences. As it is, it's in the middle and ends up being just OK."

" A great modernisation of the 1954 classic
",0.6249,-0.9689,2020-08-18 00:00:00,8,"In almost every way this film is a remake/reimagining of the 1954 film that started the Godzilla franchise, that aims to recapture the horror and spectacle of that film for modern audiences. But don't worry; that doesn't mean this is just another genrric ""Godzilla destroys the city movies"" - because it's a little more innovative than that.In the politically charged monster movie, Japan's inability to stop Godzilla from destroying the country leads to the UN taking away the country's agency and deciding to nuke Tokyo to stop the monster. Angered by this, and unwilling to allow their country to be nuked by the US for a third timein recent history, a rag tag group of politicans and scientists band together a team to come up with a plan to stop Godzilla's rampage before the US drops a thermonuclear bomb on their country.In many ways Shin Godzilla is the most horrific of all the films in the franchise primerily due to it's ""realistic"" approach the tone and plot. Even moments of levity are often at the expense of either the government or millitary, often targeting their indecisiveness and bureaucracy as a means to highlight how they may be indirectly responsible for letting Godzilla's destruction go on longer than it needed to. In this respect the film offers quite a satirical perspective of the government and Japan's relationship to the US post WW2.But it's not all politics. It's also, as I've already mentioned, horrific.Godzilla is an obsidian colossus emitting orcbid and scarlet lights in pitch black of the night over Tokyo. His eyes are unmoving, unblinking, lifless. He himself in unconcerned. The big draw of this movie is the depiction of Godzilla himself because he has never - even in the 1954 film, and others where he also took the role of the villain - appeared so merciless and cruel. But neither has been so divinely elevated.The orchestra and choir that play over his unrelenting advance through Japan and his destruction of Tokyo is haunting and frightening - it's stellar, and some of the best music I've heard in a Godzilla film with the exception of the original's soundtrack.But if there's one pitfall this music has it is that it is too on the nose. Well... Godzilla movie's have always been too on the nose with their themes and subtext, but as a reimagining of the original I would have hoped for this film to have treated its viewers with more confidence. Dialogue like ""Godzilla is truly a God incarnate"" over his destruction of the city might sound poetic, but it's also dumb and pandering - that line of dialogue is conveyed to us through visuals and music alone. All this dialogue serves to do is to spell it out. Occurances of this happened one or times too many for me to the point where I felt the film didn't think I'd be capible of understanding the themes the franchise has been mimicing for 65 years. This is a shame considering the film is also quite intelligent in other areas.By this I mean it is very creative with its experimental approach to the monster, his strengths, weaknesses, his rise and eventual downfall. How the scientists defeat the monster is unique and simultaneously provides spectacle without it being another big loud battle between an army and a monster. Because of this the finale feels refreshing in spite of still providing some of the noise that the cornier films often rely too much upon.So, overall I give this film an 8/10 because it takes a 65 year old property and somehow does something new with it by being creative and experimental in its depiction of both Godzilla and how people react and deal woth him. If it only had more confidence in my ability to understand what it was going for, it might have been a 9 or 10, as far as monster movies go. I very much recommend this movie."
" Not since the original has Godzilla struck such a cord with the Japanese people!
",-0.503,0.9463,2020-08-14 00:00:00,10,"Hideaki Anno, the mastermind behind Evangelion has reinvented Godzilla for the modern age! Simply put Shin Godzilla is the best thing to happen to the franchise in decades! When release in Japan the film was a blockbuster hit, second only to Your Name.The film received critical acclaim from Japanese audiences and critics, even winning BEST picture! It may seem odd for western audiences but Shin Godzilla brought Godzilla back to his intended purpose, a metaphor. As Hiroshima & Nagasaki, along with the Lucky Dragon are to the original, Fukashima Daiichi is to this film. Simply put this is Godzilla at his best, a manifestation of cultural fears an anxieties in the most monstrous form!"
" Yikes, what a mess!
",-0.4199,-0.9434,2020-08-03 00:00:00,2,"First of all, I was so excited when they said we in the USA were going to get a chance to see this movie, what a disappointment. The DUMBEST looking Godzilla since Godzilla 98 and also, all that ridiculous dialog about what to do. Now, for a slight spoiler, the Woman sent from the USA is Japanese descent, she makes comments clearly blaming the USA for Nagasaki and Hiroshima, last I heard, JAPAN attacked the USA, not the other way around. I feel no guilt what so ever for the actions of the US Military in WWII against either Japan or Germany. Got it? The fault for Nagasaki and Hiroshima falls entirely on the Japanese government and many of the Japanese people of that era, period. Avoid at all costs, a real stinker. Better to watch the old Godzilla movies, the movies they made for kids, at least they are supposed to be corny."
" A new kind of Godzilla movie
",0.0,-0.284,2020-08-01 00:00:00,8,"I am a huge fan of the Japanese Godzilla movies made by Toho as a kid I watched all the Godzilla movies I could get my hands on which sadly wasn't very many of them as it was difficult to acquire them in the old VHS and Laser disk days before DVD, Blu Ray and Online service's made it possible for people to find almost any movie that's been released.Shin Gojira is a very different kind of monster movie when compared to the older Toho Godzilla movies. The major differences being that while the older Japanese movies and even the newer Hollywood style remakes focused more on Godzilla destroying buildings in major cities and Godzilla fighting other colosal sized monsters. Shin Gojira takes a darker and more political approach at what happens when Godzilla begins wreaking havok on Tokyo City.Godzilla is usually the star and focus point of any Godzilla movie as he is literally the title character but in this movie Godzilla is more like a central story arc in a political thriller. Godzilla first comes ashore in a lesser evolved form he's still Colossal in size and begins wreaking havok on Tokyo City but as the movie progresses Godzilla begins evolving into a bigger and more powerful creature that with each evolutionary stage adapts to it's environment and strengthens it's exterior scales to strengthen it's defences against any attack.The main focus of the movie is actually the political storyline that unfolds around Godzilla destroying Tokyo quickly becoming a bigger and more serious threat as the movie progresses. Shin Gojira takes a more realistic and darker approach with this political storyline as the Japanese government have to band together and make decisions on how to deal with the escalating threat of Godzilla. This is an interesting approach to a monster movie as here we get to see government officials and the Japanese prime minister at the mercy of a democratic government for every decision that needs to be made there's a meeting held to discuss and debate all options before they can sign off on the decision.The idea of a Godzilla movie focusing more on political battles rather than actual battles sounds a little boring but there's still plenty of Godzilla action in this movie including scenes of him destroying the city aswell as fighting off tanks, drones and even stealth bombers using his radiation beams that fire from his mouth, back and even from the end of his tail destroying everything in it's path leaving a trail of radioactive fires throughout the city.Shin Gojira is the arguably the best modern interpretation of Godzilla and I highly recommend it to fans of the original Toho Godzilla movies it looks and sounds incredible and is worth any Godzilla fans time.I highly recommend watching the original Japanese cut of Shin Gojira on Blu Ray. The Blu Ray usually comes with both the original Japanese cut of the movie with English subtitles and the English cut of the movie which is Dubbed. The English dub is actually fairly decent and was done by Funamation who are well known for dubbing a lot of Japanese Anime but I still highly recommend the original Japanese cut of the movie it sounds better overall and is the way it's meant to be seen."
" A massive film. Possibly the best depiction of the beast yet.
",0.6369,0.9884,2020-07-30 00:00:00,10,"This movie explodes with awesomeness, realism, and entertainment. It is a spectacle from start to finish and makes for a great midnight movie. There are lots of conversations and dialogue in this movie but to me it wasn't too much. Some of the best movies are dialogue driven with little happening elsewhere. This movie gives us the best of both worlds with great characters and convos as well as epic action and monster sequences. There are many characters and honestly there are too many but it's okay because we don't have to really get to know these characters. They aren't there for us to be connected deeply or emotionally with. They're simply there to act as the ""ants"" frantically planning and plotting in their finely put together civilization while a ""human"" comes stomping through their world. Its a great comparison to see the humans going against Godzilla. More so than any newer Godzilla film and maybe any of them all together."
" Pretty Good
",0.7269,0.4497,2020-07-14 00:00:00,8,"I genuinely like this movie. The destruction scenes are far more realistic. There are a few problems here though. Godzilla moves stiffer than a statue. Godzilla's transformation into his third form has some bad CGI. The story is dark yet still funny at times. There are some loose ends, however. It is never explained how the man drew up an entire genetic map. One mistake I thought was kinda funny was that a character pulled out an image of what they are going to use to defeat Godzilla as soon as they come up with the plan. But overall, it's a good movie that I do recommend to and g-fan."
" A very interesting movie
",0.4576,-0.945,2020-06-30 00:00:00,10,"It is actually very close to the original movie. It has the same plot and everything but with epic cgi program and effects, the movie is great overall and I liked the idea that the characters is actually the country it's self, Japan. Godzilla is a very horrifying, ugly and rotten monster that looks like it was sent from hell! I enjoy the evolution idea of Godzilla being a tadpole thing into a freaking zombie that should have been dead by now. The power that the monster had were extreme! I support the idea and I support the entire movie but it's not the best Godzilla movie but probably the second best one! :)"
" The Fine Line Between Masterpiece and Meh
",0.6808,0.9839,2020-06-14 00:00:00,5,"Shin Godzilla is a film that is so dense and complicated as a work of cinema, it's difficult choosing where to start.It's very clear from the outset of the film that it will be heavy in political commentary, and thus, a myriad of relevant modern day political topics are brought into the forefront. Questions are raised with regards to the post-war agreement made between the US and Japan, the particularly hot-button topic of expanding the role of the Japanese Self Defense Force, suggestive criticism of the use of nuclear energy, as well as commentary on the way the Japanese government operates in times of natural disaster.Shin Godzilla invokes imagery from the 3/11 earthquake and tsunami and the resulting radioactive fallout from the meltdown of the nuclear reactors in Fukushima. In this way, I couldn't help but see Shin Godzilla as somewhat of a Japanese cinematic equivalent to Steven Spielberg's invocation of 9/11 imagery in War of the Worlds. Both films are similar in that, as the tripods are in War of the Worlds, Godzilla cannot be destroyed despite all offensive and defensive military efforts. The emphasis of the horror aspect of Godzilla is also, not only similar to War of the Worlds, but also the original 1954 Godzilla film. Indeed, a lot of effort was put in to this design of Godzilla as it is horrifying when fully in frame.This film has a lot going for it as far as thematic depth is concerned. But it is heavily hindered by certain aspects of the writing, editing, cinematography, etc. that recur increasingly frequently as the film progresses that it can't be ignored.This film is incredibly dialogue heavy where jargon is thrown about here and there constantly. In the beginning of the film, it's fine because that's part of the political satire of the way the Japanese government operates. But it's when things start going into the ""scientific"" jargon that it starts to become a bit much. The problem when you invent a creature like Godzilla that has the potential for unlimited power and is virtually unstoppable is that you write yourself into a corner. All of the scenes where the team of characters work to figure out a way to stop Godzilla feels more like the writers trying to squirm out of the corner they wrote themselves into by the creature's premise alone. We have many long sequences where we have characters speaking paragraphs-long explanations of scientific jargon related to Godzilla's biological principles or how to stop him and it gets very tiring to listen to. At points it feels like it dips into the realm of science fiction B-movie, not only with the writing, but also the acting and the technical aspects of how those scenes are shot.The acting is alright for the most part, though it does get a little over-the-top when the science team quickly deliberate their mumbo jumbo amongst each other. Their line delivery gives off the impression that it's supposed to be funny, as I'm pretty sure there are a number of sequences like those in the Japanese comedy film Virgin Psychics. There is one scene that is probably between 1-2 seconds long that is shot in such a campy, B-movie way of one of the characters saying something like""What!?"" and it honestly brought the film to level of B-movie schlock I'd expect from a director like Lewis Schoenbrun.The editing for Shin Godzilla is another mixed bag. The editing is very fast-paced. It is hectic through the majority of the film's runtime and, in the beginning, it works. There are a lot of cuts and short shots of people deliberating policy and it works to serve as a satirical take on the way the Japanese government operates. But it maintains the frantic style, which wouldn't be an inherently bad thing if it wasn't for the fact that so much of this film is spent writing itself out of a hole. It goes from looking like a clever political satire to an unintentional satire of itself.The special effects are about as scattershot in quality as a splatter painting. The effects look their best when CG assets are looked at with wide angle shots from far away. Unfortunately, however, those good looking shots are the exception, not the rule. There are so many closeups of CG elements in this film which looked like something out of an film by The Asylum. The effects used in the initial attack by Godzilla looked unfinished and incredibly fake. It seems like there was a little too much ambition for what the budget would allow but they went through with it anyway. For a film with an, otherwise, less-is-more mentality when it comes to the destruction and battle scenes, it seems that they really wanted to show little Godzilla running around before he became the big, imposing monster. It looks silly and not in an aged sort of way, but even when it was new.There are a number of audio issues in this film as well. I understand that they wanted to use the original recorded Godzilla theme for this film but its 1954 recording fidelity results in the track being buried by the modern sound design, completely neutering its effect. There are also a number of scenes where there are explosions from either bombs or rockets or cannons being fired that sound awfully low fidelity that, again clash with the other recorded audio from the film. It's baffling how scooped the explosion sound effects are and, once again, it takes away from the experience. It sounds like a low budget affair B-movie.Shin Godzilla is a film that has a lot of potential to be an amazing film. And while it does have a certain thematic depth to it that is undeniable, unfortunately it is diluted by a number of issues that, while small, happen very frequently and repeatedly. I reckon, however, that fans of this character and franchise might find some enjoyment in those aspects of this film since a lot of people go into such depth about how powerful each incarnation of Godzilla is relative to each other and other characters from different universes, but as a standalone work of film, aside from fans of this genre or people who are curious about it, I can't say I feel a very strong recommendation here. It's alright, though in a disappointing way."
" There was potential here, loads of it
",0.0,-0.4785,2020-04-17 00:00:00,3,"Toho does their thing with the famed studio's first-ever complete Godzilla reboot. It certainly feels like a thematic kin to preceding films, with a heavy emphasis on human interest stories and military maneuvers, plus a heavy-handed topical metaphor that clumsily attempts to gaze beyond the superficial story. This time, rather than alluding to the physical destruction and psychological damage of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the mile-high monster provides an example of slow government response and political mismanagement during more recent times of crisis. The Fukushima disaster, for instance. It's an inspired film, with some good ideas (Godzilla's slow metamorphosis from wriggling, serpent-like creature with googly eyes to hardened, lumbering, radiating beast on two legs is particularly cool) but it falls well short of potential. We spend roughly three-quarters of the film in a dull, fluorescent-lit government office, which is just as drab and boring as it seems, and the acting is downright dreadful. Not a lick of charisma or personality to anyone. There's also far too much text on the screen at any given time, with every stiff government suit or slightly-different conference room named with precise, exhaustive detail. Even if I weren't trying to get through the rapid-fire subtitles, that would've been too much. Most of the visual design work is good enough, although Godzilla never quite feels like he occupies the same plane as his human counterparts and that somewhat shatters the illusion. For the most part, though, he's just window dressing. We dart over to see where he's at for a moment, then get straight back to tedious strategic planning sessions. There was potential here, loads of it, but focus is constantly placed in the wrong spot and the result is about fifteen minutes of really entertaining footage amidst two hours of empty dialog and drab meeting rooms."
" Monster v Monty Python (Almost)!
",0.0,0.9855,2020-03-29 00:00:00,6,"I'm really not one for these kanji films, but I do like this Japanese reboot over the couple of American Legendary releases that have occurred over the past few years. The main reason for this is the comedy we are delivered by having this creature feature seen through the perspectives of the political class. Whereas the American films took everything so dramatically seriously, the Japanese (the original creators of kanji films) go for satirical laughs (with a few thrills along the way), but in a very respectful manner.It is quite different. Usually the heroes in these sort of movies are either some scientist who hasn't been listened to, or some maverick military guy/s. But that's all turned on its head in Shin Gojira, where we are taken inside the Japanese Cabinet's offices and introduced to a large cast of mainly male politicians bickering over what to do about the newly discovered beast and importantly, how best to spin it to the general populace. Amusingly, the most accurate information obtained and the most sensible dispensed advice comes from the female characters, who gradually make their way into the story.Apart from that, it's business as usual, whilst this reboot does pay plenty of homages to earlier local versions of Godzilla. So the big guy gets to make a mess of Tokyo, with a somewhat uneasy blend of decent CGI disaster set pieces, combined with deliberately (I'm sure) cheesy special effects. A sequel is almost guaranteed by the conclusion. Fans should go home happy."

" A Unique Take on Godzilla
",0.0,0.9631,2020-03-03 00:00:00,7,"If you are expecting a stereotypical monster movie you will be disappointed. This film is definitely much more of a political thriller than a monster flick.The movie is filled with plain and mostly forgettable characters, however, collectively they make the real protagonist of the film: Japan. The film critiques and parodies a dysfunctional bureaucracy, allowing for some not so subtle irony and other comedic moments using techniques such as extreme close-ups, quick changes in POV's, rapid-fire dialogue to reinforce these while still allowing for suspense when needed. Its overly fast pace is a bit jarring at times, making it hard to concentrate with its many fast and transitionless cuts.Shin Godzilla feels very much like a documentary, with convincing this-is-really-happening atmosphere. The filmmakers really make you feel like a participant and witness to the events happening throughout the film engrossing you into the universe and adding a huge sense of realism which adds to the political side of the film and the impact of the destruction.Godzilla himself is also amazing, the combination of puppeteering, animatronics and digital effects create such a unique portrayal of the monster evoking terror and intrigue. Though, the cgi isn't always perfect, but this can be overlooked.The ending is also a mixed bag, it has a great message of collaboration and ends with an interesting introspection on who the bigger monster is: humanity or Godzilla. However it did feel too cheap and easy which kinda diminished the realistic tone set by the film.The movie is definitely not perfect but its multi layered symbolism and message are so interesting I couldn't help but be invested throughout the whole thing."

I want cheap ass body suits, mother f··· it. But, I will say, the CGI is probably the best I've ever seen in a Japanese movie. I can't make up mind. Urgh! I didn't get the political aspects of the film. Something about a tsunami... I don't know and I don't care to research it so up yours. The main issue I have with Shin Godzilla is the movie is too talkative and doesn't have enough monster action. Plus it is paced like two 90 year olds doing the hunka chunka. I think it would of been better if they just created a new monster all together, but all in all, it's a decent Godzilla movie."

I liked the drama aspects to the movie, rather than making it an out and out action flick.Things I disliked. Some of the soundtrack was awful, especially during the fight sequences. The soundtrack was a distraction rather than an accompaniment to the movie. The special effects was also pretty bad. I'm kind of wondering if that was intentionally done - like to give the impression that this movie was ""retro"" in nature... Think 1970s special effects, and that's probably the closest approximation I can give for how bad the effects were. Godzilla seemed to have googly eyes for the most part! I don't know whether it was meant to be a joke or if they honestly thought the effects were convincing... I also generally don't really like stories with overpowered characters (whether they are the good guys or the bad guys) - unless the power levels are really done in a meaningful way.Still, overall, the movie captured some interesting ideas and takes on how to make a Godzilla movie... Ideas which perhaps can inspire Hollywood to build on."
" A Godzilla Film That Manages To Be Both Satirical And Dark
",0.0,-0.332,2020-02-13 00:00:00,10,"Shin Gojira is another Godzilla film, that much like the first Goji film has something to say.
This is not to say that other Goji films haven't had messages too ( Such as the environmental message in ""Hedorah"") but Shin Gojira manages to capture that same dark spirit of the original.The film satirizes bureaucracy and features several allegories for real disasters that have struck Japan in recent years, not unlike the original's references to the atom bomb.Shin Gojira feels like the first political Goji film in decades, and it handles it all very well. You will laugh at the humor and you will be thoroughly invested in the battle against Godzilla, a Godzilla that is a formidable foe and sports one of the coolest Goji designs ever.Godzilla feels like a genuine incarnation of evil in this one, a far cry from the heroic Gojis that some may be familiar with, Goji hasn't been this menacing since the 50's.Overall this is a must for fans of the series and it is highly recommended to anyone with an interest in well-made disaster movies.It gets 10 Purple Lasers out of 10 from me!"
" One of the best (yet also one of the strangest) Godzilla films
",0.6369,0.9946,2020-01-20 00:00:00,8,"Shin Godzilla is an odd film that does a whole lot of things right, and features some amazing scenes that will satisfy any viewer, no matter what it is they want out of a Godzilla movie. At times, however, the film can be stiff, subdued, and somewhat dramatically flat. However again, though: this is intentional.Let me elaborate. Shin Godzilla is currently the most recent Japanese live action Godzilla film. It more or less tries to present what would happen, somewhat realistically, if Godzilla did actually stumble across Tokyo in our contemporary times. As a result, it is a very procedural, I suppose fairly grounded in reality film. The only thing really out of place, realism-wise, is the gigantic and quickly evolving radioactive lizard).This is both a strength and a weakness, and I think what ultimately makes this film quite polarising. The human story is technically more interesting than it is in many Godzilla films, as the borderline satirical focus on the bureaucracy and politics that would ultimately make fighting a gigantic lizard so difficult is intellectually engaging, but emotionally, not so much. The characters and the situation they're in are interesting, but we're never really invested in their struggles. We're never really barracking for them to live or die. I think this is intentional, and for the most part I have a great respect for the filmmakers taking this approach and really sticking to it for the whole film. But I understand why some may find this terribly boring, and I'd be lying if I said I was thrilled throughout 100% of the non-Godzilla scenes here, a strange case of respecting the film more than I enjoyed it.There are thankfully, however, other elements to the film that are enjoyable, and likely to satisfy any viewer, regardless of whether they come to Shin Godzilla for a fun, destructive monster movie or a more grounded, satirical take on Japanese politics and disaster management. The special effects are mostly surprisingly good, the soundtrack dramatic and used effectively for the most part, the design of Godzilla absolutely amazing and possibly nightmare inducing, and the scenes in which he wreaks havoc are awe-inspiring. There's also a decent amount of action and excitement; I think the only problem for some might be that there are large chunks of the movie where the focus is only on humans, with Godzilla coming and going at some points. Again, a problem for some, but probably not all.This was one of the first Japanese Godzilla films I ever watched, and I since returned to it yesterday after watching about a dozen older Godzilla films over the past year or two. It's interesting how it maintains some of what makes those older films compelling, but also takes things in a very different direction tone-wise and narratively. The focus on politics is more interesting than the human stories than literally all the 60s/70s Godzilla movies I've watched, but it's still not perfect. A satirical, procedural take that also somehow worked in entertaining or emotionally resonant characters may have been perfect, but perhaps harder to do. Guess that means there's room for improvement, but as a reboot of sorts for Godzilla, truly taking him into the 21st century, Shin Godzilla is a fascinating, sometimes exciting, sometimes (intentionally) dull but ultimately rewarding and memorable new direction for the franchise. I eagerly await seeing what Toho does next with everybody's favourite radioactive lizard."

Not only because it is an author signature film, but because it is the closest the audience will ever be from a live action version of Neon Genesis Evangelion.Shin Gojira is a complex film. A commentary on the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, and later a remainder of the nuclear attacks on japanese ground from the United States of America during World War II, and also the political impositions regarding world stability. Nevertheless, the film feels slow-paced due to some budget sins:1) A short OST, which remixes Shin Seiki Evangelion (1995) tracks like ""Bataille Decisive"" by Shiro Sagisu for such a long Epic like this.2) Old Gainax and Toho sound effects as well as lack of these effects in major scenes.3) Extremely long dialogues and on-screen subtitles.

In other words, it's more of the same from a company that's been all too happy to scavenge new spectacles from the carcasses of its most beloved classics.
At the same time, it's also so much less.With the success of the 2014 Godzilla movie, which was mixed with fans and critics, Toho deicded to... Also make something different. But ""Shin Godzilla"" is different - ""Shin Godzilla"" is worse. Much worse. This isn't an echo, it's a stain. A zombified modern clone of the studio's first original kaiju movie.

",0.0,-0.5878,2019-10-20 00:00:00,9,"I've always been a fan of Gojira/Godzilla, and I was pleasantly surprised at this film. It has a lot going for it, mainly a new concept on the ""what-if"" scenario, and for the most part, Shin Gojira/Godzilla: Resurgence, succeeds.First, the pluses, of which there were many. The cinematography was good, the special effects were much better than in the previous versions, and the overall new look of Godzilla from tail to full-blown reincarnation of the famous monster was well done.Additional pluses for the snappy dialogue--the scene where the scientists are included and told what to do is really funny as well as attention-getting--and, overall, the film does a wonderful job of satirizing Japanese bureaucracy and the total incompetency displayed by the politicians. If you're not familiar with Japanese culture, then this will be a revelation. (Although with bureacracies worldwide, incompetency sort of comes with the position).Yes, it's been done before, but here...excellent. Odd to see purple laser rays coming not only from Gojira's mouth--and its lower jaw splitting apart--but also from its back and tail, but that's the newest version, and once again, to this viewer, it's a welcome change.Fair warning: if you're expecting to see knockdown, drag-out fights between giant kaiju, you're going to be disappoint, son. While there are some dynamic action sequences, the film examines the often boneheaded responses of the government more than it focuses on action, although there is enough of that.If there's one weak point, then it's the acting of the nominal star, Satomi Ishihara. The other actors/actresses are just fine in their roles, but as for Ms. Ishihara, while she's pretty enough, her English is horribly stilted and her intonation is poor.She's supposed to have lived in the US for a time, but listening to her try to speak English was painful, and overall, her character is annoying. However, that's the only drawback of this latest take on the giant, ravaging lizard. If you're into new takes on old greats, then this film is highly recommended."

Acting seems robotic. Roles of people that seem like robots, appear uniform and alike. No individual storylines exist for characters. The sole story, is about an event which begins to unfold very suddenly. The drama isn't felt at all by the viewer though, until at least an hour into the film.Once this point is crossed, decision making in the film, and greater emotions, liven proceedings a little. This stops the viewer falling asleep. The ending is better than the beginning, displaying an ""okay"" climax. Nothing special still ...Overall, far too basic and dull storyline to be relatable, believable, or remotely worth a watch.GenreThe billed genre on IMDb is (Action, Adventure, Drama).
The opening displays scenes, intended to convey action and excitement. Instead, they educate on poor effects and surrealism. It feels like anything but all it's genre keywords. IMDb could've picked ( Lullaby, Gaming and Mythological) to be equally as valid.
After a little while, a few moments gave a comedy impression. This isn't what the film is billed for though.Probably just me, laughing at the dire acting...Despite events, the film is certainly not a horror, and poor effects detract from any clear genre working.CharactersVery dull and boring, with no individual personalities coming through. By the end, a few distinct characters could be seen, feels too little, too late.MusicNone in the opening scenes. No camera effects to compensate. Eventually music began after mass destruction began to occur. Whilst this was the correct theme of music, it really didn't increase tension enough.

This is a monster movie where the monster is more laughable (but seemingly only partially intentionally so) than scary for most of its limited screen time, and actually falls asleep for a significant part of the film.What it is instead, is some sort of satire of Japanese politics, with long expositions about undue American influence and veiled threats to the Chinese that Japan is a peaceful county, but if pushed, etc. etc.I think it's meant to be a comedy, but devoid of any cultural context, 90% of it seems to be young angry people in gray suits telling old tired people in gray suits to take action. I think there's a reason why there's not many films about the democratic process - long, interminable meetings on film are about as exciting as such meetings in real life. It's as if Independence Day had devoted itself to depicting people taking minutes of things being blown up rather than showing CGI footage of things being blown up.More entertainingly, parts of the movie are in what they somewhat optimistically considered to be fluent English - particularly by a supposedly American Japanese actress whose mangled English was only matched by her total self-belief in her English ability. However, the anyway somewhat mild amusement of this was negated by the fact that most of the 'English' was actually so incomprehensible that I couldn't understand a word of it and the subtitles only worked for the Japanese parts.I genuinely don't know what the point of this is. If you're Japanese, this may well be one of the best films in existence - and it's certainly got a lot of good reviews. However, given my somewhat negligible interest in the workings of Japanese constitutional democracy, I - like Godzilla itself - switched off before the end."
" ""Shin Gojira"" = Toho's innovative and terrifying-transformation turning Godzilla into modern-Day horror icon.
",-0.2023,0.9857,2019-06-14 00:00:00,9,"'Shin Godzilla' originally produced by Toho in Japan circa2016 is a genuinely terrifying Cinematic resurgence for Godzilla/'Gojira' Once again embodying the devastatingly unpredictable-uncontrollable 'force-of-nature' much closer in Spirit to the Classic 1954 version but perhaps even more frightening! 'Shin' Gojira's modern Day unstoppable wrath is now attributed to humanity's reckless experimentation with accelerated genetic-splicing & unnatural GMO hyper-manipulations plus the continued environmental degradation by way of Nuclear power-plants gone awry.'Shin' Gojira incessantly 'grows' and continually adapts becoming massively hyper-threatening (and even quite grotesque) manifesting uncanny genetic evolutionary regeneration capabilities overcoming any challenges almost instantaneously after being directly attacked (these accelerated evolutionary adjustments prove devastatingly effective against any man-made arsenals aimed in its direction)..... each militarized attack causes Shin Gojira to become even more massive and hyper-weaponized than ever before!'Shin Gojira' is extremely different compared to previous Godzilla incarnations we have come to know and love = much more gruesome in appearance with heavily-lesioned, disfigured bone-chilling appendages that seem like mini-mutations grafted onto Gojira's body & tail. Fans of the iconic 'Godzilla' of old might be a bit startled by the ultra-grotesque visage of 'Shin Gojira' with 'soulless' eyes but there is still ample pathos in 'Shin Gojira's one-of-a-kind resonant Roar.... an eternally poignant cry of pain & annoyance only audible whenever he is under direct attack.....The 2016 film 'Shin Gojira' reflects a near perfect combination of terrifying + fascinating but also has lighter moments when the overly bureaucratic Japanese Government immediately springs into boundless 'inaction' and or procrastination constantly debating options on how best to handle Gojira but not finding any effective means to do so throughout most of this film...... although the scenes of Japanese Defense Forces directly confronting 'Shin-Gojira' (with missile-laden helicopters, etc.) are very impressive and quite exciting. These 'battle' scenes providing a genuine adrenaline rush (appearing very much like a big Hollywood cinematic outing but on a much smaller budget!)Bottom-line = 'Shin Gojira' was a boldly artistic move by Toho (circa2016) to propel the Godzilla mythos towards a new direction (more realistic scientific + horror-based perhaps) it is interesting to ponder whether this more 'radical' artistic direction for our beloved ' Gojira' could have proved more successful at the US box office also, based on the mediocre Box office performance of the current 'Godzilla King of the Monsters' (I happen to appreciate both films, but the current 'King of Monsters' did not seem able to generate the necessary general audience excitement, maybe someday the more innovative 'Shin Godzilla' scenario will have an official Hollywood introduction = food for Cinematic thought!Note: although I am betting next year's 'Kong' plus Godzilla will make a much bigger box-office splash!

" Proper mix of unsettling and terrifying in a giant monster movie
",-0.5719,-0.1582,2019-06-11 00:00:00,6,"The 2016 movie revamp of godzilla feels very reminiscent and true to the motifs of the original 1954 film while at the same time having its own unique take. We immediately jump into the action as we are thrust into Japan as they are experiencing a natural disaster portrayed through the monster. Its pacing is fast but well executed to suit the style of the film. Whereas horror based monster movies are involved where build up is necessary to set the tone of the film, the fast pacing of this movie is done correctly to show this urgency to prevent disaster the same way we react to a natural disaster.The monster itself is very unsettling but to the film's credit the monster compliments the film as the way we see natural disasters is as this terrible force that cannot be reckoned with just as godzilla in this film is something unfathomable and just outright terrifying. The actions the characters do feels realistic with a little bit of comedic effect to them at certain points. I appreciate the witty portrayal of politicians working on how to contain the disaster as it feels a little parodical to the way the government works but it doesn't feel preachy and has a natural flow towards it.A few complaints though, the editting can get a bit jumpy at times and the flow of the plot gets kind of hard to follow at times but all in all it isn't really a deal breaker as to me it's still a pretty solid film. The flow is fit well into the scenes with great music that doesn't feel forced but rather complimentary with what is happening.Personally I prefer this type of godzilla where he is in fact a force of nature that is made to destroy us just as the 1954 version was a manifestation of japan's fear of nuclear war. Definitely would watch again."

" Blending the Old with the New
",0.0,-0.0195,2019-06-03 00:00:00,10,"Excellent movie, one that truly shows how different the Japanese vision of Godzilla is compared to the western counterparts. This movie may not be for everyone due to its very different structure and style, but for those who love Godzilla and his many incarnations, this is as pure as the original rendition. In this film, Godzilla is sinister; not a neutral hero, a pure villain and it shows. With a new design that is grotesque and eerie, we once again see the statement piece that Godzilla was when he originally debuted. Sharp visuals and incredible special effects create the most terrifying creature we've seen and while I do you think that the narrative may be different in the eyes of western viewers, this iteration is a testament to how Godzilla came about, his role in our world, And what an excellent Godzilla film could and should be."
" A Masterpiece of Film making
",0.6249,0.991,2019-06-03 00:00:00,10,"Anno Hideaki is a great artist and did an excellent job with this movie. The movie is made for a Japanese audience, because of this I feel people who are not will not understand why it's so great. Understanding Japanese culture, government, forms of speech, politics, and humor are key to understanding this film.You can still enjoy the visuals, soundtrack, and the great cinematography all by itself however there are reasons some think it's boring. Because most people won't know why I would laugh when the government officials pass cards to one another or asking ""who are you addressing?"" If you're not Japanese these subtle things mean nothing to you.That being said if you are very familiar with Japan and the culture/politics you'll love this film. If you're a fan of Evangelion you'll recognise many nods and even certain music used. However if you're none than you'll probably find it boring with some great action at some points.This movie is a modern masterpiece, I recommend it."
" Brilliant reimagining of the Kaiju formula
",0.5859,0.9482,2019-06-02 00:00:00,8,"Let me get this out of the way first, as it's I'm every negative review: no, this movie is not your typical Kaiju movie. If you are here to see things get blown up, go see somewhere else.That said, Shin Godzilla is a brilliant movie regardless. Anno did to the Kaiju movie what he did to the mecha anime: roll it on it's head and attack it from the human perspective. Instead of seeing things blow up, you see unravel the political mess that would come with a disaster like this. It even borders into societal commentary, showing how slow and ineffective the bureaucratic system in Japan, with all it's codes and rules is.
The movie does get confusing at times, especially if you're listening to it with subtitle, but it's nothing a second viewing can't fix, and it's highly worth it.In the end, the result we get is a totally new take on the Kaiju movie. It didn't please some die hard fans of the genre, but it sure makes for a great entery point for newcomers.
Strongly recommend it to everyone, Godzilla fan or not, as long as you come in with the right expectations."
" 10/10 Sometimes, 3/10 Most of the Time
",0.0,-0.9237,2019-05-31 00:00:00,5,"This is a film of extremes. You get sequences that deserve to be ranked as some of the most incredible in the Godzilla series, but which are preceded and proceeded by seemingly unending tedium.It seems as though writer/director Hideaki Anno wanted to not simply focus on what is seen ""on the ground"", but also the procedures and back room politics that go into how such a threat would be dealt with. As a concept that sounds interesting enough, but you have no clue how thin that interest is stretched in what is essentially a 2-hour boardroom meeting. We get shots of absolute devastation as buildings are ripped apart; sandwiched between prolonged scenes of politicians shuffling through rooms trying their best to avoid political responsibility.I know what you're thinking right now. Yes, you, the reader. I know exactly what is screaming in your head at this very moment as you read these words and the previous paragraph; because it is the defense I've heard from absolutely everyone whenever these criticisms are brought up:
""But the film is supposed to be like this! It's a satire of Japanese politics showing how ineffective they are when emergency action is needed!""
I know, I get it. The film made this point *abundantly clear* in just the first 10 minutes - and then it continues making this point over and over and over again for the rest of the movie. I'm sorry, but excusing these boring, uninteresting, and grueling scenes as 'satire' does absolutely nothing to make them any less unbearable to sit through.
Penn and Teller's video game ""Desert Bus"" might be a brilliant satire of inoffensive gameplay in the age of moral panic (not to mention of gamers' need to make games as 'realistic' as possible), but that won't stop the game itself from boring you to tears and becoming more like a test of endurance than entertainment. My point is that whenever people say ""it's making a really intelligent point"" my reaction is ""Yeah that's great. Wish they tried making a good movie instead.""This is something that's actually very common to Hideaki Anno's work: He spends so much energy using a sledgehammer to ram his messages into your brain that everything else just falls apart. Characters, for one thing, are so undeveloped that they could've switched lines around between actors in every scene and you wouldn't be able to notice they were meant for someone else. To paraphrase a criticism once made by Mark Kermode, ""It is a petrified forest of woodenness"". One would think aliens had sucked all the personality from every living human and we were instead watching dozens of automatons trying to calculate the best way to fight Godzilla. The only person who stood out was the American adviser(?) and that's only because she's hot and acts kind of cute.Okay, so that's why most of the film is 3/10. So why is it 5 instead? It is almost completely because of the middle bit of the movie. Without spoiling anything, the sequence from Godzilla arriving in his final form to when he 'finishes' is one of the best 20 minutes in any Godzilla movie ever made. If you are a fan of the series, this one part is why you're watching. For all the critiques I could level at Hideaki Anno, he is never better than when he portrays a concerted effort against a threat. When Anno actually gets around to showing the mechanics and tactics implemented by the humans, it stops putting you to sleep and pulls you right in. The tension builds and builds, and it all leads to a scene that I would daresay call beautiful. A huge part of what makes this part so impactful is Shiro Sagisu's incredible score. The scene on its own would be devastating enough, but with his composition it becomes something more. You will find yourself in awe and mesmerized by what you see.To wrap the rest of the movie up, the film quickly devolves afterwards yet again into boardrooms and endless minutes of people yapping. Even the way they 'solve' the Godzilla problem is disappointing. Again, I don't wish to spoil anything, but what they come up with is so ridiculous that it would've never worked in a million years. There's suspending your disbelief, and then there's a plan that's akin to smothering a giant monster with a pillow. Okay, the actual plan is not *that* ridiculous, but they way which they carry it out is absolutely hilarious, and just shouldn't have worked. Given how they've witnessed Godzilla ""powering up"" his atomic breath, everyone within a mile of him should've been blown to hell, and yet it conveniently doesn't happen this time.So yeah, boring movie, bad resolution, but with 20 minutes of perfection in the middle. What a weird film...."
" A film that remembers Gojira's roots
",0.0,-0.9932,2019-05-21 00:00:00,8,"Shin Gojira understands what Gojira was meant to symbolize, not a badass kaiju hero but the fear and danger of nuclear weapons. He is the sin of war, the suffering, the hatred, and the punishment that follows. In this film, he also allows for symbolism of Japan's own lack of political swiftness and lack of control over their own defenses. This film takes such concepts and drives them over the edge into territory closer to the horror genre. While using CGI and practical effects that hearken back to classic kaiju films, its new twisted version of an ever-evolving, horribly-mutilated, abomination of a monster makes it unforgettable. The film itself follows Gojira's evolution as it rampages through Japan and various groups such as politicians and think tanks scrambles to respond. Some people may not enjoy its cheesy effects or its lack of focus on characters, but unique films like this are a breath of fresh air for me. Seeing that class 1950s film understood and re-imagined in a twisted manner was the perfect way to bring Godzilla to the modern times."
" Wow! It blew my mind
",0.6239,0.5599,2019-05-15 00:00:00,10,"This is by far the best Toho Godzilla movie. I heard about this movie the first time when I was watching one of the trailer reactions for 'Godzilla King of the Monsters'. I was intrigued by the way Godzilla looked and thought I would give it a try. Wow! What a pleasant surprise this was. I was completely sucked in by the story, direction and most of all, Godzilla. He is indeed awe inspiring in this movieThe plot is fairly simple. Japan is under attack by an 'unknown' monster that surfaces from the ocean. The Japanese Government has to deal with this crisis by working its way through the beurocratic chain of command. Will they be able to stop Godzilla? Will they be able to save Japan from being destroyed by this monster? Watch it for yourselves to find out.I've read few reviews on IMDB on how talky this movie was. Yes! It is a bit talky but that was not a distraction at all. Let me explain. I figured out after reading few reviews online that this was a satire on the beurocracy of Japanese Government and how they could not handle the recent tsunami that hit Japan. This background adds so much depth to the story as we can see how the Japanese would have struggled to deal with an unforseen disaster. In the movie, we see that the government officials are baffled by the appearance of the monster from the ocean and scrambles to find a way to stop the monster without causing too much damage to life and property. Everything costs money. Doesnt matter if the damage was caused by Godzilla or the military thats trying to stop Godzilla. This was portrayed very well in the movie. Another interesting aspect was the involvement of the US government in all the affairs of Japan as the Japanese Government tries to make its own decisions but is interrupted frequently by the US. I loved all these aspects of the movie as they added to the realism of how real governments work.And finally coming to the Big G. What a treat it was to watch Godzilla tear the city apart. I have read few reviews on IMDB that criticized the way Godizilla looked early on in the film. But it makes perfect sense why he looked that way. Godzilla takes on 4 forms in this movie. The first form is of a marine monster that lives in the water. We are just shown its tail stirring up the ocean and causing panic and confusion among the public. The second form is of an amphibian. Here Godzilla has flaps for arms, gills for breathing and has googly eyes. I have heard a lot of criticism on the way his eyes looked. But it makes perfect sense since they look exactly like fish eyes without eyelids since he was infact a marine monster. The destruction caused by this form of Godzilla is immense. I loved the way he splashed blood all over the streets as he crawls his way through the city. The third form is when Godzilla tries to adjust his spine and feet to stand upright. This sequence is one of the creepiest in the entire movie. As he cracks his back and makes a creepy scream as the bloody tissue in his jaws is exposed. We can see he starts to develop arms as well at this point. He stand there staring at the helicopters as they try to attack him. The final form, Oh my! The final form was the best. We see the Godzilla in his true form. He moves very slowly from the ocean and makes his way towards Tokyo city. This is where the movie picks up tension. The Japanese military hits Godzilla with everything they got but cant make even a scratch. Finally US steps in to bomb the monster. They apparently hurt Godzillla as he bleeds and is extreemly angry. I love that this sequence is filmed at night. We can see the volcanic glow from the scars on his skin. You dont bomb Godzilla, make him mad and get away with it. Godzilla unleashes his anger with his trademark atomic breath and fire. He does a few more things as he fights back which is just a treat ti watch. And wow! These few minutes were worth the price of admission. I wont spoil it further. This is the best sequence in the movie.We also learn about his anatomy and what he feeds on and whats his energy source which adds more realism to the monster.All in all 2 hrs well spent. I was fully satisfied. My only minor complaint was the final battle was not upto the mark after what we see in the night sequences. The music is beautifully composed. The choice of music when Godzilla fights back is epic. It was very interesting to hear the use of classical music for this movie. Enjoyed every bit of it.Verdict. A 10. I wanted to give this a 9. But after reading the negative reviews on IMDB, I wanted to give a boost to the rating. Hence a 10! Go watch it with an open mind. You will be blown away. There is a very intriguing scene just before the closing credits that will make you scratch your head :)"
" Kicked in the Shin
",0.0,-0.9305,2019-05-13 00:00:00,2,"Is Shin the Japanese word for ""slow?""Heard such great things about this and only saw the newly designed red Godzilla, but damn...I spent $2.99 on this and think I overspent by $15.99. But, this does have one thing separating from others: the movie actually has even LESS Godzilla than 2014's Godzilla and that was my main gripe about that movie!Let's see, and this is just an approximate: I estimate probably 10% Godzilla and 90% people sitting around arguing. If you're in the mood for many, many, like half of Japan characters who debate for nearly all of the two-hour runtime - and not even good debating, but nonetheless, debating, this is the movie for you. In fact, you don't even have to like Godzilla or monster movies since the title character's barely in it.And don't get me started on the hysterically bad CGI. How this didn't just end up on the SyFy channel alongside Sharknado is shocking. One step above the unbelievable graphics, but still in the gutter of quality, was the original Godzilla.The movie focuses on a wormlike, though train-sized creature that makes it to shore. It's so unintentionally hilarious, you can't help but laugh. Mostly, its bug eyes that, though are computer generated, look like they belong on some fifty-cent monkey with cymbals toy. I'm guessing we're supposed to be afraid of it as people are running away. I wasn't done laughing at it yet.Eventually, and in seconds, it evolves into the terror-attack and deathly slow Godzilla. Question: if it takes seconds to evolve, unlike most creatures, why did it stop? Look at Scarlett Johansson's Lucy. As unrealistic as that movie was, it was correct about her evolution rules. (Same applies to her Her film, as well.)Anyways, I just described the 10% I previously spoke about. That tenth is him walking, stopping, shooting lazer beams, resting, starting again and taking his fifteenth break that day. The other 90%, or about 108 minutes, is devoted to people sitting in conference rooms angrily talking over each other, or gasp!, moving from one conference room to another...to argue more.There's also, as mentioned, about 600 characters. Don't worry; in lieu of character development they didn't have time for, they'll make sure you know all 600 names and titles.Sure, when Godzilla's all red and tall and onscreen, he can look good. Namely, when shot from below, upwards to the sky. Then you don't see how fake he looks when inserted into real city scenes.I cannot recommend this movie less. I get it is a reboot of the series, and has the normal talkie scenes, but they went so overboard on those scenes, it's such a waste of time. For once, go to the American Godzilla version for a MUCH better movie.No. The 2014 version.Actually, both are better than this.***Final thoughts: I stopped giving passes to poor CGI ever since 1993's Jurassic Park and later, The Lord of the Rings franchise. Sure, some companies don't have those budgets, so then just dump your ""films"" on SyFy where they'll be in good company."

It reflects the low-brow, vapid insertion of scenes with American actors in the very first American release of the original Godzilla. I can't help but think the decision in Shin Godzilla to do something somewhat similar is another part of the movie's critique of the obnoxious, controlling, and culturally self-centered role the United States plays throughout much of the movie.If Franz Kafka wrote a Godzilla script, this would be it. Highly recommended for Godzilla fans, those who are into political satire, anyone simply into deft filmmaking."

Acting is excellent as well, very believable characters though it was obvious that English wasnt the native tongue of one of the actresses.Godzilla was truly horrifying for the first time. A lot of people seem to dislike his look but I thought it was cool.If anything else, this film shows people what a Godzilla film should look like and it is easy to see why most idiot American film goers wouldnt like it (""too much dialogue, not enough things blowing up, Godzilla isnt sexy looking enough."")

" Lengthy Strategic Planning Sessions with a Side of Monster Mayhem
",0.0,-0.4785,2018-11-27 00:00:00,3,"Toho does their thing with the famed studio's first-ever complete Godzilla reboot. It certainly feels like a thematic kin to preceding films, with a heavy emphasis on human interest stories and military maneuvers, plus a heavy-handed topical metaphor that clumsily attempts to gaze beyond the superficial story.This time, rather than alluding to the physical destruction and psychological damage of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the mile-high monster provides an example of slow government response and political mismanagement during more recent times of crisis. The Fukushima disaster, for instance. It's an inspired film, with some good ideas (Godzilla's slow metamorphosis from wriggling, serpent-like creature with googly eyes to hardened, lumbering, radiating beast on two legs is particularly cool) but it falls well short of potential. We spend roughly three-quarters of the film in a dull, fluorescent-lit government office, which is just as drab and boring as it seems, and the acting is downright dreadful. Not a lick of charisma or personality to anyone. There's also far too much text on the screen at any given time, with every stiff government suit or slightly-different conference room named with precise, exhaustive detail. Even if I weren't trying to get through the rapid-fire subtitles, that would've been too much.Most of the visual design work is good enough, although Godzilla never quite feels like he occupies the same plane as his human counterparts and that somewhat shatters the illusion. For the most part, though, he's just window dressing. We dart over to see where he's at for a moment, then get straight back to tedious strategic planning sessions. There was potential here, loads of it, but focus is constantly placed in the wrong spot and the result is about fifteen minutes of really entertaining footage amidst two hours of empty dialog and drab meeting rooms."

" ""Idealized"" Japan
",0.0,0.3998,2018-11-01 00:00:00,8,"Whereas the original Godzilla had been created as a metaphor of nuclear weapons 65 years ago, ""Shin (new) Godzilla"" was symbolized as a metaphor of the nuclear accident at Fukushima in 2011. Roughly, realistic Japan is depicted the former part, and so is idealized Japan in the latter part.Like ""Evangelion"" directed by the same director of this film, storytelling and direction are stunning as well as casts out of recent Japanese live-action films. On contrary to the real government, imaginary bureaucrats deal with lots of desperate situations caused by Godzilla quite flexibly and decisively to save their nation, independently not helped by the US government represented by a Japanese-American woman.In reality, the Japanese government has exactly a number of political issues piled up on the radioactivity at Fukushima and national security. Indeed, Japanese prime minister attempted to conceal serious matters of radioactivity in his official statement some years ago. These matters include decommissioning of nuclear reactors which would take at least 50 years and enormous cost, and moreover, irreversibly harmful effects to nature around there which shall sustain over tens of thousand years; nevertheless the government completely ignores them. As for national security, since they had only to obey the US for long years, they are currently disputing whether to need rearmament.Therefore this film precisely describes a latent fancy or idealization of the Japanese government. Besides, ""destruction of civilization by a monster reveals humans' stupidity"", such an old-trick plot has become no longer a fiction but rather a documentary."

" Shin Godzilla is the harmonious blend of classic Toho and contemporaneous optimism.

All of those aspects have been incinerated in Anno's instalment, who substitutes typical kaiju destruction with bureaucracy and satirical politics. The result is a sublime resurgence of the titular ""God incarnate"". A colossal beast rises from the sea and starts destroying Japanese cities where the government must form a plan to prevent further destruction. The complexity of Japan's bureaucratic system is fully explored, with several organisations and administrations not taking ownership of the situation. The satirical nature of the narrative acts as a metaphor for recent disasters such as Fukushima and Tõhoku whilst also reflecting on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. The creature itself acts as galavanting nuclear reactor, leaving radiation in its wake. The interjectory catastrophes within the politically charged perspective surprisingly makes for a captivating watch. Suddenly the entire situation feels real, with economic struggles and urban evacuation rapidly taking place. Yet, patriotic optimism is nested deep within the story, with Japanese officials wanting the best for their country. This means relying on other nations for assistance, where any past relationships have been put aside for the greater good. Godzilla itself comes alive through a somewhat archaic animation style, accompanied by classic sound effects. With a violently visceral second act attack of Tokyo that will have you on the edge of your seat. Regrettably, the entire final act felt deflated. The excitement of the atomic rays ultimately left nothing else enthralling, with the political debates wearing thin. The lack of character attachment exhumed a slight clinical aesthetic that prevented an emotional investment towards the story and its white-collared individuals. Fear not however, as Godzilla is back and more formidable than ever."
" Not your father's Godzilla movie!
",0.0,-0.9909,2018-09-10 00:00:00,9,"SHIN GODZILLA is not your father's Godzilla movie.When I first saw the glittering Toho logo at the beginning of this 2016 movie I was momentarily thrilled and transported back to my childhood and my love of crazy Japanese sci-fi movies like Ishiro Honda's THE MYSTERIANS that I saw at my dad's movie theater.But Shin Godzilla is not my father's -- or your father's -- Godzilla movie. Instead, it's a deadly serious and downright frightening modern-day horror/disaster movie which at times extends into political and bureaucratic satire.The story itself is straightforward: monster emerges from water, monster stomps Tokyo, and an international alliance resists.Much death and destruction result as Godzilla morphs and displays deadly new powers of destruction. What makes this a movie to be taken seriously is the focus on the Japanese governments ponderous and not always successful decision-making process. Many initial meetings occur where actions are discussed and hashed over relentlessly. These interminable meetings are dominated by men dressed in suits. Very few women-with some key exceptions-are involved at these levels.But progress finally is made and plans developed for the Japanese to lead an international response with U.S., French, and U.N. support. The complex multilevel response involves drones, bullet trains and railcars filled with explosives, and biological agents.The incredibly violent battle scenes do not disappoint as Godzilla is attacked. Massive urban destruction results as Godzilla's awful heat rays wipe American B-2 bombers from the sky and effortlessly slice through skyscrapers and office buildings.It's impossible to watch this movie without being reminded of the real disasters that Japan has faced in the past including the massive 2011 earthquake (18,000+ dead) and Fukushima incident.When disasters happen, how do we respond? While Shin Godzilla illustrates initial bureaucratic wrangling in the face of massive destruction, we are also seeing an illustration of the perils of disaster response by a country that is fiercely independent and realizes it can't go it alone.Shin Godzilla ends up being an argument for international coordination for planning how we all respond to natural -- and unnatural - disasters. That's a message that many people and governments around the world continue to resist."

" ""Man is more frightening than Gojira"".
",-0.5413,0.8352,2018-08-23 00:00:00,8,"Directors Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi's modernized Godzilla reboot doesn't waste any time setting up the situation, becoming truly a spectacle once the big guy arrives, where he goes through detailed evolution stages that are self-mutated. It's impressively done, ambitious special effects (if scratchy at first), in what's got to be the best looking fully evolved creature design so far. By returning him back to his dominating, menacing appearance with some new inclusions.Just like the original, the classical metaphoric and social tailoring comes thick and fast. Fans of Godzilla will already know the thoughtful meanings behind his incarnation and destruction, but there are also satirical political themes of local bureaucracy and international diplomacy. The film interestingly focuses on the boardroom dramas and office strategies with a wry touch of humor amongst the data overload. There's a sense of intimacy from the competent performances. How it's done is like you're riding it out with them, as what we see is a collective group of cabinet members coming together to see it through, always optimistic and full of hope despite the growing pressure and doom-like circumstances. History does play an important part in their decision making. I admit, it probably focuses too much on the boardroom meetings to get that realistic approach, yet this perspective adds a behind the scenes element to the chaos. Pacing comes off leisured, it intercuts a lot between characters, yet the danger and tension is always there.Godzilla somewhat plays second fiddle, but when it's his time to shine, be prepared to be blown away by the fearful realism and devastating punch of his catastrophe. There's one striking sequence that gives me goosebumps, as the haunting song ""Who Will Know (Tragedy)"" starts accompanying Godzilla as he goes about setting a nighttime Tokyo alight. Glowing beams of blues, purples and orange firestorms... I was in awe, and the sorrowful lyrics of the song is beautifully projected to the visceral on-screen action. I could watch it on a loop. The entire film's soundtrack is a stirring arrangement, including some neatly recycled music cues (Neon Gensis Evangelion) and its shot with such creative precision.Can't wait to see what they do next."
" The Best Godzilla Movie Since The 70s
",0.6369,0.936,2018-08-13 00:00:00,9,"If you can only watch one of the ""new generation"" Godzilla movies, this should be your choice.
It has the heavy impact message of the original remade for the modern day with believable characters (and if you've lived in Japan like me you'll know what I mean) and an interesting take on the genre.
The plot -- humanity vs an unknown force of nature -- is a good one that far exceeds the typical ""popcorn action plot"" of monster-vs-monster movies.
My only complaint is that the CGI for the initial appearance of Godzilla could have been done better. However it's a minor, fleeting annoyance.When it comes to Godzilla movies, Japan does them best. Watch this to see why."

Not complaining I love it.Love the more political heavy scenes while the actual Godzilla scenes drag a bit to me... It's really good, Anno.
...
This film is sure a satire of bureaucracy, but what I like about that is that they still won't paint a direct ""Bad Guy"" (other than Godzilla himself of course) like so many other similar films would just point fingers to the ones on top. Everyone is clearly a guy just doing what they think is best even if it's short-sighted and poorly planned.Also kind of amusing that the guys who solve the problem, in the end, are the reject autists. Not saying that to be mean, Hideaki Anno is autistic (he is on record saying anyone who works in Animation (where he mainly works) almost has to be autistic.) and you can see these kinds of parallels in his characters. Look at Evangelion's Shinji, Rei, and Asuka for example.When push comes to shove those are the kind of guys who are probably going to find the answers, the kind of obsessed people who NEED to find the answers, not for any personal gain but because they won't be satisfied without it.

This Godzilla is great, people complain about how it's boring because of all the bureaucracy stuff. That's because this movie is a satire of the state of Japan's current government( not trumping to offend anybody). Like the original, which was a commentary on the destruction of Nuclear Radiation, this movie is supposed to send a message. People claiming this movie is boring are totally missing the point. Other's main gripe is that this Godzilla is too different from his previous incarnations. That's the point. It may help that they had Hideki Anno direction along side Shinji Higuchi, who both had ideas for the film and they took shape this way. I'm sorry if you don't like it, but, if you do, have a big, hearty slice of Godzilla vs The Sea Monster, you simpering, fish-lipped half-wits. Heh heh, get it?"
" Endless talking, dry, boring. Did not feel like a Godzilla movie at all.
",-0.5283,-0.98,2018-07-06 00:00:00,4,"Some of these reviews are just crazy! This movie is slow and weird, more like a weird giant monster movie without the ""Godzilla"" feel to it at all.The CGI was impressive in some parts, but the animation was horrible! Even when they got it right, they got it wrong. When I first saw the monster I was thinking ""please, oh please don't let this be Godzilla!"" It was like some gross dead fish thing crawling up out of the ocean operated like a cheap Chinese dragon on New Years -- literally. Godzilla's eyes were gross, fishy, dead, cheap, toy-like, and his body severely malformed. Through the movie, Godzilla transforms nonsensically from this mindless, dead fish thing into a manga comic god of some kind. It can shoot laser like beams from cracks in it body with supreme precision without looking or trying. I could go on and on with how gross it was, matched by silly, goofy animation.I think that the movie was trying to say that Godzilla was not a typical giant monster, but rather a demon from hell composed of deformed corpses of demons, apparently sent from hell to bring more hell upon the earth, not as punishment or as a life lesson, but as the opposite. It was like it was in complete agreement with mankind's self-destruction and was here to aid humanity in this process.They stop the creature basically with glue which they say is blood coagulant, but obviously it is not. It is some kind of weird glue that freezes. They have to pump more of it into Godzilla than the total volume of the monster. So embarrassing to watch!Obviously the real monster of the show was the Japanese government which was portrayed as frozen in extremely anemic bureaucracy. These guys would take years of mindless rules and procedures to write the rules and procedures of how to screw in a lightbulb, minus the instructions and forgetting entirely that the entire point is that the lightbulb actually needs to be actually replaced.The acting was okay in some parts, it really did feel like the ministers and the people in charge were a bunch of boring, old hasbeens in a retirement home. By far the best actor/actress was Mikako Ichikawa who played a reoccurring bit-part of Hiromi Ogashira, Deputy Director of Nature Conservation Bureau. Some of the acting would have been better if they were either more comedic, or were not in the movie. Note to actors: Sorry guys, comedy takes a lot of work, and you appeared to be busy with other things that day you were on camera.It was a true relief when most of them apparently where killed by the monster and replaced with some old guy who was just there and not much else. This is by no means satire, more like, ""hey we are going to ruin this movie for you until you just can't stand it.""The UN is portrayed as some kind of mysterious god which must be obeyed or risk blasphemy. The USA is portrayed as itching to drop atomic bombs on the monster for the fun of it. Apparently the US is not aware of Tokyo at all.Some weird, inept ""reporter"" like woman comes out of nowhere and makes a point that she is Japanese at heart even though she is going to be the US president. Pointless, absurd, weird, but at least there is a pretty face on the camera for some reason. She is presented in such a worthless, weird way. I could not help thinking that someone said ""hey, you want to be in the new Godzilla movie?"" and she says ""yeah, sure, what do I have to do?"" and he replies, ""just show up whenever you want to and read the lines if you feel like it, no acting or anything required."" So insulting! So embarrassing!This movie is just no fun. Everything you like about Godzilla is completely missing -- except the music which shows up at the end, after the movie is over. The movie ends in the middle, the last conversation said nothing and should have been edited out. What a complete drag!I am certain that the monster's design was based upon a combination of something the cat coughed up and some nuclear disaster memorial."

Godzilla is simply put, Godzilla. He is a living, breathing creature. This film made it more like this was some kind of Zombie Godzilla and I just wasn't a huge fan. I mean the first time you see him, he looks like a goofy Moray Eel that is walking down, or rather dragging himself through Tokyo. Even when Godzilla finally replenishes and is back to full health, he still does not look like Godzilla. This film doesn't seem to be very serious in the fact that its more of a parody, but it won't be clear right away to the viewer.

I also love that Godzilla was there almost immediately cause I hate it when movies take like 30 minutes before the freaking monster shows up. I always just keep on thinking during movies like that, ""when's the monster gonna show up!"" but here I didn't really have to.

this time the cast are portrayed as meeting members who organize how to kill godzilla . they are great actors and it's cool this time around to see how the japanese government deal with the king of the monsters back to gojira he is different ,massive and his height is supposedly over (389 ft) larger than the colossal titan he is powerful as well which he is now able to have atomic breath on his spines and tail instead of the mouth he has 3 forms at the beginning which is strange and new for godzilla 
the action scenes could be better but since the jssdf (japanese security defense forces) are afraid to destroy the buildings is better of to focus on godzilla after the previous toho installments
soundtrack is really epic as well sounds like from an orchestra or plays one of them can also be heard from neon genesis evangelion also directed by hideaki anno 
again i'd definitely recommend this to those who want to watch the godzilla movies or watch the old ones i'd recommend a few like godzilla 1954 , godzilla vs king ghidorah etc"

It's not about the nuclear bomb dropped on unsuspecting civilians by unstoppable military powers, but a biological accident that goes on and on while political and military leaders stumble and fumble ineffectively and let it grow and fester. The movie plays as a political satire, but the monster itself is very interesting, indeed. In the beginning it looks like a cheap fluffy uncoordinated puppet, but it evolves as the movie goes on, changes as the powers at be can't decide on what to do. The terrifying final form is unstoppable and deadly, but could it have been stopped in the very beginning, by prompt action by the leaders of the country? The American involvement is also humorous, showing that the relationship with the victors of past wars has evolved as well.Bottom line: it was funny and sad at the same time, satirical and science fiction, but it suffered a rather slow pace.

I saw movies before that were overrated in my humble opinion but then I thought that not everyone has the same taste. But for this one it's utterly ridiculous. Maybe if this movie came out in 1950 I could understand people liking it then. But we are in 2018 now, a period were a sixteen year old child could make better cgi's than the ones in this movie. It's by far the worst Godzilla movie I ever saw. The special effects are done by incompetent people. The monster itself, well I have no words to describe how bad that was. It actually made me laugh on how bad it was. Certainly when you see the eye of the monster. That must be one of the worst costume moments in the history of filming. But enough said about the amateurism of the costume designers and the special effects crew. The story itself is incredibly boring. You wonder who came up with this script and how the hell he managed to convince people to give him a budget. I don't know if it is because it's Japanese or so, with their strict rules acting as servants all the time, and with their talking like they are always extremely mad at something, but the acting was painful to watch. You get a close-up from an actor saying his phrase like he's reading it from a paper, and then you get the next close-up from the next actor saying another absurdity in an of course mad way. And it goes on and on until you had every single person in that room saying his bit in the most amateur way. The whole movie is about debating what to do and who is in charge and who is to blame. And this while the fakeist monster ever made continues to crawl through the city. And you would expect that this movie would be over after one hour, but no they had it to make it a two hour movie. So if you're a bit tired I can assure you that you won't make it till the end. I didn't, I fell asleep half an hour before the end and I could not care less."

",0.0,0.9369,2017-11-02 00:00:00,7,"A sign of the times, there is no longer a man in a rubber suit . This iteration of everyone's favorite kaiju is all CGI. In the past, Godzilla has been a metaphor American militarism, environmental catastrophism, GM-Oblivion, Japanese war-guilt, etc., and now, in a very political ""Shin Godzilla"", he appears to have been recruited as an endlessly adapting existential threat designed to deride a stultified, stratified, inefficient, and timid bureaucracy. The movie is long on governmental procrastinating, hand-wringing, and buck-passing, and short on monster mayhem, but all-in-all, it's an interesting addition to the canon. Briefly, a somewhat embryonic (but still immense) bug-eyed, proto-Godzilla drags itself out of the water and levels part of Tokyo before metamorphosing into a bipedal form that flattens more of the city before returning to the bay. Eventually a colossal 'mature' morph emerges from the bay and returns to continue obliterating Tokyo. Not-surprisingly, man-kind's puny weapons have little effect on the monster, who has now 'evolved' highly efficient defense mechanisms that make short work of the sacrificial planes and tanks sent to torment it. After much pseudo-scientific discussion, freezing him with anti-coagulants (?!) is proposed and the race against the clock begins: if the locals can't stop the monster, the Americans intend, for a third time, to rain nuclear fire down upon Japan. The movie pays homage to the original: - the CGI monster still 'could' have a man inside (unlike Emmerich's much maligned 1998 version), the classic roar is heard, and effective use is made of Akira Ifukube's iconic score from the 1954 original. Not a film for everyone - probably not even for all Godzilla fans - but (IMO) a worthy addition to the long running and constantly evolving series (this is film number 31 not counting Merv Newland's 1969 ""Bambi Meets Godzilla""). note: watched in Japanese with English sub-titles"

I literally counted 8-9 minutes. That's more pathetic than Legendary's 15-minute maximum. Next, the dialogue is absolutely trashy. Not to mention, Godzilla has the most half-baked backstory in existence- its a bunch of micro-organisms that bunched together! C'mon! WE want GODZILLA for crying out loud, not freakin' Destoroyah! Godzilla goes through several evolution stages, which is an incredibly weird way to live, and half the time looks like a malformed lizard fetus. Godzilla's atomic breath is...purple. Seriously? Finally this film was so overrated when it came out. You say one wrong word about it, and the even-worser Godzilla fandom goes bats**t crazy!

Not again already! Directors Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi provide yet another iteration of Tokyo's least favorite (but arguably most famous) part-time resident by reaching back almost 70 years to successfully re-image what has made the first film an enduring cult favorite. Just about everything you may recall (or wish to forget) seems to be here. A multitude of actors shouting expository one-line dialog at the camera, public address systems doing the same, quick shots of the monster beating up Tokyo, the same shots of military equipment/models being reused Ad Nauseam, etc. This time the mayhem ends with the Japanese using a biological countermeasure (instead of nuking it and what remains of the city) to immobilize the critter on tip toes in the middle of Tokyo to provide city-viewing completion for Sky Tree (?) and a lead-in for a sequel. The Directors jam pack their movie with convincing scenes (but not for Godzilla--see below) of physical and virtual model destruction that fully fill the wide screen. Unfortunately, the film is also jam packed (beyond the tipping point?) with actors (and a few stray actresses) who mostly direct their bureaucratic speak to the camera rather to each other. The objective is to amusingly underscore the decision-making paralysis of Japan's current governing style (a new law needs to be passed by the Diet before the monster can be dealt with!), but it ends up paralyzing the audience's comprehension of parallel unfolding events. Acting is fine when directed away from the camera. Stunning actress Satomi Ishihara provides a beauty-and-the-beast juxtaposition. Cinematography (2.35 : 1, color) and lighting are very good. Score provides a unique blend of music from earlier films, some re-scored riffs on the same, and an imaginative original score. Subtitles for the Japanese version suffer big time from overkill. The top of the screen contains 3-5 lines that identify bureaucrats and their titles plus the locations of every-changing conference rooms (who really cares?). The screen bottom provides overly-generous line-reading translations that flash by at light speed (serious adult grammatical editing is called for). Signs/text are not translated. Godzilla's visualization is often cheesy or just plain lame. The monster is depicted as a cuddly, plush kiddie toy with puppy-dog eyes in early scenes, and as a highly-accurate multi-laser military machine later on (perhaps a weapon from an unfriendly nation state?). Great fun despite Godzilla's rendering! WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD."
" A missed opportunity

I've seen just about every Godzilla movie there is, from the classic Showa era to the Heisei series to the Millennium films. Plus the Emmerich disaster of 1998 and the 2014 American film. And now this post-Millennium flick.The film is amazingly loquacious. The characters will talk your ear off. When Godzilla isn't on the screen, they can't seem to go five seconds without more dialogue, almost always exposition. Sometimes, it seems like nobody else would be able to get a word in edgewise, it's so packed. And it's all linear, like some high school debate. I can't recall any time when more than one person was speaking at once. Everybody spoke their lines in turn. While Japanese society may admire hard-edged straight talk, other cultures like America appreciate some coyness, subtlety or just a little deception. Even in the heat of full-fledged battle against the monster, I don't think they go 15 seconds without somebody speaking up. The Japanese writer just didn't know when to shut up and let the visuals do the work, forcing the American writer to match the verbosity in the dub. This is unquestionably a Japanese movie, which explains why it doesn't translate well to other countries.There's nothing resembling character development. The characters are the same at the end as they were in the beginning of the movie, as two-dimensional as they come. Nobody has learned any life lessons, nobody has changed or grown. By the end, you barely know anything more about any of them, other than one wants to be prime minister of Japan and another wants to be president of the United States, but they had those goals before the movie began. The actors are quite wooden, more than the casts of any previous Godzilla movie. No real emotion seems to emanate from any of them. No terror when Godzilla is close, no heartbreak when victims are killed, no compassion. They're all basically stonefaced throughout the movie, just mouthpieces for stiff, stilted dialogue. Sure, the older movies right up to and including Final Wars had more than a little overacting, but this is going completely in the other direction. Any conflict between characters is nothing more than arguments about whose theory is right, with no real interaction.Godzilla is purely a CGI construct in this movie, marking a clean break from 62 years of men in a rubber monster suits. They still used an actor for motion capture, although I really don't understand why. It wasn't necessary as Godzilla moves nothing like a human. Good CGI artists, as opposed to technicians, can make completely fabricated creatures move with a grace and fluidity that seems completely realistic. Godzilla himself is completely devoid of any personality or intelligence. He's a mindless force of nature, as he was in the very first film in 1954. Even the Godzilla of Final Wars had more depth than this. For some inexplicable reason, this creature has cartoonish, motionless button eyes with lots of white rather than the slitted, dark lizard eyes of previous movies. But this Godzilla is given a welter of amazing powers to far outclass any of his predecessors. I can't see where the franchise can go from here. If this Godzilla were to fight another monster like Mothra, either it would be a lopsided fight lasting a few seconds, or two equally matched, incredibly powerful beasts would level all of Japan in short order. I'll admit that the effects look good, although not really top quality for 2016 like you would find in Marvel superhero movies, but I've never liked any movie for no reason other than it had good effects, and that includes the vastly overrated Avatar.All in all, the movie is a great technical achievement in the annals of Toho, but the problem is that it's all technique, with no heart and soul, no humanity. It's completely humorless. Even a disaster epic like Independence Day was enlivened by occasional quips from Will Smith. Likewise, even in a heavy film like The Dark Knight Rises, there were moments of levity. Just a little comic relief would go a long way. This film is relentlessly grim and it's ultimately a downer. Maybe that might play well in pessimistic Japan, but give me the good, old days of Godzilla movies that had some fun in them, although some of those did cross the line into just plain goofy. I don't expect to ever watch this again."
" Giant Monster and Biting Political Satire
",0.0,-0.9903,2017-10-02 00:00:00,8,"Japan is back in the game with their very own new Godzilla movie SHIN GOJIRA. Where Hollywood revived Godzilla as a tribute to his more heroic role in the late-showa era ""versus"" movies and the Heisei era, Toho Japan has gone back to the roots of the 1954 original Gojira and crafted a modern thriller about the horrors of mankind's misdeeds, the inaction of a government embroiled in bureaucracy and the impotence of a military in the face of this fiercer, meaner, force of nature Godzilla. .SHIN GODZILLA is likely the first Godzilla movie to focus squarely on the political scene within the government when a giant monster attacks. Past movies have always involved Scientists, soldiers, or civilians focusing on the chaos on the ground. This movies looks into the chaos at the top as we follow young civil servant Yaguchi, deputy chief cabinet secretary (the first in a long list of designations to come). A regular day in the government is interrupted by the collapse of the Tokyo bay aqua line tunnel and mysterious attacks off the coast of Japan. While the aged officials hold fruitless meeting after meeting in an obvious parody of real life bureaucratic process, Yaguchi theorists that the disasters are caused by a living creature. No sooner is his theory shot down than an enormous tail rises out of the water. As the government scrambles but always falling a step behind the escalating disaster, Yaguchi forms a task force of unorthodox civilian experts to figure out how to stop this creature. As the government's tried and tested efforts become increasingly futile, USA sends a special envoy Kayako Ann Patterson with the promise of military aid and insider knowledge to this mysterious creature dubbed ""Godzilla"". The creature is growing, mutating, and taking on increasingly dangerous characteristics. Yaguchi's team is forced to think outside the box for a new way to halt its rampage before the UN deploys nuclear weapons on Japanese soil.Contrary to the trailers, this is not the dark depressing disaster movie that was promised. Instead we are treated to one of the smartest and most biting social and political satires in modern cinema. Right in the crosshairs is the inefficient bureaucratic processes of the government and their obsession with trivial minutia which results in a complete mishandling of the crisis posed by the constantly evolving Godzilla. The satire comes in the fact that the film does not overly dramatize anything; what you see is as close to reality as one can get in an old fashion parliamentary government like Japan's. Each ministry out for itself, passing the buck wherever possible, defending only their own interests. Standard procedures take precedence over unconventional methods. Scenes of the prime minister making an announcement of Godzilla not being able to come ashore, intercut with the revelation that not only has the creature made landfall but has started trashing the town, hearkened back to the perceived mishandling of past real life disasters in Japan.Yet the message underlying this movie is not a strict criticism of the government but an affirming call to action aimed at a new generation of leaders to unite a nation. Where the traditional methods fail, innovation and initiative will be the true weapons of the future. Yaguchi and his team represent this perfectly; outcasts from their respective fields because of their unconventional ideas. Their tenacity in the face of hopeless defeat soon inspires fellow citizens from all walks of life, engineers, mechanics, construction workers and other blue collar roles typically overlooked by a status obsessed people, to come together and stand against a God incarnate.The titular monster is unlike any incarnation ever seen. It's keloid looking skin, seemingly torn in places, gives the impression of pure suffering. Yet his inhuman all staring eyes betray a being devoid of soul. It is as it was back in 1954; a soulless unstoppable force birthed from mankind's sins. The military is powerless, though not for a lack of trying. Where previous Godzilla movies have shown the military in a less than flattering light (cowardly, incompetent, or unable to hit such a massive creature), SHIN GODZILLA shows a military force truly giving their all, only hampered by slow indecision from the top.The special effects used to bring this colossus to life is arguably good. No where near Hollywood blockbusters but amazing once you consider the comparatively tiny budget Toho had to work with. The naturalistic direction an camera-work courtesy of Evangelion creator Hideki Anno and his crew give the movie an almost ""documentary"" type feel. It is devoid of filters, using very natural looking lighting wherever possible, which enhances the realism of the events taking place. Though the cuts can be a bit distracting at times, alternating between rapid fire jump cuts to scenes that look as if Anno left his camera running and forgot about it. Equally distracting is some of CGI compositing on Godzilla and some of his movements which end up more jerky than a puppet's. These are just minor faults though and only an issue to the more OCD of viewers. Perhaps the only thing it does lack is the element of human drama. It is unafraid to show the horrible consequences of a monster's rampage through a macro view of a country's key decision makers but in doing so it does not leave opportunity to get the audience invested in any particular character. More than just a monster movie, SHIN GODZILLA is a smart political thriller that satirizes an inflexible system. Those expecting a brainless action blockbuster will no doubt be disappointed. But as long as one is willing to turn in the brain and appreciate this movie for the deeper more complex themes it tries to tackle, you will find a refreshingly novel giant monster movie which the industry definitely needs."

I just loved it, so much. The scenes without Godzilla; 1/10....Do something, please. I'm so bored. This movie is WAY too long, and most of it is just some boring suits talking about how they're gonna kill Godzilla...Who considers that entertaining? Not me. Decent movie though, but still not worth your time."
" Best movie of 2016!!!
",0.7249,0.9905,2017-08-29 00:00:00,10,"FINALLY!!!! After a 12-year-long rest Toho finally bought their biggest and baddest star back; the one and only, the almighty Godzilla!!!!This movie is a complete reboot, not being connected to ANY of the previous films. I am certainly glad that instead of having Godzilla appear after 30-60 minutes like in the Showa era, Godzilla appears only 13 minutes into the film! The footage being not only from studio movie cameras, but also smartphones, tablets, and dash-cams (a camera you put on the dashboard of your car) was a very unique and interesting change. All in all, only about 3 total minutes of footage in the film is from tablets, smartphones, dash-cams, etc which is great that they didn't make it seem too much like a found- footage movie. As for Godzilla's forms, the first, second, and third ones look pretty ridiculous. The second form with very derpy looking and kind of pushed itself along, splattering blood all over the roads, pushing boats and cars around and up into the air as if they were toys which may have been a reference to the earlier films (1950s- '80s) where toy and model cars were used in destruction scenes. The third form which was all red and still had the stump arms, looked like it was a huge BBQ chicken wing. Of course, they could've maybe destroyed Godzilla at that stage had two civilians not gotten in the way.The fourth form.... holy mother of god, is it awesome!!! It is both awesome and terrifying, with the teeth seemingly growing out of its scales/skin. The scene where Godzilla completely obliterates the skyline with that white beam and devastates Tokyo with a firestorm was both awesome and scary!The actors do a good job, they really do seem like they're in a real situation.DEFINITELY pick up and watch this movie! It's well worth the time and money!"
" The worst CGI ever
",-0.6249,0.7159,2017-08-25 00:00:00,1,"This movie could have been good.. But all my hopes were destroyed after 15minutes of watching it.This Godzilla just looks like he is dying from the start, seriously the CGI made me want to throw up. I don't understand all the good ratings for this. Godzilla just looks like those dragons they make for Chinese New Year. It's plain pathetic, it's eyes looks like plastic and looks totally unrealistic, with no movements. Like it's just a big satire. I laughed when I first saw is face after 15 minutes. There is just too much to tell about this horrible portraying of Godzilla. The moment they said he is ""evolving"" it just made me think of it as a Pokemon.The acting was good and the dialog too and I could have enjoyed this movie if this wasn't for this pathetic Godzilla.I don't usually write movie reviews but I've watched this one because it was 6,8...I was expecting something good but no, be warned this movie is trash."

The best part of the film is undoubtedly Godzilla, and he damn well should be! It was hard to tell if he were CGI or a guy in a suit most of the time, but that's either a sign of great costume design or even better CGI modeling. My respects go out to the effects men behind this magnificent work of art and hopes to them getting jobs on some American films in the near future. In terms of direction and filmmaking, this is most likely the best made Godzilla film in the history of Godzilla films. The cinematography is super awesome and the shots of Godzilla are damn scary, as he should be! The acting from the human characters was also a plus, as the story revolving around the corruption of the government was actually very riveting and interesting. Like, to make the humans actually interesting in a Godzilla movie takes mad talent. Shin Godzilla took home 7 Japanese Academy awards and it is no shock why. Not only is this film mindless entertainment but it is also incredibly moving. More of these Godzilla films should be made. Hopefully the clowns behind the new King Kong v Godzilla franchise take notes from Japan! Let's actually have Godzilla the focus of the film and make the characters engaging."

The other laughable, and not at all believable was the enormous amount of laser and fire our poor little creature could summon up to destroy whatever. By the way just to interject a touch of realistic science his weight to structural strength ratio would not support anything near his size let alone dance about, but who cares. Acting and script were appropriately low quality."

I mean you get served a movie from the perspective of what it does to national security and to Politicians and diplomatic stances. Even Americans get involved (a little bit, though they seem to be fluent in Japanese too) in this to an extent.The movie has all the mayhem you'd expect it to have. But try to remember this is meant to be a sort of Origin story from a different perspective. So let's get physical ... I mean political. Although As you can imagine there is all sorts of mayhem. And while there is CGI it still has the nostalgia to it. Also relationships may not be front and center, but you still get the nature of what people are about. So while not perfect in any sense (that goes for Godzilla/Gojira too, especially at the start), this feels like in the same vain and spirit as the ones made many decades ago ..."
" One of the most boring Godzilla films ever
",-0.3804,0.9888,2017-08-17 00:00:00,3,"SpoilersShin Godzilla is the newest Godzilla film from Toho. Upon watching this I really was hoping for a good film, however I didn't get it. The film has a few ups and a few downs, but a far higher level of downsides.Ups: The upsides of Shin Godzilla are few and far between but certainly present. The new version of Godzilla is a unique, interesting and honestly frightening version of the classic beast. While at time it looks very questionable, normally it's hard not to be frightened by the incredible power it holds. The two destruction scenes it gets are quite impressive, the first showing pretty well how Godzilla isn't malicious and merely a force of nature as its poor ability to stand on the ground causes it to merely collapse all over the place. However the seconds scene with Godzilla is pure beauty, the raw power on display as well as the newer abilities Godzilla features all lead to believe that this film would be fantastic. The other good points include the CGI and the soundtrack.One thing that I don't care for in a Godzilla film that I have to address is that it also has a lot to read into and is very good for critics.Downs: OH MY LORD. The flaws in this film are everywhere. The lack of a main character that I could care about or consider worth putting a movie around or even one that I can remember the damn name of is a big stinker on the film. Unlike previous films like Godzilla against Mecha-Godzilla or GMK, I had no connection to whatever the protagonist of the film was supposed to be. There was a guy sure, but what was the point of him? There was no investment in him, or the female. But that only compounded on the biggest issue, which is how boring the film is. About half an hour in or so, you get the last Godzilla scene for OVER AN HOUR. Now this would be fine if there was a good climax or good human characters, but we'll get into that later. That time between Godzilla hibernating and Godzilla being attacked by humans is some of the most boring media I've ever seen. The political points, the characters, the strategies, all of it felt like unnecessary filler and I honestly fell asleep watching it. That on its own is amazing, the only other one I fell asleep at was King Kong VS Godzilla and that was because I had only gotten 2 hours of sleep prior and was about to fall asleep when my parents put it on.This film is a testament on how not to make a movie. It is boring, it lacks interesting characters, the plot is lame, and one or two good scenes can't save a bland film. This was even more boring than the original Hulk movie. I want to be clear that the lack of Godzilla screen time isn't the problem, but the lack of good spacing between those moments of Godzilla that was the problem. I felt no fear from Godzilla about twenty minutes after Godzilla froze. I expected Godzilla to wake up halfway and continue rampaging throughout the film, making a constant and persistent threat that humanity would have to beat before it can evolve further, a battle between unmatched evolution and the human minds ability to adapt. Nope. It was just frozen Godzilla. It is Godzilla without Godzilla.Then after all that, guess what? We get a climax with a few cool things, such as Godzilla's tail beam and the dropping of skyscrapers on him, but then he just freezes. My honest reaction was ""What!? WHAT!?"" The film was extremely disappointing, and even after re-watching it without the predisposition of it being a Godzilla movie, I still didn't enjoy it. I didn't enjoy The Wolverine when I first watched it, but a second viewing has made me actually like it, the same goes for Guardians of the Galaxy (which was too hyped up for me but after that hype left I now consider it pretty good) and even another Godzilla movie, Godzilla VS Space-Godzilla. This movie didn't do it for me though, I couldn't help but be bored throughout, and I'd also like to note that it's not because it's Japanese and only subbed, otherwise I wouldn't be able to enjoy Chain Chronicle's Anime Trilogy or DR3: End of Hope's Peak Academy.If you enjoy this film, that's perfectly fine, however I think that the prerequisite for a film is that it be entertaining, and I have no idea who can find a movie with no good characters, two good scenes and an entire hour and a half of boring moments as being entertaining.I think people just like it because it's from Toho."
" How to make Godzilla boring......

If that sounds ultra exiting then you will love Shin Godzilla as much as that ""accountancy for the 21st century"" conference you went to last year. The big lizard makes only a few appearances throughout the flick like some over paid celebrity who charges by the minute. The rest of this film focuses on fun things, like the logistics of evacuating refugees, caught in the monsters path and in fighting and prevaricating on the part of public servants and politicians. ""Yay"". Four out of ten from me for the parts of the film I was awake for."
" Substitute the letter 'N' in 'Shin Godzilla', with a 'T' and it's a more fitting title!
",0.0,-0.9913,2017-08-15 00:00:00,1,"Oh dear! Whoever is scoring this movie above a one score, is clearly in need of hospitalization. Someone pointed out that not understanding the dialogue would somehow bias our opinions of this movie - that we didn't understand the concept. Sorry, but I may not speak Japanese, but I can tell a crap movie by it's content (or lack of) and dreadful Special effects. The plot is thus: Monster comes out of the sea and wrecks the joint - the end. The 'monster' resembles a Barbecued Squirrel, which doesn't blink, or react at all, much like the Plasticine model in the original. It does however shoot laser beams out of it's back. Most of the first 50 minutes is taken up by ever increasing amounts of people in blue jumpsuits, in ever more expansive rooms, sat around ever-expanding tables, talking and talking and talking and talking - before the toasted squirrel takes a single hit. Every single line is delivered forcefully and over dramatically, beginning with, or ending with the word 'Sir'. The costumes consist of Jumpsuits or black suits and the hair and make-up consists of whether the hair is parted on the left, or the right. What I find fascinating is the amount of paperwork these people are reading in every scene and what the hell is on all those computers??. I mean, what information do these pages contain? It's a monster attacking, a city, not Al Qaeda! You know things are becoming more serious when the outfits suddenly change colour! The cream suits are sent in to provide a solution to a foe who does not move, doesn't evade bullets, or bombs and is as elusive a foe as a brick. It cannot use it's arms and so belly flops on to buildings. What is strange is the odd usage of English, which breaks out for a few seconds, here and there?? It's very odd. If it were not for the stunning Satomi Ishihara, I would have turned off after a couple of minutes, it really is 'that' bad. The hype this movie has can only be coming from Asia, as we are accustomed to better CGI in the Western world these days. This is as bad a special effects attempt as I've seen since the 1980's. The solution to this boring and laughable saga suddenly arrives during an impromptu Origami session, where maps are used to fashion strange shapes, which suddenly lead to a 'Eureka' moment and a plan is hatched to dispatch the creature. On a plane, high above the city (despite Godzilla shooting down anything that flies), the matter of nukes is discussed, by an actor, playing a U.S government official, who wouldn't even secure a role in an insurance advertisement. He is a simply dreadful actor. We have the copied Japanese version of the rousing Independence Day speech, given to copious numbers of further jump-suited individuals - clearly, things are now at the white jumpsuit, def-com 1 stage. Shin Zilla is surely the most advanced creature man has ever seen and yet, does not have the ability to blink. Surely a strong fan would have caused the creature more harm than any missile. This is simply shocking in all departments and you have only yourself to blame if you waste 2 hours of your existence watching this dreadful movie! I'll never look at a spikey poo in the same way again!"

" Like a Wes Anderson Monster Movie.
",0.3612,0.9927,2017-08-12 00:00:00,7,"Clearly a different Godzilla movie. I was a fan if you will of Godzilla growing up in the 70's (smog monster days). This is a lot different. I would say better than the last 2 US takes on Godzilla esp the 1998 oneAnyways here its better but still flawed. Reminds me in many ways of Cloverfield whatever its called.The good: immediately starts out with some disturbance in the ocean. good suspense there. Action sequences look realistic and fun if you like watching buildings get trampled. once Godzilla starts using his fire power its most awesome. There is a lot of people interaction but its done well with humor and unique fast paced editing. It feels like you are watching a Wes Anderson movie too with careful framing and picture book type shots. There are lots of characters and hard to keep straight but once you do the story lines hold there own. Clearly Satomi Ishihara as the Asian woman from the US has the most....charisma, I can see here being a big star at some point. She steals the show. There is a much more reserved Asian woman as well that is also very cool. Lastly the music is great...much revamped versions from the original . Again here it is like a Wes Anderson Movie. Lastly(2) the references to nuclear waste as well as tsunamis both work well. this is not just a silly monster movie nor an overly serious political social commentary but somewhere in between.The bad: Godzilla looks a bit silly and fake at the beginning before he mutates. The eyes particularly look like dolls eyes...i mean sure maybe that is how fish eyes look and perhaps that is what it started as but you cant help but chuckle esp as it looks like Godzilla lost his fore arms and cant stand up right (until later). Also if you want something like the 1956 which is a straight horror monster movie this ain't it. there is much more time spent on people working to find a way to stop the monster. That is enjoyable in its own right but not for serious monster fans. this is no way like the 1956 version. Lastly the final confrontation with the monster is a bit silly too.Overall: If you don't mind a little bit of art-house style to your monster movie this ain't too shabby. If you want the classic type you is out of luck. At least it ain't the typical Hollywood drivel like the 98 and 14 ones . that i think most will admit."
" Fresh concept on the monster franchise, just badly executed.
",-0.2023,-0.9968,2017-08-11 00:00:00,4,"After reading the rave reviews on Shin Godzilla, I was excited to see this new interpretation of the giant reptiles attack on poor old Tokyo. Within 5 minutes of watching the film my excitement was quashed. The idea of centring the devastating arrival of a 300 foot monster onto Japanese shores, on the political, military and scientific debate of its people, could have really worked. Unfortunately it does not, and this due to a number of fundamental issues in the making of the film, which is likely connected to the films limited budget, sadly.I will list in what my opinion, are the big problems:1. The special effects and CGI are nowhere near today's Hollywood standards, seriously hampering the Godzilla action scenes. The restraint's on the CGI prevent Godzilla from moving during his scenes. He is always motionless when being attacked by the military, almost like a statue, whilst maintaining a very silly smile on his face.2. Don't know whether this is just a Japanese thing, but the continuity editing feels chaotic throughout.3. And sticking on the continuity, half way through the film Godzilla actually decides to fight the Japanese back after being pummelled by their missiles. He glows purple before unleashing a huge firestorm of power from his back, tail and mouth which completely levels a good portion of Tokyo. Burns it to the ground, with a similar impact to that of a nuclear weapon. At no point post this devastation, in any of the exterior shots of Tokyo, can the aftermath of this devastating attack be seen or felt. Tokyo looks absolutely normal, no smoke or fire anywhere, even the area surrounding Godzilla (he falls a sleep after his attack?!), looks unharmed. Admittedly this is again a budget restraint.4. The acting and dialogue are both wooden throughout. Neither seem to catch the expected level of shock and disbelief when the Japanese people are faced with the unprecedented phenomenon of Godzilla.5. Giving the political stance on the film, it is very dialogue heavy. the talking is very rapid. This makes the sub titles difficult to follow, particularly when they are white on a lot of light backgrounds. Not the films fault this one, just a gripe I had.6. With the exception of the classic Godzilla theme, the music is mostly horrible.7. This is the overwhelming issue. Very early on in the film, the 'first phase' Godzilla arrives on the shores of Tokyo, and he looks ridiculous. He has these cartoonish massive fake silly eyes which make it impossible to believe this could be a real beast. Its very difficult to take any of the film seriously after this point. To be fair the look of Godzilla improves drastically when we see the 'second phase' version. It is actually a really innovative design, though still ruined by a lack of movement and again the eyes are all wrong, remaining still, looking particularly lifeless and fake.I feel I have been harsh here, given the limitations the film makers had to abide to (feel i have typed far to much!). I mean in some ways its still an achievement to produce a monster movie on a shoe string budget. But ultimately it was a bold decision to take on such a project with limited resources.Also I believe it is irrelevant that this film was some kind of political satire relating to the Tohoku earthquakes and other nation-wide disasters the country has endured. This film is suppose to be a built around the realities of a giant destructive monster attacking the huge urban populous that is Tokyo city, MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT."
" a tall tail
",0.0,-0.9055,2017-08-11 00:00:00,6,"Viewing Godzilla as a political disaster gives this monster flick a far greater reach and meaning. We laugh as the Japanese politicians failing to take control, but feel for the city under threat. This is a Godzilla film at heart, and the effects of Tokyo being laid waste district by district are well shot, as are the attempts to do battle. But the heroes are politicians, scientists and firm noodles. (Much of the humour is on screen text, so if you don't like subtitles then give it a miss)But the joke is very much on us, as we realise that the monster is our own decisions come to life, and Donald Trump could indeed destroy Tokyo through a stupid decision."
" Godzilla rises again, but summons little awe
",0.0,0.7417,2017-08-09 00:00:00,5,"Godzilla is the embodiment of nuclear destruction that can bring a nation to its knees. Everything about the Godzilla story is universal and never personal. Japan's latest resurrection of its immortal icon, inevitably summons all the themes and mythology associated with him, but is it great film making? No.There is a bit of an acquired taste to this kind of movie. Most noticeably, there are no primary characters, only secondary ones. We have a large handful of bureaucratic, military and scientific individuals that collectively represent Japan and its ideologies. Aside from one peppy diplomat with eyelashes as sharp as her tongue, nobody is all that memorable. From a technical standpoint the writing does have its strengths. The war against Godzilla takes place far less often in the field than it does in the boardrooms of government offices, where rapid fire banter is exchanged about everything from evacuations to international relationships. If you plan to watch this with subs, you'd better be a fast reader. The movie, like all it's characters is a workaholic. It seldom takes any time to stop for a breather or a decent introspective scene until the last ten minutes. It has so much energy that it makes two hours feel like 90 mins.The biggest problem however is Godzilla himself, he doesn't look so good. We see him first in a sort of 'yet to evolve' state after he crawls out of the sea and starts lumbering downs city streets. He looks like a prize at an akihabara arcade, with comically large parade float eyes. Before long however, he evolves into the form that we are all familiar with. How disappointing it is then that his CGI body is hardly anymore mobile or realistic than the body suits from sixty years ago. Sure he can let out a good roar, breath fire and shoot radiation lasers from his back, but he has neither majesty nor menace. So lifeless is this Godzilla that he barely has any notice to a bombardment of missiles on his head. You can't even make him angry because he has no attitude. These scenes are not particularly compelling, but there are a few nice shots in there, including your traditional long shot of bottle neck traffic from evacuating citizens With a little help from the international community, a plan to defeat Godzilla is devised. The climactic battle which hinges on this plot point is not only anticlimactic but it borders on cartoon. I won't spoil it, for fear that I will ruin a good laugh for you. In the end, Shin-Godzilla takes itself too seriously to notice its short comings. It feels like a thing of the past."
" worst Godlilla movie ever made
",-0.6249,-0.8157,2017-08-07 00:00:00,1,"I was really looking forwards to seeing this movie, being a Godzilla and monster film fan since childhood This piece of trash was the worst movie in the Godzilla genre, two hours of my life wasted on total garbage. the actors if you can call them that were completely incompetent and couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag, I've never heard the word sorry in any movie repeated so many times that it was sickening to hear it repeated constantly, the monster totally out of proportion and unbelievably cheap looking, give me the guy in the foam rubber suit anytime over this disproportionate lump of sewage, the tail being over 3 times the size of the creature. Don't waste your money or time, just total garbage. Others who said they enjoyed, must have been payed to say that."
" Godzilla returns to Japan more than a monster
",0.0,0.9857,2017-08-07 00:00:00,8,"I was wanting to see this movie in theaters; unfortunately, it never came to a theater that was all that close to me. I figured it would be on DVD in March, but it took all the way to August for the DVD release and now that I have finally watched it I have to say I enjoyed it; however, at the same time I have to wonder what all the fuss was about. I actually think the 2014 American Godzilla film was better than this one, once again I liked this one as the scenes with Godzilla are really cool and there are a lot of weird things going on as far as Big G in this film, but there is way too much bureaucratic stuff going on that makes what should be an exciting and even scary film at times a bit of a slow moving one. When I saw the trailers I noticed that there were lots of shots of meetings and stuff like that and that the shots of Godzilla had him barely moving at all and that is pretty much how the film plays out. In a strange way, the film is kind of like an American action film akin to the Hulk. You get three action scenes and a lot of filler in between. Makes the actions scenes seem cooler, but at times I was getting bored and hoping there would be some strange new revelation or there would be shaking indicating Godzilla had arrived or begun moving again.The movie starts out rather quickly as a boat is found without anyone on it and then steam begins to rise from the bay and an underwater tunnel springs a leak. Then we get meetings and such about the disaster and one person suggests that it may be a huge creature and he is scoffed at until the television reveals a giant tail. Soon this creature is making its way down the river and the public is told that it is believed the creature cannot make landfall due to its massive size right before it makes landfall. Then they keep hesitating attacking the behemoth though it looks very weak initially as it must crawl, then it stands erect and the skin seems to harden. It soon retreats to the ocean and comes back larger and more powerful than anyone could have imagined. A team working independently of the government forms a plan to stop the monster dubbed Godzilla as the military fails with its attacks. Can this group come up with a good plan before a nuclear missile is launched into the middle of Tokyo?This Godzilla was interesting and strange as I thought it would be knowing the director. That being said, while this Godzilla is rather tough, former Godzillas would make mincemeat of it. The one from Final Wars would have destroyed it fairly quickly. I see a lot of people debating this and some actually suggest this one would win because of its multiple ways to deploy its signature heat beam, but it is so slow! The Final Wars Godzilla would run circles around this one and its heat ray doesn't deplete it to the point of stopping for days! I did enjoy the 2014 movie more, but this is due to personal preference as I have always enjoyed Godzilla fighting another monster. Here he looks cool and there are some cool aspects to him, but I would rather of seen it go toe to toe with another monster.So, I liked this Godzilla film as there were some interesting things going on, but I really think 15 or 20 minutes of this thing could easily have been trimmed off. If you are going to have human scenes do something interesting like finding the strange link between the one missing scientist and Godzilla or something. I do believe a sequel to this could be made as there were some questions left unanswered and it would be interesting to see how it would play out and if another monster would be introduced or perhaps some sort new military weapon that is similar to something found in the Evangelion series. It would be interesting, thus the fact this movie was slow is because it was an introduction to a series that will get even more bizarre as it progresses. One can only hope as I would like to see the story continue."
" No escaping a god incarnate
",0.0258,0.9976,2017-08-04 00:00:00,8,"After waiting for a whole year, I finally got my hands on the award-winning Japanese film ""Shin Godzilla"", directed by Hideaki Anno (Evangelion) and Shinji Higuchi (live action Attack On Titan). With the praise this film got, did it live up to the hype for me? Yes and to an extent no.The film is a modern-day remake, showing how would the Japanese government (and to an extent other governments) react if Godzilla showed up for the first time today. This film is one of the more politically-charged entries in the franchise and is more of a thriller than a straight-up monster movie. There are lots of characters, a majority of which don't have much personality, but the main ones like protagonist Rando I found myself latching on to. Some the best scenes are when the characters stop acting like politicians and have casual and occasionally humorous dialogue. At least they took the whole situation very seriously with rarely an over-the-top moment much like the 2014 film, a breath of fresh air within the franchise. There's also this mystery element that plays a huge part in the story which I liked very much. Just as the 1954 film was a metaphor for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, this one reflects the Fukushima meltdown as well as the tsunami and earthquake Japan suffered a few years back (goes to show that Godzilla will always find a way to stay relevant).How does Big G himself hold up? Pretty good. His design is more-or-less an update of his original 1954 look, his skin looking like radiation scars. New to the series is that Godzilla EVOLVES throughout, starting out smaller and very odd-looking but growing larger, more powerful, and even smarter as the story progresses, making him unpredictable. I also enjoyed the exploration of his biology, that is how this creature could exist. My complaints fall under a few things, strictly on his main form: his arms are too small and he isn't very expressive, mostly just lumbering along in a straight line. When he does gets mad, however, that's when he really shines. The action scenes are entertaining enough and there's plenty of destruction featured with some surprising moments here and there. The special effects are largely CGI with elements of practical effects, both of which are good; Big G isn't a man in a suit this time (kinda disappointing) but rather motion capture, though there are a few well-done miniatures. Some sound effects are of the old era and the music is a mix of the original's by Akira Ifukube with some new ones by Shiro Sagisu, a lovely combo. There's even a track from Evangelion (Decisive Battle).My favorite scene: The first time Godzilla uses his atomic breath. Set at night with a mournful choir singing in the background (w/ English lyrics), the suspense that builds to the monster unleashing his power and rage upon the world was epic, chilling even, and has tremendous payoff. It's a truly apocalyptic image.There are a few issues to address. I admit the pacing isn't the best. The beginning particularly has some rapid editing and there are texts on the screen throughout (often naming a character and political position) that are quite distracting and take getting used to, though I suppose you're supposed to feel as rushed as these politicians. Also, there's a huge gap before the climax where there's no action going on that I honestly think the filmmakers should have cut down a little. I like the characters and what's happening to them, but I would have preferred for the film to cut to the chase a bit.Overall, this movie has its faults for sure, but I'm still glad I saw it. It was an interesting twist to my favorite fictional character. More films in both Japan and America are on the way and I can't wait. Long live the King of the Monsters!"

" Shin Godzilla Review - Warning Spoiler Alert!!
",-0.1984,-0.9677,2017-08-03 00:00:00,1,"I am huge fan of the Godzilla movies and giant robot/monster movies in general. Loved Kong Skull Island and probably my favorite is Pacific Rim!! It saddens me to say this.This has to be the ALL TIME WORST of all the Godzilla movies EVER MADE!!! ** SPOILER ALERTS ** The majority of the movie is set within various boardrooms and offices with government officials changing clothes on a regular basis and trying to make decisions on what to do with Godzilla. When I say boardrooms... you will be BORED to tears with this movie! Then you get various shots of what looks like a cheap dog toy with its eyelids ripped off coming ashore minus the squeaky squeaky! This of course mutates into what we know as Godzilla later in the movie. When he finally mutates into what is recognized as Godzilla it comes off like an Attack On Titan kind of vibe to him. However the proportions to his various body parts are so out of whack, they make him look more comical than menacing. He also lacked ANY emotion or charisma, it's like the lights were are on, but nobody was home. He simply looks dead and moves as if he was rear ended in a car accident. You got the occasional iconic Godzilla Roar and that was about it.The movie is so bad that Godzilla actually falls asleep in the middle of Tokyo at one point. It was apparently because he expended so much energy, but in reality it was probably because he was tired of waiting on the government officials to change clothes and room location.The only portion of this movie I enjoyed was the first 5 minutes when you see the bubbling ocean anticipating Godzilla coming up. Then its all down hill from there, right into the gutter..Don't even get me started on the horrible dialog! Over and Out!"
" Distasteful Nationalism at the Core but Still Good
",0.5927,0.8714,2017-08-03 00:00:00,8,"I am a a life-long Godzilla fanatic and I really enjoyed this reboot. In fact, it may very well be the greatest Godzilla movie of all-time. The movie focused mainly upon the Japanese response to the state of emergency caused by the arrival of the atomic waste-reptile-God upon the shores of their nation. This movie is a very human take on what would happen if such an event took place in reality. I lived in Japan for five years and I grew to love the land and its people. I greatly admire they're sense of teamwork to overcome adversity. On the other hand, the overwhelming nationalism of the race was off-putting at times and this movie is an example of Japan patting Japan upon its' back. There's also a very blatant anti-Americanism in the film that seemed a bit excessive to me. Damned if we do, damned if we don't step up to the plate to deal with a crisis. You can substitute Kim Jon for Godzilla for a clearer picture of the real message here."
" Better than the last...
",0.4404,0.9136,2017-07-15 00:00:00,7,"...US Godzilla movie. Reminiscent of some of the classics with some decent CGI added(on a budget).I always find it a bit difficult to judge acting while reading subtitles, but for the most part the cast seemed to give solid performances. If you are going into this expecting deep, moving character portrayals stop now, this ain't the movie you are looking for.CGI/Special effects were good considering the budget(pretty sure pre-evolution Gojira was supposed to look unfinished).Plot and story, though as expected for a remake, were done reasonably well. Political subplots, while a bit tired, were interesting.Ultimately, while not destined to be a classic, this is a solid entry into the genre.Grab some popcorn, this is a good way to spend a couple free hours on a rainy Saturday afternoon."

" 16,000 rounds of machine gun fire. Not even a scratch...
",-0.5859,0.995,2017-06-15 00:00:00,7,"I must admit that I was somewhat thrilled to get the chance to sit down and watch ""Shin Gojira"" (aka ""Godzilla Resurgence""), although it was about a year after it was initially released. I have always liked the Godzilla movies, and it has always been interesting to see the evolution of Godzilla over the years.So it was especially nice to have a story that deals with the origin and first evolution of Godzilla for a change.The effects in this 2016 rendering of ""Godzilla"" was actually quite good. It was especially refreshing and great to see that they's didn't opt for the CGI look that the American versions of ""Godzilla"" introduced to the world. There is just something far more familiar and reassuring about the old style design that they went for in ""Shin Gojira"". This style might not suit just everyone, especially if you are a fan of the American versions and not the Japanese versions. But if you are a long-time fan, then this will definitely be pleasing to the eyes.The special effects department really made an amazing job at bringing realism to ""Shin Gojira"". And it was such a visual treat to witness the effects brought to life on the screen.Godzilla is looking very interesting, in both his larval stage, but definitely also in his evolved state. And the way he is designed in ""Shin Gojira"" is definitely very much in tune with the numerous older Japanese movies, but still with a distinct difference and upgrade. And it is so satisfying the first time you hear Godzilla's iconic scream.""Shin Gojira"" starts out at a high pace and puts the audience into the action almost right away. That was a great way to start off the movie, and the movie didn't really lose momentum throughout the course of running. So the pacing was good and fast, proving quite entertaining.The characters in the movie were plentiful, which lead to most of them not really having any chance to shine on the screen. Most of the characters were shallow and superficial, providing no real depth to their characters as they had no chance to do so.I was wondering why they had one of the actresses speak some of her dialogue in English, because it was sounding so strange, as her pronunciations was way off. If she was supposed to be an American emissary, it was a really lousy choice of linguistic skill for the task. She should just stick to Japanese and not switch between English and Japanese. And if they really need someone to speak English, at least get someone properly up to the task.It should be said that the cast ensemble was quite good, and they had some very talented actors and actresses to perform the various roles and characters throughout the movie. If you are familiar with Japanese cinema, then you will recognize a familiar face here and there.Personally, I like the chaos that is present in the ""Godzilla"" movies, with the panicking and fleeing people, and the destruction following in the wake of the mighty Godzilla. And trust me, there is an abundance of destruction to be witnessed throughout the course of ""Shin Gojira"".The music score in ""Shin Gojira"" was also quite good, especially because they use the classic ""Godzilla"" theme, so there is some familiarity with the music that accompanies the visuals on the screen.The drawback of the movie is that there is way too many scenes with long dialogue between military personnel and state officials, and that meant less screen time for Godzilla. Which is a shame, because it is essentially the mighty Godzilla that the audience wants to watch.With ""Shin Gojira"", directors Hideaki Anno, Shinji Higuchi and Cris George reclaim the kaijū (怪獣) and put Godzilla back in the hands of Japan, where he rightfully belong. And no amount of Hollywood dollars can change that fact; Godzilla is and will always be Japanese."
" People are NUTS, this movie is horrifically over rated
",-0.7865,-0.8403,2017-06-14 00:00:00,1,"90 percent of this film is watching a bunch of Japanese in a single room discuss the bureaucracy and politics of a Godzilla attack. No, I'm being serious....I don't see how any one could truly enjoy that. It's very boring, and tedious. There is literally all together about 2-3 minutes of action in this movie, the rest is big long political conversations about how they should and shouldn't react to Godzilla destroying the city. No, I am being serious, again...Horrid film experience, I don't recommend at all."
" Incredible HIGH PRODUCTION value and NO cgi, leads to a fantastic, vintage spectacular movie
",0.4708,-0.6843,2017-06-02 00:00:00,8,"Okay, so the thing that makes this movie stand out among all the CGI crap out there, is that they do NOT use CGI as much, or, at all. The first monster, except the eyes, sure, is actually incredibly realistic. As I understood it, it's an homage to the first actors who played these man-in-monster-suit roles for Gojira. But since this is NOT CGI, it looks incredibly realistic, much more than it would have with CGI. Remember how the first Star Wars looks more realistic than the cartoonish Phantom Menace? It's like that.As for the script of the movie, it's fairly amazing that a Japanese prime minister would be this incompetent: He doesn't wanna make any decision, they never prepare for all eventualities, or say they will, no they wanna wait for more TESTING. The movie is an outcry against slow bureaucracy during a crisis. Which is odd for a country that experiences so much earthquakes. As a European, I think it's unrealistic that a Japanese PM or government would be thís incompetent or indecisive.What is really huge about this movie is the production value. I don't know how they did it, but all the mass public scenes outdoor had hundreds or thousands of people and cars etc. in it. This was really great. Also the indoor scenes were sometimes massive with hundreds of people. That must have cost a lot! This is the other way this movie is an homage to old style films-spectacular, like Spartacus, Ben Hur etc.I get the whole non-aggression thing about their army, but I found this a little suspend believe. Would they really be this slow and bureaucratic? It's possible, I'm not Japanese.What was annoying were all the notes of places and characters. It's was mostly annoying in the subtitles. Overall good movie, but I subtracted points for above reasons.The Melancholic Alcoholic. 8/10"

Err, not really.The 'monster' first time we see it, is horrific. And I don't mean that in a scary way. It's just plain embarrassing how bad it looks.It actually resembles a string puppet, with wide eyes that don't move. I mean the eyeballs nor lids don't move. And rest of the monster has an unrealistic texture to it. I'm told this was the monster in its 'baby' form, and later it changes into something more animated...Anyway, the 'baby' comes out of the sea and just trashes buildings, cars and people, with no emotion. Or purpose. This I found very disappointing.And then coupled with this, there are endless government and army meetings. One after the other. It all becomes a joke that isn't funny. There is endless talking that makes the viewer want to switch off the subtitles.And just when you thought the last meeting had come and gone, another one started and it's at that point I gave up on this movie. It had 40 minutes of my time and let me down badly.The rest of the movie might be great. Who knows. But judging on the parts I saw it didn't look good. And quite frankly I couldn't be bothered to stick with it.Just 3/10."

Godzilla is a horrible CGI creature (the eyes, the eyes!; those hands that never move or twitch; don't start with the movement that makes it seem as if it's going on rails) but it is threatening enough, especially with people not knowing what to do with it, everyone just running around as a chicken without head. Its powers are never clearly explained, but again, this is not as important as the impact they have."

I saw it in a German cinema and was blown away! I saw the US-movie Godzilla (2014) before and I liked that movie very much too, but I love this Japanese version even more. They are different movies, very different stories and a very different Godzilla. However, in this Japanese movie I found Godzilla even more threatening and dangerous, also I love the unique filmmaking style (retro and modern at the same time). I encourage everyone who liked the US-Godzilla movie or just likes great movies in general to watch this one. This movie is also a perfect example that you don't need a huge budget to make an awesome movie. The budget was far smaller than for the US version (I couldn't believe!), but you wouldn't guess that, because Godzilla's devastation is epic, the actors are great, the direction is fantastic, etc. This movie was made by people who love Godzilla and understand what makes a great movie and it shows.

",0.0,-0.3043,2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,"Without spoiling anything, this is the kind of experience I've been starved for in kaiju films. Not just awe-inspiring, but terrifying. Realistically, kaiju would be terrifying for those in their path, and not just for their literal scale but the scale of their destructive power. Something common in monster movies is to focus on the action, but not as much on their impact, or the character-building (the monster's included), or the world-building. Kaneko Shusuke's Gamera trilogy and Gareth Edwards' Godzilla got that awe and world-building, but this is the first kaiju film I've seen that is truly horrifying. Anno Hideaki and Higuchi Shinji did not hold back, they definitely worked hard on this one and really put in a lot of thought. Speaking of Anno, you can definitely catch the Evangelion vibes (and references) in this one; it certainly does feel like the end of days. But, and I can't appreciate this enough, we don't just jump into the horror. It's a slow, suspenseful, plot-building reveal. A lot of films these days could benefit from writing in more patience to give those climaxes the wham they deserve.This Godzilla design is not ""attractive"" like the 1990's designs, but I like it a lot because I think it really reflects its backstory. Its genetic blueprint is haphazard but ridiculously potent, its evolution is a rush job, to say its mutations are unnatural is an understatement, and its everything just looks wrong. But that's the whole point. (Yes, genetically, it has been rigged for overwhelming success, but in nature that is a recipe for disaster. Overly successful species with no competition, prolific species especially, are the ones most likely to run whole ecosystems to the ground, and that's exactly the path Godzilla has been set on as an animal.) If you are familiar with Takahashi Rumiko's manga the Mermaid Saga, Godzilla's earlier scenes reminded me of the Lost Souls, and I think that's appropriate. This Godzilla is supposed to be as ugly and warped and downright scary as the forces responsible for its conception. And last, I love the volcanic look they went with for this Godzilla. It vaguely reminds me of the ""meltdown Godzillas,"" but it's definitely a new look altogether while bringing back motifs from the original in 1954.Shin Godzilla did a lot to return to its roots, especially in the audio, and yet put forth something entirely new. So finally, let's be clear here. This is not the Godzilla we know and love. This is a Godzilla we've never known before, and should be afraid of. 10/10, I was shook."

Who knows?) looked like it came from a Chinese dragon dance. The face was expressionless, it didn't make a sound until an hour in, it sat in stupefied silence as a horde of helicopters descended on it, it destroyed almost everything in Tokyo (inexplicably... no reason whatsoever given as to why it is attacking Tokyo)... everything except the government building housing every bad actor in Japan... I could go on, but what's the point? The director spent his time thinking of clever angles to shoot from, i.e. When someone finishes talking on the phone and hangs up, we see the phone coming towards us so that it hangs up on OUR face. Wow... that was some real great filmmaking there!This was a big, bad, stupid joke. A yawnfest. There was SOOOO much talking that all I could do was stare at it in amazement. If the Japanese take this long to make a decision when a giant beast is destroying their beloved capital, how the hell are they going to survive when NK lobs nukes at them? Probably not as long as this absolutely god-awful hideous POS... I can't even think of what else to call it. Oh, I LOVED the scenes when they purposely cut out a foreigner's face, but had them speak English to give the film an ""international presence."" Give me a break.

" Godzilla? Bureaucracy Boardroom Meeting Politics: The Movie. Fukushima Reactor
",0.0,-0.9844,2017-04-26 00:00:00,4,"First of all, I'm Japanese/American. People need this warning: Sorry, but this film is actually really stressing and annoying to watch. When you first watch it, you REALLY need to prepare yourself to get into this... it's not a feel-good film.There's just lots and lots of ramblings and soo much political talking jargon, most regular viewers would just get so stressed out watching it; not to mention the annoying fast cuts/just going through different departments of everyone arguing and making dumb decisions. It's almost as if Aaron Sorkin (the guy who wrote 'Social Network' and 'Steve Jobs') was the screenwriter, with the style of having so much ramblings that go on and on forever... I get it that it's chaotic, and Japanese people are so adamant about routine protocols, trying to always go by the blueprint/follow all regulations, that it actually ends up backfiring and wasting time rambling on and on going over the codes, getting permissions from every damn department, instead of getting to the real issue swiftly and acting more rationally on a case-by-case basis; like ants marching in precision, but when they lose the scent of their path, they scatter and go all over the place erratically and not know what to do.Clearly, the film is more of a satire/making fun of the Japanese government of how they handled things during the 2011 earthquake/tsunami Fukushima reactor radiation disaster. The resemblance is obvious. If America were to make a ""Godzilla"" film, or as an American viewer, we would usually expect a movie something like ""Armageddon"" (just blow things up, one-man hero... yee-haw!)This ""Shin Godzilla"" film reminds me of more like ""Deep Impact"" (if you've never seen that disaster film, which came out around the same time as Armageddon (1998), it focused more on the news media/government handling than the disaster itself. Well, don't get me wrong... I enjoyed watching Deep Impact more than this film)Personally, I'd like to see a Godzilla film where they show how different lives of people are impacted by it; that's actually what I was expecting or hoping to watch, but there really was none of that. It's just all bureaucratic people. Zero romance. No touching scenes (pun intended.. I mean I didn't cry at all, and I cry pretty easily watching movies). You don't see how the regular citizens are feeling about the whole thing at all. I mean, I also don't want to see just an action film of Godzilla being shot at for 2 hours either; that would be just as boring. At the same time, hours of boardroom meetings and just yelling and arguing is absolutely tortuous to watch (people actually enjoy watching this part?); maybe that was the point to show how ridiculous and annoying the system is, but it also just doesn't make it a good movie experience. I also don't care for the cliché one-brilliant-scientist who figures out the ""secret code"" to defeat the monster. The computer graphics are so-so. I guess in a way, it is interesting to see the contrast where if it were America, they would react by just immediately going ""Blow that ****'ing monster up!"" regardless of collateral damage. In this film/Japan, they would be wasting time going over regulation codes and abort just firing bullets at Godzilla simply because they spotted one single old man and child crossing the street. (Apparently, they didn't care about Godzilla knocking over buildings and killing people still inside... can't risk that old man and child!)I get it that the film is more about ""evolving"", being united, teamwork, and showing resilience. There seems to be a little surprise twist at the end that seems to be a setup for a sequel, but most people will definitely go ""Huh? What was that?""I did like the homage to the original Godzilla theme song. I think the concept idea is interesting, but the film itself is just more of a stressful experience (I guess the same way Japan feels about the way they handled the tsunami Fukushima disaster) than an enjoyable one."

The only monster action in the first act is seen from short Youtube clips shot in hand-held (Cloverfield style). By Japanese Godzilla standards, this made for a very realistic feel. When it is established that everything is caused by a giant monster we finally get a good look at the creature and a few great but short doses of monster action.Emphasis on the word ""short"". Sadly, I have to say that this is much more of a political satire than it is a monster movie. I did enjoy the satire aspect for a while, but after the first hour it just got too much. I get the inefficient bureaucracy of Japan; I get the too many departments and none knowing who is responsible to deal with an unexpected situation; the allegory for the 2011 tsunami and the Fukushima incident; and how foreign interference affects decision making in Japan... I GET IT. But what I signed up for was a Godzilla movie – not Dr. Strangelove.Now we all complained that the 2014 US Godzilla gave us only 8 minutes of Godzilla action (in 10 second bursts) spread out over the second half of the movie. In Shin Godzilla, the monster has about the same amount of screen time, but is shown in awesome 3 minute bursts. Unfortunately, between one bombastic Godzilla scene and the next there are 40 minutes of political satire. As the movie progresses the endless political dialogue starts to drag on and on. When the climax comes along, after such a hideously long wait, it inevitably feels weak. If they were to cut 20 minutes of dialogue out of the last hour, then the climax would be a better fit.I'll give it a 6/10 because the second half is too weak."
" A different take on real matters

Godzilla is just an excuse to show problems most of the countries are facing today: excessive bureaucracy, the nuclear threat forced upon us by a few powerful countries, staggering economy, refugees and, most of all, how to deal with a new, unknown powerful and constantly evolving enemy (terrorism) without breaking laws and hurting your own people.""Shin Godzilla"" has all of the above, and we get that in the very first minutes of the movie, and although it is a long movie, it is always surprising us, viewers, with unexpected problems and situations. If you're going to watch this movie for FX or CGI, forget about it. This is not what this movie is about. Like I wrote, the monster itself is just a ""background drop"" for showing other real life problems not only Japan, but the entire world is suffering."

" Godzilla Resurgence (2016)
",0.0,0.9835,2017-03-31 00:00:00,7,"I don't always check out the Japanese Godzilla films but I do love monster films and did think the trailer for this new re-imagining looked exciting. I know the Monster Universe in Hollywood is just taking off with a planned crossover between King Kong and Godzilla, so it was worth checking out what Japan was doing with Godzilla in the meantime. Overall, the film makes for an entertaining time. If you love Godzilla and are a die hard fan you will love this latest installment. There's enough in it to please the more casual fans.The film is basically rebooting Godzilla's origins with its first attack on Japan. A mysterious gigantic sea creature emerges and starts wrecking havoc on the city. They soon realize that this creature morphs and evolves when it comes onto land and changes into different forms. The country tries to brace for disaster while trying to figure out ways to take out Godzilla. The new model for Godzilla looks really cool. He looks ridiculous at first, almost cartoony, when he first comes out of the water. We get more of Godzilla in this than say the 2014 film and get to see much more of what he's capable of.The real negative of the film is the various lengthy human characters and their winding plots. There are too many generals and officials discussing what to do and it can't really avoid being tedious. Its expected, monster movies can't go all out with the majority of the screen time dedicated to big monster action but this film spends a lot of time on the human element. While the film doesn't shy away from showing Godzilla in action, its hampered by a lot of what's going on everywhere else as well.The CG at times does not look that great, especially with Godzilla at first coming out of the water and some of the damage done to the city. It makes sense since the budget for this film wasn't too high (at least not by Hollywood standard). Its not always bad as some of the scenes with Godzilla destroying Japan are done really well. Overall, the film is far from perfect butt definitely will please the fans who came in knowing exactly what they are looking for. The ending and final battle is also interesting and I've got to say my interest is piqued for a sequel.7/10"
" A Onetime Watchable Movie!!!
",0.0,-0.6815,2017-03-30 00:00:00,6,"A normal day in Japan turns into a disaster one when a Godzilla arrives on the shore. Within no time Godzilla starts to tear up the city. The Japanese Politicians has to act quickly in order to stop it from tearing the whole country. Shin Godzilla is the 29th Godzilla film produced by Japan's Toho Studios and the 32nd worldwide. The film mainly concentrates on strategies of politicians to solve the situation. Director's Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi makes the movie more political than an apocalyptic event. Anno's screenplay also shows the loopholes of the Japanese government to follow protocol even when an unimaginable event has occurred. The film's score by Shiro Sagisu was very impressive. Overall, it's a watchable monster movie and enjoyable if you are not expecting much from it."
" Tohopeless.
",0.0,0.918,2017-03-19 00:00:00,3,"A strange-looking, oversized lizard creature (with googly eyes) emerges from the sea and lumbers into Tokyo, slowly evolving into the scaly titan we know as Godzilla. Meanwhile, the authorities try to figure out a way to stop the monster in its (extremely slow) tracks before there is nothing left of the city.Here it is proof that it's not just the Americans who can screw up a Godzilla movie. While the special effects are pretty good, and Godzilla himself looks cool (once he has evolved), this latest home-grown adventure for the giant lizard is just as dull and talkative as Gareth Edward's 2014 snooze-fest, with important meetings for the military top-brass and politicians taking up way more screen-time than Godzilla trashing Tokyo.Oh well, at least the majority of this one doesn't take place in the dark, which means that, when it happens, we can actually see Godzilla doing his thing, even if the action is executed in such a detached, soulless manner as to be completely devoid of excitement."
" Go Go Godzilla
",0.0,0.3672,2017-03-07 00:00:00,10,Now this is more like it. All we needed to make it perfect was The Blue Oyster Cult.Starting with a sea anomaly and a leaky tunnel Tokyo authorities gather to discuss the problem moving from room to room and committee to committee. One of them mentions the internet is claiming the problem is caused by a large sea creature. He is dismissed by his colleagues as an idiot. Then the idiot is proved correct when a really silly looking creature starts working its way up a river causing a lot of damage.The Japanese PM announces that there is no danger of it coming ashore as it would collapse under its own weight. Only to be told it has come ashoreYou wonder what the hell this thing is as it looks more like a homeless snail than an icon as it slithers its way though town demolishing buildings as it goes.. Then it seems to collapse under its own weight. Just as the PM had predicted.But before anyone can figure out what's going on something amazing happens it seems to grow and is able to stand up and walk before disappearing into the waters of Tokyo Bay. It's evolving someone whispers.Is the crisis over. Of Course not.More committees and more rooms later they are still no wiser when we hear that the creature is back. Only it is no longer a silly looking sea snail crawling on its belly or even the equally silly looking creature that fell back into the bay.It's evolved again into the awesome Godzilla.Unlike the American garbage Godzilla movies this is Godzilla in all his glory.Finally the Japanese Defence force is unleashed on its arce and then the Yanks stick their noses in. But does Godzilla care? Not one bit.Yes there may be satire at Japanese society and America and lots of other 'clever' things contained in the movie. But all we care about is Godzilla is portrayed not as some egg laying iguana or American puppet come to destroy it's enemies. But as Godzilla.And just like the song 'oh no there goes Tokyo go go Godzilla!' Godzilla does not mess around.The Japanese make some amazing cinema. Add this to the list.
" I wasn't Ga-Ga-Godzilla over it.
",0.0,0.9537,2017-02-26 00:00:00,6,"I really wanted to love this, after all I've been a Godzilla fan since I was watching the Raymond Burr version every Thanksgiving while growing up. (Note: the version without Raymond is FAR Superior), but I ended up only liking it. Part of the problem is that like the recent US version (which I also wanted to love but only liked) was that it was too talky. When I see a Godzilla movie, I want more Godzilla (and whoever he's fighting) and less exposition. The acting was superb, but I really had a problem with this Godzilla design. It's initial showing was just too cartoony and his later adult version, while I didn't mind him being ugly (and his nuclear power was freaking awesome) were those tiny arms. What the hell is G going to do with those tiny things? So overall, while I found it entertaining, it won't ever find it's place among the great Godzilla movies like Gojira and Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla. Worth seeing but I wasn't Ga-Ga Godzilla over it."
" 2014 was better than this Pile of Shite
",0.4404,0.3772,2017-02-20 00:00:00,3,"OK, I just want to say that this movie was not put well together. the scenes were all over the place, it was rushed, the characters were forgettable, it was TOO political(Came out at the worst time), and the ending was Stupid. it was so stupid, you might as well drop a nuke on japan. the only great thing about it was the tribute to old Godzilla movies and Godzilla himself. People Say Revenge was the worst. But Shin Godzilla takes that place now. I love Godzilla and I own 28 of the Toho films and this Godzilla will not see my collection. It was not a well put together film. I thought Gareth Edwards Godzilla was put together real well and I like the story, pacing, and the acting. Gareth Edward Godzilla was better than Shin Godzilla."
" Awesome, quirky political thriller
",0.6705,0.9335,2017-02-06 00:00:00,10,"DO NOT watch this movie expecting an action movie.Instead, this is an expertly crafted political satire poking fun at the domestic Japanese political machine. Godzilla only appears in less than 30 minutes of the film.It also is a powerful critique of the weakened state of Japan's military capabilities. The government is completely at the mercy of the UN and the US when deciding it's own fate.Godzilla makes a couple of fun appearances, and he is definitely the most bad ass Godzilla yet, but this movie will resonate much better with lovers of The Big Short or Woody Allan's films than action buffs."
" Review - Godzilla Resurgence (Shin Godzilla)
",0.0,-0.9747,2017-01-28 00:00:00,3,"Just finished watching the movie. Godzilla, the monster, emerges in Tokyo (Japan) again. The start of the movie with mysterious activity on the bay was good. I, myself was enthused and eagerly waited for the giant to surface. But......and I mean but, when it surfaced, it was like a clone baby of Godzilla, bleeding from neck, unable to stand, destroying the city. It was cartoonish and put me off.On the other side, government was desperately trying to find ways to stop the beast. And the help finally came through the notes of a professor exiled from Japan. Of course, the professor was nowhere to be found and the notes were encrypted in origami. what the hell man.OK, I must tell you that the freakish clone baby then disappears in water and comes back all grown up to kick ass. Fire breath, laser from mouth, dorsal fins, tale and a** were included in Godzilla's fire power. The monster destroyed everything in its path including army and Japanese politics. Finally he was drugged and frozen to be used again. Lolz.Forgot the best part, he was suffering from Narcolepsy and took day time naps here and there.But you must watch the movie, if you need a laugh."
" A more contemporary, mature and realistic interpretation of the greatest monster franchise in the history of cinema
",0.8062,0.9882,2017-01-21 00:00:00,8,"''Shin Gojira'' marks a triumphant comeback for the most famous monster in the history of cinema. This Toho reboot is the first movie in the Japanese franchise since ''Godzilla: Final Wars'' twelve years earlier. Just like the American reboot which was simply entitled ''Godzilla'', the new Japanese film also manages to fit the legendary monster in a contemporary setting. While the American movie focused on the consequences of a nuclear catastrophe in the key of Fukushima, the Japanese film imagines what would happen if Godzilla attacked Japan today. ''Shin Godzilla'' is a mixture of science-fiction action entertainment and political drama study.That's why most parts of the movie can be seen as surprisingly realistic. The film follows Japan's Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary and how he and his fellow politicians deal with the unexpected attack of a resilient monstrosity. Heated discussions about the origins of the monster, an appropriate way to deal with media and public and the question whether to accept to attack the monster with a nuclear bomb or to speculate on a risky alternative strategy are the main topics in this film. Despite a big cast, some actresses and actors manage to stand out and carry this movie. Hasegawa Hiroki convinces as brave, diplomatic and smart lead actor. Ishihara Satomi has an interesting role as Special Envoy for the President of the United States and portrays an ambitious, extroverted and glamorous young woman who adds some spice to a cast that mostly centers around more conservative male characters. The roles of two different prime ministers are portrayed interestingly as well. The first one seems shocked by the events but determined to control and defeat Godzilla. The second one feels disenchanted and powerless and since his leadership is lacking, a team of young politicians and scientists try everything they can to find a strategy to defeat what seems to be an unbeatable monster.The movie convinces with this more contemporary, mature and realistic touch showing us the social, scientific and political impacts of Godzilla's unexpected arrival. On the other side, the monster itself is also quite intriguing because it's constantly mutating and changing its appearance and capacities. This makes Godzilla unpredictable and scarier than ever before. Godzilla is far away from being a pitiable or even sympathetic protagonist but a brutal and pitiless antagonist. The monster is taller and stronger than ever, its eyes look evil and its large mouth with its sharp teeth looks like an entrance into hell. The special effects in the movie are efficient and never look too unrealistic which adds a lot to the depressing atmosphere and dramatic vibe of the movie leading to a spectacular showdown. These great executions make the viewers forget that the outcome of the story is actually quite predictable right from the start and that the plot is a little bit too pathetic and patriotic at times.One point people might argue about is that Godzilla doesn't have as much screening time as in many movies from the past. It's not as blatant as in the last American movie where Godzilla would only appear in the second half of the film but it's true that slightly below two thirds of the movie focus indeed on the political drama study while slightly above one third offers science-fiction action entertainment. On the other side, this was already the case in the very first Godzilla movie which is without a doubt the best in franchise history and what worked well back then also works out in the present. The action sequences might be shorter but have a powerful effect while the characters and the story have enough depth to carry the film and make the viewers care about it. One should also note that this is the first Japanese Godzilla movie since the first one that only features Godzilla and no other monsters.In the end, ''Shin Godzilla'' isn't an excellent but still a very good Japanese comeback of the world's greatest monster in the history of cinema. I would put this movie in the bottom of my top ten list of the greatest Godzilla movies which is a quite good result considering I'm a fan since my early childhood and that there are thirty-two Godzilla movies so far. Those who are looking for a more realistic, mature and contemporary interpretation of the famous franchise will like this movie and hope for a potential sequel in the near future."
" Godzilla has never looked scarier
",0.0,0.9924,2017-01-14 00:00:00,6,"Godzilla looked different in this film, and I like the new look they went with. It was different. Toho scaled back on the campy stuff and made a more realistic and serious film in the series again. I think that some of the best Godzilla films are the more serious ones, but it felt that this one could have needed some more fun sometimes. It was a little standard with the characters and situations with the military felt a bit repetitive.I expected more from it, but I got the usual traditional stuff that I am used to at this point. It was handled well and it was all right. I am curious on how they are gonna continue in the future, because as a re-introduction it was good enough.The best things about it were the effects and the cinematography. There are a lot of great shots of the city and Godzilla. I like the new light beam power Godzilla had and the scenes at night looked nice with the lights. I don't think Godzilla has ever looked scarier. It was nice hearing the original music again, but they should have done a new rendition on it. Because the music sounded very classic and the film felt very modern. It took me out of it a bit."
" What Is This? A Joke?
",0.3736,-0.8412,2017-01-12 00:00:00,2,"This was the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. THAT was Godzilla? When he first comes on screen, you think WTF? Godzilla is clearly two men in a monster suit. I thought it was a joke at first. His face has no expression; his eyes are frozen, never to move, like a child's teddy bear, and in side shots, you can almost see one man using levers to manipulate the head while the other flips the gigantic tail around.Another thing. By 2016, we have telescopes that can see a piece of tinfoil on the moon, yet we can't tell what's stirring up the waters in Tokyo Bay? Something so massively huge?You know what this Godzilla looked like? It looked like those dragons the Chinese drag out every year to parade around the boisterous streets in Chinatowns everywhere during Chinese New Year. The only thing missing were the sounds of thin cymbals and cheerleaders twirling their batons around the giant beast. What a joke. I couldn't look at the whole thing; life is way too precious to spend time watching travesties like this."
" The First Time I've been disappointed by a Toho Godzilla movie!!
",-0.5696,0.9936,2017-01-11 00:00:00,6,"I am a die-hard Godzilla fan, I have been watching all of his original movies from Toho many times (well except Godzilla's Revenge) and I have always had a good time watching my favourite dinosaur (not lizard) cause chaos. I am not really a fan of the American reboots but the 2014 film was decent at best, far better than the atrocious 1998 reboot.When Toho announced another Godzilla movie, I was hyped just like anyone else, I wanted this new Godzilla to be the start of a new series (which it may be, who knows) that I could enjoy. To say that I have mixed feelings would be an understatement. Firstly I can appreciate the nods to the original films, if you grew up with the Showa series as I did, you will instantly recognise the sound effects which I loved.Secondly I can understand that they wanted to make a serious Godzilla movie much like the 1954 original as well as the 1984/2000 reboots.However none of this can improve a horrible design of Godzilla, I really don't like this new look, horrible twiggy arms, tiny eyes, super long tail and worst of all, absolutely no expression. It feels like your looking at a huge statue who (slowly) walks by and barely does anything. The only decent part was his atomic breath which looked awesome and some destruction scenes, but the rest, not so much.Apart from the iconic monster's look, this film just contains too much political satire, too many meetings and not much else. Again I can understand a different approach, but when I go to watch a Godzilla movie I want to entertained not bored out of my wits. Much has been said of the three forms in the movie so I won't elaborate on that, but lets just say the CGI is average at best. I am very disappointed Toho didn't go with practical effects (suitmation) but again we can't have everything.If your a major Godzilla fan, chances are you've already seen this, but for those who haven't, it's definitely worth watching, just don't expect anything special. I never thought I would say this, but I actually prefer the 2014 Godzilla movie over this and coming from a die-hard Toho Godzilla fan, it's the first time ever an American reboot was superior."
