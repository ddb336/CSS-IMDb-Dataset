" Too slow in the middle
",0.0,0.9562,2021-04-05 00:00:00,7,An okay coming of age movie with some good moments but a pretty long slower moment in the middle. Interesting characters and a good performance as usual by Woody Harrelson. I wish he was more present in the movie.
" High School Sucks
",-0.3612,0.7269,2021-04-02 00:00:00,7,"Accurate depiction of how weird and awkward high school can really be. When her best friend of forever starts to date her jocky brother, Hailee Steinfeld starts a drastic search for herself."
" Hmmm how is this good
",0.5228,-0.9287,2021-03-29 00:00:00,2,It's ridiculous from the reviews i thought it would a good one but no I'm dissatisfied it was terrible nonsense.
" Nah...
",0.0,0.886,2021-03-21 00:00:00,4,"Your classic cringe movie. Far from real life and what love is about. I wish movies had some respect for human behaviour - anyway, an easy watch if you ignore all that."
" More than a simple high school comedy
",0.3612,0.9559,2021-03-16 00:00:00,10,"There's something about this film I adore. It barely has a plot, but it kept me interested throughout the entire movie. And I think that mainly comes down to how well done its characters are. Hailee Steinfeld is nothing short of amazing, and her simple conversation with her brother (played by Blake Jenner) towards the end is somehow the film's highlight. To say it's a comedy is a bit much, but it does have a lot of funny lines, most delivered by Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson) or Erwin Kim (Hayden Szeto). This is almost my favorite movie, and though it's certainly not going to appeal to everyone, I can't recommend this simple movie enough."
" I didn't stop laughing
",-0.1877,0.978,2021-03-09 00:00:00,9,"This movie is something else, excellent and perfect performance of Hailee Steinfeld that prove that she is a great actress, the plot is so funny and so a teenagers life with problems of socialization and that live in the shadow of their big brother or sister, this movie was great and I recommended at all, it is funny and so interesting and I simply can tell you that you need to see it."
" I wish people realise THAT EASY in real life too.
",0.7456,0.1836,2021-02-28 00:00:00,5,"AHHH!! takes time to build itself but disappoints in the end. I was quite excited to watch this one due to rave reviews, sadly found it boring.YA, 17 is an age of hormonal see-saw but Nadine feels likes way too much immature and toxic. And the climax is as unrealistic as it can get."
" Nothing remarkable about it
",-0.4449,-0.8225,2021-01-31 00:00:00,6,"It cracked me up a few times and I enjoyed the first 20 minutes or so, but the film gets progressively worse meaning - clichéd, predictable and boring. Even the jokes get worse. The dialogue is not enough to elevate it more than the average coming of age film and I had to force myself to watch the last 20 minutes."
" Nice seeing a female lead
",0.4215,0.8402,2021-01-25 00:00:00,7,Was a lot better than I expected it to be . It's nice seeing a female protagonist and seeing a film with a strong look on the life as a teenager
" Surprisingly impressive.
",0.6705,0.9935,2021-01-22 00:00:00,9,"I loved the chemistry between the main actors and actresses. They took deep into the characters that makes me easily relate to the circumstances in the movie. Idk why I wrote it so long lol but I have a lot to say.Teens of all age might experience the situation of awkwardness in the party, loneliness during luncheon time, feeling so damn lost and self-abased in some ways, or even hated ourselves from the bottom of our hearts, not to mention expecting others to like us. Somebody's attentiveness is luxurious to us.
And sure I did.
Like Nadine hate what she saw, how she's acting, the way she sounds when she's like floating outside of her body and looking down on herself. The inferiority swallows us, swallows rest of a bit confidence and dignity till we build up a tough wall against others.
Up to someday, there is a one who genuinely cherish you, love you and find out your special. Then the sincerity finally let down our guard so that we can finally get our reliefs.
It's not telling us do not break the hearts of those who's totally snowflakes, easily to get hurt and over sensitive. Instead, we should have greater empathy with others, because everyone has story.One of the impressive scene that Nadine's moms said: Here's what I do when I'm feeling down. I get very quiet and very still. And I said to myself "" Everyone in the world is as miserable and empty as I am."" ""They're just better at pretending."" I just deem it really helpful to me though.Although the most touching scene is the hugging scene Nadine and her brother did, I still especially loved the swimming pool scene in Erwin's house. They are sooo good together and Haley looks insanely pretty in that scene.
It's about growing, understanding, and empathizing. Highly recommended. Btw I need an Erwin in my life."

" Good coming of age film
",0.4404,0.8954,2020-12-22 00:00:00,10,"Beats lady bird. This film has more substance. And takes deep into the character. I would call Nadine behaviour mental illness. We are all dealing with stuff going.Mental illness would be a darker, sad movie. Etc. She is just over acting. Finding herself, she's dramatic sure. But we all have a story.I don't analyze this film at all. I only simply watch it and enjoy it. The actress in this film very talented. First saw her in true grit."
" Far too many similarities with the atrocious 13 Reasons Why
",0.0,0.5106,2020-11-30 00:00:00,5,"Other than a fun Woody Harrelson performance, The Edge Of Seventeen does nothing to elevate itself above the hoards of tedious teen coming-of-age movies largely due to the incredible off-putting and narcissistic main character."
" Perfect loner movie
",0.34,0.2732,2020-11-30 00:00:00,10,Very relatable film that shows the ups and downs for anyone that feels alone. Full humour and emotion.
" Better than most movies of the genre
",0.4404,0.9298,2020-11-29 00:00:00,8,"The main character, Nadine, is actually slightly annoying for the better part of the movie. A bit of drama queen, everything is always about her. Even when there was some tragic stuff in her past, it doesn't warrant such behavior.She has a few wakeup calls in the end, and that's the whole point of coming-of-age movies I guess. Growing as a personShe's witty throughout though, very well written dialogue. Having insights that seem a bit too clever and mature for most 17-year olds. (I believe she was 19 or 20 in this role, typical for Hollywood)Scenes with Woody Harrelson (her teacher) are hilarious, anything that guy says here is just gold. I actually re-watched the teacher-student scenes couple of times, they are hilarious.I liked this more than Mean Girls, or Perks of Being a Wallflower. Better than most coming-of-age movies. Seen quite few of them"
" It's a good movie
",0.4404,0.9866,2020-10-27 00:00:00,8,Teens of all age can relate to this movie and it's amazing. I personally relate to this so much. But the ending was a bit quick. I don't think we can't bring out change over night. The ending could've been exhibited much better but the emotion in the movie is fantastic. It was an awe for me! Honestly would recommend for teens. Love it.... And actors did a great job!
" Don't watch this one. ok. I'm messing with you.
",0.296,0.9177,2020-10-11 00:00:00,10,OMG OMG OMG I can't relate better to any character than of Nadine. Felt every single moment like I was her. The awkward humor this movie has idk if many people like it but hey I'm messing with you. I'm not going to get in the techie details cause the flawless Hailee steals every single frame she is in which she literally is in. and always a happy ending is a happy ending.
" A brilliant light hearted comedy
",0.743,0.9856,2020-09-25 00:00:00,8,The edge of seventeen is a coming of age comedy drama. I really enjoyed this movie Hailee steinfield is absolutely perfect in playing this role with other great performances from other actors and actresses. A good film that you can enjoy with friends or family and it will keep you entertained from beginning to end. A feel good comedy to watch
" Immy's review : Enjoyable teen film
",0.4404,0.9957,2020-09-25 00:00:00,8,"Finally, a teen movie that got it right. 'Edge of Seventeen' was surprisingly clever with sharp screenplay and relatable characters, without coming across as overly preachy or annoying. The movie succeeds because it's actually self aware of Nadine's selfish personality and doesn't attempt to make her likeable, so we are never forced into the position of trying to root for the protagonist. Nadine was also relatable and realistic, as the film doesn't hold back in presenting all her flaws and insecurities, and thus she's a wonderfully human character. For example, her lack of social skills at parties, the tumultuous on and off relationship with her best friend, and her longing to stand out from this generation are all issues that teens go through. Edge of Seventeen strays far from glamorising the life of a young person, and in fact does the complete opposite, giving us a refreshing perspective of a seventeen year old. The performances were excellent, with special mention to Hailee Steinfield and Woody Harrelson. The film incorporated a perfect balance of comedy, drama and romance, neither of which fell flat. I especially loved the witty yet intriguing relationship between Nadine and her teacher, which offered something far deeper than at first glance. His character was played wonderfully and he added a lot of warmth to an otherwise rather sad movie. Superb direction, colourful characters and a self aware screenplay make this a great watch. Highly recommend."
" Smart but inconsequential
",0.2144,0.1062,2020-08-19 00:00:00,7,"It is a cool, above average movie. From the start, you feel the screenplay is witty, full of personality and unpredictable. However, the movie didn't quite grip me as I think movies should. I believe it's a good example of why a handful of thoughtful insights and punchlines put together are important, but if you lack that final touch, that X factor, it doesn't quite reach that high."
" very very relatable

" I Was a Teenage Self-Actualizer?
",0.0,-0.5927,2020-07-15 00:00:00,6,"A couple of things elevate this from a teenangster comedy.One is Woody Harrellson. The role is written for at least the silver, but he gets the gold.The other is how the director (in her debut, kudos) and young star help bring you close to but repel you from the main character.As a spoiler it's nice to see a narcissist have to be accountable for their actions. No I'm not looking in a mirror, nor at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Revenge of the Revenge of the Nerds? I dunno....was solid pandemic fluff."
" You Are Truly Never Alone
",0.5632,0.3457,2020-07-09 00:00:00,7,"This story speaks a lot about grief and loneliness and its evident after Nadine's best-friend starts dating her brother. What is good about this story is your never truly alone when dealing with loss of a parent or friend etc. There's always people out there who have or are going through the same things you are. The Cast did their job, Woody Harrelson character was my favourite. The main character herself Nadine I liked, actress Hailee Steinfeld did very well and the rest were good aswell.
Good film for all teenagers who feel lonely or have gone through a semblence of grief in their lives, will connect with this film."
" the world's most annoying and immature protagonist
",-0.4576,-0.5027,2020-07-01 00:00:00,1,"I couldn't stop myself from hating Nadine. The way she manipulates others with her suicide threats and others and mopes around feeling sorry for herself about how bad her life is when it hardly is. Her dad dies? It's completely understandable for her to be sad. Her best friend dates her brother? Big deal get over it. Also, what was even the actual plot of this? There hardly was one. Even the friendship with the teacher which I thought sounded heartwarming was a massive yawn. I think the title of this film should be renamed to Random Shots of the Life of Cringey, Immature Teen."

" The Edge of Seventeen
",0.0,0.9964,2020-05-15 00:00:00,7,"I found this film when it was broadcast on television, I remember the actress being fantastic with her Oscar nominated debut in the remake of True Grit, and now she's made the successful move into pop music, I was looking forward to seeing another well-rated film with her. Basically, Nadine Franklin (Golden Globe nominated Hailee Steinfeld) is a seventeen-year-old high school student living in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon. As a child, young Nadine (Lina Renna) was very close to her father Tom (Eric Keenleyside), and eventually found friendship with young Krista (Ava Grace Cooper). Unfortunately, when she was thirteen, she suffered tragedy when her father died of a heart attack. Since then, Nadine has had difficult relationships with her popular older brother Darian (Blake Jenner, Caitlyn's son) and her image conscious mother Mona (Kyra Sedgwick), but she maintains a strong friendship with Krista (Haley Lu Richardson). At Nadine's home, Darian throws a pool party where Nadine and Krista get drunk. Nadine falls asleep and Krista goes downstairs and talks to Darian. The next morning, Nadine finds Krista masturbating a naked Darian in bed, which puts a strain on their friendship. The next day, Darian and Krista run into each other, he asks her out. Nadine feels desperately alone, she turns to her classmate Erwin Kim (Hayden Szeto), who has a crush on her, but Nadine is attracted to older student Nick Mossman (Alexander Calvert). Darian invites Krista to a house party, but she insists Nadine join them. There, Nadine is left on her own when Krista is introduced to other students. After failing to mingle with anybody, Nadine sits outside, where a fellow partygoer makes an insulting remark. After Nadine leaves the party, she invites Erwin to an amusement park. He attempts to kiss her but is rejected. They still finish the date, and Nadine tells Erwin he is a great guy. At school, Krista confronts Nadine for ignoring her. Nadine tells her Darian does not really care about her and will eventually drop her. Krista retorts by telling Nadine that he has asked her to be his girlfriend and to be his date for the prom. Nadine makes her choose between herself and Darian. As Krista does not want to choose, Nadine feels betrayed and angrily ends their friendship. Nadine finds a source of support at school from her teacher, Max Bruner (Woody Harrelson). She vents to him, and he humorously teases her by admitting that she is his favourite student. Nadine has become lost due to not seeing Krista, she calls Erwin and invites herself round to his swimming pool, much to his excitement. Nadine realises he is rich showing up at his house and that he is an animation filmmaker and accepts his invitation to the school short-film festival. Following an argument, Mona brings Nadine with her to work. There, they continue to argue, during which Nadine's late father is mentioned; Mona tells Nadine that he would be extremely disappointed in the way she has turned out. Nadine angrily steals Mona's car and drives away. Feeling alone and desperate, she writes a sexually explicit text to Nick, but instead of deleting it, she accidentally sends it. Nadine confides in Mr. Bruner that she is going to kill herself after this has happened. But she is surprised and delighted when she receives a reply from Nick asking her out. After Nadine has got ready and snuck out, Mona returns to find the mess, and calls Darian tells him to find her. On their date, Nick kisses Nadine and repeatedly attempts to have sex with her in his car. Nadine rejects his advances, she assumed that he genuinely wanted to spend time with her and get to know her. Embarrassed and heartbroken, Nadine runs away and calls Mr. Bruner, who drives her to his house, with his wife (Meredith Monroe) and infant son. Darian arrives and tells Nadine that he has been pressured having responsibilities in their father's place, he says he feels trapped and has only applied to colleges nearby. Darian confesses that the only person who makes him happy is Krista. Nadine confesses her own feelings of self-hatred, intensified by her jealousy of Darian's popularity. They hug, ending their feud. As Nadine leaves for the film festival, she is met by Darian and Krista. Nadine and Krista reconcile and agree to catch up later. Realising that Mona is still worried about her, Nadine texts her that she is safe, and Mona decides to trust her. Erwin's animated film turns out to be a story about an alien boy who falls in love with a girl at high school but is rejected. Nadine apologises to Erwin for taking so long to accept his feelings for her. Erwin is congratulated by his colleagues, and introduces Nadine, she smiles and finally feels confident in herself. Also starring Nesta Cooper as Shannon and Christian Michael Cooper as young Darian. Steinfeld gives a fantastic show-stealing lead performance as the awkward teenager having agonising misadventures, including clashes with her mother and brother, having bad dates, tense friendships, and unrequited crushes. But there is also a terrific supporting cast, especially the brilliant Harrelson as the sarcastic droll teacher unafraid to bite back at Steinfeld's snappy digs, but also help her however he can, some of the best and funniest scenes are them bantering. This film steers away from teen movie clichés and make it feel really fresh, with a witty script perfectly capturing the often agonising teenage experience and complexities of growing up, with memorably funny and dramatic moments. It is aimed at the social media generation, but anyone can watch it, and you are guaranteed to laugh and wince in equal measure, a terrific coming-of-age comedy-drama. Very good!"
" Maybe Woody Harrelson greatest role
",0.6369,0.9937,2020-05-07 00:00:00,8,"SYNOPSIS:
Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) is a teenager going through the loss of her father, living with her annoyingly perfect brother, a fight with her best friend and everything else that comes with being a teenage girl. She struggles as she tries to find little things to make her happy and fit in.REVIEW:
This is some of the greatest writing in any film I've ever seen. It's so disgustingly realistic that I can literally sympathize with every character. I have this issue with films based around films that revolve around the life of a high schooler and it's either corny or not an accurate depiction of how teenagers act, but this film hits it on the nose. Then the humor in this film is catered directly for me. I don't know if it's the writing or the acting from Woody Harrelson or both that makes Mr. Bruner one of my single most favorite characters in any film. The sarcastic, dry humor is played like no other character I've ever seen. The chemistry between both Steinfeld and Harrelson works so well that I couldn't imagine anyone else in either of those roles. Hayden Szeto as Erwin was also really well done. I felt he was really this super nervous kid talking to a girl that he has a crush on. Quite possibly overly nervous, but I'm sure that's how some people are. One flaw I would have to say is the acting from Blake Jenner as Nadine's brother, Darian. He's not awful, but there wasn't much display in emotion, but more so an increase and decrease in volume of his voice depending on the situation. I do, however, really enjoy a couple of the final interactions between his character and Steinfeld's. This film is filled with laughs, sad moments, moments that you relate to down to the bone and just overall great dialogue. It's on Netflix as I post this, so if you haven't seen it already, add this to the top of your list. 8.7/10."
" Waste of time.
",-0.4215,0.8908,2020-05-06 00:00:00,4,"Where do I start? This movie sucks so bad , it makes staring at a wall for the next 2 hours seem more interesting.The film's name is ""the edge of seventeen"", yet it doesn't deal with one thing typical of that age, despite it trying to tackle more issues than the number of flavours of Baskin Robbins, keyword being ""trying"". It doesn't actually bother solving even a single one. Some issues include Nadine and her mother's broken relationship, her mother's habit of being a damsel in distress, Nadine's depression, etc.The film has Nadine, a girl on the edge of seventeen, have her bestie ""betray"" her by sleeping with her brother. She also had her dad die when she was 13, coz of reasons unspecified. So, basically, we get to watch her teenage angst and a bunch of crazy stuff happen to her for the entirety of the film spare the last few minutes ,where, with a little heart to heart with her bro, in which she tells him what we have been hearing for the entire duration of the film (she thinks she sucks.) , something her brother knew all too well ,and, bloop! Everything is fixed. The sun is shining, she is prettier, her mom's sweet and she has a boyfriend who's rich and popular, blah, blah, blah. You get it.Since the entire thing feels nothing more than a waste of time and energy, the entire support cast seems unnecessary, the stupidest been the teacher, though his filler jokes are the only thing the that helped me get through the damn thing. Well, those and Blake Jenner's cute looks. Sigh...Though, it does do one thing right: portray the teenage angst properly.While Hailee Steinfield did a great job, the five feet apart actress did awful. Honestly, I have no idea why they gave her the job in the first place.Moral of the story? Hugging Blake Jenner can make you popular and awesome and incredibly happy for no reason.The film has left nothing else to say."

I enjoy them so much! Every character is handled just fine. Especially the lead role Nadin! Oh I love her so much. And her brother is a great guy on screen also. To be honest, I earned a philosophy degree at uni and should not feel this type of film as they generally are shallow. But this one is gorgeous, just give me so much laugh during some very challenging moments in my life.With so many unforgettable characters that are both like able and relatable.

",-0.128,0.9869,2020-01-16 00:00:00,3,"So I don't really understand how so many people enjoyed this movie so much. I really don't.
Nadine starts by having a troublesome life by being bullied and the losing her father. The only person she has for everything is her childhood friend, who was the first to talk to her.
At this point I felt really empathetic for the lead character, but it doesn't last long.
I can understand the surprise in seeing your bestifriend and your friend hooking up first thing after a hangover, but the way she reacted was just childish - even for a teenager. She's almost 18 for goodness sake! How can the girl simply not feel an ounce of happiness for her childhood bestfriend? It's unbelievable.
She complains about a friend changing and ""abandoning"" her, but at the end of the day all she feels is jealousy. Her friend tried to continue their friendship, but she is the one who couldn't accept this new chapter in her friend's life. What does she do immediatly after hearing the news?
Flirt with a guy, and then with another, nicer guy. The ""happy ending"" she got happened when the guy introduced her to others, just like her brother did to her best friend. This to me just proves how this girl is living in a world where everything has to be about her, and only her.
Let's remember that the movie showed us how the friend had a difficult childhood as well, so why can't Nadine accept her happiness away from her?
It's, to simply put it, a broken girl who could never deal with her emotions and past traumas porperly (at one point she even stoles her mother's car), but a sadstory does not excuse this girl's behabviour.
Simply selfish, blaming the world but not herself."
" What a GREAT movie!

I had heard good reviews but I am happy to report that unlike most movies of this genre, my expectations were surpassed greatly. I was exactly 10 minutes in when I whispered aloud, ""Wow, this is already a great movie."" And it continued to be great all the way up until the credit began rolling at the end.The story line itself was quite a simply and slightly over done one but I never once got that feeling while watching this movie. I have a habit of trying to predict what happens next and I loved that for the majority of this film, I was wrong.MASSIVE shoutout to the screenwriter, because the even the simplest of lines were written in a way that made you feel things deeply.The characters were so so so so developed. I felt like I was watching someone's life unfold and that these weren't just characters on a screen. I have to mention Nadine: so often I see movies where we have a main character who is innocent in everything that happens to them and just watches their life fall apart around them. Nadine however, was pretty much responsible for the mess that unfolded and I loved that. I loved the heavily flawed main character that actually drives the plot. Mad love to Kelly Fremon Craig and the rest of the crew."

I blame my asian friend for being old-fashioned. Also I blame this person I always wanted to bang for trying to bang me. Yeah can't help it, it's just me being a 17 year old girl"""

" A well told story
",0.2732,0.9951,2019-11-22 00:00:00,8,"What an unexpected little surprise of a movie. What feels like it should have been merely a sarcastic but amusing teen comedy by its trailers ends up being a surprisingly affecting exploration of loss, friendship, and family.Nadine is an awkward girl with a single friend, Krista. They're alone against the world, scoffing at everyone else's phoniness, especially Nadine's older brother who bears every outward sign of a jock save a letter jacket. The friend and the brother hook up one night, throwing Nadine's entire sense of meaning out the window as her authentic friend begins to really like the inauthentic Darian. Now, Nadine, who's been alone against the world with her best friend, is simply alone against the world.There's a running gag through the film that really highlights Nadine's situation really well. She can't drive. She failed her driving test and she's completely reliant on other people to get her from one place to another. When she was best friends with Krista, that was no problem. She always had a ride. When Nadine ends that relationship, she has to rely on her mother, who has her own stresses stemming from Nadine's father's death a few years prior. Nadine considers herself independent, but she's always relying on other people to simply get to school.There's one teacher that comes to the fore in this tale of high school, Mr. Bruner, played by Woody Harrelson. He gives equally sarcastic responses to Nadine, seemingly unconcerned with her plight which he views with disdain. It's only when she ends up making some really bad decision at the nadir of her situation and she reaches out for help outside of school that we see Mr. Bruner open up to her. His sarcastic exterior seemed to be hiding a similarly empty existence as Nadine, but he's actually quite the happy guy at home. Nadine sees that she can keep who she is but live a happy life away from her best friend at the same time.It's not a complicated movie. It's simply a well told story, and it works really well."

It's a very beautiful, occasionally dark story, and it was handled well by both crew and cast. The acting was good, and there were many strong performances, which was a change of pace compared to many teen movies, and the story was able to juggle both the lighter subjects and the darker subjects without it completely falling apart, and everything just felt so realistic, especially with the relationships between the characters. The genuine storytelling arc that didn't have a corny ""good guys win and the bad guys lose"" ending was a breath of fresh air, and I'll definitely find myself watching this movie more than once.

It can be tough to make one film stand out from the hundreds of similar others out there, but ""The Edge of Seventeen"" does just that. ""Seventeen"" feels like a John Hughes film for the 2010s; the situations are realistic and relatable, the humor feels fresh and fun, the characters are delightfully likeable, and the way the characters change throughout the film feels natural. This is, in my opinion, the very best kind of coming of age film because it feels so very balanced: the drama doesn't set the stakes super high, but the events are life changing for our protagonist; the humor is situational and character-based, making that humor feel more natural; the characters are flawed but they still have characteristics that make them sympathetic. Movies like this- that show the real, honest pain of growing up as well as the giddy fun parts- are rare enough to be called phenomenon."

" Not just teen angst
",0.0,0.9872,2019-07-10 00:00:00,7,"As many reviewers have stated, the main character Nadine is more then just going through growing pains. She shows signs of deeper emotional problems that go way beyond losing her father.
Almost all of Nadine's problems are brought on by her own actions. And when one is unaware that they are the problem, it will continue. Unfortunately here, she does a complete 180, over the coarse of a night. I didn't like that. But maybe time constraints prohibited from telling this gradually.
One of the strongest disagreements I've seen in reviews has been over her life long friend. To me this might have been the ONLY thing Nadine was justified at feeling betrayed. Key is lifelong friend. Who we see in one scene is actually targeting her brother. Then in the next she's found in bed with him. Then in the next she's all mushy mushy with a girl who wouldn't talk to her before. So yes Nadine, giving her an ultimatum was probably not the right next move, but never speaking to her again would have been. You just don't do that to friends.
I found Woody to be a great choice in a supporting but important role as a very grounding and level headed teacher.
Hailee Steinfeld's performance once again shows she's a force now, and in the future.
Though the ending was to quick at resolve, it was definitely worth a watch"

It's a common theme, but this one is elevated by a sharp, witty script and a bunch of excellent performances. Chief among these is Hailee Steinfeld as Nadine. She is amazing as a girl who's high-energy desperation makes you feel like she's about to explode through her own skin.Nadine is a wonderfully real character, awkward and angry and funny and sad and, down deeper, reasonably decent for a teenager. She deals with the LIFE OR DEATH problems of teenagehood, like getting in a fight with a friend, being ignored by the really hot guy, and figuring out what to do about the not-as-hot guy nervously chatting you up.The movie begins with a scene of her bantering with a sardonic teacher played wonderfully by Woody Harrelson, and their conversations are wonderfully prickly and offbeat.I do have a couple of quibbles. First, it's not entirely convincing that someone as attractive as Steinfeld would be ignored as thoroughly. Yes, attractive people can be shy and awkward, but an attractive girl is going to get some level of attention beyond one geeky guy.Second, the ending feels like an unrealistically abrupt transformation. It's emotionally satisfying but annoyingly unconvincing.But overall this movie is terrific and you should watch it."

We've all come to the point where our pessimistic side is stronger than our optimistic side. But what makes this movie so great, is that we can relate to it much more than we think we would do.

Woody Harrelson acts as Nadine's mentor throughout the movie and is the tipping point for her realization that life is not all that it seems. Haley Lu Richardson playing Nadine's bestfriend and Blake Jenner playing Nadine's brother Darion, both having great arcs and played very believable by the actors. Overall The Edge of Seventeen surprised me with how smart the comedy was and how great all the actors did, which it not common in this genre.

She has had only one friend in her whole childhood and a great relationship with her dad. But had he lived longer, would he have seen what was happening? Nadine is seriously depressed, anxious, socially awkward, and hates herself. The mother is useless and never realizes that her daughter needs counseling..
I know it's just a movie, but I'm very aware of the warning signs of mental illness. The writers and producers, however, don't seem to. As in all movies, I'm sure there will be a quick and happy ending. Can't wait to see it. But in real life It's not so easy.

And they remain best friends from the second grade to their junior year in high school. However, when Krista starts dating Darian, Nadine's world falls apart. So to combat her lonliness she attempts to socialize more with others which, due to her lack of social skills, leads to one bizarre scenario after the other. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an uneven film which featured a stark contrast between the drama and the comedy. Although it was certainly watchable, I thought that the constant sarcasm on the part of Nadine was over-played to a certain degree which detracted from the film more than anything else. In any case, while it wasn't a bad movie by any means, I honestly thought it could have been better and I have rated it accordingly. Average."

The movie gives a realistic view of what seventeen year old girls go through in high school and everyone should watch it because of this.In The Edge of Seventeen, the main character Nadine, loses a friend because her only friend ends up dating her older brother, ""I can't help how I feel Nadine."" This obviously upsets her and she has no idea what to do. Her friend was her support in high school, so she figures she needs that support again and goes to her teacher one day during lunch for advice to meet new people. She shares her very opinionated words with this teacher about how she dislikes high school and her life at the moment, ""I don't really have any friends, at the moment, and, to be completely honest with you, i'm not interested at all. At all. My entire generation is a bunch of mouthbreathers."" She also makes it very clear that she dislikes life, ""I don't want to take up a ton of your time, but i'm going to kill myself. I just thought an adult should know."" She is clearly miserable because she lost her best friend, now she has no friends, hinting at the fact that she needs advice to find a friend so she won't be this lonely. The teacher, not very good at giving advice, gives it a shot, ""Life's about taking risks. Don't be afraid to put yourself out there."" She takes his advice and meets a new friend named Erwin, who becomes pretty fond of Nadine, but in the long run they end up staying friends. Erwin becomes the supportive friend that Nadine needs because she's still devastated that Krista would do this to her. She's not only mad at Krista, but also at her brother for doing this because her brother has been there for her for the longest time, for her whole life. Even though they had a normal brother and sister hatred for each other, they still supported each other. Nadine feels like they both basically betrayed her.Nadine also has her mom that supports her when everything is happening to her, ""When I get mad I get really quiet and really still and I say to myself 'Everyone in the world is as miserable as you are. They are just better at pretending'."" This is really good advice to give to Nadine so she doesn't feel alone with what she's dealing with, so she isn't that lonely. Nadine makes many mistakes when trying to impress a boy that she has a crush on, and Erwin is there for her when her heart gets broken, and when she makes mistake, like any caring and supportive friend should. Erwin introduces her to some of his friends at the end of the movie, and all problems are solved.The Edge of Seventeen includes a great learning experience for teenagers or anyone that watches it, however the ending was a bit rushed and all of the problems were solved rather quickly, but still a great movie!"

",-0.3506,0.7205,2019-02-27 00:00:00,3,"The first 3/4 of the movie are completely enthralling, there's no doubt about that. It's a whirlwind of events and life's curveballs, conflict that only gets worse and messier as the plot goes on, all building to the climax, which is meant to be the protagonist's catharsis.So then why is Nadine, the one who has been beaten down the most without remorse, the only one apologizing at the end? The brother who treats her like garbage and says unforgivable things makes no effort at an apology, instead his only resolution is a single hug he gives her when he accepts her apology *for her entire life*. And the mother who has emotionally abused her for as long as she can remember? Well her non-apology comes in the form of deleting an angry text she's about to send, instead simply letting her be.And then there's the lifelong friend who betrayed her trust in the first place. What does she do, other than deny any responsibility for abandoning a friend in an unfamiliar atmosphere at the party when she's supposed to be trying to make amends for screwing Nadine's brother? No really, I'd like to know, because that's the last meaningful interaction they have. Nadine gets ditched, and when she holds Krista accountable all she says is that's not what happened. The next interaction they have is in the last minutes of the movie, and it's as emotionless and simple as just accepting that they're maybe talking again.The only person who makes any progress in the entire movie is Nadine, and nobody else is held accountable at all. It's nice in the sense of yay the movie ends on a good note for her, but the character is left with a still toxic family who accept her apology and offer none of their own, which isn't exactly inspiring for any imagined epilogue."

With seeing some great performances I also witnessed a movie that is written and directed in such a perfect way for the genre, making something special and real. It's not a movie for everyone but I found it great, I didn't feel happiness until the very end but I believe that was the right thing to do with the story of the coming of age story, showing the life of Nadine through personal loss and depression, it was written with an realistic mind set, making us see in detail of what kind of unlikeable person she sadly is but ultimately realizes and improves in every way to become likeable to friends and family. Excellent writing from Kelly Fremon Craig.The ensemble cast is well put together, no one delivers a bad performances, there were only believable ones. Hailee Seinfeld stands out the most as I wrote before, she's the heart of the movie and does an incredible job as the lead. Everything is perfect, couldn't be better. I recommend it for people they like strong acting and a movie with a good message, showing how hard people can have it in their homes. It's really for all ages but mainly under mid twenties to teenagers is what I would guess. I enjoyed it quite a bit."

" Must Watch Movie
",0.0,0.9201,2019-02-21 00:00:00,9,"The Edge of Seventeen is a very bittersweet movie about a 17 year old named Nadine (Hailee Steinfield), who is trying to navigate her way through the awkward years of high school. Life at home is rather difficult as she often feels inferior to her popular older brother, Darian (Blake Jenner), and she can't seem to get along with her mother, Mona (Kyra Sedgwick). Every thing seems to fall apart when her best friend, Krista (Haley Lu Richardson), begins dating her older brother. At this point, Nadine is only able to find reassurance through her friendship with her history teacher/mentor, Mr. Bruner, and her compassionate classmate, Erwin Kim. The Edge of Seventeen is a must watch movie that incorporates important social issues, good humor, exceptional acting, and well thought out cinematography to keep the audience engaged.
Throughout the movie, depression plays a big role in the life of the main character. Depression is a relevant sickness that many people deal with today. In one scene, Nadine takes a pill then coincidentally receives a phone call from her classmate, Erwin Kim. She answers the call in a monotone voice saying that she will call him later and abruptly hangs up. After realizing her rudeness, she calls Erwin back and explains to him that she just took an antidepressant pill and is waiting for the effects to kick in. Nadine goes on to ask him if he thinks she is pathetic, and he responds by insisting that she is perfectly fine. This scene normalizes depression and shows teen viewers that it is okay to not always be ""fine"". Another social issue touched upon is misunderstood teenagers. Teens often feel misunderstood and alone, and this problem is highlighted in the movie. Nadine is frequently misunderstood by her mom. They have a complicated relationship where they never see eye to eye leading Nadine to feel alone as she doesn't get along with her brother either. Darian, her brother, also feels misunderstood because his whole family began to rely on him once the father passed away. They think of him as the ""rock"" of the family although deep down inside he can barely keep it together. Juggling his social life at school while dealing with the wrath of his sister and being the personal emotional support system to his mother, Darian's life isn't as perfect as everyone thinks it to be.
Acting plays a big factor in the movie. Hailee Steinfield is given the difficult task of playing a depressed and unhappy seventeen year old. With the help of some makeup work, and her sassy, sometimes sarcastic attitude, she is able to portray a seemingly helpless teen who thinks the world hates her. Her use of sarcasm also helps to add to the humor of the movie because there are many scenes where she sarcastically jokes around making a seemingly serious moment more lighthearted. On the other hand, Blake Jenner uses his manly charisma to play a very confident character with a tough personality, with the exception of one scene. During one scene, Blake's character, Darian, has a very intense conversation with Nadine. Both actors become vulnerable and their characters are able to share a connection which ends up changing the feelings of the movie. The camera work also helps theses actors portray their characters. When it is a rather intense or touching moment, the camera will be zoomed in and there will be no background noise. This helps the audience focus their attention on what is going on. Interestingly, the movie doesn't use effectively use music as a tool to help evoke emotion. This is surprising considering The Edge of Seventeen is a movie directed at teens who's lives happen to be heavily influenced by music.
Overall, I would rate this movie a solid 9/10. It is a great movie but I would not recommend it to younger children. Some of the humor is more mature and there are some inappropriate scenes and foul language. I would recommend this coming of age movie to all teenagers because it provides valuable lessons such as always be yourself and always put your family first. Me being a teenager, this movie also reminded me that although you may believe you are alone in this world, there is always someone who understands you."
" Just Wow.
",0.5859,0.9863,2019-02-21 00:00:00,10,"Ok I was just wowed by this movie. Hailee Steinfeld plays awkward and dramatic Nadine so well, and she delivers with so much emotion, I definitely felt her pain. Hailey Lu Anderson is so adorable and her character Krista felt like a genuine best friend, she really portrayed love towards Nadine. I think a lot of people probably questioned Nadine's relationship with her teacher (Woody Harrelson), about whether it crosses any lines and I definitely don't think so, there seemed to be a real bond of friendship there as well. It was such a real movie and didn't feel forced or over the top, but like a real life situation. Total 10/10, very amazing and sincere film.-certifiedstonedreview"
" On the Edge of Merit
",0.4215,0.8949,2019-02-19 00:00:00,5,"'The Edge of Seventeen' throws high school misfit Nadine into emotional turmoil when her popular older brother Darian begins dating BFF Krista. Nadine's customary smouldering resentment is fanned into a white-hot blaze of jealousy which propels her into greater isolation, as she makes a difficult situation worse through needless conflicts and unwise choices. The film has an original slant, but dilutes much of its potential by repeatedly going in search of easy laughs and tear-jerking.The acting is above average for this kind of project, but Nadine's relationships with both Krista and Darian are given perfunctory treatment, and the script's main narrative arc and various sub-plots are utterly predictable. The direction could have exercised more self-restraint at dramaric moments, while it could have used more flair when depicting Nadine's everyday life. At the end of the day, the final product seems like a lost opportunity for a decent idea."
" Jocks are People Too
",0.0,0.9925,2019-02-13 00:00:00,6,"Well, don't judge a movie by whether you like the characters. Judge it by whether the characters are realistic. Because people are not always likeable in real life. But their story can still be compelling.
So while our protagonist may have been self-absorbed and overly dramatic, was she believable as a modern teen? I think she was.
Keep in mind that this is just another in a series of one billion films about Godless people with empty lives. But that's who writes and directs many films. People write about what they know.
Having a dorky Asian high school male character was refreshing. I also like that our main girl gives him a chance.
But what was the most refreshing was the portrayal of the popular jock older brother as actually a pretty solid guy who is the glue of the family. Two thumbs up for the reliability of alpha males. Meanwhile, he also gets a chance to share his own frustration at needing to be the rock of the family. Of course he looked way too old and mature for high school.
As others have noted, the lead actress is reasonably attractive and quick-witted. Those of us who were neither in high school may have a hard time understanding why she has such low self esteem. If only we had her assets when we were young.Nevertheless, low self esteem is often in the eye of the beholder. Meaning that people look down on themselves for a variety of complex and subjective reasons that others may never understand. It is what it is.The story did a good job of having the supporting characters remind our main character that she was being unreasonable, overly dramatic, and selfish.I agree with other reviewers that it's a sad commentary on modern culture that teens judge the value of their lives based on whether they have a romantic partner. But loneliness and desire are powerful forces, and if there is no other narrative to balance out that potential void, it will consume a person who doesn't have the gravitas to see it in perspective.I didn't notice any music. Meanwhile others say that the music was significant. It made zero impression on me.There is no nudity, limited sexual references, and less profanity than in most films. But this film is not for the socially conservative. The main girl speaks her mind, including describing sexual fantasies and scenarios.
I've never seen the lead in anything prior. But she seems quite talented and natural. Good performance with the material she had to work with."

" Heartbreakingly accurate portrayal of teenage years
",-0.4215,0.4646,2019-02-11 00:00:00,8,Hailee Steinfeld is amazing in the role of awkward Nadine. I loved that her awkwardness wasn't played off as cute adorable rambling like they usually do in films. I felt like the awkward things she said or did were really accurate. My heart was breaking for Nadine as you watch her make mistake after mistake because she just can't seem to understand how to handle the problems in her life. This is truly a coming of age story but one that actually delves into mental illness without making it a major part of the film. She is clearly suffering from anxiety and depression from the passing of her father and can't seem to work through it on her own. This film was an absolute gem and Woody Harrelson was perfect in his comedic role.
" Hailee Steinfeld part/role was perfect 10/10 A+
",0.5719,0.9873,2019-02-10 00:00:00,5,This was not the greatest movie but it wasn't worst either. Hailee steinfeld character was the best. In the movie or in reality the friend should've never did what she did or vice versa the brother should've never did what he did. Neither one should have done what they did. I don't blame Nadine for the way she responded or anything she did in response. That was or is a line that friends and siblings just do not cross. This would be a good educational movie if an adult with good morals is present and tells the kids watching you don't ever do what Nadine friend and brother did. You just do not ever cross that line.

I'll admit I even teared up.The main character at times can be unlikeable, yes but, I think those that don't understand the feeling of not feeling good enough won't understand why she is the way she is.It is inspiring to a point as well. She starts off making many mistakes but in the end starts to turn things around for the better.I think her character is very relatable to teens or adults who experienced loss and issues with self esteem.I fully enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to friends."
" Get over yourself.
",0.0,-0.0957,2019-02-03 00:00:00,5,"This wasn't a horrible movie, it just had a plot that, while probably true, I didn't want to see. Nadine, the main character is supposed to be the withdrawn and socially awkward sister of the most popular boy in school. She grows to resent him for it and they fight. Nadine has one good friend though who... of course.. falls for the brother. This sets off a rage spiral in Nadine. Now alone without her besty she flounders for a while - learning some hard lessons.. you know the drill. I could relate to every aspect of this movie but... I can't say I had a good time.
First problem for me was that Haliee Steinfield was just too good looking to play an awkward loner. Second problem was that Woody Harrelson was a stand out as Nadine's teacher - but he wasn't in the movie that much. Honestly I wanted to see those two in a movie. Thirdly, though I related to this flick, Nadine's problems make her look childish and they are entirely self made. We probably all went though it but it doesn't mean I want to see it on screen."

Reasonably attractive and maybe a tad introverted but not shy necessarily, and they are hardly that awkward. In this film, however, while the leads are all attractive, it's their personalities and actions that shake things up. Stuttering and weird timing contributed to the surplus of almost cringey awkwardness (in a good way). There was the inclusion of consuming teen depression and also the difficulty some people have when it comes to connecting with other individuals. As someone who dealt with things like this as a teenager, it was comforting to finally see it represented in a mainstream film. Well done."
" Very good teen movie

Her father died unexpectedly of a heart attack when she was 13 years old and her mom is more fond of Nadine's brother Darian(played by Blake Jenner)as he is more popular and attentive than Nadine is. But things get even more complicated when Nadine's childhood friend Krista(played by Haley Lu Richardson)starts dating Nadine's brother causing her relationship with her friend in jeopardy and from there she gets super jealous of her brother's success and her low life. However Nadine later befriends Erwin who secretly has a crush on her.
But back to Nadine's life will she finally make amends with her estranged brother and mother(played by Kydra Sedgwick) as well as getting it with Erwin?
Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as I caught I on Netflix today. It reminds me of John Hughes films like The Breakfast Club where the director of this film Kelly Fremon Craig borrowed elements from John Hughes. The acting is great,the soundtrack is very good and I liked the story which deals with emotions,guilt,betrayal as well as being an introvert.

" So Relatable
",0.0,0.9796,2018-12-21 00:00:00,9,"The Edge of Seventeen is a movie I stumbled upon. I did not know what to watch next and saw this movie available to stream. Once I started watching I absolutely fell in love with this movie. It's a coming of age story that could not be more real about the life of a teenager. The movie is awkward, funny, sad, frustrating, and emotional, and that's exactly what being a teenager is. Hailee Steinfeld perfectly plays a character that I've seen has been labeled unlikable. I read other reviews and some just say that ""she is unlikeable and thinks she's way hotter and funnier than she really is."" And that's absolutely right, her character, Nadine spends most of the movie not knowing why she feels so frustrated. She just is. And me being a teenager myself I know that is absolutely accurate. Sometimes I just feel angry because I do, and sometimes I'm really anxious and awkward without wanting to. This is the first movie in which I have really seen myself reflected onscreen. The main character is a teenage girl, but this movie is so greatly written that it isn't only relatable to girls but to all teenagers in general like it happened to me being a guy. The whole arc the character goes through is not about her changing everything about herself, but about recognizing that everyone has problems and everyone feels all of those emotions she feels. The dialogue was perfectly written, it reflected everything about being this age. The performances were amazing, Hailee Steinfeld is a really talented actress.
I was genuinely surprised about how great this movie was. It's such a relatable and heartwarming story that at times may feel a little irritable or all over the place, but that's just what being a teen is."

Nadine is all kinds of awkward and that's what makes her relatable and adorable. You empathize with her and the problems she's going through, and through the eyes of an adult, of course you laugh at how overdramatic she is, but in a FUNNY way. It makes for some comedic relief between her and her teacher delightfully played Woody Harrelson, who just ignores her neuroses. What makes the film a pleasant experience is the way she is played by Hailee Steinfeld. There's a few minutes here and there where they venture into 'I will punch you' category, but nowhere near the insufferable 'lady bird' I had to turn off after ten minutes. Definitely a recommended film for those who empathize with growing pains."

She in my opinion is the one who deserved this be said about her acting in this movie; if anyone can steal greatness in cinematic acting from from all the combined and various movie performances of Meryl Streep, Jody Foster, and Sally Field, altogether, Hailee Steinfeld did it in one performance in one movie of one hour and fourty-five minutes, which is shorter than other movies that allow more time for the acting to shine.

",0.743,0.9541,2018-08-18 00:00:00,9,"Hey, guys. This evening, I watched ""The Edge of Seventeen"" with Hailee Steinfeld, and it was pretty good. A true story about a 17 year old high girl as a school junior who feels more alone than ever in her life. This movie is passionately. Hailee Steinfeld did a good fabulous job as Nadine. Her performance is really inspired with some energy to it. For example, Nadine felt aghast when this guy Nick tried to kiss her, but her couldn't let him to touch her ""You-Know-What"", gets out of his car and cries her tears. Like me, I felt more aghast than Nadine. I know there are some depressing scenes like I was talking about. But I think it is the truly real-life and coming-of-age story. I will give a recommendation to ""The Edge of Seventeen"". I did enjoyed it and I praysed it a lot. It's seems dramatic, but very enjoyable."

Beautifully done cinematography, brilliant set of cast, a strong story and a very well executed film this was. This film really left me with an heartwarming experience.

You get a peep-shot straightaway with the yellow border and black font as to what kind of movie this is going to be: edgy, with seventeen-year-oldsDespite not knowing even what a PetLand was, I felt more connected to The Edge of Seventeen more than I have any other teen movie in a long time. It probably helps that I am seventeen. It plays so truthfully to the gross, weird adolescent experience that I felt like some scenes held up a mirror to my sloppy hair-bunned face and said, ""Look! Look, everyone is just as awkward and miserable as you are.""The beginning is cliched, but forgivable because it provides a quick pocket of exposition that reveals enough to allow viewers to understand Nadine's reactions. The dialogue is biting and earns more than just a nostril snort, and most importantly, reminiscent of how teenagers actually speak to one another. Characters tackle several tropes: brother dating best-friend, bad-boy, nerd-who-has-a-crush-on-me, and the all-important teen movie party scene with all the finesse that real teenagers would possess.It's hard to speak about what makes this movie so real, so cringey, and so well-done. That's probably why I am not a movie critic. However, I can say that it strikes that perfect balance with awkward, cringey scenes (like someone getting an unsolicited kiss on a Ferris wheel) by using jokes that don't cheapen the severity of the situation, but rather diffuse it, just like real life. Characters fumble through with some forgivable mistakes that I could see becoming fond adulthood bar stories.Instead of making caricatures and grotesquely dramatic scenes, it imbues that same heartfelt humanity in awkward, painful, and ""yikes"" scenes that radiates through the rest of the film. In no scene does this film make the characters over-react for the sake of tension. All characters, not just the titular whiny Nadine, suffer humilations, desires, and motivations. That allows them all to develop and break out of the stereotypes that usually plague secondary characters.Edge of Seventeen also tackles a tumultuous familial relationship, with an eventual reconciliation (spoiler, but come on. It's a coming-of-age movie.) that doesn't feel forced and unnatural. Waterfalls don't come pouring out of one another's eyes in a sobbed apologies. It is awkward, but charming. It leaves you with that glimmer of hope that follows every awkward familial apology after a Desert Storm level fight-that your family, and the argument, aren't fixed, but they're not inflamed. It's healing.So, yeah. I've never sucked dick in a PetLand. But neither has Nadine.I give this movie 10 Hell Yeahs."

Well, no... this is an excellent film for even, yes, 'old' people like me!What I really liked about it is that the main character Nadine (played by an excellent Ms Steinfeld) is basically, a dickhead (someone even plays a little tune that says as much to her at one point!)... she's arrogant, constantly on the defensive, thinks the whole world is bullying her... when, in actual fact, she is treating people in the exact opposite of the way she would like to be treated herself. Yet still you feel for her... she's a messed up kid doing her best and making wrong decisions all the time. Well, that sounds like me in my teenage years! ;o)The supporting cast are great as well... Woody Harrelson in particular (but we all know Woody is always awesome...) It's a terrific film, well worth a watch regardless of your age. Very funny, often moving, give it a go!"

There's no great epiphany or life altering event that suddenly makes her a better person. She gets told off once and flips the switch suddenly. Unbelievable. There is nothing about this girl that is relatable. Geez, The bad boy has more sense than she does. I don't see why it has good reviews."
" An emotional rollercoaster for loners of any age
",-0.0772,-0.0693,2018-06-28 00:00:00,9,"Though this film fits the coming of age genre the struggles that Nadine, the main character, is going through are not purely 'teen problems', As a 20 something year old this film deeply resonated with me and though similar to Nadine I was a socially awkward, defensive and pessimistic teenager it wasn't just the teenage me who could find the character relatable. I've noticed in the low rated comments one of the main reasons people didn't like the film is because the main character isn't likeable. And though I loved the film, I would agree; she isn't likeable. And the film is more realistic and better off for it. In real life we aren't always likeable people ourselves and the film almost acts as a tool to allow us to step back and really look at our current or teenage selves. Nadine does realise and understand towards the end and throughout the film her erratic and selfish behaviour is a result of her self loathing because she knows she doesn't want to continue being that way but she's stuck in this endless cycle and doesn't know how to get out. The valuable lesson from the film and her journey within it is that we often bring misfortune and unhappiness on ourselves in the way we handle and respond to bad things in our lives. I think this film will speak to anyone who has felt alone in the world, lost without purpose or anywhere to fit in. If you like films about people rather than action and you watch a film to be taken on a journey (albeit an emotional one) rather than to have an enjoyable couple of hours then this may be the film for you. It helps that is has an excellent cast, each actor fitting their roles well and bringing them to life.Another positive note I took away from the film is the way it handles and represents mental illness/ distress as it does so without labels and in a subtle way without needing to bring it to the forefront."

When her best friend since childhood, Krista, takes up with her hated older brother Darian, Nadine feels even more isolated than usual, and her Drama Queen antics lead in an even more negative direction than usual.Hailee Steinfeld plays Nadine, and I have rather liked this young woman's performances since she first exploded in the Coen Brothers' True Grit. In this movie, she plays Nadine brilliantly.The trouble is that Nadine is not very likeable and not very believable. She actually has quite a nice life, being well provided for by her single-parent mother, and also enjoying the fact that her brother takes on various parental roles, notwithstanding normal sibling antagonism.So when she utterly selfishly forces her best friend to make the choice of her brother or her, she loses any audience sympathy she may have had, and it wasn't much to start with. And the sequence where she accidentally sends a sexually explicit text to a boy she fancies, goes out with him when he responds, and is then horrified when he expects her to deliver on the text - well, words failed me, notwithstanding ""No"" means ""no."".Perhaps it's an accurate reflection of teenage angst, but it's quite different to the teenage angst I went through.And the resolution of the film was glib beyond belief - here is a youngster, who on the basis of what the film shows us, has been somewhat socially inept, or worse, since childhood, and all of a sudden she develops a sunny disposition towards others simply because of some home truths and a new friendship? I don't buy it. She should be in counselling.If it's not obvious, let me spell it out: the trailer sells this as a teen comedy, but it's not. It's a character-driven drama, albeit with some amusing moments. A slight and everyday drama, to be sure, but a drama nevertheless. The trailer deceives.It's not all negative. As well as Steinfeld's undoubted skill in selling her character, the film also benefits from Woody Harrelson as a humorously cynical teacher, and the luminously lovely Haley Lu Richardson as Krista, some decent support work among the rest of the cast, and sufficient interest in the characters to keep your attention throughout."

",0.0,0.9201,2018-05-09 00:00:00,8,"This was such a sweet, funny movie. It's very reminiscent of a John Hughes type of film, a film that's great for teenagers and adults. Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic as a teenager dealing with loneliness, social awkwardness, and buried grief. As often is the case in teen movies, her main parental figure (her mother) is a bit of a ridiculous mess, so she turns to her teacher played by Woody Harrelson, who's also great in his role. This story manages to address family issues at home, dating woes, friendship conflict, jealousy, and more. It walks the line between drama and comedy, serving up some very touching moments AND some big laughs. That's a tricky balance to achieve and this film succeeds with flying colors."
" Straight forward look at reality
",0.2263,-0.0709,2018-05-08 00:00:00,10,"Kudos to Kelly Fremon Craig for her writing and direction of this coming-of-age drama that features well placed moments of humor. Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) is a 17-year-old that feels very awkward and is still grieving the death of her father after four years. Her closest friend is Krista (Haley Lu Richardson) in this edgy dynamic of high school society. Things become a bit more twisted when Nadine finds out that Krista is secretly dating Nadine's detested older brother, Darian (Blake Jenner). It is not like Nadine has exactly lost her only friend. When she suffers her day-to-day tragic problems, she rushes to the classroom of Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson) and unloads on him as he casually tries to eat his lunch; Nadine is berating him and insulting him with little mercy as this is the way she calms herself down. Miss Steinfeld is absolutely tremendous in this role. Playing her role so seamlessly; so fresh and even genuine. And you get no idea Steinfeld is actually 19 years old playing a girl two years younger. For Harrelson, no one could play his part any better. His devotion to a troubled student, all the while he himself has life problems of his own.Rounding out the cast: Alexander Calvert, Nesta Cooper, Hayden Szeto and Kyra Sedgwick."

Main points of the plot is, High schooler Greg, she spends most of his time making parodies of classic movies with his co-worker Earl, finds his outlook forever altered after befriending a classmate who has just been diagnosed with cancer. 
I think that's the normal junior girl life. That happens simple life. Hailee Steinfeld actor's ability is increasing. She plays good that movie. That give't me other realize. I watch'tr any other meanings for that movie. I watched theatre.

" A disappointment
",-0.5106,0.9496,2018-05-03 00:00:00,2,"The Edge of Seventeen has many strong, positive aspects. The acting, by Hailee Steinfeld as Nadine and Kyra Sedgwick as her mother, Mona, was outstanding. Woody Harrelson nailed the part of the burned out teacher, Mr. Bruner. Actually, Hailee Steinfeld carried the movie as the lost and disturbed Nadine, making her into a character we can sympathize with. The high school was realistically rendered both physically, and in terms of the general student population. The end of the movie was well done with Nadine working out issues with her brother, Darian, played by Blake Jenner.
 On the other hand, there were glaring flaws in this production that cannot be overlooked. First of all, the script was often lacking in substance. Do teenagers really talk that disrespectfully as Nadine does with both family and friends? Also, why has no teacher, coach, principal, or counselor gotten help for Nadine? She was unhappy, or disturbed, depending how you look at it from kindergarten through 11th grade. The death of her father only made things worse. After all, she lived in an upper middle class neighborhood and attended schools that seemed to have everything. Why had nobody noticed how unhappy and lost this girl was? This was unrealistic. And why hadn't Mr. Bruner, her history teacher gotten her help from a counselor? He was obviously ill equipped to help Nadine himself.
 The boy Erwin was well portrayed by Hayden Szeto, but it seems unrealistic to have Nadine take a sudden interest in him as a boyfriend at the end when she had previously made it quite clear that she only wanted him as a friend. There was no build up for this. The end was well done but there should have been more than one night between the mixed up Nadine and the totally transformed Nadine of the last scene."

In my opinion if you feel struggled you should talk somebody and have some advice.That time you will understand what to do."
" Exploits then trivializes serious mental disorders
",-0.5719,-0.5049,2018-04-22 00:00:00,1,"Nadine is the kind of ""unlikable"" character that critics love (her mother is a close second). It means that this is serious cinema that challenges you because it's so unpleasant to watch (wanting to watch something enjoyable is so plebeian.).She's abrasive, rude, obnoxious, unstable, attention-seeking and indulges in dangerous, even life-threatening behavior. Some might even call her toxic. OK, so far so good. Handled skillfully this could be the making of a compelling film, but the filmmaker also wants John Hughes style cuteness to leaven the harshness (and perhaps increase the box office). It doesn't work.Nadine lives in a world of teenage suburban privilege--great schools, stylish homes with pools, all the electronics a kid could want--,but lacks the one thing she desperately needs: a complete neuropsychiatric work-up.That no one around her sees the seriousness of her mental condition and gets her the professional help she desperately needs is the real story here. But that wouldn't allow for the John Hughes style ending.Personality disorders are no laughing matter and aren't solved by clever plot points."

",-0.1779,0.974,2018-03-02 00:00:00,7,"'The Edge Of Seventeen (2016)' is a fairly typical coming-of-age drama but avoids the usual or more typical beats the genre usually wades towards, instead focusing upon a more low-key or realistic approach to its rather small, insular series of events that mean little to the outside world but a great deal to the central character. It's a dry, somewhat sardonic but ultimately quite uplifting piece with a keen focus on its over-reacting protagonist and her slightly skewed but valid and understandable world view. The experience is an entertaining if pretty predictable one that is sometimes surprisingly moving and always enjoyable even during its most paint-by-numbers moments. 7/10"

We empathize with her and understand that she means well, but we cringe as she's incredibly insensitive to her teacher (Woody Harrelson) and a boy who likes her (Hayden Szeto). Kyra Sedgwick is good as the mother, dealing with her own pain and insecurities, and yet also unkind to her daughter. It's a strong cast, and a strong script as well - emotionally honest, and never cloying. Steinfeld's scenes with Szeto on the roller coaster and swimming pool are very well done, as are her scenes with Jenner late in the movie. Throughout it all, Harrelson dispensing tough love hits all the right notes. It's hard to do films in this genre because there has been so many over the years, but director Kelly Fremon Craig gives this one a sense of depth and substance."

Kyra Sedgwick (the mom) and Woody Harrelson (the teacher) totally compliment the great performances that Hailee Steinfeld presented, in my opinion the interaction between Nadine and her mom, and Nadine with her teacher was well done, presenting the issue that Nadine was going through as a teen. However, Krista (played by Haley Lu Richardson) was not even serious in her acting, I can't help but to see every interaction that she do was trying ""not to laugh or smile"" even when the scene is supposed to be a serious one. It was cringe-worthy to look at Haley Lu Richardson's acting skill in this movie, such a bad acting. Overall, Hailee Steinfeld, Kyra Sedgwick and Woody Harrelson saved the movie from being a total garbage. I rate this 5 because of these 3 great characters' performances."

Here the focus is honed in on a person with an outsider's sense of not belonging, and yet clearly painted as someone with a distinct and agile personality. Hailee Steinfeld lights up this movie and so do the whole cast. The writing is sharp and sensitive to the time, and also keeps the viewer engaged with the characters without letting any of them slip into afterthoughts."
" Run-of-the mill coming-of-age tale of teenage angst enhanced by strong lead and redemptive denouement
",0.5106,0.9872,2017-10-17 00:00:00,6,"Films that feature depressed characters with virtually no ego usually don't work. If you come across some of my past reviews, you'll see that I refer to such characters as ""sad sacks."" The focus is usually on the character's internal arc—and usually it's either a lack of insight or tragic flaw that the character's creator holds out as some sort of a great revelation. The one-dimensional Norma Desmond from Sunset Boulevard is one such example—a film (i.e. the one starring Gloria Swanson) has great atmosphere but the downward spiral of the faded screen star is wholly predictable as it plods along.Fortunately Kelly Fremon Craig's coming-of-age dramedy, The Edge of Seventeen, features a protagonist, Nadine Franklin (played winningly by Hailee Steinfeld) who doesn't fall completely into the pit of blatant ""sad-sackism"" due to a plot that offers a small measure of redemption at film's end.The question is whether do you want to sit for about an hour and a half and watch Nadine decompensate to the point of suicide? As a matter of fact, the film's ""inciting incident"" occurs when Nadine approaches her high school teacher, Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson), right during the opening scene, and proclaims that she intends to do herself in.We're then presented with Nadine's backstory, which chronicles her road to extreme depression. There's the death of her kindly father when she was 11 who acted as a buffer between her and her neurotic mother, Mona (overplayed a bit by Kyra Sedgwick). The loss of the father figure is obviously the underlying reason for her problems but the burgeoning romantic relationship between her best friend Krista and handsome, socially adept older brother, Darian, is what sends her into a tizzy in the present.Krista and Darian prove to be throwaway characters as they're simply designed to be Nadine's glorified support system. More interesting is Nadine's interactions with potential flames— the ""bad boy"" Nick and nerdy film student, Erwin Kim.Nadine impulsively sends a sexually explicit text to Nick and after going for a midnight drive and parking at a lover's lane, she realizes that she is not cut out for a one night stand. Erwin also puts the moves on Nadine in his family swimming pool, but unlike Nick (who could be potentially dangerous), Erwin proves to be a clumsy ""nice guy,"" easily dismissed by the confused Nadine.Only later, when Nadine attends the school film festival and sees how talented Erwin really is, she begins to re- examine her feelings toward a guy who she dismissed earlier as basically a goofball. It's really Nadine's turn-around, where she starts accepting herself and overcomes her crushing depression, that allows the film to be not so completely one-note.As for Mr. Bruner as Nadine's sarcastic teacher, the sarcasm is a bit of a twist but ultimately he's nothing more than another supportive adult who ends up giving Nadine a ride home and a few choice words of encouragement.Ultimately, the supporting players here don't have a lot to do, but Steinfeld (who impressed in her auspicious debut in True Grit) proves to be a real star in the making (she not only can act but sings as well, as evidenced by her performance in Pitch Perfect).There is nothing extraordinary about Edge of Seventeen but given the solid lead performance and the aforementioned ""redemptive"" climax, this is a film that probably rates a decent 6 out of 10."
" Doesn't hit as hard as it should
",0.0762,-0.9101,2017-10-12 00:00:00,7,"I know most people would have felt sympathy for Nadine. I personally wanted her to follow through with her suicide threats at times. I always struggle to connect with protagonists who hate themselves and actively try to make situations worse by saying the wrong thing. It comes from an attention seeking place and is inherently self absorbed. Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic playing her of course, I don't fault her performance for a second. She was just not much of a character to root for. From what we see Darrian really only insults her after she insults him first, and for the most part just wants to live his life, he isn't a complete alpha male asshole who thrives on power, just a kid who happened to be born good looking and thus got what most of us want, popularity. The movie is good, but not great. It is not as powerful and memorable as recent teen dramas that came out in recent years. It also has clichéd silly music and sitcom moments where it really should have picked a tone and stuck with it. Also Krista's character is woefully underdeveloped. Would have been nice to see a few more scenes where they confide in each other about Nadine's behaviour. Woody Harrelson elevates this from a 6 to a 7 by just being Woody Harrelson. The man turns orange juice to whisky. This movie simply could have left more of an imprint than it does."
" The Teenage Battle Field
",-0.3818,0.9581,2017-10-11 00:00:00,8,"At first I thought ""The Edge of Seventeen"" would grate on my every nerve. The jokey tone felt forced, and I didn't know if I could stand two hours of Hailee Steinfeld's character, an unlikable girl who thinks she's funnier and cuter than she is. But if you're feeling this way yourself, stick with it, because the film expands into a much richer and much less glib examination of adolescence than it appears that it's going to be at the outset.Steinfeld gives a wonderful performance, and pulls off a tricky role. Characters like this are always a gamble for actors. They have to be played just right or we just end up disliking them. Steinfeld manages to make us exasperated with her even while we understand that her unlikability is her armor and the thing that stands between her deep insecurity and the fear that she is going to be rejected. Better to be the one who rejects and therefore the one in control of any given situation. One thing I liked most about this film is the complexity it brings to every character. We see them first as one- note caricatures because that's how Steinfeld's character sees them, but over the course of the film she and we realize that they have much more complicated inner lives that she was missing because of her self absorption.The ending of this film is a bit too pat and neat, and once again suggests to unwary moviegoers that people with emotional challenges can just be better if they decide they want to be. But overall I very much liked this study of what it's like to be a teenager these days, even if it doesn't remotely resemble my own teenage years.Grade: A-"

",0.0,-0.3046,2017-10-01 00:00:00,6,"Dysfunctional is certainly the word here as Haile Steinfeld is becoming of age. Problem is that the film lacks true grit in every sense of the word.Rebellious and sad from an early age, her mother is equally off the wall as played by Kyra Sedgwick. Matters get complicated when her fun loving dad collapses and dies while driving his car with his daughter next to him.Woody Harrelson plays an off-beat history teacher who in reality really gives a bad name to the teaching profession. He becomes Nadine's counselor, especially when she tells him of her plan to commit suicide and he responds that he is planning to do himself in as well.The story goes on in an unending set of circumstances, Sedgwick's widow lady having an affair with her dentist, Nadine's older brother falling for her only friend that really sets her off. Is this sibling rivalry, jealousy or just a mixed up girl taking out her frustrations with life?The odd-ball ending where the brother tells off the sister and saying that she has been right all the time leads to a presto normal girl.

" A Good Actress
",0.4404,0.8748,2017-09-30 00:00:00,7,"Hailee Steinfeld was very good in this. I liked how dorky and awkward she was. This was a movie about a teen first and foremost, rather than a ""teen movie,"" reminded me of the movie 'Sixteen Candles'. Just wanted more interaction between her and Woody Harrelson. A well done smart funny movie that will appeal not just to the teenage crowd."
" Clichéd teen movie tackles borderline personality disorder
",-0.4019,-0.9927,2017-09-19 00:00:00,6,"In The Edge of Seventeen (2016), 17-year-old Nadine Byrd (Hailee Steinfeld) navigates the awkwardness of becoming an adult in her junior year of high school after her father dies of a heart attack. She reaches a crisis point when her only friend, Krista (Haley Lu Richardson), hooks up with and begins dating her older brother, Darian (Blake Jenner). Her relationship with her mother, Mona (Kyra Sedgwick), further deteriorates as Nadine vents her frustration on friends, family, and her history teacher, Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson). The cloud has a silver lining when she meets a similarly awkward young man, Erwin (Hayden Szeto).The film has some bright spots, and some genuinely funny or touching moments, but mostly it is just the same clichéd teen movie we've seen a hundred times before. Not Another Teen Movie already satirized this film in 2001. It may have a deeper meaning, however, if what I perceived as a genuine portrayal of mental illness turns out to be accurate.Critics loved this movie, and for the life of me I can't figure out why. Molly Eichel at the Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, ""The Edge of Seventeen is funny and tragic, but most of all it feels real in the same way John Hughes movies felt real. It's not a candy-coated version of teenagedom. It's harsh, and awkward, and funny, just like being a teenager."" Other critics called it ""straight and sincere,"" ""smart and perceptive,"" and ""there isn't a moment in this movie that doesn't feel completely true."" Who paid them to write this nonsense? Numerous critics have laughably compared this film to John Hughes' 1980s teen comedies. If only it was half as authentic. The Edge of Seventeen exists in an imaginary world where everyone owns a backyard pool, no one is overweight, and even the nerds have washboard abs. I actually rolled my eyes when geeky, stuttering Erwin takes off his shirt to get into the pool, revealing a toned, athletic figure. Nadine Byrd is another shy, awkward character played by a runway model who becomes beautiful and well dressed after spending a quick montage at the bathroom mirror.As I was watching The Edge of Seventeen, I realized that something was going on beyond just the typical ""awkward self-loathing teen."" Although the film is purportedly about a young woman dealing with typical teenage angst, most of the teenagers in the movie actually seem happy and well-adjusted. It's subtle enough not to catch, but if you pay attention, you will realize that Nadine Byrd and her mother are seriously mentally ill. Nadine's mother is hysterical, controlling, promiscuous, and dependent on her teenage son for stability. At one point, she turns to her daughter and explains that she only pretends to be happy, when she really feels empty inside.Nadine acts very much like her mother. She has unstable relationships with other people, an unstable sense of self, and unstable emotions (acting out in fits of anger). She has an extreme fear of abandonment (revealed in her overreaction to her brother and best friend's relationship), dangerous behavior (telling a boy she just met she wants to sleep with him, then allowing him to drive her to a remote parking lot where she suddenly changes her mind), a feeling of emptiness, and self-harm (binge drinking, threatening suicide). These are all symptoms of borderline personality disorder. BPD can be inherited, or triggered by a traumatic event (death of a close loved one, for example).If true, The Edge of Seventeen has a terrible message for viewers, which is that Nadine will simply ""grow up"" someday and stop feeling this way. Yes, everyone does grow out of typical teenage awkwardness and identity crisis, but a serious mental illness like BPD requires regular medical attention. I've known people who suffered from this disorder, and it has a lasting, devastating effect on personal and romantic relationships. If left untreated, Nadine's disorder will likely follow her to college, where she will engage in riskier behavior, substance abuse, and continue to have feelings of abandonment and self loathing.Woody Harrelson's character, Mr. Bruner, is a bright spot in the film. He plays the part of an aging, sarcastic teacher well. I wish the rest of the film's dialog was as witty, subtle, and surprising as his exchanges with Nadine. Unfortunately, The Edge of Seventeen is one awkward scene after another loosely strung together by a boilerplate plot, resolved neatly at the end because ""love conquers all."" Much to my disappointment, it's not as witty, genuine, and endearing as critics claim."

Well i wasn't really expecting too much at the beginning and i thought it's gonna be kinda boring but it WASN'! It was a very heartwarming movie.. I could relate with almost all her problems.. those stuff about hating the way i look or i speak, i struggled with that for a really long time and seeing her get over her problems..well.. being a ""teen"" isn't all that fun at all and this movie proves it. And most of all I laughed too hard! Can't remember the last time a movie made me laugh this much. I would definitely watch this movie again. I really recommend this movie, you'll have a good time watching it."
" Accurate and funny representation of life as a teen
",0.4404,0.9619,2017-09-07 00:00:00,7,"'The Edge of Seventeen' is a realistic and highly enjoyable comedy/drama about a girl and her struggles growing up. Unlike the conventional comedy film, it seeks to do more than simply make you laugh. The drama is very much at the forefront of the film, with main character Nadine attracting a lot more than just laughs from the viewer.This is very much Hailee Steinfeld's film, she carries the whole thing from start to finish with another exceptional performance as Nadine. Even small details such as her mannerisms were so accurate and true of a typical teenager. The rest of the characters are also relatable, even for older viewers. 'The Edge of Seventeen' is more than just a teen comedy, it's also a very accurate portrayal of teenage life."

We all know that's not exactly the case, sure many of us so called ""adults"" wouldn't back away from an opportunity to be relatively care free and 17 again, but entering into the often harsh world of adulthood, as the grown up world creeps up ever so surely on us isn't entirely the smooth sailing ride we all wish it was.Well documented in countless teen movies over the years, from full blown comedy too far more serious in tone events, covering that awkward age between teenage life and impending adulthood isn't a new thing to do in movies by any means but debut director Kelly Fremon Craig's likable and believable coming of age dramedy The Edge of Seventeen brings enough heart and soul to the table with sprinklings of nice originality, that this easy to digest event is easily one of the better pictures on the topic in recent times.Spearheaded by another impressive turn from Hailee Steinfeld (in arguably her best role since her breakout in the True Grit remake), Edge see's Steinfeld's complicated and in many ways hard done by Nadine try and keep her head above water as her best friend dates her brother and various other trials threaten to get the best of her and with clever writing from Craig and a feeling of genuine heart and some very observant wit, Edge is a step above others in its class.There are some heavy issues spoken about and dealt with within the film, enough that it may even make viewing uncomfortable for some but Craig should be commended for not shirking away from these hot topic issues like depression/technology and with Steinfeld on good form and the likes of Woody Harrelson (playing extremely tolerant teacher Mr. Bruner) and Kyra Sedgewick as Nadine's single mother Mona only help but bring the film's tough moments home.Where Edge falls down curiously is within Nadine the character.A tough one to get on board with, Nadine's needy and often irrational behaviour isn't always endearing (perhaps that's the point?) and had Nadine been a more consistently tolerable core to the film, its highly likely that this slice of teenage life could've easily entered into the classics of the genre and while not game breaking, Nadine's whining and bad manners don't come across as earnt most of the time.Final Say – The Edge of Seventeen is a film that all of us could relate to in some way or another and this darkly funny and occasionally touching film that includes some noteworthy performances and a winning script is worth seeking out, even if Nadine herself isn't exactly someone we'd want to spend too much more time with.This is a highly polished debut film from Kelly Fremon Craig that marks her down as a talent to keep a very close eye on.3 ½ cookies out of 5"

And I can only come to the conclusion that those ose kind of movies are just not for me. I can get that teenagers like those kind of movies, because maybe they can recognize some stuff from their own adolescent life. But for a grown childless man like myself the last thing I want to see is whining adolescents during ninety minutes. Because that's what you basically get with The Edge Of Seventeen. Hailee Steinfeld plays Nadine, a teenager that complains about almost everything while in my humble opinion she has absolutely no reason to. The movie is shot nicely though, the acting is just okay, the script is boring. Boring for almost everybody past twenty-five."

I just thought it was another coming-of-age film like all the others, with no particular difference ... Ups.The Edge of Seventeen is fantastic! It isn't a conventional coming- of-age movie, it has so much more to it. Starting on the rating, I love the fact that this is rated R. There's never a single scene where someone tells a teenager ""oh, you can't say that"". All of the youngsters in this film talk like high-schoolers, they say ""shit"" and ""fuck"" like they say in real life because that's actually realistic. Kelly Fremon Craig does a great job not manipulating what is real, she just shows how it is in our world nowadays with no strings attached.Hailee Steinfeld ... Wow. I never thought of her as a real contender for big parts in big movies, but after this one, she definitely saved herself a spot on the top. She's so real, she says everything that once went through our minds during this time and she perfectly captures all of it: sadness, depression, suicidal mind ... happiness, pride, sense of relief ... She carries the whole film and I wouldn't be too surprise to see an Oscar or a Golden Globe nomination.The rest of the cast is also great. Everyone from Haley Lu Richardson (Krista), who plays her best friend, to her teacher, Woody Harrelson (Mr. Bruner). The humor involved between the characters is super funny, the writing is on point for each of them and the story is also really good.I guess my only complaints are the slightly rushed ending and some personality details about Nadine that should've been better explained instead of just being left out there (like her being ""an old soul"" and not having anything in common with students around her age).Either way, The Edge of Seventeen is one of the greatest surprises of 2016 and one of the best coming-of-age movies in a long, long time. Hailee Steinfeld is pitch-perfect on his role as Nadine, the writing is great, the story is good and the humor is super funny throughout the whole film. Some minor issues bring down the movie a little, but it is still an amazing time at the theater.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" Steinfeld's a treasure
",0.296,-0.6114,2017-08-05 00:00:00,8,"From what I've seen, ""Edge of Seventeen"" is marketed as a teen movie, but there's irony to that. There are the usual genre tropes, but it's also laced with startling pain. The humorous highs are matched by one wince after another, personified by Hailee Steinfeld (who makes bad temperament an art form). Her part is so well cast that the adolescent suffering of Nadine is palpable. I can identify with some of her woes. Woody Harrelson is the other integral piece, the comic wit to balance her angst. His scenes are among the best and he's ideal as the weary history teacher saddled with high school drama.Even when the movie takes a midpoint swerve into abject bitterness, it's concern for Nadine's story that kept me glued. There is a light at the end of this tunnel and it's really a catharsis. You want her to get through this. It's a tremendously affecting movie.8/10"

It is sort of like watching ""Harper valley PTA"" and discovering it was a different Harper Valley PTA where nothing went on.Hailee Steinfeld has inherited the moody maladjusted teen role from Ellen Page, who could probably still pull it off, we just wouldn't believe it. We see Nadine ""suffer"" through all sorts of teen angst and faux drama, like her best friend (Haley Lu Richardson) is dating her hunk brother (Blake Jenner). I am not sure what the issue is there, but whatever it was, it was big. She does not confide in her mother (Kyra Sedgwick) and growing up, she was a daddy's girl until he passed. Her loan confidant is her history teacher (Woody Harrelson) who has his own way which adds to the humor of the film. Nadine is crushing on Nick (Alexander Calvert) while Erwin (Hayden Szeto) crushes on her...more like ""Love Stinks"" than ""Edge of Seventeen.""

" A Delightful Watch With A Mesmerizing Hailee Steinfeld!
",0.6239,0.9982,2017-07-13 00:00:00,9,"God Bless Your Soul John Hughes. Your imprint in Cinema remains alive even years after your passing. And 'The Edge of Seventeen' is literally a John Hughes coming-of-age film, without his name on it, but of a fan, a very talented storyteller named Kelly Fremon Craig, who brings us a film for the ages. And how great is Hailee Steinfeld here? 'The Edge of Seventeen' Synopsis: High-school life gets even more unbearable for Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) when her best friend, Krista, starts dating her older brother. 'The Edge of Seventeen' is about growing up, despite life hitting you hard. I was 17 once, I was anxious, excited & confused, all at the time same. The film's protagonist, Nadine, is exactly how we've all been in our late teens. Kelly has written her protagonist with gusto. Right from giving her immense tragedy as an early teen, to her unknowing selfishness that almost leads her to lose her best friend (only friend), is Written with genuineness. I was engrossed by Nadine's complicated mind & I was waiting to see what she does next. Her journey is a delightful mix of ambiguity & immense pain. Kelly's Writing is strong, keeping us engaged in her Portagonist's journey!Kelly's Direction is simplistic, but perfect. Kelly is a Storyteller to watch out for! Her work here as a Writer & Director, deserves immense praise. Cinematography & Editing are well-done.And now coming to its Ace - Hailee Steinfeld. Steinfeld is mesmerizing as Nadine. The Oscar-Nominated performer blasts up the big-screen with a knockout performance. She emotes each & every emotion, with genuine feeling. Its impossible not to love Nadine, despite her flaws. This is career-high performance, that was overlooked, unfortunately! Steinfeld is perfection! Of the supporting cast, the always-reliable Woody Harrelson scores as Nadine's teacher, who in many ways turns out to be her only mentor. Haley Lu Richardson as Nadine's best friend, is first-rate. Blake Jenner as Nadine's older brother, is natural to the core. Hayden Szeto as Nadine's secret admirer, is fantastic. And Kyra Sedgwick as Nadine's mother, is just right. On the whole, 'The Edge of Seventeen' is an experience you simply can't afford to miss. Say YES To Great Cinema. ALWAYS."

Nadine's quirky personality can be off putting but she is relatable. Even with the teen angst the film is hopeful, humorous,personal and full of heart. It is a rare, touching, yet liberating look at growing up and the much too real landmines one has to navigate to enter adulthood. Solid performances by Harrelson, Sedgwick and Blake Jenner. A new teen classic! Best indie I've seen in Ages!"

Her life is one of miserable sarcasm except for her best friend since second grade, Krista (Haley Lu Richardson). She hates her perfect brother Darian (Blake Jenner). Dorky Erwin Kim has a crush on her but she's in lust with delinquent Nick Mossman. To her horrors, Krista starts dating Darian. The only person she could turn to is equally sarcastic teacher Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson).It's funny. It's touching. It's poignant. There are no superficial characters in the main group. The jokes are great. Everybody's great. Woody is a real standout. The only drawback I can remotely dig up is that Hailee Steinfeld is too pretty. She follows a long line of Hollywood beauties who dress down to do 'She's All That'. The Pedro joke is hilarious which helps a lot. However, she's never going to be Danny DeVito level. The reason it works so well is a terrific performance from Hailee. She really sells this self-obsessed bitter teen while maintaining a great likability. One roots for her and sees the world from her eyes even as everyone knows that she's wrong. Hailee shows some terrific acting talents once again."

It's a dream debut for the director. Being a woman and making a film on the same subject, especially teenager issue, really well investigated and turned into the beautiful film. Yeah, it is now one of the cult films and by the years pass on, it will gain more popularity with a certain group of people.A teen girl who lost her close friend to her brother after they both falling in love which she did not approve. It's only the beginning of her worst life in her mid teenage. So now she has to find a way to turn her life around, or she can live her life as it is, but with complaints. The second half of the film is to cover her attempt to recovery, if she achieves one.The surprise was, I anticipated normal teen comedy that targeted teens only. But it is almost for all ages, excluding the little ones for its strong thematic contents. Kind of inspiring and entertaining film. The casting was awesome. Hailee nailed it just like Ellen Page did for 'Juno'. Yeah, the people were comparing it with that film already. Very satisfying film on this particular theme and definitely a must see.8.5/10"
" The Edge of Seventeen is annoying
",-0.4019,0.7269,2017-05-17 00:00:00,5,"So I just finished watching The Edge of Seventeen and I was annoyed from the beginning. Hailee Steinfeld character Nadine is an annoying bratty 17 year old girl who seems to think she is the only one with problems.The truth is she is very selfish and expects everyone to agree with her on everything. She makes bad decisions, gives an ultimatum to her one and only friend, treats her family like dog poop and then expects everyone to feel sorry for her.I will say that Hailee Steinfeld is a great actress because I truly believed that her character was this bratty girl. Woody Harrelson is great and I was really hoping that the character Nadine would have some sort of redeeming qualities but I just didn't feel it."

I don't remember if I have read it somewhere or my mind just made it up after watching this film; but that's what I felt after watching it. The plot is nothing much complex. The film is about a girl, Nadine, who had difficulty to connect with anyone and was jealous of her brother who was always confident and better at communicating with most of the people. So, she used to be alone. When she finds a friend- Kyra- a loner like her, with whom she easily connected; they shared the most awkward things with one another. But things change when they grow up. That friend starts dating her elder brother and it becomes even more unbearable for her. What I loved the most about this film is, it didn't try to justify how some character was morally right or wrong; when there were so many chances to do so. Just for creating sympathy, Nadine was not shown as the sanest person or other characters like her friend or brother unjust. She was still the stubborn, vulnerable teenager. She was not insane. She was just what she was. Woody Harrelson was flawless for sure. Even after seeing only little of his work before, I was quite impressed. But, Hailee was something else! She was totally in the character's skin. This film made me instant fan of her. She said every dialogue as it was meant for her. But it was the moments in between where she really shows her shine. Whether it was the scene where she was left alone when Kyra went to talk with others or while she was at her teacher's house, looking at other side of his personality; she nailed it! As I said, this was so relatable to introverts. Maybe that's why I liked it more than I needed to!"

Add in a sublime performance from Woody Harrelson and you really have a movie worth seeing.I went into see this with no real knowledge of what it was about, but being a big Woody Harrelson and Kyra Sedgwick fan, for me it was a no-brainer must see.While this type of teenage coming of age movie has been around for a long time now, this one still entertains and holds some originality without becoming too cliché.If for nothing else, this really is worth seeing just for the performances of Heilee Steinfeld and Woody Harrelson.7.5/10, but rounded up to an 8 as IMDb does not allow half points."

",0.4404,0.9914,2017-05-05 00:00:00,8,"Reminiscent of John Hughes movies, but with its own new angles, character, and wit, director and writer Kelly Fremon Craig's ""Edge of Seventeen"" ought to be called one of the better teenage drama and comedies in several years. I thoroughly enjoyed the cast and lead Steinfeld in this bittersweet ""dramedy"" of a woman coming of age enduring odds of sibling rivalry and parental controls, things that most if not many can identify with. The movie pays a short homage to ""Napolean Dynamite"", a little less serious but equally good movie that predates it by over 10 years. Craig digs deeply into female angles on friendship, sex, and belonging while Hailee Steinfeld gives an equally good mix of emotion and sarcasm thanks in no small part to Craig's material. Woody Harrelson has a smaller but fun grounding-rod part that he looks to be enjoying. Very Good and Recommended 8/10"

" Paints one of the most honest portraits of coming-of-age while honoring the tradition of such films
",0.7841,0.9947,2017-05-03 00:00:00,9,"Coming-of-age indies are a dime a dozen, but something is different about Kelly Fremon Craig's ""The Edge of Seventeen."" It might even be so simple as her perspective as a woman. Honestly. There's not enough of that making it to the big screen. On a less binary note, however, there's also something profoundly more real about it too.""Seventeen"" stars Hailee Steinfeld as Nadine, your average privileged white high school student who feels the world doesn't understand her. Role your eyes at her if you will, but Nadine also lost her father when she was 13 and has never been able to connect with her mother (Kyra Sedgwick), or her brother, Darian (Blake Jenner). So when her best friend, Krista (Haley Lu Richardson), the only other person she's close with, hooks up with Darian, she begins to feel her world is falling apart.The story is a roller-coaster/push-and-pull between empathizing with Nadine and her tough situation and having no pity for her whatsoever when she takes certain actions. No, on paper that doesn't sound like the most fun protagonist to watch, but it means that Craig has created a character that is unmistakably human. And Nadine isn't the only character who gets this balanced treatment in the script. All the main players are cast in both shadow and light, challenging our brains' desire to sort characters into good and bad boxes and project our own moral framework onto everything we see. That's just not the case with most movies about young people discovering who they are. We normally can sort the bad influences from the good. Life, however, is shades of gray, and rarely do we see that so clearly in a movie about rich or upper-middle class teens and their families.Part of this balance is epitomized in the relationship between Nadine and her teacher Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson at his comedic best). Nadine comes to Bruner when she's looking for pity, wisdom or a sounding board, and Bruner takes her the exact opposite of seriously. Somehow, they both know that someone telling her she's ridiculous is precisely what she needs, which is why she keeps turning to him. Their relationship is both the safest one in Nadine's life and the one that pushes her the most. As a perk for us, their repartee is on point.Steinfeld shows that earning an Oscar nod for her first ever big- screen role (The Coen Brothers' ""True Grit"") will not likely be a fluke with this performance that juggles comedy with deep, sincere emotion. She makes Nadine a classic teenager having classic teenager reactions; Nadine puts on a boisterous, humorous front, but almost as quickly as she can crack an insult, Steinfeld can reach down for raw moments of personal discovery. It's as easy to see yourself in Nadine as it is to be annoyed by her attitudes and behaviors.Truthfully, those of us who are no longer teenagers, or no longer the parents of teenagers, have the benefit of hindsight when watching this movie. Craig in ways forces us to relive these moments not with a nostalgic fondness, but with all-too-familiar pangs of reality.That's well and good if you have experienced those things, but it would be interesting to get the take of a current teenager on this movie. At one point, Nadine bemoans her generation's attachment to their phones and declares herself an ""old soul,"" but it's hard to say whether that's true or just the byproduct of Craig's own limitations telling the story of a young woman coming of age in a world that looks much different than the one she came of age in. All this to say, the film doesn't suffer for this, but it might not speak the truth of the young adults it depicts so much as the truth of audiences watching this film and recalling their long-passed youth. Named after a song like any film with an ""old soul"" that's aware of the homage it owes to John Hughes, ""The Edge of Seventeen"" both recognizes the mold that it's made from but challenges it in appropriate ways. Craig doesn't try to subvert the ""formula"" with an unhappy ending or something else unexpected, but she makes appropriate tweaks to these genre conventions. No grand romantic gestures, no emotion-filled moments of reconciliation – just characters having experiences and growing from them.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"

Also, Hailee Steinfeld is a good actress so I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, this movie didn't live up to my expectations. The girl, Nadine, is supposed to be smart, isn't she? However, some of the things she did are very stupid, at least to me. Of course teenagers do stupid things all the time but the writers should decide if she's an ordinary girl who does dumb things or a smart girl who knows what she's doing. The teacher had some cool moments but what was the meaning of his appearance? Him and Nadine had some cool lines in the trailer which made me interested but in the movie they're such a bore. At the end, I didn't feel anything. I didn't know what I was supposed to feel. The character development was unimpressive and lame. The story was lame too. I gave this a 6 because despite the movie was bad in its own, I still enjoyed watching it (idk why either) and because I like Hailee. Her acting was very natural."

The not so good. I thought her acting was poor. I looked at many other reviews, (most of the bad ones) and nobody mentioned her acting. I am no expert, but it just seemed to me that at various times she was TRYING to act. almost as if she was playing a parody of herself. That is fine if the movie is supposed to be a parody. I thought the same thing could be said about Teresa Palmer in'the Choice'. but if you are good looking, and/or in the case of Steinfelds case have a movie under your belt (True Grit), you can get away with anything, and more so when people expect you to be good, they see only the good. the movie also did a poor job of really zoning in on the true issues that face most teenagers. the potential was there for a good movie, but it really was not brought home."

It's frustrating because it's so, so close to capturing the feeling of being a seventeen year-old-girl in one moment, then wildly misses the mark in the next. No reasonable seventeen-year-old girl abandons her decade-long best friend for a guy without some other falling-out first, and most of us had to save ourselves (or our friends) from our own escapades rather than having our clueless brothers do it for us. Really confused by this movie because at first it feels like they're trying to give an honest picture of female adolescence, but then they censored anything that might have felt too real. What's the point? I found it so much more disappointing than a movie that didn't even try, because they clearly could have done it but chose not to."

",-0.4588,0.9958,2017-03-30 00:00:00,9,"In the category of a teen, this is the best I ever saw. Mixed the comedy parts with very strong, dramatic parts. I think it makes the movie more than other teen movies, but at the same time is a coming age story too. Hailee Steinfeld is wonderful in this film. We find the the usually teen movie elements like: mother-daughter conflict and drama, best friend(here the movie give you more the average teen movie, this is one of the best parts of the movie), an annoying brother, trouble in school( nobody likes you), a guy who the girl like, but not the right one and the guy who the girl like, but not that way, like the guy, and the end she finds out he is the right one. We must say something about the characters, in this movie I find the most too irritating character I ever see in a teen movie: The brother, Darian. He is the worst brother, whom you wish yourself. He is selfish, self- conceited, and the best he sleeps you best friend and after they ask what is your problem with that??? He thinks why should bother you I ruin your relationship with your best friend, I didn't - he said. You did. I just slept with her and after that, I start date with her. I can't understand you. Best friend, Krista. She is a betrayer. She won't think she ruins, his relationship with Nadin. She asked why don't you happy when I am happy because I find a boyfriend myself? Aw, your brother is, but doesn't matter. After that she won't understand why Nadin said: I never want to see you again!!! I think this too characters forgot the number one rule, about relationships: Never dating your best friend brother/sister or never date your sister/brother best friend. Or this is my own number one rule??? And everybody okay with that???? Of course, you can do if want to ruin one of or both relations or if you have a strong and broadminded relationship with both. The mother, she is selfish too, she thinks she has one and only perfect child, not a very strong person. The movie is good, but you see above has some very annoying character. You definitely watch the movie, probably you won't find this to characters annoying. A scene that doesn't work in the film: After Nadin and Darian fight, and Nadin go home and apologies to Darian, and the hug each other, this scene just doesn't work. Nothing truthfulness in here. The brother starts, but this scene seems very fake. I thought when I am seeing the makers just put here because we want to solve the brother-sister conflict problem because the genre and the positive ending is necessitating, but I think it is pointless. Reason one: the qualities of the characters won't allow us a scene like that. Reason two: the whole scene seems fake because of the reason one."

She was thoroughly unlikable. Also, the improbable casting of Hailee Steinfeld as someone who would be unpopular in high-school with her gorgeous face and super-model body and quirky fashion-sense, was eye-rolling. The writing was excellent as there was not one one-dimensional character in the cast. No one was all bad or all good. This movie turns the typical John Hughes- type cast of characters on their ear: the nerdy Asian with a crush on Nadine, the former friend who abandons her for the popular clique, the dumb jock brother, the neurotic mother, the trusted, unconventional but wise teacher, the handsome entitled and popular unrequited love interest. they are all here...but not here. They are different. Even our lovable but awkward heroine who finally finds her way. Like I said, she is not all that lovable. Hmmmm. I take back what I said about this being a downside.

" Beautifully Written and Fantastically Acted
",0.5719,0.983,2017-03-22 00:00:00,9,"The Edge of Seventeen follows a young girl in high school who, after learning of her best friend's and brother's romantic relationship, begins to distance herself from other people and ultimately ends up diving into something of a depression. The writing here is fantastic. I don't think I've ever seen a teen 'comedy' as relatable and real as this one. The characters talk and act like teenagers, and despite being a male, I was able to relate to most every problem Nadine (the main character) faced to an extent. And the other characters are interesting and, again, relatable. The movie progresses in a way that typically proves to be unpredictable simply because we don't get a lot of movies that capture teen-hood this well, so while I expected some conventional- ism, I got little to none of it. The acting is all great. While everyone gives a good performance, Hailee Steinfeld stands above each one. She gives a performance that topples her first Oscar nomination in 'True Grit' without a doubt, yet somehow she got snubbed. Regardless, I think we can all appreciate just how good her performance here was. The comedy is really well integrated into the movie. I used the word 'comedy' in quotations earlier because I wouldn't necessarily call it that. It's a teenage drama that has circumstantial comedy in it. It doesn't go out of it's way to make the audience laugh, yet it still manages to capture the hilarity of being a teenager from time to time, and for those who can relate they prove to be very funny parts. I don't usually complement a movie for it's pacing because the expectation is that a movie is well-paced. If it's boring, usually that means it failed. If it isn't, well good job movie you met my expectations. And yet, this movie is completely enthralling from beginning to end. Not once was I bored by it, nor did I ever really care to check the remaining run time. In fact, I wished the movie would just keep going on forever by the time it ended. If I have but one problem with this movie, it's the way it started. Something about it was just a little shaky. Looking back now I'm not entirely sure why, but it seemed a little off, and I wasn't exactly sure what to think of it.Overall The Edge of Seventeen is fantastic. The writing, characters, music, pacing, and acting are all just that. And on top of it all, it proves to be very emotionally effective. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie."
" Authentic, But Not Necessarily Always Entertaining
",-0.4782,0.9918,2017-03-18 00:00:00,5,"Much of the positive buzz about ""The Edge of Seventeen"" came from positive comparisons to films like ""The Breakfast Club"" or ""16 Candles"". As I'm always up for movies that describe the emotional state of the teen years (provided they aren't gross-out/sex comedies...I don't care for those all that much), and am a big fan of Hailee Steinfeld, I decided to give this one a try. What I found is that while the film is most certainly authentic (i.e. seems to be true to what teens go through these days), I can't say it was really all that entertaining either. It just lacked that emotional investment towards the characters that one needs to truly fall in love with a film.For a basic plot summary, ""Edge of Seventeen"" tells the story of Nadine (Steinfeld), a teen girl who doesn't fit in with anyone in her school. The only way she wards off utter depression is that best friend Krista (Haley Lu Richardson) always has her back and teacher Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson) proves to be a great sounding board for her problems. Things don't get much better at home, as Krista resents her super-popular brother Darian (Blake Jenner) and mother Mona (Kyra Sedgwick) struggles to function after the death of her husband. A chain of complicated events/emotions is put into play when Krista and Darian become a pair, prompting Nadine to really examine many different aspects of her life.First and foremost when evaluating ""Edge of Seventeen"" is the fact that this movie is completely and utterly carried by Steinfeld. She is a true acting talent (and has proved as much in previous films like ""True Grit"" and ""Pitch Perfect 2"") and dare I say without her presence this film may have been a complete dog. Even when the beats seem predictable or the acting isn't up to the highest standards, Steinfeld can carry both the light-hearted and emotional scenes. The only times I was emotionally invested in this film whatsoever were when she was front and center.Unfortunately, there are just too many other problems that plague this movie to really give it anything higher than a middling rating. For example...-Richardson's Krista looks like she is going to be a great character...but then is basically abandoned about halfway through the film.-Blake Jenner is cast perfect for his role in terms of physical appearance and stature, but I felt that perhaps his acting chops weren't what was needed for the part. I won't go so far as to call him a ""poor actor"", but a big part of family dynamics on the film center on him, and I was wholly underwhelmed when that was the case.-After the first 30-40 minutes (in which I was quite engaged), the rest of the way felt rather predictable and uninspiring. In other words, the setup was far, far better than the resolution.I realize that it is perhaps difficult for me (as an over-30 male) to fully identify with this movie, but I wasn't a teen in the 80s either and I still love ""Breakfast Club"". What that movie had that this one lacked was a such of dramatic flair, not being afraid to really break down what was going on in the minds of the characters. I feel like in ""Edge of Seventeen"", the focus was more on ""authenticity"" (making sure the look/feel of things seemed right) than ""dramatic entertainment"".So, while I think that the target audience (teens) will like this one more than I, I also don't think this will stand the test of time as a ""standout teen flick"", either. If you value authenticity and love to be totally immersed in the daily life of an era, this one may peak your interest, but in terms of really high drama it might fall a bit flat."
" One of the best coming-of-age film ever made.
",0.6369,0.977,2017-03-13 00:00:00,9,"One of the best coming-of-age film ever made. The Edge Of Seventeen is just the typical coping-up-with-teenage-problems story, however, it is the movie's wit and edgy humor partnered by Nadine's rough, spoiled-brat, stubbornly and a total out-of-control attitude that brings life to its piece.This, I consider is one of Steinfeld's best performances as an actress, with her natural charm and skills she, indeed, deliver her role amazingly, where it seems that Nadine is Hailee and Hailee is Nadine. I like her scenes where she's being stubborn with her mom (Kyra Sedgwick) and older brother (Blake Jenner), its looks natural, no joke, seems like Hailee is born to be a rebel kid.Not just Steinfeld, but also Hayden Szeto's, and their awkward friend-to-lovers story. Erwin's (Szeto) sheepish and nerdy attitude blends well with a hard-headed girl like Nadine.This is Kelly Fremon Craig's directoral debut and she already made a marvelous job in this likable teenage-comedy-drama, where only a few can actually interpret a teenage angst on-screen, some of them are just focusing on building up a love story between their characters, whereas, Edge Of Seventeen created a wall so they can stick with their agenda, to relay the events that's happening to teenagers, in a way that parents would understand.The Edge Of Seventeen tells about a girl, named Nadine, whose at a very young age is a total mulish up until she reached her teenage years. Then one night made the worst ever worse, she saw her older brother hooking up with her bestfriend, Krista (Haley Lu Richardson), which ruined their year-long friendship. Despite not having much of friends she's still her teacher's, Mr. Bruner (Woody Harrelson), favorite student, who, also served as her personal adviser. And then there's her crush, Nick (Alexander Calvert), that high-school badass prick, supposedly her only chance of getting happy, but only took advantage of Nadine, ending up brokenhearted and, as usual, disappointed."

I may not even have bothered with it at all if my curiosity wasn't drawn by some of the reviews saying how the central performance elevates it above most teen movies. They were not wrong - I was absolutely blown away by Hailee Steinfeld's confidence, charm and nuance in this role. She brings such life to it! I laughed, I cried, I recognised my teenage self in it; this is a really strong turn by someone so young and now I'm really excited to see what path she takes in the coming years. Very, very impressed.The script here isn't bad either, by the way. Very honest and unafraid, also funny. Woody Harellson plays a decent supporting role too as the teacher. Not a life changing film, but check it out for those reasons."
" Hailee Steinfeld is charming and funny in this appealing, if ordinary coming-of-age comedy
",0.8481,0.9982,2017-03-06 00:00:00,7,"The Edge of Seventeen often feels like a late refurbishment of the John Hughes teen flicks from the 80s. Hughes who directed classics such as 'The Breakfast Club', 'Sixteen Candles', and 'Pretty in Pink' became a staple of coming-of-age movies during the decade, and his works inspired many comedic tropes that still lie on many teen films today. This film directed by Kelly Fremon Craig in her directorial debut carries a few of those tropes, but rarely brings anything new to the table when portraying the anxiety and social pressure of high school teens. Nonetheless, the film delivers roughly an accurate depiction of how high school can some of the most awkward and embarrassing four years of your life regardless of if you were in the popular crowd or not. Did you ever feel like an outsider? Did you ever face unspeakable embarrassment when trying to get around the social pressures that littered your proposed high school experience? This movie greatly capitalizes on these concepts. This film follows 17-year old Nadine (played by Hailee Steinfeld), an irritable highschooler who's life is falling apart beginning with her best friend Krista (played by Haley Ru Richardson) sleeping with her older brother Darian (played by Blake Jenner). With no one to talk to but her eccentric teacher Mr. Bruner (played by Woody Harrelson), she eventually forms a friendship with her Asian classmate Erwin (played by Hayden Szeto) who becomes her sign of hope.If you are looking for a teen comedy that greatly benefits from laughs and charm, this one hits the mark. But if you are looking for one that blossoms inspiration beyond the typical teen fare, that is another story. This film never quite strolls out of the ordinary of coming-of-age formula, and at times gets a little predictable in a few of its proceedings. But Hailee Steinfeld steps foot in the lead role luckily saves the day. The young actress does a solid piece of work at delivering laughs for a fair amount of time she's on screen. From the clever badinage between her and Woody Harrelson, to her chemistry with Hayden Szeto; Steinfeld puts her role as an average angst teenager trapped in a social blackhole to great use. Although the humor occasionally stumbles or falls flat upon arrival, Steinfeld along with most her supporting cast make a redeeming points. The story is nicely paced and remains mostly grounded to reality of what is high school feels like, and the characters themselves (particularly the main character) serve as figures many teens and adults can relate to rather than run-of-the-mill stereotypes.The Edge of Seventeen is a charming, funny coming-of-age comedy destined to appeal to the teen crowd, and certainly a good portion of the adult demographic. It marks a fun, if not groundbreaking comedic role for Hailee Steinfeld. There is anything that halts this film from being a standout in its genre, it may the lack of coming-of-age innovation. Beyond that, it can make a good recommendation."
" Reminiscent of Savage Steve Holland's""Better Off Dead""
",-0.8074,0.9895,2017-03-06 00:00:00,7,"Kelly Furmon Craig pays homage - perhaps subconsciously - to the Savage Steve Holland and Steve Hughes dramadies of The Big 80's with this winning portrait of way over dramatic teenagerhood and the consequences it brings. Hailee Steinfeld nails how every glance, conversation, and text can seem life or death when you are on the edge of seventeen (thanks, Stevie Nicks!). She also nicely mixes in the subconscious search for a father figure after watching her own die of a heart attack. Her surrogate father lies in the person of the bitter, jaded English teacher Woody Harrelson who gets many of the film's best lines (these are not plentiful; having said that the writing is generally good). As an aside, kudos either to Craig, the makeup staff and/or to actor Eric Keenleyside who plays the father and even before his fatal heart attack appears like a man somehow looks like he's overdue for a terminal cardiac episode. Anyway, Steinfeld's Nadine so wraps herself in her own teenage narcissism that when we meet Harrelson's Mr. Bruner's family it feels like a revelation but is only because we have been seeing the world through Nadine's limited vision. So the movie excels in tone, realism and, to a degree comedy but nearly all limited to the Nadine / Bruner dyad. The script could have used some punching up when it comes to side characters including Haley Lu Richardson's Krista and Hayden Szeto's Erwin. Neither is given more to do than to be The Best Friend and The Silver Medal Love Interest respectively. Remember Anthony Michael Hall in ""Sixteen Candles"" doesn't get top billing but nonetheless, Hughes kept him integral to the plot. In short, while not quite the classics ""Better Off Dead"" or ""Sixteen Candles"", the movie contributes an entertaining and somewhat original interpretation on the subgenre."

Besides this film being obvious and so boring that you sigh out loud several times, there is just nothing redeeming about Nadine. I can see that she has had a rough time in life, but her father's death doesn't seem to disturb her nearly as much as her friend dating her brother. And it kind of leads you to think if this is a movie about mental health issued mistaken for a comedy, because Nadine is just angry and rude. I found it hard rooting for a girl that is just a horrible person.The worst part about this film is the message it sends, ""Your life is worth nothing if you don't have a boyfriend"" because that is what is all comes down to. Krista just like Nadie have a 180 on their personality as soon as they get a steady beau. Then you can be open and social and make new friends, if you are single you are not worth anything and you should just stay in your room and get drunk. Alternatively kill yourself, because loosing a parent is not enough to put you over the edge, but your friend dating, that is want to make you jump in front of a truck.

Not able to act like a normal human being... Until she gets a boyfriend her self. Both Krista and Nadie are the kind of girls that have no life, no personality or anything going for them until they get a man by their side. After that life is peachy, such a great story for young girls. You don't need friends, you don't need friendship, what you need is a man on your arm, and life will sparkle. Your other alternative is to claim that you will kill yourself as the drama queen you are.

The viewer sees how Nadine is with her problems and concerns.Everyone is great! Hailee Steinfeld is the ideal actress for the character of Nadine, she is the queen of the film and manages to make her character feel real, getting you to empathize with her and make the film an extraordinary work into the genre.

" Great and highly involving coming of age story
",0.6249,0.9906,2017-02-28 00:00:00,9,"Greetings from Lithuania.While ""The Edge of Seventeen"" (2016) hasn't blow me away in its originality, i still think that it was one of the better coming of age stories I've seen in many moons. Its all just clicked here very well, it is a perfectly balanced comedy which is always on the edge on the drama. Writing (and directing) by Kelly Fremon Craig was great. Acting by Hailee Steinfeld was very good as well as from a supporting cast. Overall, at running time 1 h 40 min i was involved into this movie more then i thought i would be, because it is not a very fresh or original story, but it was written and acted so good that i watched this film in one sit - and that happen kinda rarely these days. When you think ""The Edge of Seventeen"" will go in some predictable way, well, that basically does happen but once again when script is so simple, good and smart it is just a joy to watch. This is a very good coming of age story all around."
" Do you even realize how sick in the head you are for bringing that up?
",-0.5106,-0.9903,2017-02-27 00:00:00,8,"When you watch a teen movie like The Edge of Seventeen you'll usually find yourself siding with either parent in the family like Nadine and her brother do. This time it's the mum who she's constantly at odds with, and the dad who steps in and saves the day. He's the cool one, the one who understands her the most, and when her voice-over warns that ""tragedy soon struck"", we're pretty sure that the movie is gearing up to kill him off. But for a teenager like Nadine that tragedy just might be her insane, out-of-control hairdo and a sprouting monobrow. The resulting punishment of such a fashion faux pas is of course social exclusion, and for a high-schooler those are live-or-die stakes. And then for good measure, her dad dies anyway, and sends her life into a miserable spiral. In most of these young adult stories that alone would be a good enough reason for Nadine to retreat into her shell and start to hate the whole world, and therefore legitimatise all the jaded cynicism and self- pity she radiates with every furious move. But Kelly Fremon Craig doesn't orient us with a timeline, and that provides the opportunity for a wicked takedown of her pity party; Nadine springs the 'my dad just died' to avoid handing in homework, only for Mr Bruner to reveal it is now five years after the fact. The joke effectively pulls the rug from under our feet, and suddenly we're all recalculating, and shifting all those expectations that the genre has instilled into us year after year. The seemingly plucky Nadine is played by Hailee Steinfeld, who broke out with True Grit, a role where she was required to babysit Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon. If you've watched that you'll recognise traces of her ability to scold and talk to down to anyone in her radius, and here it is laced with teenager bitterness and envy - Nadine has single-handedly claimed misanthropy for herself, and anyone who tries to help or improve her (namely her brother and mother) is sent packing. Steinfeld does well with the overlapping, self-important dialogue, but praise must also go to the wardrobe departments, who dress her in puffy retro striped jackets and velcro-laced sneakers, so she's a hipsterish standout amongst the ""mouth-breathing"" crowd. The bright blues and reds make her pop against the dull grey photography; she's an old soul, and dresses not merely as a facet of self-expression, but as rebellion. The movie takes everything we know about cinematic teenagers and flips them around. We're still learning. For so long the status quo was that you were a child, and then an adult, the hard times meaning that no one had any time to grow and develop and mope about growing and developing. Then James Dean opened up his heart and soul, and John Hughes and The Breakfast Club introduced us to the rest of the gang and their own worries and ambitions. The teen movie has almost always been rigidly fixated on the plucky protagonist's point-of-view, celebrating their coming-of-age and phoenix rebirth from loserville. They can do no wrong, and everyone else is there to pat them on the back and boost them up. The Edge of Seventeen isn't just afraid to call Nadine out on her behaviour, it's also mature enough to show her the people who are hurt from these actions. When she taunts her best friend and predicts that she'll eventually be dumped by the hot jock (her brother, no less) for ""someone hotter"", that's years and years of conventional genre experience talking, then the movie reaching up and slapping her in the face for making wild assumptions. Why should Krista be blasted for trying to make friends with someone who isn't the main character? The movie also slyly plays the apparent blandness of Nadine's designate love interest against her; the more she and Erwin hang out, the more crazy discoveries she is making about him, and that only further drives home the point about how self-centred she is and how little listening she actually does. What we need to realise is that there is an entire cluster of kids that aren't wildly partying, downing shots and flaunting their promiscuity (and even if they are, it doesn't make them the bad guys). Instead they're wrapped up in their own bubbles, watching Futurama on the couch and aiming death stares at those who dare tread past their domain. They internalise misery and contempt but are blind to their own faults and ignorance - Blake Jenner's climatic confession is a big whack to the head of the audience and Nadine, who have both built him up the perfect older brother, chiselled and handsome, competent and mature. Nadine isn't the perfect little snowflake that makes the whole school stop still for her, and when she eventually realises this she learns two things. One, she's actually the bad guy of the story. Two, she's not nearly as bad as she might have believed, and with a little help that can be fixed."
" 2 characters/actors make the movie unbearable
",0.0,0.9849,2017-02-26 00:00:00,1,"Those are Blake Jenner who plays the older brother. And the character of Krista. Who cares about her real name, she is a secondary character this film needed. She will go back to the D-list after this.....lolWHY are they still hiring Blake Jenner? I hate him. Let's just get that out of the way. He just looks....off. Maybe since every new actor trying to replace the Glee originals was basically hated. Maybe because he looks deformed, no offence. But mostly since he can't carry a movie. He is meh at best. He failed in Glee, he failed in Everybody Wants Some, and what else did he even do? Does he get hired because he is tall with abs...and the whole Glee singing and dancing thing? Pretty sure there are better looking guys out there that can actually carry and movie, and you know have actual star power.These two ruin this movie for the reason that they are both truly disgusting repulsive characters that are selfish beyond belief. The older brother has been treated better all his life, he turned out better. What a shocker! Then we get turncoat Krista who was BFFs with the main character. But left her in a second for the D....seriously, the scene where the main character learns of her betrayal LITERALLY involves her bothers D. And they later even have a discussion about it.....not even kidding.Just really sick and tired of people BLAMING THE VICTIM. When will it stop!? ""Hey we bullied the heck out of this kid and made his life miserable, why did he snap and kill everyone?"" REALLY? Do these people not hear themselves?I see Nadine as the victim. Played by the lovely and amazingly talented Hailee Steinfeld. I mean wow what a performance! They say she is disagreeable? I wounder why (her life treatment). I mean I was confused who I was supposed to root for. Was I ACTUALLY SUPPOSED to root for the older brother? Who was treated as the golden child? For the supposed BFF who the SECOND she RANDOMLY got a whiff of some D dropped her best friend in a hot minute? Who gets all b!t(#y and judgmental of her and acts all high and mighty as if she is her mother now???? REALLY!?!?!?Just so disgusted by these two characters. If they were TOTALLY cut out of this movie I would have given it 10 stars to be honest. But no it gets 1 since they are in it. Just really hated looking at her former BFFs smug judgmental face. What a b!t(#. Just wow. REALLY filmmakers why did you ruin your movie with these two? I feel like I have to take a shower to clean off the disgust of these two actors/characters. Now the mother of Nadine is also not innocent. But Kyra Sedgwick is such an AMAZING actress, that she adds shades of gray to her character. She makes her character likable. But when you hire Blake Jenner and have a random D-lister try to play characters we are supposedly supposed to root for you eff up the whole thing. They are just jerks, that's it.It's really a shame since Hailee Steinfeld really makes Nadine someone you wanna root for. She is just a girl that wants to be loved, cared for, supported. Is that really bad? Isn't that ALL of us!? I mean really. Why is Nadine of all people painted as the supposed villain? Young and stupid strikes us all. I was so disgusted at how ALL OF A SUDDEN Krista became an adult. Why did she hook up with her BFFs older brother again? Oh yes it was never explained. They need to do a re- edit of this film with NO older brother character or BFF character. Really LOVED Erwin, an adorable character played perfectly by Hayden Szeto. Hell even the guy Nadine liked but turned out to be a 'jerk' (just trying to bang her) was more likable than her older bro and BFF. THAT is how bad those 2 are! OMG I almost forgot Woody Harrelson! At this point this movie stretched the grips of reality that a teacher exists like this. He was a funny character and I loved how he cared so much for Nadine. I mean he could exist, maybe everyone in the school got so used to the way Nadine speaks that they got desensitized? But yeah this movie had lots of good characters, actors, scenes, etc....all over shadowed by the big pile of the steaming dump that is the older brother and the BFF."

",0.0,0.8792,2017-02-24 00:00:00,7,"A stripped back coming-of-age story which deals with love, loss, loneliness, relationships, the human condition and an overarching theme of existentialism; told primarily from the perspective of Hailey Steinfeld's socially awkward/outcast, Nadine.The plot is simple and therefore allows this to be much more of a character study; primarily done through the exploration of different one-on-one conversations held by the six principle protagonists. At times, these interactions are difficult to watch – whether this be through an innate sense of impending dread or simply via anticipating a character's next self-destructive life choice (a plot device the film plays with extremely well through it's use of physical imagery and representation: deleting draft texts; the camera movement to show a character's continually shifting viewpoint; etc.) – but it is difficult not to swell at the sight of character's fulfilling their respective arcs on-screen. Despite the roller coaster director Kelly Fremon Craig takes you on, the Edge of Seventeeen is a movie almost guaranteed to provide uplifting moments of true bliss and at least some room for reflection, regardless of your own personal stance or predicament."

In fact, ""The Edge of Seventeen"" is one of the best movies ever in this genre.Nadine was always friendless and picked on. She never had any friends until one day an ""angel"" fell from the sky. This angel was Krista. They immediately become friends and have each other's back all the way through high school. Nadine's life was pretty much a nightmare. She loses her father (who she thought was her only friend) at an early age. When Krista came along, she finally had something solid. Her mom doted on her brother, Darian, who was the popular jock at high school.Nadine's life seems to be going just fine until after one drunken night with Krista, Nadine wakes up on the bathroom floor, hears some giggling, and walks in on HER best friend...who just happens to be in bed with her brother. Her entire world collapses. In a fit of rage, Nadine tells (not asks) Krista to choose: her or her brother.This movie was well written, well directed, and extremely well acted. Harlie Steinfield plays Nadine as close to the ""truth"" as you can get. Everyone remembers high school, right? It was for some of us the worst times of our lives. It seems Nadine's only friend now is a teacher, Mr. Bruner, wonderfully underplayed by Woody Harrelson. Blake Jenner plays Nadine's brother, Darian, whose life isn't as perfect as Nadine assumes. Hayley Lu Richardson plays Krista, but for me the actor who stole the show was Hayden Szeto, who plays Erwin, a boy who is secretly crazy about Nadine but is paid absolutely no attention.The movie is rated ""R"" for language and adult situations. Hope you enjoy this one as much as I did."

But this one falls way short of making an actual impact such story can make. First of all the protagonist 'Nadine', comes out to be not so real and one who lacks depth. I found it very hard to build a connection with her and was never able to even sympathize. She's so pretty why wouldn't the boys want to hang out with her? Maybe it was a case poor casting ? Other supporting characters also let down with caricature mom and similar brother. Her best friend is also depicted as a boring cardboard character. Humans even adolescents are much are complex and nuanced than that. Also there isn't much action going on in the film and most of them seem out of place. Nothing much exciting or unpredictable happens in the film. It feels like forced entertainment, which is produced only because such movies mostly go down well with the audience. But sorry not this one. I should go back to watch Rushmore or 400 blows or Breakfast Club."

The movie is rated R, and I think that is actually the right rating for this.

This movie is more mainstream than Perks of Being a Wallflower but is relatively geared toward the same audience and has some of the same morals.

" Realistic, but a bit boring and depressing
",-0.7469,0.9735,2017-02-12 00:00:00,4,"Acting, conversation between characters, their stories and events seem genuine, but the storyline isn't quite good. The main character, Nadine, seems to be struggling as a child and during adolescence. The story of Nadine and her best friend was presented pretty well. However, Nadine's brother character, who is very important, doesn't seem really genuine, it's confusing and not deeply enough explained. On the other hand, the context of some important events of this movie is not clear enough. (Don't want to mention which ones, to avoid adding spoilers.)The film portrays very well the downsides of being a teenager. Friendships, family, relationships' problems... Dissatisfaction with misgivings of life. At the end, I must say that the movie was quite boring because most of the time nothing happens. My general opinion is that ""Seventeen"" could have given much stronger message, and that the plot could've been more interesting with more realistic twists, and the main issue of the film better resolved."
" Great Movie!
",0.6588,0.9846,2017-02-09 00:00:00,10,"The Edge of Seventeen is one of a kind, at least in the recent years. Personally, I feel it's one of the first movies I've ever seen that actually conveys what it's like to be a teenager. Unlike other coming-of-age movies, the Edge of Seventeen is realistic. It doesn't show a conventionally beautiful girl and her minor struggles and thirst for popularity which she will almost always get in the end. It shows you that you aren't always going to end up with the popular kids or win the boy of your dreams. Coming from someone who is seventeen Hailee Steinfeld's performance as the 17-year- old, antisocial, angsty, and slightly over-dramatic Nadine is completely accurate. Some might argue that Nadine's over the top reactions to her self- made conflict isn't realistic at all. But isn't that what being a teenager is about? Overreacting? Blowing things out of proportion? And I think this movie portrayed that perfectly. Steinfeld's performance isn't the only thing that deserves praise. Woody Harrelson as Nadine's unprofessionally rude English teacher, Mr. Brunner, is what I think ties the entire movie together. Nadine and Mr. Brunner's sweet but comedic relationship adds a little heart to an otherwise depressing movie. Without this humor, it would just be Nadine's dysfunctional life, and us watching as she stumbles through it. What I think makes this movie so great is that the things Nadine wants at the beginning isn't what she gets at the end and I feel that that's a very important message that needed to be told and The Edge of Seventeen did that flawlessly. Not once did it ever feel cheesy or did the dialogue feel out of place. This movie showed what it's really like to be an awkward seventeen-year-old."

Writer/director Kelly Fremon Craig absolutely nails her debut movie and it's a true joy to watch. The film is about Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) who, as the film implies, is seventeen. Nadine tends to run her mouth off and is anxious and unpopular. When she was thirteen her father, the parent she was closest to, dies abruptly in front of her, leaving the family in disarray. Even four years later, the family is still struggling to hold themselves together. That all changes when Nadine's best (only) friend Krista falls for her older, perfect, brother Darian. Feeling like she's on the verge of losing the only person who really cares for her Nadine issues an ultimatum to Krista and when Krista fails to choose between Nadine or her brother, Nadine makes the decision for her and abruptly cuts off contact between the two of them forcing her to reach out and make new connections. This is just a great movie all the way through. Great cast (one quibble is that Hailee Steinfeld never feels as gawky or as awkward as Nadine is alleged to be, she's like Hollywood plain, i.e. a brunette). Also despite the fact that this is ""just"" a teen movie there are so many beautifully framed shots and Craig never plays it safe with making the movie feel good. A tight, clever script, great cinematography, colours, costumes, everything."

As a classic narrative structure , the film goes backwards to explain the current situation. It adds also a couple of flashbacks about Nadine's childhood in order to built the character. Otherwise, the plot is not very original but works well to deliver its message, even of the character development is a bit too predictable.On the technical aspect, there is not major problem in the editing or directing choices apart maybe for the numerous text messages' scenes with a cut on the phone screen to read the message. It is maybe due to the small budget but other films or TV series use some incrustations on the pictures to show messages allowing to keep the frame on the actor.

I certainly do, and even for a more-than-normal case like me the school years were sometimes like a prison sentence, with hormone-crazed and totally devoid of empathy kids making a mess of each other's lives because they simply didn't know any better.So imagine yourself being a kid again. Now add to this a mother both overbearing and helpless, an older brother who's a light-headed jock who doesn't seem to give a damn about you, a girl who seemingly changes your friendship for a chance to date your sibling and a dad who's perfectly awesome but has unfortunately been dead for four years already. Join this whole list of things together - and there you go, you're in Nadine's shoes. Now go deal with it! Let's see if you manage.The brilliance of the coming-of-age movies these days is how spot-on they manage to be getting into the teens' heads and depicting their lives and the pitfalls of those. Maybe it's the whole infantilism of the current generation of screenwriters having an upper side after all, or maybe they do hire real teenagers as out-of-staff consultants, but it seems like almost every single serious teen movie I've seen in the last couple years knew exactly what buttons to push to bring back the adolescence memories and feelings you thought were long buried and gotten over.This time it's a bit different though, because I, as a male, had never been inside a head of a girl going through growing up and maturing. And, truth be told, that's a very messy experience. The mood swings, the unexpected desires and unlikely dilemmas... Watching The Edge of Seventeen definitely feels like an out-of-body experience, thanks to Hailee Steinfeld's intense and eerily complicated character. I can't claim that I know what girls really go through in that age, but, judging from my personal experience of communicating with people, she did an unbelievable job portraying a troubled young woman going through that period of her life. The fact that she hadn't got an Oscar nomination for this role makes me wonder what JLaw had been critically acclaimed for in the first place. But I digress...Now let me ask you a question. If you did find all the people around you either self-centered or being jerks or outright primitive, and if you felt lonely because of the vacuum those people, or the lack thereof, were creating around you, what would you do? Would you rather fly solo until you actually met a soul who shares some traits with yours? Or would you give in to the pressure and simply try to adapt and imitate similarities with all those people? Just a little time ago we've seen how the latter looks, in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl. And while that movie tells a very different story, one thing it tells for sure is that imitation is never a solution.That's why it's been a surprising pleasure to see that in TEoS Nadine went on to openly rebelling against the system, both letting it hurt herself and actually admitting to not willing to comply. Those passionate monologues of a half-grown person both immature and dependent and at least honest about her own difference from the rest of the pack, are as naive as they are respectable. At least I wish I was as bold and daring in her age.And then... there were the issues. The awkward scenes and the moments of totally erratic behavior even I could feel ashamed of, simply because you could put yourself in her position and know how it's gonna feel a moment later. The Edge of Seventeen not only does a great job showing us the insides of a female teen's life, but also avoids the sin of idealizing its protagonist, so we actually see Nadine not as a precocious young person well ahead of her age but as a vulnerable kid who sometimes acts irrational or even dumb. That honesty with the audience is what really helps us stay tuned to the development of Nadine's character and care for her.Yet for some reason the filmmakers didn't dare to go as far as did the authors behind The Perks of Being a Wallflower. They didn't dare to avoid an ending which would sprinkle some sweet harmonization all over, making our heroine change overnight and become all convenient and agreeable. As if starting to smile at people and participate in those nice warm small talks would actually change the people around and turn them from the selfish creatures we all are into someone actually altruistic or putting your needs first or even caring about you when they already have what they need. That's the biggest lie people tend to tell themselves and each other: that if you treat someone right they'll do the same back at you. Bullsh!t, the truth is, the people will just keep doing what they are programmed to do, whether it's caring for their own needs only or trying to dedicate a segment of their lives to yours as well. And if there ever could be any moral in a story about becoming an adult, it should have been not ""be positive and the people will be drawn to you"" but rather ""learn to tell selfish a$$holes from those who care, and set your priorities accordingly"". If we could somehow follow that simple logic, the whole life would've become a lot easier."
" An excellent feel good movie for all ages and genders
",0.765,0.9786,2017-02-06 00:00:00,8,"I can't understand how some can write poor reviews for this movie especially after watching blockbusters such as Arrival, which was long, arduous and often too quiet to hear the dialogue. The Edge of Seventeen is about an awkward teen trying to find her way in the world. Yes an old story, but every single actor works their chops off in this movie and there is not one single poor or even average performance. They all excel and also they all have fabulous chemistry on screen. One of my real pleasures watching it was that you could hear all the dialogue, and while there was music of course it never interfered with the film as a lot of new films seem to allow. Excellent cinematography with no shaky cameras or too-dark-to-see scenes, and the dialogue was in fact exactly what you'd expect to hear from those people in those situations. There was no ""uptalk"" that is popular at the moment but which I despise, where people speak sentences which are statements, but end on a high note as if that statement was delivered as a question. I hate that, it's so childish and affected, and there was none of it so I was very pleased. While there was a small sex scene there was no attempt to over sexualise the teens in the movie gratuitously as is often common. It was focused on the story of them and their experiences and while it dealt with difficult issues it did so with aplomb and humour and intelligence. Hailee Steinfeld rocks this movie and although she is 20 now she really nails the teen angst/passion/enthusiasm/cynicism/hate/love easily and completely. She owns the role and the film and I think we're going to see some stunning performances from her in the future. All in all an excellent film and I will definitely be watching this one again."

Let me start by saying the movie certainly won't be everybody's cup of tea, its a comedy/drama (sort of) coming of age flick full of the usual clichés and predictable stuff you have seen hundreds of times before.Given what I've just written you might think I'm slagging it off, which I suppose I am in a way but what the movie does well, it does very well and the performances of both Woody Harrelson and Hailee Steinfeld can only be admired, its quite well written as well and you actually care about some of the characters.The biggest let down was the ending, it felt kind of rushed like they had run out of money or the run time was deemed too long so everything sort of comes hurriedly to an abrupt halt with everything ""sorted out"" in the last 10 minutes. Still worth a watch though on a rainy afternoon. A solid 7.5 out of 10 I think seems about fair."
" The Peanuts Movie did it better.
",0.4404,0.9858,2017-02-06 00:00:00,3,"It's not the clichés. It's not the fumbling, thoroughly unfunny dialogue. It's not the one-dimensional characters (besides Woody Harrelson's character). It's not the excruciatingly painful awkwardness of every social encounter. It's not even the completely unlikable protagonist (quote: ""They're all mouth=breathers... I am an old soul""). What really bothers me about this movie was that after all the cringe, after all the ""realness,"" that it lacked the balls to reach a real conclusion. You feel helpless because you hate so many things about yourself but you'll never be able to change any of them? A hug can fix that. You're ugly but also too superficial to settle for less than perfection? Don't worry, some kind, rich, handsome guy (who's even less socially adept than you) will come along and settle for you, even if you friendzone him. Twice. There is a certain group of people who will absolutely adore this movie. They enjoy wallowing in self-pity, because it makes them feel special. If you're not this type of person, don't waste your time."
" Remarkable Dialogue, didn't want it to end.
",0.5232,0.9387,2017-02-05 00:00:00,8,"One of the best coming of age movies I've seen, it offers a realistic and relatable take on family issues and teenage angst, no character is written one dimensionally and put into a box just to serve the plot, no one is made out to be the bad guy but very realistically everyone is just caught up in the confusions and hardships of life.It does have its flaws like the main character getting away with undeservedly being an asshole to everyone when she got angry (this could have been justified with her mom due to their rocky relationship and her mother faults), the least believable part about the ending is not her sudden change but more so that everyone was fine with it, surely someone would be upset with her after some of her behavior, she's often unlikable though I did personally relate and emphasize with her.That being said I enjoyed the movie and the dialogue so much that I'm easily able to look over some of its flaws. Overall an amazing coming of age movie."
" It is So Difficult to Find a ""10""
",-0.4201,0.9547,2017-02-05 00:00:00,10,"I have seen a lot of good movies in the last year. From all genres. I was hesitant about this one. I am mainly a thriller or drama fan.I finally decided to see it after more clips with Woody Harrelson and Hailee Steinfeld. This film captures a family tragedy, a young woman growing into adulthood and all the details in between. How many times can one laugh and have happy or sad tears all at the same time in one movie? Over and over is the answer, for this movie. I was glued to the screen and it could have been longer, I would not have minded. The soundtrack is is just icing on a perfectly layered cake.The ending was GREAT, have no idea why some posters were unhappy with it. I imagine there is a ton on the cutting room floor I want a peek at. The acting and pacing is perfect. The comedy, both obvious and understated is genius. One of Woody Harrelson's best performances. Animation fans will get a little treat, as well.Hayden Szeto is a breath of fresh air. This movie is a perfect 10. I am sure that movies more epic in scope and historical will be up for Oscars, but it would be a great shame if this one was looked over.It's been said by at least one critic, but John Hughes would have indeed been proud."
" Predictable but fun and charming
",0.8922,0.9931,2017-02-04 00:00:00,9,Edge of Seventeen I found to be a joy to watch from beginning to end. It was one of the more joyous films I had ever seen in my life. I was floored with it from start to finish. Hailee Steinfield captivates you from beginning to end. The jokes given to her are delivered in such fun and engaging ways. The story of this youthful teen is done in such a sweet and inviting way. It really understands what it can feel like to be a young teen just growing up in the world. And that was something I really did enjoy. The film also respects all of its characters. Giving them each interesting dimensions. It really allows them all to develop quite a lot. This made for a film that while a bit predictable gave it some edge. The characters themselves aren't complete clichés and are each written like real live human beings with thoughts and feelings. Every character here feel real and emotionally moving.This film gets that people are complex and have a lot of different emotions going through them. It is funny and charming and I adored it.
" deeply disappointed...
",0.0,-0.9382,2017-02-04 00:00:00,3,"Lured by the good reviews we watched it - actually I was looking forward to it very much, but I was left deeply disappointed. The movie is well made, the story might be a little bit foreseeable, but it is in most ""teenage movies"", but the main character is so difficult to relate to, it's horrible. Every other character is more likable, it somehow hurts to watch and ruins the whole movie. The teacher played by Woody Harrelson is great and that's what earned the three points. You somehow want to make it stop, but still obviously due to some masochistic tendencies we endured it till the end. It could have been great but it simply isn't, as much as it hurts."
" A silly teen flick with the odd dirty line
",-0.6249,-0.8967,2017-02-04 00:00:00,6,"""The Edge of Seventeen"" is a typical PG-13 teen girl flick which just happens to have its mind in the gutter. With the potty mouthed characters, underage drinking, and implied sexual acts, it feels like this is a movie reaching for greater realism, but never grasping it.The main character is the typical adult-in-a-child's-body that anyone who has seen any other teen flicks will recognize. Sure, she's not perfect, but adults aren't perfect either. The thing is she is always so self-aware and reflective that it is hard to believe she has actual faults. These characters are so separate, not only from real teenagers, but real people in general, that to encounter one would be like meeting an alien trialing human emotions in a public sphere. Or, you know, an actor, acting.The problems the character has are of the soap opera, luxury variety: her best friend is dating her hated, over-achieving brother. This would be more of an issue if she really had any reason for hating him. Someone who is capable of constantly witty, reflective dialogue, parodying herself and pointing out the ridiculousness of her hopes and fears, should not have such a massive problem with this.""The Edge of Seventeen"" is reluctant to commit to having a believably flawed protagonist, and it's similarly craven in regards to whether it wants to be an edgy, realistic look at teen life or just another ""Mean Girls""."
" That poor teacher...
",-0.4767,-0.9839,2017-02-03 00:00:00,2,"You know that feeling when critics and everybody around you praise some movie and give it the best rating, while you think it's a bowl of poop? Yea...This is a story of 17 years old girl Nadine. Nadine has problems. Nobody likes her, her brother is a douche bag, she misses her father that's just passed away, her only friend starts dating her brother, her mother doesn't understand her, she's depressed and overall misery and angst.That's what people responsible for this poop want you to think. All I see is self centered, loud, annoying brat with imaginary problems, no hobbies, terrible personality and true, scary aggression of a raging bull boiling under her skin. She was supposed to be this sad character that audience is supposed to identify with and care about. But I didn't. I was amazed how Nadine kept doing the dumbest things imaginable over and over again, how many old teenage movies plot tricks there are, how every 'person' in this movie is just a plot device to push the 'story' a bit further, how muddled and awkward this bore fest feels.The only good thing about the movie was in the title of my review. The teacher, played by Woody Harrelson. And by the way, apparently in that school there's only this one guy, because you never see other teachers or our heroine taking some other classes. So our main character is constantly coming to him to throw up her verbal diarrhea about her miserable life and the guy wants to help her, but she doesn't listen, because she's just sad, annoying brat with mental problems.Few words about R rating. There are 2 categories of R rated movies. The ones that feel natural, where violence and profanity feels like an integral part of a story (Tarantino and Scorsese movies for example) and movies like Edge of Seventeen in which characters just swear a lot. It comes out as fake and forced and it doesn't impress me in the least.SPOILERS ABOUT THE ENDING The ending is just laughably bad. The change of Nadine's character is one of the most unconvincing in movie history. She just magically turns 180 degrees overnight. Angst is gone, problems don't matter anymore, she's just happy person all of the sudden! She even starts dating this talentless, rich, clearly retarded (can't even construct a proper sentence) Asian guy that was hitting on her for the entire run time of a movie and everything's fine now, happiness is all around, so hooray. I guess.END OF SPOILERS So yea, The Edge of seventeen. A movie about loud, aggressive girl with imaginary problems and poor Woody Harrelson plopped as a cherry on top of a crap cake.2/10, terrible movie."

I am 20 this year and I haven't kissed anyone not mention the loss of virginity. Life sucks. I am not ugly but I'm not confident or think myself as an attractive person. It's a good film in every way. One thing I don't agree with is the ending. It's hard for a so-called loser to find the right track. Because no one will ever notice you. There are not always happy endings.What matters is to live for yourself.

It feels like whatever they showed you inside the trailer, just picture all that with some filler scenes in it and the film is complete. The initial ratings of this movie are alluring but it certainly disappoints. I think the concept of the film isn't something new. But I genuinely expected more turnouts from it. The end feels incomplete, the climax isn't something you won't expect. In the end, I think I'll prefer 'Kings of Summer' or even 'The Way Way Back'"
" 8.5/10
",0.0,0.9986,2017-02-01 00:00:00,8,"Everyone knows that growing up is hard, and life is no easier for high school junior Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld), who is already at peak awkwardness when her all-star older brother Darian (Blake Jenner) starts dating her best friend Krista (Haley Lu Richardson). All at once, Nadine feels more alone than ever, until the unexpected friendship of a thoughtful boy (Hayden Szeto) gives her a glimmer of hope that things just might not be so terrible after all.Being a huge follower of the coming of age/teen drama from the Hughes days in 80s to all of the modern incarnations, I was very excited by the prospect of another teen dromedy and getting to finally see it was a real plesure, full of brilliant witty comedy in the same measure of heartfelt drama.What strikes me the most about this film is the fact that its a debut feature for director Kelly Fremon Craig. She demonstrates a confidence in the storytelling that is something we have seen from very few debuts. The material is so varied and touches, as said above, the extremes in both comedy and drama, yet the coherence in the tone of the film never, ever wavers, every scene, as in all great storytelling, catapults us into the next one, the characters constantly evolve and learn new things and probably, the very best part, is that everyone of them, from leading to secondary supporting, has a truly three dimensional dynamic, you understand where all of them come from, nobody is condemned to a clichéd flatness and from this emerges constantly entertaining conflict.The cast is a showcase of great actors making justice to great characters, none of them come out as seen-before characters, they all find a place in the story and make the most out of what they can do with the fascinating script. Other than the fact that Steinfield's work is Oscar level acting, she gives such a beautiful portrayal of the sadness in the character she plays and how she comes out of it. Hayden Szeto has to be mentioned in particular besides her because his timing, his awkwardness and ultimately his heartfelt performance make for a very, very good, touching, quirky and genuine character.This film perfectly incarnates the vision is sets out to complete, it is surprising and unpredictable at every turn, constantly engaging you in the novelty of the characters, it has character narration done incredibly right. The beauty of laughing hard in a scene and going to the completely opposite emotional spectrum five minutes later and feel elated by both of the dynamics is a joy very few films manage to nail and ""Edge of Seventeen"" does that, it is an incredibly mature film in the way it faces its themes and gives, in my humble opinion, a very good example. I had a blast with this film."

Movie reflects today's teenagers struggle with finding themselves and people they want to trust. Showing how teenagers are judgmental and how they are able to react to depression finally gives a great experience inside this movie. It has a great drama followed with many comedy that lights things up and then brings harsh truth about everything. Next time when somebody mentions comedy or drama genre first movie that has so highlighted drama and comedy but combined together to perfection. Absolutely magnificent work by Kelly Craig a first fully written, directed and produced movie and such a great and powerful storytelling. Hailee Steinfeld played Nadine and what a job did she do. This is one powerful and moving performance by such a young actress that will surely have a great things in front of her. Her emotions, charisma and truthfulness were astonishing. The master Woody Harrelson reminded us what a powerful and great guy and actor he is. His talent is also beyond everything how he manages to give a comedic/dramatic performance in one single scene. 4/4"
" The Edge of Seventeen
",0.0,0.9975,2017-02-01 00:00:00,8,"If taken purely as a comedy, it's not the funniest film in the world (although it has plenty of very funny moments) but compared to other films of this genre (coming-of- age drama/teen comedy), its one of the best out there.Hailee Steinfeld plays Nadine, a teenager with only one friend, struggling to find her way in life. She doesn't get on very well with her family either. Things get worse when her best friend Krista starts dating her brother Darian. It is a pretty basic plot and something which we have seen plenty of in the past but with Hailee Steinfeld giving an outstanding performance in the lead role, this film had a likable character that I actually cared for. Usually in films like this it's ALL about sex, and although this film did revolve around sex at times, it was more about her character growing as a person, overcoming her struggles, meeting new people & making new friends. There was a lot of depth to Nadine's character and the scenes with Woody Harrelson (teacher) were some of the best moments. It was a thoroughly enjoyable film but I wish it had been tied up a bit better at the end. Although you get the general idea with the ending, it would've been nice to see a little more. Maybe there will be a part 2 to carry it on further but if not its still an excellent film which I highly recommend. 8/10."
" The Razor Sharp Edge
",0.0,0.9926,2017-01-30 00:00:00,9,"Coming of age movies are box office winners but The Edge of Seventeen is a critical success. It is the compelling portrayal of a struggling teen unable to deal with the razor sharp edges of high school life. We see the forces of peer pressure tormenting Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) when her only friend (Haley Lu Richardson) finds a loving relationship with her handsome brother Darian (Blake Jenner) and social acceptance from his group of friends. Darian has his own painful story that neither Nadine nor many of us bother to read because we have already judged that book by its cover. We watch Kyra Sedgwick (Mona) tip the teetering balance between her strengths and weaknesses with a single two letter word and lastly see Woody Harrelson play his typecast role of the older, wiser mentor (Mr. Bruner) to perfection. Harrelson has amassed an impressive body of work ranging from a renegade cop in Rampart to a skilled illusionist in Now You See Me. This movie has clever humour, disturbing pain, and an uplifting end. Hailee Steinfeld's Golden Globe performance easily outshines her Academy Award role in True Grit."

The difference is that this one hit the mark on entertainment with sympathy and understanding and great comedy.I wont say too much more except that if you haven't seen this one, or MBTS, see both and you will agree, but see this one last so you will regain some happiness and humor from the loss of emotions after watching MBTS (or if you've seen MBTS already, then see this one for a pleasant refresher).

Nothing to do with Juno or Clueless (as the trailer displayed) Truly being seventeen is not being totally selfish, mean, impolite, irritating and unsympathetic! The story is about a self-adsorbed bitch that in the last 5 minutes figures out that other people have problems and that she should be a better person. Yeah if all the people in the world got so many chances as you did and everyone was so forgiving! Also the fact that sex is such a cool issue for a virgin so much that she sends her crush(who thinks she is a loser with a capital L) a place to do it, had me in laughing tears of what I am seeing. Oh yeah! Sexting is a thing now and everyone has a pool in his house! Even if these things do happen should a movie portray them like that? But the only thing that saved this movie is the actors and the music! Woody Harrelson is amazing as always and the only one that cracked some jokes in this film!

Maybe it's cultural thing. But my impression of school has always been,that people tease you for that stuff. But her brother got no grief for it.And she seem to fit in really well with his friends,which was also a bit strangeThey have tried to take everything that was good or funny in the J.Hughes movies. But they've missed the whole essence of it. The reason they ended breakfast club with them all leaving school,was cause come Monday you can bet everything was back to the normal social standards.You can't take out the highlights of old teen movies,and just add some new stuff, and turn them into a new movie.It need more substance.It also have a lot of sixteen candles in it.But missed out on all the funny bits.

The movie does have many entertaining moments, but also a lot of predictable groan-worthy, eye- rolling bits, too. Does Haillee's character really have to dress like she's bucking to be the least attractive girl in her school? I'm no fashion maven, but enough already with the black tights and tennies. Bleah.I'm already way off track here. Please don't get me wrong: I enjoyed watching this. I particularly liked ""breakout star"" (as ""they"" are calling him) Hayden Szeto. Watch this film to see him, if for no other reason. It's terrific how he nails High School awkwardness when, in reality, he is 31 years of age. Yep. Those Asians sure have a knack for looking young, young, young. Blast their hides.Blake Jenner, on the other hand (age 24) is seriously miscast as Hailee's older brother. Who was it who thought this manly hunk could pass for a High School Senior? What a joke. That said, having ""discovered"" Blake (didn't we all?) in ""Everybody Wants Some,"" I have to say that watching him in action is certainly immensely pleasurable. He is one gorgeous and talented guy. He does a great job of playing the brother, but only if you pretend he's a College Senior.Woody Harrelson, after his stupendous acting in Zombieland and No Country for Old Men, continues to grow and mature and evolve as an actor. (I know that sounds trite and even cornball, but it is true.) I love watching him. This film has him playing the stereotypical ""I don't care, but yes I do care"" teacher. He has some great lines, though, and that kind of makes up for the two-dimensional part he is given in this.All in all, I would say you could do a lot worse than watch ""The Edge of Seventeen."" Just because I didn't suffer as a High School seventeen-year-old doesn't make it any less believable to me that others did suffer and suffer mightily. And who doesn't like a good story about an angst-ridden teenager confronting her inner demons and taking it out verbally on others? (Apologies to Cassandra Clare, City of Ashes for the blatant plagiarism.)See the movie and judge for yourself. Blake is totally miscast, am I right?"

These were the only moments that I really enjoyed and thankfully there were a few of them. Most of the rest of the film was entirely forgettable.The revenge of Long Duck Dong as Asian Americans get a representative who is a little cooler than the John Hughes slur from 16 Candles. In this version he is stinking rich so that we can accept him a little more because a middle class or, god forbid, a lower middle class Asian boy would just be unacceptable.The less ""acting"" we see from teenagers in a movie the better. This means no crying scenes and really not much in the way of what you might call real emotion because it's just tedious to watch and completely unconvincing so please, please stop! If you want to make a teen comedy then make a damn comedy and try to limit the DRAMA (James Earl Jones voice over for that last word).Way too much drama from this over-privileged little spoiled brat. Screw her and all of her teen problems none of which approaches anything even remotely essential to what anyone would consider a decent life. Does she think that everyone is guaranteed a boyfriend and love while in high school? Jesus, grow the F up already. Few kids this age can handle relationships involving sex and everything that goes along with that. I don't think that many university students are ready for that kind of commitment which usually drains the individuality right out of them.High school is something that almost everyone simply survives so that hopefully you can go on to have something approaching a satisfying life. Most of the people who had these supposedly satisfying relationships at that age went on to marry the slobs they were with or someone exactly like them a few years later. News flash: most of them went on to be the butt of jokes for all of the kids who were dorks in school.But for any problems I had with rich kids with problems the end was sweet, so there's that."

And you know that other thing where you wonder if the world of reviewers and movie watchers that leave reviews were all on drugs or drunk or distracted or didn't watch the movie but gave a review for some reason or another while thinking ""hey, people say it is good"" and ""hey, why don't I compliment it in the same way others have"" and then they write their pretentious dribble about what is basically a second-rate after school special from back in the day in America when networks would make those corny ""life lessons for teens"" melodramas which had nothing of any value in them but showcased young pretty people in the hopes of getting ratings from teens and tween girls who just got home from school and didn't want to watch talk shows or game shows and were bored wit nothing to do? And you know that thing were a studio or producer or writers has a checklist of ""moments"" that they start off in the hopes of getting a hit and then write a script based on that even though every single scene is hackneyed and literally has nothing to offer except some pretty actors speaking like a writer, a bad writer at that instead of anything even remotely fresh, interesting, fun, etc, etc, etc?"

",0.6249,0.9905,2017-01-22 00:00:00,7,"We all know teenage girls are an enigma, even to them self a lot of the time. Some of the things they say and do and get bothered by are utterly bizarre to the rest of us. 'The Edge of Seventeen' is a film that does a great job of exploring this bizarre phenomenon. It's a comedy with mostly surreal characters, that somehow manage to create an excellent level of reality. It never appears to want to take itself too seriously, yet at certain times it also demands to be.This is the debut film for writer/director Kelly Fremon Craig and I have to say I was thoroughly impressed. Large portions of the movie are absolutely masterful and the only thing holding it back from being truly great is some polishing here and there.I read a quote from someone saying if John Hughes was still alive this could easily be one of his movies. I questioned myself during the film about whether I agreed with that. I did in part, but also found that it was lacking the structuring he always managed to achieve in his films. The characters lived up to his fantastic ability, but the story couldn't quite match it. I feel he would have had another layer in there that drove things and kept everyone's motivations relatable.All said and done though this is a very good effort for a first timer. Being a film maker who can create great characters is a terrific skill to have, because it means there is zero limits to the type of films you can create. I look forward to seeing where Craig's career goes to from here."
" Great dialogue in a flawed movie about a very aggressive girl
",0.4951,0.8372,2017-01-21 00:00:00,3,"Here's the thing, this movie paints a very authentic portrayal as life as a teenager, and the dialogue is fantastically well written, being funny, cutting and emphatic. The problem is the main character quite literally creates almost all her own drama and problems through being aggressive to everyone around her, and then does it again, again and again.It's not the teenage angst or the introverted awkwardness (both of which she has in spades and which are reasonable character traits for her to have), it's the fact that she consistently verbal attacks her friend & family, especially when they are trying to apologise or reason with her kindly; and this aggression is often the only thing driving the story. I guess that could be considered perfectly realistic, but it makes everything in the movie so predictable and hard to feel much sympathy for her.(SPOILERS) Unsurprisingly life gets consistently worse and worse for her and if you stop the movie when she goes to bed five minutes before the end, the main character is exactly the same as at the beginning: selfish, aggressive and with no confidence (so zero character development there). Lo and behold she wakes up a completely different person: confident, polite and kind to all around her - an utterly unbelievable and unrealistic transformation, literally overnight.So I'd have to say it's a mostly fun movie, with well written dialogue, but a repetitive story and a sloppy tacked-on ending."
" A better film is hard to find. Funny and tragic.
",0.34,0.9981,2017-01-16 00:00:00,10,"If I could only shower enough praise on this film I would. I don't think such volumes are possible. Few films I have seen began with more tepid anticipation and finish with such wonder. As the credits rolled I realized I had a wide grin on my face that I wore the entire 90 minutes while watching. Such is the wonder of ""Edge of Seventeen,"" a directorial debut by Kelly Fremon Craig that joins the ranks of ""Juno"" and ""Breakfast Club"" to become a quintessential high school flick. More so than that, this movie rises above the tropes to become something I'm sure many people will be talking about for a while.For such high praise I will tell you that this is a predictable movie. It follows many of the conventions we would come to expect about an awkward girl navigating her Junior year of high school. Our heroine, Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) is an awkward, confrontational girl who has always lived in the shadow of her popular brother, Darian (Blake Jenner, who also starred in ""Everybody Wants Some!"" earlier this year). Her one friend, Krista, is a source of strength throughout her education, and they grow up as the closest friends. One weekend with their mother out of town, Krista and Darian meet up and soon begin dating. Nadine sees this as an ultimatum: her best friend must choose either her or her brother. There can be no compromise. She chooses the boy.What follows is a descent into the awkward stages of high school that so many films in the past have glossed over. In the years before college, social status is what makes or breaks you. If you don't have friends you have nothing, and with Nadine losing all her chips in one fell swoop, she is forced to analyze her life and what little meaning is left in it. Her mother, a control freak with a few shining moments but little knowledge of how to raise a girl, is oftentimes absent and unhelpful in her advice to her young daughter. Her father, who passed away when Nadine was 13, was the one source of solace in her life, and now it would appear that she is unhinged.So begins a fiery relationship with her teacher, Mr Bruner (Woody Harrelson as one of the great teachers in movies). She criticizes his lectures and only seeks to belittle his efforts. Bruner, in turn, dishes it back to Nadine and makes fun of her lack of friends and social status. It's a complicated dynamic that eventually shapes itself into one of respect as Mr Bruner slowly fills that gap left in the absence of her father. Along with the professor, Nadine begins chatting with a classmate, Erwin, who is clearly infatuated with her in the most lovingly-awkward portrayal. Nadine only has eyes for Nick, the hottie rebel who spent time in juvie and works at the local pet store.There is a strong identity I felt with Nadine, a girl who hides behind a rough facade to protect a more fragile heart. Hailee Steinfeld (herself an Oscar nominee for ""True Grit"") hits all the right notes and with any luck would return to the Oscar ceremony for a richly- deserved nomination playing a young girl simply navigating the hardships of maturation. Her delivery of the dialogue presents some of the funniest moments, and her timing is impeccable. Kelly Fremon Craig, a first-time director no less, dazzles with a thought- provoking script that has all the workings and understandings of a tenured filmmaker.There's something very special about ""Edge of Seventeen"" that isn't blatantly apparent when I rethink it. It's a straightforward comedy with the expected rising action, an emotional climax, and a happy ending with a bow on top. Predictable, yes, but boring, not in a million years. I think there is a lot that audiences could identify with, and I'm sure that accounts for it's enormous success among critics and audiences so far. This isn't a story that sugarcoats childhood and youth and makes it something inconsequential. This is a story where we understand the full weight of any given situation and find ourselves utterly invested in the outcome. That's all thanks to a great cast and talented writer/director. What an achievement."
" One big quirky, intelligent and funny coming-of-age cliché.
",0.7096,0.9933,2017-01-13 00:00:00,7,"Coming-of-age films appeal to most audiences but some never realise that it's a genre full of gender stereotypes. Male coming-of-age films are about high-risk adventure, physical challenge, and enduring friendships, while the female versions are about popularity, mean girlfriends and emotional insecurity. Manhood is usually portrayed as dramatic achievement while womanhood is a melodrama of anxiety and victimhood: are these the only options? Such clichés are alive and well in The Edge of Seventeen (2016).The plot line follows the narrative shape of most coming-of-age films. At 17, Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) is a gawky, angst-filled over-thinker who hits the edge of teenage sanity when she finds herself in an emotional vortex. Her father died a while ago; her mother is a bit loony; she worries about her looks; and the mean girls are giving her hell. Life sucks, and then the cruncher: her lifelong best (and only) friend Krista starts dating her infuriatingly perfect older brother. Betrayed beyond belief, Nadine busts up with Krista and ends up chronically lonely. When her secret crush turns sour, she gravitates to a sweet nerdy guy who has been watching her from afar. Throughout all of this is her sardonic teacher, Mr Bruner, who tells her that she'll have to join the queue if she wants to talk about suicide during his lunch hour.While the plot line is one big cliché, the casting and acting are simply outstanding. The spotlight is totally on Nadine and she shines in every scene. She is the quintessential uncool teenage girl: gorgeous without knowing it; street smart about everything and nothing; juggling a dozen emotional balls at once; but still a sweet kid who needs a hand to survive the usual mistakes that must be made on the way to growing up. She is needy, defiant, and funny all at once, while Krista and Mr Bruner bring out the best and worst in her.Does this film raise the standard of stereotypes in the female coming-of-age story? No, not at all, and melodrama seems to be an inescapable part of the deal. But it tells the story in a refreshing way with an intelligent script delivered mostly through Nadine's quirky personality, aided by a top support cast. With a natural filming style and a great soundtrack, this story is told with realism, charm and hope."
" Flawless coming of age story
",0.5106,0.9831,2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,"Even going in with good expectations due to the positive reviews, I was very impressed with this simple, heart touching gem of a film. Everything is perfect. The script is flawless. The acting is superb. The story is very topical to modern times. Every scene is filled with either happiness or sadness. There are no 'boring' scenes. The film starts off strong, continues without wasting a single second on screen, and finishes beautifully. None of the characters act 'out of character' for their respective roles and this is what makes the story even truly more believable. Every character has been crafted beautifully by the writer, portrayed unbelievably by the respective actors, and directed with precision and fine eye for detail to bring the emotion of every scene true to life. The film is rated MA - RESTRICTED for under 15's in Australia and R in other America. I have heard so many people say there is nothing explicitly graphic in this film; there's no need for the highly restrictive rating. Well, I tell you what - this kind of reasoning is exactly what has lead to the downfall of young teenagers and adolescents. There is plenty in this movie, in my opinion, to warrant the restrictive rating. Nothing explicit; but plenty of reasons. The film is a very realistic portrayal of youth today, and shows the difficulties of fitting in with a world so ever fast changing for the worst - at many times very neglectful actions with grave consequences are shown as glorified and justified (for the intention of filling the film's purpose) and for this reason youth who attend this film will get WRONG IDEAS about major decisions they make in their life. Albeit, my criticisms are of no value, since 90% of the cinemas was filled with 12 year old's in their groups of guys and gals cuddling and meddling with each other throughout the film and giggling at credits - this is precisely the reason why films like this should not be watched by these kids yet not only is the restrictive rating not enforced by cinemas (obviously), but even much worse, the parents! Kids have been left with no guidance or support and left to roam - we have a movie that essentially demonstrates this quite well (among many other relevant ideas) and yet the people watching the film are the kids themselves! There is nothing traditionally 'epic' about the edge of seventeen, but yet it is a masterpiece of pure simplicity which is almost impossible to achieve in cinema. Do yourselves a favour - watch this film to learn how youth is developing to apply better parenting at home! Don't bring the kids. 9.5/10"
" From the Edge
",0.0,0.9575,2017-01-05 00:00:00,7,"Life proves challenging for a teenage social miscast when she chooses to ignore her only friend in this bubbly comedy-of-age comedy starring Hailee Steinfeld. It is a performance that earned Steinfeld a Golden Globe nomination and good reviews. Her narcissistic, cynical character is not always easy to relate to, however, Steinfeld brings enough wit and spunk to the role that she always feels like a real human being, if an incredibly impulsive one. Her brother and mother are also well-written characters who gradually seem less and less like stereotypes as the film chugs along. Solid as the characters are, the plot is not exactly new or original with a 'love is closer than you think' angle almost identical to Steinfeld's previous film, 'Barely Lethal'. Hayden Szeto is, however, perfectly cast as the potential love interest in question. Between his nervous mannerisms, wicked sense of humour and private celebrations while trying to woo Steinfeld, he manages to come off as incredibly down-to-earth. Woody Harrelson is also well cast as an ostensibly lazy history teacher who Steinfeld seems to perceive as a kindred spirit of sorts, and the film additionally offers Kyra Sedgwick her most dynamic turn in years as Steinfeld's long-suffering mother who is not quite as oppressive as she initially seems to be. In fact, one of the most refreshing things about the film is the lack of antagonists. There are no teenage 'mean girls', selfish jocks, odious siblings or evil teachers in the mix. Everybody present is a flawed a human being. How many teen films can one say that about?"
