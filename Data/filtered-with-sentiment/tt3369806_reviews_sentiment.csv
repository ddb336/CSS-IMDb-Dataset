",0.7249,0.7766,2020-12-07 00:00:00,10,"I recently watched this movie and really liked it !!
This movie is so much better than other new, cool movies !!
It's not just about sex and brutality !
And not just a doggy family adventure movie !!
It has serious content !!
How an animal (dog) can change a person's life
Not a perfect movie! There are mistakes!!
BUT let's look at its content and not just for kids !!
One of the most significant movies I have ever seen for me !!
I recommend anyone to watch and not just watch brutal, scary, horrible movies !!
Such a movie is much more valuable than other famous big movies !+I'm sorry about the second partðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥
The real is family adventure movie with no more content !!
I was expecting more from a MAX 2 !!"
" Well, they fooled me.
",-0.128,-0.9169,2020-04-27 00:00:00,5,"I thought this was going to be a movie about family & country & a loyal dog.
Nope. This was so silly.
The beginning started strong. But it turned out to be this smart & loyal dog helping an immature teenager out of his (very!) bad choices.
Plus, the teenagers were awful actors & it made the whole dumb storyline even worse. The ending practically disintegrated into a mess.
I'm so disappointed."
" A heart not at its right place
",0.0,0.8199,2019-10-14 00:00:00,3,"Max has a very emotional story which could make true animal lovers moist eyed. But its dull and uneven narration fails to make it a good family entertainer. Also adding a villain track into it makes the plot convulted. The good thing is the german shepherd wins our hearts. If disney would have made this film, then the tone would have been much lighter."
" Great dog movie!
",0.6588,0.9601,2019-07-15 00:00:00,9,"I'm a sucker for a good animal movie. And this one fits the bill perfectly. Just the right amount of human/animal interaction, family values and situational believability. Didn't dip into the cheese factor too much either. And the star, Max, holds his own amongst the legacy of animal stars of the past. Add a decent supporting cast (Thomas Haden Church and Lauren Graham, whom have a proven track record) as well as the actor who plays the younger brother, and the patriotism undercurrent, produced a very watchable movie. The kind whose pace, makes you not even think about the running time. Enjoy!"
" 10/10 make more movies like this agains

" I JUST HANDLE THE DOG
",0.0,-0.8442,2019-05-18 00:00:00,7,"Kyle (Robbie Amell) is a Marine dog handler in Afghanistan. Following his death, through a series of improbable events, Kyle's brother Justin (Josh Wiggins) gets to keep the dog that only likes him. Justin's father (Thomas Haden Church) is a hard-nose man. Carmen (Mia Xitlali) is the new girl in town who knows something about dogs. Tyler (Luke Kleintank) is a war buddy of Kyle who is not on the up and up.The plot is simple, straight forward, and improbable. It is a family film about a boy and his dog. No Old Yeller endings. Film has some ""intense"" scenes involving fighting, killing, and dog fights...otherwise a great film for the family."
" A true heart warmer.
",0.6124,0.984,2018-01-29 00:00:00,9,"This movie is just simply awesome. Whether you're a kid or an adult, this movie is fantastic. It's not the typical sunshine and rainbows kids' movie you typically see. The film actually portrays some of the struggles we can face early on in life and how that some problems that may seem impossible can become very real. This movie is about a dog but it's also about a teenager who's finding the courage to face the problems he has and to move out of his comfort zone with the help of a dog named Max who is simply a hero to his family and his friends. If you ever dealt with very real issues at a young age or you love a plot you don't typically see, you're going to love this one. This is not a cheesy movie. It's very legit and original. Don't let Metascore or whatever stupid company sway your opinion."
" Military dogs that return from duty are treated more like damaged weapons than damaged soldiers.
",-0.7735,0.5122,2017-08-06 00:00:00,5,"Max is a must-see film for animal lovers. More so, it's a must-see movie for those who are oblivious to how poorly animals are treated in the US. Max is based on a true story about a Belgian Malinois used in military operations in Afghanistan. His handler, Kyle Wilcott (Robbie Arnell) is killed in action, and Max is sent back home. Much like humans, dogs experience post traumatic stress disorder; so upon his return Max is very irritable and unapproachable. Unfortunately, dogs that return in this state are treated no differently than a piece of equipment that returns damagedâ€”they are discarded. This awful act is one of the messages this movie tries to convey. How can a dog be treated like a tank or a gun? Do tanks and arms undergo PTSD? So how can dogs be associated more with the equipment than the solders that return? Kyle's father Ray (Thomas Haden Church) is a veteran who sympathizes with the military trained dogs, and offers to take Max into his home; both as a rescue and as a responsibility to give to his younger son Justin (Josh Wiggins) who is in need of some discipline. The only time Max is calm is in Justin's presenceâ€”Max senses the relationship to Kyle. Justin's best friend is Chuy (Dejon LaQuake) Chuy has a cousin Carmen (Mia Xitali) staying with him. Carmen is familiar with dog rescues, and helps Justin to train Max. We see that Max is a good judge of character, lashing out at anyone evil while being calmer to good-natured people. Max's relentless ferocity to bad people causes problems. Josh finds himself at the wrong place at the wrong time with the overzealous Max, and they get involved in some shady business between Tyler (Luke Kleintank), Kyle's partner in the military, and Emilio (Joseph Julian Soria) a thuggish relative of Chuy. The movie itself was an OK action adventure, but the movie was more about the message. Hopefully after seeing this film people will realize a dog more like a sergeant than an AK-47."
" convoluted story
",0.0,-0.8946,2017-05-17 00:00:00,5,"Kyle Wincott (Robbie Amell) and his dog Max are hunting for weapons in Afganistan. His superiors suspect some of the confiscated weapons have gone missing. Kyle's younger brother Justin is a disappointment to their father Ray (Thomas Haden Church). Pamela (Lauren Graham) is their loving mother. When Kyle is killed, Max is devastated and becomes uncontrollable. Max is taken to Justin during the funeral and Justin adopts him. Justin's friend Chuy's cousin Carmen helps him train Max. Chuy's other cousin Emilio is a drug dealer. Kyle's suspicious comrade Tyler Harne comes to visit and Max is not happy.The plot is more convoluted than necessary. Max as a war dog should be enough to make a tear jerker. Instead, this is overloaded with convenient bad guys with an interconnected villainous plot. A simpler villain for Justin and Max to tackle would have made this infinitely more compelling. I don't find anybody overly objectionable. It is the story that needs some cleaning up. Also, I was hoping the Mexican kids could buck the stereotype but they end up having a drug dealing cousin. A feel-good old fashion war dog movie could be good family fun but this keeps going off track."
" Good story, irritating characters
",-0.0258,-0.8888,2017-03-03 00:00:00,4,"Storyline good, but portrayal of Texans detracted from the movie and made it quite comical. I'm surprised everyone didn't ride around on horses carrying a rifle on their back shooting all the ""Mexicans"" because we are all apparently racist towards hispanics. The young kid wears a shirt that says ""'Murica"". They all talk slow; the neighbor yells he is going to shoot the dog with his '45. The dad comments about guns at the beginning of the show and just pulls a gun out mid-show (don't want to say too much). The Hispanics are represented as ""surprisingly normal"" as if to surprise all the racist white people in Texas. I was so insulted by all of the ridiculous portrayals, it was hard to enjoy an otherwise great storyline and family movie. My husband and I actually made a game of what stereotypical thing would be said or implied next. I can't tell you how many times we nailed it or I would say too much. Also, the kids are wearing hoodies and a redneck fur hat in what is supposedly July in Texas. Really? Have any of these people ever been to Texas?"
