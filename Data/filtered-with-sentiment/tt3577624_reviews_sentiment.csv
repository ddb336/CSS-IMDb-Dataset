" A perfect movie
",0.5719,0.9537,2021-03-18 00:00:00,10,"One of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, very touching makes you cry and laugh at the same moment. A beautiful story and an amazing output... I really enjoyed it."
" A bad episode of ""the crystal maze""
",-0.5423,0.9648,2020-12-22 00:00:00,2,"I am pretty sure I don't like watching paint dry, but I don't know for sure because I have never done it. However I am pretty sure it would be better then watching this film. Took me three goes to finish.. at least when paint dries you have the satisfying feeling of a job well done : )The good:
B Del Toro: I mean... the guy just has great screen presence, he is the main reason I watched the film, but even his acting was just him on an average day. I didn't get the feeling he was making any particular effort; perhaps he thought shooting this film would be more fun then sitting around at home waiting for his new paint job to dry :oTim Robbins. I really like Tim Robbins, but in fact putting him in the ""good"" category shows how poor this film is. He has a few lines that turned my frown up side down for a few seconds, a brief reprieve, and that about all I have on him.The bad:
The story: a bunch of aid workers who go around with no tools, supplies, or any other useful equipment and with no wit or ingenuity - and definitely no rope - try to solve how to get a dead fat guy out of a well. And also the locals are either too stupid to help or just don't care enough to survive? Give me 3-4 volunteers and I'd have the fat dude out within half an hour...The point: Is this a comedy?, is this a story about the tragedy of pointless war? is this about the UN sitting on the thumbs? - it achieves none of these things. Its simply not funny and it does not come across as tragic, you don't get attached to any characters. The boy just mopes around and every other local is portrayed as a git.Olga Kurylenko: How this woman is an actor is beyond me. Her acting can be summed up as: ""looking up and sideways at people with a superior smile on her face"". Also... what is the purpose of her character except to extend the film by half an hour of pointless none-romance with BD Toro. She did give some killer sideways looks with smile though....Mélanie Thierry's character. I like Mélanie Thierry in some things, but in this film they have made her the stereo typical female: week, jumpy with no clue and needs help each step of the way. She was meant to be an expert on water and sanitation, she could have shined at least in that regard, but her only purpose appears to have been to tell then they have a 24 hour deadline to get the body out.The UN... ok seriously, they would cut the rope with the guy half way out of the well? - you'd have to be a real a-hole to do that, the UN troops are not lobotomised robots ffs. I feel 99% sure they would have seen the sit-rep, given a hand, and then maybe given them ""no more"" and ""get lost"" afterwards... right? - anyone from the UN?The music: sooooo, if this was rock concert, great! 10/10... but no, this is a comedy... wait, a tragedy...no, a bad episode of crystal maze? - actually that probably fits this film the best, and you just know they aren't getting out with the crystal.Now I think of it, I was going to give this a 3, but now I have talked myself into giving it a 2."
" Wonderful, brilliant, funny, sad, and uplifting. Excellent!
",0.906,0.979,2020-09-25 00:00:00,10,"A Perfect Day is a brilliant film that depicts the hard situation in post-war Bosnia-Herzegovina. The direction (Fernando León de Aranoa, olé) is excellent, the cast (Benicio del Toro, Tim Robbins, Mélanie Thierry, Eldar Residovic (the little boy), Feda Stukan and Olga Kurylenko) is awesome, the music is really cool, and the script is brilliant. You can feel the devastation of the war without having to see blood all over. This is a film that will make you laugh, that will make you feel sad, froustrated, and uplifted too. One of my favorite films of Fernando León, and one of my favorite films! 10/10

Charming, except for the bitter ex at odds, and it sounded unnecessary... The pains of war with a non-governmental and anti-war outfit... Excellent..."
" 50/50
",0.0,0.6497,2020-08-25 00:00:00,6,"Good script. Ex performances. Funny in parts, sobering in others. Gets a little superficial and overindulgent with the soundtrack although ex songs feels a bit over the top in places and tonally off.It runs out of steam around an hour in and becomes slow and a little harder going. The relationship chat was boring and brought things to a halt.The whole things comes to a philosophical conclusion and everyone became a little closer with the experiences shared but it didt really pay off as i'd hoped."
" Most enjoyable film in a long time!
",0.54,0.9842,2020-08-17 00:00:00,8,"I haven't seen such a decent film in a long time - first I was happy to watch a war-time film that is not about the eternal WWII or Vietnam but about a war that has been overlooked by the film industry even though it's happened right under our nose. I am living in a neighbour country (Romania) and I can testify it's so real as if it was a documentary. When I said ""decent"" I meant the deep respect for the athmosphere, of the people living in that area, depicting them exactly how they are, presenting their lives in such terrible times, the destruction and on the other hand the difficulties the foreigners have had in understanding the psychology of the locals, the uselessness of the UN forces, the shortages and many other aspects very authentically depicted. I liked how the locals are depicted as witty, loving a good laugh over anything and in any circumstances - this really is a characteristic of people in the Balkans and it takes a fine mind to emphasize it! Characters are priceless, witty, dialogues savory, humour is used just to enlighten an otherwise heavy topic and to give characters spiciness. Great acting, well done Benicio Del Toro, well done Tim Robbins and the whole team!"
" You might want to sign up after meeting these characters
",0.0772,0.0112,2020-07-04 00:00:00,8,"This is a study on humanity at its best when humanity is at its worst. I wanted to jump into the screen to help, to take part in the bonds we see built between this small group of people. It's the very definition of being drawn into a story. As the characters work and also spend downtime together it's easy to forget for a moment that they're in a war zone. I found that fact shadowing every pause, looming around the corner of every moment like the landmines hidden beneath the surface. My only criticism is what I found to be a disjointed soundtrack. Except for the final movement leading to a wonderfully ironic ending, the songs playing over the scenes were distracting and took a little away from the otherwise perfect movie making. Most of the violence in the movie is shown as aftermath or as the aforementioned threat. However, there is very tense scene where the weapon involved is a simple rock. It was just as engaging as any shoot-em-up war movie, and perfectly fit a great story about some people trying get hold of a simple piece of rope."

" Enough Rope!
",0.0,0.9941,2019-11-07 00:00:00,8,"A Perfect Day is an original and unexpected great little anti-war film which cleverly gets its message across about the utter futility of war and its typical outcomes of extensive collateral damage to civilians, without a shot being fired in anger. I use the term ""little"" not to be condescending, but to emphasise this is no big Hollywood project. Rather it's a Spanish production in which English is the most frequently heard of a number of languages in the movie.Director/writer Fernando León de Aranoa has astutely selected an internationally representative band of well-known actors for his very believable story of a group of 5 aid workers trying to do their jobs to the best of their abilities, towards the end of the mid 1990's Balkan conflict. At every turn they find roadblocks thrown up to stymie their efforts, not just literally by vying militia groups, but metaphorically by UN peace-keepers and their over-seeing bureaucracy who are supposed to be supporting them and various civilian ethnic groups, members of whom, the aid workers are trying to help.The film was largely shot on location and the selected Spanish settings double for the Balkans seamlessly. Besides that, the producers seem to have had little trouble finding a large group of Serbio-Croat actors to constitute much of the support cast.It's really enjoyable watching Benicio Del Toro not playing a ""heavy"" type character for a change. He is excellent as the ""seen everything war has to offer"" group leader Mambru. Great to see Tim Robbins back playing Mambru's experienced off-sider B, who's always the quickest to see the humour in just about any situation, no matter how dire. Mélanie Thierry presence is very welcome as a new French recruit to the NGO team who is unused to the harsh realities she may have to face when entering a war zone. Olga Kurylenko adds plenty of spunk and verve whilst playing a supervisor in the NGO, who is both getting a lift with the team, whilst being an old flame of Mambru's. Rounding out the quintet of leads is Bosnian actor Fedja Stukan who is prominent as the team's translator.The perfect day of the title is actually about a day and half in the movie, as the aid team repeatedly try to retrieve a corpse from a well somewhere in the former Yugoslavia to assist the rag tag group of locals in having access to hopefully unpolluted water. The situations they are forced to endure, as well as the problems they have to collectively solve make both suspenseful and realistic viewing and are always entertaining. The beauty of the film, besides that of the stunning location cinematography, graphic in nature, is the comic and self-deprecating humour which enriches much of the film's dialogue. This is not a MASH, nor is it trying to be. But A Perfect Day realises that for many of these aid workers to keep operating in extremely stressful settings, requires them to not try to suppress their senses of humour.In fact the film, which by the way has a fine soundtrack, has a wickedly ironic twist ending which rounds everything off on a very darkly funny note. A Perfect Day may not make perfect viewing for everybody, but it is undoubtedly of a fine calibre and thoroughly recommended."
" A Near-Perfect Movie
",0.0,0.8901,2019-10-25 00:00:00,8,"(Slight Spoilers)There are so few movies about humanitarian workers out there, and even fewer that are a combination drama/comedy. Which makes ""A Perfect Day"" probably unique. Even better, it is a good movie.The fictitious aid agency Aid Across Borders could easily be a stand-in for real agencies such as Doctors Without Borders or some other similar NGO. The characters played by Benicio del Toro, Tim Robbins, Melanie Thierry, and Olga Kurylenko can also easily be based on an amalgam of real-life aid workers. So kudos to the writers for having had done their homework.The situations these characters find themselves in during the course of actually two days in Yugoslavia towards the end of the civil war there are entirely believable. In a conflict zone, a lot of crazy things can and do happen. In this case, it is a mission to find some rope to take out a corpse that had been thrown into a well, whose water local villagers badly need.That's right, a piece of rope. It is both banal and realistic at the same time, which is why it is equally comical and farcical. The reactions and actions of the characters during the course of this mission define what it is like to be a humanitarian aid worker - some are idealistic, some are practical, some are bureaucratic, but many do want to do the right thing.Thankfully, there is not much proselytizing about the evils of war or over-the-top painting of aid workers as naive do-gooders or saints. The movie simply shows what it is like, and that is much more powerful. There are a few outstanding scenes throughout, which are quite tense and realistic. There are also a few unrealistic moments, but they are not detract much from the overall story-telling.So do they succeed in the end? You have to watch the movie to find out. :)"
" The location of the film was beautiful but that was about all I liked
",0.7311,-0.7469,2019-08-24 00:00:00,4,The film was slow and pointless. I fell asleep about 20 min in the movie and woke up with about 30 minutes left. I could not watch this movie for the life of me because there was no point of the movie. There was no plot other than some well that they were trying to get a dead body out of. Whoever made this movie was thinking they could get two academy award winners and that's going to prop the movie up for the whole 1 1/2 hours of movie time but it didn't. Tim Robbins is a has been and same with the other actor. They were great in the past but this was just sad and pathetic on all fronts. Why did they choose this movie? I have no idea.
" They must have been drunk in Cannes.
",-0.34,-0.9486,2019-07-19 00:00:00,2,"Apparently, this piece of garbage received a 10 minute standing ovation at Cannes, and in other festivals this was praised to dead. I have to ask, we watched the same movie? If not, i'm pretty sure they were over generous with this.
The plot of the movie is the most simplistic thing ever: some aid workers search for a rope to remove a corpse of a well, they fail, accomplishing nothing. I don't have a problem with a simple story, I love movies like Jeanne Dielman, where nothing happens. But for that, the characters have to be interesting, or the cinematography beautiful, or something has to be special, for the movie to not be painful to watch. This thing fails in every single aspect, everything is boring.
We don't care about the characters, maybe a little bit for the kid, only because is a kid and for some forced plot device involving him. Everyone else, or is an a**hole or is stupid. Benicio del Toro kind of tries, but even a great actor can do nothing if you give him nothing to work. The two girls can't act, I haven't seen them in other projects, so i'm not sure if it's their fault or of the director and writters. Tim Robbins has two or three funny lines, and that's it.
The cinematography is really bad. There were some moments nears the ending, where the camera was extremely out of focus, that it seemed like a five year old was behind it.
For me, the music is easily the worst aspect. I'm not saying the music is bad, the Velvet Underground i my 3rd favourite band and Lou Reed one of my favourite solo artists of all time. Then, why i'm saying is bad? Tell me, Venus in Furs fits with some people driving in the night? Or, Marilyn Manson's cover of Sweet Dreams fits with some people searching for a ball? Of course not. That's the problem, every musical choice here is totally out of place.
I'm sure that critics and audiences loved this movie just for one reason: the portrayal of the war and the peace protocols. It's a different take for sure, bur it's not interesting.
I would not recommend this even to my worst enemy, please save you an hour and a half of your life."
" So Depressing
",-0.4391,0.2374,2019-02-03 00:00:00,5,"It seems that cr*ph*le countries include half of Europe. The UN is a useless bureaucracy which only increases suffering. This movie has a lot going for it - the excellent acting. The story itself just makes you want to throw yourself off of a cliff. The acting and characters are very good, but forcing yourself to watch it is like trying to kill yourself with a tack hammer. If you're brave or self-hating, go ahead and watch this."

",-0.25,-0.2732,2018-12-04 00:00:00,1,My review of this movie: Lets get kids to bug friends computers because EVERYONE is a terrorist. ALL this movie is doing is promoting the stereo type propaganda we hear every day.
" Stupid Movie
",-0.5267,-0.25,2018-11-18 00:00:00,3,"Plot makes very little sense. They keep looking for a rope in a war torn Serbia, one could simply fashion one out of trees or electrical wires.
Benicio & Tim Robbins are good actors and have a presence but movie leverages too much on that, very little on screenplay."
" Fresh
",0.3182,-0.34,2018-11-07 00:00:00,9,A cohen-esque take on war and the aid workers that survive it. Tim Robbins and Benecio Del Toro absolutely deliver in this movie. The big plus is it's like nothing else out there.
" ""Oh, it's such a perfect day,I'm glad I spent it with you,Oh, such a perfect day,You just keep me hanging on.""
",0.886,0.8932,2018-09-17 00:00:00,9,"Recently viewing the magnificent El incidente (2014)/ The Incident, I decided it was time to finally see the films on Netflix I've been most interested in watching. Taken by the trailer a few weeks ago,I decided it was at last time to find out how perfect this day could be.View on the film:Remarkably having the Granada, Malaga and Cuenca locations in Spain stand in for the Balkans, the rugged terrain tightly captures the rough-edge atmosphere of co-writer/(with Paula Farias) director Fernando León de Aranoa's adaptation of Farias's novella Dejarse llover. Taking place at the end of the Yugoslav Wars, the writers intelligently use earthy humour to bring a touch of warmth to the grim setting, from the bickering on the radio between Mambrú and ""B"", to Mambrú's attempts to build a bond with a boy in the war zone. Travelling round before the UN peace troops arrive, the writers give the film a road movie rhythm, as the aid workers travel round various bombed-out villages and bureaucratic dead-ends to try and help the surviving locals, whilst the friendships in their team tighten.Backed by ill-fitting Rock songs, director Aranoa & cinematographer Alex Catalán sweep along the landscape in vast crane shots that view from the horizon the aftermath of war. Landing on earth with a corpse in a well and a mass suicide in a back garden,Aranoa grates a raw, grubby atmosphere, with the aid workers and the survivors having to pull what little remains of their livelihoods out of the ground. Joined by a gruff Tim Robbins as ""T"" and a heart-felt Olga Kurylenko as Katya,Benicio Del Toro gives an outstanding performance as Mambrú, with Del Toro bringing extra weight to the horrific situations with a thick gravitas and heaviness over this less than perfect day."
" Ironic Humor with anti-war genre
",0.1531,0.7891,2018-09-01 00:00:00,7,"The film by Fernando León de Aranoa has a special aura that comes from a script that is quite original, but which does not reach what is proposed.
With a sarcastic and at the same time dramatic style, the film does not work completely, there are only scenes in the head.
What perhaps I would squeak is the soundtrack (Rock) that break with the silence that should accompany an anti-war film, and that works as a transition in the aforementioned scenes.
Personally, the ironic humor I like a lot and sticks with the personality of the protagonists but it is well mixed. It's a bit sad, because the performances of the cast are very good and it shows a palpable chemistry."
" The film brilliantly captures the absurdities of war and complexities of NGO work!
",0.1007,-0.1531,2018-04-16 00:00:00,8,"Anyone with interest in either the Yugoslav civil war or aid work in conflict zones will find the movie insightful. The movie brings together a diverse set of characters interacting during the course of one day. These individuals are not only aid workers, including two women - one a newbie and another straight from the city and 'civilization' struggling to adapt to the realities found in a war zone - but also two locals, i.e. a local child and an interpreter. The plot revolves around aid workers attempting to restore water supply to local villagers from a contaminated well. What appears to be a simple exercise becomes at times dangerous and at other times frustrating due to the behavior of bureaucratic 'do-gooders' UN peacekeepers. Many may dispute my '8' rating given that at times the movie moves slowly as there is little action . However, the film is peppered with humor - lightening the heavy nature of the subject - and makes a strong political statement. Those factors pushed the rating up."
" Slow but...
",0.0,0.9723,2018-04-01 00:00:00,8,This is the beauty of it. For a long time I have given up on American entertainment. Living in the US one gets constantly inundated with mindless entertainment. European movies are in general slow. They give much more time to develop the characters and thus allow the story to sink in. A Perfect Day is a great movie that shows the cultural differences and people from different countries tries working together for a common goal. It also shows the ineptness of the UN which is true all over the world.where ever they are asked to intervene. Great movie.
" A perfect analogue to Postlewaite and Caine's Emergency Sex
",0.2732,0.4852,2018-03-27 00:00:00,8,"An under-appreciated and under-read non-fiction account of NGO aid workers throwing themselves into - and becoming addicted to - the most desperate world humanitarian crises, the novel Emergency Sex (and other Desperate Measures) has moved me since first discovering it at a bookshop in Kenyatta Airport, Nairobi. This movie nails the emotion, the frustration, the passion, the resignation and the endurance of some of our worlds' most unheralded heroes. A strong recommend."
" An Imperfect Day

" Easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
",-0.4019,-0.9933,2018-02-28 00:00:00,1,"**SPOILERS because I want to save you from wasting your time with this movie!**When the movie started, I saw the IFC logo and an alarm went off in my head but I couldn't remember why. I would later find out that it was because this film embodies the worst in independent movies.The plot of this movie can be accurately summed up in two sentences: A group of aid workers drive around Yugoslavia looking for rope to fish a corpse out of a well. They fail. The end.What makes the movie awful is that it lacks anything to make it interesting besides the scenery and Tim Robbins' character having a few good lines. There is in character development, no message, no conflict, and no resolution. It just literally goes nowhere; I'm sure there are some lame film snobs who think this makes the movie ""unique"" or whatever but for the majority of people who watch movies to be told a story or be entertained it not only falls short but doesn't even try. The whole movie is just the cast driving around asking random Bosnians for rope and and getting denied at every turn for no reason. Throughout the movie they are paranoid about landmines and RPGs but I didn't hear a single explosion in the entire movie so it made the cast seem paranoid while breaking my suspension of disbelief.The writers in this movie definitely seem to have some sort of anti-UN agenda for whatever reason as evidenced by the movies bad ending where the UN literally sends an army of men with automatic weapons and tanks to stop the cast from removing the corpse from the well for some made up reason that really just seemed like bad writing to give the movie an unhappy ending just for the sake of having an unhappy ending in a lamely transparent attempt to make the film seem more ""indie"" or something. Independent movies with sad endings can still be really good (an excellent example of this is Donnie Darko) but with this movie it just made seem like over an hour and a half of frustration with no payoff. Watching this movie made me feel like I sat in traffic for over an hour and half to get somewhere only to find the place was closed and I sat in all that traffic for nothing.After the great army of the UN succeeds in their super-important mission to keep a corpse in a well they order the cast to clean the overflowing latrines in the overcrowded refugee camp, a task that should been reserved for whomever wrote this movie.Don't waste your time with this pile of garbage, you will regret it."

But A Perfect Day exemplifies this better than any other film I've seen.The premise is simple...a group of Aid workers in the Balkan war in the 1990's are charged with removing a corpse from a village well before it poisons the village water supply (the ugly reason that it was placed in there in the first place). During initial efforts, their rope breaks. The bulk of the rest of the movie is the simple premise of these people trying to find a new rope in a war zone, and the ridiculous bureaucracy and brutality that they encounter during this basic task.The films ending is absolutely beautiful, backed by Marlene Dietrich's version of 'Where Have All the Flowers Gone'.The cinematography is beautiful, and the acting is superb...Benicio Del Toro and Tim Robbins lead the way, but also a sleeper performance by Melanie Thierry.Make the time to see this film...you will NOT be disappointed."

" running in a circle
",0.0,0.8182,2017-08-06 00:00:00,8,"Mambrú (Benicio Del Toro) is the world-weary leader of a group from 'Aid Across Borders' trying to help sanitation in the war-torn Balkans. He reconnects with his conflict-evaluater ex Katya (Olga Kurylenko). He deals with UN bureaucracy, problematic locals, and a body stuck in a well. The irreverent B (Tim Robbins) and translator Damir (Fedja Stukan) go off in search of rope to pull out the body. The idealistic newcomer Sophie (Mélanie Thierry) is exasperated. There's the boy looking a ball. It's a day in the life.I like that this takes this serious world and use a small part to run the plot through. It's like a little hamster running around in a wheel. There is a bit of humor and plenty of poignant sadness. It's a little slow at times but it never lets go. It's great that it gets tied together in the end."

Although the circumstances the characters are in are painful when you think about it, the movie still manages to fill your heart with hope and warmth because it shows you no matter how hard the situation may get, people always adjust and find a way to cope with it with their inherent survival instinct. The movie shows that even in the amid of war, tears, losses, people still can find joy of life even with a small ball or a simple rope, or simply guessing which way to go if you come across a dead cow in the middle of the road. The acting was balanced and not overdone. Usually, in movies with Benicio Del Torro, it is hard to outshine him, but Tim Robbins also gives an equally great performance. It is always hard to finish a war movie with a smile on your face. Yet, this movie makes you think, makes you question, and makes you smile. Kudos to Fernando León de Aranoa. Good job."
