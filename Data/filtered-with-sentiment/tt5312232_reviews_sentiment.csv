" Practical Indian love story
",0.6369,0.7136,2020-06-07 00:00:00,8,"Everything in this movie is realistic. Not like many of typical south movies .This movie emphasis on the caste system, how difficult it is to live without income, how our lives change drastically after eloping. Many South movies depict non viable realty. But this film is different.Watch it if you want to experience how love stories work out."

" Emotional
",0.1531,0.8577,2019-06-13 00:00:00,10,I like this movie but yeah I thought there is no need for the friends of the couple to ask for a lift in midnight when they are trying to escape so that the police wouldn't have caught them and archi shouldn't have given her address to her mother where they live if she really miss her mom it could have been better by just keeping contact through phone
" Great watch
",0.6249,0.8042,2019-04-20 00:00:00,9,"Starts off like the typical Bollywood movie, but is everything but. Thoroughly enjoyable, particularly the last half where it's more about real life and taking off the rose tinted glasses. Gives you a glimpse into the realities some must face living in such a society where older traditions/systems prevail. A recommended watch."
" Greatest Marathi Movie Ever Made

" Overrated.
",0.0,0.9849,2018-09-16 00:00:00,3,"The acting is great.
The music is good.
The screenplay is meh.
But there is nothing that makes this film any different from the hoards of films on inter caste marriages that have/ have not worked in film stories. Sometimes it takes some gimmick to make a film run. This probably did the same.The bold character of the girl is shown as a base of her characteristics but is of no use anywhere in the film. The falling in love is more of an infatuation than a special spark between them. College going kids fall in love and run away while the girl's side hunt them. this happens in every socially uneven characters' love stories.It is evident that good stories are ignored and movies that repeat the same basic structure of romance (The 'Qayamat Se Qayamt Tak' kind) run well at the box office.Such a shame that so many are blind."

" Best Romantic genre movie of Indian Cinema
",0.7845,0.9952,2018-08-28 00:00:00,9,"Sairaat, a movie of romantic genre, is an ordinary story of a couple fighting from casteism in India, but with a different presentation. Movie starts off good, giving time to build character of Parshya in first 20 minutes. Ample time is given thereafter building the character of Archie and their romantic relationship. Hence, at any point of time in movie, you don't feel disconnected or missing something. 
 The Best thing about this movie is the Acting of main characters, direction and Music. The plot and background seems so realistic as compared to rural India, giving an essence of the casteism issues going to arise later in the movie. The actual Description of slums in second half of movie is the best any director can achieve. Rinku Rajguru got the best actress award for her role of Archie. Music of the movie is yet another aspect to praise for. The romatic relationship between Archie and Parshya is best accompanied by Intense music given by Ajay-Atul.
 Though the movie is gripping in overall, there is a time in second half when things start becoming very predictable, and you start losing interest in this 'cliche' story. But then, the director comes up with his masterstroke ending. The movie ends at a place, which is really unpredictable, and leaves the audience in an emotional trauma. The ending of movie in itself raises a question, and highlights another major social issue prevalent in India. Overall, one must watch this movie once, it is totally worth it, considering many aspects which the movie excels at."
" Great Movie!
",0.6588,0.9724,2018-08-23 00:00:00,9,"1. Such a wonderfully effective Storytelling!! 
Scripting!! 
Narating!! 
Shot Divisions!!
Director, Script writer knows his job!!2. ""Sairat Zala ji"" is the BEST tune in last few years!! Unbelievably Great Melody!! How could such a soothing melody could be composed!! Wonderfully sung. 
Hats off the Music Directors: Ajay-Atul and Singers. 3. Don't understand a word of Marathi but enjoyed so much! Truly global Cinema!"
" Sairat: A tell-tale of love that could overcome almost anything...almost!
",0.6696,0.8886,2018-08-12 00:00:00,9,"This movie tells about a love that knew no boundaries. A gripping story that shows that love is not a passing fancy or a fleeting emotion, rather it is a chore that doesn't end with being the person one loves. 
The movie has beautifully captured the essence of that first innocent love that is pure. We see how the twist and turns of life slowly starts to corrode that love. And we learn a that being a lover/ a partner isn't easy but the idea is to never give up. The end is totally unexpected and horrifying, and yet that is the sad truth of our society. 
Overall, an awesome movie with a realistic portrayal in today's modern times."
" Conveys the sad reality of honor killings!
",-0.69,0.9621,2018-08-04 00:00:00,7,"Well before discussing other things, I would like to say something about this movie. The movie name is 'sairat'. It has songs like 'yed laglaay' and 'Zingat'. I am a non-maharashtrian, despite that I got to understand the movie. The movie went hit but meaning of Sairat and Zingat were still unknown to me. After researching I settled Sairat for 'Ranti' (wild) and Zingat for 'stoned'. Tone, Script & Story: The story is about honor killings that happen if people with different category or caste get involved as they love each other. Yes this happens in India. Although such a thing is not that prominent with marathi's.It's sad to see the fate but till then it's an incredible ride. I mean main leads along with their family and friends. For example a guy falls for a piece of paper thrown by lady, to be a love letter.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: It's a local movie with related surroundings. Whatever we are presented with is justified. Music: 'Zingat' is super hit. 'Yed laglay' is hit as well. Acting: To see the associated actors act with their roles was a treat.Final Verdict: What is conveyed is sad. The movie is scripted and pictured really well. It conveys the sad reality of honor killings."
" SAIRAT, one of the finest movie I ever seen
",0.0,0.8622,2018-08-02 00:00:00,10,"SAIRAT, one of the finest movie I ever seen. Screenplay, Cinematography, Casting, Music, Story everything is perfect. One of the finest direction of all time. Now I am fan of Marathi cinema. Very natural and realistic, never felt these actors are complete new comers. Presentation of last scene was unbelievable."
" A Movie that will be remembered forever
",0.0,0.9694,2018-07-26 00:00:00,10,This movie have made a history that no movie will be ever able to make it. No one will be able to make such a great movie ever. One of the great movie ever made in India. Great performance by Rinku Rajguru and Akash Thosar. Best direction by Nagraj Manjule. It's the movie every Indian should be proud of and it should be watched by every Indian all over the world. Great movie.
" I'm not worthy to write a review for this movie
",-0.3412,0.9955,2018-07-23 00:00:00,10,"I guess i'm not worthy enough to write a review for this movie. But lemme still try. I loved this movie from the first scene to the last Background score while the film credits were running on the screening. A simple movie, with a gripping screenplay, wonderful direction and fantastic acting. lead actress was way above anything. The guy also did a fantastic job. 
If you ever have been in love then the first half of the movie will feel like you are living your first love and experiencing it once again. I have myself fell in love with a girl from a different caste and faced a little of the insults compared to the these people in the movie. I know people in india are so crazy about caste that im sure people would have searched for the caste of the lead actor and actress. The film is an experience and also a lesson. on how to love, on how to stick to one person after you love, how to feel each other's pain, how to come over little obstacles in a relationship when you are in trouble. it is surely a 'till death do us apart' kind of a movie. I watched the movie all over again only for writing the review. In a movie there are few iconic scenes. I love the scenes where the girl saves the guy multiple times- be it in college where he was manhandled by her cousin, shoots her own relative when he was seriously about to get killed may be. 
Its a wonderful wonderful movie. The direction is top notch. and I have no reason why one should take away even one star from this master piece. This is a director's movie and if you haven't watched this and didn't like this movie you either have never loved anyone or you are a freaking caste fanatic."
" Good movie !
",0.4926,-0.4574,2018-07-21 00:00:00,7,The climax of the movie was shocking ! It just gave me goosebumps as it was completely unexpected
" Brilliant
",0.5859,0.9512,2018-07-14 00:00:00,10,I never feel such sadness what I feel after watching this movie. The mentality of our society is so disgraceful. The portrait of Archie and Prashant is so so good. I love both characters and I recommend to all of you who are bit emotional like me should watch this movie I can guarantee that after watching this movie they have some tears in their eyes.
" Hat's Off... What a Film . Actors,Direction , screenplay..superb
",0.0,0.6948,2018-07-09 00:00:00,10,"I'm from hyderabad, i never thought i'll see any marathi film.. my friend suggested to watch this epic... i saw and i'll never forget this film..actors were too much extraordinary.. girl was full to kiraak..!!!"
" A realistic, captivating film told in such a simple movie
",0.0,0.9716,2018-07-02 00:00:00,8,"I decided to watch this movie before watching Dhadak (it's Hindi remake) as I had heard so many good things about it. I had never watched a Marathi film before, but it was on Netflix, so easily accessible.The beginning goes like your normal Bollywood story. Poor guy meets rich girl, rich girl meets poor guy. Guy is aggressively staring at girl (which is always creepy, but it's a Bollywood norm), girl eventually reciprocates. But of course family drama gets in the way and they run away. Again, it seemed like a story you've seen before.However, the characters themselves are so interesting. The guy is a shy dude who isn't truly able to defend himself, but the girl is an assertive woman who defends her feelings for the guy and even stands up for him with her family. Eventually they have to run away and this is the part of the story that is just so realistic and captivating.The writer/director did not let them running away be the end of the story. He showcases the real struggles the couple face and how realistic it would be for a girl from a higher class family and a boy from a lower class family to face the world. At this point, I had a hard time leaving the screen as the story just pulled me in to see if these kids (which they really were) would make it. I would highly recommend watching this movie before the Bollywood version. I love Karan Johar, but this version of the story reflects a much more real tone I feel than his (although fun and wonderful) normal tone in movies. I'm afraid of the movie losing it's realness.9/10 definitely recommend. Only did not agree with the starting tones of the movie with their courtship, even though it needed to be quick for the story."
" More than An Epic Love Story
",0.6369,0.8439,2017-12-24 00:00:00,10,"This is movie you have been waiting for to watch all Friday. This is the movie. Romance. Social Phenomenon. And Action. It has everything.Like they say, Shakespearean ending! I just love this movie."
" Tried to create a good movie but.... Disappointed
",0.2263,-0.8431,2017-11-20 00:00:00,1,"Pathetic movie some time the director and writers or the whole movie fraternity don't know the essence. I hope this type of movies don't ever get made. Really disappointed no emotions at all only cruelty Didn't expect this from Marathi movie This is not expected after movies like Timepass, natsamrat, Me Shivajiraje Bhosale Boltoy, The silence etc..."
" Art at its finest
",0.0,0.9837,2017-10-03 00:00:00,10,"I'm always drawn to honesty. Rawness speaks volumes, and this movie did just that. Almost every actor we see on screen is a new face, picked randomly from among busy crowds. What they have done on screen can barely be called ""acting"" because they were living it. None of the dialogues and their deliverance seemed manufactured or exaggerated. There is no hero-worship, unnecessary dance numbers or unrealistic plots within the film. Director Nagraj has kept everything real. Archi, Parshya, Pradeep, their parents, all of these are real people, set up in a rural backdrop and the film shows us just that. Nothing has been altered to make it ""seemingly tempting"" or ""attractive"".India needs such films today more than it has ever did. We are a young country with an unrivaled youth demographic: 65% of its population is 35 or under, and half the country's population of 1.25 billion people is under 25 years of age. I can safely say that 90% of the commercial movies produced by Bollywood, Tollywood or any other state are love stories. We watch them, enjoy them and come back home to our daughters and sons being denied the freedom to find love in their own lives. This movie asserts how inhumane it is to snatch a person's right to love who they want. India is changing definitely and this movie is going to help a big deal.The lead actors Akash and Rinku have stunned me with their performing skills. This has got to be one of my favorite films hands down."
" The art of storytelling perfected!
",0.6114,0.9871,2017-10-01 00:00:00,10,"The art of storytelling perfected with visual treat of the natural beauty of rural India, topped with an extra dose of realism. This movie is a perfect example that proves – it doesn't take big budget, visual effects, sophisticated CGIs and established actors to make an excellent movie. It narrates a love story that's caught in the unfortunate caste/class feud that still haunts India. The director has used this mundane plot which has been oversold in Indian films in almost all languages, and magically turned it into something unbelievably extraordinary. It's a long movie - about 3 hours, but there's not a single dull moment. The first half is filled with innocent humour the keeps the audience entertained and is followed by captivating stretches of reality. The excellent music and songs just adds value to an already exceptional movie. A must watch Indian classic!"
" Reality bites.
",0.0,0.958,2017-06-29 00:00:00,6,"As someone who does not speak Marathi, this was my first exposure to its cinema. I saw the people behind this movie interviewed on a comedy show and it seemed like it would be worth checking out. Overall it was a decent movie. I think it was a bit too long for the content and message it conveys. There was nothing new really, the same vein as Romeo/Juliet, QSQT, Ishaqzaade and on and on. Hopefully the movie will help many naive couples who are experiencing puppy love during their adolescent years. The patriarchy ingrained in the culture and the antiquated value of viewing women of the family as personal property leads to so called ""honor"" killings. The first half of the movie was way too long, it got better in the 2nd half; the last 15 mins are the best part of the movie. Truly haunting."
" This movie made my day
",0.0,0.8074,2017-04-20 00:00:00,9,"Last night after watching ""Court"" I wanted to try some Marathi movie. I got this from a list. After watching court I expected I would watch some poorly made movie with a good story. But I was wrong. It is not only a good story but also a great made movie. I looking forward to more Marathi title."
" Fine, but not THE BEST
",-0.7154,0.9169,2017-04-02 00:00:00,5,"It is a good movie and made well showing the typical village life and the way things work there. Depiction of caste system, politics, friendship and love stories in school is fine and is a typical kind of a movie. Only thing which made this movie work was the music and only music. All other things in the movie are very typical and nothing new. It is only the Ajay Atul music which made this movie."
" Sairat-One of the Best Love Stories.
",0.8555,0.938,2017-03-14 00:00:00,9,"For me language is not a barrier when watching a film as long as it has English subs. I never watched a Marathi film before watching Sairat and this is no doubt an epic of a love story dealt with perfection. Balancing the social issue like caste system in India and a love story is not an easy task but hats off to Manjule who pulled it off like a pro. Narrating simple stories is the most difficult things and he does it in a poetic way. Full marks to Manjule's narration, Casting, especially the lead actors. Cinematography and Music makes it a treat to watch. Rinku is just awesome, i am spellbound with her performance. Do watch it!"
" And now i am an official fan of Marathi cinema!!
",0.4374,0.9802,2017-01-14 00:00:00,10,"I usually don't watch much Marathi movies, but now I will...The climax left us speechless and movie make us think is it really 21st century?? And sadly...yes, imaginary social stratification is still an issue in India. It is a beautifully woven story with friendship, emotion, love and real life of overlooked India. I am not going to talk about story because it's not about the story, it's about the message film trying to deliver. The story is somewhat predictable at various instances, but it is not a suspense movie, it is a movie which try to show the face of real India to the world. Recently I watched another Marathi movie- Court (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3717068) and I must tell that Marathi movie industry is coming up with bravery to show the reality to the world and not just entertainment. I strongly recommend to watch this movie...it's really outstanding among all the movies being produced in India."
