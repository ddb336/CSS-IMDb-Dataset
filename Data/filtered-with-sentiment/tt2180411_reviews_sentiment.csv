" What the hell happened here
",-0.6808,-0.2023,2021-04-11 00:00:00,6,The first half of this film I enjoyed enough the songs where average but the different fairytales happening and coming together was interesting enough and it felt like the film was going somewhere. Everything is resolved and all the characters lived happily ever after but no we get another hour of giants attacking our characters someone dies and it's just completely glossed over it just ruins the evils film 7/10 first half 3/10 second half.
" For children
",0.0,-0.6634,2021-04-07 00:00:00,7,I think its not a bad adaptation but still it is a not good adaptation an above average we can think. That witch and bakers characters that connected to me apart from them all other characters go in while. Overall a one time watchable.
" Should Have Ended at Happily Ever After!
",0.5983,0.21,2021-03-31 00:00:00,7,"This movie is something of an enigma, but not intentionally so, I think. Its greatest merit is the sense of foreboding from the dark woods; the songs are not particularly good, as my children both commented. The weaving together of Grimm tales is also interesting, but not so clever as to form the basis of a movie. Well, they went with it anyway, and if they tied together fairy-tale favorites in the first part, in the second they unravel them, or at least the premise of a happy ending, when the dead giant's wife attacks in the midst of Cinderella and the Prince's wedding ceremony. Everything from here on out is uneven, sometimes downright bizarre, and sends questionable messages to children (was that really the point?). I'll point to just one: the baker's wife commits adultery (well, a kiss and a fantasy) with Cinderella's prince while they are alone in the woods, and dies soon thereafter. Huh? At least the widowed husband invites the infant child and the rest of the broken fair tale characters, including a motherless Jack and an estranged Cinderella, to live with him in his house. But that's not exactly a happy ending.On a personal note, this was the first movie my daughter saw in the theaters, at about two and a half-years (I know - I think she just thought it was scary). She was sick around Christmas time (2014) and we were staying at a hotel near the mall so that her newborn brother wouldn't get sick as well. She went to sleep about half-way through. Thankfully!"
" 1 star for amazing cast only!
",0.6239,-0.8984,2021-03-20 00:00:00,1,"Hard to believe this many A rated stars (and agents?) hoped to pull this painful repetition of monotone musical drivel wound between your favourite childhood fairytales. A simplified opinion of what's wrong here is; the stories are old and not original even when trying to combine all of them, and the musical ""score"" is a major drawback to this project that is completely brutal to watch, or hear!"
" A criminally boring and nasty little film.
",-0.7096,-0.9905,2021-03-18 00:00:00,2,"This is a dark, nasty little film deceptively marketed as a Disney kids film, it deals callously with death, murder, rape, infidelity and almost all the characters are selfish (in as much as they're fleshed out at all.)All this might make it sound either tantalising or a potential morality tale, or a conversation starter to talk about these issues with children.Unfortunately, its biggest crime is that it's utterly boring so by the time it's finished you won't care, you'll just want to have a shower. As well as unengaging, poorly paced, ugly, needlessly theatrical (this stage musical is unconvincingly transferred to screen) especially in its 2nd half. It's 'dark humour' is woefully misjudged and leaves a sour taste. Maybe Tim Burton could have handled the source material more successfully?Plusses? A funny scene with the two princes and some clever lyrics. I get what it's doing; subversive... retelling... modern... blah blah blah. and I wish it hadn't bothered.I don't have many free afternoons to sit and relax with my 7y.o. daughter - this wasted one of them in the most profound ways and left her bored and me angry. Very much regretted watching it with her. I truly hated this dark, grimy film."
" The problem is the music and songs
",-0.4019,-0.9635,2021-03-13 00:00:00,3,"The fundamental problem with this movie is the music score. It is just very poor, has pathetic songs and melodies, and is completely uninspiring. There are many movie musicals with very second rate music scores, both regular and animated (are you listening Disney?!), and this is one of them. The composer tries hard to please the listener with an original emotionally moving score, but fails miserably. It is just very poor composition. They needed someone like Rogers and Hammerstein or John Williams. (And Johnny Depp is a marvellous actor but he can't sing!) It's a great shame because this movie, its theme, acting, storyline and beautiful set held great promise."

People who are giving negative reviews have never seen an actual theater play! I was lucky enough to be introduced to the theater as a kid at school, and I have always loved going to musical plays. This movie is like a 10 star theater play!! I just love it. It is high quality, you can tell they had high budget. The acting was amazing, all great actors, even the kids were amazing. I don't understand what could warn such low review here!! Its a very well done play."
" Maddeningly monotonous
",0.0,0.9216,2021-02-26 00:00:00,4,"This had so much potential. The sets are amazing, the cast is incredible. The story line is really clever.
That said, the music is maddeningly monotonous. I thought for sure the tone would at least change with different songs. Nope. The score drones on and on in a singsong, one note fashion. It's a rip off of the Belle song in Beauty and the Beast, without any bridge or transition."
" Bad
",-0.5423,-0.3612,2021-02-23 00:00:00,3,I'm going to be as lazy as the director and end my review here.

",0.0,-0.1779,2021-02-13 00:00:00,1,"I thought the movie was going somewhere, when they dropped a bomb shell. Oh brother. It was like the director wanted to go in a certian direction & woke up from his sleep & suddenly took a 360* turn."
" Funny musical with lots of style
",0.4404,0.9889,2021-02-07 00:00:00,7,"Surprised to see so many low reviews here, many stating that they either didn't know it was all a musical or that the plot gets very odd after the first half. I do get the latter point but I also really enjoyed the songs and atmosphere in this film, the acting is solid and the characters good. I think some critics may have gone a bit overboard in their praise, like when the New York Times called it ""this century's best musical"" which I would contest, but is it good? Absolutely it is7/10: Exciting and cleverly developed"
" Too Bland to be This Long
",0.0,-0.4864,2021-02-03 00:00:00,6,"I'm going to keep this review short for those who want to get to the point. I love musicals, and I've seen the original Broadway play, BUT movies are not meant to be this long. My attention span is not that hard to grasp, I sat through Avengers Infinity War and Endgame, and I was actually sad there wasn't more content when both movies were over. Unfortunately, Into the Woods was way too long for what is was worth. This story took so long to get to the point, and even if it needed to be this long, writers could've done a better job in keeping it interesting and going at constant fast-ish pace. This is a movie you watch once just to say you've seen it because it's way longer than it needed to be, not to mention a bit boring at some points, to watch for a second time. I would give a 6.5/10 because the good mostly out ways the bad, but 6 will have to do."
" A lot of singing
",0.0,0.8785,2021-01-31 00:00:00,6,"Even though I'm not crazy about musicals, the acting was very good. It was actually a good movie just wish less singing."
" Great first two acts
",0.6249,0.8223,2021-01-27 00:00:00,7,"This movie is very entertaining with all of the intertwining stories but the third act brought everything to a standstill.All of the characters just seemed to be randomly placed and doing random things for random reasons. All deaths seemed random as well with no purpose other than to move the plot.Overall, the music is nice and the original fairy tales are refreshing but you should turn it off after the second act."
" So bad!
",-0.623,-0.3054,2021-01-26 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst movies I have ever watched! The story was ok, but the singing and the songs were so cringe. I just couldn't listen to them. I had to fast-forward all the songs."
" So disappointed
",-0.5256,0.0671,2021-01-25 00:00:00,1,"The singing wasn't great and was quite dark, recorded it for my girl and glad I watched it before as she would of been scared, really wanted more from this, definitely wasn't uplifting."
" Forgettable Music & Inane Lyrics
",0.0,0.9695,2021-01-23 00:00:00,2,"I have no idea why anyone thinks either the original play and by extension this movie adaptation is good. Literally every song is completely vanilla & forgettable before you even walk out of the theater. Seriously, there's no danger any of these songs will ever get stuck in your head. Accompanying the lifeless ""melodies"" are the most vapid lyrics you ever heard where the characters I guess are supposed to utter every single uninteresting thought that comes into their head, something like, ""So I'll bake some bread, then sweep the floor, and do some more mundane things, but suddenly now I need to go into the woooooooods"". No, those aren't actual lyrics, I just made them up, but they easily could be, especially because I made absolutely certain none of them rhymed as that might run the risk of being a little bit catchy.
Lastly, be sure to have every character unnecessarily repeat their lyrics 15 times, because this mashup of a half-dozen, one-dimensional fairytales you spend 5 minutes reading to children as bedtime stories needs SOMETHING to stretch it into 2 hours.If you really want to enjoy this movie I heartily recommend the ""Avatar"" method, which is to say visually it's really well done, so just turn the sound off while you play some music that is ACTUALLY good and time period relevant, for example the ""Princess Bride"" soundtrack, and then you can sit through this film and not feel like you wasted the last 2 hours."
" Great musical; solid movie
",0.6908,0.8341,2021-01-22 00:00:00,7,"Into The Woods is an extremely fun and enjoyable musical, and this movie adaptation works well for the most part."
" This is a great family movie
",0.6249,0.9273,2021-01-17 00:00:00,7,I absolutely love this movie and I like the music and the characters and just the whole movie and the actors. It is a great movie for the whole family. Would recommend watching this movie.
" This was awful
",-0.4588,-0.2023,2021-01-08 00:00:00,2,"So first some positives
Anna Kendrick, Emily blunt, and Meryl Streep's performances were all great Streep in particular.Some of the songs are goodEverything else is bad the first half of the movie was a 3 out of 10
Then halfway through the movie changes and becomes a 1 out of 10It just was really bad and boring loop"
" Major PEDOPHILIA Undertones!
",0.0,-0.9028,2021-01-06 00:00:00,1,"Disney is so disgusting that they would rate this PG. We started to watch this with our children, but after the horrific pedophilia song, we had to turn it off. It was so incredibly uncomfortable and extremely DISTURBING. Of course though, Disney counts on people to watch movies like this because of the actors in it. Hopefully you will see this - or the MANY other agreeing reviews - before you watch it."
" Very underrated
",0.0,0.9095,2021-01-03 00:00:00,10,"I watch this musical several times a year, it is extremely entertaining. I love all the characters. From Johnny Depp to Chris Pine this is an amazing cast."
" I'm so confused...
",0.0,0.6119,2021-01-01 00:00:00,3,"I saw the movie for the first time without ever seeing the play... it started so beautifully; the singing was beautiful, the wardrobe, the acting... but then I couldn't follow the story anymore. Things were happening and I couldn't understand why or how. The characters have no depth and there were no good explinations for the things they did. The movie ended and I felt like I watched nothing, and it was so disappointing considering how good the movie seemed at the beginning."
" Mistake

",0.0,0.7495,2020-12-21 00:00:00,10,"So three quarters of the reviews I've read start complaining about being a musical. They showed that in the ads. Singing hmmm?' Has anyone seen on The Little Mermaid, Mulan, Moana. The ads also have a dark tone. Read the fairytales. Oh and PG means PARENTAL GUIDANCE! If you walked out perhaps you should have paid more attention to what you're walking into in the first place. All that being said what a fun movie, great cast and great singing. I'm really surprised at all the negative reviews. It would be sad if every Disney movie was butterflies and roses."
" Kind of plain.
",0.0,-0.9343,2020-12-16 00:00:00,6,"I saw this movie when it came out in theaters, aka very young. Now as somebody reaching adulthood, did I change my mind?No. This is merely an OKAY passable movie in the disney collection that will get lost in the cycle of mediocre disney films.As a kid, I had no clue that this was a musical. I was fine with that, but the story was just forgettable. And Long. And Tedious. And that's not good if your target audience is a bunch of kids. I had checked out of the movie during the fake wedding.The only thing really keeping me in touch with the movie were the performances and music. They were both great. And for the most part the CGI was pretty good too. But holy hell that big bad wolf scene where they leave his belly was terribly done. Like very very bad.And that's all I remembered from this movie. Besides when that guy and his horse both wipe out to meryl streep. So this is just a passable movie and a passable musical."
" Cheating and flirting with another's wife made it worst movie
",-0.7845,-0.9756,2020-12-15 00:00:00,1,"This movie was supposed to be for children but it showed some adult style kissing and cheating . Cinderella's prince cheated on Cinderella and kissed baker's wife .
What a pathetic . The producer must lost his mind or something else in his ugly mind .it was too long that it ended up being very boring . All dialogues were tuned into songs which made no sense . Don't waste your time .
Worst part was ending which mixed up different characters ."
" Too long and tedious
",0.0,0.9764,2020-11-21 00:00:00,4,"I just watched this forgotten Disney musical on Disney +, because I thought it could be nice. The duration seemed unusually long for a musical but I liked the plot so I gave it a go. It was a bad decision.It's a movie that could have been better if it was shorter and had less characters. 2 hours it's too much, the first hour is pretty neat, then it just gets worse and by the last 40 minutes I just didn't care about the story anymore and wanted it ended already. There's simply too much going on, not enough character development and too many subplots that don't go anywhere and make the film innecesarily long. Lots of songs, which are fine, but not memorable, no wonder any of the songs is remembered 6 years after this movie was released.The photography and costumes are also very nice with beautiful landscapes and well done costumes, but does it really matter if the movie it's not worth watching? Only recommended if you really like musicals and fairy tales. Also not for children, they're going to be extremely bored as well."
" Overall it disappoints due to its poor pacing and gappy plot
",-0.6908,0.9515,2020-11-14 00:00:00,6,"Too drawn out, 90 minutes might've been perfect.I like the idea of 'Into the Woods', with its mash-up of numerous fairy tales from 'Cinderella' to 'Little Red Riding Hood' to 'Jack and the Beanstalk' to 'Rapunzel'. I'd also say the musical pieces are enjoyable across the opening 20-30 minutes, which are nice and energetic.However, from the midway point things start chugging down to a snail's pace. The novelty of the premise begins to wear thin, as it becomes clear that there isn't much more to tell - despite a load of the 125 minute run time still remaining. I will say, though, the look of the film is pleasant.I do also rate the casting. James Corden seems to split opinion online, but I've always liked him; having watched and enjoyed him since his career took off with UK TV's 'Gavin & Stacey'. Emily Blunt and Johnny Depp are two of my favourite actors, while Meryl Streep and Anna Kendrick are strong casts. I like Chris Pine too, but he's iffy in this.In conclusion, I almost found entertainment with this but overall it disappoints due to its poor pacing and gappy plot."
" Drama musical is okay but for me ""Into the Woods"" was a confusing mashup of fairy tales.
",-0.2263,0.9158,2020-11-07 00:00:00,1,"After reading the reviews posted, I'm wondering if I saw the wrong film. To me, ""Into the Woods"" was a confusing mashup of fairy tales, with random music interspersed between the tenuously linked story lines. Now for the record, I am a regular subscriber to musical theatre, so I am not a redneck genre hater. Hell, I even liked Xanadu (the movie). I love most of Sondheim's musicals, but this one got away from me almost from the start. The concept of darkening everything up did appeal to me, but I was so confused by mid film, that I stopped caring. And what was the message of the film? That cheating on your spouse is OK if you're a powerful man, but not if you're a woman. That terror is a tool to reach your end goal. The end justifies the means, so its OK to lie, steal and cheat to achieve your goal.I hope the cash that you laid out for the star power in this one gets the tax break you were looking for. On a positive note, Johnny Depp was delightfully creepy as the wolf.As the great philosopher Bart Simpson once said ""This movie sucks and blows at the same time"". Congratutions Disney, you tossed a huge turd on the table with this one"
" Boring and way too long
",-0.3182,0.9201,2020-10-30 00:00:00,1,"So much money spend and good actors and lovely costumes but something is missing,and this tiny something is moral that each and every story has in its original version.Pointless at best, waste of talent and time."
" I loved this movie musical!!

I can't believe the amount of hate & low ratings on here. But then I read those reviews & lost some brain cells from the stupidity. So many with so little culture!

It has a fantastic, quality cast!
A subversive, dark, reimagining of a collection of fairytales in the one world.Sounds perfect.But no. This was painful. Too much singing. And yes, I know it is a musical, but still, too much, unnecessary singing.And it dragged on.I saw it with a friend and didn't want to leave the cinema presuming she was enjoying it. Turns out, she disliked it too and was sticking it out for me. Cue: face palm. Other patrons did walk out.The care factor for characters and their plight is zilch.Such potential, over hyped, very disappointing."

Its dark theme makes this movie one of Disney's best live action musical films. The characters are all intriguing in their own way. And the acting is marvelous. So all in all, Into the Woods is a delightful, highly entertaining classic."

But now after watching it at 26 yo of mine, I'm surprised how it have a lot more meaning to me. It is absolutely not meant for kids to watch, but totally for grown ups.The scenario, feelings, relationships , etc are so complicated and realistic and at the same time ""fictional"" that you would agree with the story the whole time.

" Could have been much better
",0.4404,0.6204,2020-06-12 00:00:00,6,"I deliberately avoided watching this movie when it came out as I was put off by all the bad reviews. Finally I decided to and I can now say I am understanding of the poor reviews, but also can see parts that were actually worthy of praise.The big let down was the missing parts left out from the original musical's story. That leaves the movie in a state of absent scenes which would have completed the plot. A lot of people complained in their reviews the movie made no sense, that is because of the missing pivotal scenes. It also stops the movie from flowing correctly and you find yourself in a place where it's hard to relate to what the characters are going through.This musical movie is no more for a child to watch than Les Miserables is. It is emotional and dramatic in ways only an adult can appreciate. I personally wouldn't let a child watch it. Because it's Disney does not mean it's for children. There's even cartoons Disney has produced in its beginnings that I wouldn't let my child see.Johnny Depp's wolf was not a pedophile, he was a carnivore. A sadistic, animalistic carnivore. He was indeed creepy, but the lyrics included the eating of the grandmother too, which was also creepy. The character is meant to be creepy. No different than the witch who tricked Hansel and Gretel into getting fat and plump so she could eat them.The music is unfortunately a tad forgetful as there wasn't much catchiness or memorable melodies. But it was sung very well and the acting was really good. Streep and Kendrick were phenomenal and Cordon was a believable baker. Pine made a very handsome Prince Charming also and all of this was achieved despite the missing scenes, which is impressive.It's sad that it felt so incomplete as it could have been a masterpiece that I would have loved to watch again. But I'd rather see the musical on stage in its full version."

" A Good Sondheim Adaptation Makes for a Great Modern Musical.
",0.7906,0.9995,2020-05-01 00:00:00,8,"A Stephen Sondheim musical provides completely different pleasures from most other musicals. They aren't about jaunty tunes and family fun. They're intimate, dense with growing meaning, and more than a little sinister. The music functions not as separate parts of the story but as story amplifiers. And so, despite the surface level entertainment in Rob Marshall's Into the Woods, the film is always working at least one level deeper. Sondheim's influence is that strong, and the film is that pleasurable.Into the Woods, which began life as a broadway play in 1987, is branded as a mashup of mature takes on famous fairy tales. Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, and others are tied together in a sprawling, interconnected fable on childhood, parenting, repression and fidelity. It's such rich material to start with, both as a lighter family friendly remix on old staples and as a more sophisticated allegory. Rob Marshall competently directs, moving the story along, hitting beats, and indulging in the occasional flourish. However, he does not ring everything he could from Sondheim's ingredients. The movie never goes as dark as it suggests it could. Without spoiling anything, there is a through line of death and sexuality in Into the Woods. To lean hard into these elements could be absolutely fascinating, especially juxtaposed with the childhood icons the story centers on. Unfortunately, Marshall sanitizes a lot of the edgier stuff. He seems to be a director in love with the crowd-pleasing classic musical, a love he utilized to extraordinary heights in his Oscar-winning Chicago, but seems occasionally at odds with the story here. A perfect adaptation of Into the Woods needs a director who isn't afraid to alienate a segment of the audience looking for an unchallenging romp. Marshall challenges no one, but keeps Sondheim's ideas, all the same.I don't see it necessary to recall the best musical numbers, because the songs don't function as ""numbers"" per se. Sondheim songs melt into the story rather than stand out from it. To the point where, when the movie is running at its best, you almost don't notice where song ends and dialogue begins. That's not a knock on the melodies, which emerge nicely in the opening mega-ballad, Giants in the Sky, and Agony. Otherwise, the lyrics and mood of the music is what is most appreciated. The songs grow and build and meld together in interesting ways. You listen closely to the words, and enjoy the rhythms on a more subtle level.The performers may be the most roaringly successful aspect of the film. From what I can tell, this is a musically inclined cast, full of great classical singers. James Corden is oddly impressive in a major role, Johnny Depp has a memorable cameo, and Chris Pine does fine work as Prince Charming, although the female leads, Anna Kendrick, Meryl Streep, and a luminous Emily Blunt, excel best. Kendrick is the best singer of the bunch, Streep has one or two great scenes and one show-stopping song (Stay With Me), but Emily Blunt is the best of both worlds. She gives a superb, run-the-gamut performance, going from funny, to heartfelt, to warm, and motherly. As charismatic a turn as I've ever seen from her. The child actors who play Jack and Red are also really impressive singers, who carry tough roles extremely well.Into the Woods is one of Stephen Sondheim's three best plays, and with the talent involved, my expectations for this adaptation were enormous. In the end, it's not perfect. Rob Marshall shies away from the unsavory cynicism of the play, crafting a more palpable middlebrow entertainer at the expense of something really daring. But every technical department is doing solid work here. The film looks and sounds like a million bucks. It's staged well, acted with enthusiasm, and directed handsomely. Even if it's not a revelation, a good solid adaptation of Stephen Sondheim is still a much appreciated treasure.81/100"
" It was Nice, until...
",0.4215,0.9654,2020-04-30 00:00:00,7,"Honestly, I didn't think I'd enjoy this as much as I did. I think the integration of characters from multiple fairy tales is an intriguing concept, and the execution is fairly good. The fairy tales, in themselves, occasionally feel unsatisfying and pedestrian, but I found the main plot that weaves all of them together, to my surprise, interesting. The songs are ranging from ones that are truly excellent to ones that are just fine (if a bit dumb and definitely far from memorable). Every member of the star-studded cast did a decent job (especially Emily Blunt), although I found Meryl Streep's performance as The Witch a bit too silly, but I guess this has to do with the character itself. Yes, there are many unnecessary sub-plots, but I didn't mind that as much. And I actually liked the dark spin that's put on some of the fairy tales (Cinderella, as a case in point). Everything was surprisingly good (except for the plastic production design) until everything fell apart, figuratively and literally. The movie became far more awkwardly edgy and dark for its own good, as if that would made it ""subversive""... I guess. And the plot became completely incoherent at the last act, the songs became insufferably terrible and the movie overall became an utter mess, and all this due to that stupid decision. I didn't end up even liking this.(7/10)"

Therein, however, lay many of the problems. Most theatrical performances thrive because the audience knows the limits of the staging and substitutes their imagination for the extra; the cast work together week-after-week (hopefully!) so there is usually a chemistry between them that helps keep the story engaging for those watching. This, on the other hand has all the necessary SFX to render that imagination largely redundant. This leaves us with some over-powering musical numbers that have no understanding of, or sympathy with, their new medium - Lilly Crawford (""Little Red Riding Hood"") positively shrieks her way through her songs with a grating accent that could strip paint. I'm sure I saw Billy Magnussen's uber-coiffured hair slide down over his eyes at one point too! Chris Pine, Emily Blunt and Johnny Depp are all strong in their usual acting habitats, but musical theatre isn't for everyone - and here, it certainly is not for them. Tracey Ullman & Frances de la Tour seem to have a better (if brief) grasp of what is expected, but I am afraid that this just goes to testify that budget + willpower does not turn this particular straw into gold."

I was not aware Johnny Depp could sing. The film can get a bit cheesy but that's the point. Broadway is always cheesy. The film is also surprisingly dark. It's based on the original Grimm Brothers fairy tales and not the sugar-coated sweet Disney versions. (Yay!) The whole film is fun and has something for everyone to enjoy.

It's a brilliant comentary on life, mashup of familiar fairytales and the cast is AMAZING. Remember this was originally written and performed in a different era, yes. But the morals of the story apply to all ages. And ""Children Will Listen"". Yes, there are some hokey bits, but that's part of its charm. Meryl is fantastic! Daniel Huttlestone (also memorable from Les Miserables on screen) has a show-stopper with ""Giants In The Sky"" and ""Agony"" with Chris Pine is a must see for Star Trek fans if for no other reason than to giggle at his affectations of a misunderstood prince. He's fabulous!
My daughter is now 9 and can sing along to the whole show. She has taken it all in stride since she was first watching it at 5 - and if you can't do that in today's entertainment age, then maybe you need to lighten up a bit ;-) Enjoy the music & comedy!"

" They totally missed the moral of the story
",-0.3597,-0.9933,2020-01-08 00:00:00,6,"I remember waiting for this movie to come out. I'd grown up listening to Bernadette Peters. Performed lesser characters myself until I finally got to be the Witch. This movie had an all star cast and I was so excited.End credits roll, and I sat there more angry than sad. A musical with so many moral lessons and all the movie can focus on is KILLING the Giant as the big finale. The whole movie ends with Children Will Listen and all I can think of is the kids who just learned that it is ok to kill to get what you want.Yes the Giant dies in the musical but because of the limitations of stage the scene is less about getting that giant but focuses on the people struggling to survive against giant odds. Also, the true finale of the musical has a wonderful lesson that is completely cut out the movie. ...There is one last reprise of the theme ""Into the woods"" One verse says, ""... Into the woods but not to stray or tempt the wolf or steal from the giant."" Because, let's face it, the giant is the most innocent party in the whole play. She was kind to the thieving, murderous boy, Jack.""Into the woods, each time you go There's more to learn of what you know. ..Into the woods to mind the wolf, to Heed the witch, to Honor the giant. .... into the woods. Then out of the woods -- and happily ever after!"" Then Cinderella says, ""I wish..."" and everyone looks at her in horror .... because, let's face it, the one thing humans are good at is forgetting life lessons.None of this is in the movie ...Not to mention the missing characters such as the narrator/father (well, the many funny theater scenes) ... and all the much needed comic relief crafted into the second half of the musical. (Because the body count is no laughing matter. :)The musical has an intermission after they all get their happy ever after ... so when you see them again time has passed & they are all back to wanting more. Then the giantess starts destroying things as she looks for Jack (because he murdered her Husband ... can't stress that jolly tidbit enough) and their petty wants get pushed aside as life completely is changed for everyone.I would like to say that my disappointment is like that of one whose favorite book is made into a movie ... not everything can fit into those 2 hours. However, this movie did a disservice to those who have never seen the real deal. I have see it/been in it. Can spout almost every line ad nauseam and yet I still cry at the end of even High school Productions. This movie left me cold. I still cry at the ""eyes of an angel..."" animal commercials, but the movie just didn't provide me with an emotional connection.Then there is the scene where the baker runs off after finding out his wife has died. In the play the mysterious man (aka his father) says, ""We disappoint, we disappear, we die but we don't. . . "" and the baker sing a short heartbreaking song that ends, ""...No more giants waging! Can't we just pursue our lives w/our children & our wives 'til that happy day arrives, how do you ignore
All the witches, all the curses, the false hopes, the good-byes, the reverses
All the wondering what even worse is still in store
All the children
All the giants .... just, no more ""In theater we are taught that the actor NOT crying is powerful. You sob because his words resignate, not because he is showing us how sad he is. It's the writer's version of show don't tell.Then there are the children. According to the bonus features, the director feels its supposed to be children and not teenagers. I very very much beg to differ. Hello little girl is a seduction song and has many innuendos that worked sort of ok as Lilla looks 13 -14. Jack is a simpleton but not a child. With them as teenagers, there is a growing up they are suddenly forced to do. They truly have no one. The song, No one is alone didn't seem as powerful because these kids are so young that obviously someone will take care of them. And it seems odd that the baker is willing to say no to letting them stay with him when Jack can't be over 10. Now, if they were teens, then his reluctance is more understandable. Red is a bit scarier in the musical, pulling out her knife ... a fact which makes it funnier when the baker is horrified his wife would leave the baby with Red.The baker and his wife do not argue as much as they do in the play. Theirs is NOT a perfect marriage. No marriage is, but the reality in their relationship are what allow her to be seduced by the prince and let us accept it as paet of her character flaw.In the play, Rapunzel blames the witch for her unhappiness and says, ""because of you, I will never be happy again."" The Witch, whose own mother was NOT great example of motherhood (I mean seriously, who puts a curse on their own child?) Truly tries to protect her child by going to the way opposite extreme (there are parents out there like that). Yes, she does some horrible things in the name of love and she is definitely not a nice person. Her mistakes and how they affected her child go with the theme of the play. Later, Rapunzel is stepped on by the giant as she runs away from the Witch who is trying to save her which changes the whole tone of the Stay with me reprise ... they should've just got rid of that reprise if they were going to change that storyline.I rewatched the movie recently thinking maybe I was so disappointed in 2014 because I had too high of expectations. But no, it is because they took a deep, well-crafted musical and morphed it into an odd sort of movie. They should have just done act 1 and ended it there. Oh, wait, that's basically what they did."

The opening score has amazing actors trying to sing/talk in a ""Rex Harrison"" kind of style, and failing badly.
It doesn't get any better as you travel ""into the woods""!
This adaptation becomes lost between being a film or a musical, achieving neither. Luckily the strong cast are already established in the industry and aren't relying on this for further work.

The only ""redeemable"" thing about this movie were certain somewhat decent songs, though many of which were simply lines that could have easily been spoken but they chose to sing them for some reason.

",0.0,-0.9596,2019-10-28 00:00:00,3,"I am a huge Sondheim fan, and also of many of the actors in the film. But this was a mess. But I also had not realized just how badly Disney had mangled and chopped up the story line and plot.
First off I am a little disappointed in the songs. They were almost inter-changeable; very similar. And as great as Johnny Depp is as actor, he should not sing. Ever. He already ruined ""Sweeney Todd"" for me. Meryl Streep, one of the greatest actresses of our times, is also not the best singer.
But the biggest issue I have is the non sense plot. I was left speechless after Act 2. It makes no sense. The giant, Rapunzel, the princes - why even bother having them in there to begin with? Their story lines fizzle out. The witch, a major player, just kind of disappears. the notion that the baker's wife had sex with the prince came out of nowhere, and went nowhere.
It would not have been a very respectable tale, but ultimately the film version should have just ended with a happy ending during the big celebration and wedding.
But it is supposed to be a completely different moral in the B'way show; and this isn';t dealt with AT ALL in the film.
PS I do find it ridiculous that there are reviewers taking offense with Depp's character, and his actions. I mean - come on: it s a fairy tale. Those stories are grim, wolves eat little girls and then they crawl back out to life That's the way things are done."

Disney's classic musicals such as The Jungle Book, Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin, Lion King, etc are elevated to classic status because they were very very good. Even for adults ears, the songs are catchy and nice. Not a single song sung in this movie was good. None. They were all irritating, repetitive, and boring, not to mention pointless and added nothing to the story.Acting:
The movie is full of famous actors, but their acting in this movie was very half-assed and amateurish. None of them did a convincing job.The Story:
I know it's a fantasy/fairytale, it doesn't supposed to make sense. But the story was weird just for the sake of being weird, it was not entertaining at all to watch, both for kids and adults alike.The Costume & Makeup:
With Disney's budget, the costume and makeup were very amateurish and cheap looking. None of them were innovative nor impressive.

The music is beautiful, fun, and odd and the lyrics are complex, poetic, and beautiful. Stephen Sondheim is the greatest musical theatre composer and this is one of his best works. James Lapine's original musical book is also phenomenal. It's hysterical, dark, scary, emotional, and tragic.The casting here is good, for the most part. Meryl Streep is perfect as The Witch, a role created by the great Bernadette Peters. Emily Blunt is lovely, but occasionally misses the comedic nature of her role. The kids who play Jack and Little Red are wonderful. Anna Kendrick is positively awful. She doesn't capture the neurotic and manic demeanor that this version of Cinderella requires. She also doesn't have the pretty operatic soprano that the role is written as. James Corden just doesn't work for me. He's just not right for the role. Most of the rest of the cast is pretty take it or leave it.The direction and design here is atrocious. The film is ugly, garish, filled with plastic looking CGI. It also tries it's hardest to be as Disney as possible. The musical is scary and violent. The violence is skipped over here which hurts the story. The darkness comes off as false and the whole second act is destroyed. The entire heart of the film has been ripped out and stomped on. The musical makes me weep at the end. This film made me feel absolutely nothing. It's some of the worst adapting of material that I have ever seen.This needed an artsy team that would embrace the black comedy, darkness, and beauty of the musical.

This movie is the adaptation of as Broadway musical so of course it's going to be a musical. I understand not everyone enjoys musicals so this movie is not going to be for everyone. However grading a musical down just because you do not enjoy musicals is simple not fair. What ruined the movie for me was most of the main cast could not carry a tune or sing better than an amateurish level. I have seen high school performances of this show with better singing voices. Even Meryl Streep who is a wonderful actor was a pale imitation of Pia Zadora orginal performance. Why cant Hollywood hire people who can actually sing for musica instead of the usual stunt casting. If the rest if cast is good a musical can get buy with one bong singer if there performance is good enough. The King and I and Camalot are two good examples of this. However in this horrible adaptation none of the cast had great singing voices. Why Streep would be involved with this production is mind boggling. If your a fan of the orginal musical or just a fan of good music stay far away from this.

" Terrible plot; characters do not at credibly
",-0.4767,-0.8756,2019-01-27 00:00:00,2,"Into the Woods is like two movies. The first half - about a mission to fulfill the wishes of a witch- is loyal to the fairy tales narrative. But the second half of the movie bares almost no relation to the first half (other than having the same characters), the music feels terribly repetitive by then, and the movie is almost blue all the time, lacking the typical colorful aspect of musicals (even a musical as dark as ""Sweeney Todd"" keeps bright colors) and, worst of all, the plot is uninteresting and the characters actions are unbelievable (giving no details to avoid spoilers).
The actors are great, but out of that, this is maybe one of the weakest musicals I have seen on film."

How wrong was I in every way. The movie is almost flawless; the performances, production design, costumes, hair & make up, singing. Streep's voice rivals all the stage greats and is standout. (Gotta be honest found her transformation a bit cheesy in a Death Comes Her way.) Lilla Crawford is a knockout against Depp, The Agony Boys are a triumph and underrated Chris Pine's homage to Dick Van Dyke is hysterical especially when he's singing. I could go on but I want to go back for a second viewing !"

The songs by Stephen Sondheim are all quite good though none of them stands out as particularly memorable. They are all well sung by the performers, however, within a stunning set design and amazing costumes. Streep shows her usual magic (beyond witchcraft) in that she's as good a singer as she is an actress - which says a lot."

Into the Woods was a convoluted patchwork of out of control egos, misdirection, confusion, no discernible cohesion, lack of even a scintilla of artistic taste, just an abomination. What was Disney thinking by putting its name on this catastrophe? I also wonder about the parents who inadvertently brought their children to see this movie. What must they have thought? Were the children frightened, or more likely, confused? The beginning of the film seemed interesting. As each new character was introduced, each fairy tale thrown away in a poorly developed or more precisely undeveloped careless fashion, I couldn't keep watching it. It was so bad, such a waste of time and talent and money. And to think that such a disaster of a film made money for Disney which is a tragedy, because it might encourage the studio to make more such pictures. Absolutely awful."

Quentin Tarantino, in Pulp Fiction, took a chance by changing directions of viewer expectations (eg: when Bruce went into the pawn shop) and it worked amazingly. I think the director of Into The Woods attempted this as well, and sorry...it flopped. Even my 8 year old was perplexed by all events after the wedding scene, and then yelled out, ""really, that's the ending?"", when they transition to the clouds at the end. Sorry guys, nice attempt though..."

Yes, not every song presented is a hit but still the actors are doing an excellent job in acting and singing and the production/settings are gorgeous.What kind of story people do expect if something is based on the works of the Brothers Grimm, I dunno. The stories are well known and the approach of mixing some of them together works imo well.Anyway, Into the Woods is no masterpiece but still a good watch for your eyes and a good to okay listening for your ears.

In fact, some of the songs, costumes and sets in this movie are impressive. Nevertheless, I remain mostly unimpressed with this Sondheim musical."
" It was okay
",0.2263,0.9721,2018-12-28 00:00:00,6,It want to say the first portion of the film was stunning. I loved the first half of the film but the second half I just wanted the movie to be over(and not in a good way). I personally think the film should have ended when James Gordon was saying happily ever after. If you haven't seen the film right before James could finish his sentence a giant attacks. Everything after this point in the movie was boring. Except for the song where the characters where they are trying to figure out who's fault it was for the giant attacking. I was really confused when James Gordon started to tell his baby about what happened over those few days. I think everyone did an amazing job with their roles except the person who played Repunzel. I think they could have had Kira Knightly play her. This is all just my opinion if you loved the movie that is great if you didn't that is great as well. I am not saying you shouldn't watch the movie but in my opinion just stop when James Gordon starts to say happily ever after. You can Google the song where the characters are blaming everything on each other on YouTube if you want. Again this is all my opinion I am fine if yours is different.

OK lets get to the point. No this is not a film for young children. It is rather disturbing,I admit that. But nevertheless these reviews are bull.
People are saying that as soon as you started to follow they changed it. THAT'S WHAT A GOOD MOVIE IS! do you want a move that you will know what will happen as soon as it starts? I know i don't.
OK so someone said tat the witch turned herself into mud? No! If yo were listening to the song lyrics you would know that the witch did not turn herself into mud, her mother dragged her to hell through some acid pool.
People are also saying that here was no humor? This was not intended for it to be a Jeff dunham episode! This is a brothers Grimm remix movie so of coarse there will be no humor.
Fans are of the play are saying that they cut out songs and scenes from the play thats because ts a Disney movie so the still have to keep it mildly family friendly.
So yea this is a good movie. and to all of you complainers i just have to say this: Grow up you baby's! im 13 and i get all of that! I was 9 when this came out and i got most of that so...yea. Dont judge me just because of my age. This is a true review not just a kid saying ""Disney rules!"" honestly i would rather be watching YouTube right now.

I have seen some bad and cheap movies that took the bar at the lowest level but for this, you will an excavator to go as far as you can on the negative scale. I made it in for about 20 minutes or so, skipped ahead and then pulled the dvd out of the player thinking all that time, there must be some sort of redeeming quality that I am about to see.

The plot; what plot? If you remember the fairy tales of your childhood, you'll be disappointed, because none are here in entirety. This is a mish mash of several childhood stories, all entangled, so nothing makes any sense. Why five stars? My musical loving girlfriend liked it; not loved it, but liked it. Did she ever want to see it again? No. And that's why 5. I was able to watch the whole thing through without feeling like I had to escape the show. While I love some of Sondheim's work, this looks like something created because he owed someone a score. You want to watch great Sondheim, you'll enjoy watching West Side Story the 100th time more than you will watching this.

",0.484,0.9959,2018-08-30 00:00:00,7,"Right, I usually don't write reviews but someone needs to set the record straight here! Yes, this film is a musical, yes, it has adult themes but what were you expecting? I honestly am surprised at the amount of people that don't do a little research before going to see a film to see what it's roughly about. Although maybe Disney shouldn't have been the company to take on a musical like this as they're a company that primarily caters for a younger audience, they did their best to tone it down and still say truthful to the original story. It isn't as if Disney has never dealt with mature themes before. Whilst there is an instance where Johnny Depp's character, the Wolf, sings mildly suggestive lyrics (which are likely to go over most children's head's anyway) about eating Little Red Riding Hood and her Grandmother and some kissing between the Prince and the Baker's Wife (they are not married to each other but married to other partners so it is technically adultery), it really isn't that extreme. But moving on from that, the acting and the singing can't be faulted. Meryl Streep puts on an incredible singing performance and so does Johnny Depp which I was surprised about. Chris Pine puts on a very funny performance as the Prince. Other than him though, the comedy is lacking a little. The original production is a lot funnier. The set is impressive and all in all I would say it's worth the watch."

Meryl Streep was good too, but giving her an Oscar nomination is a joke. The fanatsy part worked too. The directing was exciting, and the CGI was fine and this whole world/forest had its feeling.
There were only two things that made me disappointed. One of them are the songs. They weren't that bad just nothing special, nothing that stayed with me after the movie.
The other thing was the plot. After an hour I thought the movie was finishing. And then the whole second part of the movie was like a sequel. And this story is a fairytale, so there is no suprises which made me disappointed.
I could recommend for some people who like musicals and Disney tales, but you wouldn't expect something brilliant, just an entertaining movie with a lot of stars in it."

The film has an all star cast like Meryl Streep, Frances De La Tour, James Corden, Emily Blunt, Anna Kendrick and more. The film style is mostly dark for young audiences but perhaps the film will win them over with the music. The music is perhaps Sondheim's best musical score of all his musicals so we can expect darkness with light and fairy tales with reality. Meryl Streep is awesome as the Witch."
" Better On Stage
",0.4404,0.992,2018-07-13 00:00:00,6,"As a longtime fan of the original Broadway recording with Bernadette Peters, I was excited to see this as a large scale production. The sets are amazing and costuming is great and even the cast is well full of good talent. One of the things that makes a good musical great is all the work that goes into the harmonies and vocal work, especially in such a music heavy piece like this Sondheim creation. There is none of that here, voices are mostly electronically mixed and where there should be a swell of harmony, you find it seems 'lifeless' to put not to fine a point on it. The film is entertaining and fun even with the deviations to the original plot and themes, but lacks the emotional work and true emsemble work that really sets this particular musical experience apart from other stage and film pieces. See the original with Chip Zein, Bernadette, Joanna Gleeson etc. and then this version, and you may find yourself feeling the same way. Fun flick, better on stage with live talent."
" A total waste
",-0.4215,-0.9744,2018-07-04 00:00:00,1,"A total waste. No real songs, glossed over/abbreviated stories, more so-so acting than should be in a major production, and unimaginative art direction/costumes. It's supposed to be a musical, but there aren't really any songs. It's almost entirely just sing-songy dialogue that happens to have random bits of music flitting around behind it. The fairytales either need to be ""fractured"" for silliness or delivered faithfully. Not just muddled for convenience-sake like this. Worst of all, no progression. Most of the way through, the husband and wife characters do a whole speech/song about how the husband's character has changed, but it hasn't. There aren't any character arcs at all by that point in the movie. Oh, and the acting. Red Riding Hood is too old, too loud, and really obnoxious. The two princes seemed very hard to believe as heterosexuals, especially during their big duet. The husband/wife seemed like a modern suburban couple (of green actors). The entire set design is dark blue/green. What's the point of having a production design budget if there's nothing to look at? And who designed Depp's Big Bad Wolf costume, or lack thereof? Not only is that lazy, but it also makes the scene seem more like a weird old man hitting on a young girl than like an animal wanting to consume her. Wrong kind of creepy, guys. Finally, I'm generally annoyed at Disney's new self-flagellating trend to appease classic-fairytale-Disneyfying haters. Once Upon a Time and other such TV shows were bad enough as examples of ironically anti-Disney products. The original versions of the fairytales that Disney adapted in the past were horrific, and I was glad to see them cleaned up and made kid-friendly. Heck, civilized-society friendly. This movie is an example of backsliding. Disney needs to stop the self-hate and embrace its tradition as a positive shaper of our modern mythology. In short, skip this movie. It's abject cultural flotsam."

I have to say I was wrong, as I seriously enjoyed it. I enjoy a good musical anyway and I love Anna Kendrick, so I am slightly biased.I think Anna Kendrick is a great actress (see Up In The Air) but I tend to not love her movies, and usually only make it through them, due to me having a weird crush on her!! She is not obviously attractive, but she has a certain something about her. She does have a great voice, but she seems to be stuck making Pitch Perfect sequels and things like Mr Right and Get A Job, when she is capable of so much more. One of my main problems with this is, it just tries to incorporate too many subplots!! Like with Dark Shadows trying to get years worth of storylines from the tv show in to one movie. This is the same!! Truthfully you could have almost removed the entire Emily Blunt character sub plot from the movie and it would not be missed!! There is just too much going on.But I do enjoy it!! James Corden is fine and (one of the nicest celebs I have ever met) as is Chris Pine, sending himself up!! though I was surprised Meryl Streep got an Oscar nod here. As for Depp, he only has two scenes, and less than 5 minutes screen time. Here is his main one. Singing a seriously creepy song that more than hints at something creepier..... or maybe it's just me!!

During the movie, I was hoping it would get to the ending to end. It was all bad; the story, the characters, and nothing like the fairly tales we know and none of them lived ""happily ever after"".

" Musical failure
",-0.5106,-0.6854,2018-01-02 00:00:00,3,"I'd previously watched and love another adaptation of a Stephen Sondheim musical, SWEENEY TODD, so I had high hopes for this fairy tale-based follow-up. Sadly, INTO THE WOODS is a hopeless effort that stalls more often than it succeeds, and much of the failure lies in the poor choice of casting. When two of the leads in your movie are Emily Blunt and James Corden you know you're in trouble, as both are average singers at best and Corden remains an intensely irritating screen presence. Meryl Streep headlines the cast as a goofy witch but seems to be channeling her MAMMA MIA! role a bit too much. The rest of the film strives to mix up elements of various fairy stories including Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood and Rapunzel, but the effect is slapdash and the story all over the place. Anna Kendrick is bland and her singing voice irritating, although not as much as the brash kid playing Red Riding Hood. Some of the CGI is okay but overall this is a huge missed opportunity for me."
" A very pleasant surprise.
",0.7159,0.9995,2017-12-28 00:00:00,9,"Usually, I advise people (friends, family, etc.) to find out more about a movie before they watch it. But there is no rule without exception, so I confess that, this time, I made the mistake of watching this film without do it, last Christmas Eve, with my family, before the traditional Midnight Mass. I knew, however, that it was a Disney movie and it had a star cast with many respected names. It was a ""quality guarantee"", I reasoned. However, it didn't take many minutes to realize that it was a musical. Was that a problem? Not at all. I like any good movie, including musicals, so I will not be bored because it's a musical and I didn't know it.Only now, after some reading, I realize that it's the adaptation of an American Broadway musical which I've obviously never seen. Very few Broadway musicals are brought to the stage here in Portugal. I cannot compare it with the original material but, giving credit to the opinions I read, it seems that it was able to honor the play, which is always positive. So, let's go to the movie itself.The movie mixes a few traditional fairy tales (""Cinderella"", ""Rapunzel"", ""Jack and the Beanstalk"", ""Little Red Riding Hood"") into a single story, deconstructing them and trying to convey a message: we should be careful about what is said to the children. I don't understand the need for this! All these tales have their own morals and I see no harm in any of them. You see, ""Cinderella"" teaches us to be patient and not to ""pay evil with evil"", because we will be rewarded in the future; ""Rapunzel"" teaches us to obey our parents and teaches also parents not to prevent their children from discovering the world and learn to defend themselves; ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" teaches us to be clever, not to be deceived, but also to be bold when it's needed. ""Little Red Riding Hood"" may be the most controversial because of its sexual connotation, but it also teaches us to obey our parents, not to trust unknown people. Are any of these things bad for a child's education? Why dismantle these stories and warn parents about them? There are much more serious things happening to our children under our noses... the technology addiction, the inability of our children to live without being attached to their cell phones or even the high-calorie food we give them are much more serious problems than any children's tale could be.I also heard that the original play was darker, with a more adult approach and potentially inappropriate for children. I understand that, and I believe Disney has made an effort to adapt these content to an audience that, it's known, will have children. And I think that was a very difficult task because I read that play was very good and popular, and it's hard to fiddle with something that has a legion of fans behind, willing to defend it tooth and nail. Anyway, it's a different and original story, much closer to the original tales by Perrault and Grimm, and Disney needs needs to challenge herself. At that point, the movie hit it right.Meryl Streep is extraordinary. A consecrated star, a movie icon, a film dame, but still has physical agility and mental openness to make movies like that! Great voice, great interpretation, what talent! It's worth watching the film just to see her strength; Anna Kendrick made a decent Cinderella and has a good voice but I expected more... sometimes, her was left in the cast; Emily Blunt was very well and has a melodious and elegant voice... she helped to reinforce the weight of the female characters; Tracey Ullman also did a good job; Johnny Depp is always good at this kind of characters, he already has experience and has a good voice too; I didn't know James Corden, but he was the most striking and interesting male actor in the film... he has a good voice and has managed to show some very pleasant psychological complexity; Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen were equally up to their challenge, even though their characters are quite disposable. Looking at the young cast, Lilla Crawford deserves a standing ovation.. this young promise has an excellent voice and it was truly delightful to see her perform. Daniel Huttlestone is not far behind, but his character wasn't as lively and cheerful. The rest of the cast simply did what they should when they should.The technical aspects also don't deserve a negative criticism. As usual in this studio, everything was meticulously thought out. Scenarios were realistic and even CGI, when it was needed, was excellent and looked real, much better than in many action movies out there. I'm still thinking how they did the forest! The costumes also don't disappoint anyone and everything is perfectly in line with what we see in these stories. Maybe I could rethink the costumes of the two princes, I think they were too contemporary, but it's nothing serious. Finally, one last word to speak about soundtrack and the songs. As far as I've been reading, most of them have been imported directly from the musical. They're very beautiful songs, we cannot deny it. It's not that kind of song that stays in our ear days after we see the movie... but it's lively, sometimes quite emotional, always perfectly in line with everything else. There is a certain harmony in all these details that gives beauty to the film as a whole.I conclude by saying that this film was very pleasing to me, it was a pleasant Christmas surprise and it pleased my family too. Okay, it's not a conventional Disney movie, it has some pretty dark moments, but life is that too. And I did not see anything so offensive to children! We watch much worse movies, buy video games full of blood and killings for our children... and then we complain about this movie? If we want to protect our children we must start by imposing rules in our own homes. Time to sleep, time to study, time to watch TV, rules to use the cell phone or computer. It's not what I see in most of my friends' homes that have kids. They rule more than their parents. It's easier for a stressed parent, who is tired to work, give everything the child asks in order to avoid a discussion or a tantrum. When that changes, then you can worry about the movies."

I think this is where the hate for the movie comes because the theatre version is amazing and the movie seem like about 70% of the glory of this.Also the movie suggest some of the worst moral guidance to children. 
as well as some thing that seemed very perverted.However the movie is Good and a musical masterpiece.if you did not watch the theatre version before you will enjoy the movie very much.

" An abundance of CGI can't wallpaper over bad music...
",0.431,0.9118,2017-12-17 00:00:00,4,"... and please excuse the mixed metaphor.This live-action Disney musical based on the Stephen Sondheim stage production was about as enjoyable for me as a root canal. A mash-up of various fairy tales (Little Red Riding Hood, Jack & the Beanstalk, Rapunzel, Cinderella, etc) set to near-continuous terrible music and slathered in overdone CGI. The all-star cast does their best, I suppose, but the only one who made an impression was Chris Pine as a knowingly shallow Prince Charming. Meryl Streep earned Oscar nomination number 19 for her turn as a witch, and she's okay, if a bit over the top. I usually like Emily Blunt and Anna Kendrick, and they are passable here, with Kendrick's vocal skills put to some small good use. Also appearing are the insufferable James Corden (who's currently busy butchering late night television), a poorly used Tracey Ullman, a couple of annoying kids, and a wasted Johnny Depp. Fans of this stage musical may find more to like, but I pretty much hated every minute of it."

It's a musical, songs are so-so. I do like some musicals and some I can't stand - this one is middle ground for me.My big disappointment is the fact that Depp was not in it very long... his character is bumped off about 25 minutes into the film.

I fell asleep so many times and this could the sign of a kinda boring movie. I also just found out, when I finally finished the movie, that it was directed by Rob Marshall, the one whose some of his movies are on my favorite movies list: Memoirs of a Geisha and Chicago. The songs, although not quite entertaining as in Chicago, have beautiful lyrics. Sometimes I think they are out of tune? (Is that a correct term?) Since my listening in English is not so great, I found it a bit hard to follow. They sang too fast sometimes.Emily Blunt and Meryl Streep are my favorite casts here. They both funny, also the twins and the stepmother. I tried to like Anna Kendrick but I still couldn't find her attractive. The story itself is average."

To bad that there were so many great actors in it. So a warning for everyone that looks at the cast, don't get tricked by there names. I am not saying that the actors were awful, it was just the whole production, story and songs. I would have been better i they could have kept it short. But seriously don't watch it, not worth your time. The only thing that you want to do after watching it is to repress the whole thing."
" Wannabe modern ""Wizard of Oz""
",0.0,0.9853,2017-09-13 00:00:00,6,"RELEASED IN 2014 and directed by Rob Marshall, ""Into the Woods"" is a musical about a baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) who venture into the dark forest to find the ingredients a witch (Meryl Streep) says will lift the curse that has made them childless, which will simultaneously restore the witch's beauty. Into this plot are mixed the popular fairy tales of Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford), Cinderella & her prince (Anna Kendrick & Chris Pine), Jack and the Beanstalk (Daniel Huttlestone) and Rapunzel & her prince (Mackenzie Mauzy & Billy Magnussen). Johnny Depp has a glorified cameo as the wolf that preys upon Red Riding Hood.I'm not a fan of musicals, generally speaking, but I love ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939) and ""Into the Woods"" is akin to a modern-day ""Wizard of Oz"" albeit with superior locations/sets/effects and way more music (composed by Stephen Sondheim). I think it would've worked better if, like ""Wizard,"" there was more dialogue and less song & dance, but that's just me. The great cast is more-than-up for the task, however, and I like the black humor and message. The work by hundreds of talented people that went into pulling this film off is mind-boggling. And they DO pull it off. If you can't handle musicals, though, head for the hills.THE MOVIE RUNS 125 minutes and was shot in England. WRITERS: Stephen Sondheim & James Lapine. ADDITIONAL CAST: Christine Baranski plays Cinderella's evil stepmother and Tammy Blanchard & Lucy Punch her spoiled stepsisters.GRADE: B-"
" Beautiful bitter sweet story reflecting live
",0.6249,0.9509,2017-09-10 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a musical which reworks the plots of several fairy tails and weaves them into one plot. The original unrealistic sugar sweet plot of each fairy tail is slightly amended to reflect the realities of life. This yields a heart achingly beautiful movie about the human condition. The music is somewhat modern, but nonetheless accessible and at times moving. The acting is very good. I love this movie!"

It's about dark psycho-social issues, or in other words : everyone's real life (=the woods) horror. Considering the analogy it's a clever idea to make this as a fantasy-horror movie, that's why i give it two points instead of one. But plenty of this in real life, don't want to go watch a movie for this. It's also spread on a bit too thick for my taste. B.t.w. the singing is part of the horror to ;)."

This is a movie without a point, a wandering post-modern walkabout in the land of dramatic entropy. No, I did not mean irony, I meant entropy. The movie runs downhill and out of energy like the Heat Death of the universe predicted by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, only you don't have to wait eons of time to witness this entropic death, you get to see it after you have wasted about two hours of your time. The singing is awful, to boot. Truly cringe-worthy. Now I can finally sympathize with my kill-joy father. When my Mom would drag him off to the latest musical, he had a sixth sense about when the singing would start, and he would whisper ""Oh no, I think they're about to sing."" My reaction exactly to this movie. This movie outdoes many of the great turkeys like Cleopatra and Plan Nine From Outer Space."
" A very very bad story
",-0.6214,-0.0489,2017-07-23 00:00:00,4,"In a fantastical and magical world, a couple of classic fairy tales collide in an live action attempt to create something unique. Rapunzel's mother wants her beauty back so she tasks a baker to bring her what she needs in exchange for removing his family's curse. In the meantime, Cinderella, Red Riding Hood and Jack (the one with the bean stalk) have plans of their own in relation with the main story.It's a movie which tried to create something interesting but ended up with a huge pile of rubbish. It tried to be a comedy and a musical but failed miserably in both genres, laughter and musical delight being out of the question. Although it had an interesting cast, to say the least, it tried to tell a sub-mediocre story, but everything went in any direction, except the designated one. It makes you feel that you are watching a very low budget parody, with no clear purpose, which ultimately leads to a retarded finale which simply makes no sense (as the whole movie).It's bad in every possible way, its mere existence being a huge question for me, let alone why its cast accepted to play in such a misery."
" Somehow a good musical adaptation from Broadway but with muddled problem
",-0.3818,-0.9262,2017-07-21 00:00:00,7,"The Broadway musical adaptation into a movie got lost in some translation. Although, most of the members of the cast did a good job but Meryl Streep stands out as the highlight of this movie. Rob Marshall, no stranger to musicals had done a good directing of this movie too.What i didn't like was that, it was somehow rushed in which it didn't pay some honor to its source material in which the tone is problematic (it somehow light), plus the rape and adultery stuff is making this movie anxious and flabbergasted to viewers.Still, the good thing that Into the Woods has redeemable qualities, such as the costume and production designs as well Stephen Sondheim's musical score. At least it's epic but with muddled flaws."
" A musical can still capture your hearts in the modern day.
",0.0,0.9849,2017-07-21 00:00:00,8,"Into the woods is a great movie as it proves that when done right, a musical can still capture your hearts in the modern day. A true return to movies like: Mary Poppins and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, this film really shocked me with the story, acting and Shrek Esq feel. I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it and will recommend it to anyone. The songs are so catchy (especialy the title song) and performed so well by all the actors. And lets be honest, you cannot really go wrong when Meryl Streep is involved. For me I was pleasantly surprised at the story. It was not what I was expecting and I think that's the main reason why I enjoyed it so much. My only 2 issues are that the film could have been a bit shorter. It does feel too long. And that there is not really any in-depth character development. But hey, not every film is perfect. In Short I had a lot of fun and feel it's definitely worth a watch."
" Fine movie of this musical, but there are some badly mismatched voices
",-0.5789,0.9698,2017-06-17 00:00:00,8,"Yes, some changes are made in the stage version (surprise! that's what always happens when stage musicals are filmed), and some of those changes work better than others. And the music is wonderful—perhaps not quite Sondheim at his very best, but still creative, inventive, and memorable. The one issue that seriously detracts from the film is the mismatching of voices. The Brits (James Corden, Emily Blunt) sing like well-trained Lieder singers, with a smooth vocal quality that is well supported throughout the vocal range and an even vibrato. Some of the Americans (Anna Kendrick and especially Lilla Crawford) are Broadway belters, complete with flat vowels and intrusive vibrato—voices trained to be sung into mikes—always at the same high level of intensity and no tenderness whatsoever. It's not just a US vs. English thing, since some of the other Americans, notably Meryl Streep and Chris Pine, manage their voices quite well. But the four survivors of the story leave us with a vocal quartet that is wildly uneven. The two males, the Baker and Jack, have smooth well-modulated British voices; the two females, Cinderella and Red Riding Hood, in ensembles with them, are almost unlistenable. Did Marshall plan it like this? He must have, but it's hard to see why."
" Delightfully non-Disney, but not great (or even good)
",-0.4751,0.9665,2017-06-01 00:00:00,6,"""The woods are just trees, the trees are just wood,""or so the characters sing, trying to convince themselves that there is nothing to fear in the endless forest into which they all verdure. In fact the woods are as dour and creepy as is required for a fairy tale. Unfortunately some of that bleakness seeps into the personality of the whole movie.I give director Rob Marshall credit for not making a movie that is delightful and plushy or child pandering (as one would fear from a Disney Production.) As far as music goes, some numbers land and some don't. Red Riding Hood has the voice of An American Idol reject, And Jack's Cockney accent doesn't do him any favours on ""Giants in the Sky"". Merryl Streep fairs better, as does Anna Kendrick. Chris Pine does a nice satirical version of ""Agony"", in which he busts out his pecs in the bright sunlight. The movie needs more sunlight.It also needs more humour. A lot of the musical's memorable one liners get lost in these woods. Everyone takes themselves too seriously. As the movie unfolds, a feeling starts to emerge that the production was either being stingy with money or didn't have enough. I wasn't expecting to see glitter or gloss everywhere, but the exterior of Prince Charming's castle looks as barren and prehistoric as Orson Welles' Macbeth. Johnny Deep as the wolf is just a guy with party store make up and rubber paws.In terms of acting the best performances are Emily Blunt and James Corden as the Baker and his wife. The story ends with the visually underwhelming slaying of the Giant's wife and the ghost of the slain baker's wife coming to comfort her husband. Marshall opts for the same kind of quiet last note as his film Nine. When it comes to musicals however, less is not more. I am relieved that this did not turn into a fiasco trying to outdo its source material. In fact it does the opposite. It ignores a number of aspects that made Into the Woods worthy of being source material in the first place."
" Loved it!

It's based on fairy tales, but more of the original versions which are kind of dark at times.I thought the costumes were beautiful. The sets were beautiful. The camera work was great.I loved the songs, although I admit I had to watch it twice to really enjoy them.I thought it was well acted and star studded."
" Phenomenal screen adaptation
",0.0,0.971,2017-05-16 00:00:00,8,"The fact that Sondheim was able to develop music for the stage play and then director Rob Marshall managed to adapt the play so well for the screen is, in and of itself, worth 5 stars out of the gate. But then add pitch perfect performances (another star), phenomenal sets (an additional star), cinematography (another), and wonderful orchestrations and this is an easy 8 out of 10. Reviewers who rate this a 1, are to be blunt, garbage people and need to be ignored. If you want to find a movie to rate a 1 go review a Fast and Furious movie or something. But this is a fantastic work of art and work and, at the very least, haters should appreciate the talent and care that went into this film. Into The Woods is actually not that listenable on stage because it's hard to separate the performances. Sondheim's music is so layered and antiphonal that it's difficult to follow when you see the show. But in the film, Marshall provides the texture the composer had in mind but radically improves the intelligibility of the lyrics and hence, the story-line. Given that the story itself is a little contrived, I can't give it a 10 like I would for a few other classic musicals, but then, I knew what to expect story-wise, going in. To give this a low rating because it was ""boring"" or the ""music wasn't good"" means you're not the target audience. That's all."
" If you're expecting a ""happy Disney musical"" this is not for you
",0.5719,0.9937,2017-05-11 00:00:00,9,"It is genuinely amazing how many people out there don't read anymore, as based on the huge number of negative reviews, many users 1) didn't know it was a musical; 2) didn't know it was on Broadway 30 years ago (and numerous times since); 3) got their knickers in a twist over the more ""adult"" material (faithful to the play and often right out of Grimm) and the more somber tone in Act II, and 4) hate the score. Going down the list: Yes, ""Into the Woods"" is a musical, but it was written by Stephen Sondheim (""Sweeney Todd"" ""Company"" ""Follies""), not Alan Mencken and co. It's supposed to be challenging music with lyrics that ask tough, hard questions about life, happiness, ambiguity, and ""happily ever after."" If you want simpler versions of these stories with more ""hummable"" songs, rent the other Disney versions. And yes, as it goes along, ""Into the Woods"" basically deconstructs fairy tale conventions by asking real-world queries: why is there suffering? Why does a ""good person"" die, but a ""bad"" person gets away with their behavior? Can you love someone and still be tempted by others? Etc. As far as the other more ""adult"" material: any Children's Lit course worth its salt references Bruno Bettelheim and his seminal work ""The Uses of Enchantment""--the interplay between Red and the Wolf is apiece with that. (And really, squawking about the ""violence"" in the Cinderella story? Again, go to the source material.) As a lover of the show, I could carp about a couple things (losing the princes' reprise of ""Agony""), but this is about as faithful and honorable an adaptation as one could ask of such a challenging, thorny show. You want an unchallenging, ""happy"" kids' musical? Go rent ""Annie."" For musical film lovers, ""Into the Woods"" may be the nerviest, most ambitious and unsettling musical since ""Cabaret""--and that's meant as praise."

Anna Kendrick and Hames Corden are hilarious people so it's good to see them doing things that expose their talents. 3. I've heard the all of the music on it was really good.It was enjoyable especially in the first act. The only thing that wasn't amazing was parts in the second act. I felt that parts could have been more dramatic such as how the affair between the bakers wife and the prince and how trounces leaving effected the witch.Other than that it was really good and I recommend it!

Production- wise.....yeah, it's really not that good. But, story-wise...God, so much F@#$%'n SINGING!!!!! And I actually think that the soundtrack did this play more justice than this god-awful movie did.

Leaving a lot of questions and unfulfilled stories unless there is a second movie to explore this.1) The baker and Rapunzel were siblings separated at a very young age. In the movie they never had any interaction nor did they ever seem to want to find each other.2) After Charming and the baker's wife had it going in the woods, Cinderella breaks up with him and in the end agrees to stay with the baker. Did they fall in love? There was nothing that seemed like a love connection between the baker and Cinderella. But she did wish for a life somewhere ""in between""- referencing to the life she used to have (with the evil step-mom and sisters) and her dream life (as a princess). I'm so confused.3) Why the heck did the witch disappear into the ground...4) Mr. Wolf seemed to be more of a paedophile than an actual wolf unless of course the story refers to the original (17th century) version of the tale in which Mr. wolf was an actual person who raped LRRH.I would listen to the soundtrack!"
" I knew what to expect, and it gave me more.
",0.0,0.9975,2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,"I almost missed this movie forever because of the bad reviews, I postponed it and thought maybe I wouldn't see it, but it came into my hands and I thought to give it 20 minutes and judge if it was worth it, or if I would leave it halfway as it happened with Mama Mía. Then I found out it was delivering exactly what I could expect from it, and well done also. Who can ask for anything more these days? I see all the really bad ratings were expecting something different. Either is too Sondheim for them, or too Disney. Well, it is a Sondheim musical adapted for Disney. They didn't hide any of that, did they? it's a compromised job,short of in between of nowhere, but that's what they sold. I mean, you know what McDonald's is, if you want a great prime rib meat you wouldn't go there, and if you despise meat you wouldn't either. But if you know what you are looking for and it's what they sell, it's perfectly all right to go.I knew it couldn't be really true to Sondheim, because Disney wouldn't have produced it, and probably not any big budget studio. So I expected a lot of losses. I would have paid for a truer version, but millions wouldn't. So it couldn't be made in this world.I knew it wasn't a family movie, because why bother adapting this play into a family movie? it would be like trying to adapt the novel 1984 into a family movie.So it could only be what it is. And being that, I think it's a bold effort and a passionate work from the director and the actors, I hope they were prepared for the insulting reviews and the disappointment of the public, because I think they don't deserve it, but they would know it could happen. I feel grateful that they did this movie, It left me wanting to watch the play which I think it's a great thing, doing some homage to an original work and carrying people to the original. The first act is really enjoyable, I was thrilled to see it was done with flawless performances and real emotions. It is true that the second act loses interest. But even so, they made a great job considering they had to cut most of the play's strongest ""punches"". For me, the music was perfectly performed and produced, it really gave me the multiple emotions that a Sondheim musical delivers. It is also true that since I was expecting the worst movie ever, it easily surpassed my expectations. Some great movies you love them without knowing anything in advance, this isn't one of those movies.Please, keep doing these movies, keep taking risks and bring us works that many of us won't understand. There are already too many works that won't make anyone uncomfortable. And if you know a couple of Sondheim pays, and you enjoy them, but you understand the compromises cinema has to make to please producers (and sell). Watch this, it's worth it. I give it a 9, because I'm so offended it has a 6 (It may be an 8 movie)."
" Terrible adaptation, confusing due to plot cuts
",-0.7351,-0.7927,2017-01-08 00:00:00,2,"Terrible. I grew up watching the professionally filmed Broadway musical with the original cast. As for the people who are complaining about the pedophile undertones, um, yes, that is the point. In the original Broadway musical the wolf costume included an anatomically correct penis, just waving around on stage. The story of red riding hood is a metaphor to warn children about predators. All of the terrible things that happen to these characters are actually true to the plots of the original fairy tales. However, this was a terrible adaptation. I expected new actors to make the songs their own and have slightly different inflection, etc. The meaning of most songs was just totally lost. For example, the Baker and his wife in ""It Takes Two"": they have no chemistry. This is supposed to be a very deep and moving song about a couple evolving to a cooperative partnership, instead they are doing somersaults and just singing at each other. The whole moral of the story is lost as they cut out critical parts of the plot. Also, the set reminded me of the swamp in the Princess Bride. I just can't say enough bad things about this version, I would need pages to write them all."
" Not a musical, not really a saga
",0.0,0.9646,2017-01-08 00:00:00,5,"Sure there are some positives about this movie. The premise is great and to some extent it all falls together beautifully. But I have some complaints.The biggest problem is the voice/role of the storyteller. It is supposed to tie everything together. But for me it is annoying only. Extend the movie by 30 minutes and make proper bridges in the story. Secondly, there is not enough singing. Compare with Mamma Mia (2008) or Les Misearbles (2012) which is singing only, this is somewhat around 50/50. Not a proper musical. And some of the songs are somewhat bland. I would prefer the non-trained voices of Pierce Brosnan or Rusell Crowe if they come with engaging numbers. Meryl Streep is good, but better in Mamma Mia (2008). Anna Kendrick is perfect by all accounts. So are Emily Blunt, Lilla Crawford and Chris Pine. Johnny Depp is sadly typecast.The ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" story line is not properly developed. Nor is the ""Cinderella""-story line. The mere adding of some dialogue here and there (not the voice over though) would have sufficed. As it stands, the story takes too big leaps occasionally.The voice of the storyteller is not ""saga"" enough. It is too modern and would have benefited from a more mature male or female voice. The voice of Dame Maggie Smith would have been much preferred. Or Ian McKellen or some other classically trained actress/actor. Now, the voice over is provided by James Corden. He is good in his role, but his voice does not suffice for the story teller.I would have been glad to recommend the movie. But sadly, don't prioritize it if you are not a solid fan of Disney movies. The visuals are top notch though!"
