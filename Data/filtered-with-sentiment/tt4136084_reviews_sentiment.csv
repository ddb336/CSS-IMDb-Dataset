" Ugh!
",-0.4753,-0.9361,2021-03-30 00:00:00,1,"There are certain female actors that are poison, and everyone knows who they are: Emma Thompson, Renee Zwell/Zell/Wegger...Keira KaNightly...and at the top of this list is the extremely terrible Ms Streep, who's performances cause one to wake up from a nightmare where one was ACTUALLY cast in the latest kenneth branagh windbag cinema...and...allowing oneself to appear in such trite doings as this piece of warped celluloid alongside such a venomous spider as Ms Streep is a career ender...(maybe its about time to retire to the south of France and chase the tourist chicks on the beach Hughie baby...)
With that said, we made it through about half of this debacle when one of our number asked, ""why in the name of Samuel Goldwyn are we subjecting our souls to this dreadful debacle posing as an actual cinematic offering?""
As no one in our vast number could answer that, we chose to retire to our crib and wash the foul taste out of our systems with a generous dose of Johnny Blue Walker...
So naturally, 3 questions need answering regarding this immense waste of time:1-Why did anyone think this this pig's foot need to be made?2-Who was the horrible human being that ruined Hugh Grant's career by talking him into this
3-Are we indeed certain Spike Lee was not involved in this production?"
" Laugh and Cry
",0.128,0.9267,2021-03-24 00:00:00,8,"This movie exceeded my expectations, and made me laugh and cry. Florence Foster Jenkins celebrated life and music/song despite it all, with the help/protection/care of her devoted husband (who may come across as a jerk in the beginning, but as the story unfolds the viewer realizes the depth of his devotion and love for Florence)."
" Streep is magnificent!
",0.636,0.9804,2021-02-23 00:00:00,10,If anybody had told me I would enjoy an opera film I would have told them they're dreaming! But I don't remember having laughed so much for many years. Streep is absolutely magnificent and carries the show. To sing as off key as she does is a mighty performance and leads to many of the comedic moments. Hugh Grant is also great as her husband who has to keep the truth from Florence.I really enjoyed this and give it a big fat 10/10.. .
" Moving in more ways than one.
",0.0,0.4312,2021-02-08 00:00:00,9,"I wasn't expecting much from this film save for a chuckle then and now, but I received so much more. It is refreshing to see a unique story like Foster Jenkins' brought to the screen, and in a riveting manner at that. Hilariously inspiring, I could not stop the smiles or heartbreak that came with this movie."
" Sing like no one can hear you!
",0.1511,0.991,2021-01-09 00:00:00,6,"I do like this one. It makes me giggle and it has a charm to it, helped by the beautiful sets, costumes and props.The cast are fantastic. You can always expect Meryl's best (Unless you're watching Ricki & The Flash) and once again she proves as versatile as ever.
Hugh Grant is the roguishly handsome Brit again, but he finds a new way to make it fresh and steals most of the screen time to give a great impassioned performance.
And Simon Helberg. Well, he plays a character very different from his portrayal of Howard in 'The Big Bang Theory'. A closeted pianist who suffers greatly at the hands of his patron despite her having no knowledge about it. I wonder if his counterpart in real life was gay or if that was just put in for this version?The true story actually fascinates me as a result of this film. Florence must have been a remarkable woman and the few tidbits I have found in the IMDB trivia have proved interesting.I think I would have liked to have been around to see these times and be a part of the experience shown. I might have given Cosme a good time for a ticket to the Carnegie show or a copy of the vinyl?"
" Surprisingly wonderful
",0.7096,0.6808,2020-12-20 00:00:00,10,Did not expect to be so enthralled in an older lady who thought she could sing. The true life story is just as inspiring as this movie.
" Perfect Afternoon Matinee with a Grandparent
",0.5719,0.9969,2020-11-02 00:00:00,6,"Florence Foster Jenkins is the latest Meryl Streep movie and is directed by Stephen Frears, and stars Hugh Grant and Simon Helberg alongside Streep. This film tells the story of Florence Foster Jenkins, a real life wealthy women in the 1940's who had a passion for the art of music and thought she was a great singer. Now I'll be honest this isn't a film for me, it's definitely intended for an older audience, and I'm sure that age-group would get a lot of enjoyment out of this movie. First of all slower movies, that are based on true stories, similar to this do intrigue me, their not my favourite thing in the world but some of them are quite good and can be entertaining. Sadly, Florence Foster Jenkins never met that level for me and I'd be lying if I said I didn't get bored at times through this film. I did want to like it and though it did give me a good chuckle every now and then, this wasn't my favourite film ever due to its slowness. However the acting in this film is fantastic, Meryl Streep delivers as come to expect and is probably going to be up for another Oscar nomination after this film. I enjoyed Hugh Grant as her husband who desperately hides the truth of Florence's singing from her. However the standout for me in this film is Simon Helberg, who is best known as Howard Wolowitz on the hit show, The Bang Theory. Here he plays Florence's pianist and felt like his performance best represents the attitude and feelings of the audience as the events around him unfold. Overall this won't be a film I may watch again but I do appreciate some things it had to offer, especially the message of passion interfering with the truth. This is a well structured movie and though it wasn't always intriguing, Florence Foster Jenkins gets a 6/10."
" Hilariously funny during the voice rehearsals
",0.4404,0.9758,2020-09-29 00:00:00,7,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the comedy drama Florence Foster Jenkins (2016) starring the queen herself Meryl Streep who portrays the title character Florence Foster Jenkins, a New York heiress who dreamed of becoming an opera singer and play at Carnegie Hall, however her voice isn't that great. Her husband played by Hugh Grant, supports her dreams and her dreams to perform at Carnegie Hall becomes a truly historic eventStreep's performance is on point again playing Florence, we see a woman who has defied medical science by living well beyond the usual lifespan of a syphilis victim, which is a disease she contracted on marrying when she was 18 years old. Her physical performance of chronic exhaustion while trying to fulfill her dreams is amazing. Both Streep and Grant are superb in their parts and their chemistry together is wonderful. What enhances the movie is when Florence recruits the help of a young pianist who early on is aware of what he is in for however goes with the charade. I was literally laughing during the voice rehearsals, but also feeling sad for someone who was trying to pursue a dream, which at the start looked to be beyond her reach. A very moving and at times wildly funny storytelling - overall 7.8/10"
" Sad and Touching
",-0.4767,-0.208,2020-07-25 00:00:00,9,"Poor little rich old lady. The dvd case says that this film is ""hilarious"". However I could not detect anything funny about it. True, there were extensive scenes of people laughing at Florence, but I didn't laugh myself. I just felt sorry for her.There are two kinds of English-speaking actors: British, and American. British actors act. That is to say, like Gary Oldman, Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers, Larry Olivier, they disappear into their roles. American actors don't act. They speak their lines, more or less convincingly, but their personalities, good or bad, stay the same, and are always familiarly recognisable. The exception that proves this rule is Meryl Streep. She can act. She disappears into her role; never more so than in this present instance, but also in many other film parts. Her performance as Florence Foster is both moving and sublime.Florence's victimisation as a 17 year old, by her despicable first husband, Frank Thornton Jenkins, who was twice her age, totally blighted her future life. Her life nevertheless reminds me of the ABBA song: ""it's a rich man's world"". The loyal support steadily provided by Bayfield and McMoon would doubtless have been well rewarded.Florence is shown to be in dedicated pursuit of musical immortality, which, once gained, was to be dramatically followed by death, like Parvulesco said. Five days after her spectacular achievement of a sold-out concert at Carnegie Hall, seating 4,000, Florence Jenkins suffered a heart attack , and died soon afterwards, aged 76. It is extremely difficult to believe that she did not know what she sounded like.This disturbing film is created by the wonderful director Stephen Frears, who is known for his odd choices in storylines and who debuted with an odd snitch movie, called ""the Hit"". I would like to give this movie ten stars, but I do find it somewhat melancholic and depressing, and therefore deduct one star."
" An utterly delightful film you can't help but smile at.
",-0.1895,0.5609,2020-07-11 00:00:00,7,"'Florence Foster Jenkins' finds what's so odd and wonderful about a woman who had absolutely no vocal talent and blissfully unaware of it. It is filled with feel-good pleasures and remarkable performances from Meryl Streep, Hugh Grant, Simon Helberg, to Rebecca Ferguson. The result is an utterly delightful film you can't help but smile at."
" Funny but also touching
",0.2382,0.9776,2020-06-12 00:00:00,6,"Sometimes funny and sometimes touching, the film tells the story of a wealthy patron of the arts and would be opera singer FFJ. She's so bad she's hilarious but, because she's surrounded by sychophantic admirers who appear to be after her money, the shoddy state of the emperess's new clothes is never exposed, until she decides to invite thousands of war heroes to a concert at Carnegie Hall. I found it funny in parts, although not quite as hilarious as some reviewers have claimed. Meryl Streep is pretty good as the wife hiding a health secret that partly explains her husband's infidelities but, for me Hugh Grant steals the show as the fawning husband who initially seems to be a heel only after her money, but is later revealed to have a rather more complicated relationship with his wife. By the end of the film it seems that he really does love her, despite her follies."
" More of an engaging tragedy than a comedy but Meryl Streep puts her heart and soul into it.
",-0.0305,0.3744,2020-01-03 00:00:00,7,"I think there are two ways to look at this film. One can look at it as a serious critique on the life of FFJ and as such it fails badly; it pays scant regard to the physical and mental illnesses she suffered and trivialises her true ""story""; the other is to consider it a fact-based piece of entertainment. On that score, it fares rather better as a gentle, performance-driven comedy with a tragic outcome. In either scenario, one cannot deny that Meryl Street delivers wonderfully as the women the newspapers described as ""the worst singer in the world"". Hugh Grant and Simon Helberg are good in the supporting roles as her manager and accompanist. The extent to which they were manipulatively complicit in the whole web of lies and deceit is never going to be truly known, but both seem more carried along by her belief in herself and her singing and the sheer weight of her personality than by any malevolence and/or greed in this film. Either way, it's Meryl at her most captivating and well worth a watch."
" Shameful
",-0.4939,-0.3612,2019-12-28 00:00:00,6,"I was looking forward to seeing this film. But I was disappointed. It was a shameful attack on a woman who was limited in ability but passionate about the arts and did everything she could to be part of it. Overcoming a lifetime of struggle.. this film showed none of that and continued to pick fun at her. Florence should be remembered as an inspiration. This film did nothing to tell her real story, such a shame considering the high calibre actors."
" Unspoilt by Failure
",-0.5106,0.2846,2019-12-26 00:00:00,8,"Real life means constantly suffering fools gladly if they hold the pursestrings; and money means people are always tactful around you and at least pretend to listen whenever you open your mouth.Everybody is always the soul of discretion to Madame Florence's face about what they really think about the singing ability of grand opera's answer to William McGonagall - gamely played by Meryl Streep - in this tragicomic reinvention of 'Stella Dallas', 'Citizen Kane' and 'Ed Wood'."
" Room for improvement

" Not a comedy?????
",0.0,-0.8906,2019-12-07 00:00:00,8,I haven't laughed so hard in years!!! So insane that Ms Jenkins had NO IDEA she was SO HORRIBLE. Bravo to Meryl Streep for pulling this part off so brilliantly and accurately!!! Ta da!!!!!
" Not a comedy..
",0.0,-0.5886,2019-10-09 00:00:00,9,.. But I haven't laughed this hard in a LONG time. Literally had my crying with laughter.
" ""Music is, and has been, my life!""
",0.0,0.9941,2019-07-19 00:00:00,8,"The most incredible thing about this film is that it was based on a true story and a real person. I was actually in awe that Meryl Streep could sing as badly as the film required to make it's point that Jenkins was not only tone deaf, but was able to tune out the taunts and jeers that accompanied her performances. On the flip side, I couldn't get over how commendable a companion St Clair Bayfield (Hugh Grant) was in supporting Florence's desire to bring her voice to the attention of the masses. They say it takes 'practice, practice, practice' to make your way to Carnegie Hall, but Jenkins did it with perseverance and money, and a considerable enough ego to believe that she had what it takes to perform for the public. I liked Simon Helberg in his role as Cosmé McMoon, Jenkins' accompanist on piano. Initially revolted and hysterical over her singing, McMoon was persuaded by Bayfield to be the good guy that he needed to be in order to fulfill Jenkins' outlandish pursuit. Together they managed to turn public disapproval on a dime with the help of quirky patrons like Agnes Stark (Nina Arianda), who's public defense of the singer turned a hostile military crowd into a cheering audience. You get the feeling that much of the picture is done tongue in cheek except for the fact that all the principals do their earnest best to shield Jenkins from criticism. When it finally dawns on Florence that her singing career was all a mirage, she managed to accept it with good grace, and an admission that ""People may say I couldn't sing, but no one can say I didn't sing""."
" Just okay
",0.2263,-0.2183,2019-05-04 00:00:00,4,"I didn't bother watching this film in theaters because it's not my cup of tea, and frankly, while I think Meryl Streep has done a lot of great work over the decades she's been acting, she's kind of been overrated in the last several years with her annual Oscar nominations. She does do a great job of capturing the eccentricities of Florence Foster Jenkins, and you do believe she does think she can sing well enough to perform.
But that's where the story itself kind of falls flat. Her singing is bad, her husband while devoted to her, also has a side 'gig' going, and Florence herself and times is very stubborn and unwilling to compromise. Some people may find that endearing, I found it frustrating and irritating.
Ultimately her personality is one reason why I ended up not caring whether she felt good or bad, and I'm not sure if this movie missed the mark in terms of trying to 'inspire' those who don't quite have what it takes, to keep trying. My take away was more like, it's okay to have a hobby that you're reasonably good at, but you need to listen to the criticisms if you're not that good lol. The movie doesn't really have any plot or energy, it pretty much goes along at the same pace, and is a by-the-textbook telling of her life. This happens, then this happens, then this happens, and so forth.
So if you have elderly parents or grandparents, this might be an enjoyable weekend afternoon movie to watch with them. Otherwise, it's one you can skip, because you won't feel much reward for having viewed it."
" Great film
",0.6249,0.8518,2019-04-24 00:00:00,10,"I was tempted to say - it's Meryl Streep and leave it at that, she is an icon and one of the greats, after all. Anyway I checked out the life of Florence Foster Jenkins after watching the film and the film is pretty accurate. The acting is, of course superb, the sets wonderful and for any serious movie goer, it's a treat. I was moved between tragedy and laughter, some of the scenes are incredibly funny, but there is a sadness about her character that pervades the film.Basically a wonderful film"
" In this one Streep is outplayed by Frot in Marguerite (2015)
",0.0,0.9266,2019-04-23 00:00:00,5,"In this one Streep is outplayed by Frot in Marguerite (2015)I found the movie quite average. Maybe it takes less liberties at the facts behind, but as result the movie IMO lacks of an catching story. Also the presence of Meryl Streep is of no help here, for once a quite unconvincing performance.
The very same story about Jenkins, with some adaptations however, was took up in the french movie Marguerite (2015). Where Catherine Frot delivered a much more appealing acting, as well as that movie was better scripted and more entertaining."
" It makes your heart go out to Florence Foster Jenkins
",0.0,0.9718,2019-03-11 00:00:00,8,"I think this is a great, tender movie, but a very sad and melancholic one. There are funny moments, of course, but it is more moving than funny. More or less faithful to the true story of Florence Foster Jenkins, this movie evokes emotions of compassion and tenderness. Mrs Jenkins seems to have been a kind and generous soul in many respects. Unfortunately, she was also ill-treated, especially by her first husband, who gave her syphilis when she was just a young girl. It caused her a lot of grief. Perhaps it also made it impossible for her to hear that her singing was flawed. It is still debated whether she believed she was a great singer or not. Watching this movie, one fears the moment when she will be hurt."
" Full of charm, humor, and heart
",0.5859,0.974,2019-02-07 00:00:00,7,"This movie will win you over much the way that Meryl Streep's Florence Foster Jenkins' character wins you over. You will laugh, but never quite AT Florence Foster Jenkins because she has such a good heart that her obliviousness is ultimately a large part of her charm. Truly a delight from start to finish."
" Good
",0.4404,0.8316,2019-02-05 00:00:00,7,I enjoyed it. Cute story and leaves you with a smile.
" A Sweet and Genuine Story
",0.4588,0.9973,2019-01-13 00:00:00,7,"""Florence Foster Jenkins"" may not be the flashiest film of all time, but it is sure to warm the heart.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The story is one filled with genuine heart. It is not complex or showy, it simply tells the story of a husband and wife who love each other and love music, and a curious young man who grows to love the two of them. Director Stephen Frears captures nice performances from his cast and brings a beautiful story to life. *Editing/Cinematography: Nothing too special in either of these categories. They do their part to make the film work. *Dialogue/Acting: While this is somewhat of an awkward film, there are still some great moments of acting, especially when things turn more serious. Hugh Grant and Meryl Streep deliver solid performances, as does Simon Helberg. There are some very cathartic moments of dialogue that give us a sense of fulfillment and happiness. *Music/Sound: Part of the story is that Florence is an awful singer, which makes some of the music horrible in this film, but it makes the story better for it. The sound design is pretty strong throughout the film, despite a few weaknesses in some scenes. *Production Design/Special Effects: The set pieces and wardrobe are fitting for the time period and do not raise any concern, but they are not particularly eye catching.*Conclusion: Overall, ""Florence Foster Jenkins"" is a heartwarming film that is great for family movie night, and is sure to have everyone laughing and tearing up."
" Streep At Her Finest - Per Usual
",0.0,0.9923,2018-10-25 00:00:00,9,"My God. Meryl Streep TRULY can play any role. I have never seen an actor fully immerse themselves in to so many roles. I didn't think I would even like this movie, but my love for Streep won out and I finally gave it a watch. I am so glad I did. She totally escapes in to this role, this life, this world - and so did I. Awesome performance. AGAIN! Hugh Grant was splendid as well."
" Entertaining but loses much of the complexity available
",-0.25,-0.3612,2018-10-18 00:00:00,6,"I think describing FFJ as ""the worst singer ever"" is unimaginative and also missleading. She was after all someone who took the probably enormous trouble to learn arias that would take great skill and technique to master. They are not easy to sing ""badly"", or to even get through at all. Consequently Meryl Streep's vocal performance here is amazing. But the film shows some lack of imagination as well: how about the mystery of how aware Jenkins really was of the quality of her singing, which could hardly be described on a simple axis from bad to good? Also, wasn't Jenkins herself active in creating her own little bubble of audience and her public persona? Here, St Clair Bayfield is shown as single-handedly managing and protecting her, which creates a dynamic both troubling and simplistic."
" Very sweet
",0.5095,0.6506,2018-09-15 00:00:00,8,A very lovely and touching movie. Thoroughly enjoyed it. How could you not love Florence?
" Not a comedy, a rather sad tale
",0.1139,0.9517,2018-08-09 00:00:00,10,I've seen this film twice now and I love it. The cast is perfect and the filming brilliant. A real story of illness and true love.

",0.6581,0.893,2018-07-26 00:00:00,6,"I laughed until the end! The storyline was very well put together and it was an unexpected ending. I loved the controversy between certain characters who's flaws clashed, making the story move along."
" Wonderful fun!
",0.807,0.9798,2018-07-24 00:00:00,9,From the moment it began it was just too much fun for just 1 person to have. I love Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant is aging well. The story is great fun and the singing is even more fun! Watch it to have a real laugh!
" I've done it! I've found a good film with Hugh Grant!...
",0.5399,0.9734,2018-05-18 00:00:00,8,"I've done it! I've found a good film with Hugh Grant!... maybe even a great film! A hysterically debauched demonstration of decadence, farce and touching dedication. Streep is magnificent, Howard from The Big Bang is fantastic. Laugh out loud heart warming brilliance from beginning to end!"
" Enjoyable to a degree
",0.4404,0.9937,2018-04-24 00:00:00,6,"Based on a true story: in 1944, the title character (played by Meryl Streep) is wealthy patroness of the arts in New York. She has a chaste marriage to St Clair Bayfield (Hugh Grant) who has a secret relationship on the side but adores Florence to the point of being co-dependent. He and others encourage her to take singing lessons and perform despite the fact that she cannot sing.There is a charm and entertainment value in this movie and how can it not be considering the talent involved. In addition to engaging performances by Streep and Grant (plus Simon Helberg as Florence's pianist accompanist), the movie is well directed by the brilliant and seasoned Stephen Frears (""My Beautiful Launderette"", ""Dangerous Liaisons"", ""The Grifters"", ""The Queen"", ""Philomena"").To take on this true story is quite challenging. As fiction, it would be easily dismissed as unbelievable. Yet again, truth is stranger than fiction here. While the viewer is taken through the events, we are given too little information about St Clair and others for setting Florence up for possible humiliation. She seems spared by her naivete and some occasional sitcom-like attempts to keep the truth from her.It's hard to pin down what exactly is missing in a movie with such potential. Maybe, it needed an approach that is at least as surreal as the story itself. Plus more understanding of some very unusual characters. By the end, it felt like it could only go so far despite the talent involved."
" Meryl Streep? Say no more.
",-0.296,0.9657,2018-02-26 00:00:00,8,"Meryl Streep is great in this movie. I'm always amazed at how she can become ANY character and has such top notch performances in every movie that I've ever seen her in. Even if the movie sucks, she is great. Luckily that isn't the case here. This movie does not suck. Indeed, it's quite a good movie.As for the other actors, Hugh Grant is surprisingly likable and fits well into his role, while Simon Helberg (who I find to be one of the funniest actors on The Big Bang Theory) has a passable one-note performance.The plot doesn't quite go the way you expect, in a good way. I was expecting the main ""gag"" to get increasing creditworthy and unfunny as the movie went on, but no, of course that would never happen with Meryl Streep. The movie hits some emotional notes along the way and all in all is a satisfying watch with a lot of heart."
" Great biopic
",0.6249,0.8126,2017-12-29 00:00:00,8,Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant give memorable performances about arguably one of the worst singers of all time. The film is intriguing in how protected Florence was from knowing the truth and the bonds she had with her assistant and husband.A great film and real treat to watch. 8/10
" Unexpectedly deep and surprisingly related to my life
",0.296,0.9951,2017-12-14 00:00:00,8,"What one could expect from a movie about high society of 1950s? Well, at least I didn't expect too much as it is not about anything close to my life and what I am interested in. Maybe I expected some entertaiing comedy, maybe some funny contadictions, maybe (actually certainly) some good Maryl Streep acting. Not that bad but not much honestly.And right from the start it all moved close to that. Some funny moments? Yes. Good acting? Certainly. Some sympathy for the Meryl's and Hugh's characters? Well, yes. Some questions and little secrets? Yes too.But then... I don't know how that happened but it quicky became so deeply dramatic and thrilling. And Carnegie Hall scene was just mind blowing. How can anyone react to Florence's performance and other events on the screen? Well maybe feel embarassed, maybe laugh. But me and my wife cried. And this contadiction between what was happening and what we felt was beautiful.From that scene on the movie continued as a solid drama with thriller elements. Touching deep inside me, my values, my real life challenges... I would compare its edge to Saving Mr. Banks and maybe even to Birdman.Florence Foster Jenkins have totally beaten my expectations. And I'm so happy with that!"
" Florence Foster Jenkins: Sad song
",-0.4767,0.9933,2017-12-11 00:00:00,7,"Florence Foster Jenkins stars Meryl Streep as Florence Foster Jenkins Hugh Grant as St. Clair Bayfield and Simon Maxwell Helberg as Cosmé McMoon in this biographical comedy drama about the worst singer in the world: Florence Foster Jenkins.The story simple enough, Florence Jenkins and St.Clair Bayfield are a happily married, wealthy couple in 1944 America who enjoy a love of music and all the good things in life. When Florence decides she wants to sing St.Clair agrees and before he knows it she becomes convinced that she can sing well despite reality and pushes her voice further and further into the public eye. The story is well told, if not a little slow at first until the third act where the pacing suddenly speeds up towards the climax and end. The writing is funny enough for the most part but is able to be more grounded should the situation demand it. I can't help but feel that Cosmé McMoon is a little two to one dimensional in the fact that he spends most if not all of his time on screen looking really nervous and upset. I can see what director Stephen Frears and writer Nicholas Martin were going for, it just seems that Simon Helberg is not given mach else asides from looking deeply scared and stuttering his lines. How much of it is the actors fault and how much is in the writing I cannot be really sure but I do suspect that it is the latter.To go into a movie with Meryl Streep expecting a bad performance can easily be seen as a lost cause, she not only captures a woman who is upbeat and hopeful with a love of music and opera but is deluded into thinking that she can sing even though every time she sings a cat dies a gruesome harrowing death off screen. Meryl Streep is able to play the more quirky personality traits Florence but is able to make you feel very sorry for her as well when less pleasant aspects of her life become apparent. The ending its self is really powerful thanks to Meryl Streep acting her way through it. She keeps everyone engaged and I doubt there would have been a better person to play Florence Jenkins. Hugh Grant is also fantastic, being able to shake off the shackles of his Rom Com days and really make St.Clair Bayfield his own, Grant convinced me the love Bayfield has for Florence Jenkins is real. Hugh Grant makes Bayfield feel like a real person and that deserves to be praised. I would not say that the film is particularly funny, that is not to say that there are no laughs in this for there certainly are but I can't help but feel that the film is more of a tragedy. I will not spoil but the film does make me feel really sorry for Florence Jenkins, I am sure the film wants me to feel bad for her but it does not flow with the themes of friendship vs. profit, and following your dreams against all odds.

" Florence Foster Jenkins presents a spectacle: herself!
",0.0,0.9913,2017-10-26 00:00:00,8,"Back in 2005, the Broadway play ""Souvenir"" documented the rehearsals for a concert at Carnagie Hall and the relationship between Ms. Jenkins and her piano player. Jenkins sang like a chicken being boiled alive but thought she sounded like an angel. For Tony winning actress Judy Kaye, she believed that her rendition of ""Ave Maria"" could induce tears, and after 90 minutes of laughing at the denial of the wealthy New York socialite, I was in tears. Somehow in that period of time, I began to love Florence rather than pity her, because indeed inside, she had heart, and truly sang with the passion of a Metropolitan Opera diva.Now it's Meryl Streep's turn, and the New York atmosphere of 1944 is superbly presented. At a time when dancing sailors took over the city in ""On the Town"", Barbara Stanwyck plotted to kill her husband, Tallulah Bankhead fished with diamonds in the middle of the Atlantic and Judy Garland sang on a trolley, Jenkins brought opera to society in a way it had never been heard. Hughes Grant plays her younger husband (possibly bigamous) who hides from her how awful she is. As a person, Jenkins is needy, affectionate, slightly snooty and becomes sort of a mother figure to her obviously gay piano player Simon Helberg who comes to appreciate her as he spends private time with her.In a sense, Jenkins became a folk hero of sorts, with music patrons deaf to her off key warbling and wounded soldiers influenced by her music. Grant and Helberg are both outstanding, and once again, Streep immerses herself in the part, sort of a singing Julia Child. This shows the real Jenkins at her best and worst, bald as a billiard ball and complaining about syphilis scars she got on the night of her first marriage. If untalented as untalented can be, she at least tried to go for her dreams, and if in denial of her talent at least had the soul to sing from. That in itself makes this movie worth while, coming in an era when dreams die faster than the latest fad and cynicism destroys the will to fully devote to one's goals."

" excellent!
",0.6114,0.96,2017-08-27 00:00:00,10,"In my youth, the name Florence Foster Jenkins was always a source of laughter as belonging to the world's worse soprano who had an inability to sing on pitch. (A case in point was her infamous attempt at singing the famous Queen of the Night aria, (""Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen"") I have not seen the other recent film ""Marguerite"" (2015) which was very loosely based on her career but this film is closer to her real life. For example, it turns out she was suffering from syphilis caught from her husband Dr. Frank Jenkins early on. So she was perhaps not completely in her right mind afterward.But she made the best of her life as she saw it.Meryl Streep plays Florence with her usual skill in another Oscar-worthy performance, Hugh Grant plays her ""sort-of-husband"" and manager St. Clair Bayfield (they avoided any conjugal relations by mutual agreement and he had his own real marriage.) and is a fine match for Streep.However, the big surprise is Simon Helberg (Wolowitz on The Big Bang theory) who plays the sorely-tried accompanist to Madame Jenkins, Cosmé McMoon,""McMunn"" originally, but that is not mentioned in this film.Although Helberg doesn't avoid McMoon's effeminate gestures, he doesn't overdo them either. (How about best-supporting actor?) Well-done all around!"
" A good film about a fascinating true story
",0.8481,0.9666,2017-08-22 00:00:00,7,"I'll admit, I thought that the premise of ""Florence Foster Jenkins"" (wealthy, tone-deaf, opera-singer-wannabee) was pretty thin high-concept until I found out that it was based on an actual person. Meryl Streep (and the film in general) does a good job of walking the thin line between the obvious broad-comedy of Florence's awful singing with the somewhat sad story of a women with medical (and perhaps mental) issues, who just wanted to live out her dream (and had a lot of cash, which helps). There seems little doubt that Jenkins contributed greatly to the music scene in New York, supported the U.S. troops, and was generally liked. Less clear (at least to me) is whether she was completely delusional about her singing prowess or whether she was ""in on the joke"" to some extent. I have heard some of her original recordings and she is terrible (and I couldn't tell an A-list opera star from a talented amateur), so whether she simply heard what she wanted to hear (as suggested in the movie) is open to debate. Streep is very good, as is Hugh Grant (in a perfect role for his standard British fop delivery), but as her pianist Cosmé McMoon, Simon Helberg, perhaps playing it a bit too close to his Big Bang Theory ""Howard"" character, was overly 'hammy' for my tastes. In the end, Jenkins' recordings sold well, but I don't know whether people bought them simply as novelty items or whether there was greater merit in her singing than the movie implies. In the fine arts greatness can come with changing tastes (Van Gogh is a classic example), but I'm not sure if that applies to opera."
" Delightfully Sweet Comedy
",0.8481,0.9777,2017-06-28 00:00:00,8,"A story of an aspiring opera singer with a screeching voice so horrible she could kill someone, Florence Foster Jenkins is so well done the story becomes film. It takes an expertise to craft a comedic story with love and hope and satire just as much as it takes expertise to sing as badly as Meryl Streep does. The flamboyant character imbues the screen with flamboyance and extravagance as every aspect of the film takes on those traits. However, the film is quite traditional with nothing that inspires greatness. So while it is an interesting and entertaining film, it isn't anything special.Streep turns in a magnificent performance as Jenkins. While the somewhat corny subject matter seems to provide her with a disadvantaged role, the seasoned actress turns it into an amazingly deep role of complex love, high hopes, and undying friendships. Additionally, Simon Helberg as the somewhat homosexual, awkward, and talented piano instructor delivers both a nice comedic relief and a means for the moral development of the characters.The screenplay demonstrates a high level of skill by describing both the levitating highs and tragic lows of the main character, while still encompassing the great character. To make both comedy and serious drama of the plight in the film is a tough task, but achieved well. There is a hint of satire to complement and round out the movie's edges. Yet the ending is delivered with the basic form of a feel-good movie, diminishing much of the effect built up throughout the film. A delightfully sweet comedy, but it just fails to deliver."
" Hopelessly Pedestrian
",-0.4939,0.0507,2017-05-24 00:00:00,5,"What's up with Stephen Frears? Every once in a while he delivers a really excellent little gem of a movie, like ""The Grifters"" or ""The Queen."" The rest of his time is spent concocting twee little trifles like ""Mrs. Henderson Presents"" or ""Florence Foster Jenkins,"" movies based on subjects that can barely sustain their running time.Everything in ""Florence Foster Jenkins,"" with the exception of Hugh Grant's performance, is pitched to clownish level. This applies to Meryl Streep's Oscar-nominated performance, which was really just Hollywood's way of thanking her for a blistering Golden Globes speech that year anyway. There may have been an interesting film to make of this society lady who was famous for being such a horrible singer. But Frears doggedly refuses to make anything more than a pedestrian, feel-good bit of fluff out of it. The worst victim of Frears' direction is poor Simon Helberg, who gives an unwatchably mannered performance as Florence's pianist.This film feels like it was made for the express purpose of being nominated for a Best Costume Design Oscar, which it dutifully was.Grade: C"
" Appallingly bad
",-0.7579,-0.9676,2017-05-22 00:00:00,1,"This was truly one of the worst movies I have seen this year. As a singer, listening to Meryl Streep singing off key for over 1.5 hours was just painful. Even worse than Mama Mia! I know terrible singing is part of the story, but as a singer myself, it was almost more than I could take. Couple this with a lame story line and fairly crummy performances by the other actors in the movie...and it just is pretty much a waste of time. Incredibly disappointing. I even went through the pain of setting up this account so I could warn other unsuspecting viewers to NOT watch this movie."
" A Touching Love Story about Riches
",0.8225,0.983,2017-05-17 00:00:00,10,"Meryl Streep can play any role. This is evident when you see her turn the story of a delusional heiress into a retelling of a tender romance. Florence Foster Jenkins, because she was so wealthy, could afford to pay people to praise her. Instead, she wanted to earn their adulation by singing great operatic arias. There may be reasons why she could not hear her own voice as clearly as others could. No excuses - she loved the music too much to think that her heart would not make up for any technical failings in the execution of song. The wonder is that the story becomes a love story, not an operatic 'Dumb and Dumber.' Hugh Grant's character, Florence's husband, at first seems to be a duplicitous continental gigolo. The viewer soon learns that this judgment is facile. Because this is a true story, it's impossible to say that the plot makes no sense. Of course it makes sense - in real life, some nonsense makes sense. Florence could have been a vain scatterbrained doyenne, blind to the feelings of the people around her. The scriptwriters make sure that you understand, eventually, that she is not that person. Getting to realize takes a gradual unfolding of the plot that makes you want to protect Mrs. Jenkins. Outwardly, she is a matron dressed with good taste and panache. Inwardly, she is a delicate flower. Meryl Streep shows this nicely."

They hire pianist Cosmé McMoon (Simon Helberg) to accompany Florence in her singing. He is shocked to find that it's bad. It's really bad. It's tone-deaf horrendous. St Clair shows real love for his wife but also has mistress Kathleen (Rebecca Ferguson). He engineers success for Florence's small concerts. Then she presses her own record and decides to play in Carnegie Hall.There are real emotions coming from Streep's performance. Her story is touching. Hugh Grant delivers a loving performance even as he hides his mistress. Florence's bad singing is funny and cute at first but it does wear thin. Eventually, it becomes an awkward watch. Helberg's performance does present a problem. He needs to be the straight man (not his sexual orientation). He should be the lens through which the audience sees Florence. It should be a more straight forward performance with less of the effeminate flourishes. Overall, this movie has some fun and surprisingly lots of heart."
" Cute inspiring movie based on true events
",0.8225,0.9983,2017-05-07 00:00:00,7,"Florence Foster Jenkins starring Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant has its entertaining moments and a lot of it is very inspiring. Florence's unwavering determination to sing is so admirable and it's entertaining to see her journey into singing and holding concerts. There were moments that had me bent over laughing at her horrendous singing, bless her heart she was trying so hard but she was so flat and out of tune. That's where the comedic aspect of the film comes in. There are some parts of the film where it was a bit dull, but luckily those parts were rare and the majority of the movie is entertaining. Meryl Streep of course is spot on with academy award nominated performance as Florence Foster Jenkins, she's funny, admirable, and deep when you may not expect her to be. Hugh Grant was pretty good too, honestly Streep as Florence overshadows Grant as her husband, but his performance suffices. Both the costume and set design is wonderfully done! I recommend this funny endearing well acted film for anyone who loves this type of film or if you're a Meryl Streep fan. I watched it because I adore Streep and it was pretty good, especially the ending. 7/10."
" Florence Foster Jenkins 1868-1944
",0.0,0.902,2017-04-23 00:00:00,8,"I don't think that there is anyone even among this film's biggest fans out there who think this is an accurate portrayal of the life of the eccentric Florence Foster Jenkins, patron of the arts who decided she belonged in them rather than fund them. Still this outrageous character is interpreted broadly and loudly by Meryl Streep and there's a lot of laughs between the pathos.Growing up I remember there was a kid who loved baseball and was determined to be a ballplayer. The fact that he was more unathletic than I never fazed him a bit. Fortunately he was not rich either or he would have bought a team and put himself in the lineup. Reality did overtake him in his teens and he opted for another career.There is also a classic Criminal Intent episode where rich dowager Claire Bloom who was briefly a child actress decides to finance a performance the way Ms. Jenkins does at Carnegie Hall. She killed to help get that career something Ms. Jenkins never did. Unless it was the work of several composers.One thing that was true in the film was that Jenkins did have syphilis acquired from a husband whom she kicked out. We're not sure that Hugh Grant's character ever was actually married to Jenkins. Still also accurate was that he was devoted to her and the lifestyle she provided for him.Finally this biographical film is proof positive that a few bucks in the bank are truly the only difference between the eccentric and the crazy. I assure you I would have permanent residence at Happydale Acres if I took it upon myself to have a singing career. Edward Everett Horton would have a suite ready for me.Broad, bold, and outrageous was Florence Foster Jenkins and that's how Meryl Streep plays her. It's the kind of role you can really let go and have a ball. Hugh Grant whom as he gets older is starting to resemble Cary Grant is perfect as her male companion/husband. Also pay note to Simon Helberg as her pianist accompanist who sort of joins the loony tunes express after a bit of persuasion. Meryl Streep got the latest in Oscar nominations for Best Actress and the film also was nominated for Costume Design. An outrageous movie about an outrageous character."
" I laughed out loud, over and over
",0.4588,0.8844,2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"For me, comedy in film seems generally hard to sustain. I may be amused at the first few repetitions of The Gag, but then it wears out, and I am looking for something else. In this case, The Gag (Jenkins's terrible singing) goes on being funny as Meryl Streep executes it believably, and apparently with Jenkins's complete lack of self-awareness. Hugh Grant as the Kept Man is fun, too, and this role is a bit of a departure for him. One must also mention Simon Helberg (Howard from ""Big Bang Theory""), who hams up the pianist's discomfort in just the right way.Some friend(s) complained to me about the lack of socially redeeming value in a movie about a woman who simply had too much money, and who, in the film, narrowly avoids much real confrontation with criticism she may deserve. The avoidance itself is another Gag, but the reality that Jenkins was one of the most successful recording artists--or non-artists--of her time lends credence to her generally being protected from the ghastly truth.If I'd been the Oscar selector, I'd definitely have given Streep the 2016 award for this one, over the ""La La Land"" actress who did win. (She was good, but nowhere near so spectacular as Meryl)."

Meryl Streep delivers one of her finest performances as the heiress who was delusional about her singing abilities and casts a light on the real and perhaps forgotten Florence Foster Jenkins. The film showcases other great performances from the likes of Hugh Grant. It was also somewhat tragic to see Florence built up by her husband and pianist in a fantasy where she is a great singer only to be brought crashing down by a real review. The film also focuses on an interesting theme of shielding close ones from reality. If they don't tell you the truth then the whole world will eventually in a cruel and laughable way. All in all a well told story that was easy to follow. Definitely recommend it if you want a nice, relaxing movie to watch that is funny but also manages to be sentimental."

Based on the true story, set in New York City in 1944, in the midst of World War II, Florence Foster Jenkins (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Meryl Streep) is an heiress and socialite with a passion for opera and music, to celebrate this love she founded the Verdi Club. Her husband and manager is British Shakespearean actor St. Clair Bayfield (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Hugh Grant), despite being married they live in separate residences, Bayfield shares his house with his secret mistress, Kathleen Weatherley (Rebecca Ferguson). Florence suffers from syphilis, her illness has caused her various health problems for which she is taking medication, she fears she will pass the disease on to Bayfield, so does not engage in sexual intercourse with him, he indulges his sexual urges with Kathleen. Florence has neglecting singing lessons for some time, she decides to resume them, her vocal coach is Carlo Edwards (David Haig), the assistant conductor at the Metropolitan Opera, she also hires pianist Cosmé McMoon (The Big Bang Thoery's Golden Globe nominated Simon Helberg). McMoon is shocked to discover that Florence is a terrible singer, but Bayfield and Edwards pretend she is wonderful, Bayfield warns him not to criticise her. Bayfield arranges a small recital, hand picking people to buy tickets, and loyal members of the Verdi Club attend, but many members of the audience cannot contain their laughter during Florence's performance, but it does receive good reviews. Florence makes a recording of her singing as a Christmas gift to the Verdi Club, she gives a copy to McMoon, she tells him that Bayfield was not always a successful actor, she hid negative reviews from him, Florence also tells of her previous piano player and teaching experience, including playing for the President as a child, this makes McMoon realises Florence is not totally musically, and their friendship strengthens. Florence and McMoon write and perform original songs together, one of which going on radio, Bayfield and Kathleen are shocked and horrified by this, but many listeners enjoy her music, believing it to be comedic, her demand in popularity leads Florence to booking Carnegie Hall for a one night only performance, thousands of tickets go to soldiers. Bayfield fails to talk Florence out of the performance, Kathleen leaves him after his lack of attention, McMoon confides to Bayfield that he fears that the recital will humiliate him, Bayfield explains he has given up everything to support Florence, McMoon is happy to also support her, he is elated to play at Carnegie Hall. The performance is attended by is packed, attendees include Cole Porter (Mark Arnold) and Tallulah Bankhead (Nat Luurtsema), Florence begins to sing and soldiers laugh and jeer, her supporters and loyal friends however encourage her to keep singing. An editor for the New York Post refuses to continue listening and plans to write a negative review, but Bayfield and McMoon go to great lengths to make sure all reviews are positive, however Florence finds a thrown away copy of the reviews, upset she collapses. As Florence is dying in bed, she imagines a successful performance of herself, Bayfield and McMoon receiving a standing ovation, she points out proudly that even though people can say she could not sing, no one can say she did not sing, she dies peacefully. Also starring Nina Arianda as Agnes Stark, Allan Corduner as John Totten, Christian McKay as Earl Wilson, John Sessions as Dr. Hermann, John Kavanagh as Arturo Toscanini, Liza Ross as Mrs EE Paterson and Stanley Townsend as Phineas Stark. Streep gives a marvellous performance as the woman who is completely tone deaf, but enchanted everyone by trying to sing, Grant is equally fantastic as her devoted husband who will do anything to stop her being a laughing stock. It is a heartwarming story that shows even the not-so talented can achieve stardom, whether for the right or wrong reasons, with loyalty and passion, I will be completely honest and say I was mostly fascinated to watch the cringe-worthy singing, it makes you laugh mostly with the leading character murdering her songs, but at the same time you cannot help but by charmed by her personality and effort, a wonderful biographical comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Costume Design, it won the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Hugh Grant was number 73, and Meryl Streep number 58 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Grant was number 8 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and Streep was number 26 on The World's Greatest Actor.

" Narcissa
",0.0,0.9963,2017-03-13 00:00:00,9,"Florence Foster Jenkins (born 1868 –1944), a wealthy American socialite, has gone down in history as ""the world's worst opera singer"". Although she was notoriously lacking in ability, she suffered from the delusion that she was a great singer, and between the 1910s and the 1940s gave numerous recitals in New York City. Most of these were open only to her friends and members of the ""Verdi Club"", a society she had founded to encourage appreciation of grand opera in America; the wider public, and music critics in particular, were rigorously excluded. Her original name was Narcissa Florence Foster, and although she never used the name ""Narcissa"" it seems curiously appropriate to her personality.There was, however, more to Jenkins than a vain, self-deluding narcissist. She was a generous patron of the arts and counted among her friends and admirers such distinguished musicians as Arturo Toscanini, Thomas Beecham, Lily Pons and Enrico Caruso. Moreover, she was not completely lacking in musical talent. In her youth she had been a promising virtuoso pianist until her career was cut short by an injury to her arm, and her attempts to prove herself as a singer were probably an attempt to compensate for this youthful disappointment.The film concentrates upon the last years of Jenkins' life, culminating in her notorious Carnegie Hall recital on October 25, 1944, a month before her death. (This was one concert from which she could not exclude the critics, and it is said that the savage reviews she received contributed to her death). At the centre of the plot are her relationships with the British actor St Clair Bayfield and with her accompanist, Cosmé McMoon. In real life Bayfield was Jenkins' companion and manager, although it is uncertain of he was ever her lover. Here, however, he is portrayed as her second husband, although they were never married in reality. Theirs, however, is a sexless (although not necessarily a loveless) marriage- Jenkins suffers from syphilis which she contracted from her first husband- and Bayfield is having an affair (to which Jenkins turns a blind eye) with an attractive young woman named Kathleen Weatherley. (In the film Bayfield and Kathleen eventually split up; in reality they were married not long after Jenkins' death).McMoon, as played by Simon Helberg, is a shy, physically unattractive young man with ambitions to become a serious classical musician. He is under no illusions about Jenkins' lack of talent as a singer, and realises that his association with her is making him a laughing-stock in the classical world. He is, however, unable to break off that association, partly because a curious friendship has grown up between them, inspired by their shared passion for music, but also because he needs the very generous salary she pays him. It is Jenkins' money which prevents her from realising that she cannot sing a note; a poorer woman attempting the same self-deception would have had this inconvenient truth pointed out to her, forcibly, at a much earlier stage in her career. The wealthy Jenkins, however, is flattered not only by McMoon but also, and even more shamelessly, by her vocal coach Carlo Edwards who, as assistant conductor at the Metropolitan Opera, is presumably a musician of distinction.Meryl Streep is excellent in the title role, and well-deserved her 20th ""Best Actress"" Oscar nomination, but then she normally is excellent. The real surprise is the performance of Hugh Grant. In the past, Grant's acting career has generally been heavily reliant upon his boyish charm, and he continued to rely upon this throughout his thirties and even (less successfully) well into his forties. Here he still displays plenty of charm, but his boyishness is finally gone and for the first time he tackles a genuine older man's role. Bayfield, a middle-aged Shakespearean actor somewhat younger than Jenkins herself, has had to put his own career on hold to manage his wife's affairs; he has, for example, never achieved his ambition to play Hamlet. He has done this not out of belief in her talent- he is under no illusions on that score- but out of a genuine affection for her. He will go to extraordinary lengths to protect her; when the critic of the ""New York Post"" savages her performance in a damning review he buys up every copy of the paper in the area in an attempt to prevent her from reading it.""Florence Foster Jenkins"" has been described as a comedy, but I do not think that is quite accurate. What it is is a tragicomedy. The title character has something in common with the Emperor in Andersen's fable of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", but unlike that hapless monarch she is not simply a figure of fun. She has more in common with some of the characters in Moliere's plays such as Orgon in ""Tartuffe"", characters who are foolish and self-deluded yet whose folly and self-delusion are not simply ludicrous but also pathetic, sometimes even verging on the tragic. (Orgon's folly nearly leads to his financial ruin and imprisonment, and he is only saved by a last-minute plot twist). It is part of Streep's great skill as an actress that she can make us see Florence Foster Jenkins not only as a ludicrous figure but also as a near-tragic one, even when she is at her must ludicrous. 9/10"

Meryl Streep is the best living actress, no doubt about it. In this movie she managed to do her own awful singing, which must take considerable skills. I listened to Foster Jenkins original recording and Meryl captured that incredible singing voice. Apart from Streep's interpretation, Hugh Grant playing her husband is quite good too, stretching a bit his range.The plot focus on Foster Jenkins final years and it gave me the feeling of a story taking place at the beginning of 1900, while it actually takes place during WWII. Foster Jenkins is so stuck in the world of her youth that she makes the radio and Big Bands music seem anachronistic.I expected more of a comedy, but some scenes are quite melancholic as the general feeling, apart form the occasional joke and outburst of energy."

But really?You're invited to laugh at her and with her in equal measure, feel bad for her and sometimes even revile her (or is that just me?). I don't think the movie has a stance on her. And I think it mostly lets her off the hook.

Most of all however I felt extremely sad for Florence's character, who was just so very clueless. I guess it comes from a personal place as I know what it feels to be mocked and not realizing it at the time but yes it did upset me after a point.On the other hand, the performances were superb. There are several interesting characters, all multifaceted and very well constructed, that were a joy to discover. Never was any information ever imposing at all, it was given progressively and at key moments and so it flowed so well, which is not an easy thing to achieve in a movie, especially these days. So yes, the screen writing definitely gets a big applause from me.St Claire Bayfield was probably my favourite character. He is so devoted to Florence and yet he is still a man, so he has other needs. He struggles to find a balance between the two and that struggle shone through Grant's performance – one of his best, I must say, certainly the best I have seen of him to date. He didn't even have to say anything for me to feel for him.Little Simon Helberg Well, he blew me away. I had only known his work on The Big Bang Theory and never thought he was capable of pulling off something like this. His effeminate ways paired with his wavering between curiosity, maintaining composure and even his dignity all served to provide numerous humorous moments. He made me laugh most of anyone and he also made me care. That soft side of him truly moved me and provided a much-needed balance to the character and the entire story.And Meryl Streep. Well. Not much to say about such an amazing actress. Stellar performance from beginning to end. Again, her story was told in the most organic, natural manner. There was never any info dumping and for that I was extremely grateful.Florence Foster Jenkins is an interesting movie with a varied set of characters. It got quite a bit tiring for me at some points, there was some language that definitely did not seem fitting of 1944, and I honestly grew tired of Florence's singing. It was one of those things that I felt were OK do it once or twice as it is funny, but do it much more than that it is just annoying and, again, sad.I definitely recommend you watch it but for sure be prepared to both laugh and become quite emotional."
" Great cast, amusing story, but slightly dull.
",0.0617,0.9945,2017-02-25 00:00:00,7,"A rather unique story based on true characters. The cast is fitting, and produces great portrayals, while the mise-en-scene really encaptures the time period. Although it presents itself as a comedy, Florence Foster Jenkins is more sad drama than anything else. I won't say it is a bad film, but I guess, it just isn't my cup of tea. Streep is an unrecognizable character in this movie. She embodies Jenkins so vividly that I thought it was bad acting at one point. But it is the character she portrays - the character is quite annoying. It makes me think that perhaps the real Jenkins had some sort of delusional disorder of some type. It really made me cringe to watch her sing so boldly in front of an audience. Kudos to Streep. Grant as well did great in his role. I'm not generally a fan of his, but he fit his character well. What surprised me, was Helberg's performance. I couldn't be sure if he was indeed the same actor as the one in The Big Bang Theory, as he looked like him, but his persona was vastly different. An unsuspecting side of Wolowitz, I guess he wanted to have a break from that character. His character as McMoon, is, I would say, as important as both Jenkins and St. Clair is in the film. All three had great connection which helped to sell the characters. The mise-en-scene too, was very well established and helped to create the atmosphere of the 19th century, and early 20th century. The costumes and dress styles are very prominent, and maybe it is the cast themselves, but I was thinking that this was set in Britain. Most likely this was just a thought influenced by Grant being in the film. While it isn't a horrible film, I didn't really like it. The character of Jenkins is quite complicated, and perhaps with more of a backstory, I might have been able to sympathize with her more. Also, I did not realize that this story was biographical at the time that I watched it. I thought it was some random movie that I found on the plane. With more of a backstory to the character of Jenkins, I might have guessed it was based on a true story. Overall, a well made film with a great cast, but not to my liking."
" A shame about the controversy because it's not bad
",-0.0644,0.962,2017-02-25 00:00:00,7,"I feel sorry for a film like 'Florence Foster Jenkins'. It's actually a surprisingly enjoyable little tale, that will never get to know its true potential. The reason for this? Meryl Streep and her big mouth. At the 2017 Golden Globes she decided to deliver a highly controversial speech which was extremely hurtful to a lot of people. Of course the only thing she actually achieved with her speech was to hurt this film. People turned their anger on it (and a few probably showed extra positivity towards it to compensate) and thus the opinions of the film were entirely skewed and forever will be. Streep has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Lead Role. It has to be said, the woman can act. The role gave her a lot of areas to shine in. The terrible singing was done well, the relationship scenes were handled eloquently and the illness side of things were the icing on the cake to secure her the nomination. I would give her almost no chance of winning however, simply due to the strength of the other performances and the film probably not having garnered enough attention.I'll admit 'Florence Foster Jenkins' was not a film I was overly looking forward to watching. There was almost no part of it that appealed to me. So the fact that I actually mildly enjoyed it says a lot about just how well this was made. It's a true story and the morals of what happened aren't exactly clear. You could argue either way that the people allowing this to happen were great for what they did, or that their efforts were misguided and only served to hurt and embarrass. At the end of the day though it's a harmless film that can be a fun watch if you so choose."

" Strong performances within a slight story
",0.5106,0.9984,2017-02-18 00:00:00,7,"FLORENCE FOSTER JENKINS could have been (should have been?) a trifle of a film.  A fluffy, light wisp of a comedy that amiably passes the time on a grey Sunday afternoon where you don't really want to leave the couch.  But under the direction of Stephen Frears (The Queen, Philomena) and with strong performances by Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant, this film becomes something a bit more.Based on the true story of a N.Y. music socialite, the titular Florence Foster Jenkins, a woman with a love of song, but not the voice for it, this film, ostensibly, tells the story of her infamous concert at Carnegie Hall.  But it is more than that.  It really tells the story of Jenkins and the unorthodox relationship that she had with her husband, St. Clair Bayfield, who kept Florence in the world in which she wished to live, shielding her from the harsh realities of real life.The character of Florence Foster Jenkins could have easily been played on one note, for laughs, as a foolish, out of touch, socialite who invites our ridicule.  But played by the always brilliant Meryl Streep - in a performance deserving of her Oscar nomination - Jenkins is much, much more than that.  Streep's performance, like always, is layered with nuanced emotions and understanding and she turns what could have been a caricature into a character.  Is she delusional about her singing ability?  Absolutely.  Does she understand the deceits that her husband is perpetrating?  Absolutely.  Can these two things live together simultaneously on Streep's face? Absolutely!Matching Streep stride for stride in this film is Hugh Grant as St. Clair Bayfield.  Grant was semi-retired from acting when Director Frear approached him for this role and he only said yes to work with Streep and I'm glad he did.  This, by far, is my favorite performance of his.  At first you think Bayfield is just using Jenkins for her money, but by the end of the film you can see he has great love and affection for her and will go to any lengths to protect her.This film also has many, many wonderful supporting roles that help build up Jenkins world - from Simon Helberg as pianist Cosme McMoon (from who's vantage point we, the audience, enter this world) to Nina Arianda as an uncouth music socialite who becomes an unlikely ally of Jenkins to Christian McKay as a critic that refuses to enter into the deception and call it like he sees it, all bring something to the party to make this world richer.And that is necessary, for Director Stephen Frears was very little to work with from a screenplay by Nicholas Martin.  Going in, the audience knows that Jenkins is going to perform (badly) at Carnegie Hall so it is the journey to the performance that matters and Frears is a master at making something out of nothing.  He creates the period, style and mood deftly and inhabits this world with interesting characters and that is almost enough to block out the slight story that is unfolding beneath.Almost...but not quite.  At the end, I enjoyed the world and the performances but was left a little unsatisfied by the story - there just wasn't enough there to be satisfied with.Like Jenkins herself, there is enough to be entertained for a bit, but - ultimately - it will not last in memory for much after it is done.Letter Grade:  B+7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"

How cruel to have to find out the truth at the scathing hands of the Post critic. I can't help but compare this ""based on actual events"" story with recent similarly true releases; Lion, A United Kingdom, Queen of Katwe, all worth spending the dollars and time to bring to the screen and a wider audience. I see this production as just creating a wider audience to laugh at Florence, not matter how you dress it up as her joy of life etc people are YouTubing to laugh at her horrendous recordings.

" passion vs. talent
",0.7003,0.9987,2017-02-03 00:00:00,8,"I cannot help it. Every film she shines in (because this is what stars do – they shine) ends by being about her. The great actress who is and lives on screen as every character she is incarnating, who makes this character an unforgettable person which you may love or hate, worship, despise or pity, but always remember. Of course, I am speaking about Meryl Streep. What a luck for us, movie viewers, to be her contemporaries! Florence Foster Jenkins was a real person, involved in the social and musical life of the first half of the 20th century in New York. She had a real passion for music, and enough money to pay for this passion, including helping and promoting musicians and musical events. Her only little sin was that she had the ambition to sing and her talent did not match her ambition. She had passion though, and was protected by a loving (and apparently platonic) husband who was hiding from her the bitter truth about her skills. The film is about the balance between passion and talent, and is also about the very special forms real love sometimes takes.This combination of biopics and melodrama worked incredibly well for me. This was of course because of the tremendous talent and amazing performance of Meryl Streep, but not only. I also found Simon Helberg to be charming and funny in the role of the pianist who is hired to play with the strident diva. Hugh Grant is aging well and fits wonderfully in the role of the husband, and all the show is directed with British elegance by Stephen Frears. This is a film to watch, one of the better ones of the Academy Awards season. Watch it. You may learn that the ways of Art and the ways of Love are sometimes as mysterious as the ways of God."
" Good movies are still being made folks
",0.4404,0.9839,2017-02-02 00:00:00,8,"This one pleasantly surprised me. Meryl Streep does a nice job as the real-life untalented Ms. Jenkins, who is surrounded by people who just want to make her happy. She hires a pianist (Simon Helberg, one of the geeks from ""The Big Bang Theory"") but no one will tell her how bad she is, least of all her husband, played by Hugh Grant. Inspired by the boys fighting in WW II, she cuts a record, then manages to book a concert at Carnegie Hall for the troops. (One flaw during the concert - the actress who plays Tallulah Bankhead is way too good-looking to be believable as the actual Bankhead.) Streep pulls off the role very well. I found myself laughing at some of the voice rehearsals, but feeling a twinge of sorrow as this woman was trying to pursue a dream seemingly beyond her reach. Helberg is quirky as her pianist, who realizes she stinks, but comes around to supporting her. The big surprise for me was the performance of Hugh Grant. Just watch his eyes and you will see his every emotion, from his affection for Streep (despite his having an affair), his desire to make her happy, and his anguish as he watches her bomb. His performance is the most impressive.Solid performances, good script, laugh-out-loud moments, and tender scenes. Good movies are still being made, folks."
" Forgettably simple
",0.0,0.9964,2017-02-01 00:00:00,5,"There's the old joke that goes something like this: ""Pardon me, how do you get to Carnegie Hall?"" ""Practice, practice, practice!"" It would seem that the origins of this joke (who many attribute to Jack Benny) might also ring true for a woman like 'Madame Florence,' as she is affectionately called throughout the titular film. A run down New York socialite with a flair for camp, Ms. Jenkins' story is presented with heart and restrain.Stephen Frears' film follows in the footsteps of his recent work to examine the life of a woman (remember how marvelous ""The Queen"" was with Helen Mirren, or ""Philomena"" with Judi Dench) in extraordinary circumstances. I suppose with this third film, he has made a sort of trilogy examining the place of elderly women in an ever-changing society.It's 1944 in the midst of war, and we get to know Florence; a quiet type with a retired husband (Hugh Grant, and how marvelous he is). Together they have founded the Verdi Club, which seeks to be in the ranks of high society and serves potato salad like it's going out of style. St Clair Bayfield, her husband, supports her every will and only wants to make her happy. We realize that since Florence contracted syphilis in her youth, they don't share the same bed. In fact, they don't share the same house. St Clair sees a woman on the side, and to those who seem concerned, he explains ""there is so much love to give.""Inspired by a performance while in the audience at Carnegie Hall, Florence decides to start up vocal lessons again. Hiring a meager pianist and taking lessons from no less than the greatest vocal coach in all New York, she sets out to prepare for a live show. Here's the catch: she couldn't sing to save her life. In her inner circle of friends, they praise her charm and powerful pitch. To the outsider (as the pianist soon realizes), it's all a farce.I admired the way the film broke away the mold to reveal the softer side of a marriage that is anything but conventional. The relationship between Florence and St Clair, while at times a bit like mother and son, never feels quite like that of a marriage, but I suppose that's the way it goes. As crazy as the story is (as a true story, no less), the film is still structured in a way that becomes a bit predictable and perhaps a bit too long. Her first vocal performance on screen is one that will surely make audiences laugh, but by the time we hear ""Queen of the Night"" in the final performance, it's funny yes, but perhaps a bit monotonous.Meryl Streep delivers a capable performance as the 'rough around the edges' socialite, but I think Hugh Grant is the man who steals the show. Returning to film out of a semi- retirement (who knew?), he makes a large splash on the screen as a charmer who is both mysterious and good. It's a fun role that is exciting to watch. As for the rest of the cast, it's hard to remember a single name or face. The two leads simply take over the show.I thought the film was apt but perhaps not alongside the great work that both Frears and Streep have delivered in the past. The story is a quirky bit of historical trivia that will perhaps ignite a bit of interest to the life of Mrs Jenkins, who knows. Like the few recordings of the real woman singing that remain, maybe all we will remember is that there once was a bad singer who sold out Carnegie Hall. That's interesting enough for me."

Although very enjoyable, and rather humorous, this is just not the sort of movie the Academy has ever really been too excited about. The acting is fine, the direction good, and personally I thought putting the spotlight on this little-known piece of history was both charming and fun. But it was almost too enjoyable to be taken seriously.Meryl Streep is excellent, but that should not be shocking. She is excellent by definition, and this is now her 20th nomination, breaking her own record for most nominations. So, the question is simple: will she win? Although it is possible, and I have not yet seen the other contenders to compare, my suspicion is no. Voters may be having ""Streep fatigue"", and all signs are pointing to it going to Natalie Portman, Isabelle Huppert or Emma Stone. Streep has no buzz at all."

Her singing ability was so limited, she may have been able to perform a song or two, but she sought out the most complex pieces to perform. Because she was very high in society, she was lauded as a great singer because (I suppose) no one wanted to hurt her feelings--and everybody knows the saying about ""money talks..."".Meryl Streep is, as usual, simply mesmerizing in the lead role. It is simply amazing to me that having actual pipes and being able to sing, Ms. Streep actually had coaching to be able to caterwaul like she did. She was so convincing in this role, it was actually painful for me to watch--not to mention listen--to her butcher an aria. Hugh Grant was also top-notch in his performance, playing her ""husband,"" although the two led separate lives. Simon Helberg (of ""Big Bang Theory"") was impeccable as Ms. Jenkins' accompanist, Cosmos McMoon.Again, this is a character driven movie and it can seem a little slow at times.

" Too difficult to sit through
",-0.3612,-0.9012,2017-01-18 00:00:00,5,"I had an unexpectedly strange emotional reaction to this film. It started off well enough. It's a true story about an unusual woman and her delusions about herself.However, I couldn't handle the scenes where Jenkins is humiliated in public. The whole concept of this delusional woman, unwittingly and with the collusion of those around her, performing badly in public was too upsetting to me. The climax of the movie was so threatening that I couldn't stay to watch it, and I walked out when I saw the theatre in which she was to perform was filled with drunk soldiers.So this movie was an emotional minefield for me. One reason I go to movies is to enjoy the emotional evocation, but this one went down an unusual and unwelcome path, i.e. public humiliation. How often do you see a movie about that? It's actually quite a good movie, and it has taught me something about myself, but how should I rate it when I found it too difficult to sit through?"

It is difficult enough to sing those arias well, but amazingly difficult to purposely sing them poorly. Streep manages to mimic the unfortunate sounds of Mrs. Foster Jenkins, down to the off-kilter semi-tones and shrill production. Go have a listen to Mrs. Foster Jenkins on YouTube and you will see what a job Ms. Streep had of it, and how well she did in achieving an excellent imitation of the unique sound this woman possessed.I might also mention that Hugh Grant is at his handsomest and most endearing in his role.

" The Abuse of Florence Foster Jenkins
",-0.6369,-0.6391,2017-01-09 00:00:00,4,"This is an unusually sick, sad and true-life story about a bunch of ""sick"" opportunistic people who took advantage of a mentally and, perhaps, physically sick woman merely because she was wealthy and demented and had no sense of what a fool she had become. I can find no redeeming quality to the movie. It was not enjoyable, enlightening, or educational; it was just SICK! It you want to watch it once, go ahead. But I, for one, didn't like seeing a person being made a clown of simply because her disease made her engage in clownish behavior. If you want to see a freak show, go to the carnival--not the movies. I have enjoyed Meryl Streep's work for decades and have loved her talent for taking on the roles of people we know and remember well. But, I have never seen her demean a real person as she did in this movie. Here, she portrayed Florence Foster Jenkins in 1944 at the age of 76. Jenkins was a wealthy person who had contracted syphilis from her first husband, Dr. Frank Thornton Jenkins, at about the age of 18. After finding out she had contacted syphilis from him, she reportedly divorced him and never spoke of him again—although she did (privately) in movie. She did, however, retain his surname. Her second husband, St Clair Bayfield (Hugh Grant), takes advantage of her money and lack of self-knowledge about how terrible her singing ability really was. Later her pianist, Cosme McMoon (Simon Helberg), does the same thing. (Good people don't let their loved ones make fools of themselves, but they did.) However, it was not just the people closest to her who lived off of her and laughed at her. There were many famous people of the day that were also enjoying her sick foolishness too. These people included Arturo Toscanini (John Kavanagh), Lily Pons, Cole Porter, Tallulah Bankhead, and even Enrico Caruso (not portrayed in the movie). Many of these same people came to Carnegie Hall to hear her make a fool of herself. According to Wikipedia:""At the age of 76, Jenkins finally yielded to public demand and booked Carnegie Hall for a general-admission performance on October 25, 1944. Tickets for the event sold out weeks in advance; the demand was such that an estimated 2,000 people were turned away at the door.[20] Numerous celebrities attended, including Porter, Marge Champion, Gian Carlo Menotti, Kitty Carlisle and Lily Pons with her husband, Andre Kostelanetz, who composed a song for the recital. McMoon later recalled an ""especially noteworthy"" moment: "" (When she sang) 'If my silhouette does not convince you yet/My figure surely will' (from Adele's aria in Die Fledermaus), she put her hands righteously to her hips and went into a circular dance that was the most ludicrous thing I have ever seen. And created a pandemonium in the place. One famous actress had to be carried out of her box because she became so hysterical."" Since ticket distribution was out of Jenkins's control for the first time, mockers, scoffers, and critics could no longer be kept at bay. The following morning's newspapers were filled with scathing, sarcastic reviews that devastated Jenkins, according to Bayfield. ""(Mrs. Jenkins) has a great voice,"" wrote the New York Sun critic. ""In fact, she can sing everything except notes ... Much of her singing was hopelessly lacking in a semblance of pitch, but the further a note was from its proper elevation the more the audience laughed and applauded."" The New York Post was even less charitable: ""Lady Florence ... indulged last night in one of the weirdest mass jokes New York has ever seen. This, to me, is a callous thing to do. I think the movie is callous too. This is not a comedy, it is pathos. Laughing at this movie would be a bit like laughing while watching The Elephant Man."
" Story of deluded socialite is a well-crafted footnote in music history
",0.0,0.9914,2017-01-07 00:00:00,6,"Florence Foster Jenkins is one of those films which is hard to classify as comedy or tragedy. Florence Foster Jenkins was a New York City socialite who inherited quite a bit of money from her father, a very well-off attorney whose family owned land in Pennsylvania. Early on she exhibited talent as a pianist but her musical career was cut short after she contracted syphilis from her husband with whom she eloped with at a young age, but soon separated from.In 1944, the year in which the movie is set (and in which she died), Jenkins had been a fixture on the New York social scene for many years. She was an active participant in numerous women's clubs and as the film makes clear, she established the Verdi Club which promoted classically trained singers (particularly opera). Jenkins had a penchant for dressing up in ostentatious costumes and often had photographic tableaux created as part of her devotion to artistic expression. However, her main interest was operatic singing and she took lessons with numerous prominent operatic teachers until she started singing before private audiences, mostly consisting of various friends and acquaintances in high circles.In the film, Jenkins hires a pianist Cosme McMoon (Simon Helberg, of TV's Big Bang Theory) to accompany her for rehearsals and private performances. In actuality, Jenkins had met McMoon much earlier and he wasn't the only accompanist who played for her. McMoon also was a songwriter and Jenkins later recorded a couple of his songs.The film mainly focuses on Jenkins' companion St. Clair Bayfield (Hugh Grant), an English actor she took under her wings who acted as her manager. Jenkins rented a small apartment for Bayfield in New York City where he carried on a discreet affair with a mistress Kathleen Weatherley (Rebecca Ferguson).Both Bayfield and McMoon are protective of Jenkins, who is in reality a terrible singer with no sense of pitch. The story reaches its apotheosis after Jenkins records a few songs at a recording studio, develops a bit of a cult following and then decides to hold a concert at Carnegie Hall, buying up most of the tickets for a gaggle of soldiers on leave. Most of the audience can't help but laugh at the deluded Jenkins but also end up applauding her for at least trying.Bayfield goes to great lengths to buy up all the copies of the NY Post across the street from Jenkins' apartment as Earl Wilson, the Post's music critic, pans her as a fraud. Eventually, Jenkins gets hold of the review and collapses after reading it—soon afterward, she dies not before imagining herself as an angel in heaven singing like the great operatic singers of the day.The comedy of course revolves around Jenkins' atrocious vocals coupled with her handlers' ultimate unsuccessful attempts to keep her in the dark as to the true nature of her vocal abilities. If there's any tragedy here, it's the saga of a life based on a lack of self-knowledge, reinforced by enablers dependent on a deluded seeker's financial support.Meryl Streep is wonderful as Jenkins, reproducing her atrocious off-key shenanigans to a T. Hugh Grant adroitly conveys his devotion to his patron despite his tragic dependency, and Helberg displays impeccable comic timing as the hapless accompanist.The well-respected director Stephen Frears once again has proffered up another biographical tome which is typical of the vast body of his work. I'm not sure if the subject matter is better treated as a documentary (see the informative ""Florence Foster Jenkins: A World Of Her Own"" on Youtube) than a full feature as is done here. Ultimately Florence Foster Jenkins the movie is a footnote in the history of music, but a well-crafted one at that."
" Ignorance (and money) is bliss
",0.296,0.9982,2017-01-07 00:00:00,7,"I'm gonna be honest, 'Florence Foster Jenkins' is not an unforgettable movie, but more kind of a tender and funny experience made unforgettable by Meryl's once again striking performance. She's the best in town, it's almost lame how perfect and convincing and unique she can be in every single project, and Hugh Grant and Simon Helberg are simply exquisite with their 'little' white lies. Because, yes, this is was this movie is about. Florence is a passionate rich woman who really can't sing, but she simply loves music so much she was even capable of fighting syphilis for over 50 years, with a caring - yet selfish and lying - husband always by her side. And that's probably one of the most controversial aspects of the picture. Florence and St Clair shared a totally platonic relationship for 35 years, and as the movie goes on we're faced with the fact that her husband is cheating on her, lying to her and probably even using her assets and power in the industry to fulfill his never-accomplished acting career. Nevertheless, the infinite tenderness between them felt totally real and genuine and, probably mostly because of the endless flaws of their marriage, extremely real. Florence is a lovely woman, and that's probably why Cosmè McMoon, her young pianist, with his amused (and amusing) grimaces and giggles kind of embodies the viewer himself: we are Cosmè. We do realize how bad Florence's singing skills are; we are confused, we totally don't get how people could barely contain their laughs in the theater every time she sang, but as long as we see the effort she puts in everything she desperately tries to learn, we can't resist and we fall in love with her. We become her dearest friend, her left hand when she can't play the piano with both (there's a beautiful scene in Cosmè's loft when they play piano together, and she can't use her left hand because of her illness and they start playing along in one of the most beautiful shots of the movie).Huge shout out to the entire art department: costumes, make-up and set design are the buttonhole of the picture. Direction and cinematography are classic and clean, colors are simply delightful and embrace the dreamy mood of the picture. 'Florence Foster Jenkins' is, again, not an unforgettable movie, but surely a nice story acted and displayed brilliantly."
" Funny, entertaining, and sincere
",0.8176,0.9908,2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"Florence Foster Jenkins singing voice was flat and off-key, yet her generosity to others, friendship with music greats such as Arturo Toscanini, and love of music brought happiness to many during the dark days of World War II. Labeled by some intemperate critics as ""the worst singer in the world,"" Jenkins is given something of a tribute in Stephen Frears' (""Philomena"") film bearing her name. Produced by Tracey Seaward (""War Horse"") and Michael Kuhn (""Being John Malkovich"") and written by Jonathan Martin, the film stars Meryl Streep (""Suffragette"") as the singer whose vocal talent reached everything except the notes. Not surprisingly, Streep is marvelous as the charming socialite as is her husband St Clair Bayfield played by Hugh Grant (""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."") in what may be a career-redeeming performance.Though Jenkins was not a world-class opera singer by any stretch of the imagination, she had a devoted following who flocked to her concerts and helped her records become collector's items. Having contracted syphilis from her first husband at the age of 18, Jenkins spent a lifetime battling the disease and lived to the age of 76, kept alive by her devotion to opera and the love of her second husband. Bayfield arranged her performances, bribed critics to give her good reviews, and made sure her performances were only attended by her fans. Though the film makes clear his love for Florence, it also shows him living with his mistress Kathleen (Rebecca Ferguson, ""Mission Impossible – Rogue Nation"") in a separate apartment.We first see Florence in a series of performances at the Verdi Club which she founded where her outlandish costumes and over-the-top theatrical performances provide much entertainment to her followers. With Bayfield's help, she takes singing lessons from Carlo Edwards (David Haig) and enlists a young pianist Cosmé McMoon (Simon Helberg, ""The Big Bang Theory,"" TV show) to provide her accompaniment. Helberg is terrific as the flabbergasted pianist whose expression when he first hears Jenkins sing is priceless. Despite his reservations about what his attachment to Jenkins will do to his career, he sticks with her despite his reservations and continually grows fonder of her.Jenkins' dream was to sing at Carnegie Hall and she accomplishes this late in her life, performing to a group of soldiers given free tickets as a tribute to their service. The film in lesser hands could have become a mockery but Frears balanced presentation, though still an odd mixture of comedy and tragedy, is always respectful, showing the singer's desire to spread joy in spite of her limitations. Though the film leaves open the question of whether or not Jenkins was aware of her lack of ability or was simply delusional perhaps due to her illness, it is mostly irrelevant. Florence Foster Jenkins is funny, entertaining, and sincere, providing moments of tenderness and an atmosphere of purity and innocence that leaves cynicism at the front door."
" Streep is too good at being bad, and the story is great, but that's it, that's it
",0.3071,0.9909,2017-01-01 00:00:00,6,"Florence Foster Jenkins (2016)There certainly are reasons to see this movie, but they won't make this a great movie. It's a good movie, though, and good fun. Based on a very true story, the rise of this very bad singer into popular consciousness is worth telling.As always, Streep is virtuosic. Maybe that's a problem in a way, because they depend so much on her being convincing and compelling that they use too much of her. Impossible? Not at all—the plot is simple enouch as it is, and it stalls with long sections of Streep singing really badly really well. It's not easy to be bad on purpose. But it you itch for more sometimes.Hugh Grant? An interesting and not quite canny casting move (is this a problem with having more than one casting director?). He's stretching himself slightly out of the typecasting he's been stuck in (successfully) for years. And it actually clicks pretty well, and yet isn't quite a fit for Streep. Or for the time period (WWII New York, more or less). You can read the remarkable details of this woman's life elsewhere—and in the final credits—and it's what holds it all together, of course. But this is a movie, and it doesn't fill in and make vivid the experience (the movie experience) fully. You'll see. Enjoyable but ultimately thin."
