" An uplifting film about a strong, independent clown suit that won't let anything get in its way!
",0.5562,0.8074,2021-02-22 00:00:00,6,An interesting film about a man slowly turning into John C. Reilly.Why when the man was in A&E for his clown nose did he not think to ask the doctor to try and remove his outfit? He would've become a medical marvel.There was an awful lot of children approaching adults. Like the small boy rapping at the door with a bag of lucky charms.I enjoyed it.
" Possible solution to deal with this demon clown suit
",0.3182,0.504,2021-02-21 00:00:00,7,Couldn't you ask NASA next time they journey up to space to take the demon clown suit with them and just let it go into space? I mean then it would be gone. Can demons survive in space? Surely not.

" Bloody hell, this was creepy - and totally unpredictable!!
",-0.8436,0.9905,2020-12-24 00:00:00,7,"Holy crap!!! Of all the movies that surprised me this year, 'Clown' has to be at the top of the list! This is NOT what I was expecting. 'Clown' is one of the biggest surprise movies I've seen in a long time.And when I say ""surprise"", this is defined as shockingly the opposite of what I expected. Where do I even start? Ok, lets start with the most obvious: Andy Powers. Wow, he is fantastic in the role of Kent, the father who becomes the clown. The premise is simple: Kent and his wife Meg plans a clown-themed party for their seven-year old son, who loves clowns. When the event coordinator informs them the clown was double booked, Kent finds a clown outfit and delights his son as a clown.However, the following day things start going very wrong. I don't want to ruin it with spoilers, as this is a film you have to see for yourself to fully appreciate the surprise factor. My gosh, this film is just relentless!! The film features incredible effects and make-up, and is creepy as hell! I mean, this is seriously one of the creepiest films I've seen in a very long time.What I enjoyed about Kent, is the fact that he didn't hide anything from his family. He told his wife exactly what was happening and what he was going through. That made it more realistic, and I rooted for this character all the way. Andy Powers is just so incredibly good. Thanks to his brilliant acting and the use of facial expressions, I felt every bit of agony he experienced. I firmly believe the film would not have worked so well without him in the lead. I also have to commend director Jon Watts for a job well done. There was no room for sentimentality or mercy 'because the victims are kids'. He went all out to bring us one of the most memorable horror films in recent years.The film is fast-paced and very, very disturbing due to it being so relentless. Children should NEVER watch this!! 'Clown' is completely unpredictable and a truly unique possession tale. I LOVED it!!!Would I watch it again? Oh, absolutely!"
" A definite shocker
",0.128,0.8914,2020-12-18 00:00:00,9,"I think most people upon stumbling across Clown would consider it one of those cheesy low-budget killer clown flicks. They all have the same plot, bland one dimension characters and so on and so fourth. While this film has the general idea of a child eating clown, it definitely differs from others. The actual plot itself- a man named Kent who dresses as a clown for his sons birthday only to find that he can't rid of the costume nevertheless remove it off himself, etc, etc. That within itself gives me anxiety for the character! But, it's a different story, different characters.Speaking of, the acting was pretty good as well. You could easily get sucked into it and I felt myself feeling a bit bad for the man and his family. The characters aren't posed as over annoying nor do they make the hand-to-face choices the characters typically do to drag the plot along. The only thing was that during the middle it got a little stiff. Somewhere in between I kept looking down at my phone and getting a tiny bit distracted. I personally didn't find it scary, through the clown definitely was creepy looking with his origins and features and such. So, if your looking for more of a scary, cover your face sort of movie this isn't it. But still a good movie nonetheless!"

The second half is more formulaic ie monster after children, but overall it's a lot better than most of this type."

",-0.2263,-0.933,2020-11-20 00:00:00,1,"The main character turns into a clown and kills people. Sad to see such a deep and complex plot wasted but it's true it's sadly not that good. I know we would all expect a movie with such a brilliant and revolutionary plot to be a groundbreaking movie but unfortunately it does not deliver. All joking aside this is honestly a darn horrible movie possibly the worst I've ever seen, this movie is a disease, you would have more fun having massive diarrhoea then viewing this disgrace of a film. #AvoidAtAllCosts"

A couple of scenes grabbed my attention like the kids play area, definitely liked the angles shot and the colors. The acting in this movie was below average and the plot was even worse. It lacked emotion and the characters seemed so detached. The dillema of giving the clown children to eat was not very interesting. Its more disturbing than it is horror and the gore wasn't impressive."

I figured when I saw that Laura Allen starred and that Eli Roth was a producer that this movie would be good and I was right.

They could have even done away with the demon sub-plot and let the movie take on a more abstract terror.Like the poignant vibes of the superb 'A Ghost Story' (2017) which had genuine resonance and a feel for the material.Instead, like old wallpaper, it hangs, it cracks and then it falls. Following suit and stumbling into the blind, schlocky arena you had hoped it would avoid. Dark, noisy monster and slurpy sound effects. I believe if they had thought it through, they could have had something quite original on their hands, 'a sad and ultimately moving horror movie' Instead, they played it safe and straight into the hands of the norm. Shame, they had half a good movie."

",0.0,0.9938,2020-04-10 00:00:00,4,"The directorial feature debut from writer/director Jon Watts (Spider-Man: Homecoming, Cop Car) is a pretty by the numbers horror movie but with some nice twists along the way. Kent (Andy Powers) is a dedicated father who, upon hearing that the kids entertainment can't make it to his sons birthday party, stumbles upon a clown costume and decides to dress up and be the entertainment himself! All is fun and games until the day after when he discovers he can't take it off. The more he tries the more welded it seems to his skin and searing into his flesh. He looks for the source of this outfit and what dark secrets lie underneath it. It's a pretty cool premise but unfortunately it's played with such a straight face that it's hard to have a huge amount of fun with it. It has wonderfully gory moments (one including a nose right near the start which is really tense!) and is performed well with a particularly crazy role from Peter Stormare! The mythology behind the Clown is explored really nicely and the creepy origins could've done with a little more screen time. Overall, worth a watch for any clown horror fans but you're not missing too much"
" Disappointing.
",-0.4939,0.5848,2020-04-09 00:00:00,1,The only thing that saved this movie was the creepy vibe from the clown. I saw the trailer and hoped it would be decent. Forget that!
" Who knew turning into a clown was so stressful
",-0.6418,0.6267,2020-04-05 00:00:00,6,Ever wanted to see what would happen if you where to slowly turn into a killer clown? Watch this movie. It's somewhat of a pennywise prequel. Fans of clown movies will very much enjoy this one. If your not a fan of horror movies or clown movies there's not much for you here. I'll give the film credit for trying an original topic idea.

",0.4404,-0.8162,2019-08-12 00:00:00,6,"I saw this for £4 in a supermarket and decided to pass. When I saw it was available on Netflix UK, I thought 'What the Hell?'.
I had very low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. For a horror film, the acting isn't too bad and the script is darkly comic. If killer clowns are your thing, it's no IT, but the idea of an otherwise innocent person slowly being corrupted by a curse is reminiscent of An American Werewolf In London and adds a bit of tension to a concept that could have resulted in a substandard, run-of-the-mill slasher flick.
In years to come I think Clown will be regarded as a cult classic."
" Surprisingly good
",0.6249,0.9445,2019-08-12 00:00:00,8,"My wife and I enjoy watching horror movies primarily to laugh at them and make fun of the bad executions of terrible ideas. We went into this expecting the same, a never heard of low budget horror movie to scoff at. We ended up invested in this movie and enjoying the hell out of it! We will definitely watch it again. Clown knows it's cheesy and rolls with it. The gore is top notch and there is enough of a slow burn into the transformation that you can really enjoy the character shift. It's a dumb premise that KNOWS it's dumb and owns it wonderfully. One of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time. More than just something to make fun of. It isn't scary at all, but it is very entertaining! I would love this movie to be on an episode of How Did This Get Made?."
" Bang average.
",0.0,0.9727,2019-07-18 00:00:00,6,"Listen, it's not the worst horror movie that's ever been made, but neither is it all that great. To be honest, it's just like 90% of the horror movies out there - it's a bit meh.The lead actor does a decent job, the others not so much. It's not a very scary film by any means, it's Eli Roth so of course it's gory, but scary? No. There is little to no tension throughout, and you don't actually see much of the killing (just children's body parts).The idea was good, and the effects were also well done. Nevertheless, that doesn't save this from being just another average film within what seems to be an ocean of bang average horror films.5/10"
" Very watchable , but could have been better.
",0.5927,-0.8515,2019-06-25 00:00:00,6,"This movie has a good premise its dark and moody, and creepy , the picture seems rushed in the final third and does dissapoint to a high degree , when the final transformation happens the demon isnt on screen long enough, and in my opinion the demon clown is one of the most horrible things ive seen in a horror movie, by far scarier than pennywise in the original IT and ITS remake, its worth a look on just for that alone, Could have been a gem this! but ultimately it lets itself down. The clown maybe scarrier than pennywise but IT (1990) still rules in the clown horror genre."

The story towards the end just seemed lazy. They were setting it up as if there was some sort of cure/fix. The ending was a massive let down that after all that he was just killed and his suit was seized in evidence. The music would imply this fact was ominous but was just poor. It felt like it was just cut short.
In short, it's worth a watch if you like horror. But don't expect anything near IT"

 Unfortunately, there are not many that hit the mark, until 'Clown' was reluctantly released. 
This was one of the films that fall under the Circus tent of ""I heard about this but when does it come out?"" 
I wondered for years, it seemed, if this would be a straight to DVD or Theatrical Release!?
When said film was finally released here in the states, I was NOT Disappointed! From start to finish it is a gory, bloody, bizarre, roller coaster of Fear and Discomfort! 
When its backed by Eli Roth, You almost can be certain it will be a bloody good time! 
The story is an original take on a Horror film (Not another Re-Boot) Transformation-Were' Clown Monster, Demons and Child Endangerment! 
This film is Intense and just all out cool! 
For all you Monster Kids and Gore-Hounds! Highly Recommended!"
" A very underrated grim and intriguing take on Clowns.
",-0.6096,-0.9815,2018-07-03 00:00:00,8,"At this point everyone is well-versed and familiar with the fears of clowns, and the overall creepy aesthetic that they carry, but the concept shown in this overlooked horror gem is probably the most sinister and frightening. The fascinating spin they put on clown mythology was so depraved and evil and went in very disturbing territory, but that's what horror to me is about. Alongside just being an overall twisted horrifying film with an interesting story, I found the cinematography to be very well done and the tone and atmosphere was set perfectly through it. If you're into horror in general you should check this out and especially if you're into clowns because it delivers very well on both fronts and really doesn't hold back. You will not look at clowns the same way after seeing this film."

" The most unique take on a clown themed horror film, Clown brings us the story of a man who uses a cursed clown suit to his son's birthday party
",-0.25,0.9905,2018-05-27 00:00:00,6,"Clown is directed by Jon Watts and produced by Mac Cappuccino, Cody Ryder and Eli Roth. It brings us the story of Kent McCoy (played by Andy Powers) who is hosting a birthday party for his son. He hires a clown but unfortunately the clown ends up accidentally going to a different party. Luckily Kent finds an old clown suit in the basement and puts it on and goes to the party himself. After the party, Kent falls asleep in the suit and the next day finds that he can not take it off and notices that the body suit, wig and nose all begin to fuse with his body. Having no other choice he leaves for work wearing the costume.After a few attempts at taking the costume off Kent goes to his wife (played by Laura Allen) and she tries to remove his fake nose. While doing that they notice that the skin on the nose is starting to peel off too. With no other choice he goes to the hospital. There he starts to show some sings of strange behavior and starts developing a strong sense of hunger. After researching a bit he finds out that (mild spoiler) it is not actually a costume but it's the skin of a demon and the only way to satiate his hunger is to devour kids. (end of mild spoiler)I'm not the biggest fan of killer clowns but the direction that this film took was very pleasant and intriguing. The acting was decent and camerawork was ok but could be better. At the start it felt a bit cliche and cheesy but it started to pick up as the plot progressed. The gore was awesome as well which was surprising for me since I rarely point out gore in films. The pacing was very well too.However I do think that this movie could have been done much better. I enjoyed it yes but not as much as I wanted to since I really loved the premise of it. It was a fresh take on killer clowns and I really wish it was better since it was obvious that a lot of effort was made on it. But even with it's faults it is definitely a movie that you should watch."
" Entertaining and pretty original

The best thing about this movie is that it doesnt take itself too seriously. Watch out of the attempted suicide scene - its absolutely priceless."
" Awful in every way
",-0.4588,-0.5325,2018-05-12 00:00:00,2,"I have a weakness for Roth-related material. He's an easy target for most, who usually haven't seen much of his work if any, so for the many times he surprised me the right way, I tend to be attentive and overlook the flaws.Overlook this whole movie. It doesn't even try to have an ""oldie 80's look"", it just takes every trick in the book. Jump scares are lame, the orchestra hits will often get you to understand you were supposed to be scared a second ago. The score is AWFUL. Barely daytime TV movie level.The acting is terrible. Sure they're not helped by the scooped in dialogue, which managed to steal a few smiles from me as I wondered which awful truism would come out of the next open mouth. And as most of the action is as predictable as your average informercial, oh they do walk the walk and talk the talk.The clown, is, well, a clown. No real effort is made, for example when he tries to take off his wig and fake nose, the scene is one of the most ridiculous that comes to mind. Worse, it feels like the guy thinks he's smart and clever grimacing his way through it. Yet any slap scene from any soap drama the world over has more convincing violence than that.As I'm a jerk, I'll go on with the wife, a breeze of vapor, I wonder how many takes were necessary for her ""My husband would never do anything like that"" delivery, wich had me rewinding and replay several times over to be believed, and all the scenes poor Stormare desperately tries to get a pulse from her, and desperately tries to get done with his stupid, convoluted explainatory text. I hope Stormare got away with most of the budget with his Christopher Lloyd impression, he deserved it.And the kid. Oh the kid. I could bet that the scene of his first main appearance, where he's just sitting at the kitchen table, took serveral takes as he kept sending stares at the camera. I don't know if it was the case but it really felt that way. Most of his lines are dubbed as his facing away or backlit.The action, the gore? Nothing but bloody prothesis of little kids limbs! Yeah! How's that for fun? It fills the running time, with stupid kids running around the clown until quick snacking scenes are suggested.Any attempt of cleverness in direction is ill thought and awfully done. The very few decent scenes towards the end, you have seen the exact same ones in older, better movies.A waste of time. For children maiming afficionados only. And people who feel wise at guessing stuff."
" Clowns Are Truly Creepy!
",0.4926,-0.6059,2018-04-07 00:00:00,5,"This 2014 horror film stars Andy Powers, Laura Allen and Peter Stormare.
This tells about mild-mannered guy, Kent (Powers) who is a real-estate agent. After a clown cancels for his son's birthday party, he decides to fill in. He finds an old, clown costume and learns it's cursed by an evil presence which causes him to change into something monstrous. Allen plays Kent's wife, Meg and Stormare (Fargo) plays Karlsson, a man who tries to help Kent break the curse. Clowns are truly creepy and this film proves it
much like ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space"" and ""It."" It's not bad and features a decent cast & good make-up effects. Check this out at least 
once horror fans."
" Prolife or prochoice?
",0.0,-0.8646,2018-03-06 00:00:00,5,"I recently watched Clown and it left my torn. I'm really pro-life and I'm not sure about my position regarding this movie. I understand that the clown demon will not leave his host-body (Kent, played by Andy Powers, usually referred to as 'daddy' or affectionately babe, by the actress whats-her-face), until he has eaten poor, young souls. This brings my to my main concern. While watching I counted the clown demon killing five(!!!!) kids in total:1. Lard Ass 
2. The Kid Who does not Take no for an Answer while Offering Food
3. The Bully
4. Random Ball Pit Kid
5. Fetus(!!!!!!!!!!)This seems to convey the point, that the fetus is not a human being. This I find very disturbing. Even though the fetus has not yet devoloped fully, it is still a human being just like you and I, and should be considered as such in the movie. The question I am left with is this: is this a mistake on the writers behalf (Christopher Ford & Jon Watts) and if so, who is the writer responsible for this omission? Or could it be that this movie is, God forbid, actually is taking a pro-choice stance?! if so, I would be highly disturbed and would have no choice but to withdraw my five star rating and replace it with a one star rating."
" STOP Clowning around!
",-0.4981,0.7407,2018-02-14 00:00:00,1,"Hello, Eli? Mr. Roth? Why did you make this movie? It wasn't scary or even remotely unnerving. In the trues sense of the word, it was a flop--like the noise a clown's oversized shoe would make on asphalt. This clown should have perished in a circus fire like the one they had in Hartford, CT over 35 years ago. The premise of the movie: 100% predictable. Direction: Misguided. Lighting: There wasn't any. Sound: Loud then low, low then loud. Acting: Like a crappy comic book. If you enjoy wasting your time or if you are just curious and want to see if this film could be fodder for Mystery Science Theater 3000, then watch it. If you are expecting an Ed Wood masterpeice, you will be let down. If you couldn't tell, ""I HATED THIS MOVIE!"""
" Movies like this don't scare me...but this movie
",0.6283,0.6565,2018-01-11 00:00:00,9,"Well, scare isn't the right word. But tension? You bet. Don't understand the low ratings. Perhaps not enough gore or the troll/demon under the bridge isn't that familiar. See it for yourself. A great flick."

" Wow I was impressed of how boring it was
",0.6808,-0.9906,2017-11-10 00:00:00,3,"This killer clown thing needs to die off, the only good killer clown movie is IT (both Mini Series and Movie). The director Jon Watts was the director of Spider-Man Homecoming, he did good in that movie and what the hell happen? I don't blame the director, probably studio getting involve. Non of the acting convince me and the writing is dull, also slow pace. I don't mind some slow burn movies but the pacing in this film are terrible. This movie is cliché as hell but it's A KILLER DEMON CLOWN!! WHAT'S NEXT?! A WEREWOLF DEMON KILLER CLOWN FROM OUT OF SPACE?! CAN'T WAIT!! Well, don't watch this movie"
" This is a bad idea
",-0.5423,-0.9675,2017-10-17 00:00:00,7,"Kent (Andy Powers) is a real estate agent running late for his kid's birthday party, one where the clown canceled out. At a client's home he discovers a clown suit in a chest. He puts the suit on and sure enough he selected ""the cursed"" clown suit, one that requires the sacrifice of little children. I hate it when that happens.The film had a few good horror scenes, but was mostly drama filler, poor Kent lamenting in his suit.The film had good scene changes, i.e/ Eli Roth did a professional job with the mechanics of shooting, scene lead ins, etc. but needed to up the horror aspects.Great final kill scene.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
" Easily could've been a little gem - sadly it's not
",-0.0314,-0.8907,2017-09-30 00:00:00,4,"The story of this move has been described many times before, so I'll just skip that part.The good: The premise, the main actor, effects, visuals, audio - nothing to get excited about but it gets the job done.The bad: Almost everything else. What could've been a little twisted turn on body horror movies lacks so many key components. The writing is, at best, mediocre, full of stereotypical sentences one might be sick of be now. The pacing is out of place, what starts slowly and builds up some tension, as the transformation goes on and on, flushes everything down the toilet after the first half and goes frenzy in the last 25 or so minutes. A pretty predictable plot and almost every cliché is also on board, myself got pretty annoyed by all the irrational choices the cast does. And no, they weren't done in state of emergency nor panic. Speaking of annoying - the cast. Especially the mother and her son.. a prime example of dull, lifeless and shallow acting. You also get your fair share of ""I know that would happen now""- jump scares, which adds nothing to the movie.I give it a 5/10 (a 4 would also be totally legit). It's not a total disaster but overall just another at best average movie in a sea full of average horror flicks."
" Very dark and Sinister
",-0.6326,-0.1815,2017-09-05 00:00:00,9,"This movie is a must see for any horror fan. there was never a dull moment from the beginning you knew something bad was going to happen. It gives you a Wayne Gacy-Slender man feel. If you are a true horror fan I recommend watching. **Spoiler Alert** This movie is not for weak stomachs or the weak at heart, You will see a lot of blood and if you cant stomach the thought of a child being killed in a gruesome way (not that anyone should, but it can be unsettling at times to watch) this movie is not for you."
" Another scary clown movie with a slightly different story
",-0.4939,0.9235,2017-06-06 00:00:00,6,"What I will never understand is why some people are afraid of clowns, or mimes etc... I don't think they are scary at all so it remains a mystery why so much people are freaked out by them. My wife is one of them. Just the image of a normal clown freaks her out, so with this movie she's being scared from the first minute till the last. This clown is definitely evil looking so for that I would understand why you would be scared. The story itself is something slightly different than the clown movies we are used to. It's easy to follow, with a bit of gore every now and then. To me the gory parts could have been more detailed to make it better but I guess the lack of budget has something to do with that. The cast is okay for a movie like this one. You never watch a movie in this genre to see great acting, it's just about the horror and the thrills. So you could say it's not a bad movie for this genre. Better than some others that I saw, for sure."
" a comedy that turns to gore
",0.3612,-0.5278,2017-05-30 00:00:00,6,"The movie started out well, more of a comedy that rather quickly became somewhat of a gore fest. The film did seem to meander and had a lot of filler. But overall compared to most of the horror movies today this rated a bit above average. They did a pretty good job of making the clown truly evil and scary looking."
" Very disappointing
",-0.5413,-0.9489,2017-05-28 00:00:00,1,"Last weekend my sister and I were talking about killer clowns and how scared she was of them, and while she was surfing through Netflix she found this movie and I dared her to watch and making her as well as myself watch it was probably one of the worst possible decisions that I have ever made. The movie does start off good however starting the Stirling at a little boys' birthday party and his mother (Laura Allen) is on the phone with her husband Kent (Andy Powers) and asks him to wear a clown suit in order to surprise their son for his birthday, but nobody knows right away that it's a cursed outfit which is the biggest plot twist of the story and Kent can't get it off after trying anything and everything he possibly could do get it off of him. After that this is where things get really boring even though I was expecting to bite my nails and scream like a little girl even though I did none of that throughout the course of the movie. Then the suit controls Kent's body and mind turning him into a cannibal clown, and in turn his a man to help her return her husband back to normal named Karlsson (Peter Stormare). Then everything gets totally predictable, and everything goes right out the window, and after watching this I was totally disappointed with Eli Roth because I thought that would be good by the look of it and now that it is a week after watching it I question why people call him the ""Master of Horror"" after producing a total piece of cinematic trash like this, I mean after the beginning of the movie the whole plot goes downhill and takes the movie right down with it, the screenplay makes the movie predictable and boring to the point where we don't even care about what kind of trouble that the characters happen to be in, and the performances are just plain terrible. But don't get me wrong I love a good horror movie which are movies like ""Psycho"" (1960) and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) which brought on real scares unlike this movie which was a total gore-fest, this isn't the worst movie that I've ever seen but it sure is one of them."
" One of the Best Horror Films I've Seen in Recent Years
",0.128,-0.9885,2017-04-05 00:00:00,9,"Am I the only one who appreciates this film as a dark comedy? The premise is straight out of a cheesy campfire story. A haunted clown suit which possesses people with an 'ancient evil'. I mean come on, how can you not see this as a silly satire of horror movies in general?There's loads of darkly comic transitions and juxtapositions, such as the wife telling Jack that 'daddy will be home tonight' followed by transition to him shooting himself in the head. Then the whole suicide scene following that in which you don't want the wife to come in and disturb his decapitation.Having watched a lot of David Lynch recently I have started to rethink what 'bad acting' really is. I honestly think that the awkward set up and exposure of the child actors to their inevitable demise is purposeful. People don't seem to be getting that this is really a black comedy and this technique of ridiculous set up to murder is part of what makes it funny. take that irritating kid playing online games for example, we don't see him being killed but we see his heart being thrown at the TV screen, it's silly. The problem is that people lower their expectations for horror films unless it's so obviously 'arty'. This film has a brutal sense of humor and it isn't cheap in it's jump scare approach unlike the majority of modern schlocky horrors out there."
" You have to love Eli Roth....
",0.6369,0.9479,2017-01-18 00:00:00,8,"I don't remember where I saw the preview for this movie at but I had just binge watched a bunch of Eli Roth movies such as Green Inferno and Aftershock and I knew I had to add this one to my list. I was surprisingly impressed and normally Clown movies don't do much for me and I'm terrified of Clowns! The premise was unique and his transformation kept my attention. There were a couple of things that were kind of weird and made me cringe but isn't that every Eli Roth movie?! I was really impressed with this movie and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves a good Eli movie! Also, watch out for his cameo appearance because if you don't look closely enough, you just might miss it!!"
" A ""must see"", for horror film buffs.
",-0.5719,-0.9407,2017-01-13 00:00:00,8,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I started watching this flick. The premise sounded a bit corny, so I wasn't getting my hopes up.By the time the ending credits started rolling, I knew that I had found a real gem, as I queued up for a second viewing.This movie has all the makings of a classic horror film, and I would be disappointed if no sequels of it are produced. The actors did a fine job of portraying some surprisingly well written characters while the storyline moved along at a good, steady pace.Although this film has its fair share of Gore, it doesn't turn into a mindless slaughterfest that so many similar movies resort to. Granted, it's not as deep as ""It"", or ""The Last Circus"", but it does touch on more than one moral dilemma, as well as a couple of interpersonal conflicts between characters.Enough about the ""drama"" aspect. Although I am avoiding the risk of being labeled a spoiler, I have to say that this movie has the most frightening clown that I have ever witnessed, and, that it contains a couple scenes that might disturb some of the most ardent horror fans. I am looking forward to the release of a sequel."
" Let's be honest...
",0.0,-0.9644,2017-01-04 00:00:00,3,"... (some spoilers) This film was pretty awful from a story point of view. If you watched the trailer and have ever seen a horror movie, you'll have no trouble figuring out the loosely veiled ending. The cinematography is the only reason I rated this as a 3 rather than a 1. Visually it is a typical Hollywood horror movie akin to 'The Ring' or 'Cabin in the Woods' while lacking any originality to the story. It is a killer clown movie! Not much to expect! More backstory or actual scare factor would have gone a long way. There were lots of plot points that could have been explored further and possibly enhanced this waste of time. I think we, as a society, know that when the score drops to silence; something is going to pop out in an attempted jump scare. And gore does not equal scare! Twisty the clown from AHS: Freakshow and Pennywise from It had less screen time yet more scare factor than the clown in Clown. I honestly think this film would have been ten times better if the clown suit had 'won' rather than stereotypically defeated, not what I was expecting from Eli Roth. Cabin Fever was excellent! Looks like Roth is headed to meet M. Night at the intersection of big budget mediocrity and washed up ideas. Of course this is just my opinion, seems like a lot of people enjoyed it, I'm just not one of them."
