What if they had ruined it? Film-makers do that all the time. Not this time, I'm happy to report, it's perfect and I wanted to keep watching it over and over. Perfectly cast, beautifully told and not a moment too short or too long. Love it."

" Look at the essence of things!
",0.0,0.9536,2020-12-15 00:00:00,7,"Look at the essence of things! I hear the director shouting from the first frame to the last. He has a method. He uses clich√© situations of cinema to lead us to other interpretations of the characters and we must hold on and not get carried away and watch carefully. The first clich√© is the orphan Ove and his strange quiet father. But it was his father who taught him to love. He hugged him with his actions. He was always there for him. His guardian angel. He was proud of him. He taught him to fight if there was a need. He taught him good and evil and to claim. He taught him to claim the most beautiful girl. He did not teach him to hide. Nor to be ashamed. And she just fell in love with him. It was evident from how he was looking for her on the train and how he fully supported her disability till the end. Ove finds it difficult to break free from his grief. And it's been 6 months since he lost her. He still mourns for his father. That's why he's stuck with Volvo. When he says Volvo he says, Dad. I will not go into further details. As for the last letter left, so the writer and director could play with us. Did he finally commit suicide? And all these previous attempts were attempts or guilt part of the mourning for the love he lost. And what about a life you live when it is full of love?"
" Sentimental and uderstated at the same time

I was pleasantly surprised by strong acting and clever composition. All the ingredients were there, immigrants, gays, delinquent youth, old and ill, disabled persons and they were used as teaching moments, but it was ok, this is that kind of film. 21. century fairy tale for adults."
" Sweet, funny and sad...and destined to put a smile on your face.
",0.8126,0.9911,2020-11-03 00:00:00,9,"This Swedish comedy about a cantankerous man, old before his time and suicidal after losing his job but realising slowly that perhaps life, and people in general, aren't so bad after all, is a gem. It was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar and deservedly so and it's certainly much better than the overrated and not dissimilar ""Toni Erdmann"" and as the older Ove, Rolf Lassgard is miraculously good, (we also get to meet him as a child and a much younger man). Of course, an American version would be hugely sentimental but the Swedes don't really do sentimentality and this is sweet, funny and sad. Any tears it draws, it draws honestly. It's also beautifully directed by Hannes Holm in a series of short scenes designed to show Ove's character and that of his neighbours and it's sure to put a very large smile on your face."

Very pleasant and interesting main character to which you feel from the first minutes of the film. Minor characters are also interesting. The actor in the lead role fit perfectly. The only thing you can find fault with is flashbacks, they had some plot holes. Camera work is unremarkable, and editing in places is clumsy. But watching a movie does not spoil it at all. Who likes the genre of comedy drama, the film must really like!"

" Recovering human bonds in a touching and humorous way
",0.3818,0.9859,2020-07-02 00:00:00,8,"A 59-year-old Ove has become miserable after he lost his wife months ago. In despair, he tries to take his own life, but it is interrupted by the neighbors over and over again.Even though he is unreasonably taking it out on others, you will somehow like him from the beginning. He is a self-made man with a sturdy body, maverick and dignified, resentful of bureaucracy, and no doubt in deep grief over the loss.He becomes acquainted with a new neighbor Parvaneh, an Iranian immigrant, pregnant wife next door. She has a lot of things that she needs help with. She dosn't have DIY tools, she has two kids to take care of, and she can't drive a car. It's funny that when Ove is trying to die, Parvaneh keeps pestering him for help. It's funny and heartwarming how he finds reasons not to die.In flashback scenes we see his earlier life. But I don't think the past part is as good as the present part. When he is young, it must be in the 70s, but the scenes do not look like that. And some events are too dramatic to take seriously.Back in the present, he finds people who need help other than Parvaneh. Some are minorities of some kinds. And through helping him, always reluctantly though, he is recovering his trust in people. I also like the tranquiel atmosphere in the neighborhood where we see human bonds are becoming restored in a touching and humorous way."

" Ove's recipe how to change yourself.
",0.0,0.4601,2020-06-10 00:00:00,7,"This movie was an adaptation of the book ""The Man Called Ove"". I both read the book and watched the movie. I can't say I liked them but it's the case when you can say that you something could learn from that. I mean I noticed and observed a lot of things from this creation that could help me understand myself better or even to become a better person. I'm gonna write my review considering both the book and the movie. Btw, I have to say that the movie was made pretty close to the script of the book. It's a story of a man who lost his wife at the beginning of his sixties. The man called Ove and he decides to commit suicide because he doesn't see any sense of life without his wife. But all the time he tries to do that he was interrupted by his new neighbor, a young Persian woman who was pregnant. And between all these interruptions we're shown the moments from his past. So we're learning how he met his wife, whose name was Sonja, many details of their relationship. Once they had a road accident and due to that his wife becomes disabled and she couldn't walk anymore. In the book, the author says that Ove never had lived before he met his wife so after she had passed away Ove died inside again. You know, the author of the book tried to show Ove like a man who doesn't like to talk but rather prone to do. So he was a man of deeds but not words. Also, we're shown that Ove is addicted to rules. He always puts rules above people. His wife was an educated person unlike her, Ove never read a book. Besides being a quite educated person, Sonja was a beautiful woman who can choose any man. But for some reason she chose Ove. The author says that she chose him because he had looked at her like no one before, that she saw at him something real and sincere though Ove almost had never spoken. He spoke only when he needed to complain or whine about somebody or something that had broken some of his rules. As we can see he was kind of a bore. And he had nothing in common with his wife. I think that Sonja, like the majority of women, chose him just because she wanted to have by her side a responsible and reliable man. It always seems safe. Is it right? I think it's a matter of personal choice. So finally, the meeting of Ove with his Persian neighbor fully changed his life. He started to pay attention to the people around him and he changed his mind to commit suicide. So in summing up, I want to say that Ove, of course, couldn't be a role model, but at the same time, you could find some of Ove character traits in yourself, and then you could use the Ove's recipe how to change yourself."
" Very Different
",0.0,0.6704,2020-05-30 00:00:00,7,"I read the book before watching the movie and I liked some of the changes that were made for this movie, because the book was long and a little repetitive. And even though the movie gave us a proper ending, I would've liked to see Ove live out another four years of his life with people who loved him before he passed on. This made the movie seem a little incomplete to me. Next, I didn't like the pacing of the movie and it was like they quickly rushed towards the ending. However, this problem also exists in the book - but not as bad as the movie - so the screenwriters probably got the idea to rush through it from there."
" Outstanding Film

It was a great experience it takes you through all the emotions joy,anger, sadness
The main lead Rolf Lassg√•rd gave a great performance on the outside looked cranky and without empathy but through the film we see the true character and he had a big heart the rest of the cast were very good and you really cared about the characters
The direction is top notch and visually looks great

" Despite sentimental diversions, this tale of a wily curmudgeon has occasional moments of genuine pathos
",-0.2411,-0.9964,2019-09-06 00:00:00,6,"Released in 2016, A Man Called Ove was the Swedish entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards in 2017. Directed by Hannes Holm, it's based on Fredrik Backman's 2012 book of the same name. Rolf Lassg√•rd plays Ove, a curmudgeon in his 60s, the former president of a neighborhood association of townhouses in a Swedish suburb.
The film is a drama with occasional comic moments. Despite patrolling the neighborhood with gusto, constantly looking for transgressors who break the rules (including driving one's car too fast through the development), Ove is actually quite depressed (chiefly linked to the death of his wife six months earlier and more recent loss of his long time job as an engineer).
Each time Ove attempts to commit suicide (whether it's by hanging or asphyxiating himself by turning on the exhaust in his car for example), he's invariably interrupted by others who seek his help. His principal savior is Parvaneh,, an Iranian immigrant who's just moved in next door with her Swedish husband and two young children. She eventually gets Ove to open up after requesting favors of him including asking him to teach her how to drive and also babysit her kids.
Ove the film manages to have a big heart but eventually devolves into sentimentality. It's fairly predictable that the gruff Ove eventually will be able to let out his emotions, aided by Parvaneh, who makes him see that trying to kill himself is a bad idea, especially because he's someone who has much to offer.
The story also chronicles Ove's earlier life in a series of flashbacks-how he lost his mother as a young child and was close to his father who taught him how to repair car engines (one of Ove's life-long interests). Tragedy strikes a second time (the first being the death of his mother), when his father is hit by a passing train while on the job.
The third devastating tragedy is that his schoolteacher wife ends up paralyzed after their tour bus overturns on a vacation trip to Spain. Ida Engvoll is wonderful as Ove's young wife Sonja but has little to do in the part, which appears chiefly designed to evoke additional tears from an audience already inundated with a veritable heaping tablespoon of tragedy.
Ove's good character is made clear when he grudgingly helps others, which (in addition to his next door neighbor) also includes a friend of Sonja's former student who needs a place to stay after he reveals he's gay and is promptly kicked out of the house by an intolerant father.
Ove also saves a man who faints and falls on the train tracks. This leads to the resolution of the second act crisis, where Rune, Ove's rival, who took over as neighborhood association president, but is now semi-comatose after a stroke, is about to be put in a nursing home (against his wife's wishes), by ""whiteshirts"" (Ove's terms for heartless bureaucrats). A reporter who unsuccessfully attempts to interview Ove after he saved the man at the train station, ends up exposing the whiteshirts for some kind of real estate scam, and they back off sending Rune away.
The sentimental treatment of the handicapped Rune is coupled with additional comic asides which also don't work well at all (Ove's obsession with Saab cars over Volvos is one such example). Nonetheless, director Holm (who also wrote the screenplay), ends the narrative on the right unsentimental note: Ove initially appears to reach the end after collapsing and being diagnosed with an enlarged heart but manages to pull through, only to be found dead in his bed a few months later by his neighbors.
A Man called Ove features a top-notch performance by noted actor Rolf Lassg√•rd as the wily curmudgeon. Despite its sentimental moments, there's enough pathos here to sway even a critical film goer such as myself toward a modicum of approbation."

" Solid Adaptation Of A Spectacular Novel
",0.4404,0.9899,2019-05-15 00:00:00,8,"Not long before watching this film, I read the novel it is based on and was absolutely blown away by how the main character--Ove--could be rendered so crotchety yet also so heartfelt and sincere at the same time. For the most part, this film adaptation of ""A Man Called Ove"" captures the essence of that novel.For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of Ove (Rolf Lassgard), an old man in a gated community who seems to relish being the ""village grump"". He yells at cars for driving on ""the path"", does routine parking/garage inspections, and is just generally unpleasant to be around. Just when viewers couldn't imagine an ounce of sympathy for Ove, however, they discover he is grieving the loss of his wife, has just been laid off from his longtime job, and is on the verge of committing suicide. The rest of the film breaks down the middle, with one half flashing back to a young Ove (Filip Berg) and wife Sonja (Ida Engvoll) and roughly the other half a sort of redemption story for the present-day Ove, as new neighbors Patrick (Tobias Almborg) and Parvaneh (Bahar Pars) give him a chance at life again.As with the novel, the beauty of this story is that despite Ove's surly and often outright brutish personality, there is a relatability factor to him that just shouldn't be there (speaking to the incredible character nuance). Nobody really wants to be ""an Ove"", if you will, yet we all know someone like him or have been there a time or two in our own lives. The flashbacks really help to flesh out his backstory too, as it is fascinating to see a charismatic, hopeful Ove turn into the complicated figure of the present bit by bit.About the only thing I don't like about this film is how certain bits are played a bit too comedic for my liking. I understand the ridiculousness of Ove's situation in the first half of the film (constantly trying to die but always being ""thwarted"" by some problem or nuisance that needs solving), but in the novel it isn't played for quite as much comedy as it is at times here. It doesn't ruin the ambiance outright or anything like that, but it does feel a bit out of place in a film with such serious themes.Overall, though, I can see why ""A Man Called Ove"" was nominated for a Best Foreign Film Oscar (it is presented in Swedish dubbed in English). It's an emotional, deep, and yet somehow charming story of the life of a man we've all seen/known before and how he got that way."
" well made and good movie with a huge agenda
",0.743,0.9948,2019-03-17 00:00:00,9,"This was a well made and good movie with a huge agenda. it could have been made without showcasing a mid-movie coming out sequence for one character and without a refugee. it sadly detracts from a purely human experience movie in that those characters could have been anyone but the film makers chose to inject refugees. however, despite the infection by social justice tropes, the movie was meritorious. my wife was bawling - too bad i dont get to be her version of ove despite walking the line with her and the kids kind of like ove.and there was another review here that said 'who cares about car brands these days' - im half ove's age and yes, it does matter. where things are built and who builds them is how the world goes around. all the big tech big advertising companies who shall remain nameless who make all the ""billions"" take all the best, brightest and smartest people and they dont cure cancer - or make fusion energy a reality - or cure/treat autism - no, they shovel advertising in our faces. so yes it does matter what car your buy and where its made.i thought the movie was well above average and was enjoyable even with subtitles."

I absolutely loved the book. Then I watch the film and it seems like they made subtle changes to some characters, more significant changes to others, removed some parts of the book entirely and changed things around that, in my humble opinion, would have been much better left unchanged. The film failed to reach the same emotional level and love for the characters that the novel left me with. As a result, I found the film very lacking in many areas. I can only assume that those who rated this so highly did so without reading the book. So if you've not read the book, this may be a great film.

Guess that's why this is so easy to take in: everything seems nicely familiar, and well within one's comfort zone. Problem is, this is not funny enough for a comedy. See, comedy relies on the element of surprise, which this one doesn't offer. The story, lifted from the pages of a popular novel, recycles the age-old theme of a cantankerous old dude who hates the ways of the modern world. While the resourceful Rolf Lassg√•rd is in fine form in the lead, his character is too familiar to begin with. Director carefully follows the path well-travelled, which makes the whole movie seem more like a product than an actual work of art or self-expression. Cinematography, especially, is way too generically ""well-balanced"".The few merits of the movie include the cast - and the ending, which is - finally - a little bit touching. Too little, too late."
" Good movie, but not as good as the book
",-0.2867,0.9428,2018-02-26 00:00:00,7,"I recently listened to the audiobook version of the novel by Fredrik Backman (narrated by George Newbern) so I went into the movie knowing what was going to happen. While this did give me a ""comparing"" perspective that I wouldn't typically have, I was still able to settle in and enjoy it.The main actors are terrific and carry the movie. While he's not exactly what I pictured when listening to the book (Ove is characterized as appearing more physically imposing and less ""soft""), Rolf Lassg√•rd really nails the most important role in the film. Bahar Pars, while less is asked of her acting-wise, is equally wonderful in the role of Parvaneh. Other than Sonja the rest of the other actors are forgettable in their roles.This movie held up to my expectations for most of the way through, but the ending fell short of the impact that I felt with the book and due to that I'd consider this more of a ""good"" movie than ""great"" one.In directly comparing to the book there are a number of details outside of the main Ove/Sonja narrative that had to be left out, which of course is expected. What I do feel that the movie lacks is being able to explain the relationships that Ove has with the other people in his life (outside of Sonja and Parvaneh). Some of those are equally powerful in showing Ove's strong moral compass and at the same time explaining why he acts the way he does."
" Watchable but overrated
",0.0,-0.973,2018-02-24 00:00:00,5,"This is one of those movies where you hate to criticize it because there are so few movies nowadays that are effecting and tell a story for grown-ups. And for the first two-thirds or so the film IS absorbing, and the characters are touching. The humor of a man who, try as he may, cannot kill himself, is hard to resist.
But in the end, this curmudgeon-becomes-loving-and-lovable story feels hackneyed and false. Ove rails against the bureaucracy of the ""whiteshirts,"" but as many have pointed out when asked, ""What did people do before the government got involved in (fill in the blank),""... well, they were abused, or were poisoned, or were killed. I don't know -- maybe it's a Swedish thing of an overbearing state, and there is a real risk of the infirm being carted away by money-minded caretakers (or at least there was one such story in the papers). But Ove's world view seems rather like that of a (rather unappealing) Idaho separatist.
Moreover, I felt cheated that the fact his wife spent her adult life in a wheelchair wasn't disclosed until near the end. It would have come up more naturally earlier in the story, and leaving it for last felt like manipulation.
Again, the movie is certainly watchable, or at least most of it. But ultimately I think it is a failure, and its rating among critics too high."
" A mixed result
",0.0,0.7826,2018-02-19 00:00:00,6,"In a Swedish townhouse community, Ove (Rolf Lassgard) is a long-time resident who is recently widowed. His grief only adds to his grouchy attitudes toward people who don't follow his standards of community living. His new neighbours are a young mixed-race family co-lead by Parvaneh (Bahar Pars), a very pregnant immigrant from Iran.Some of the best scenes in the film are those told in flashback as they explain how Ove developed such a negative attitude. The story (screenplay by Hannes Holm based on the book by Fredrik Backman) has a clever way of making us curious about finding the pieces of the past with various hints in the current story; and then satisfying our curiosity once such events are revealed in the parallel flashback story.Parvaneh's character is a bit of an anomaly. She can sometimes be annoying and take Ove for granted. Yet, the story seems to imply that she is there to ""humanize"" him. This might have worked better if her character had been more developed. Instead, too much time is spent on other subplots, sideshows and other characters that end up overcrowding the narrative. Some of the subplots also seem to be resolved unusually quickly.There seem to be messages like ""you can't go through life alone"" and themes of 'community values' which may be noble but their repetitions become didactic and annoyingly obvious and sentimental. Other themes work better such as the recurrence of administrators-from-hell (""whiteshirts"" as Ove calls them), the insensitive bureaucrats that we can all recognize: Satan in multiple human forms.The conclusion is touching as it makes us have a better understanding about people who appear grouchy. Also, Lassgard gives a fine performance. But overall, the movie was rather mixed. The dramatic scenes are much better than the comedy scenes. Call me old-fashioned but I just don't find humour in repeatedly thwarted suicide attempts."

He doesn't hoard, like others might, he just insists on the following of rules, both by himself and everyone else. He clearly sees himself as the ideal Swede even to the point of only ever driving a Saab. Early in his life, he recognises another man of similar age who seems to share his obsessions....all is well until the other man, who has defiantly had a series of Volvo cars, buys a BMW. This is the final straw and the two men refuse to have anything to do with the other...despite their shared principles. This is just the surface patina of an ocean of feelings that Ove cannot share as his wife has departed without him. He tends her grave daily and, almost as often, tries to commit suicide in order to be with her again. He is comically inept at this task and is tested sorely by the arrival of a mixed race family who take up residence next door. Through interactions with them, we get to learn of Ove's traumatic and sad life experiences and the joy that his wife Sonja represented to him. The whole is a masterclass in story telling and visual representation. You'll weep but only after laughing heartily at some of Ove's exploits. Well done!"

Holm gently matches beautiful material, emotional heft, and loving melodrama all in one and it's wonderful. Ove (Rolf Lassg√•rd) is the grumpy man of the block ‚Äì a 59-year-old retiree, who several years before the film's setting had been kicked out of the Condominium Association, yet he still angrily enforces rules for the isolated community, this turns him into the most hated man on the block. He writes down rules in his handy notepad, stops cars, and refuses to do the simplest tasks. He blames his wife's death on everyone and everything around him; he's always angry, shouting at people and terrifying animals. This perfect characterization comes with a flaw, he's terribly lonely, visiting the grave of recently deceased wife, and he tries to commit suicide. Until new neighbours move in. A young family of four. The young woman of this new family, Parvaneh (Bahar Pars) wants to meet her new neighbour, Ove doesn't want to know. Character-wise Ove is a lot like As Good As It Gets' Melvin Udall, he hates everyone and everything, until someone special takes a hold of his heart ‚Äì that is Parvaneh and her two children. He starts to get used to her, he teaches her to drive, and he vows to baby-sit. And it's wonderful. Holms' direction is polished to near perfection, he handles Ove's story with fierce hands, there's no heavy touch, the way his camera moves through the community, the cemetery the detail is exquisite. It excels in its redemption tale setting, it's made with love, carefully mixing melodrama with dark comedy and Holm makes it work well. The material used from the novel is used beautifully. There's sympathy for him as visits his wife's grave, and as he wills to commit suicide. He's hilarious too, with his deadpan expression he's hilarious in his behaviour he utters the word idiot to passers-by, he imitates a Chihuahua plus his rivalry with people who own foreign cars is exceptionally funny. And he's emotional, thanks to timely flashbacks that carefully construct his life from the death of his mother, through growing up with his father, to the meeting of his wife, which combined with Lassg√•rd's tour de force performance is a perfect storyteller. A Man Called Ove excels in brilliance, it's an incredibly human comedy which captures true sentiment and fires it like an arrow at your heartstrings; this could be one of the best films of the year by far. VERDICT: Flawless performances help convert this lovable tale onto the silver screen, with excellent execution in true sentiment and emotional heft."

",0.0,0.3964,2017-05-01 00:00:00,5,"I saw this movie subtitled in English and I was disappointed in the inadequate transfer of the book of the same name to the screen. In the English translation of the book, the story captures the cultural and emotional nuances of Ove's relationships and interactions within his neighborhood. Ove is not only portrayed as cantankerous and intolerant, he is also a warm, tolerant and generous human being who is dealing with significant grief. The book covers his many relationships within his neighborhood in much detail and it is from these that we learn the warm side of Ove. Some of these more significant relationships (e.g. Jimmy)are brushed over in the movie and therefore don't build the richness that is evident in the book. I suppose it's always a big ask to capture in film what makes such a successful book as A Man Called Ove. However, it's not impossible (e.g. Last Orders by Graham Swift). These criticisms aside, Rolf Lassgard as Ove (senior) and Filip Berg as Ove (younger) give commendable performances, Bahar Pars as Parvaneh less so. I wanted more from this movie however it wasn't to be."

" A special man with his own personality
",0.4019,0.9961,2017-04-08 00:00:00,7,"This is a funny movie, perhaps it is tragic comedy somehow. The story is about a man that has a life full of bad events outside his control. When he is really young his mother dies and he is left alone with his father. So he grows up with his father. It seems as they only talk cars and not much more, but his father says that it is the only thing he needs to know in order to get by. In a way that seems more right, considering the outcome of his life events. You will understand it, when you see the film. Anyway, this movie really starts off when Ove is a older man living on his own. He looses his job and his life takes another turn. But on this way we get to see flashbacks to the life Ove has lived. The flashbacks make us understand Ove a bit more. I would consider it as Ove had a hard life, but he seems to have adapted to circumstances. He has also been good in accomplishments, when he has set a goal. You will understand that too, if you see the movie. I laughed a lot in this film, then at times it was tragic and there was nothing to really laugh about. It is about life, both joy and sadness and how you as a person can handle it. We are all different. Ove has his routines and we could say he likes routines. Every week he visits his wife's grave and talks to her. He tells her what is going on, as if she was still alive. I consider Ove a simple man, he likes his routines. Who doesn't? Ove is no different from other's that like routines. But then a new family moves in to the neighboring house and Ove's routines are changed. So what happens when Ove's routines change? Is it changing differently than all other strange events in his life? Well Ove is a interesting man. I would say a strong man, a man that adapts to the circumstances given. I like this routine-like movie with comedy and sorrow. It is a about a possible life, a life that someone could have. Ove is a unique person, who dares to be himself. I wish you do too. If you want to enjoy a good story in happiness and tears, then perhaps A man named Ove could help you with that? The part of Ove is well played, the actor seems like he is Ove himself. He makes laughter and convinces the viewer he is ""Ove"", even though it is all just fiction. It is not an action, it is not a drama, even though this tragedy contains drama too. It has a melancholic feel to it, but yet enjoyable with the possibility to bring laughter to those small moments of joy."

I absolutely loved this film.It portrays the life of 59-year-old Ove as he gives up on life; his routine is interspersed with scenes of his past that tell us how he has become the man he is today. I have to say the performances were right on top. The two actors that portrayed this character were right on. I can see how the young Ove became the older one and why he resents everything and everyone - the light of his life, who made him the way he is, has gone.I thought this would be more depressing than it actually was. Yes, there were moments when I got teary-eyed because you can't help but relate to this guy and everything he is and has been through. However, I laughed out loud in more than one occasion and so did other folks in the audience. At the same time it is so tender and touching. Ove struggles all the way but his new neighbours, particularly the mom with her perpetual sunny smile on her face who is not afraid to rant right back at him cannot help but snap his out of his bad humour and make Ove open up to life.The photography is beautiful. The pace is as well. I thought there would be slow moments but there was no such thing. The scenes are every-day stuff for the most part but the interactions of Ove with other characters or animals or even his monologues at his wife's grave always have an element or two to perk things up, usually Ove's humour.There were only a couple of things I thought were overdone, like the bureaucratic character that seemed too vilified and a few other occasions that were exacerbated for comical value. However even despite that I cannot recommend this movie enough. It really is brilliant, a work of art. I am sure there is something in it that everyone can relate to."

When we first see Ove bossing people around in his living complex, we know none of the backstory. But this is slowly revealed and we see someone who has a decent set of personal values that have been passed down by his father. He lives by these and expects others in the community to do the same. At first we think he is just a stickler for little things, but with the arrival of the new family next door, we soon find it is not little things that set him off, but only little things that represent major issues. I can see Ove as a great union steward, looking after his men and at the same time being loyal and hard working for his employer. Communities are built this way. The children next door immediately pick up on his inner nature, they are truly adorable. You can see that they immediately absorb is orderly and empathetic view of the world."
" Swedish curmudgeon warms to nice immigrant family
",0.5994,0.7559,2017-03-21 00:00:00,6,"A Man Called Ove is a feel-good Swedish comedy that sidles up to the very serious problem of unassimilating immigrants from the Middle East ‚Äî and the Swedes' increasing fear of them ‚Äî then sappily slinks away, toothless. Ove's community of townhouses is a miniature of the regimented Swedish welfare state. Though deposed as board chair, Ove angrily continues to enforce the regulations. Rather than helping his neighbours, Ove refuses their requests and prefers vigilante law-enforcement. The film's central thrust is to discover the tragedy that created this bitter, selfish, righteous jerk. At the end, Ove not only abandons his own isolation but organizes the entire community to thwart the institutional attempt to take away his paralyzed old friend/enemy Rune. The flashbacks reveal Ove to have been a promising, solitary, nervous young man. He lost his mother as a boy, saw his father killed by a train while bragging about Ove's report card and stumbled into a marriage with the beautiful, smart Sonja. A bus crash aborts their child and leaves Sonja paralyzed. When she dies of cancer, Ove is encrusted with rage. If Sonja seems too good a catch for the unpromising Ove, her later career as a special needs teacher suggests she intuits potential others don't. Even Ove doesn't know his own continuing value, as his failures at suicide reveal. Hence neighbour Parvaneh's conclusion: ""You're amazingly crap at dying."" Parvaneh is the film's crucial center: a pregnant Persian who fled Iran, married an affable but clumsy Swede and just became Ove's neighbour. Ove initially rages against the new family's incompetence, ignorance of the community's laws and rowdiness. He's warmed into accepting them. Their interchange represents traditional Sweden's encounter with immigrants from the Middle East. But this immigrant is a heavily sentimentalized soft-focus version of the immigration that is rupturing Sweden. Parvaneh is the idealized immigrant, with her two lovable Persian children to thaw Ove's heart, her tasty Persian cooking, her eagerness to join and to enjoy her new community. Director Hannes Holm's point is that this Other, an immigrant from that very different culture, is no threat to Sweden's traditional virtues but the opportunity for their renewal. This simplification undermines film's exhortation to embrace the immigrant. Because Sweden's threat is not from anyone like Parvanah, the domesticated, safe form of the Other, but from the violent jihadists and rapists that impose their old culture's values instead of accepting those of their new land. So the film does not really treat with the issue as it is problematically occurring but plays it in a much simpler, easier form. In sentimentalizing the immigrant the film ignores the real issue it purports to address. This sentimentalizing pervades the film. As if Parvanah's two little daughters were not enough to register Ove's revived feeling, he first confronts and threatens, then eventually adopts and sleeps with yet another Persian ‚Äî the stray cat. So, too, the running joke about Ove's passionate commitment to the Saab automobile brand. That traditional value he inherited from his father. Its advantage is another metaphor for stasis: its mechanism does not require the propeller rod others do. If brand preference is a minor difference, here it balloons. Ove clashes with his kindred neighbour Rune when the latter opts for the Volvo family. The men's deepening hostility reflects in their graduation to higher models in their respective brands. Then Rune does the indefensible: embracing the German. When Ove rails against the German and the French cars, the film satirizes jingoism and belligerent nationalism as lightly and as safely as it did the issue of immigration. This very engaging, pleasant and reassuring film is fine ‚Äî except for occupying the space and time that would have been better invested in a serious treatment of the issue it cites but evades."

It was directed and written by Hans Holm, and it's based on the 2012 book, of the same name, by Fredrik Backman. The film stars Rolf Lassgard, Bahar Pars and Filip Berg. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also been nominated for multiple prestigious awards (including Best Foreign Language Film, at the 2017 Academy Awards). I enjoyed it.Ove Lindahl (Lassgard) is a 59-year-old widower, who's still grieving over the death of his wife (from six months earlier). To make things worse, he's forced to retire from his job (which he's worked at for 43 years). This pushes Ove to obsessively want to commit suicide, but he fails every time he attempts it (usually due to interruptions from his neighbors). Ove slowly starts to bond with these neighbors, despite being an extremely hard man to get along with, as he also constantly recollects on his past life.The movie is touching and surprisingly humorous. I'd even say it's more of a comedy than a drama, but that doesn't mean the characters aren't sympathetic still, or the drama isn't heartfelt (because those things are certainly true as well). The performances are all good, especially Lassgard in the lead, and it's definitely a well directed film.

" A darkly funny portrait of love and grief in a cranky old man.
",0.5994,0.8756,2017-02-24 00:00:00,8,"The cranky old man stereotype is universally found in fairy tales and films and are abundant in real life. They are easy targets to laugh at, pity, or to incite fear, and their grumpiness, loneliness, and declining relevance fuels their image. As if aging itself was not undignified enough, old men are also often depicted as mad or heading in that direction. In this context, A Man Called Ove (2016) is an unusually sympathetic, darkly funny, and insightful essay on the inner life of a lonely old man, playfully blended with themes of multi-culturalism in homogenous Swedish society.Ove (Rolf Lassgard) is the self-appointed superintendent of rules and manners in a small Swedish neighbourhood where everyone knows everybody. Having recently lost his wife to cancer and then retrenched after a lifetime on the railways, he is seriously suicidal. He fills his time by policing minor breaches of community rules with his gruff rebukes that keep the neighbourhood orderly. His daily patrols, helping the neighbours, and visiting his wife's grave are the only things keeping him alive. His tormented peace is disturbed when a noisy Iranian family move in next door. Even worse, they seem to be lovely people with nice children and they bring gifts of friendship at inconvenient times. Their arrival temporarily distracts Ove from his death-wish and whenever he readies the noose he is again interrupted by someone who needs him. Ove is always helping others while his own inner turmoil goes unrecognised.This simple, uneventful plot line is merely the picture frame for one of the most poignant portraits of grief you will find on film. While there is comedy aplenty in watching Ove relate to others, the deeper layers are anything but funny. The emotional pivot points of the story are Ove's grief and his promise to soon join his wife. If you are looking for comedy it is easy to miss glimpses of his deep despair mixed with his undiminished love for his wife. The acting comes from the school of understated realism and it avoids the melodrama that usually accompanies the grief genre. With deadpan Swedish gravitas, the most ordinary gesture, like Ove looking at his wife's photo or chatting at her graveside, is deeply moving. Frequent flashbacks fill out the story of Ove's life and towards the end of the film it is impossible to see him as just a cranky old man. The new family has given his life new meaning, and there are many beautiful moments shared between Ove and his pregnant neighbour. But he is always haunted by the promise to join his wife.There is a fine line between formulaic melancholy and the lyrical depiction of deep emotion. The Swedes are renown for doing deadpan comedy with dramatic force, and this trait shines in Ove. Little happens in terms of narrative propulsion, and any claim to originality is tenuous. The sheer force of the film lies in a lonely man's memories expressed through Ove's wide-eyed face. Some viewers may feel emotionally manipulated but that would be a harsh judgement. This is an outstanding film about universal emotions that all of us at some time will witness or experience."

Ove promises to join his beloved, and, early on, he places a rope around his neck, steps on to a stool and, without giving away the result, begins a sometimes funny and often sad and sentimental journey told through flashbacks of his life with Sonja. He meets the beautiful young lady on a train and they marry and he works for the railroad and she finishes college to become a teacher. Ove becomes the neighborhood's rule enforcer and head of the town council. His new neighbor is a Swedish man with an Iranian wife with two little girls. At first he resents the lively and sometimes noisy and happy family, but after getting to know them, he discovers that they are good and decent human beings who really care about him. I was drawn into Ove's world and Lassgard is perfectly cast in the lead role as the lonely and bitter man. This has a good chance to be the best foreign film at the Academy Awards and I would not argue the choice."
" Would Have Preferred a Less Overtly Sentimental Approach
",0.2551,0.9078,2017-02-15 00:00:00,7,"Ove is a cranky old dude who has good reason to be so, given the hand life has dealt him. ""A Man Called Ove"" is a film about understanding that people's behavior takes place in a context that we will have a greater or lesser understanding of depending on how well we know that person's history. It's a message I appreciated, but the package it's wrapped in is a bit twee and saccharine for my taste. The film works overtime pushing emotional buttons, especially in its last 20 minutes or so, when what it really needed was some good old-fashioned Scandinavian austerity.Grade: B"
" Absolutely stunning!
",0.4914,0.977,2017-02-09 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie got an Oscar nomination for the Best Foreign Movie and decided to watch it. And I have to say I'm blown away!Beautiful story, great actors, the characters are very well developed, smart humor. I was both laughing and crying while watching it. Actually I can't remember when was the last time I cried so much at the end of any movie. It reminds me a little bit of my favorite movie - Intouchables (France). It is also both very entertainment and touching. I've seen few Sweedish films but this one is undoubtedly the best one. It's also my favorite for the Oscars. I can highly recommend it to anyone!"
" A heart-warming life story
",0.0,-0.2538,2017-01-26 00:00:00,9,"This is a story of a ridiculously grumpy and constantly irritated and annoyed old man who is a creature of habits, a perfectionist but also a lonely and sad man who recently lost his life partner, so he doesn't want to be a part of this world any longer.What makes you compassionate with Ole is his rough events throughout his whole life. They gradually appear and slowly show the other side of an angry, frustrated man whom you then actually start to sympathize. He manages to find a key to his inner peace, even though he wasn't looking for it. All he had to do was open his heart once again.You shouldn't judge a book by its cover. You should give everyone a chance to bring light in your life, even when you seem that it's too late to get anything fixed. What everyone deserves is a peaceful life and eventually a peaceful death. These are the things I've learned or at least remembered myself while watching this wonderful movie."
" The life after the loved one departed.
",0.5994,0.9995,2017-01-24 00:00:00,8,"This is a Swedish film based on the book of the same name. It is sent to represent the nation at the 2017 Oscars and as for now, it made into the December shortlist. This is the tale of an old grumpy man and the life after the death of his wife. That would be a toughest phase of life for anybody. I am sure you had seen many films like this, but this one was slightly different, yet totally convincing on every topic it focused on. So funny, at a time meaningful and emotional, particularly how the tale ends.In a small township, a 59 year old man called Ove lived most of his life and now he decides to take his life. But the attempt was prevented when a new lousy neighbour arrives and so it keep delays further. Now's the time to reveal all the reasons behind his dreadful decision with lots of flashbacks and current affairs. That he's a nightmare in his neigbourhood to those who break the rules. He's not a friendly type, because of his childhood and the lessons he learnt from his father to face the life as tough it gets.The only friend he ever had did not last for a long. His wife was his world and then the job at the railway. The narration given a good enough focus on his romance life. His younger version, played by another actor reveals particularly the initial stage like how he had met her. I don't know these actors, but they all were so good. A perfect setting as well for the story to take place. I think the filmmakers did lots of best decisions and in the end it all paid off with a greater recognition in the international level.""Honesty is the best thing, Ove. But sometimes honesty needs a little help.""A heartwarming comedy-drama for all age groups. I was looking for such a film and I realised only after watching it. The character Ove was designed awesomely and all the story events built around him was excellent. Covered most of the topics like friendship, love, neighbours, job, moral values, even the pet animals. Loads of fun, guaranteed entertainment if you are seeking a comedy film. As Ove was portrayed very seriously, all his actions, especially the newly arrived woman make major difference to end the film most comedic way.The regularly visiting his wife's grave, the film beautifully gives an insight on the life of Ove being a widower and a retiree. But also how it all turns around for him who never laughs and finally he does, was the film's highlight. Like I always say, I'm not a book person, but I love watching films based on the good books like this one. An awesome adaptation and I hope those who loved the book, as well enjoyed the film.Usually all the good films run nearly or over two hours. Because of the slow and steady developments in its characters and the story. For this film, you won't notice the time. The pace of the narration, including the lovable characters and the storyline makes you forget everything else. In a few days the 89th American Academy Awards nominees will be announced and I am sure it will make. Looks like this year, three Scandinavian films going to make the noise at the Oscars. In the meantime, I hint you not to miss it, either it wins or lose, it is one of the best films of the year around the world.8/10"
" Lovely Conventional Movie
",0.5859,0.9805,2017-01-17 00:00:00,7,"This was a lovely, conventional film. No, really it's a movie rather than a film. And while Swedish, it reads very conventional Hollywood. Movie comfort food, if you will. Very nice, and a total feel-good movie for all ages. It leaves one feeling all warm and fuzzy. And besides that, well, that's about it. What stays with me? A sad sense of longing for community, so very rare today, especially in the USA.Scoring the different elements of the film objectively, 1 to 4:Script/Story: 3.5 - nice, well constructed. Loved the fact that flashbacks ride on scenes of suicide attempts. This was a nice, ironic feature of the narrative.Cinematography/Visual Effects: 3 - conventional, competently shot. Not much more to say.Editing: 3 - See above (heavy sigh -- conventional, competently edited. Not much more to say.)Sound Effects: 2 - forgettable, nothing significant here.Musical Score: 2.5, at times stereotypical, ie Spanish-y music for scenes set in Spain, etc. Competent, but not significant, which is very appropriate for the narrative structure.Performances: 3.5, strong performances.Production Design: Sets, Locations, Costumes, etc.: 3.5, production design great, iconic for the area and period feel of the storyline. But an Oscar consideration in hair & make-up, really??? What am I missing here?Would I recommend this movie to a friend? Of course, total movie comfort food! Sweden's Terms of Endearment or Forrest Gump or . . ."
" Life is great: the world is wonderful
",0.8316,0.9851,2017-01-17 00:00:00,9,"Using a reasonable amount of flashback to reveal the history of the main character, superficially this is a film about a grumpy old man who gets redeemed by how he ends up helping his neighbours... but for any viewer with even a minute amount of human empathy it teaches us that even the most apparently obnoxious person can have hidden depths that are worth revealing. Everything about this film is well executed and beautifully measured. It could have been more humorous; more sentimental and clich√©d - but the director kept everything under subtle control, and in the process he and his cast delivered a memorable film that left me feeling life is great: the world is wonderful. Thank you."
" Un-formulaic dramedy that restores one's hope for humanity
",0.6249,0.9754,2017-01-16 00:00:00,8,"I absolutely love it when a movie dares diverge from the formula that has served so many comedies and dramedies through decades: we all know it - two people who are each other's opposites have to reluctantly find a way to get along and eventually end up actually liking each other, but not before a big fight 15 minutes before the end. Well, thankfully there's nothing of the sort here in this movie, which makes the plot fairly unpredictable and thoroughly enjoyable. Lassg√•rd is particularly admirable for managing to give his grumpy old man a layer of humanity that makes you stick with him even after he's showcased his unnerving brand of neighborhood watch fascism a few times."
" evolve your relations
",0.0,0.9692,2017-01-01 00:00:00,9,"Some of the movies that I find the most interesting are ones that focus on interactions between people from different cultures. ""En man som heter Ove"" (""A Man Called Ove"" in English) is one such movie. The protagonist is a misanthropic, aging man in a neighborhood in Sweden. He spends much of his time telling people if they're breaking the law. But when an Iranian woman and her family move in, this becomes a new opportunity for him.In addition to showing Ove's relationship with this new family, the movie uses flashbacks to establish what kind of a person Ove is. And believe me, there are some shocking things that happened in this man's life. I had never heard of the director or cast members before watching the movie, but I'm impressed with their work (including the cat). The movie has some clever scenes, but also makes sure to emphasize the characters' relationships with each other. I hope that Hannes Holm continues to make this sort of movie, and I hope to see Rolf Lassg√•rd in more movies. Bra gjort!"
" Just okay
",0.2263,0.8986,2017-01-01 00:00:00,6,"This was OK. I'm sure if it were redone in English with, say, Brian Cox in the title role, it would be roundly criticized as mawkishly sentimental and nothing new. In fact, the story of a curmudgeon and his back story was almost certainly done before. And I agree that his personality was an expected result of his much-more outgoing and loving wife's death. So, that's it, you get the feeling that you've seen this one before except that the upbeat Iranian woman was probably Hispanic. Typical of foreign films, it's underplayed, but when you get right down to it, it's familiar and unsurprising.The actor who played Ove was good. The music, if there was any, was unobtrusive and forgettable. I've seen many worse movies of course, but the praise for this one is a bit hard to understand. If you like sentimental stories, you could do worse, but I just don't see anything special here."
