" Amazing psychological thriller
",0.6369,0.0516,2021-03-06 00:00:00,9,I don't understand why this movie gets this many negative reviews. I loved this movie.
" Not bad but not good.
",-0.2924,-0.9075,2020-08-23 00:00:00,6,"Whether it's the unbelievably poor acting or the incredibly slow pace you can't help but feel something is lacking in this film.
Possibly that it takes ages to evolve to something that could or should take about 20 minutes. Guy and wife buy house and have kid, wife starts having affair (yeah didn't see that one coming) wife ends up dead...this is where it starts to get wierd... There's pretty much no sadness from the husband or child and he spends more of his time freaking out over ghostly nightmares and visions regarding murder... So is this a whodunit? Is it a horror? Is it a thriller? Watch it and be impressed or bored to tears."
" Way better than average.
",0.4404,-0.2263,2020-08-17 00:00:00,8,"You might recognize Rupert from Hellboy. That's the only other movie I've seen him in until this outing. As an American, everyone else is new to me but the cast is talented to be sure.This film is creep AF. The finale shows you things that you may have to answer for after you die. Just saying."
" Incredibly amateur student production
",0.0,0.6486,2020-07-28 00:00:00,1,"Aside from what others have said about this film's narrative being unbelievably predicatble and essentially offering up the obvious at the start only to lead you to the exact same result is mind boggling. It is incredibly derivative and uninspired storytelling.Add to that, the intentions of paying homage to the likes of Argento and DePalma are painfully obvious and painfully amateurish trying to bring them up to the Edgar Wright era of editing techniques. Everything feels like a student production and I would be honest in saying it made me feel that if I were to try and make something like this by paying respects to the iconic aforementioned names, it would sadly probably end up like this, thus proving it would take skill to pull this off."
" Pretty cool, easy 6.
",0.8126,0.155,2020-06-26 00:00:00,6,"I liked it, and I can't remember last time I said that about a horror movie. There's some really cool scares in this one. Just really cool stuff. I was impressed.The issue with this movie is it is the same old tired storyline we've seen a thousand times before. What makes this a standout is that it pulls that story off better then most other movies I've seen.Recommended if you've gone through movies that I rate higher then a 6."
" The twist you see from a mile away
",0.0,0.3307,2020-06-24 00:00:00,3,"That's it. That's the review. I could talk about good performances that aren't enough to cut through the fluff, but that twist. You know the one."
" Decent
",0.0,0.9366,2020-05-28 00:00:00,5,"Not overly inspired, but worthy of a watch. It meanders between supernatural and psychosis. Nothing wrong with any one aspect but just seems like it never really gripped me enough to really enjoy."
" I liked it! Just not that much!
",0.5242,-0.84,2020-05-07 00:00:00,5,"There's an aspect of the supernatural to this one but there didn't really need to be. It just as easy could have been a mental illness character study. It also could have gone into more of an occult / ritual based movie. Was it scary? Not really. It had a few moments but there could have been more of them. At least it didn't de-evolve into some runninng jumping screamfest. It's a decent watch, just not a lot of reward."
" Not bad at all..
",0.431,0.8955,2020-04-22 00:00:00,7,"Not much of a horror.. More like a psychological thriller.. Good storyline, good casting, an intense suspense is there to keep you gripped till the end.. Good job director and actors"
" Dull and uninspired
",-0.4019,-0.5637,2019-09-14 00:00:00,1,"Just another ""boring white man loses his s*** and murders his family"" movie. He had no personality, and the people around him were little more than mobile props for his manpain. Would've been at least a little more interesting if he hadn't been the killer."
" A Psychological Masterpiece with Gore
",0.6249,0.9487,2019-09-06 00:00:00,8,"Despite some of the poor reviews I've read here, I found this to be a completely coherent and excellent psychological Thriller/Horror movie! Yes you will see some themes borrowed from other films, but let's be honest every movie does that. The cinematography was amazing. The score was arranged with a lot of attention to details and made it perfect backdrop to the film. Transitions and shadows were creepy and eerie. About the only thing that annoyed me what's the editing in which the way the editor wood chop out frames causing a time jump effect. This worked okay as a transition but awful during actress dialogue. All in all it was a great movie."
" Decent Supernatural Mystery
",0.0,0.9668,2019-09-01 00:00:00,8,"This was a film that I first heard about when I got into listening to podcasts. It was on an episode where they were talking about films from Ireland for St. Patty's Day. I didn't hear about this film when it came out so I was intrigued to finally give it a viewing. The synopsis is a depressed and stressed film archivist finds his sanity crumbling after he is given an old 16mm film reel with footage from a horrific murder that occurred in the early 1900's.We start this film with David (Rupert Evans) and Claire (Antonia Campbell-Hughes) as they're talking to a group of students in an auditorium. To get their attention, they ask if the kids what to see a ghost, as they're going to show them archived films from the late 1800's to the early 1900's. He tells them they're ghosts as the footage is of people who have passed away. It is an interesting way to start this film with what happens and I never thought of this concept either. I think it kind of sets the tone.David is married to Alice (Hannah Hoekstra). They have a son, Billy (Calum Heath). Every morning David walks his son to school and they pass a public bathroom. It is full of graffiti and quite dirty. Billy thinks there's a ghost in there, but David tells him there's not. They continue on.The couple goes to a party for Alice's work and has a babysitter, Sophie (Kelly Byrne) come to watch Billy. Things take a turn where David is suspicious of a man who talks with his wife at the party. His name is Alex (Carl Shaaban) and he thinks there's something up. There's also an awkward moment where a co-worker is kind of rude to David as well.At work, David is given the task of watching some older films to be archived. They're old police footage and it interests him to see that it is in their house. Apparently, there was a murder back in 1902 where a man killed his wife after he found her having an affair. He stabbed her over 50 times in a rage and threw her body in the canal by their house.Things take a turn when David is suspicious of his wife and her co-worker. He decides to follow her and he sees she's having an affair. He goes into the public restroom to throw up and a man comes in. As David attempts to leave, he sees this man attacking his wife by the canal. In the end, she's pushed in. David goes home and showers. When his wife doesn't show up, he goes to the police. He starts to lose his mind as they search for where she could have gone. He learns some dark truths about her and the house they've been living in. The question is what really happened to Alice and is David really seeing the things that he is or is this all in his head?Now I wanted to go slightly vague here on the recap as I think there's a good mystery. The idea of this film is something that I really was done for. I like that David is a film archivist, because it gives him a reason to accidentally learn about what happened in his house. The movie also has some interesting editing, as we see some events revealed to us as if David is actually watching a film. I thought this was an interesting way to show us things. Since this is a possible descent into madness film, we get those reveals of the truth and I dug the different way of showing it.Going from there, I do love the mystery here. Alice is murdered, but the police think it is an accident. I like that David has to decide to agree with them or try to figure out what really happened. He's convinced there are ghosts at play and I like seeing all of that supernatural. There's an aspect here though of is there really ghosts or is this David just losing it? This is kind of a movie trope though that is a bit overplayed at times. I don't think this falls into that if I'm honest, especially with how things end.There are some plot-holes that I had though. An example is that there is a hammer found in the canal that ends up belonging to Alex. The police state that the death of Alice was an accident, but then they find a hammer with fingerprints on it. There were no talks of blunt force trauma, so why would they be looking still in the canal? On top of that, in water the fingerprints would be washed away so there's no way that would happen. This was something that when I heard it made me question.I want to move next to the pacing of the film, which I think for the most part, was good. The film has a good mystery. I really wanted to get to the bottom of what was going on here and figure out if this is a scorned lover or a supernatural thing happening. The problem becomes though we don't get a lot explained. There's a picture that is discovered that kind of gives a bit of an idea, but the film kind of just loses itself. It is such a whirlwind of David seeing things that I think it loses it way a bit. It doesn't ruin the film, but just something that I had a slight issue with. The ending was something that is quite dark and I dug that.That moves me next to the acting. I thought Evans was really solid. I believed him in his grief, but there's also a bit of madness to him as he digs deeper. I thought it was well casted role here. Campbell-Hughes is fine as someone trying to help him. There's also the vibe that she is interested in him as well. Hoekstra was gorgeous. I did hate her character for her cheating, but it doesn't mean she should die. It did get a reaction out of me which I always want. Steve Oram was solid as McNamara, the detective who is assigned to the case. He's mistrustful, which really does fit the character. I thought Byrne was fine, Heath was alright for a child actor, he didn't really blow me away. I'd say the rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed.As for the effects of the film, I thought that they looked good. I'm assuming there's probably a combination of practical and CGI. I didn't really see any of it that took me out of the film. The use of shadows was something that I really liked and the looks of some of the ghosts were as well. There are a lot of good cuts though that really helps to build that up if I'm honest. The film was shot very well also.Now with that said, I'm glad that I finally got around to checking this film out. It has an interesting premise of a man discovering the series of grisly crimes that have been committed in his house. It makes you wonder that if he is the one that actually is the killer or is something supernatural here. Or if he did it, are the ghosts partially to blame as well? I do think that it is paced in a way where the mystery does build, but it does kind of lose its way. The acting it thought was fine throughout, I had no issues there. The effects were pretty solid and the soundtrack doesn't necessarily stand out, but it is one that fit for what was needed. I don't think this is a great by any stretch, I thought it was above average and worth a viewing in my opinion."
" Absolutely Excellent!
",0.6468,0.9845,2019-08-29 00:00:00,10,"There's nothing more to be said! Excellent depiction of grief, psychological disturbance, and the effects of a guilty conscience.From the beginning, you think you know what happened; it makes it pretty clear. However, towards the end, a little doubt is thrown in; what if it IS ghosts that are doing this to him? By the very end, it's clear what truly happened, but also leaves a bit of uneasiness about the supernatural aspects.I thought the use of color in this was amazing as well! At first, I wasn't sure if they were using it, but by the end, it's pretty clear that whenever something terrible is happening with David - whether supernatural or otherwise - he falls into a bright red light while others are in normal, everyday light. A great contrast!It leaves on an interesting note, forcing the audience to wonder if the little boy had a psychological break of his own...or if he too was haunted. (Though, why did the grandmother not do the childproof lock on his door? Perhaps absent-mindedness in the light of everything else..)This was a very, very good supernatural and psychological suspense thriller that dives deep into the darker side of love and guilt."
" Visually Horrifying
",-0.5719,-0.7951,2019-06-16 00:00:00,9,"I've seen it all in the way of visually horrifying films, and though this one may not be a HEREDITARY, it is certainly frightening and very much a Ghost Story in the classic sense of the appellation."
" The title tells you where to throw this
",0.0,0.5487,2019-06-13 00:00:00,3,"Irritating little mystery chiller that cannot be taken seriously after it has the ghost stand around in halloween makeup.It is more excruciating than anything as the main character loses more and more respect from the people he knows in his slow descend into obsession but I care neither about him nor what he's looking for enough to be affected by it the they want me to be.Trashy stuff but I admit I liked its last few moments. Not worth the wait though, not by a long shot."
" WHO WANTS TO SEE GHOSTS?
",0.0,-0.9493,2019-06-11 00:00:00,6,"David (Rupert Evans) works at the archives. He has recently moved into a new home with his family. Six second David is not keeping his wife happy. At work, he comes across some old 1902 footage showing that a murder took place in his house, a man killed his cheating wife. He becomes obsessed with killings and the nearby canal, seeing ghosts in every film of the house.The film starts out a bit slow, and I suspected it was going to be a dud. However, it builds up and the ending made the slower parts worth while to stick it through. Good ghost story.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity...a little of each."
" Who killed the wife?
",-0.6705,-0.3818,2019-06-03 00:00:00,6,It's a good movie. It's scary in parts. It keeps you in hooks wondering if it's the ghost or the protagonist. The end is something you won't expect .This movie deserves a one time watch.
" Haunted or Insane?
",-0.7003,-0.9712,2019-01-04 00:00:00,6,"The family man David (Rupert Evans) and his pregnant wife Alice (Hannah Hoekstra) buy an old house nearby a canal to raise a family of their own. Five years later, their son Billy is the pride and joy of the family. David works archiving and editing films for his partner and friend Claire (Antonia Campbell-Hughes). When she gives a reel of a 1902 footage to work, David learns that his house was the place of a violent murder. This discover haunts David that sees a stranger inside his house threatening his son. When he finds that Alice is cheating on him with her client Alex (Carl Shaaban), David sees the stranger killing Alice and becomes obsessed to find who the suspect might be. Meanwhile he becomes the prime suspect of the police with his disturbed attitudes.""The Canal"" is an ambiguous horror movie with the story of a man that has a breakdown after learning that his home was the place of a brutal murder in 1902 and that his beloved wife is cheating on him. The story of haunting, obsession and madness has a confused screenplay and slow pace. But the acting and the dark cinematography make worthwhile watching this movie with low expectation and have a surprise. The creepy conclusion is the ambiguity of the story. Was David really insane? My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Canal"" (""The Canal"")"
" Iv'e seen better from Asia and the Far East.
",0.4404,0.1548,2018-11-15 00:00:00,5,"An Irish ghost thriller, that is more moody than scary and more downbeat than entertaining. I've seen so many of this ilk, that they all start to pale into just one memory. Just enough here to keep one watching and be mildly interested in the outcome. Korea, Japan and Thailand make this genre of film way, way better."
" Could be worse
",-0.4767,0.7554,2018-08-03 00:00:00,4,"This movie was well-made, and the acting was technically good, but I had a hard time connecting to the male lead. I didn't care enough about his character to be riveted to his story. I liked the creepy macabre flashes throughout, and the storyline had promise, but I found myself a little bored and watching the clock for most of the movie. However, in the league of indie horror movies, this one was better than a lot of them, and I can see why it got so many positive reviews."
" Excellent!
",0.6114,0.9413,2018-07-01 00:00:00,7,"Subtle, yet ever-so-effective, I had gooseflesh for most of the movie! Wow, this was so good. Wonderful acting, especially from lead Rupert Evans. Interesting twist ending!"
" Trapped to the point of nothingness
",-0.5267,-0.6204,2018-03-27 00:00:00,5,"I found ""The Canal"" to be quite comedic in its crafting, having laughed several times while trying to take it seriously, not because it wasn't scary, but at the production value itself.I admire Rupert Evans as an actor, but he couldn't save his fellow cast members from doing what probably they shouldn't have been doing in the first place, starting of with the kid's strange accent and ending with the teen nanny's unrealistic acting.Apart from that, I felt that the film editing was awful, with cuts and scene transitions that were completely random, furthermore the sound edition was not the best either.
The writing didn't help the movie, although some scenes were written to be at most engaging, noting the hole in the wall scenes in particular.This movie isn't one of those ""it's so bad it's good"" and neither a decent horror film, I wouldn't recommended even for a mock night with friends."
" Are you kidding me? Spoilers ahead, you're welcome for them.
",0.5267,0.4632,2018-02-11 00:00:00,2,"Let me save you a lot of time. The cop tells the husband ""You know why everyone always suspects it's the husband? Because it's always the husband."" Guess what? It's the husband. And you know it's the husband. Not for a second does any of the slightly supernatural nonsense make sense. Nor is his psychosis really explained. He killed his wife...but the ghost of his wife kills him? So we have supernatural/not supernatural....and then, the dad is suddenly some evil dude living in the wall who orders his five year old son to kill himself so they can all be together? YOU DON'T KILL OFF A SMALL KID IN THE FINAL 60 SECONDS JUST BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE IT. Oh, and just to make it more ambiguous, apparently, the woman ""sees"" the ghost son in the house at the end. I could barely get through this movie, but I thought, huh, really decent reviews, it's got to be worth this crippling slow repetitive garbage. The only reason I'm giving this a two is because the child was such a great actor."
