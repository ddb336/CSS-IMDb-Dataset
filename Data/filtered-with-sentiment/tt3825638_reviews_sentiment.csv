" between silence and lies
",-0.4215,0.9882,2021-03-18 00:00:00,7,"'Im Labyrinth der Schweigens', the original German title of the 2014 film directed by Giulio Ricciarelli, has been translated into English as 'Labyrinth of Lies'. This translation is, as the Italian saying goes, a betrayal. 'In the labyrinth of silence' would not only be more semantically exact, but would more accurately convey the theme and message of this excellent docu-drama. The story takes place in the late 1950s in the Federal Republic of Germany, a country experiencing a miracle of economic development and an apparent return to democracy and civilisation. The price of this social peace is a collective amnesia in which the crimes and horrors committed only 15-17 years before are buried in silence by those who had committed them and unknown to the young. The survivors, few and traumatised, were still silent. But building a new and healthy Germany meant getting out of this labyrinth of silence.
The film is inspired by a real case, which went to trial in Germany in the early 1960s and was investigated and prepared at about the same time as the trial of Adolf Eichman, captured in Argentina and brought to justice in Israel. The main hero is a young prosecutor named Johann Radmann, a fictional hero who represents a synthesis of several characters and a representative of a generation educated and raised immediately after the war, ignoring the very recent past of Germany but especially the role played by the parents' generation, many of whom were guilty of murder or complicity in silence. A true life character also appears in the film, Fritz Bauer, a public prosecutor who played an important role in ensuring that society and the justice system in the post-war Federal Republic of Germany failed to simply suppress the history of the Holocaust and the camps. As the investigation progresses, Johann Radmann goes through a process of political maturation and confrontation not only with the past but also with those around him - friends, family, the woman he falls in love with. The strongest scenes of the film are those in which investigators face the ignorance and in many cases the resistance of those who had built the 'labyrinth of silence' and at the same time are confronted with the direct, shocking testimonies of witnesses and survivors. The Italian-born film director Giulio Ricciarelli was inspired to renounce to words in the key moments, leaving the actors to transmit through the expressions of their faces the pain and traumas related to their revelations.
'Im Labyrinth der Schweigens' works quite well as a docu-drama and manages to recreate the atmosphere of post-war Germany prior to the admission of the crimes committed by the Nazis. Alexander Fehling, the actor who played in the key role of the young prosecutor, creates an interesting role, combining shyness and rigidity, an ignorance that seems almost incredible today with an idealism that ultimately overcomes doubts and personal crisis. From the rest of the cast, who do their job professionally, I would also mention Hansi Jochmann as the secretary of the prosecutor. Some of the side stories are less interesting, but in general the message of the film passes the screen effectively, the narrative is constantly and well paced, most of the dialogues are credible, and the public's interest is constantly kept awake. The end coincides with the beginning of the trial of the war criminals and their accomplices, a judicial process that was the first confrontation of the German legal system with the crimes committed by their compatriots during the Nazi period, but also an important milestone in the critical re-evaluation of the past by the whole German society, destroying the labyrinth of silence and lies. Even if 'Im Labyrinth der Schweigens' is not the ultimate German film dedicated to this theme, it is a good quality docu-drama, capturing precisely a significant moment in the history of 20th century Germany."

",0.0,-0.7621,2021-02-01 00:00:00,5,Decent acting. Poor directing. Terrible editing. Cute lead. Not bad but not very good either. It's rather boring I'd say.
" The important quest for truth
",0.4767,0.9881,2020-05-10 00:00:00,10,"At one moment Johann finds himself at a crossroad and has a brilliant future in store for him on a new job of less moral strain, but he chooses to go back to the difficult path of hardship up among the thorns, and his chief, Generalstaatsanwalt Fritz Bauer, commendably played by Gert Voss, the most important character in the context, somewhat reminding of Bruno Ganz, asks him: ""Why did you come back?"" The young prosecutor answers: ""We must do what is right."" And that is the main theme of the whole story. A Jewish painter recognizes a crook from Auschwitz as now a respectable school-teacher, and his young friend Johann together with his best friend the journalist Gnielka (André Szymanski) start digging. The deeper they dig, the more it stinks, as is usually the case, and of course this leads to some inconveniences, but they are never quite deterrent, as Generalstaatsanwalt Fritz Bauer actually urges them on, whereas you would have expected the opoosite from such an important man in a leading position; but there are other problems also - the most formidable one is that they are compelled to bring quite ordinary people to justice, a baker, farmers, lumberjacks and quite common citizens, and this is the extraordinary and most sensitive predicament of the process: what they find themselves obliged to do is to bring the entire German people on trial for having kept silent over atrocious crimes they were all too well familiar with, as none could turn a blind eye to them when Germany burned to cinders in the Second World War. It was not all just Hitler's fault, but everyone who watched it all without protest or saying anything were accomplices. It is not a question of guilt, it is a matter of facing the truth. As another said: The most important thing is not to bring all those guilty scoundrels to justice, but to let their victims come out with the truth by letting them tell their stories.
It's all a true story, the film begins in 1958. the trial starts in 1963. 17 out of 19 accused were sentenced after almost two years' trial, and it was the beginning of Germany's heroic effort to finally make a clean slate out of its most difficult chapter in history."

" Fritz Bauer had the More Interesting Story!
",0.5081,0.9816,2020-01-09 00:00:00,6,"Labyrinth of Lies is a fictionalised take on the 5 year planning and lead-up to the 1963 - 65 Frankfurt Auschwitz trials where 22 defendants were charged under West German criminal law for their roles in the Holocaust as mid- to lower-level officials in the Auschwitz-Birkenau death and concentration camp complex. The crux of the tale ruminates over the roadblocks and travails faced by the small investigating prosecution team, as they attempt to build cases against suspects, who appear to be treated far too sympathetically, if not protected by the German establishment and bureaucracy, still apathetic about the role and actions of the Nazi Party during World War 2.It is a handsome looking period piece with good production values and a fine central performance by Alexander Fehling playing the obviously fictional chief investigator Johann Radmann, who is appointed by the (real life) attorney - general Fritz Bauer. But unfortunately co-writer/director Giulio Ricciarelli doesn't really nail down a balanced and consistent storyline.We are delivered a 2 hour+ film overloaded and weighed down with the challenges faced by the prosecutors. I for one had really got the message about the over-indulgent Nazi sentiment permeating the West German pre-1960's establishment before the first hour was up. I didn't really need to cop another hour of the same sort of stuff. Those hoping for a courtroom drama climax pay-off will be sorely disappointed, as the closing courtroom doors of the beginning trial ring in the final credits.On top of this, despite the acknowledged good performance of Fehling, the weakest part of the narrative is the fictionalisation of the lead characters. Radmann is burdened with a rather insignificant on again, off again relationship with a fashion designer, during which he very predictably hits the bottle more than once, in the best Paul Newman Verdict tradition.The storyline never really flows and is far too episodic in its nature. This is best illustrated in the opening where important supporting character Simon, is shocked to recognise that Schultz, a former Auschwitz tormentor, is a teacher at the local school. He wants him arrested, but then for the rest of the movie never fully cooperates with Radmann's team for vague reasons, that aren't made abundantly clear. Another strange occurrence occurs later in the film where Radmann, is openly hostile to his suddenly introduced visiting mother, as soon as she walks through the door of his office. it's a very odd sequence, that just seems out of place editing wise.I think Ricciarelli would have been far better off, concentrating the story on the real life Fritz Bauer. In the movie he is an enigmatic supporting character, playing Radmann's boss and mentor. The movie seems happy to leave us wondering why he and he alone seems to be prepared to continually back Radmann and his team in the face of overwhelming opposition. Bauer's real story though, only hinted at in the the movie, is far more interesting than the invented fictional characters. Historically for instance, he, a German Jew, is given the credit for bringing the trials to life and bringing about permanent changes to the West German judicial system.One can see how with noble intentions Labyrinth of Lies was offered up for consideration for a Best Foreign Language Academy Award nomination. But at the same time I can understand how it didn't rate a mention, as ultimately, it just doesn't nearly deliver the overall quality goods that a potential Oscar winner should."

" An outstanding film
",0.6124,0.974,2019-08-24 00:00:00,9,"I stumbled on this film on TV by accident and was blown away. it's the heroic journey of a young lawyer, Johann Radmann, who in 1960s Germany tries to bring perpetrators of Nazi war crimes to justice. But's like wading through a toxic swamp, with everyone he meets either somehow involved in war crimes, or protecting friends, or just wanting to forget it all happened. The sets and tone are remarkably restrained but it's the script that shines. It's crisp and clear - like Johann, it conveys complex ideas and information in an easy to understand way. As Radmann, actor Alexander Fehling is excellent - he has just enough stubborn persistence to continue, despite diabolical hurdles. Sometimes it seems as though no one else cares. But there are powerful scenes when he arrests people who murdered prisoners at Auschwitz. It's hard to believes how monsters such as Auschwitz doctor Josef Mengele was effectively allowed to escape justice, thanks to powerful friends. The film points out that even everyday people were guilty of crimes small and large. Johann's despair and sense of grief is bottomless. I guess that's the point of the film.
He's kind of Germany's conscience. In the end he really can't do much. But unlike most others, he cares about justice and the truth."
" Very Good historic movie
",0.4927,0.874,2019-02-08 00:00:00,8,One of the Best Movie I've seen on WWII Holocaust (with Les Faussaires). Great investigation on What we should never forget.
" compelling history needs more drama
",0.2263,0.4378,2017-04-02 00:00:00,7,"It's 1958 Frankfurt, West Germany. Johann Radmann is a young by-the-books prosecutor toiling in traffic court and believing his father to be anti-Nazi. Reporter Thomas Gnielka brings the case of Charles Schulz, a teacher suspected of being a Nazi guard in Auschwitz. Nobody cares about what happened there and actively ignores the collective Nazi past. He starts a relationship with Marlene Wondrak. Gnielka introduces him to camp survivor Simon Kirsch. Radmann starts digging into the past and building a case against many. His main obsession is camp doctor Josef Mengele who experimented on the prisoners.The history is very compelling. However, the story lacks danger or intensity. It needs some additional drama. There is some professional and personal drama but none of it is that intense. The production and acting is first rate. It is a very compelling watch although there are no big surprises."
" Sometimes We Need to Look Within Ourselves
",0.0,-0.6419,2017-02-13 00:00:00,8,"In 1958, the German people had very little knowledge of the death camps of World War II. A Jew, whose children were experimented upon, demands to be heard but is ignored by the legal system. A young lawyer hears his pleas but doesn't know what he can do. When he proposes action, he is ignored or scolded by those that would be of the most help. He finds a small group of people that are working on the cases in the camps. He wants the big fish, Joseph Mengele, and forgets about those who were in the SS or who acted like savages in the camps. This is about a man who is so driven that he can't come to grips with the idea that most of the country were Nazis, including those close to him. He get very emotional in his all-or-nothing quest and alienates people. He even dismisses the children of Nazis, even if they had nothing to do with anything. He is angry with all of Germany but doesn't ask why this all happened. This is a film about seeing what is most important in our lives--what can be changed and what can't. The ultimate trial proved to be one of the most important in modern history."
