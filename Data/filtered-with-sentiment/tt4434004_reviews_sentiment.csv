" Echoes of chaos from Punjab
",-0.5719,0.9961,2021-03-30 00:00:00,7,"Abhishek Chaubey makes a winning change with Udta Punjab, a film about the rampant drug menace in the state of Punjab. Chaubey's portrayal of this region is horrifying, to say the least, presenting a world of terrible destruction and filth which is almost dystopian. Udta Punjab is an unusual film in this regard, it is real and authentic in execution, with lifelike dialogue which includes profanity hardly seen in mainstream Hindi films, and similarly lifelike sets. The film gets very disturbing at points, but at the same time the direction is good enough and balances the negativity.The casting presents excellent performances, balancing between two pairs of actors, the first two fighting the drug system and the other two being its victims. While the film's two main leads, the hardly recognisable Shahid Kapoor and Alia Bhatt, are the central players here, they are actually more of character actors in this setting, and their stories are presented against the larger backdrop, where Diljit Dosanjh and Kareena Kapoor loosen the intensity with their positive characters who are in many ways the heroes of the film. It is actually a wonderful writing decision.Shahid Kapoor is like one has never seen. His mannerisms and expressions and his entire attention to detail are really impressive. He does get a little too wide-eyed in his hysterical outbursts, but it's effective within the film's context, and his is a fantastic, convincing turn. It is Alia Bhatt, however, who dominates this film in a much smaller role which digs deep into the human soul. Aside from her mastery of the Bihari accent, she plays the film's most difficult scenes with unsettling, harrowing intensity. And her character remains incredibly optimistic all though. It is a heartbreaking performance.Dosanjh is a great new find as Sartraj, and he is very convincing as the tough, no-nonsense but kindly levelheaded cop whose moral values are always intact. He has great presence, and his seemingly unlikely chemistry with Kareena is wonderfully built and developed throughout the story. Indeed, these two are responsible for the lighter part of the film, and the bonding their common, novel mission brings about is very touching. Credit should also go to Kareena, the lady star foregoing vanity to play a most regular character with minimal importance and doing it gracefully.Udta Punjab will surely be accused of a biased, overly negative presentation of the state of Punjab, and not without a reason actually. Those unfamiliar with India might find themselves scared to visit this area of India. While Chaubey mitigates the film's horrors with nice music and other redeeming qualities, he does not do the same with the image of Punjab. At the end of it all, the film is still very watchable, mainly for the performances and the brutally honest portrayal of the destruction of drugs. In this regard, it is interesting and engaging even if not necessarily a fun watch."
" Awesome!!!
",0.7163,0.897,2021-01-26 00:00:00,9,The entire cast did a brilliant job!!! The scenes are really gripping and the music is also good. The only thing I didn't like is the length of the film. Hats off to abhishek chaubey for directing such a great movie!!!
" Dubta punjab
",0.0,0.2732,2021-01-16 00:00:00,5,The ending was rubbish and shahid's acting was annoying. Alia's performance was amazing.
" Convenient Bollywood
",0.0,0.34,2020-09-19 00:00:00,1,"Drugs is rampant in the film industry itself , why only highlight Punjab ?"
" Should improve some things
",0.4404,0.296,2020-08-17 00:00:00,6,"The plot is good, the characters are well developed, there are some good twists and turns. The message is crystal clear, to show how the drug destroys young lives, and how the business is carried out in Punjab, India where poverty is rampant. However the fast simple contrived events dropped time and again, and on top of that the childish ending tarnishes the quality shown in this long movie"
" Total waste of money
",-0.4215,-0.0772,2020-08-17 00:00:00,1,"I was in theater to watch after half I felt like
Gayi bhaise paani maie
Total waste of money"
" AMAZING!!
",0.658,0.49,2020-07-23 00:00:00,10,"WHAT A MOVIE! EVERYTHING IS SO GOOD.. CONCEPT, SCREENPLAY, DIRECTION AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ACTING.. SHAHID KAPOOR, ALIA BHATT, DILJIT DOSANJH AND KAREENA KAPOOR KHAN NAILED IT!"
" Excellent film
",0.5719,0.9678,2020-07-04 00:00:00,10,Read the plot before watching this film. Excellent one coupled with good performance by Shahid Kapoor playing the role of a drug addicted rapper and Alia Bhatt playing the role of a migrant worker. Also great performances by Diljit playing the role of a cop and Kareena Kapoor playing the role of a doctor. This movie mainly spreads awareness about the cross-border exchange of drugs near the Punjab border thereby rendering many Punjabi youths addicted to drug. The clean up operation of the Punjab police force assisted by the Doctor who spreads awareness to the Punjab farmers about the ill-effects of drugs forms the climax of this movie. Enjoyed it thoroughly and give it a ten out of ten.
" Superb acting from everyone plus social message
",0.6249,0.5719,2020-05-15 00:00:00,9,"I can watch that movie again , story line , acting, subject everything perfect"
" Splendid Acting, Splendid Direction
",0.8225,0.7743,2020-05-06 00:00:00,9,"Way Of Storytelling Was Good. Shahid Kapoor,Alia Bhaat, Kareena Kapoor Just Nailed It In Acting. Direction was top notch. Pictured A Harsh But True Scenario Of Punjab. Highly Recommended."
" Violence at its peak!
",-0.6588,-0.8838,2020-03-16 00:00:00,5,"The storyline is good (not that much too), but what a violence! Violence at its peak... This is not how you can give a social message. And it's probably because of this grim that I was skipping this motion picture for all those years & only watched it in 2020.... But I had to make a review. So watched it finally.
If your story is strong, you should go a level higher. Give thriller scenes, but don't show that terrible amount of violence!
The 1st part was damn good and a 7 out of 10 from me for that, 2nd part was really shrill, I'll rate a 3 out of 10, and that too for the awesome acting of Alia Bhatt (especially), Shahid and Diljit.I must end by saying that Alia Bhatt was the one and only dominant actress. Everyone else's were simply miles away."
" Didn't like the ending
",-0.2755,0.8223,2020-02-25 00:00:00,6,"The whole movie was very good to see, but the ending of the movie made this an ""above average"" to me.
Shahid Kapoor and Alia Bhatt were both outstanding."
" Wow...Just wow !!!
",0.6884,0.734,2019-11-21 00:00:00,9,"What a movie! Shahid and Alia did a great job in acting. Well written, well directed. Haven't seen a better Bollywood film in a long long time than Udta Punjab."
" One of the best Indian movie in recent times
",0.6369,0.0,2019-11-10 00:00:00,9,History will remember this movie as a classic. It's undoubtedly one of the finest offering from Indian cinema.
" Bitter Reality
",-0.4215,0.34,2019-07-12 00:00:00,9,"There was all just bitter truth in the movie.
Everything that happened to the Character of Alia Bhatt in the movie happens to thousands of Women in India.
A good movie for one's awareness"
" I didnt liked the film
",-0.3252,0.8538,2019-06-21 00:00:00,3,"Though I liked the cause that they took over,the whole plot relates to the strong indulgence of pujnjabs youth in intoxication wgich is friefly hampering their life,it is a serious problem of the state and we should take our time to ponder about and fix it,it shows some responsibility which I respect,but as a viewer i was not overwhelmed by the story line,it was not realistic,why Bollywood can't relate to reality,a thing not been accessed over the pastWhy the hero became a drug addict should had been given priority over how he saved his girlfriend from escalation by some goons,,If u dont have time,dont watch"
" Brofist for you
",0.0,0.8481,2019-05-29 00:00:00,10,"Awesome both regarding acting and entertainment
Goid story
See once for sure"
" Bollywood needs more of such movies
",0.0,-0.1386,2019-04-11 00:00:00,8,"An impressive Bollywood flick! While the movie doesn't have any statistical or direct information about the drug syndicate in Punjab, the efforts of the producer, director and the screenplay writer to bring such a perilous affair on the Indian soil to the mainstream cinema are commendable(I guess 'Dum Maaro Dum' was the only movie in recent years to have brushed this topic). The first half is engaging as the different characters and their stories emerge but sloppy and predictable in the second, especially, the temptation to converge the stories should have been resisted. Alia Bhatt's makeup and her acting stands out when compared to the rest of the cast. Amit Trivedi's compositions are commendable, specifically, 'Hass Nach Ley'. Bollywood should focus on ameliorating such movies by adding facts, avoiding melodrama and 'masala' altogether"
" Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9365,2019-04-09 00:00:00,9,"Really a masterpiece! The acting of Shahid and Alia, gave the movie a new height. The scene where Alia talks about never be broken is the one of the highlight moment of the movie. I do not wonder why the movie has received such huge praises"
" Just Beautiful!
",0.636,0.8225,2019-02-16 00:00:00,10,"One of the finest films of the decade. A mustwatch for everyone. Amazing screenplay, direction and all the four leads have done an amazing job."
" Violent , Disturbing, good performances but slow pace
",-0.3919,0.4779,2019-02-08 00:00:00,7,"Overall this movie is good. Some great performances. Full of violence and lots of scenes of disturbance, some close to reality of drugs. Very unfortunate to see such extent of drugs in society. At times it's very slow. Same message can be given in much shorter film. Loads of twists and turns in the story. There are a few scenes which are much beyond reality for example when They are searching in factory and even join the workers. Worth watching once, sure will leave impression for a while"
" Entertainment + social message
",0.4215,0.3197,2019-01-26 00:00:00,9,"First of all, great acting by all the lead actors. Movie is made crafty. Shows the distress of drug addicted population. The effect it has on the family, the society and the state as a whole. Really scary if you put yourself in their shoes. A very necessary social message. Great work. A must watch one."
" Tommy Singh !!!!!!!
",0.0,0.9636,2018-10-05 00:00:00,7,"Story is brilliant , very well executed !! Shahid Kapoor plays his role nearly to perfection!! Alia Bhatt is outstanding as usual , rest all of them are good !"
" It's more than just a movie
",0.0,0.8176,2018-07-27 00:00:00,8,"I have to say as being a social activist, the scenario of the movies is happening in the south east Asain countries like India. The acting and the ending of the movie was good. If you think deeply then you will find some of the sarcasm bad ass."
" Best Bollywood movie I have ever seen
",0.6369,0.9491,2018-07-12 00:00:00,10,Superb plot and amazing acting by all actors!!!! Sad reality of Punjab portrayed in a beautiful way. Must recommended for everyone interested in meaningful cinema.
" One of the best In a long time
",0.6369,0.2263,2018-03-17 00:00:00,10,This movie is worth watching for the class acting by Alia/Shahid/Diljit and Kareena... A movie depicting reality and niche direction
" One Word, Brilliant .!
",0.6239,0.9628,2017-11-15 00:00:00,9,"I have so much to say about this movie, the movie is not just about drugs it's pack with multiple brilliant things and star-cast grips the story until the end , every actor , side actor is best chosen for their role and director abhishek dubey does wonderful job directing movie we see both worlds in movie one where drugs are celebrated with reverse monk mindset we see drugs as awesome thing in youth in parties and the harsh reality of local drug crisis in rural part we see cops benefiting from drugs and enjoy media attention we also see a lady doctor and socialist to stop this vicious drug market , the first half focus on coolness of drugs the booze , party , drugs , slang overall the rich part of society , then we get hit hard with reality when hangover gets started and over the reality is also very well portrayed , i have to praise the performance of both aaliya bhatt and shahid kapoor they shine as in their role , diljit doshni and kareena kapor also brings charm to their performance , Bottom line : The Movie is based on reality that's still happening in Punjab the movie focuses on both world the rich of Punjab and poor of Punjab how this reality is affecting Punjab the movie is pack with gruesome reality but in entertaining glasses , Definitely watch it , even after 94 cuts the movie shines ."
" Relevant topic, great message and brilliant performances!
",0.8478,0.9702,2017-09-29 00:00:00,10,"Have specifically created an account to write a review for this which easily qualifies to be one of my most favorite movies of all times.Not only did the main leads deliver on performance, but the supporting actors deserve an applause as well. Here is to hoping that we see more movies like Udta Punjab.And- DRUGS DI MAA DI!! of course."
" Good movie that highlights the problem of drugs in Punjab.
",0.0516,0.3182,2017-09-07 00:00:00,9,"The movie is scripted on the basis of drug problem going in Punjab. It bursts one of the rackets going on because of drugs. It is crafted exceptionally well.The movie portrays how the problem gives rise to two of the wars, one between system and corrupt officials and other between relatives and members who are on drugs.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: It is captured well.Tone: Drug addiction is the tone which is captured well. It is shown what happens when one is on drugs and when one leaves it or made to leave.Music: Music is above average. It is portrayed how one of the singers needs to get high to be functional. It is also described how he gets over that habit finds something else as inspirational source to sing.Acting: Shahid has acted exceptionally well. Others were good too.It is worth watching."
" Poetic !!
",0.0,-0.8335,2017-09-02 00:00:00,8,"A movie on the drug menace in Punjab could easily have been a fine subject for an art film or a documentary.But Chaubey who directed and also co written the film gives us a poem in return. The movie is poetic from the word go. The story of 4 different characters is beautifully blended with the drug problem in the state. It captures how each one is caught in this mess and all are fighting the menace in their own way. It also shows that together they can fight it better and to the mess, add a bit of romance and some soulful music with beautiful lyrics to lighten up the mood when needed. Ek Kudi is a standout trackI don't want to reveal much of the story because I believe that one should watch the film. It doesn't become preachy at any point and the ending is shocking yet beautiful. Also, it never goes over top and it clearly tells that there is no easy and fast end to this problem.Punjab which is normally shown as a land of beautiful lush fields and greens is shown here a dark land with the greens shown as a beautiful cover up for the drug mafia. After Maachis, Udta Punjab shows the contrasting picture of the state and no wonder the film ran into so much controversy.The performances is another highlight of this film. Alia Bhatt is a revelation. She has very few dialogues but she compensates that with her body language and eyes. No wonder she swept all the acting awards and declares once again that she is the next superstar in making. The greed, fear, frustration, the loss and finally the will to fight is classic. Her dialogue delivery with a bihari accent was a little disappointing but he acting will leave you speechless.Matching with her is Shahid Kapoor. As Tommy Singh, the volatile and eccentric rock star, Kapoor is equally mind blowing. He like Bhatt takes on a transformation and initially we hate him but as the film progresses, we start to pity and hope he improves.He owns Tommy SIngh . There is one beautiful scene between Bhatt and Kapoor is poetic. Both are criticising themselves to each other...One in Punjabi and the other in Bhojpuri and that seen made laugh but also feel sad for both of them.Dosanjh is an actor to watch out for. He is terrific as the corrupt cop who is blind to the drug problem but is ready to fight the system and himself to save his kid brother from drugs. Supporting him is Kareena Kapoor, the doctor and the only one who is right between all the wrong people. She is a fighter and ready to go to any extent to fight the problem. Kareena is a fine actress and again proves it here. Even in the small role and like Bhatt de-glamoured, she is shows her mettle.The rest of the supporting star cast which include Satish Kaushik are excellent and make this film a must watch.The movie is depressing and disturbing but I would suggest you to watch it once for the 4 leads and music."
" Intense and real
",0.0772,0.6478,2017-07-24 00:00:00,10,"It's a very well made movie, with excellent performances by each actor, and an emotional intensity that keeps you both tethered to the movie, and on the edge.The portrayal of many different aspects of society right from the power drunk gabru Shahid, to the small timer from Bihar Alia bhatt, each come with an authenticity of their culture.Wish there were more such movies."
" didn't understand anything
",0.0,0.7793,2017-05-17 00:00:00,1,still wondering what was the movie all about... acting was good but didn't understood a single sentence in the whole movie... all are saying it's about reality but in no case this can be reality... every situation in this movie is utter rubbish... only thing good in this movie can be humour of shahid in the police station.. else everything in utter rubbish...
" It is THE most WonderFul Movie.
",0.6115,0.9845,2017-04-07 00:00:00,10,"I have watched hundred of top Oscar winning movies but I haven't written a review.But this movie compelled me to write it.Please watch it and the acting of Alia Bhatt is par extraordinary and genuine.Shahid Kapoor's acting is also good but Alia Bhatt has won the show.Her acting looks so original and convincing that the movie becomes awesome. So, please must watch it.Thanks."
" A powerful film which deals with a global issue
",0.4215,0.9929,2017-01-26 00:00:00,10,"Udta Punjab is a bold movie.It speaks out on an issue that's widespread and needs addressing.The story-line is very beautifully created and the journeys of the 4 characters-played by Shahid,Alia,Diljit and Kareena make for a very entertaining film. All 4 characters play their parts very well.Shahid pumps a lot of energy in his character of a pop- star addicted to drugs.Diljit as a cop gives an honest and real performance.He brings freshness to the movie and his chemistry with Kareena is joyful.Kareena is graceful in her portrayal of a doctor who treats patients of drug abuse.The real star of the movie though is Alia,who delivers a splendid performance and keeps the audience involved in her struggle.It is a different role compared to her previous films and she absolutely nails it.Her powerful acting takes the movie to another level and one is just left wondering what's in store next for this great actress.The director,writers,producers all have done a great job in making such a bold movie.Surely,one of the best movies of Bollywood."
" Loud, expletive filled but entertaining
",0.5927,0.9774,2017-01-17 00:00:00,8,"This is a watchable movie, expletive filled and rustic as the characters demand. Movie takes some time to build but gathers pace as it goes on. The end was a bit underwhelming for me. Shahid Kapoor is brilliant as Tommy Singh. What a performance. Alia Bhatt overacts her way through the role while Daljit and Kareena put in solid authentic performances. Having seen Kareena in a number of movies - you can see how she has matured as an actor with subtle touches which were missing in her earlier days. Hopefully she continues to take meaningful roles to keep growing as an actor. The music is brilliant with great use of rap and multiple electronic sounds blended with Punjabi"
