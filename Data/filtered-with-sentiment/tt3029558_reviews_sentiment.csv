" Very good sequel, a slight downgrade though!
",0.54,0.9987,2021-02-03 00:00:00,8,"Plot:Kenshin Himura goes up against pure evil Makoto Shishio who is attempting to overthrow the Meiji government. The fate of the country hangs in the balance as Kenshin Himura takes up the sword that he vowed to never draw again.Analysis:After an impressive first movie, the expectations were really high for this one and to be fair it didn't disappoint at all, it might had a less thoughtful plot than the first one but it was still a really good and entertaining movie. Most things were kept in the same level as the first and it was a really nice surprise that they found an interesting way to involve the politic level of Kenshin's origin, that made this movie feel original and well-designed.Shishio is obviously a more threating villain, his plan has deeper motives and he has a personal connection with the story that helps the creator to build a meaningful plot. He is a big threat, he is skilled, he is vicious and there is a mystery around his character that intrigues the audience. The realtionship dynamics with his rival Kenshin are really tense, they are both masters of the art of war and Shishio looks a lot like a more evil version of Kenshin's past alter ego Batousai. There are interesting sub plots that were explored and as the first part of a 2-film story it does a decent job at exploring something new and leading our heroes to a very different adventure.In terms of visuals and production the movie is even better that the first one. The success of the previous film was massive, anime fans were totally satisfied and that created expectations. That's why the second one is even more ambitious, there are more and bigger fight scenes, even more difficult choreographies, more creative choices and more impressive images in general. It's so beautiful to watch, the colours, the camerawork, the fights, everything feels more personal and more entertaining which is the main goal of a samurai action movie, it's a blockbuster formula applied to Asian culture and that's a very attractive combination.Although it's a very good movie with innovative ideas and a very fresh story, it's a slight downgrade of the original and the main reason is that the plot feels a little less personal than the first. Rurouni Kenshin: Origins explored moral dilemma and personal growth in ways that most action movies couldn't and that gave it the abillity to be more memorable and more interesting for the audience. While Kyoto Inferno does a very good job at turning this franchise to a new direction and setting up the thrid part, it feels like a movie made only for entertainment purposes that doesn't explore the emotional depth behind the story enough, but chooses to create more big fights and badass moments rather than doing something that would hold back the fast pace but it would give more meaning to those events.Conclusion:It didn't reach the greatness of Origins but it did a very good job at creating something new, it was fun, well-made, good-looking and deserves more attention and more praise. These films are not famous enough in western countries and that's pretty unfair when they do many things way better that the hollywood ones of the same genre. It's a very nice sequel and although it doesn't reach the level of the previous movie, it's still very enjoyable.Rating: 8.5/10"
" Solid, but underwhelming
",0.0772,0.4391,2020-07-21 00:00:00,6,"It is easily the least of the trilogy. That being said, the opening is absolutely brilliant. It provides a level of suspense and a Hollywood level intro to our villain that is absent through the rest of the film. It feels rushed and never really settles into a groove."
" Long and disappointing
",-0.4939,0.5106,2020-06-03 00:00:00,6,"This film does not live up to the first one. Even though they are similar in length, this one feels a lot longer. As usual, there are good historical sets and actions, but I did not feel that this film was a compelling follow-up."
" One of the best,
",0.6369,0.9713,2019-12-23 00:00:00,9,"Without a doubt, one of the best action movies ever made. Stellar acting, great stuntwork and choreography, emotional stakes, and likable characters, it one of the greatest sequels ever made, and certainly one of the best movies ever."
" A Can-Be-Perfect Movie
",0.0,-0.8037,2019-12-20 00:00:00,7,"Overall: 7/10
As a movie and a part of the whole trilogy, this one is not bad.
Personally, I believe the first purpose of any artwork is to be an end of itself. In other words, it needs to be completed in terms of its storyline and its characters. In this movie, the main story is about how Kenshin will try to stop Shishio Makoto and how he fails to stop him, which will be continued in the following movie. If I just look at this movie from this point, the story is completed and it gives space for the last part of th trilogy, which is the end, to continue. So, overall, it's simple but it was done well.Action: 9/10
Very exciting.Music: 8/10
Suitable overall.The Characters Development: 6/10
Kenshin: As the protagonist, his struggled heart and his wish toward the true new era were well-shown.
However, not all of the characters are well developed. Some really had serious issues.
Yahiko: He wasn't introduced at all...I mean, really, after two movies, he still has nothing inside: there is no reason for him to be there. The only thing I can recall is that his full name is told and that was it.
Sanosuke: He is just a side-kick now. We have no idea about why he still lived in Kamiya Dojo and why he had to go to Kyoto to help Kenshin.
Aoshi: As most people have suggested, he can be moved. His role in this trilogy is to challenge Kenshin, which will happen in the next movie, but, what was the reason for him to be here, in the second part? He has nothing to do with the story.As an adaptation of the Manga/Anime: 5/10
Kenshin is still Kenshin.
But the others...
Sanosuke has a sad background actually. In the original work, he lived in darkness before he met Kenshin and Kenshin was the one who showed him the light and the way to live in the new era. He stayed with Kenshin because he knew how much he struggled and he wanted to help him. But in the movies, he was just there as a side-kick and that was it.
Aoshi in the Anime sided with Shishio and that was how he came to this part. But, why couldn't the movie just do the same?
Yahiko as a kid also has his own role, that was shown well in the original work. But not in the movie. In the movie, we just know his name.And, the part when Kenshin chose to leave Kaoru was actually a very depressing part. In the anime, before this part, a lot emotions were lied before it. All of details accumulated and together they made this part a depressing part while at the same served the main story. In the movie, this part simply became a scene to serve the big picture but the emotions were less told."
" Great Adaptation
",0.6249,0.9924,2019-06-24 00:00:00,10,"Awesome movie which remains true to the anime , but is absolutely convincing regardless. I was a bit skeptical myself, but the actors fit, the choreography is great and it remains exciting until the end - action with a lot of emotion. Only the beginning is a bit unclear and it takes 1-2 minutes to find your way around (at least I felt so). Anyone who knows the anime or manga will love the movie for its closeness to the source material. Those who do not know will still love it for its spiky action / fight scenes, great acting and nicely paced plot. Conclusion: very worth seeing. A film that you can definitely watch more often. 10/10 stars."

" What a great sequel
",0.6249,0.9636,2019-06-02 00:00:00,9,"I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this. I didn't expect it to be as good as the first movie but this was so good! I love the cast, the action and the way the director went with this. Such a good live-action movie!"
" Eternal habit of making Story.Zip
",0.0,0.1957,2018-09-01 00:00:00,7,"I never liked the doramas. Surprisingly, that one is good, and made qualitative. But the score, still, will be only 7. Because it does not matter how qualitatively the film is made, if it will never describes the story of whole long... LONG plot only with three films."
" Not just an ordinary action film
",0.0,0.0,2018-03-05 00:00:00,9,"The casting, the acting, the fight scenes are incredible. By far the best fight scenes I have seen in my existence. Apart from that there is a moral lesson to learn"
" Despite being the first of a two part sequel, it manages to be a self-sufficient, coherent story. Virtuosic.
",0.4939,0.9422,2017-09-08 00:00:00,10,"One of those rare sequels that only improves upon the promises of it's predecessor, a dynamic and sprawling adaptation of the franchises infamous Kyoto arc. THIS, and the previous film should be held in high regard, and be looked to as the gold standard of how to adapt a long running arc to film format. This film seriously trims all of the needless filler character fat from the source. What they changed turned out to be good for it. Incredible action direction once again coordinated by Kenji Tanigaki. The devotion from the actors here, as they all performed their own stunts and mastered their own choreography, is really a feat to behold. All in all, Kyoto Inferno is just as good as the first film, if not better. Despite being the first of a two part sequel, it manages to be a self-sufficient, coherent story. Virtuosic."
" Good enough
",0.4404,0.8115,2017-08-24 00:00:00,8,"The sequel of the first samurai movie has a lots of action but some unsolved plot twists. The main character, having finally found peace, he is summoned back into the world of killing in order to preserve that peace. Honestly, the girl who always gets disappointed over the non killing thing was annoying, but other than that, she wasn't in the film much. The action sword scenes were really good and the whole thing was once again a big production when it came to settings, costumes and special effects. The performances were good as well. But, my only concern was that everything seemed to just pave the way towards the third movie. So, 8 out of 10."
