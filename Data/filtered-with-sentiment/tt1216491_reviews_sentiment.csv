" Well done
",0.2732,0.3818,2021-04-04 00:00:00,8,This movie opens your eyes about what the American government is capable of. Still waiting for a Hollywood movies that tells the real story about 9/11 though.
" Excellent but sad
",-0.4215,0.9262,2021-03-27 00:00:00,9,"Excellent movie, a very engrossing true story about government corruption, the journalist who exposed it, and the price he paid for telling the truth. The actress who played the wife was extremely annoying, as was the eldest son. Other than that, EXCELLENT performances, particularly, of course, by the leading actor. It made me cry what happened to Gary, and how often good people get screwed in this sick and corrupt world. Even so, it was an outstanding movie and I highly recommend it. This was an important story that needed to be told."
" Terrific movie ......but
",0.4767,-0.6956,2021-01-21 00:00:00,9,"This is a terrific movie but I had trouble with the audio levels at times making it difficult to follow the dialogue, Did anyone else notice that?"
" Blah.
",-0.1027,-0.8754,2020-12-31 00:00:00,2,"Kill the Messenger is neither immersive or evoking.Random people here and there, with thin overview. Not well acted, with dull empty execution."
" Corruption goes all the way to the top.
",0.2023,0.9887,2020-12-29 00:00:00,9,"What does it say when the people responsible never actually go to jail? Never face the death sentence even though they sentence others to death? This movie points a big elephant-in-the-room finger at the corrupt organisation at the heart of this truly evil plot. And deservedly so. In real life one of the key characters actually ends up being assassinated by them - and his death ruled a suicide even though he was double-tapped to the forehead. At the end of the movie, your guess is probably is as good as mine: probably very little has changed in the years that have passed since the events portrayed. This film is well acted, very well directed and holds sway from beginning to end. It would score a perfect ten in my book if they had only managed a bit more tightened suspense, which a film of this magnitude and calibre was always capable of achieving. Renner is fantastic. And I for one am glad this story is told. Just because scumbags never faced justice does not mean they should enjoy retirement in complete obscurity and their deeds go untold. I agree with other reviews here - this is an important story. And I think you'll be glad you watched this movie should you give it the chance it certainly deserves. If you don't feel anything at the end of this movie; if it doesn't move you in some way, shape or form, you'd have to lack empathy. Much the same way this corrupt organisation has lacked respect for law and order, human lives, dignity, moral and professional standards and human decency, full stop."
" JEREMY RENNER IS FANTASTIC & PROVES HE'S ONE OF THE GREATEST ACTORS WORKING TODAY!!!
",0.865,0.9978,2020-11-08 00:00:00,7,"Jeremy Renner has truly become a real proper ""MOVIE STAR"" as he's dished out incredibly intense & thrilling performances & blew me away with his OUTSTANDING & Oscar worthy performance in the excellent Grim Murder Mystery Thriller WIND RIVER, a performance so well acted i consider it one of the best performances in Cinema history but that's in my opinion!!!
Here the incredible Renner gives yet another fantastic & real performance as in a true story part as a great Reporter for a paper who gets in too deep & uncovers things that will change everything including his own life & family. This is part political Thriller & part Autobiographical Drama & it's truly gripping!!!
Renner is Amazing here & by the end of the movie i felt for him so much & even shed some tears as Renner is so convincing portraying this hound dog of man that will stop at nothing for the truth of his story & everything else starts to fall apart around him.
Renner plays his role with realism & heart as he's a family man with his own flaws & messy past, he plays a real person here & the speech he delivers near the end is so heartfelt & emotional thanks to Renner.
Also the ensemble cast is excellent, so many great actors pop up throughout the movie for example BARRY PEPPER, ROBERT PATRICK & ANDY GARCIA to name just a few of the great performers that keep this gritty Conspiracy Thriller ticking along & interesting.
A good solid Thriller with an incredible lead performance by the great RENNER."
" Taut drama
",0.0,0.3638,2020-09-08 00:00:00,8,"Taut drama. Although seemingly one-dimensional, I disagree with those who have used this as a slur. It is a story based on GW's findings, his search for truth, and the impact he had on events, so surely being one-dimensional means the screenwriters and director haven't veered off course! There aren't many moments of palpable suspense, but the few there are, are enough to add a stomach-turning element to just how 'real' his story was"

" Renner Shines In Typical Hollywood Product
",0.0,0.631,2020-05-07 00:00:00,6,"You've seen plenty of movies like this if you're a film buff, so if the story seems different, yet familiar, you will know if this is worth your time. Renner''s performance is great, and it's a piece of history that is important to acknowledge, but the story is told in a pedestrian manner that hits all the key points without much flair or drama. 5 stars with an extra star for Renner."
" Fascinating story, crippled by a boring direction.
",0.296,0.2393,2020-04-17 00:00:00,6,"This story is wild and out of control, yet this movie about it is so tame and feel good and predictable and even a bit boring. I really think the director has missed an opportunity to make a great, suspenseful movie.I would rather watch any classic paranoia thriller from the seventies like ""All The President's Men"", "" The Parallax View"" or ""Three Days of the Condor"". Those movie are about government conspiracies as well, but those seventies classics are full on suspenseful and riveting from the beginning till the very end, while ""Kill The Messenger"" consists of a lot of husband and wife talks, which simply deflates any thrill.Conclusion: tedious execution of a fascinating story."
" ""My friend, some stories are just too true to tell.""
",0.7184,-0.9486,2020-02-03 00:00:00,7,"Here we have an object lesson on what it means to take on the government, and it's not pretty. Journalist Gary Webb (Jeremy Renner) accidentally discovers a major story about the CIA's involvement in aiding and abetting drug trafficking into the country, and while it becomes a major scoop for a relatively small, home town newspaper, it very quickly becomes a taboo subject when the CIA pressures major newspapers to go after Webb for using 'unreliable' sources. The backdrop is the Contra scandal of the 1980's, with the illicit money gained from the drug deals going toward the supply of arms and ammunition to the freedom fighting rebels of Nicaragua. It's one of those 'ends justifies the means' examples often cited to attain a worthwhile outcome using dubious, if not outright illegal and immoral methods. One can admire Webb's courage and integrity in pursuing the story, while questioning the very manner in which he put the lives of himself and his family in danger. For some, what remains an easy choice can often end in tragedy, as the real life Gary Webb resigned from his job and wound up a suicide victim seven years later. This is one of those films that almost forces you to consider what you would do under similar circumstances, with not many willing to stomach the harassment and lies that come with the territory."
" Stellar performance by Renner
",0.0,0.5507,2020-01-04 00:00:00,6,"Maybe not the best made movie from 2014, but it certainly is one of the most important movies from that year. Renner gives a stellar performance here as Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gary Webb."
" Companion piece to American Made
",0.0,-0.9877,2019-12-31 00:00:00,6,"It is heartening that there are people gutsy enough to make films such as Kill the Messenger and American Made, which relay extremely disturbing stories about how U.S. taxpayers´ funds are put to use by the Caustic Incompetence Agency (CIA), which frankly needs to be abolished before it destroys even more lives. (Read Timothy Weiner´s Legacy of Ashes for more information on the bloody, immoral and incompetent history of that mendacious institution.)Kill the Messenger also broaches the topic of the Clinton reign in Arkansas and the gun running and money laundering out of Mena which took place in plain sight under Clinton´s governorship. The conclusion of the story (like that of Michael Hastings) is highly disturbing and should cause everyone to pause before taking at face value the pronouncements of anyone associated with the CIA--especially when they undertake to defame investigative journalists who later end up dead (gasp!) of ¨suicide by two gunshot wounds to the head¨ (Webb) or in a ¨single-car accident¨ in which the engine block is catapulted 100 yards from the vehicle (Hastings). Perhaps it was the case of Gary Webb which gave birth to the term Arkancide?As far as quality, this film is average--certainly not as good as American Made (starring Tom Cruise)--but the subject matter is important enough to elevate it a notch. People really need to find out the truth about what is going on as they blithely while their days around shopping online."

" Interesting story at its core but movie wasn't well done.
",-0.0954,0.6771,2019-11-05 00:00:00,5,Only reason I kept watching was the fact this had a real life component. After that I was underwhelmed by the movie's fabricated characters. None of the actors came across like they really understood the true people they were portraying - many roles - the news media outlet - the shady CIA agents came across as one dimensional. Made for TV vibe throughout.
" It's dated very quickly
",0.0,-0.8063,2019-10-19 00:00:00,5,"Printers clacking away, newsrooms full of people , hard nosed editors and unlimited expense accounts. They're all a thing of the past, and truth in news has passed with it.
Nowadays you'd be lucky to get two people assigned to a story like this and those two people would be under strict instructions to concentrate on getting dirt on the politicians, not on the harm the scumbags are doing to society.It's done in the style of the Watergate movie with angst ridden idealists thinking they can rid Washington of corruption and make them stick with the principles of the Constitution. Hah! what a laugh!We have the usual plotlines of broken trust in the marriage, the ruin of a career, the breakup of a family and the abandonment by colleagues..... does this sound familiar?
It's no surprise to me that the story was buried and that Gary Webb was destroyed, because this was the dawn of the age of politics as the pathway to riches and power. The Clintons were the new carpetbaggers.At last they could forget about piffling details like policy and get on with looting the till or looking after their sponsors interests.It's not a very good movie despite some good acting and its powerful message, A message which tolls the death knell of unbiased journalism.You won't be seeing anything like this story again in our lifetime because no one cares anymore .
We're inured to the crookery, we're inured to the directionless path of our hopelessly broken system
Any project that tries to highlight the problems stands about the same chance as the fate of the nation."
" Kill the Messenger
",-0.6908,0.9335,2019-09-27 00:00:00,6,"The story of journalist Gary Webb who reported that the CIA were fully aware of and indeed supportive of the sale of cocaine in the US to fund Nicaraguan rebels. Praised heavily for his breaking story, the CIA and the media turned on him later, shattering his life.A truly fascinating tale in that whilst as suggested his story could not be properly substantiated and perhaps was not great journalism, it ultimately appeared to be true. It is also interesting that notwithstanding the quality of the journalism and accuracy of the articles, how far the CIA, his employees and other major papers and the media more generally were prepared to go to discredit him.Renner is quite excellent in this, never presenting Webb as totally right or even that nice but a man with a single passion to stick to his guns.Support cast including the always reliable Platt are first class."
" my notes

" Dark America - Disturbing the American Dream - Kill the Messinger
",-0.7906,0.9806,2019-03-31 00:00:00,8,"When we were young, many of us were quite idealistic; some of us believed in the Kennedy Ideal, others believed in the Reagan Ideal several years later when a new generation of youth emerged in America. Although on opposite sides of the political spectrum, these segments of youthful American society all wanted and hoped for the same things: The American Dream, freedom for all, equality for all, equal opportunity for all, high ethical standards, and to be on the right of side of good and evil.
Then, as we all got older in each generation, we learned that these things that we thought our forefathers fought for in the Second World War, were not actually the things they fought for. They fought for survival; because millions of them had no other choice. Our ancestral mothers worked in factories making weapons because they had to, not because they wanted to. Freedom had a steep price to pay, and our forefathers and mothers paid it. They tried to give us a country that had the best ideals and intentions in the world. But the road to hell is paved with good intentions as Dante would have us believe.
After WW2, the American Dream gradually eroded and faded away; replaced by increasingly more and more vitriolic partisanship within our country. The spirit of cooperation, which existed during WW2 was gone forever, never to be replaced in our lifetime until 911, when national tragedy once again brought us temporarily together. However, those first few months of national unity gradually eroded away as well. Now, we are more polarized than ever; our levels of intolerance have gradually increased. Now, you are either friend or foe, and there is no one left to be in the middle.
That was where Gary Webb tried to be; in the middle. He was apparently not a liberal or a conservative, but tried to be objective. He wanted to try and do what he believed to be the right thing in an occupation that has increasingly become more and more polarized. And like Daniel Ellsberg, he was ruined for his efforts. These episodes (Ellsberg, Webb and others) have shown America to be imperfect in several areas; much to the dismay of those who love Her. There is no perfect country, and all illusions of youth of living in a perfect country are dashed with onset of older adulthood. We wind up doing exactly what our forefathers did; we try to survive the best we can. Some foolish people disregard their survival for questionable outcomes within their countries. They risk their lives for truth, justice and the American Way, but they are much more vulnerable than Superman. This was an American tragedy, and there have been several more like it through the 21st century so far. The Multinational dominance of the world predicted in 1975's Network has come to pass almost word for word from Ned Beatty's terrific dialogue.
The world does not want truth, justice and the American Way; even America does not want these things. In America, the only thing that counts is money and power; all else is merely an illusion. The Original American Dream is completely dead. The rest of the world no longers admires the United States, but it has copied their lifestyle and philosophy of money and power, instead. Maybe someday all this will change, but for now, unless you want a lot of grief in your life, it is probably best for you to get with the program. Good film."
" True story
",0.4215,0.4767,2019-03-27 00:00:00,8,Excellent presentation. Took me several starts and stops to watch the film. The sight of and the sound of Ronald ray-gun is too much for me to put up with.The story is a lesson in life.
" Are We not Hypocrites?
",0.0,-0.9832,2019-01-07 00:00:00,8,"Not only with Gary Webb, but also Michael Hastings and other murders that we don't know about. Now in 2019, we're hypocritically denounced the outright murder of Jamal Khashoggi while our sitting president refused to acknowledge the murder and its intentional nature or the main culprit behind the operation. Other governments, despots, dictators, tyrants, oligarchs, autocrats... (think of Putin of Russia, Duterte of the Philippines, Maduro of Venezuela...) look to our dealings with our own journalists and whistle blowers (e.g. Edward Snowden) as green light to carry out murders of journalists and dissidents of their own. We're a nation of hypocrites and we're no better than others for the paths we have carved out for our own history since the days of our conquest of this land."

And the very same news organizations that today are held up as the only firewall between our continued existence and Trumps inevitable fascism are the organizations who apparently protected the CIA in one of the biggest conspiracies in American history. Moreover the criticism leveled at Webb are for employing the very same lack of journalistic standards that all of those organizations openly and freely admit they use now in attacking Trump. In the end, Webb was only ahead of his time...wanting to believe a story so much he created a story that confirmed his conclusions. Parts of it are probably true probably accurate but most of it is probably not. And none of that matters because like investment bankers the media makes money whether they're right or wrong. They make money making the story about the story the story. And they make you believe whatever it is they need you to believe."

" journalism is dangerous
",-0.4767,0.3567,2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because it shows you that truth is stranger than fiction in a sense because Gary Webb believed his government of innocenct of any wrong doing but stumbled onto information which proved him wrong that he stupidly chose to publish. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" A Real Hero Tale
",0.5574,0.891,2018-10-11 00:00:00,10,"The story of Gary Webb is bigger than any one person and should held in the highest esteem by all that relish the truth, no matter how distasteful it might be. The fact that Mr. Webb had the courage to connect the CIA the cocaine trafficking and risked everything in the process is the stuff of folklore and legend. Jeremy Renner is great and believable as Webb and the entire cast is good in this well paced flick."
" DRUGS ARE BAD. M'KAY?
",-0.5423,-0.9594,2018-09-14 00:00:00,8,"This is an excellent docudrama of reporter Gary Webb (Jeremy Renner) of the San Jose Mercury News who cracked the CIA drug smuggling scandal. The first half of the film concerns his discovery of the story, traveling and talking to individuals. After the story breaks, the champagne flows, and the US is upset. It is time for CIA damage control. It seems Mr. Webb used criminals and drug dealers as a source in a story about criminals and drug dealers so he has no reliable sources. He also is not a saint and as his sources recant their story, his life spirals downward as the messenger becomes the story.The film was done well for the most part. The personal home life of Gary Webb seemed a bit awkward especially the oldest son who laments over his father's affair like a little girl. I know they had to show us how the smear campaigned affected his life, but they could have fabricated a more believable scene.The opening of the film has film footage of presidents and others telling us how bad drugs are for us. I couldn't help think about Mr Mackey of South Park telling us not to do drugs. For those who like historical dramas or conspiracy theories, check it out."
" One of those ""It's All Been A Dream"" and/or ""Imagined"" Movies
",0.25,0.874,2018-09-06 00:00:00,1,"The movie's contents pretend to be totally true. What you are seeing is shown as being NOTHING but the truth and from the perspective of a main character who is so perfect and good, he could never have made a mistake, or chopped down a cherry tree, in his life. Then, at the very end, it's realized that this was only the opinion of this one man. A man who had no witnesses and no sources whatsoever. One man who pieced together President Reagan as a drug-trafficker and Oliver North as his main dealer the way all people who hated Reagan do in their fantasies. This is Hollywood. They don't lean to the left. They topple to that side. Just realize that what you are watching is one of those ""It's all a dream"" stories, and a Left Wing dream at that (this is NOT a spoiler because the movie actually still holds on that it's all true). Since The Left controls all movies and TV shows, their dreams are allowed to be fully realized, and turned into non-fiction. Documentaries too."
" Tough and good
",0.34,0.8648,2018-08-28 00:00:00,7,"This film is based on true events that happened during the war in Nicaragua launched by the rebels against the sandinista regime. CIA allowed the rebels to sell drugs in certain ghettos to get money to finance the rebels' struggle. Gary Webb, a journalist in a minor newspaper became aware of the story and being an honest journalist who loves truth above all and the right of informing the public about it starts a close investigation about it and started publishing it. Of course this attracts a CIA campaign against him that includes smearing his life and damaging his family relationship with his wife and kids. This battle brings him a lot of trouble but he never gives up. This story is told in direct, tough and simple images and scenes in a short, quick and very efficient succession. The main actor performing the journalist role does a good and expressive job."

" More Please
",0.3804,-0.9746,2018-03-26 00:00:00,8,"I know for a fact that my opinion about this movie is directly tied to how close to home it hits. I didn't sell or use crack nor has anyone close to me ever sold or used crack, but I grew up in a time and in an area where it was a big deal and the San Jose Mercury is somewhat a local paper.If the first two sentences of this review don't make sense then let me back up a little. Kill the Messenger is about a reporter by the name of Gary Webb (Jeremy Renner) who uncovered a colossal secretive operation by the CIA to funnel drugs into the USA in order to fund Nicaraguan contras so that they could fight against their government. Although it seems no CIA agent directly bought and sold drugs it was all done with their blessing. This news was like the blow of a sledgehammer to the black community because they were most negatively affected by the influx of drugs.I'm partial to biopics/historical dramas, especially those that uncover conspiracies. Kill the Messenger dealt with an extremely sensitive topic and uncovered a plot that is not far fetched at all. It is not a quantum leap to believe that the CIA used illegal and destructive means to fund fighters they were in favor of. Governments--the U.S. government included--have a history of doing dirty and underhanded things to achieve a desired goal. This is not to say that what they want isn't good but I do say that the ends don't justify the means. Kill the Messenger was done well and was a hard hitting film. Gary Webb wasn't deified or sanctified as though he was some sinless saint that went around uncovering truths. He had his flaws, as all people do, and of course that became an issue. I'm sure this wasn't a popular movie to make but I appreciated it. I say make more movies like this and less mindless garbage."
" Good Potential, Interesting Cast And Story, Rather Mediocre Execution
",0.6808,0.5621,2018-03-10 00:00:00,5,"Well, what wiill I say here? Jeremy Renner is a very decent and strong actor, he can deliver depth and seriousness with a very gentle and exact touch. He sees to be a very tough and deep actor, yet when the film is of secondary rank and of dubious merit, the great cast (like in this movie, there is an outstanding array of talents, including Garcia, Patrick, Winstead among others). 
The story of Gary Webb's Dark Alliance seems like another swell sweet to crack, yet it ain't fly. All the potential of the plot was broken against wrong pacing, awkward dialog, too hasty jumps, and on top of that, too blatant a message which was not only shoved and placed into our mouths but also chewed and swallowed - Webb is The man, the official guys are evil. Too obvious a propaganda step. 
Abother drawback which spoiled it all was a very open and obvious mimicking Oliver Stone's Nixon style of narrative. Come on, guys we have seen it before, only he did it better than you."
" Kill The Messenger is an intelligent investigative drama that will have you hooked from the start.
",-0.4019,0.9131,2018-03-02 00:00:00,8,"Gary Webb, a journalist for a smallish news agency, stumbles upon a story which proves the CIA used cocaine profits from Central American drug smugglers to fund the Contra rebels. Never heard about it? Me neither, and in fact when the full report was published it was pushed aside by a scandal involving Bill Clinton. So, nearly a decade later, it's time to explore this intriguing story and fortunately this film is absolutely compelling. Yes, the film is about the CIA's involvement in Nicaragua, but beneath this is an individual who only desires to report the truth. Investigating a story with this much classification and secrecy results in the possibility of endangering both your career and family. But the biggest detriment, is to yourself. We see Gary Webb slowly degrade as the investigation takes its toll on him, he gradually becomes a broken man so transfixed on this job that he risks losing everything else. I found it to be utterly heartbreaking, yet rather relatable. This drama didn't need to include any thrills or chase sequences (in the fear that it becomes an action film), and yet director Michael Cuesta was bold enough to incorporate these tense pursuits. They worked. I was on edge. Why? Because Gary Webb was a well developed character. I felt for him and wanted him to succeed. This, for me, is Jeremy Renner's best performance. Forget about the supporting cast, this was his for the taking and he owned it. Emotional, physical and charismatic. Should've been nominated for more awards. The first half was a slow burner, but it picked up pace as soon as the story was established. The supporting cast were wasted, Winstead was probably the best out of them all but still underused. But due to a powerful central performance, this film was elevated to an enthralling level of intrigue. Oh, and the final screen texts detailing the aftermath? It crushed me inside. Gutted."
" Interesting true-life tale but hollow at its core
",0.2144,-0.9906,2017-08-09 00:00:00,5,"Kill the Messenger, director Michael Cuesta's re-telling of journalist Gary Webb's expose of the CIA's illegal funding of Nicaraguan Contra rebels and its links to the crack epidemic sweeping across the country, has all the ingredients for a gripping, fact-based drama centred around a story everybody should know more about (at the time, people were distracted by Bill Clinton's White House antics involving Monica Lewinsky). Seminal movies such as All the President's Men and Zodiac portrayed the dangers that come with investigative journalism and managed keep a real-life story suspenseful despite many knowing the outcome already. Kill the Messenger sadly doesn't achieve much of this, and although the movie is competently made and solidly acted, it struggles to hold the attention it should demand by playing things frustratingly formal.Jeremy Renner stars as Webb, the goateed, informally-dressed San Jose Mercury News reporter who carries more than a whiff of anti- establishment about him. While investigating the government seizure of drug dealer's property, even when they've been found innocent, he is handed court papers which seem to reveal that a major drug runner is actually a CIA operative. It's a revelation that will change Webb's life, and he is soon on the government's radar when he follows leads to kingpin Rick Ross (Michael Kenneth Williams) and eventually to Managua to meet with cartel boss Norwin Meneses (Andy Garcia). Everything he uncovers seems to suggest that the CIA, committing high treason in the process, is indirectly funding the wave of crack decimating entire neighbourhoods throughout the U.S. Webb reports his findings in a three-part series entitled Dark Alliance, which quickly becomes one of the internet's first viral hits, before the CIA decide to turn his world upside down.In many ways, the story of a little guy being cruelly picked apart by higher powers is comparable to the one told in The Insider. Yet Michael Mann's masterpiece also demonstrated that a film can be grounded in fact and procedural while keeping the audience engrossed in the story it's telling. Kill the Messenger wisely reserves a large chunk of the running time for what Webb went through after breaking the story, but much of this is bogged down in clichéd domestic squabbles, with Rosemarie DeWitt finding herself criminally underwritten as the nagging wife whose feelings drastically change from one scene to the next. However, it has its moments, especially when showing how Webb was surgically discredited while his bosses (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Oliver Platt) slowly distanced themselves from the negative attention. Renner manages to carry the film despite not being given a whole lot to do apart from exchanging a few ""I'm right, you're wrong,"" arguments with his colleagues. The real-life story alone is shocking enough to make the film worth a watch, but there's a emptiness at its core."
" Good movie.....lousy history.
",0.4404,-0.9928,2017-07-27 00:00:00,6,"To start off with, I really enjoyed Renner's performance......and I think it's a story worth telling. But what I noticed most of all is the almost endless inaccuracies, omissions, and misleading info while watching it. Setting the record straight:-Blandon did NOT testify that the CIA came to him and asked them to run drugs. He testified that it was either Meneses or Enrique Bermudez (in the grand jury transcript called ""Enrique Ramunez""), it's not clear which one (Blandon's English wasn't clear at times), is who asked him. In either case, neither person amounts to representing the CIA: Meneses definitely was not, and Bermudez wasn't either. And Blandon himself later specifically denied that Bermudez asked him to raise money through drug smuggling. Meneses said the same thing. The SJMN quoted Bermudez (via Blandon) as saying the ""ends justify the means"". But Blandon himself said he didn't take that as meaning they should traffic in drugs.-The drug cartels had set up routes and were mass importing the drugs into California and Florida (and elsewhere) before the Contras were even in business. (Ergo the Contras sparking any crack epidemic (as Webb claimed) in LA or elsewhere is preposterous.) -It's also worth pointing out the crack epidemic did not end when the Contras shut down in 1990. Ergo, the trade obviously didn't hinge on their (or their supporters) involvement.-To illustrate the previous point: according to 'The War on Drugs: An International Encyclopedia', by the late 1980's: ""an estimated 300 Colombian trafficking groups and 20,000 Colombians were involved in the cocaine trade in the United States. At least 5,000 of the Colombians who worked for the cartels lived in the Miami area and another 6,000 in the Los Angeles area."" In other words: the cartels had about as much manpower in the United States alone than were in the entire Contra movement. (The Medellin cartel employed 750,000 people in Medellin.) -Ross had other (non-Contra) suppliers besides Blandon and he was mixed up in drugs before he ever met him. Other LA dealers (like ""Tootie"" Reese) had established links with the South American cartels before Blandon met Ross. -Webb gives the number (in 'Dark Alliance'; the book not the series) Blandon sold to Ross at around 5 tons. By DEA estimates, more cocaine went to Los Angeles in a *single* year (i.e. 1980; before Blandon was selling to Ross) than Ross sold over 8-10 years.-Ross's suppliers were not Contras who went into dealing to support them.....they were dealers sympathetic to their cause who kept most of the money they made. That's an important distinction. Most provable estimates of what they gave the Contras was around 50-100 thousand dollars.-Ross and Blandon had more money than the United States gave the Contras total (we are talking in the hundreds of millions). So if the Contras were running on drug money, why did the war grind to a halt once the USA cut off aid? Furthermore, why even bother with the Contra aspect of Iran-Contra (which got them maybe 2 million from the diversions of the arms sales to Iran) when all that coke money was supposedly out there?-The movie also depicts (some would say ""fabricates"" is a more accurate term) a number instances of personal harassment (and contact) of Webb by the government and its agencies. Before he even writes the story, some ""agents""/""a few guys from D.C."" meet with him and try to warn him off and also make a implied threat against his family. Ray Liota plays a CIA agent who sneaks into Webb's hotel room in the middle of the night to tell him he is right. And finally, Webb fires a warning shot at a guy hanging around his car at night. Following that, some unidentified people start going through Webb's files while he is talking to the police. To my knowledge, even Webb didn't claim ANY of these events happened. I think the closest thing to this was the fact Webb once shot a would-be car thief who came at him. But this was in Kentucky and years before he came across the Dark Alliance story.-Webb did not endorse the wild conspiracy theories put forth by a lot of people like Maxine Waters. But he didn't distance himself from these people either. So that didn't help his cause. -At the end of the film, a number of misleading statements appear on the screen. For one, it mentions the the Director of the CIA's appearance in a ""town hall"" type meeting with the citizens of south central Los Angeles, and that the director left the CIA a month later. That leaves the impression Deutch left the CIA because of the Dark Alliance series. Deutch was actually forced out because the Clinton administration was upset with his testimony to Congress on Iraq. A statement is also made that the CIA released a report that acknowledged the fact they ""...associated with members of the Contra movement who engaged in drug trafficking."" True. But just not the ones Webb wrote about. The mentioned report specifically denies that the agency ever had any contact with Ross, Blandon, or Meneses. Furthermore, that report (and the unmentioned DOJ report), far from being a vindication for the Dark Alliance series, blew a great many holes in the story. And finally, Webb's two shot suicide is mentioned. The movie states it was ""ruled"" a suicide. But there is little doubt. Webb had made arrangements for his cremation (as well as other things), and even his own family does not doubt it was a suicide based on his actions before hand. (Nick Schou covers this in 'Kill The Messenger'. In a way, it was kind of good this aspect of Webb's life was omitted from the film because it made for some depressing reading.)So a good movie.....but pretty flimsy history."
" Kill The Messenger asks: When Does Truth Become a Lie?
",-0.5267,0.8684,2017-04-12 00:00:00,9,"What happened to this powerful movie in its initial release? Why do film production and distribution companies choose to be involved with important works such as this - then fail to back it up with adequate support? The Focus company almost seem to have caved into demands (and/or threats?) in a similar way newspapers may also do when they fail to support their own investigative journalists. In murky cases like this finding clear truths will never be easy but someone has to bring shocking situations to public attention. Perhaps too often this could be America fighting America or C.I.A. against Congress, and so forth! If the C.I.A. had any involvement with introducing the crack cocaine trade into Los Angeles to fund Nicaraguan rebels - then of course it needs to be investigated.Why did the distributors virtually seem to 'Kill the Messenger' by failing in their all important advance promotions? Some TV promotional advertisements apparently began to air after most cinemas had stopped running the picture! If you have a story dealing with something as important as an honest man putting his life in jeopardy to expose a gross injustice (especially if it may involve top law enforcement agencies) then everyone who seeks truth, needs to be fully supportive. Sadly, seems this may not always be so when it comes to exposing certain possibly corrupt government institutions. Thank heavens for those members of the public who campaigned the distributor to have this powerful work finally reissued. 'Messenger' is one of the better compelling studies of the pressures that investigative journalists and seekers of justice invariably face while covering controversial issues. Pity there aren't more productions of this caliber. The film is well made, intelligently scripted, features strong performances, and committed production values. The atmospheric score helps add appropriate moodiness. The last caption in the movie also indirectly questions the coroners ruling on the cause of death for Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Gary Webb, as being:- Suicide from multiple gunshot wounds to the head......Recommended to any viewer who wants to see the good fight fought and truth (wherever possible) treated as paramount to all ends. Don't miss this one."

" If Ever There Were a Film That Deserved Top Billing and High Rating..
",0.2023,-0.7596,2017-03-10 00:00:00,10,"It's difficult to believe that this came out three years ago. As far as films go, what could possibly be more relevant? For those that are not familiar with the subject matter, I won't include any intentional spoilers, but it's pretty compelling.Integrity and ethics are now going extinct in the world of American journalism. Too many gave in to greed and violence, but it's difficult to hold it against those who folded. Some people will attempt to place tremendous pressure on whistleblowers, their families, and apparently anyone around them! Maybe there will come a day when enough people will stand up for integrity and ethics? Or maybe there won't be anyone left to stand up for? Anyways, good film!"
" I don't understand it.
",0.0,-0.9631,2017-01-21 00:00:00,2,"Interesting story of the vile corruption in America.Poorly researched.Poorly put together.Total failure in showing how and why Mr Webb supposedly killed himself with two bullets.Or was murdered.Mr Renner played very monotonously. Inhuman.Watchable.Disappointing.I don't know if there was a casting issue for Webb's wife. I'd've probably killed myself if I'd a scraggy wife like that. Not an appealing choice. But in real life he had several children with her, so probably was not her.Why on earth did he pop off to stay in that hotel? And if your bike's stolen why do you add to your woes by then vandalising your own car? There's no sense in it. We need an investigative reporter to decypher this movie it seems.A remake is necessary to show the exact events of the true story. Ie not US corruption, but Mr Webb's death."
