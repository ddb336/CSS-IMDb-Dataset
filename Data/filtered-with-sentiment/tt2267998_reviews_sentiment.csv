" Interesting end
",0.4019,0.981,2021-03-28 00:00:00,9,This is a 2.5 hour movie and sometimes these days it's difficult for me to stick with the longer movies but this never felt long. You were always curious what was going on. Let's just say it didn't quite go the way I expected but I was intrigued the whole time. The acting was great. This could for sure be considered a slow burn and I'm actually currently watching the TV show Sharp Objects by the same author and this is paced much better than that. There's a couple things I didn't particularly thing got solved or like how they went at the end but overall a great movie.
" A masterpiece
",0.6249,0.0,2021-03-20 00:00:00,10,As many times as I've watched this movie I can't get enough of it.
" Ending sucked Unfortunately
",-0.6597,-0.9966,2021-03-19 00:00:00,6,"The film is ok you do hate her character and are sat ready for her either to end up caught ( how I wouldve liked it to go) or he ends up in jail her still missing. I'm sorry but the ending wasnt plausibly. First thing Ben Afflecks character wouldve done in real life the second she reappeared with her fake kidnap story is Go on national tv and say how he never bought any of that stuff and that his wife had set him up for murder, taking in tow with him the previous boyfriend she had set up for rape & say shes admitted the kidnap was a fake and she murdered the guy in cold blood.. other points How does he suddenly become dumb?!? Obviously the babies not his it's the guys that she murdered hes last dude to cum inside her, also the guy she murder said he had cameras every inch of the house therefore theyd show her brutal murder and dipping her night dress in wine, for the cops to actually see. So major plot holes everywhere, it wouldve been most satisfying ending to see her caught out on all those things and arrested and jailed. Because of that ending I dont think I could rewatch this, I wouldve if not for that and it wouldve been good enough watch"
" impressive film that guides the audience
",0.5106,0.9258,2021-03-18 00:00:00,9,What you love most about the movie is that it can guide the audience. The director did a very successful job in making him love the character he wanted in the movie and show the character he wanted badly. I really liked the movie.
" Great movie but I am pissed off
",-0.6428,-0.9159,2021-03-18 00:00:00,9,"First of all, no question this movie is absolutely great!!
But the ending really annoys the eff out of me. First of all, Amy fakes being kidnapped and acts out this scene in front of the security cameras to make it seem like she is bleeding, she was being raped and she is suffering. But she has been there for many days if not even weeks, so as if in all of these weeks, there is not one time where she passes the cameras normally. Also she said that she was chained to the bed all the time, but why did she act out this dramatic blood scene by the window then, when the rich guy has already left, which was also shown by the cameras.
I know that Nick didn't want to lost custody of his baby and blabla but he could have won a trial against her. I am 100% that there would have been enough evidence and that just really pisses me off.
I hate that she got away with everything and the worst thing that has happened to her was her being robbed, which was not satisfying enough.
It's still a great movie tho."
" Perverted psycho drama...
",-0.5423,0.1027,2021-03-17 00:00:00,9,My hate score is 9 stars out of 10. I feel i don't have a brain of my own. These 149 minutes were awesome
" Had me on the edge of my seat
",0.0,0.8777,2021-03-14 00:00:00,9,"A story that keeps you locked in until the end, stellar characters and a profound social critique. All elements that combined make a really good movie. Add David Fincher's direction and a couple of great twists, you've got an exceptional movie. Gone Girl has no limits in the development of the story. It shows exactly how the public's opinion is fondamental in one's ongoing confrontation with social values. Values that can even alter one's following the principal of ""Innocent until proven guilty"" if they're broken. Nevertheless, the presence of a new and compelling part of the story, is just enough to turn the tables. For the public is gullible, and can be swayed if approached properly.
Rosamund Pike brings to life a character and a performance that is just unheard of. Able to cry on command, ruthless and with a tongue like a serpent. Next to her stands Ben Affleck, who offers a great portrail of a well behaved, edjucated and yet frustrated man, who wishes his wife just didn't exist.
Those performances however, could not have been enough without Fincher's touch behind the camera, composing such shots who define the character's emotions and thoughts, without any verbal aid. This acute picture, is a true masterclass thriller."
" Worthless
",-0.4404,0.0,2021-03-14 00:00:00,2,Don't watch it. Read the book. Don't waist your time with this screenplay. I can't believe Gillian was able to do this with her own story?!

" No benefit gained from the movie
",0.5267,-0.6798,2021-03-08 00:00:00,1,"I watched the movie and asked myself after finishing it: So What? What did I get from watching this movie? Literally nothing..
in addition, there are a lot of mistakes in the film. The movie claims that the life of Nick has become the focus of an intense media that even at the airport the story of Nick and Amy is shown on TV.. But Amy walks at a petrol station and sits in a restaurant normally without disguising herself..! Really WTF!
Besides, the first half of the movie tries overactedly to convince us with an idea which you know from inside that it is not going to be the case..
Overall, my feeling is that the film is suitable more for the late 90s or early 2000s mentality, not at all for the developed-smart techniques/plots the movie-industry has developed recently.."
" Stunning crime,thriller..!
",0.4389,0.8464,2021-03-07 00:00:00,9,"A wife try to frame his cheating husband as a murderer..first half of the movie we cannot guess who is culprit and when they reveal the truth really it surprise us and again it gives many shocks..
I start to watch this movie withouy any expectation but really it satisfy me and enduces to watch again and again..
Nice photography and all acted soo well..
Must watchable movie..."
" One of the best films ever made
",0.6369,0.9779,2021-03-02 00:00:00,10,"I am so in love with the darkness in this film, the way it's shown and the cool girl monologue- Rosamund Pike is unbelievable amazing in this! Yes, amazing is the word! Thanks to the makers for creating this marvel!"
" Not great, not terrible
",-0.6645,0.9246,2021-03-02 00:00:00,5,"First half of the film was interesting but somewhere in the middle (for me dropping the money bag) it started to have so many unrealistic plot holes that it became unbelievable all together. I will not rewrite all the mistakes, as there are many reviews where it is already done, and they are justified. Although I wouldnt say it deserves a rating 1 but somewhere in the middle at least for me. And people who didnt notice the unfinished storylines and gave it a high rating, I would recommend to get more acquainted with dramatic psychology movies and you start to experience the realistic build of the narrative (for example Kieslowski film ""A Short Film About Love"" or Farhadi ""A Separation""."
" People take films too seriously
",-0.1779,0.5142,2021-03-01 00:00:00,8,"People expect films to be completely bullet proof, you can pick holes in every single Plot line but you just have to let your mind go with it.This is brilliant if you can just enjoy what you are seeing instead of sitting there the whole time trying to find things wrong with it because guess what? You will.The more you look for problems the more appear, simple as that.Films to me are something to get lost in, a story line to take you away. This film won't insult your intelligence like some of these people make out"
" The things we do for love and validation!!
",0.6988,0.9863,2021-03-01 00:00:00,9,"What worked:
The first credit should go to the writers of the book and so then to the screenplay writers of the movie who made it possible to make it happen in the big screen. It's one of David's good works as a director and amazes me with this awesome movie. The movie is poetic. The mood and the climate of the movie is set very well, making us feel like we are exploring an unexplored world, filled with secrets and mysteries. It's one of those movies with a very powerful stories and keeping us on the edge of our seats till the very end, and even more after the movie ends. Rosamund's portrayal was very profound and hugely commendable. She made sure the movie kept its moments alive. It's a very well executed piece of art that deserves multiple viewingWhat did not work:
Of course, the movie has plot holes and scenes that needs revising to make it an authentic and reliable source. If I were asked, I would have framed some of the scenes a bit differently so that we get that the character(s) were sophisticated in their ideas
Final verdict: highly recommended"
" True to the book
",0.4215,-0.4404,2021-02-27 00:00:00,9,What starts as a pretty ordinary day for Nick Dunne starts to unravel when he gets a call from a neighbor telling him that his front door is open and the cat is outside. Returning home he finds his wife is missing in suspicious circumstances. Lots of trusts and turns keeping you guessing if Nick killed his wife.
" Trash
",0.0,0.1511,2021-02-25 00:00:00,5,"Unrealistic, overcomplicated ending which has nothing to do with how things would pan out in real life. Not worth wasting 2 hours and a half."

The good way to enjoy it is to discuss about it with defferent gender friends!I feel painful in the first sweet meeting scene.Their meeting and breaking up are depicted alternatively. How was such a sweet days of them broken? Or rather, I wonder if romance can't be without acting each roles originally. Sadly, I know why they resulted in that bad end.""What are you thinking about?""In conclusion, nobody knows what someone thinks. Only you know that. It might be better to think everyone is ""the other"". To keep a relationship of trust, what I can do is only to believe my partner and to try being enough to let him believe me.

Everybody always believes what the media says even if it's true or not, because we don't know what that person on the news is going through, and this movie got that message out they so perfectly."

This should have gotten an Oscar for its brilliant pacing and writing. On top of Rosamund Pike's stunning performance this is a movie that will make jaws drop for years to come.

",0.5399,-0.6834,2021-02-09 00:00:00,10,"I'm not one for ""unhappy"" endings but Gone Girl is an exception. This movie gets it all right even if it's all so wrong. The performance from Rosamund Pike is breathtakingly horrifying. The way she can seem so innocent and such a victim while also seeming so unnerving and sinister is great. Let's not for get Mr. Affleck, he does a wonderful job as the unlikable yet innocent victim here. The whole cast was great! And the storyline and climax, good god, you just can't look away. Even during that horrific murder scene( poor Neil Patrick Harris deserved better than that)."

" Ending was not satisfying
",-0.357,0.7177,2021-02-08 00:00:00,7,"I was a 9/10 throughout the movie...up until the final 7 minutes. Yeah it's a commentary on herd mentality, social media, the gullibility of the masses. Acting was spectacular. Pacing had me hooked. Guessing what is going on for the entire runtime. Villain-switching. All that. Wonderful.But, for the love of God, I was itching for that woman to get her comeuppance. When she became ""trapped"" in NPH's home, I was like, ""Yes! He's going to control her now and she'll get a taste of what she's been dishing. Or if the thieving couple came out the woodwork at the end and revealed her lies. Or if the detective poked an undeniable hole during the FBI questioning where these lemmings would see through Amy's B.S. Any one of these turnarounds would've had this movie be a 10 for me. Alas, that gratification never came.So this movie was more about the twists and turns of the journey because the destination was utter garbage."

Ok, some things were unrealistic, but I was willing to ignore them, since I like the idea of the story. I was sure, that my final rating would be a 9 or even a 10. Of course an ending could ruin a movie, but what should go wrong here? Maybe a 9 or worst case an 8 if the end is lousy.S P O I L E R :

" Great movie. And want to know why it didn't get the awards it should have?
",0.4442,0.1754,2021-02-02 00:00:00,10,"I'll tell you why. Because this movie committed the cardinal sin that the media doesn't like --it actually criticized the press (and made them the lazy indolent villans they usually are). You can see it very obviously in the character who shows up towards the middle of the movie who's obviously based upon Nancy Grace. Oh how ""Nancy"" changed her tune when the truth sort of came out and she had to find a new boogyman. Plus this is by far Ben Affleck's best work."

Overly long, I fast forwarded through the most predictable parts of which there are plenty. Acting is great, however. The only reason I gave it more than 2 stars is the acting. I'm glad I previewed it on Hulu. I had considered buying it because of all the good reviews. But I'm reminded over and over again that critics don't know squat. Sicario, The Invisible Man (2018 version), The Goonies, Ferris Bueller's Day Off. All terrible movies that I watched because of critics. I'm glad I didn't waste any money on this movie. The ending alone is enough to make Hulk want to smash."
" amy-""amazing amy was always one step ahead of me"".
",0.0,0.989,2021-01-25 00:00:00,8,"What I liked
1 A female anti-hero who has her own brain
2. Intelligent story with super engaging pace
3. Connotations of cultural issues.What I didn't like
1. Major red flag for the audience (imitation problem)This is jarring to stay but we have very few female anti-heroes who uses her brain in the crime/thriller genre so gone girl is refreshing. The movie is brilliant in all aspects (specially props to the actor for her thrilling acting) but the cultural connotations like this line ""amazing Amy was always one step ahead of me"" has stuck with me. Amy is a dangerous predator but whatever she became is a reflection of how her parents wanted her to be. They forced her to never ""fail"", the men in her life always wanted her to be the ""cool girl"". She was never accepted as her true self, so she believed that everyone has to act a certain way to be acceptable. She believed ""I forged this man"" so that he becomes an acceptable person in society instead of a mediocre penniless guy. This controlling self-destructive mentality is so deeply rooted in her soul that it corrupted her into a gone girl (someone who truly lost her sanity). Please remember you're loved the way you're. This reflection is what makes this story 2x more strong and compelling.Talking about the imitation problem. Yes, these anti-heroes give us an adrenaline rush, but I want to reiterate that movies are fictional and made for entertainment. Amy is a crazy controlling person with serious anti-social tendencies. There is no way to justify her horrible acts. Keep that in mind and be cautious around anyone who believes imitating Amy is cool.

" People need better standards for what a ""good movie"" is.
",0.7003,0.3021,2021-01-24 00:00:00,2,"So this is one of those movies which for whatever reasons gains a lot of positive media attention. So the people who watch movies for the social experience and don't involve their thinking anywhere in the viewing process watch it, echo the media's reviews and then pat each other on the back how well they understood it.Unfortunately for me I cannot disengage my critical thinking like most of the people who reviewed this highly. And to be honest the plot is so offensively poor and full of plot holes and convoluted events for the sake of pushing the story along that it ended up completely overstaying its welcome. To get a few things out of the way - 1) The acting. Most people say it was good, I quite honestly did not find it even remotely close to the decent category. Ben Affleck seems completely apathetic throughout and Rosamund Pike pretty much has one blinkless stare for her ""psycho persona"". There's no nuance, no character development, no pallet of emotions the characters go and act through but I guess this could be chalked up to personal preference. The cinematography was ok. 3) The pacing was way off as 70% of the scenes did not contribute in any way to convey additional information to the audience or move the plot along. Instead they mostly repeated the same just slightly different. Like repeating a joke over and over and just changing your tone, hoping to finally get a laugh.The only reason I can think of for the high score is that the story keeps introducing new characters mimicking the plot moving along so people were entertained. Problem is the storytelling is abysmal due to the plethora of plot holes. In order to get the story where it needed to you have a few presuppositions. 1) The police are completely incompetent and 2) the characters themselves do not care for continuity so they never point out errors in it. Here's a few examples: When Amy wanted to frame her husband she left her diary in an oven, just lightly singed around the edges but not enough to distort the writing, which basically said ""I am afraid of my husband"". Aside from the ""clue"" being asininely convenient and should make any detective raise an eyebrow especially considering the location, but anyone who knows how ovens work would know that if it had started burning, it would have to be manually put out to save it. It's the equivalent of painting bloody footsteps to the person you want to frame, putting a bloody knife in their hand then hiding behind the nearby curtain with your shows sticking out.
Here's another example. At one point the police find traces of blood in the house and after conducting their analysis they deduce that ""the splatters indicate a blunt object trauma"". Fair enough, they do this type of analysis often and it in fact extremely accurate...if only the movie didn't later on show us that there was no blunt object involved and instead she drained some of he blood in a bowl and spilled it out. Good policing there!
Here's another example. When she goes to live with Desi he tells her there are cameras everywhere. So she fakes being sexually assaulted and slits his throat with a box cutter. The movie expects us to believe that nobody bothered digging into the murdered person's case, nobody cared to view the bloody security camera footage and easily conclude that her story is crap. Hell, even when she tells her story Nick (notice, not the police but a civilian) brings up the question ""how did she get the box cutter if they were in the bedroom"" - a valid, logical question that we had been asking ourselves. Yet the nearby police officer goes ""come on man, just be happy she's safe"". Again, absolutely asinine plot contrivances.And the worst part of it all was the ending. After she basically manipulates everyone thanks to the complete incompetence and obliviousness of everyone around her...there's never a retribution, never any vengeance, no, she gets exactly what she wanted and Nick just goes along with it, blueballing the entire audience. I would have even been ok with letting it slide if her manipulation was indeed masterful, but it was never that. In fact there were at least 7 different occasions when Nick could have secretly recorded her in video or audio and proven beyond any doubt what she is like, but no, he just shrugs and goes along with it as if living with a psycho is an ok prospect, without even so much as trying to leave or change anything.The moral of the story: If you're a woman you can manipulate everyone and get away with it. God job, movie you're an absolute failure.Oh any apparently some people are fawning over the ""social commentary"" that the media are like vultures and should not be trusted. This is such a profound insight that I ecpect the sequel to gone girl to to explore the even more groundbreaking ""don't put your hand on a hot stove""....Seriously, people, please get some better standards for what a good movie is."

" Modish Thriller That Doesn't Fully Deliver
",0.1027,0.829,2021-01-21 00:00:00,6,"On the morning of July 5, Amy Dunne(Pike) is reported missing by her husband, Nick(Affleck). However, the police's investigation draws increasing suspicion on to Nick for the disappearance and possible murder of his wife. At first it only feeds you the information that the characters in the film know and as they learn it. All evidence points to Nick and that he is a murderer. But the film also makes him seem sympathetic and leaves an underlying inkling that he's actually innocent. About halfway through the film, it reveals what really happened. Because of the way its played out thus far, it fills you in in the most ungainly way. By simply having Amy narrate what she did, why and how; it isn't clear why she's saying all this other than to explain everything to the audience. This is one of the clumsyiest deliveries of exposition possible and certainly doesn't fit in a film that tries to be so sophisticated. But it's there to shine some light on the situation, change the viewers perception and it gets the job done. From here on out it becomes more and more apparent that Amy is a cunning psychopath and the villain in this story. This performance earned Rosamund Pike an Oscar nomination and also served as a sort of break through role. For fairly obvious reasons, she's very convincing in the role. Another performance in this film which is often overlooked due to Pike's, is Ben Affleck's. Affleck combines just the right amount of the flustered victim while not appearing entirely lost and defenseless. I might also add that contrary to the previous two are Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry. Neither are particularly good actors and they aren't well suited in their respective roles either.The film runs at 149 minutes and you certainly feel all of them. Just when you might think it's coming to a close it brings forth yet another chapter to prolong the story. And the scenes themselves play out slowly as David Fincher takes his time with each one and inserts a unique and enigmatic style. But like the rather vogue writing, it gives you the hint of something before stumbling and lowering your expectations.
Gone Girl is a film with a dark serenity to it which also serves as an intensifier to its crafty characters, clipped dialouge and serpentine plot."

" A well crafted film
",0.2732,0.9729,2021-01-14 00:00:00,8,"Gone girl is a dark, compelling and unpredictable thriller.
The story kept me intrigued the entire time. The first half is all about the investigation into Amy's disappearance, slow unraveling of Nick's dirty secrets, reminiscing about the troubled history of Nick and Amy's marriage as told in Amy's dairy. You're dole out with just enough information to make you think you've figured things out but then, here comes the second half with its wicked twist that changes everything, characters reveal sides to them that are quite shocking and intriguing, the story becomes much more thrilling, dangerous and deranged. Although, I find the ending to be a bit far fetched. Acting-wise, Rosamund Pike delivers a remarkable performance as the manipulative, mischievous Amy. Ben Affleck delivers one of the best performances of his career as Nick Dunne. The rest of the cast also contributed in making this movie an interesting story to follow. Technical-wise; The score, location work, set design, editing and cinematography all complement the narrative ably.
Overall, Gone girl is a texturally rich, tense psychological thriller with strong character work, intelligent cinematic touches, and wonderful performances."
" great movie, disappointing ending
",0.2263,-0.4045,2021-01-12 00:00:00,8,"I watched this for the first time last night (little late to the party i know), and i couldn't stop watching. the entire movie was filled with twists and turns and it was extremely entertaining the whole time.SPOILER:
the end made me a little mad because he still stayed with her even though she is psychotic. i figured that the main character, his sister, and the detective could have figured out some way to get him out of the marriage but they just gave up. i feel that the ending could have also just been to show us the wife is such a genius manipulator that after everything he had to stay with her. still disappointed though."
" Unsatisfying
",0.0,-0.9923,2021-01-05 00:00:00,5,"I didn't care for the book and I definitely didn't care for the movie either.Sure, it wasn't boring but the plot is so predictable and standard, there's nothing remarkable or special about it.Both protagonists are unlikeable, selfish and manipulative, each one of them plays the victim but they both aren't.Amy running away is not a novelty idea, the part about her getting robbed is adding an unnecessary detail and her killing her ex from high school is just trying to desperately save a plot that was subpar to begin with.These two people deserve each other.Just one remark: I didn't like that the movie insinuates, that women generally make up rape allegations. That so rarely happens and makes rape victims suffer unnecessarily when people don't believe them."
" A Great Movie

Although it's been 2 years since I watched it, sometimes I still think about some scenes in this movie. Actings, directing and story are just great."
" Beautiful and intense Thriller with best career performance by Rosamund Pike
",0.8689,0.9386,2021-01-02 00:00:00,9,"This movie kept me glued to my seat from the first moment until the last. Cinematography is great as well as the complex and articulate story which goes back and forth with narration in such an Interesting way and is told perfectly. Pike is so perfect for the role, as her psychology remains such a mistery througout the whole story. I really enjoyed this movie as you can see by the rating that I gave it, If I must say one thing that diden't convince me 100%, it has to be Ben Affleck acting, which, at times seems a bit uptight and not really natural considering the circumstances that he encounters himself in, but again, really great movie all together."
" Overrated but Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck shine
",0.0,-0.4872,2021-01-02 00:00:00,6,"Starts off well but by the middle third, significant pole holes are already appearing and the final third just collapses into utter nonsense.Rosamund Pike and, surprisingly, Ben Affleck excel in their roles, with Pike delivering a pitch-perfect portrayal of narcissistic personality disorder (as anyone who's encountered such a person can attest to). The sister and the detective are also completely convincingly portrayed.Neil Patrick Harris is woefully miscast and delivers an appallingly bad performance - a humourless Barney Stinson, basically. Tyler Perry's performance is paint by numbers, and I've no idea why people praise such unremarkable acting."

Wanna watch a similiar movie? Watch double jeopardy..... So much of a better ending. Most people I know like a good ending. There are a few nutcases out there that like miserable endings......even a bullet to her head would have been better. Or at least being taken away by the cops....

" A engaging slow paced thriller delivering a fine twist
",0.5574,0.8067,2020-12-26 00:00:00,8,I was utterly impressed by the plot. Fincher seems to have a handle on slow burning suspense like no other. He is apt at making tension truly palpable even though there isn't always a lot going on. In that way it kinda reminds me of Zodiac. Finally he combined the classic who dun it with a really interesting second and third act. Sublime.
" Great movie in spite of the ending seeming not quite perfect
",-0.3643,0.9801,2020-12-20 00:00:00,9,"I just rewatched this film. I had forgotten a lot of the details. Overall I found it to be a fun movie to rewatch and felt that it holds-up better than most. If anything it might be more interesting to watch following the ""me too"" movement than it was when it came out just before the me too movement. Although the media focusing so much attention on this one story seemed more difficult for me to accept in 2020 than it did around 2014. There are just so many crazy news stories in 2020 that this sort of narrative doesn't seem like the kind of thing that could spark the kind of public attention which is shown in the movie. The 2014 world for this story seems to treat this missing wife story with the kind of interest one would only accept in 2020 of the wife or husband were big celebrity prior to one of them going missing.The other issue I have with the movie is that the very end just doesn't seem to wrap things up quite enough for a few characters. In particular the relationship between the wife and busband's twin after the wife returns isn't even really addressed. Afleck's character would seemingly need to be seen telling the sister if he is going to chose her or his wife to be his closest confident long term. He never has that opportunity in the end to show where he standsI'm not sure if maybe I'd like a scene which takes place years in the future or a few more months or maybe just a few days after the movie ends; But the male lead agreeing to have the baby just didn't seem to me like enough of an explanation of what a viewer could/should expect to happen down the line with the story to end right there.Both of these are relatively mild critiques. The story is overall largely original and well constructed. The acting and filming are great. There is some elements of visual art within the cinematography without it being distracting. The story really is only partially mysterious and not too surprising for the first half. What makes the story very interesting is what happens in the last half. I haven't read the book. But I see that the book author adapted her book into the feature film.The VO is used well. Often book authors use too much VO for adaptions. The pacing doesn't feel too slow or too rushed. And the story is interesting to follow. And given that both of the main characters have some serious flaws, it's important for the side characters to be likable and for the overall insanity of the story to keep the viewer interesting in the outcome in spite of the dysfunction and coldness of the main characters. The film succeeds in those regards. The twin sister, lawyer and main detective are all sympathetic characters to make up for the main two characters being largely flawed.It's definitely a film that I'd argue is worth seeing if you haven't yet had the opportunity."

",0.0129,0.83,2020-12-18 00:00:00,5,"Despite the utterly ridiculous plot holes, I did find Gone Girl fairly entertaining- at least for the first hour and a half. Rosamund Pike is exceptional and Ben Affleck is better than he is given credit for. But there are just too many ludicrous twists and turns and none of it makes much sense. I think this could have worked better as a mini-series which would allow time to develop the plot realistically. Always nice to see digs at the witch hunt mentality of trash mainstream television though. Overall, just far too long and convoluted."
" Immy's review : A wistful, atmospheric masterpiece
",0.6249,0.8769,2020-12-14 00:00:00,9,"Gone girl is perhaps one of the best murder mystery films, incorporating a dark and psychological tone with stark character analysis and incredible performances. The movie is so comprehensive and explores every little detail involving the mystery around Amy's disappearance. The atmosphere remained dark and suspenseful throughout, boosted by the incredibly tense soundtrack. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike gave brilliant performances and possessed a kinetic and fiery chemistry together. Both of their characters were as complex and entertaining each other, and the movie made room to dissect both their personal emotions and intentions with one another. The plot twist was legendary and was executed so well and so uniquely, as the movie leads you astray from the real truth for the first half of the film, completely shocking you with the final revelation. Overall I highly recommend."

" Fincher versus genre
",0.0,0.9348,2020-12-08 00:00:00,7,"David Fincher is a skilful director, and his 'Gone Girl' is compulsively watchable. But the movie ultimately comes up against the limitations of its own genre. It's not so much a satire (which paints an exagerated portrait of the world out of righteous anger at how things really are) but rather a piece of gleeful cynicism, a tale of horrid human beings each trying to ensnare the others in their plot. As such, it reminded me slightly of Tom Wolfe's famous novel, 'The Bonfire of the Vanities', but without the associated social commentary; there's potentially interesting material in the strange life of its female protagonist, but the film ultimately reduces her to a straight pyschopath, which to me at least is not so interesting. The ending is also a bit anticlimactic, as if the story is one trick short of a full house. I enjoyed it anyway, but Fincher has definitely done more stimulating work elsewhere."
" An Absolute Mess

Because it doesn't. It's completely nonsensical.

" Daring and Vindictive
",0.3612,0.6501,2020-12-03 00:00:00,8,"The most significant thing that's being emphasize in this film is the conspiring story of a husband and wife relationship. Director David Fincher phenomenally distinguished the resentful side and perspective of the two main characters (played by Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike) and guides audiences through dark and pessimistic plot development. The mood throughout the film complements with the mysterious conflict and I liked how Fincher made the idea of the climax extremely confidential. Rosamund Pike delivers her most menacing and adventurous performance of her career and makes ""Gone Girl"" more interesting and engaging to watch."

" Preparation for Mank: Gone Girl boasts one of the best screenplays of the decade, as well as some incredible casting choices.
",0.743,0.9986,2020-11-25 00:00:00,9,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)This is it. The last David Fincher's film I'll be able to review before Mank, his next masterpiece... I hope. I've been through Se7en, Fight Club, Zodiac, The Social Network, and now it's time for Fincher's latest installment, Gone Girl. Clearly, Fincher loves to work with people he knows. Jeff Cronenweth has been his director of photography in half of his movies, same for Kirk Baxter as part of the editing team, and Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross in the musical score. Even his production designer, Donald Graham Burt, has been around since Zodiac. However, Fincher always works with a different writer, and this time, he partners up with a debutant screenwriter, Gillian Flynn, author of the original novel that originates this adaptation.Usually, when it comes to writers, I take this change of media with a grain of salt since writing a book isn't exactly the same as writing a screenplay (it's completely different, I was being generous). With that said, Flynn absolutely destroys my self-doubts, delivering one of the best scripts of 2014. From the exceptionally captivating, perplexing disappearance of Amy to the underlying theme about how press and media treat this type of news, Flynn's screenplay is impressively able to develop each and every narrative in the most perfect way possible. With a remarkable use of time/date stamps, the viewer follows in a detailed manner the events that build up to the tragic day through different perspectives, mainly Amy's and Nick's.This story's greatest accomplishment is how it makes the press influence what the viewer thinks about the characters, just like in real life. Nowadays, people don't even click to read the full article and understand its context. A single headline, as far from the truth as it might be, is enough to start a worldwide online debate. The same goes for television networks, and their news shows: if it's on the national news program, then it must be true, people think. I may be wrong when I wrote the whole ""change of media"" matter before, but of this, I'm sure: take every news article you read with a grain of salt because most of the time, the full, true story isn't entirely revealed.This takes me to Ben Affleck (Justice League, The Way Back) and what I consider one of the best casting choices of the respective decade. In case you don't know, Affleck has been pursued throughout his whole life by journalists who try their hardest to expose his personal life, no matter how disrespectful it may turn out to be. Nick goes through the exact same obstacle. There's non-stop news about Amy, and it only becomes a matter of time until Nick starts being accused of being a terrible husband, and ultimately the obvious killer, even though the press can't find a single proof. Affleck doesn't even need to incorporate a new character since he has the necessary life experience to offer an utterly brilliant performance. Definitely, one of my favorite actors working today.Since I'm in the realm of performances, I might as well continue with Rosamund Pike (Radioactive). Her interpretation of Amy is almost the opposite of Affleck's, in the sense that the latter gives a seemingly simple yet powerful display, while Pike has a much more complex, layered role. She can be menacing and scary but also loving and kind. The puzzle surrounding her disappearance is mostly based on a perspective enigma, as the viewer is told the same story through different lenses throughout the first half of the film. Honestly, this is probably a career-best performance for Pike, who portrays a character of extremes, allowing her to demonstrate her jaw-dropping emotional range.Carrie Coon (Margo Dunne) is another actress I've grown to deeply enjoy watching, and she's terrific as Nick's sister. Her chemistry with Affleck is spot-on, and I sincerely hope that one day she becomes one of the most coveted actresses in Hollywood. Tyler Perry (Tanner Bolt) is also pretty great as Nick's lawyer, but Kim Dickens is even greater as Detective Rhonda Boney, who partially plays the same role as the viewer by trusting that what she sees and hears is undoubtedly the ultimate truth. Flynn's screenplay is packed with twists and turns, some of them more surprising than others, but the third act saves an unexpected, shocking turn of events, leading to a powerful ending that will leave most audiences speechless, myself included.Two minor issues. One of them, you probably have already figured it out since I left Neil Patrick Harris (Desi Collings) out of the cast compliments above. Harris is fine as the character he portrays, but I can't help but feel that he wasn't the right actor for the role. This is a classic Fincher movie: dark, somber, depressing, tragic, and with its own share of violence and blood. In fact, it possesses one of the most disgusting, disturbing uses of blood in a single scene I've ever seen. Harris is an excellent actor, but he stands out from the rest of the cast, and not in a positive way. Again, fine performance, just not the right role for him. The other problem is admittedly an irrelevant nitpick regarding a few details story-wise that stretch the believability of everything just a bit.Nevertheless, this is still a phenomenal film, and it's another evidence of David Fincher's masterful visual filmmaking. Once again, Fincher works with his known crew members to create a sumptuous look and feel. With seamless editing, a memorable score, and fantastic camera work, Gone Girl is technically magnificent, but it's Gillian Flynn's debut screenplay that steals the spotlight. Boasting jaw-dropping twists, including an utterly shocking third act and respective ending, Flynn's narrative is incredibly engaging due to its remarkable structure and puzzling mystery, never losing an inch of excitement or interest. Ben Affleck is one of the best casting choices of the decade by interpreting a man whose life is deeply affected by the press and media, which should never be fully trusted (a clear and powerful message to the audience), while Rosamund Pike delivers her career-best performance with an emotionally devastating display. Despite the misstep of casting Neil Patrick Harris in such a dark movie and a couple of nitpicks regarding the investigation, everything and everyone else turn this into one of the best films of the 2010s.Rating: A"

I have friends who talk like this and I get enough of them.The cast is gross. Ben, Rosamund, How I met your mother, Tyler Perry. I don't know what sort of debt Fincher got into where he had to work with these people.Switches genres (in a bad, amateurish way).They literally have a scene with cut-to-black trailer editing.Fincher has gotten too comfortable with the ""talk %10 faster"" style of directing which was appropriate for an Aaron Sorkin script but wears it's welcome here.If you're a woman who hates her glib city husband, by all means enjoy this movie! But keep in mind that these are horrible role models for anyone to act as.Edit: it's funny reading the reviews that say ""this ruined my marriage!"" I could totally see that XD. This is a totally subversive film that devilishly whispers into the ears of unsatisfied spouses to tear their relationships apart. It was probably designed by a team of psychologists. Do we really need any more media tearing marriages apart? We all know divorces that could have been avoided and we all know people who read books like these.I suppose people want an excuse to hate the people around them and films like these give them the perfect fantasies and paranoias to justify doing so."

What the hell is this dude's logic. His girlfriend nearly puts him away for life and by the end of the movie there back together!? I never understand how everyone loves the ending!?? It makes no sense at all.2. The diary
It's a cheap way of storytelling.
Whenever there's something that needs a explanation we will give a flashback with the main character writing in her diary. This gives us explanations on what's happening.
This is a sign that the writing is terrible and to be honest it definitely is.3. 1 hour and a half to long
This movie finished like 3 times. Whenever I thought this movie was heading to a conclusion we would keep going. It going annoying and tedious. For a movie where not a lot happens it shouldn't be 2 and half hour long. Especially with the attempt to be Tarantino with the extra long dialogue which was set to fail from the get go with the horrible writing

" Could have been great but nope....
",0.3716,0.9881,2020-10-31 00:00:00,3,"I love David Fincher as a director and so I saw this film 2 years ago, hearing great things about it. Side-Note: I actually read the book the movie was based on but instead decided to judge it as a film.Honestly? It was just disappointing the first time I watched it and I bowed out in the first half. A couple of years later, I was thinking about it and thinking I might have been treating it too harshly, I decided to watch it again with a blank slate and the result? Not only did my opinion not change, I actually ended up disliking it even more the second time.I had actually read the book prior to the movie so right from the get-go, I knew what was gonna happen. The problem (or one of the problems that is) is that the characters had no depth in the film. They did have depth in the book but that being said, it's a novel so Gillian Flynn could get away with writing the backstory for some of the characters and their inner thoughts. Here, the characters just felt rushed and shallow compared to the novel. The story even feels like it's been stripped down and not in a good way.The performances are a mixed bag to be honest. Ben Affleck, right off the bat, was honestly miscast in my opinion. His performance felt like he had no personality whatsoever, I couldn't care for him at all, and it sounded like he was bored throughout the entire film. Rosemund Pike was luckily a better casting choice, as she felt creepy throughout the film with her monotone voice and performance which could be likened to Anton Chigurrh. Sadly, the only flaws with her character come from the writing but Pike did the best with what she was given.The cinematography (which I usually love in David Fincher's movies) felt bland compared to his other work. The composition was good, but the colour grading was a bit bland, not to mention that it looked the same as the many flashbacks that took place throughout the film.The editing (which I usually love as well in Fincher's work) is pretty good for the most part but where it falters is the flashback sequences; some are great which the rest feel poorly timed and it felt like they could have done it in a more creative way.To conclude, I like Fincher's work and this film does have some redeeming qualities. But overall, this is unfortunately his worst movie as a director in my opinion."

Its well explained so it doesnt feel like there are any holes in the logic, but its certainly convenient. I dont know anything about it, but its almost as if the story is too perfect, maybe because it was a book and they didnt have enough time? Though 2,5 hours felt 1,5 hours more than i wished it was in this genre.Probably a good movie, i just didnt like it. Good acting though. Reminded me of the time i used watching STALKER or whatever the russian movie is named, just felt like i was wasting my time.

" Sickening But Compulsive
",-0.296,-0.9856,2020-10-15 00:00:00,8,"This review is going into a large traffic of reviews so my humble offering will probably go unread. As a writer who has a smallish following of readers I am used to this, and this is why I prefer to give non mainstream films preference, which includes a large amount of semi-ignored LGBTQ film, older films that have sadly passed over the horizon of time or quirky shorts that get lost in the forest of what we call film. This film I did not even know was directed by David Fincher until I found a slimline copy of it somehow lost in my collection. I hate the title. It is a come and grab me title and I do not want to be grabbed. A lot of Fincher's work have similar pushy approaches; ' Seven ', ' Panic Room ', ' The Social Network ,' and of course ' Fight Club '. The latter has for me an overtly Gay feel about it , and the content of that scenario can easily have a Gay interpretation. And now ' Gone Girl ' which seems the darkest, most pessimistic of the lot. The message I took away from it was that we can trust no one or know what twists of perversion and horror they are going to inflict upon us; neither should we trust our own for hell is truly within and can destroy our sanity in the process of destroying others. I noticed too that one reviewer had said it had propelled his own marriage to a divorce. I believed him and this appals me, but such is the strength and power of Fincher's best work, and this is an excellent film. But do I like it ? No. There is a murder scene that is sickening to watch and after the film's semi-long running time I felt numb. Fincher has a vision of darkness and often claustrophobic savagery and he convincingly draws you in. During watching ' Panic Room ' in an Amsterdam Cinema a large rat literally ran over my body in the darkness. I took that as a sign that Fincher is dangerous, but then quite a few of our best directors (usually of the past ) are. But to return to ' Gone Girl ' it twists like a snake, and even dead wood Ben Affleck gave a superb performance, but it is Rosamond Pike's extraordinary acting that sucked me into the whirlpool. To sum up - see it at your peril, and see it alone for it is ultimately about aloneness and what the world conveniently calls evil. It is a vision too terrible to share with anybody or be responsible for them to see it."

",0.533,-0.8801,2020-10-14 00:00:00,5,"That's pretty much what 99% of movie buffs will wonder when they see the meta score on imdb for this thriller. It's actually decent, maybe even good?Well, it really depends on where you're coming from - if you're a finsher fan, and you were expecting something on par with the amazing, genre-busting fight club, I have bad news: this is a well constructed thriller but nothing special. A particularly long VO exposition sequence mid-movie seriously ruins this film chances at greatness.On the plus side, if you need something to keep yourself distracted on a rainy saturday, this isn't bad at all.The problem really is that the characters are paper thin, especially the wife, and I'm told that this is a major shift away from the complexity and subtlety of the book it's adapted from. Everything that happens in the movie is telegraphed 15 minutes ahead. Everything.Some have said the movie is a critique of feminism - nonsense. The movie is a critique of media circuses and mob mentality. But while it maintains a nice balance in the form of Afflek's character flaws, it doesn't offer the same when it comes to his wife.Performances are fairly subpar by the way - at some point one character jokes they feel like in a 'law and order' episode and well, not sure if it was intended to be so meta , but it hits the nail right on the head."

""Gone Girl"" is perhaps David Fincher's best movie yet. And amongst movies like ""The Game"" and ""Seven"" that's saying a lot.
I don't know what exactly I enjoyed so much that makes me say something like that. But between a great deal of suspense, some good twists, a thought provoking plot and some good acting, this movie is definitely an entertaining ride.
Yet I do have to criticize the unnecessary amount of R rated content.With her performance as Amy Dunne, Rosamund Pike took ""villain"" to a whole new level. I don't remember the last time I've despised a character so much.
Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne kindled inside me an amount of sympathy equal to the amount of hatred Amy did. I know he wasn't as innocent as let on but nonetheless he certainly didn't deserve the ordeal he went through.
I also found Carrie Coon's character Margo to be very interesting and attractive.The plot was also good. Flawed, but good. I'm still pondering upon the journey this movie takes us on and the slightly underwhelming but thought arousing ending it reaches.Overall I don't know if I would recommend this movie as it is rather disturbing, upsetting and inappropriate but it's probably worth a shot for UNMARRIED mystery fans."
" A well crafted, authentic adaptation of a fun, twisting thriller
",0.7003,0.9979,2020-09-01 00:00:00,8,"Gone Girl is one of the more authentic adaptations I've seen, along with Silence of the Lambs. Both make small changes to better suit the film medium but capture the all key plot points and more importantly, the tone and intention of the novel. The plot is pulpy and nothing exceptional in Gone Girl, but the way the story unfolds and the details you learn about the characters still makes it quite satisfying. The book is great for all the small details that make the characters feel so realistic and that you can understand their psychology, and the movie here does a fantastic job of translating those nuances into the characters and tone via strong performances and excellent direction from Fincher. Pike is a standout and scene stealer, and the movie truly rests on her ability to effectively convey Amy's psychology. She's fantastic - if anything, I wish Fincher had spent more time with her and given more details about her mindset, especially how she really felt early in the marriage, but it still works as her presence is rarely on screen but often felt. The third act in the movie did seem to sacrifice a bit of the psychological delving that I love most about the movie in favor of hitting the plot points and twists efficiently, but even then it's all so well crafted (especially the one bloody scene in the movie) that I was engaged the whole time. Very well done, great watch if you haven't read the book but also really satisfying as it captures the essence of the book and translates it to the screen seamlessly."

There are many twists in this tale which begins with a seemingly near perfect marriage. The image changes when his wife goes missing under mysterious circumstances.
Ben Affleck plays the distraught husband of a missing wife but soon falls under suspicion. I don't want to elaborate on the plot any further as it would be a story spoiler.
The movie keeps its audience glued as it unfolds with many twists along the path to the final conclusion.
The acting is superb along with an enticing script and a very interesting story.Ben Affleck is one of the most under-rated actors of our time. He did well to accept this part and played the role to perfection."

But then you realize the woman is bat-crap crazy, so what should the Ben Affleck character do? He is so wishy-washy that he probably gets what he deserves, doomed to living with a homicidal maniac. As entertainment, the film tried to maintain suspense but that vanished once the wife's role in the ""disappearance"" was revealed. Like the sexually-repressed girl in Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion,"" you know she has problems (in ""Repulsion"" the girl's problem - which led to gruesome consequences-was androphobia, an abnormal fear of interaction with men). You hope ""Gone Girl"" will end with the woman being taken away to a mental institution and when it doesn't you feel disappointed--but then that's how the author wrote the story. Another film along this line is ""Les Diaboliques"" where two women conspire to murder an emotionally abusive man only to discover that his body has disappeared and there are reports of him being seen alive here and there. The ending is a surprise, but unlike ""Gone Girl"" the key to the mystery isn't given away so soon, hence that movie qualifies as a classic ""Thriller"" while ""Gone Girl"" is just fodder for psychology classes."

The story here is predictable and trite but nevertheless the telling is enormous fun! It's not easy to keep humour and drama going at the sam time. I'm not usually a fan of Fincher as his plot lines are often ludicrous.

",0.25,0.9521,2020-08-07 00:00:00,7,Overall I really enjoyed this. The filmmaking and performances are great however the story falters a bit in the third act.That slow stripping back of Affleck's character while he struggled with the media (seeing how he navigates that landscape and the effect it has on those around him) was handled so well and them sections of the movie are really up there. The film does a really good job of looking at the magnifying effect of the media and exploring how the management of image can become more important than the issue to which it's tied to. I actually even really liked the 'reveal' as well as where the story initially started to go afterwards.SPOILER TALKWhere the film lost me however was the Neil Patrick Harris character and with him I feel the film kinda descended into stereotypical thriller garble and dragged the Amy character down with him. There was an absurdism to it all that didn't jar with the clinical style of the film up to that point. Everything to do with her imprisonment/escape/return/blackmail etc. made me roll my eyes into the back of my headSPOILER TALK

Growing up, Amy was aloof and unsociable from living in Amazing Amy's shadow, but Nick's charming personality and wit shows her what happiness really looks like. Slowly their marriage collapsed in over five years tension, disappointment, anger and even physical abuse arose. Amy now feels that Nick has taken her time, money, heart, and altered forever the course of her life, only to begin an affair with his student.
His punishment should fit the crime of murder?The only person more dangerous than a psychopath is an intelligent one, Amy with her genius was ready to harm herself in order to drive her vengeance. With perfect planning and execution her twitched head was obsessed to destroy her husband. Its amazing how the brains of a psychopath functions, its nearly irrevocable. Amy, wanted complete control over Nick and she didn't leave any stone unturned.Rosamund Pike's portrayal was probably the sexiest form of crazy and as gracefully she slit the throat of her ex boyfriend and wore his blood like fashion was beyond insanity. She wanted attention, she wanted control and more than that she wanted revenge. The intensity of her vindictiveness doesn't just impact Nick's life, though Amy's even willing to kill herself to ensure that justice, as she understands it, is served.The fact that audience could answer the question, ""who is most sympathetic in the film?"" in several different ways is in and of itself the masterstroke of the movie. It leaves you bamboozled as to how in the world can you feel yourself in the dilemma of picking sides, and I think that was the most beautiful aspect of it all. The psychopath did manage to play the antagonistic narrative so intellectually that blew our minds and set us all on a mystery ride."

" Another Overrated David Fincher thriller with flawed Climax..
",0.1027,-0.9787,2020-07-17 00:00:00,6,"Gone Girl (2014) :Another Overrated David Fincher thriller with flawed Climax. Certainly, another Good David Fincher flick which has more thrills throughout the narrative but ain't got one, not even small one in the climax. I would call it a brother of Se7en, another David Fincher film with disappointing Climax. Gone Girl is a story about a married couple, Nick and Amy who were once in love but now just living soulless married life. Amy sets up a plan to fake her death and put Nick behind the bars after finding out his affair with a teenage girl. Now, there are lot of contradictions in the writing as you can see a man cannot be found guilty unless the dead body is found and this very important thing is overlooked. Additionally, Amy doesn't have any future plans and then finds herself trapped and then kills a man to Come back and live with the fame she got after her disappearance. One more dull thing about the film is all the male characters in the film are so dumb that even after realising her plans they just don't learn anything, they just don't prepare for backup. And what was the role of detectives and cops in the film? Were they just trying to show us how brainless Missouri police is? Tell me Fincher, how come you decide to make a thriller with forceful and unnatural ending and end it up making no sense at all even after overdoing evilness. I mean come on there are good people around, there are good things happening all around and there are some smart people to understand an such ordinary set-up. Just forget it, i couldn't find any sense or real life connections here. Rosamund Pike is fantastic in the film, Ben Affleck is Good.

When the reality of domestic violence is that women are killed with a sickening frequency by their partners or ex-partners. Not that you can't have an evil, manipulative female character. But this is so over the top, so ridiculous that a woman can fake rape this way.
See Girl on a Train for an example of this genre. The viewpoint of the Emily Blunt character enables the viewer to understand her psychological reality, while still appreciating the damage she causes, and it has a genuine twist."

In my opinion, it can be said that ""The Lost Lover"" is not so obvious in comparison with other David Finch movies, but if the people and things that appeared in the previous David movie are us If it is difficult to contact, then marriage really needs a real reflection.
Marriage may not need to be given a definition, either as sweet as some Mary Su movies, or just facing each other. More is full of compromises. Marriage seems to be just for the reproduction of future generations. The society gives people an impression that we do n't know how fertility is so straightforward and violent. Maybe their story is still far away from you, but think about it, is it true that marriage has made you hypocritical and learned to disguise?
Perhaps the film is not as detailed as the book portrays, but the film does give some people who haven't been in contact with the original work a chance to reexamine the marriage. So what are you thinking?"

It stars Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Set in the Midwestern United States, the film's story begins as a mystery about a man, Nick Dunne (Affleck), whose wife, Amy (Pike), has gone missing, and depicts the ensuing events that arise. In Carthage, Mo., former New York-based writer Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his glamorous wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) present a portrait of a blissful marriage to the public. However,when Amy goes missing on the couple's fifth wedding anniversary, Nick becomes the prime suspect in her disappearance. The resulting police pressure and media frenzy cause the Dunnes' image of a happy union to crumble, leading to tantalizing questions about who Nick and Amy truly are."
" The distance between a cool girl and a gone girl is called marriage.
",0.3182,0.9998,2020-05-26 00:00:00,8,"Have read both novels and movies. Because of the relationship between the text, the novel is more in-depth in the excavation of characters. But in a limited space, the film also beautifully narrated a twists and turns story, layer by layer interlocking. As a film with twists and turns in the novel, some of the concepts are very interesting, especially the psychological description in the novel extends these concepts and raises many challenging questions about marriage and love.1, Cool GirlThere is a slight difference between Eastern and Western cultures, but in general, men like a creature called ""cool girl"". In addition to the basic hardware such as hot face Peugeot, Cool girl is such a creature. They can wear team uniforms to watch the ball game with boys, stuff pizza burgers in their mouths, but never worry about not wearing small clothes. They are smart, funny and humorous, and always have a big smile on their faces. They will not be jealous because their boyfriends talk to other girls and laugh, and they fully understand that men miss their appointments because of their buddies' parties. Cool girl won't nag, she knows when to be silent and should give her boyfriend his own space. She will not make unreasonable demands, nor will she interfere with each other.The man version corresponding to Cool girl is a precious variety called ""Prince Charming"", which is more common in various chicken movies and Korean dramas. Of course, in addition to the most basic equipment such as a tall figure and a white tooth, each of which reflects a gentle light, the white horse princes also have to observe the smallness of the heroines year-round like a 24-hour convenience store. Thoughts, other women's legs are longer than you, chest is bigger than you, face is bigger than you, they are all considered dung. He remembers every trivial or even the holiday anniversary outside Mars. The heroine saw a fish pond, a real estate, a small park or something. The heroine would overbearingly say, ""This piece of xx, I will contract for you (buy / Title)! ""What is Prince Charming? Do you think it's enough to send a designer bag? There must also be a matching wallet inside. Do you think a wallet is enough? Inside, you have to put in a variety of platinum VIP cards and enough cash!Regardless of whether Cool Girl and Prince Charming actually exist, at least many of us know how to perform mimicry and adapt to the jungle rules of gender relations. Just like Amy. The clever Amy saw Nick at first glance and knew that he liked ""Cool girl"", so like many other clever girls, she decided to enter the ""cool girl"" mode.2. Good love makes each other a better personThis is a sentence I have always believed before. But after watching ""gone girl"", I can't help but think, what if this better person is not you? What if you are just performing this better person and meeting the expectations of each other?
Just like the initial relationship between Amy and Nick, each of them is playing the role that the other person wants. Although they also get a lot of satisfaction and happiness from playing, deep down, they always know that it is not themselves. So when the mask of the play appeared cracked, and the true face under the mask appeared, their marriage was in trouble.
This is the essence of this book and this movie. When there is a gap between reality and expectation, where will marriage be based.Unemployed because of the financial crisis, tired Nick has no intention to cooperate with Amy's expectations, and Amy has decided to show his true personality because of Nick's decadence. The real she disgusted Nick. This is where Amy is really angry. He loves the ""cool girl"" she played, not her. This is a huge injury to her self-esteem.Her revenge is very interesting. At first she decided to frame him for murder, but halfway through, her mind changed. She found that she had inspired the Nick when she first met-no, or even better-which excites her and makes her feel that there is hope for the marriage between them to continue, as long as both of them return to their original Role-playing. Even Nick himself said after completing the touching interview, ""She brought out my best.""3. Unconditional loveUnconditional love, is this a wish that is too extravagant? Even Amy's own parents can't give her. For them, she is the prototype of Amazing Amy, the incomplete product that all failures need to make Amazing Amy complete. If we let our parents down, do they still love us? Is the same level of love? Have you even loved the part where we failed?Unconditional love. This is what Amy and all women like Amy expect from the other half. It is also what we think we can get from the family. But what kind of existence is it? Is it because of love, so love all the dark side of all your shortcomings together? Or because you love your strengths, can you tolerate your tolerable shortcomings? If it is the latter, if one day finds a flaw that is too large to contain, is love still there?Amy didn't get unconditional love from her parents, so she hopes to get it from the family she formed. In the book, she writes, shouldn't marriage love each other unconditionally? When she didn't get it, she decided to punish him.4. The bottom line of marriageThe ending is really sad. This is more sad than all life and death. It seems that the way to continue a marriage is that you have to wear a mask to perform.But the marriage in the world is really different, isn't it?Nick's sister doesn't understand why he can still live with such a terrible woman. She won't understand.
I remember chatting with my friends once and talking about the bottom line of marriage. I thought about it, there is no universal bottom line, the bottom line of marriage is the bottom line of each other. When you pay for a marriage, you pay for each other's bottom line.
From this point of view, Nick and Amy are a perfect match."

" marriage story
",0.0,0.9725,2020-05-21 00:00:00,8,"'Gone Girl', made in 2014 by David Fincher on a screenplay written by Gillian Flynn who adapted her own bestseller, is a winning combination: it is a very well written thriller with enough upheavals and perspective changes so that the two and a half hours of screening pass without you realizing it; it is a social drama that tells important and true things about life in a small town in the American Midwest and about the role of television and sensationalist talk shows in manipulating public opinion; and above all it is the drama of a marriage. If I had to choose an alternative title for the film, I think 'Marriage Story' would be very appropriate. Ultimately, everything that happens in this story that begins with the disappearance of a woman announced to the police by her husband, is the result of what happened in the five years of marriage that preceded the events, and which, as in Noah Baumbach's film will be described widely through flashbacks and excerpts of the diary written by the missing woman.I haven't read the book, so I can't appreciate how far the film moves away from the story in the book. I can say that the script is smartly written, in a way that keeps the viewer's attention constantly alert. It begins as a detective drama, with the disappearance of Amy (Rosamund Pike), a successful writer, and the investigation led by two local police officers. In a short time, her husband (Ben Affleck), also a writer, but less talented, and a college teacher becomes the main suspect, with 'help' from the press and television stations which rummage through the history of their marriage finding the cracks and less harmonious aspects inherent in almost any couple relationships. After a good hour of watching, the perspective changes by the finding of a diary that gives voice to the missing woman. The investigation turns into a murder investigation, and I will not reveal more to avoid committing the spoiler's sin. I will only say that the attention continues to be kept and the tension will increase towards an end, which is one of the possible but also debatable many endings, which will not make everyone happy.Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike play two of the best roles of their careers in this film. The atmosphere of the small town with its social differences, with the bar and the curious neighbors, with the public opinion influenced and changing their sympathies or hatred after the last talk show is excellently rendered, so are the portraits of the two well-meaning policemen and of the lawyer in search for cases with maximum publicity. The use of flashbacks together with the journal pages that trigger them gives a feeling of continuity to the story but also of permanent uncertainty about the credibility of the sources. As in any good thriller, viewers can't be sure about what they see on screen, whom they can trust, how much of what the heroes tell is true, and what they omit to say, intentionally or not. From this point of view, divorce proceedings and criminal investigations are similar, and 'Gone Girl' combines the two types of conflicts. A film that captivated me and that I recommend to those who have not seen it yet."
" Gone Love
",0.6369,0.8591,2020-05-21 00:00:00,7,"The two-line narrative is a narrative structure that crosses the narrative between the bright line and the dark line, the main line and the branch line. From this film, it can be seen that the male is the bright line, the female is the dark line, the time is the main line, and the diary is the branch line. The narrative structure breaks the previous single-line narrative structure. The shooting skills of the two lines are intertwined. On one side is the police officer 's investigation of Nick and Nick 's review of love. On the other hand, Amy 's diary records gradually lead people to Nick as a murderer. The murderer's facts, under the continuous emergence of evidence and clues, the audience constantly doubts and corroborates his judgment and reasoning about the entire missing event, the interweaving contrast between the main line and the branch line, the two clues support and contradict each other. This means that the audience must constantly overthrow their prior experience with the film, so as to establish another kind of reality in the process of viewing the film, to achieve the reconstruction of the event and the film, and ultimately judge the story's organization and morality. Let the audience truly integrate into the film while enjoying the film, conduct in-depth thinking and interaction, guide the audience to explore the truth, and give the story a unique tension. Here the narrator emphasizes not an independent plot or situation, but the relationship between different clues, different events, and different characters reflected in the lens or paragraph, and the story mostly shows an open ending. Reflects the function of double-line narrative and its full charm"

The shorts version I can tell you and with my hand to God no lie this movie single handedly put the nail in the coffin for my marriage without me even being the wiser. So for as much as I do appreciate the detailed and intriguing story, watching it years later after my divorce it sends chills through my body knowing that my ex wife and I enjoyed this movie together, and obviously me not knowing just how much she loved it but how it inspired her to go about divorcing me in the way that she did, be weary because there are sick people (men and women) in this world that will vindictively assassinate someone else's character and well being just to avenge whatever perversion that they're transfixed on in their own mind. I'm not looking for sympathy or anything, I'm just stating a fact that happened to me, I don't advise watching this for the first time with a love partner, it could unhinge the mind beyond a point of no return, I'm absolutely 100% serious about this, this is not a joke."

I have watched this countless times and it still blows my mind - Gone Girl takes the traditional murder mystery genre and turns it on it's head.
The perfect film to watch with your S/O ... (joke)
Darkly satirical and scintillating, Gone Girl forces us to look at the dark parts of ourselves, the validity of our relationships and societies propensity to pigeonhole women.Affleck and Pike were destined to be Nick & Amy. The alternate narratives weave nicely together, with just enough left unsaid to make you question both accounts. After watching the film you are left somewhat perplexed by how searingly honest it is. The film criticises our fascination with true crime and our naivety to believe the narrative the media spins. The film also touches on hyper realism, and the over arching need for people to present themselves as someone else in order to be liked/accepted (the cool girl speech/ the dancing monkey) - very timely in a social media obsessed culture."

This movie also makes an ironic ""roast"" to the media, by showing the dirts of the actions of the media, that many times (try to) choose a scapegoat just to divide people's thoughts and bring more audience.

Granted that the sight of Ben Affleck's silly face in any movie almost always sends me into peals of innocent laughter. But this time it wasn't just Ben's natural look of good-guy befuddlement. Nothing made sense and nothing felt real!Rosamund Pike has less talent to ooze menace on the screen than any beautiful actress I have ever seen. Every time she's aiming of mysterious and dangerous she comes across as hypnotized and robotic. And those are the good moments! Her performance is so poor that by the end of the picture they're reduced to soaking her in fake blood just so that they can get some kind of reaction -- any kind of reaction -- from an audience that checked out long ago. Watch a movie like LAURA (1944) starring Gene Tierney and you'll see how a beautiful actress can actually play enigmatic and mysterious without sacrificing wit, charm, credibility and humanity.This is the kind of movie where it's a waste of time to expect realism on any level, yet I have to say that the nasty lady detective had the worst, most grating southern accent I have ever heard. And that's even though the actual actress is from Alabama! Of course, the character's name is ""Boney."" So is that some sort of subtle hint that she's trying act like man? Or that she has a Napoleon complex?So as I said, I looked up the actress, and realized I'd seen her in Sons of Anarchy -- and boy, is she much better on that show. If only Jax and the Sons could have ""crashed"" this movie! I would pay huge, huge bucks to see what Chibs and Tig would do to Ben Affleck's character, you know, like in the shower.

" Amy Dunne is dark and passionate.
",0.5267,0.9846,2020-04-26 00:00:00,8,"Gone Girl is a thriller that has abundant flaws but also notorious qualities that eclipse any seemingly unforgiving flaws. Honestly, I truly enjoyed the movie despite the inconsistencies, plot holes, unaddressed events, absurd attitudes, etc. The movie does what a good thriller is supposed to do: keep you guessing from second one what is happening in the movie, present a complex situation in which the viewer has to evaluate the possibilities and discover along with the development of the movie twists and turns that keep the movie fresh.Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) delivers a masterful performance as the calculating and manipulating estranged wife that is obsessed in imparting punishment to her husband for his neglect and adulterous behavior. She is arrogant, spiteful, impassive, highly logical, a rational genius. We travel with her this regression from being a sensitive, intrigued, hopeful, and impassioned woman to becoming a calculating maniac and it is an artistic beauty to watch. Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) offers a performance that is maybe not up to par with Rosamund but adapts to the character well and gives a believable rendition. He showcases himself, despite her being the psychopath, as a dryer more taciturn and expressionless character than Amy. The fact that he does not show more emotion shackles his ability to aggrandize his performance to match Amy's.Gone girl's initial dialogue is some of the most interesting frolicking and astute banter that I have seen depicted in a movie in a long time. It is smart, quick witted, astute, perspicacious, works brilliantly at capturing your attention and demonstrates the stark chemistry between the two protagonists. It is the dialogue that I like to hear in interchanges between characters. The movie shows the viewer the position of privilege that both protagonists enjoy intellectually, which successively helps us believe the manipulating behavior that both are able to devise.Hey, I understand that the movie has ridiculous flaws in the plot, but the movie in my opinion presents us a proposition: Believe this story of two people that get ravaged, corrupted, disappointed by the effects of incompatibility in a relationship, and we will present you with one of the most unique stories of redemption, perseverance, and acceptance. Amy utters a dialogue that symbolizes the eidos of that couple: I have killed for you; who else can say that? You think you'd be happy with a nice Midwestern girl? No way, baby! I'm it."

One other HUGE one to appreciating the message of the film is that our ideas about relationships are pretty messed up. This was an allegory for people who stick in toxic relationships. It is a timeless message and particularly needed. Like Affleck suggested: Why do people choose to stay in something where they hurt And control one another instead of just accept that they are not right for one another???? Pressures-mostly EXTERNAL pressures! Judgements of friends, family, media, etc! Equating a failed relationship or marriage to have a loser and a winner-when they could easily both be winners if they don't set it up as a contest.This was the deeper underlying message. And I think it is silly that there are people underrating this film because of a few details. I think the message just hit a little too close for comfort for many.If you are in a relationship that is not one of full compatibility and consent-start making a peaceful and honest exit strategy.

Of course, the movie gives a very dark answer: sexual stimulation, money protection, and the child's consumption of time and energy.In this discussion, romantic love is more like the backward biological traits that humans have not adapted to the post-industrial society: people are forced to fall in love and conclude marriage contracts under the urge of erotic desire, but if marriage is regarded as a small organization, the existence of contract and its The restriction function is to unify the internal conception of the organization, so as to achieve the coordination of motivation and action, so that the organization can improve efficiency when participating in social activities, and continue itself more lastingly; and in the so-called Dink family, when the mating partner The erosion of lust can no longer produce fresh stimuli, but the understanding of life and the pursuit of career are different, and it is impossible to organize joint action. Then the marriage contract only has the framework function to maintain the existence of marriage. This makes some people think of it as a siege, or a prison, or a tomb, which conveys only one meaning: people can no longer see the significance of maintaining the status quo, but they have to maintain the status quo is limited by it, because there is no other choice."
" Great Movie
",0.6249,0.9716,2020-04-17 00:00:00,9,"It's insulting that this film was only nominated for a single academy award. Gone Girl is able to take the plot of its movie which is tragic as is and spiral it out of control to the point of no return for the characters. The performances were all fantastic and Rosamund Pike was very well deserving of her nomination for best actress. Sadly the reason this doesn't fall under the category of a Perfect Movie for me is because of Neil Patrick-Harris' performance, whenever he was on screen I was taken out of the movie a bit, he should stick to comedies. But overall Gone Girl is a fantastic movie that I'd recommend to anyone who appreciates a good film."

The clever screenplay will keep you wondering what will happen next until you witness twisting and shocking suspense.The acting is great by Ben Affleck but Rosamund pike steals the show from a pity 'oh my husband wanted to kill me' victim of domestic violence to a vicious, cunning and a brutal murderer who can even faked that she has been raped to earn enough hatred from the viewers. She was brilliant and terrific.One more important aspect that is highlighted in the movie is media judgement which is a sorry state of affairs in almost all the democratic countries where a suspect is already convicted by media even before the trails and eventually ruins their life, also put undue pressure on investigating officers.The screenplay is evenly paced and entertaining and keeps you guessing if you haven't read the book in fact I myself haven't read the book.One of the best mystery thriller movie to watch."

Putting on anything is justifiable and stern, and our instinct is not to admit that we have made a mistake, and then resolutely rammed into a road without retreating. A lover should be a creature who understands each other, and those who should be separated by understanding must eventually carry a greater burden.
This is not only a crime of high IQ, but also a crime of high EQ. The mistress's grasp of human nature is meticulous, and it will make you afraid of marriage after reading it. Appreciating this simple and decisive operation, as well as the mutated but perverted human nature, seems to be a more perfect parasitic in this deformed society where public opinion is paramount."

" Gone Girl: Covering a Public Secret
",0.0,-0.9981,2020-04-04 00:00:00,4,"First time I watched Gone Girl, I was like, Wow! What a mystery! Performances, drama, the screenplay... all perfectly put together. (SPOILERS AHEAD)We've sure seen plenty of male psychopaths, serial killers, pedophiles and rapists (inspired by real life characters). But here's this pretty woman, petite, a successful author, a celebrity of sorts! Who could imagine her to be a serial killer? Killer of boy friends and partners. And she has many methods of killing up her sleeve, apart from knifing.I watched it a second time yesterday, after a gap of probably 3 years. Something struck me while watching Gone Girl this time. A strong underlying narrative was palpable. A narrative that was very familiar to me, personally familiar. That which is created to cover up a public secret.In the words of Michael Taussig, a Public Secret is that which is generally known, but cannot be articulated...not being able to say anything is like testimony to its power.That women are not believed or trusted when they report domestic violence, sexual assault or rape, is a public secret. As opposed to this, the popular narrative seeks to project women as liars, indulging in scheming and cheating, who would not desist from assaulting themselves for framing someone (usually completely innocent) out of lust, jealousy, greed or vengeance.That's precisely the perception created by the film.The female protagonist's character has been modelled on that of a psychopathic paranoid criminal personality (someone in need of psychiatric treatment).However, instead of projecting her as such, she is projected as an intelligent and successful modern woman loved and admired by one and all. She is, yet she is not the psychopath who would go to jail in the end. She is one of many. She is one of us.Surely she is a split personality. As opposed to the charismatic public persona of hers, her private persona is made of secrets, lies and crime. She's over-ambitious, manipulative and very cleverly abuses the laws meant to protect women. Completely black, no shades of grey.In the first half, she is a role model for all women of her age and time and in the second half she is a woman who has falsely and wrongly trapped at least 3 men, including her husband; she has framed them in serious criminal offences with meticulous planning and flawless execution. Though most of these offences are committed by her herself, including murder. She gets the better of everyone, the police, lawyer, media, neighbours, her parents, the boyfriends and her husband. No one's a match for her criminal mind.What do you get when you put these two sides of her personality together? That women who are intelligent, smart and successful are capable of feigning being raped and assaulted and will do so if dissatisfied with their husbands or partners, for any reason. Beware ! Watch out for these women ! In parties, at workplace, anywhere and everywhere.The husband, on the other hand, is a charming, good looking, handsome guy, who makes some mistakes, acknowledges them and apologises for the same. To become likeable again, from the most hated man in the country. He's been deceived and trapped by his own wife. He's neither all black, nor all white. He's human, he's normal.The last boyfriend before her marriage is another innocent guy who's only fault was that he wanted to step back a little. He's prosecuted for rape, pleads guilty and is serving his time. He cannot get a decent accommodation or job because he's listed on the sex offenders register. All this when the sex was completely consensual, in fact she was the one who was desperate for it.The boyfriend from school guy, is so gullible, that he gets trapped twice and pays with his life the second time.Well ! By this time my head is full of all the rape investigations and court trials I've witnessed or read the files or books about. Where the typical story is acquittal, because the raped woman was lying, cheating, concocting stories and creating all those injuries and false documents. It was like Amy just got out of a court file and enacted the courtroom version of her in the film, along with all the other characters.Was Amy's story told from Amy's perspective? Or did Amy find herself under a Male Gaze ?As audience, would we able to discern the standpoint of Amy or would that remain a public secret ? Would the audience know what not to know ? Even if they do, would they be obliged to act and think as if they don't know what cannot be known ?"

",0.0,0.9937,2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"So, the Academy award nominated movie Gone Girl was adapted from 2012 novel with the same name. This movie is about a husband whose wife goes missing. And now, rumors are going on everywhere about what happened to this girl? Where is she now? Is she a victim of some kind of abduction? Is Affleck involved in this whole thing somehow? This is without a doubt one of Ben Affleck's best performances ever. He is so perfectly fits in this role. Rosamund Pike is also excellent in this movie.
As the movie progressed, it continuously got darker and darker. It really makes you think differently about the way we view the media, about the way we view the news and about the way we make our own judgment afterwards without even knowing anything about them at all. That's something this movie shows so well; about how the news and the media can affect a situation. What I love about this movie is that there are so many hidden dark secrets of both the main characters. The story is very dark and also very rude. The various twists and turns in the movie come in a very perfect and natural way. That is a great screenplay done by Gillian Flynn. Tyler Perry was also great in this film. Neil Patrick Harris is just about okay in his role. All in all this is a flawless, well made movie, dramatically powerful and wonderfully directed."

" Makes me scared of getting married
",-0.4404,-0.4254,2020-03-19 00:00:00,9,"David Fincher's immersive and intimate direction has enabled Affleck and Pike to create a truly terrifying depiction of how humans will alter their own personalities to get what they truly desire from a relationship.
Affleck's excellent performance really takes the audience on his emotional journey to hell and back, and his interactions with all of the supporting characters feel incredibly genuine, and exactly how anyone would react should they go through the same emotional trauma that he does. However, the true star of the show is Rosamund Pike. She is able to portray so much escalating hate over the course of the first half of the film, and her cunning personality really shines as she is able to manipulate those around in order to fit her ever adjusting motives as the landscape around her continues to alter in different ways.
All in all, the direction, acting and cinematography all come together in such a way that conveys a message of hate and how far someone will go to make the person who has hurt them the most suffer even more than they have. The film ends in such a crushing way it gifts the audience a new perspective on their current morality.
David Fincher continues to solidify himself as one of the undisputed best director of modern times."

The movie is 2h30 long but the narrative is so good and entertaining that it feels like it wasn't that loong. Finchers directing is brilliant and the visual experience is also great, this factor allied to this intense plot make this an unforgettable experience. First time I saw this was in the year that the movie was released and I just rewatched today and it feels like it got even better.
About the movie itself I loved that the inicial scene was also the final scene. I also learned that to a lot of people that ending may seem disappointing but I completely loved it and honestly think that was the most appropriate taking in consideration the whole story. I also think that the baby wasn't the only reason that made Nick stay, my interpretation is that they are both kinda obsessed with each other but in different ways being the Amy way more extreme due to her probably being a sociopath or psychopath. But Nick can't leave her and this was pretty clear when his sister said that he wanted to stay and he kept quiet. They have a different and toxic type of love but at the end I really believe that they do love and are obsessed with each other.
Forever one of my favorite movies!"

",-0.5106,0.9575,2020-03-01 00:00:00,8,"Gone Girl compared to the rest of thrillers created by the hand of David Fincher, is an uneven comparison, Gone Girl as the story progresses does not have the same captivating rhythm of Fincher films and revelations throughout history are not as consistent and surprising as its other thrillers that are made up of amazing revelations after revelation.The story really is not so difficult to follow or understand, it is not a story so twisted to have to see several times to understand if you are attentive, as is the case with Fight Club.Some internal logical failures of the script make the movie lose a bit of strength and emotion, however here are all the resources used by Fincher in his other films and that is why I like it so much, the atmosphere of the film is mostly uncomfortable, dark and captivating, like every good Fincher movie has a unique style full of neo noir cinema inspirations, such as Brian dePalma, Paul Verhoveen and the most obvious Alfred Hitchcock.The climax of the film is the most unsatisfactory of the thrillers that David Fincher has made, constantly the endings of his film are surprising and suffocating, although the end of Gone Girl works, it extends so much that it seems stupid and loses strength, the last 10 minutes of the movie are an explanation of everything that has made us understand the movie, it's as if at the end of Fight Club they had interviews with Marla and The Narrator.Gone Girl is suffocating most of the time, intelligent both to develop her story and to give a different and uncomfortable portrait of marriage, the best thing about this movie is that there is no hero, all the characters here are morally wrong, an essential characteristic of the thrillers."

(R)When his ""amazing"" wife (Pike) disappears, aloof husband Affleck is suspected of murder, unleashing a media firestorm that captivates the community and nation at large, but truly not all is what it seems. Ice cold yet blistered in scorch marks, director Fincher does what he does best: an elegantly stylish, meticulously-crafted thriller that looks phenomenal, frame after frame, serving every dark impulse and lunatic intent, paired well with an unnerving score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross that provides false reassurance. Gillian Flynn's adaptation of her own best-seller is a hysterical dark comedy, serpentine mystery, trashy potboiler, and sinister study of sociopathy all rolled into one; can't withstand much scrutiny, but many of those plot holes (particularly toward the end) actually serve the satirical calculations of its macabre delight. Every role is perfectly cast (yes, even Perry), with Affleck and Pike delivering exactly what's needed for their unforgettable lead roles, so very deserving of each other despite not belonging within 500 yards of one another--to be a fly on the wall... Calmly torpedoes any politically correct notion of misogyny, misandry, militant feminism, revenge fantasy, etc., but is still bound to upset those who demand rectitude in their lurid fiction, which makes it all the more ingeniously unsettling.89/100"

",-0.7003,0.7543,2020-01-26 00:00:00,3,"Accomplished acting from Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike initially mask the problems with the plot of this film. At first, you might actually take these issues for plot twists rather than plot holes. Not until the last twenty minutes or so of the 2½ hour movie does everything really start to unravel. Perhaps it's a plan to lead us to what someone felt was a particular unsettling conclusion.But the result is a final five minutes that is deeply unsatisfying.The actions and motivations of some of the lead characters seem to be suddenly turned on their heads. It just makes no sense. But by then, over two hours of your valuable time has been invested.I've avoided spoilers and not detailed the plot holes here, but honestly, I think you might be better advised to go in with your eyes open to avoid disappointment. You could, for instance, read a pretty full list of the inconsistencies in the review here by banana-83.If you choose to watch the film at all, watch it for the acting. 3/10."

All David Fincher, made before he got the chance to make Alien 3. We'll forgive him that - and the fact that he had to work on Jermaine Stewart's video for ""We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off.""After all, you kind of have to like a guy who has said, ""I think people are perverts. I've maintained that. That's the foundation of my career.""Between Zodiac, Seven, Fight Club and The Social Network, most of Fincher's work is the kind of stuff that ends up on a poster in dorm rooms. That's not a bad thing - he's the dark side of popular film. He's also behind the Netfilx show Mindhunter.The real issue I have with him is Gone Girl.It's not his fault.I've had to endure Gillian Flynn's work in all manner of media. Sharp Objects ran our TV for most of 2018. And Gone Girl? This movie gets played in our house at least once a week.I hated this movie the first time I saw it. And by now, my reaction is the kind of numb ennui that a naked Ben Affleck feels just before you marvel that this movie is brave enough to share a shot of his meat.Mr. Affleck and his appendage appear in the movie as writing teacher Nick Dunne, whose wife - the inspiration for a popular series of children's books called Amazing Amy - has gone missing on their fifth anniversary. All signs point to the fact that he was an abusive husband and had her killed.The reason for that conclusion is that he doesn't seem to care. Perhaps if you had lived with Amy (Rosamund Pike), you may feel the same way. Sure, it started off hooking up at a party and were soon engaged, but after they both lost their jobs and moved to Missouri, Nick got lazy and started cheating on Amy (with Emily Ratajkowski, she of the nudity in the ""Blurred Lines"" video).The twist is that Amy is still alive and has framed Nick for murder. She's planned each step so well, stealing urine from a pregnant neighbor, using her blood to create evidence that she was hurt and then planting a diary and a multitude of purchases that look like things Nick had bought for himself. Of course, she didn't expect some backward yokels to steal her money or that she'd have to hook up with her old stalker, played by Neil Patrick Harris.So who is wrong? Nick for giving up on their marriage? Or Amy for the things she'd done to so many men in the past? How about both of them? How about some sympathy for me having to watch this movie nearly two thousand times?But hey - Tyler Perry is pretty good in it, right?Also: David Fincher shot 500 hundred hours of footage for this movie. 500 hours. Just imagine that."

The first hour was enjoyable, interesting story, good acting, endless possibilities. The second hour even better, amazing twist, even more possibilities! However.... the last ten minutes destroyed all hope for this to be the great film we anticipated based on reviews we have read over the years. A terribly unrealistic, unsatisfying ending brought this almost great movie from a 9/10 rating to the 6/10 you see before you. Not to dwell but the ending was so disappointing that it reminded me of an old low budget horror movie from the 80s that leaves an opening at the end for a sequel that would end up even more underwhelming than the original. I am not recommending that anyone skip this movie, just cut it off around the 2 hr 20 min mark and make up your own ending. ANYTHING would be better than the ending that played out.

" A MUST WATCH !!
",0.0,0.9499,2019-10-27 00:00:00,9,"Acclaimed director David Fincher presents a tense thriller adapted from Gillian Flynn's (screenplay is by Flynn herself) best selling novel of the same name - the story of a marriage gone bad... bad... BAD... a super-twisted & knotty BAD !! This movie explores the vulnerabilities, helplessness, frustration and the sheer desperation of being tied down in a doomed marriage.Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) are writers who have lost their jobs in the recession and are forced to relocate from New York to small town Missouri on account of Nick's mother who is diagnosed with fatal cancer and Nick's new job as a teacher in a local college. On the day of their fifth marriage anniversary, Nick, on returning home, finds Amy missing. There are also signs of struggle. Nick alerts the cops who begin an investigation that is bathed in the spotlights of a 24*7 news media melee, given the fact that Amy was a minor celebrity. As the hunt for a missing person transmutes into a murder investigation, skeletons start tumbling out of what was once considered a ""forever after"" fairy tale marriage and the needle of suspicion, slowly, but surely, turns towards Nick.What are the problems that caused these die-hard, hot-for-each-other romantics to fall out ? And, how bad is the fall-out ? Is it so frustrating and are they so desperate to kill for it ? The movie narrates all this and more in a plot that presents one twist after another which leads the viewer to believe one way only to trump them in the very next scene in deceit with their feelings oscillating between Nick and Amy with each unravelling of the knots. I refrain from detailing any further of the story which would be providing spoilers that would spoil the viewer's experience.Marriage is HARD WORK. It is a continuing exercise in mutual understanding which sustains and nurtures the seeds of mutual attraction which are supposed to sprout into an everlasting and deepening bond with strong roots. A continuing work in progress to build and reinforce compatibility through mutual care, trust and most importantly, communication. But, many, if not most, marriages trap the couple as hapless prisoners in an humdrum existence constructed on the ashes of their hyper-expectant beginnings that are divorced from their real selves. While one may never know the veracity of the adage of marriages being forged in heaven, there are more than ample proofs that once the frills & thrills of initial courtship fade off, deficits in mutual compatibility and communication could well render the marriage as a living hell with no escape.Nick & Amy Elliott Dunne traverse the entire spectrum of a marriage from its blissful beginnings to banal existence and onto fatal desperation in all of five years. While the rifts start appearing when the reality of depression, retrenchments and financial issues start to bite in, are they the cause or merely symptoms of some deeper fissures ? Despite seven years - two years of courtship and five years of being married - of knowing each other, how well do they know and understand each other ? What and how deep are their feelings for each other ? Do they know each other at all ? Or, are they just familiar with the exterior personality that each wants to present the other ?David Fincher has crafted a nail biting non-linear thriller which while being centered on an intriguing whodunit murder mystery also transcends the genre to explore the murky waters of modern marriages as well as that maddening phenomenon of our days called 24*7 news media. He pries open the Nick & Amy's layer by lifeless layer to pull out the diseased underside hiding behind the picture perfect exteriors. He also presents a commentary on the all pervasive sensation hungry news media which thrives on tabloid-isation of any news with scant regard to issues of privacy or even decency. News anchors - a la Arnab - preside over daily news shows which are stage managed kangaroo courts dishing out near vigilante justice based on insinuations and innuendos.Fincher's masterly skills are in crafting a film that strikes a fine balance in blending a first rate thriller with a nuanced study on the growing morass of modern marriages which are staged on flimsy foundations which end up spawning disenchanted couples and a growing number of divorces and dysfunctional families, societal hypocrisy, sensation seeking news media and an industry of attorneys who survive on familial discord. In examining the life of Nick & Amy, Fincher holds a mirror to our own relationships forcing the views to reflect upon them.
Ben Affleck is absolutely stunning as Nick Dunne, sporting a role with several shades of grey which requires him to be a consummate romantic to completely outwitted husband caught in the quagmire. But, it is Rosamund Pike who aces the tricky role of ""Amazing"" Amy showcasing with equal ease, romance, charisma, glamour and chilling malice. She is chameleon like in moving from being vulnerable to venomous to calculating to crowd pleasing to much more effortlessly. She is sure to earn several Best Actress nominations for this titular role and may also win a few. The spot-on supporting cast consisting of Neil Patrick Harris as a creepy jilted ex stalking Amy, Tyler Perry as an attorney specialising in defending husbands accused of murdering their wife, Carrie Coon as Nick's twin sister who is only support and Kim Dickens as the homicide detective are effective. The background score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross provides an accentuating texture to the proceedings.A slick, superlative and layered thriller that is a disturbing, yet, edge-of-the-seat entertainer that gets under your skin and makes you squirm. The following lines that open and close the movie are likely to resonate within the viewer long after they have finished watched it.""What are you thinking? What are you feeling?
What have we done to each other? What will we do?"""
" Disgusting great movie
",0.1779,0.3011,2019-10-27 00:00:00,9,"The acting is superb (especially from Rosamund Pike), the story awesome and twisted and thrilling, and the dialogue, while not that realistic, it is quite beautiful. Poetic? Maybe. I love it. Also, the characters are really complex. I was engaged by all their stories and lives.But, I was disgusted by how they approached this story. It reverses the reality and turns our sympathy towards the other side, begging us to understand how unfair this stories usually go in real life. And that's just perverse, knowing (as the creators all should) how big the problem really is, how difficult is to fight back to make it better, and how rare is the occasion were the problem wasn't more than an scam/lie from one side to victimize itself.But even in disgust, I can't deny how good the movie was."

" Comes close to the book's brilliance--and that's a big compliment.
",0.4767,0.9807,2019-10-06 00:00:00,9,"They were never going to pull off the *exact* same feeling and depth of the book, as many narrative devices used in the book are impossible to translate to film. What David Fincher and Gillian Flynn came up with, however, is a close second.The story of Nick and Amy Dunne could not have found a better director or cast. Then they had Gillian Flynn, the original author, pen the screenplay. Boom. Yes. That's how it needed to be done. All aces so far.Much of the plot's aspects and details were included, even if they are rearranged and adjusted for the film's benefit. The most satisfying survivor of the transition is the now infamous Cool Girl speech played over THE pivotal moment in the story--possibly the part in the film that gets the closest to the thrill of the novel.Where there thematic arguments, points, and plot developments missing? Of course. Did I miss them? Of course. There were a couple of huge things missing that changes the DNA of the story a little too much, rendering it less gut-punching than the book. I'd tell you what they are, but in the world of Gone Girl almost *everything* is a spoiler.A vital element of the book is just how relentlessly thorough it is--the narrative doesn't stop until every single point is made with brutal accuracy. So in contrast, a movie version will inevitably feel truncated, or like a ""best of"" montage. That's why I HIGHLY RECOMMEND reading the book first, waiting a few weeks, and then watching the movie. That will be the most satisfying way to experience this insane, razor-sharp story.Ultimately, this should have been a mini-series. But what they managed in a 2 1/2 hour film was remarkable."

How, and tell me how did this woman not win the Oscar for how she was able to outsmart everyone. This has to be some of David Fincher's best directorial choices since Seven, I totally second guessed myself with its many jaw-dropping twists. Not to spoil, but they do nearly reflect modern society's take on being morally ambiguous. This film is a true work of art and gives me hope for other great ones like it for years to come."
" Better Than Average Mystery - Gone Girl
",0.4404,-0.0867,2019-09-16 00:00:00,6,"Rosemund Pike gives a Joan Crawford-type performance in this mystery thriller also starring Ben Affleck. But make no mistake; Pike steals the film away from Affleck with the greatest of ease. Although not in the same category as Meryl Streep as an actress (she just does not have the sincere believability that Streep has). Pike is a formidable actress. She is good-looking (better looking than Crawford or Streep), sexier than Crawford or Streep, but not as genuine or believable as Crawford or Streep. Crawford was a great actress purely based on her iron will which was clearly present on her screen persona; Pike has that commodity in common with Crawford. Crawford and Pike are both chilling and threatening; Streep is not. We as an audience believe that Streep is vulnerable, but would scoff at the idea that either Crawford or Pike had even the remotest chance of being vulnerable. And that is what separates Pike from other actresses of this era. She is incapable of being vulnerable. No one would believe for a second that she could be vulnerable. It would be like being asked to believe John Wayne in a lead role of a gay-oriented film is vulnerable. I've seen all of Pike's films and am continuously fascinated with her persona, even though she gives exactly the same performance time after time.(just like John Wayne). And ultimately, she is a very bankable star."

",0.0,0.9894,2019-09-11 00:00:00,7,"For all those that look at Ben Affleck and still see him in the red spandex from Daredevil or detect the stench of Gigli lingering on him, give this one a try.The plot in this is pretty straight forward and if you can overlook some of the conveniences that almost always accompany a film like this then you're in for a solid suspense piece. But even if none of that works for you, the message this film has about our tendency to shoot first and ask questions later when it comes to character assassination is as relevant now as it's ever been.How about great acting? Affleck is stupendous. His ability to demonstrate a range of emotions while sprinkling in the occasional dry, hilarious witticism is perfectly done here. Neil Patrick Harris is spot on and so effectively defies his Barney-type performance to become something serious and even creepy is wonderful. And Tyler Perry, ladies and gentlemen! I've only known him from the Madea movie trailers, which are so not for me, but his limited role in this is spectacular, would love to see him like this in more movies.Definitely worth a watch and worth the conversations it elicits afterward."

" A movie for today
",0.0,-0.6689,2019-09-07 00:00:00,7,"Although this movie was released in 2014, it should be remembered today with all those #metoo floating in the social media. Even if this movie can tell us about the nasty side of psychopathy or the terrifying side-effects of being in the spotlight, what I loved most was that finally woman was not the heroine of the story.
Usually, the woman is the victim which will regain her power and show off that she was right from the early beginning of the movie. Let's take The Girl on the Train or even Return to Sender with the same Rosamund Pike on the lead-role. In both movies, men are the bad guys with no good sides. And women always win no matter that sometimes there may be some of their fault in the consequences. However, firstly, this movie evolves as something similar to the films mentioned, evolves as a thypical thriller about a woman who fooled a bad husband, on the other hand, soon the character of a woman-role gets a chance to fully develop. And we see that the actions have consequences. And it is a rule for everybody, not only for men. And if this is not enough, finally the psychopath is not so charming as in American Psycho or The Clockwork Orange. All of the uncomfortable moments are presented here as well. Thank you so much for this!
What to mention about a script that fully catches the viewer's attention and a natural acting. Yeah, it is a long and great movie to spend the day with and not to forget within the upcoming months."
" Reminiscent of botched Season 8 of Game of Thrones
",0.0,-0.9998,2019-09-05 00:00:00,1,"Sorry to break the spell, but GG reminds me of botched Season 8 of Game of Thrones or a ridiculously plotted B movie. Evidence to follow.The story development boils down to whatever character thoughts, actions, or traits serves the writer at the moment, even if they're illogical or contradict what was previously presented. Making story matters worse, we're subject to lengthy and peripheral side stories, such as the media, detective, and attorney. All supposedly clever people who enter the story to establish suspicion of the husband's guilt, when it's not needed because only the reader needs to be convinced the husband is guilty. We don't need these add-no-value side stories that take up time and detract from the main characters' relationship.For background, the female protagonist (Amy) is established as smart, sophisticated, and cleverly pegs other people. So let's peg this script's list of issues, just the short list because we don't have room for the whole wad.The writer can't make up her mind how Amy feels about her husband. In one chapter, she describes Amy acknowledging to herself that the male squeeze is her soulmate. Chapters later, she simply changes it to Amy never felt he was the one - because it serves at that moment instead of rewriting the story to make the switch logical. Chapters later, she writes herself into the opposite corner, so changes it again, but seems to remember that she had written the opposite so tosses in a toss-away line that's supposed to take the place of a difficult rewrite to clear up these and gobs of other story holes.To set-up her husband as a potential wife abuser, Amy pretends that she needs to buy a gun to protect herself from him. So she goes to a run-down shopping mall because she knows the place in inhabited by an assortment of drug users, con men, homeless, and ex or current criminals who may be able to sell her a gun - for protection. Yes, you read that right. Amy's fearful of bodily harm so goes alone to a decrepit mall where she wades in deeply with a wide assortment of characters who could individually or collectively create bodily harm; and she does this because she's in fear of bodily harm. Amy bypasses safe and convenient gun stores and pawn shops because the writer clearly didn't think it would look cool enough. Not logical doesn't factor into the equation. If the writer wanted cool and logical, then figuring out how to have both is the hard job of the skilled writer instead of this lazy option.And there's more nonsensical plotting. Amy uses this gun acquisition as fake evidence, but then she stays with her husband for months AFTER she buys the gun. To elaborate on this last point, Amy is educated, has no children, and has parents who live not so far away. Yet the reader and police are to believe that a woman who is portrayed as smart, clever, and independent - and not suffering from any mental condition that intimidates her from leaving - stays and sleeps in the same bedroom with a man she supposedly no longer loves and is deathly afraid of instead of leaving in spite of having every means and supposed reason to leave.Amy's disguise: The missing and possibly dead Amy, whose face is widely broadcast across media channels, isn't recognized supposedly because she changed her hair color and style, gained 15 pounds, and donned eyeglasses. This is like saying if a coworker attempted the same disguise while on vacation, upon her return, no one at work would recognize her? Everyone would be flummoxed stating, ""Who's the new person!"" But no, the writer wants Amy to mingle with other people, so to get around this little problem of her being a missing person who's all over the news, the writer barely modifies her appearance and she's safely incognito.While supposedly incognito, Amy is easily manipulated by a couple who are presented as questionably ethical. But isn't Amy's supposedly super clever about reading people? So the story needs her to be ignorant about people now, so she's simply written that way. And yep, they don't recognize that's her, the famous kidnap victim, behind her new hairdo, glasses, and 15 pounds.Amy's hiding from the news media, yet she agrees to meet her old boyfriend at a casino - yes a casino - filled with guests and employees, and where cameras are taping everything. Adding to this mess, Amy later decides to kill her old boyfriend, but her supposed smarts don't kick in to alert her that his whereabouts will be traced back and she'll be seen meeting him in that casino. If your brain isn't hurting at this point, then you don't care about carefully plotted stories.To build evidence to support her claim of being kidnapped, Amy conveniently feigns distress in front of her fake captor's home security cameras (yep, now that security cameras are supposed to serve the story, they simply do). Yet, those same cameras have shown her willingly entering the home. The reader is simply supposed to ignore that contradiction.Amy's pretending to be missing, but - I kid you not - she CALLS the police to drop a clue that they should look in her sister-in-law's shed. The police simply look in the shed to find a key clue to then charge her husband with her disappearance. Yet NO ONE asks who that woman was who CALLED IN HER OWN VOICE to give them a KEY CLUE that she SOMEHOW knew? We're to believe that the police didn't immediately trace where the call came from and then question everyone in the area and search for video recordings that may have recorded who was there? And wouldn't the police have played the tape for her husband and relatives to see if they recognized the voice, because if they had, everyone would have realized not only is Amy not dead, but she obviously set up her husband, and the police can now trace where she had been. Yet because the story needs the police to charge her husband at this point, this nonsense is simply plopped into the plot, but we're still to believe that not only is Amy smart, but the police and reader are abject idiots - because they need to be so that the writer doesn't have to do the work fixing this mess.After killing her old boyfriend, Amy drives for hours, bypassing homes, stores, hospitals, and fire and police stations to drive directly back to a man whom she had portrayed in her diary as an abusive and suspicious potential murderer. Amy is suddenly portrayed as someone with no mental concept that the police will find this suspicious. So why now this ridiculous contradiction? Because the writer wants to describe the husband's reaction when he discovers his wife has returned by having her appear directly in front of him. So the writer simply scribbles it in even though it makes no sense and contradicts Amy's diary, makes her look suspicious, and contradicts how smart Amy is supposed to be. This type of ""write whatever serves at the moment"" style of story development is insulting. As always, there's more. After driving for hours, lucidly stopping at light after light, making turns, etc., Amy walks into her husband's arms then pretends to feint for dramatic effect. And no one is suspicious. And we're also to believe that Amy's parents and police wouldn't address and try to prevent Amy from returning to a man she portrayed in her diary as someone she feared might kill her?Amy planned to kill herself hoping Nick would be blamed. After changing her mind and returning home, she supposedly uses her husband's frozen sperm to impregnate herself. No matter that she's been all over the news as a kidnap and rape victim and she's now home with her supposed lovey-dubby-hubby who can do the fathering himself, we're to believe she runs to a sperm clinic to impregnate herself with his frozen sperm. And apparently no one at the clinic is suspicious, especially of this woman who must still be suffering from PTSD. Why is frozen sperm even in the plot? Because the plot needs something convenient at this moment to show Amy as having 'cleverly' plotted the pregnancy to get her hubby back. But wait! Hadn't Amy planned to kill herself? But now the plot wants her to decide not to kill herself, so the writer goes back to drop in a frozen sperm story even though it contradicts subsequent sequences where Amy plans to kill herself. So we have Amy changing her mind, killing someone to cover up her own self-kidnapping, and returning to hubby, who she predicts will reject her, so she has frozen his sperm months in advance so that upon her return she can get pregnant to rope him in?As part of Amy's fake kidnap crime scene, she claims she was hit on the head, but upon her return, she receives a medical exam and there's no evidence of the injury. How does the writer fix this contradiction instead of doing the hard work of making the plot logical? She simply has Amy threaten to make the police look bad if they question her and then show the police intimidated by this limpid threat. The police, medical team, and reader need to be treated like idiots for this to work. Not only, but the police haven't been portrayed as idiots who are instantly fearful of a limpid threat. And what was it with Amy parading around in blood soaked clothes after leaving the hospital where she had been examined? The hospital and police supposedly release a crime victim still clothed in blood soaked evidence! The writer wants the character to parade around in blood for ridiculous shock value, so she simply writes it in even though it's insanely illogical. The story also needs to show that not one detective has checked into any of these contradictions and sought evidence even months after her return. The reality? Her ruse would have been discovered within days by looking into just one of her slew of mistakes.This story comes across as a not-worked-out draft. Anyone can decipher why this story had any draw, which was nothing more than a few flip-flop twist scenes. Like Season 8 of Game of Thrones, shame on everyone who greenlighted this convoluted mess."
" Marvelous Work by David Fincher
",0.5994,-0.7655,2019-08-25 00:00:00,8,"Gone Girl is a film that makes you feel the increase of tension by the minute. The preface might seem baffling as the husband claimed to have the urge to break the skull of his wife. As the story unfolded, however, the intricate relations between the couple was to be revealed.Being a graduate from Ivy League, the wife is a quite ambitious woman, authoring a well-known series book. After marriage, her discontent has been fermented due to his husband's indifferent attitude. Her diary counted the process in which their happy union gradually turned sour. While everyone was suspecting that the husband might have murdered the wife and afterwards made a rather clumsy attempt at disguising it as an abduction, the storyline took a drastic turn. It turned out that the wife orchestrated the whole incident to set up her husband. As the story continues to pan out, the cold-blooded personality of the wife is to be completely exhibited.The performance of the two protagonists was commendable, which also helped to justify the bizarre plot of the film."

Still worth watching but you will end up cursing the writers, producers and perhaps even the actors for that low quality ending. Even if the story was written to end this way, it could have been communicated far better and with far more realistic excitement. It seems like they just plonked it at the end rather than continue the story. What the hell happened? Did they run out of time or needed to release it by a specific date or did the original scriptwriter run off? The end the film was not of the same quality of the rest of the film and left me feeling shortchanged."

The ending sucks because it doesn't fit reality at all. A police detective will never let a murderer walk free if the evidence is out there. She makes some attempts to unravel everything for the FBI crowd during the hospital scene and then out of nowhere gives up at the end of the movie.That is why the movie is not in the 10/10 ball park, but it is nevertheless a damn good one.

" Captivating to its core
",0.0,0.997,2019-07-24 00:00:00,10,"After seeing this movie I became speechless. The only word that came to my mind was ""WOW"" but I don't think even that justifies how amazing this movie was. Gone Girl is hands down one of the best thrillers I've ever come across.David Fincher, known for his previous films like Fight Club, Seven and The Social Network, has masterfully directed this movie. He brings out tension throughout this film like no other filmmaker. The cinematography is top-notch and the screenplay by Gillian Flynn, who also wrote the book, is extremely engrossing. Flynn adds a ton of development to the characters accompanied with many twists and turns which allowed the film to be riveting as well as unpredictable. On a technical level, Gone Girl is perfect.The acting was superb. Ben Affleck is terrific as the husband. He portrays a great amount of emotion whilst being under media scrutiny in the film. An actor who I was skeptical about, who is in the film, is Tyler Perry due to his filmography consisting of the poorly received Madea films but to my surprise he shouldered his role well. However, the best part of the film is Rosamund Pike who gives the best perfomance of her entire career. Not only is her character so interesting but her portrayal of that character is Oscarworthy. Her dialogue delivery and body language is perfect. I can't envision any other actress playing this role after seeing Pike's performance.Gone Girl also has a lot of social commentary on the media and the way we perceive them. It's incredible how one headline can change a person's view on someone or how one small detail can be manipulated to make someone look bad. This message, alongside the main story, were done in such a realistic manner that we, as an audience, can relate to and believe what the characters are going through.All in all, Gone Girl is outstanding. The nail-biting script, Fincher's harrowing direction and the amazing performances by everyone make this film really intense, dark and disturbing. If you're a fan of thrillers or enjoy films as a whole, definitely seek this film out."

" A Critical Analysis
",-0.3182,0.8288,2019-07-05 00:00:00,8,"A bizzare piece of suspenseful masterclass. The psychological thriller that gets you shivering and leaves that halter hanging around your neck even after it's done, just in case. A movie that, with it's weird dysfunctional ending where Amy(Rosamund Pike) returns to Nick(Ben Affleck), keeps you thinking, wondering and questioning the happenings.
Portraying this bizzare and gripping plot, full of twists and turns, where morality is thrown out of the window, are the wonderful performances of the two lead actors, especially Pike's ghastly and loathsome performance as Amy Dunne. A wonderful side cast to got along with it, one that complements the two beautifully and no matter how little the screen time, makes their presence felt (Tyler Perry, Neil Patrick Harris, Nick's sister, Go, Amy's parents, the Police Officers, etc.).All through this gripping plot that keeps you engaged, vital questions on:
1. marriage problems
2. effects of the recession on families
3. cancer awareness
4. adultery
5. dysfunctional relationships
6. pregnancy problems
7. sensationalization of news by the media
8. effects of social empathyare also highlighted. Overall, the movie is probing work of that ticks most boxes of a good movie with strong social messages and nice portrayal of the contemporary society, enveloped by the preposterous psychopathic saga of the couple. However, the uncertainty about the ending, no matter how intentional, leaves a sour taste in the mouth and certain feeling of incompleteness to the story, a cliffhanger of sorts that is never resolved (unless there's supposed to be a part 2!)"

very conniving and calculated crazy evil woman. That character is extremely interesting and intriguing... fascinating, even. I was wondering if she set him up so I didn't really get twisted. many shocking moments like the sex/murder scene and the bottle insertion.The ending was disappointing and unsatisfying the first time. Part of me thought it was a good ending for being untraditional and not giving the viewers what they want. The other part of me thought there's no way a person would be okay with that and just live with it and not try to do something about it. on second viewing I loved it. I thought it was a perfect ending that made perfect sense for the story leading up to it and summed up the characters perfectly. the third time... now i think the ending is pretty genius and possibly the most unexpected outcome anyone could have thought of.But seriously, she kept his sperm?!?! so crazy. I also liked how it showed how terrible the media is and supports why I don't watch the news. And how people jump to conclusions about people they don't know and situations they know nothing about"

After twists, turns and shocks I was expecting so much more from its finale. A miscarriage to what was a perfect build up.

In this one, however, I observed him breaking out from that boring style and truly earning my full respect with his outstanding performance. As for R. Pike, I have been following her since her role in Sense and Sensibility and she has never disappointed me once. In this movie, she goes one step forward and delivers a top notch performance as a sociopathic wife. I also liked the supporting cast out of which C. Coon shines. This is a well-directed, skillfully shot cinema work with probably one flaw: its length.

Usually with movies this long I find myself looking at the time remaining much more often than I did in this case. Gone Girl really did move along at a fast clip, with a fair amount of momentum and suspense--until the very end.It is unfortunate that so many creators toil away to produce their works only to dash off a fast and very unsatisfying conclusion, which effectively turns what could have been great into something quite a bit less valuable. I have noticed this a lot in recent books for which authors appear to receive advances rather than having to pitch them after they already exist as completed works.

" Mostly good
",0.4404,0.6608,2019-04-27 00:00:00,7,"The film begins on the day of the fifth wedding anniversary of Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (Rosamund Pike), a not-so-happily married couple who live in a small town in Missouri . On that day, Amy is discovered to be missing after a home break-in. During the investigation, there is evidence that Nick might be responsible for Amy's disappearance.For the most part, ""Gone Girl"" is superb as an edge-of-your-seat thriller. This is not surprising considering the director is David Fincher who did so well with ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" (2008) and especially with ""The Social Network"" (2010). His cast is very good. Affleck is great as the film's anchor; Pike shows superior skills in a way I won't mention here in order to avoid spoilers. The screenplay, by Gillian Flynn (based on her novel) has many fascinating twists and turns especially a plot device borrowed from the classic ""Vertigo"" (1958): bringing the audience up to speed midway through the movie.While ""Gone Girl"" had the potential to be a great movie, it is sadly marred by an ending that is unsatisfying and disappointing. Fiction is allowed some distance from real life but this film takes too many liberties to the point of being far-fetched. Also, in the portrayal of the rushed presumption of guilt on men who are accused of mistreating women, the viewer is left with a biased lack of balance in this ongoing and necessary debate. - dbamateurcritic"

Love problems, marriage, being a liar, distrust, disappointment, society, crime, suspects, complicated stuff. It teaches us to be more aware of who we fall in love with and who we marry. It is too long, and story is a bit unfinished, it doesn't end clearly, and more likely returns to beginning. If you like drama you should watch this. But if you are looking for thriller, action, crime, you may disappointed by this movie, as it is filled with too much talk and drama. You know, the boring slow useless stuff. For such unclear story, it should definitely lasted at least as twice as shorter than it really is. I liked the topic, that is relationships and psychopaths, and in that such things are reality. This film is reality. There are emotions like hope, trust, hate, anger, and disappointment. Downside is that this lasts too long, meaning requires a lot of time and energy to watch."

I can go deeper in explanations but this comment will become a page so I will repeat my title - DON'T GET FOOLED BY THE RATING!!! or the hype around the movie. Let me ask you all out there (not just man because this works both ways) - Would you stayed in a relationship with a sociopath? And also don't rush your answer or blame that she is pregnant because she wasn't pregnant when she started her plan that's why she take the urine of the neighbor lady and she couldn't got pregnant from Neil Patrick Harry's character because they had sex like a week ago which I think is too early even for a pregnancy test. I've watched more than 2000 movies and I can assure you that even if you like the movie the ending will destroy all those feelings.

Firstly the plot as it unfolds is predictable at best, there aren't really too many omg I never thought that would happen moments. More like...oh... I kind of thought that was gonna happen. The story gradually just gets more and more ridiculous to the point where you just think why am I still putting myself through this. Plus the plot lines just full of holes. For one Afflek calls the police before even checking with anyone else where his wife might be and then they launch a press release and a statewide manhunt inside a week of her ""vanishing"" he THEN calls her parents to see if she's with them.. Ok he does a really crud job pretending he's sad she's dissappeared but then they were looking to get a divorce so that could be allowed. Moving on we find out that his wife has staged her death to frame him so he gets lethal injection just becuase they had a few marital problems, then runs away only to get busted, meet her ex, slit his throat pretend she was raped and then return back to Affleck somehow insemminating herself with his semen when she didn't want kids!!!!! On a positive note, the camera work and special effects are decent. Story line is mediocre but it does keep you gripped until the end... Certainly nothing to write home about."

Due to the society's favor to amy, Nick became a target of mass media. With all the television and newspaper's report, a moral panic within the community stared to growth. In this case, Nick became a threat in this community, also became a symbol of disgust. His friend and neighbor started to get away from him. And little by little, he became the 'most' hated man in America.The moral panic made by mass media happend in this film is stronge enough to effect a huge community even it is a indicent between two individuals.

I would have thought even a 10 year old child would be able to see at least some of this movie's glaring issues, but apparently not since many grown adults thought this movie was brilliant if not down-right flawless!!! Clearly there are many people that lack any ability to critically analyze a movie, as the least bit of critical analysis reveals this plot as being utterly terrible.I'm not going to waist my time analyzing every issue with this movie, I'll just point out one of the many events that was utterly laughable. A man clearly realizes his wife of 5 years is framing him for her (faked) murder. He also finds out that she framed an ex-boyfriend for rape years ago. Yet when she returns home he not only doesn't try to have her arrested for framing him for murder (and also for obviously having just framed a second ex-boyfriend for rape before slitting his throat), but he actually decides to continue to sleep in the same house as this psycopath!!Never before have I seen a movie insult my intelligence to the extent this movie did. I can only assume the reason some people didn't realize this movie was blatantly insulting their intelligence is because they have no intelligence to insult in the first place."
" A silver screen adaptation, equal of the titular novel's level of quality and intrigue.
",0.0,0.9794,2019-03-11 00:00:00,8,"''Gone Girl'' is one of those rare type of films which are at the same level, in terms of quality and character, with their original source, that is the novel. Gillian Flynn's ''Gone Girl'' is her third, in chronological order, novel that was published, after ''Sharp Objects'' (won the 2007 Ian Fleming Steel Dagger for the best thriller) and ''Dark Places'', a book which was also successfuly adapted to cinema film in 2015 by Gilles Paquet-Brenner, starring Charlize Theron. ''Gone Girl'' received wide praise and many compliments, and it is considered to be Flynn's tour de force, a crime/mystery novel narrated by -more or less- unreliable characters' point of view, a fact that makes the viewer to remain vigilant for the 2 hours and half that is -approximately- the movie's running time.
The story revolves around the two protagonists, Nick and Amy Dunne, a married couple which seems to be totally in love with each other at the beginning of their relationship, only to find out in time, that they fell in love with an illusion of the other that they built themselves. The intricate, though not hard to follow, plot of the film begins to unfold when in the day of their fifth's wedding anniversary, Amy (Rosamund Pike) disappears from the house and seems to be gone for good. Her husband, Nick (Ben Affleck), is shocked at first and seems to be willing to day what is necessary to find out the truth behind his wife's action, but slowly it becomes obvious that Amy had set him up for her -supposed- murder. Through Nick's conversations, mainly with his twin sister, Margo, the viewer discover that things were not what they seem and the marriage of Nick and Amy was far from being ideal. As the days pass and Amy is still missing, the police begins to unearth the clues that Amy had left them in order to incriminate Nick and after finding the -possibly- murder weapon they arrest him.
This is a -condensed- synopsis of the film's first one hour and the following 90 minutes has a lot of twists and turns in store for the viewer who must not lose his focus in order to fully enjoy the viewing experience of one of the best crime films of the year (2014). ''Gone Girl'' is a film, having two truly shady characters as protagonists which are hard to like, much more to identify with, but this doesn't mean that they are not brilliantly outlined and fleshed out, as well as alluring and enthralling. Rosamund Pike's performance is a great one but unfortunately Ben Affleck's acting is below expectations and perhaps with another actor in the role of Nick, ''Gone Girl'' would be irresistible. David Fincher's direction is impeccable -as always- and guarantees an unforgettable artistic achievement, a movie that the audience will remember for the years to come as on of the iconic flicks of the crime/mystery genre.
If you still haven't watched it, do it without giving it a second thought. You will be thoroughly entertained and intrigued by this fabulous storyline and plot."

I understand why this movie has high ratings but the book was by far better than the movie. If you haven't read the book, the movie is worth a watch."
" The holes hold the clues to solving this mystery
",0.34,-0.9902,2019-03-01 00:00:00,6,"Not having read Gillian Flynn's 2012 novel of this same title, I don't know if the book had plot holes as the movie does. Fellow mystery aficionados know that for every plot hole in a story the writer is omitting or covering up a major clue. And, so this film has some, which leads crime and mystery buffs to suspect what follows.""Gone Girl"" is a good murder mystery, but not a great one. It is presented in such a way that audiences won't know right away if there has been a murder. And, it's obviously portrayed so that many will assume that Ben Affleck's Nick Dunne really ""done it."" (I couldn't resist.) Then, it's only a matter of time as the story unravels and viewers see the ""what"" and the ""how"" of the crime. Aha, but what crime?I don't know if the author or the movie producers were trying to emulate Alfred Hitchcock, but the fright factor here doesn't come close to him. Nor does the suspense equal that of the usual Dashiel Hammett, Agatha Christie or John Grisham mystery. It is apparent very early that Amy Dunne has staged her disappearance to make it look like a killing, probably to get even with Nick. As the story unfolds, it bears that out.None of the performances here are great. Some are very good - Rosamund Pike as Amy, Carrie Coon as Nick's sister, Margo, and Tyler Perry as attorney Tanner Bolt. The rest of the cast were fair to good except for Affleck. He was lifeless and underplayed his role terribly. One suspects that was intended by the director to further build suspicion of him. I just saw him as lazy, and bored stiff.While one can see the deception very early, the second plot and murder of Desi Collings is a surprise. The end to the story isn't clear, so that keeps the suspense going.Some other reviewers have noted the portrayals of the frenzied crowds, in response to the social media craze and modern news media that tend to be in one's face. That's a good thing to highlight. The ending doesn't bring the story to closure as endings should. In that also, ""Gone Girl"" doesn't belong with the good mysteries of the masters named above. Hitchcock or Hammett could wrap up the mystery and still leave readers and viewers with a question or two. But, they always saw that justice was served, one way or another. Not so, though, in this film.Detective Rhonda Boney was very competent as a crime investigator. That is, up to the point of the plot holes. And, those are where Amy's ruse would quickly have unraveled. Here are just the most obvious ones. The first is the car Amy is driving. Was it her car, and if so, why were the police not looking for it? If it was a car she just bought or rented, she would have had to stash it some place where she could get to it quickly. And she would have had to pay for it. The car company people would have recognized her face from all the later publicity.The second big hole, which the movie doesn't really show but talks a lot about, is the huge store of goods that Nick was supposed to have bought. When and how did Amy get all that stuff past Nick and stored in their garage and his father's house? How many people might have seen her hauling the stuff there over a few weeks? If she had bought the stuff in person, police checks would have nailed her. The golf pro or store clerk who sells a fancy set of golf clubs is not going to soon forget the person who made such a purchase. And, Nick didn't golf so no one would ever have seen him golfing. Likewise for anyone using someone else's credit card over the telephone.Among other holes would be the tapes at Desi Collings's home that would have shown them arriving and being normal. Amy would have had to somehow erase those. And competent police would wonder why they were erased?What was the very clue that Amy was not murdered but had planned the ""crime?"" It was the police finding the envelope marked Clue One. That told one that Nick did not know about that note before their anniversary, and that Amy had left it as she always did for a treasure hunt on their anniversary.Those not satisfied with the ending might imagine any number of future horrors living with the psychotic Amy who says she is now going to have a baby. What of that poor baby or toddler the first time he or she upsets Amy? But, as the film actually ends, it invites an obvious closure that would be classic Hitchcock.Remember Greta and Jeff who robbed Amy of all her money? Greta had sat with ""Nancy,"" watching all the TV coverage of Amy's disappearance. She knew Amy was hiding out and had phony glasses. When she and Jeff run out of money, she will have a nice story to tell a newspaper about remembering that woman in the Ozarks. Or, if she and Jeff get in trouble with the law, she can plea-bargain by telling about that gal from the motel who was on the run with a wad of dough. She was always watching the TV coverage and commenting about the missing Amy Dunne.Hitchcock would have a final scene as the credits role. So, the psychotic nymphomaniac, Amy, would come to justice. Greta dials the phone in a phone booth. She starts to speak, ""About that Amy Dunne who said she was kidnapped and raped..."" and the sound fades as the camera pulls back and the credits roll."

I'm glad I persevered.This is the sort of movie that needs to be watched a couple or more times as, I'm sure, a lot of the finer pints will undoubtedly be missed on the first (possibly even the second or more) viewing.Although very cleverly and stylishly made, I did think it was a somewhat overlong and could have been made punchier and more memorable if compacted/tightened a little... say, to maybe 1hr45 or even 2 hours.As alluded to, the storyboard/script was intelligently and cleverly written although (perhaps?) a little too much so? I think even Columbo would've had trouble here.At just after the 2hr mark, the blood from the throat-slashing scene was - I believe - a little too dark for arterial blood.Also, the scenes in which the absconded lead is befriended by a couple of muggers (ending in her getting mugged) added no real benefit to the story whatsoever. Anyway...Overall a very good, and very well made film, with an excellent central performance by Rosalind Pike.I'd, ideally, rate this 7.5 but, as there are no half-stars, I'll tread carefully and opt for an 7/10.Recommended."

Having never seen that before, It's hard to deny that I was very engaged and interested to see the story flip in on itself. What I found most impressive was the way the film radically changed my perception of it's characters several times through my first watch.Unfortunately, I do think this film is held back by some seriously lack luster performances. It shines in it's ability to tell you just enough to be invested in the protagonist, whilst saving his flaws for fascinating reveals. However, Ben Afflecks relaxed schlub is highly forgettable and fails to deliver any convincing emotion, and Rosamund Pikes blank faced sociopath is equally uninspired.Overall, Gone Girl offers an interesting plot ripe for inspiration. However, the characters were either written or performed in a way that they themselves were not as interesting as the things that were happening around them.

It's not Fincher's most provocative or disturbing work but it's still one of his very best films and without a doubt worth more than one viewing to really take in the collage of performances, story, music, sound and indelible images. It's truly one of those movie you should before you die"

" Over-rated
",0.0,0.9772,2019-01-15 00:00:00,7,"14 November 2014. I suspect why this movie is getting rave reviews and good box office turnout is due to its sustained measured suspense as a dramatic thriller where the who done it element becomes convoluted and layered with great emotional intensity as the audience is seemingly and subtly manipulated throughout the movie as to Ben Affleck's character and the apparent absence and presumed demise of his wife. Things become extraordinarily complicated that gives the audience a continuous shot of neurological brain transmitters of titillating endorphins.
One other pertinent fact that impacts my own personal experience watching this movie is that living in Utah where Susan Powell disappeared who lived in West Valley City, Utah and whose body was never been found and Josh Powell, her husband, was suspected in her disappearance and who later killed himself along with their two children. There were many parallels between this real event and Gone Girl.
But perhaps I am getting old; and watching this movie I'm reminded of Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner in The War of the Roses (1989). If the movie had stopped two-thirds of the way through the movie with the first major twist, I might have really enjoyed this movie in its totality, but it continued with this odd twist that seemed like a guise for greatest as a film. Needlessly the audience is forced to watch a rather predictable sequence of events that seem creatively amazing but somehow it just seems tacked on with the appearance of genius. I can understand why this movie would seem innovative and offer up some new revelation of the human psyche not see before on the big screen.
Perhaps its just I was unfortunately lucky to begin to put the pieces of this mystery thriller together too soon, but this overly long, in places overly slow paced movie became too predictable, foreshadowing its scenes and the ending. For awhile the plot and characters were fascinating, the plot intriguing but eventually, the movie just seemed very good. Others might conclude this movie portrays a rather unique, albeit rarely seen complex characters who diverge from the ordinary two dimensional personas. While this might be true, there is something off-balance but not in aesthetic way, but detracting way. What David Fincher is striving for is one of the most difficult achievements in film directing. His effort is commendable, if somewhat unsatisfying for me. If the movie had been shot in the style and tone of say cerebral spy thriller The Russia House (1990) or Ben Affleck's The Sum of All Fears (2002), Gone Girl would have come across more in keeping with the icy, frigid psychologically tension and dramatic tone of the theme of the movie. One of the best examples of this conflicted tone might be Brad Pitt's character and performance as scripted in Interview with A Vampire (1995) or his scripted performance in the dramatic crime thriller Killing Them Softly (2012) or even Nicholas Cages scripted portrayal in The Weatherman (2005) or Daniel Day-Lewis in the drama filled There Will Be Blood (2007). Even the classic bitter sweet relational drama and alcohol-riddled theme of The Days of Wine and Roses (1962) has the oil and water imbalance that however is deliciously sweet and sour tone that this movie might have been well to have captured. Or take Nicole Kidman's harsh but memorable role in Margot at the Wedding (2007) or her role in Dogville (2004) or what happened to Brad Pitt in the superb mystery crime thriller Se7en (1995). Other edgy movie themed and uneasy but dramatic riveting movies that capture the paradoxical tone of beautiful ugliness include William H. Macy in Edmond (2006), Sam Rockwell's fascinating character in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), the dysfunctional family of American Beauty (2000), or Tom Cruise in Collateral (2004) even whose title is reflective of the dissonance of a battle where innocence is destroyed. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in director Stanley Kubrick seemed to capture both the cinematic beauty and the uneasy alliance between the unusual, fantastic in an artful and sinfully beautiful way with characters that sometimes lack in moral turpitude in his Eyes Wide Shut (1999) or take the sociological business war with its incumbent cold calculating businessmen of The Social Network (2010). Even Leo DeCaprio seemed to capture the decadent attractive sleaze character in The Great Gatsby (2013) or his performance as Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004). What seems to be missing is the more balanced background of the development of the relationship, a better visceral sense of the characters as they evolve which is conveniently missing during the movie, except with deliberate shocking sometimes unflattering flashbacks which was seemingly achieved with one character played by Christian Slater in He Was A Quiet Man (2007). The real fault in this very difficult film is that absence of the depiction of the behind the scenes of the false facades and the real persona essences of which even the characters themselves are unaware so as to reveal the hidden pane in Johari Window."

Go and watch literally any film you've never seen before on Netflix or Prime Now and there you will find a true 1/10.Anyway, Gone Girl provides for a suspenseful and clever (even if some don't appreciate it) twist on a classic tale, wife disappears and the husband looks to fit the bill, etc, etc.Some describe Affleck as very wooden, but he is playing the actual character very well. The plot genuinely took turns I did not see coming, and though the ending may be decisive it is a very symbolic and smart ending based on the twists and turns that arise. Especially taking the opening line and the ending line and putting them together.Gone Girl allows for the support roles to shine, a story to be told with genuine turns you will not be coming and it certainly delivers on the intrigue. Give it a watch, you'll enjoy the ride."

What is more concerning is that IMDB has allowed a series of negative reviews, presumably posted by the usual Ben Affleck trolls, which as we all know is an internet meme. If this carries on I will ignore IMDB reviews. They've even occasionally posted negative reviews under a ten star rating. Get it sorted IMDB. Many of the one star reviews are identical."
" Incredible
",0.0,0.9929,2019-01-08 00:00:00,10,"Gone Girl was a movie I waited on watching for several years due to the extreme nature of the whole film. From the opening shot, I couldn't take my attention off the screen. It is directed with a level of professionalism and passion behind every movement, sound, word, and frame. It's an extremely unpredictable and effective thriller which had me feeling incredibly uneasy and off balance, which was a clear sign of perfect filmmaking. The cinematography was gorgeous and every shot was either stunning in terms of framing, or mind blowing in terms of the amount of work put into the particular shot. The performances were amazing, and I was consistently taken by surprise by the depth and complexity behind the tone and portrayal of every character. Gone Girl had an incredibly well written screenplay for such a rich, authentic, and captivating thriller. This movie was presented with an artistic way of going about developing characters, framing certain shots, and building extreme tension and unease. David Fincher's direction along with the immaculate screenplay and rich performances made this one of the best movies I've ever seen. Although this movie is phenomenal and very well done, it's a disturbing, graphic, and violent thriller which is not much of a surprise when you consider the past work of David Fincher. In the end, it's simply one of the best movies I've ever seen because of how it is perfectly directed, superbly acted, very well written, and extremely effective."

",0.0,0.7615,2018-12-28 00:00:00,6,"..The viewers are left to 'fill in' the glaring holes and loose ends by their own, most notably why and how the Police and FBI's ineptitude is beyond repair..A few unlikely reasons could be:* The following media circus influenced high ranking officials to consider this a 'case closed'* Rosamund Pike's character's rich parents influenced high ranking officials to consider this a 'case closed'Both of the above combined with that 'Gone Girl' (the movie, not the character) maybe deliberately makes a parody of the majority of investigators - except 'Rhonda Boney' who knows the ""victim"" is a liar - high profile media coverage and the juidicial system.A political comment about farcical media 'for the masses' and corruption. Dark satire of sorts. If you will.Previous 1/10 reviews I found good were the ones pointing to the numerous plot errors, I'll just add to a few previous points:
* She bought that cheap car for her disappearance with cash to avoid a transaction trail, you'd assume she'd further already have fake IDs/licences/car registered in a phony name, etc. in order to avoid being traced - further assuming her fake alias(es) would check out when scrutinized
* The monitor camera for the sex/murder scene could be either turned off or there was no camera for that angle/bedroom
* You might assume she could have deleted any camera recordings that disprove kidnapping and abuse - if she had access
* The Neil Patrick Harris character wouldn't have an alibi for the duration of the ""kidnapping"" and 'Amy' wouldn't be recognized by anyone when they were seen together, even that guy who remarked she looked familiar and none of the neighbours noticed her leaving the house alone during the ""kidnapping"" (most unlikely)(Might give this a rewatch in case some details are wrong, in that case an edit will follow)Movie suspension of disbelief fanfare and then some. She'd be caught and convicted, hands down. But hey, Ben Affleck's character ended up with those sweet deals in the end, pointed out by his top priced lawyer.So it's all good?Implausible plot especially towards the end qualify for a 1/10 on its own. But seen as dark comedy disguised as thriller.. Overall 6/10, nice production. Affleck, Pike and supporting cast did alright."

",0.0,0.9271,2018-12-17 00:00:00,8,"The film is absolutely gripping from the first scene. The raw and chilling look of the wife makes us want to see the layers of her character. And the husband is also very well sketched in his flawed relationship to his twin. Interestingly confusing at first whether or not he is the murderer, but soon resolves that question and takes the story forward. The transformations of look of the wife is spectacular. Acting- A grade. Plotting of murder-amazing. Characters- believable, even the wife is relateable inspite her actions. What she wanted is what people want from each other in today's relationships. Marriage is compromising self to get the love of the partner, and wanting the other to be as they like, it's this relateable theme which grabs the attention on a deeper level.
No matter the compromises, things do get beneficial at the end. Oh! What a sarcasm on the face of people from the fine storyteller!"

Gone Girl could've had so much potential - if it was 20 minutes shorter and didn't follow a frankly predictable direction, including the so-called 'twist'. The same can be said for the soundtrack, particularly during the break-in scene.The redemption (and extra star for the review) of the film for me is Affleck and Pike's performances.Ultimately, an adaptation that does not do the source material justice."

Having said that the story, contains at least one huge plot hole. She is supposed to be pregnant when she disappears, yet when she is at the hospital after her return, nobody thinks to run tests to make sure the baby is ok. This would have started unraveling her story because she was never pregnant to that point. Also did the FBI do no investigating at the crime scene at all ?"
" torn
",-0.25,-0.7704,2018-11-19 00:00:00,1,Review: I really didn't like this movie because it doesn't really offer me anything. It takes way too long to progress and there are way too many variables. The direction and screenplay aren't terrible. The casting and acting are terrible. Especially by Rosamund Pike as the wife and the supposed villain who orchestrated her disappearance. I didn't buy Rosamund Pike's performance because there is no real method to her action or then she is unhappy and he husband is cheating. All in all I would give this one out of a possible five stars.
" Meaningless End
",-0.4404,-0.9575,2018-11-16 00:00:00,5,"Just seen this title. As me it is a family drama with a false murder and a real murder. The creator of those two murders is going apparently free. It is injustice. How such a wife having conspiracy mind lives happily with his hubby for ever ? Even father of her child is not confirmed.
However, most of movie is interesting and watchable. 90 % of movie desired 8 star and last 10 % part only deserves 2 star. Climax and end is not perfect according story which was going well till then from the beginning
I don't understand why a husband did not teach a lesson to such criminal minded wife? Why did not he take revenge for his harassment and insulting before the people, TV, Media and police etc ? That is why movie failed here, else it created a high expectations from beginning.Ben Affleck is good. Very good acting for betrayed & confused husband apart from his Batman's role or other heroic roles. Rosamund is perfect wife as requirement of role. Kim Dickens as detective is super. Also Carrie Coon has a memorable role of caring sister of Ben. Casting is perfect. Only week point in the movie is disappointing end otherwise movie would be the best. Watch only if you do like meaningless and empty end."

",0.0,-0.9537,2018-09-30 00:00:00,8,"Gone Girl is an epic case study on the darkest parts of human relationships and marriage. The concept alone left me fearful of everything I cannot control. Rosamund Pike is terrifying while Ben Affleck is cluelessly spectacular. Amy Dunne (Pike) plays out like an evil breed of Annie Wilkes (Misery) and Holly Golightly (Breakfast at Tiffany's). Nick Dunne is a blank and lacking in personality. Yet, for Affleck, the character works. Nick easily becomes the victim of his own stupidity and his wife's cruelty. The only qualm I have with Gone Girl is the length. Director David Fincher previously adopted a five act structure for The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and does the same in his newest flick. While the five act structure allows potent character development, the story has moments that drag. Still, I realize that if the story had been edited and shortened, it would have felt rushed and insincere. The visuals are crisp and clean. The RED Dragon that bore the majority of filming does wonders in the common low light environments. In terms of color grading, nothing is overdone. The colors seem true to real life all while highlighting important reds, golds, and whites.
If you haven't seen Gone Girl, you are doing yourself a disservice. When you are ready to watch it, turn off your phone and get a babysitter for the kids. You don't want to miss a second of this wild ride."

" Gone Girl starring Ben Affleck: Worst movie of the new millenium
",-0.6249,-0.9883,2018-09-05 00:00:00,1,"It has been nearly 4 years since I painfully watched this nightmare of a film in a theater with a couple of friends who unlike me, sort of liked the raunchy and mysterious vibe Fincher created here. Really, I tend to think it was because they spent a good chunk of their hard earned, hard to come by moolah on a dismal cinematic experience. I have noticed lately, bad movies tend to give moviegoers a rather jaded feeling when they are faced with the reality of giving away that hard earned money for a mostly negative experience. The eventuality of it all happens when someone else they know, friends or acquaintances, find out they saw a new release and then ask them ""how was it?"" The painful answer that is given must mask the true reveal of being duped by Hollywood. Go ahead and lie about how you really feel about the flick, even if that means you will give someone else the thumbs up to go ahead waste 2 precious hours they will never get back in their life. Hey! if you don't like it too bad buddy, I did, or at least that's what I told you anyway. Technically, I didn't waste my money if I say I liked a movie, unlike you who is admitting you gave your money away. Unfortunately, misery does love company.I have chosen to reflect on this film Gone Girl nearly 4 years later because I truly haven't ever felt like I did when I left the theater that night that I saw it. I recently stumbled onto a review of this movie on YouTube and my feelings have been excavated and I feel like coming here to express them for everyone and anyone who wants to read about them.I can try to avoid re-iterating much of what I have read during some of the 1 star reviews already posted throughout this page so I will try and focus to what has stuck with me over the course of the last 4 years. I can clearly remember how angry and depressed I felt afterwards, lets just say I felt dejected by this movie. I could think of nothing positive or redeeming about it either back then or now. I mean what was the damn point of it all? Was Fincher trying to test the intelligence quotient of his audience by releasing a movie that had almost no point? Did he or the studio really think people were semi-retarded enough to go along with the mind-numbing stupidity that was occurring on the screen? One question that has lingered around in my head is why did she kill have to NPH like that? Why did they have to sink to such a level of depravity by filming a man getting his throat slashed while climaxing? Afterwards, when she appears all covered in blood after so much time and money was wasted on her disappearance, why did no one really think to investigate her story? The line of questioning scene by the authorities while she was still drenched in blood was quite possibly the worst moments I've ever seen captured on film. I mean not in a B-movie MST3K kind of worst moment, but actually I feel like that scene is the closest I've ever come to feeling the pain of burning in hell. Of course the movie studio and filmmakers totally pull down their pants and moon the audience at the end by asking the viewers to accept that Ben Affleck's character is just going to accept it all and take it in stride. He will willingly go back with this disturbed, psychotic, schizoid woman. It's all OK that she killed her ex-boyfriend in cold blood but c'mon, love somehow conquers all, right? Even logic and simple basic reasoning according to those who were involved in peddling this garbage."

" Too many problems with this
",-0.4019,0.782,2018-08-31 00:00:00,4,"I usually like Fincher's movies (well, some of them) This was not one of them. The story was obvious ripped from Scott and Lacey Peterson with a twist, which actually made it better.However, the dialogue was excruciatingly bad. Way too carefully constructed in a way no one talks. Like a highly choreographed tennis match with perfect call and responses, i.e. the standard overly written repartee. Part of the problem in Hollywood is that dialogue never reflect anything real. It's for the most part written like writers would like to talk like, but never how people actually talk like.Then, there was some of the situations and casting. What's with hiring foreign actors to play American parts? There are no actresses in Hollywood that can do the job? Hint, Rosamund Pike, Lola Kirk .When you call the cops about a potential break in or foul play, detectives don't show up. Regular cops do, but not here. The young attractive mysterious lead woman detective and the sceptic side kick with nothing to say. Did I say cliche? Cops don't interview people together, like Nick and her parents in the same room.Amy writes out her plan on postage notes and puts them on a calendar? Who on earth would do that? You have to be a complete imbecile to do that. Only in badly written movies does that happen.Just the overall behavior of everyone was totally unnatural and inauthentic. That is Fincher's fault. The accents were too over the top. Felt like they forced them too much. And Emily Ratajkowski was supposed to play a 19-20 year old? But she is 30 and she looks that. Why not get someone who IS American and actually that age.If you are interrogated by the cops, you don't force yourself to look guilty. You do the opposite, unlike Pike, her acting was so winking into the camera it was hilarious.I wish it was better. The premise was good, just the execution and writing of it was not."

" A Half Decent Cast Offer Bad Performances In An Awful Movie
",-0.7579,-0.3419,2018-08-20 00:00:00,2,"The cast of ""Gone Girl"" is half decent. The leads are relatively big names - Ben Affleck as Nick and Rosamund Pike as Amy (not the biggest, but certainly known.) The supporting cast wouldn't cause me to swoon, but they're decent enough (people like Tyler Perry, Kim Dickens and Neil Patrick Harris are in this.) But regardless of the so-called ""critical consensus"" (which seems to be very positive) you don't have to get very far into this to discover that you have a half decent cast in what's at best a third-rate movie.I thought the performances by and large (from everyone) were awful. It's as if this half decent cast realized from the start that they were starring in one dog of a movie. The story had some potential. As it starts Amy and Nick are a seemingly happy young couple on top of the world, with money and in love. But things don't work out well for them, they lose their jobs and they have to move from New York City to Missouri to care for Nick's elderly parents and everything about their life unravels. Ultimately - and here's where the whole thing (which wasn't that good to start) falls apart - Amy fakes her own death, and manages to frame Nick for her murder. Nick isn't a good guy - in fact there's not a single character in this movie who's really likeable or sympathetic, except possibly Det. Boney (Dickens) - and once his wife is ""killed"" he becomes the immediate prime suspect (more by the tabloid media than by Boney, who's never entirely convinced about what's happening.) He gets portrayed as a sociopath, but it's really Amy who's the crazy sociopath. The first hour or so of the movie deals with Nick being hounded by the police and media. Then comes the twist - Amy is alive and hiding out, and we get flashbacks now to see how she set the whole thing up. Then another plot twist as Amy's hiding out crashes and burns; then another plot twist with the ex-boyfriend she seeks refuge from; then another plot twist as she returns home. It's not interesting - it's more mind-numbing. It goes on way, way, way too long. Once you get to the third or fourth plot twist you're wondering ""good God - how long can this go on?"" And it goes on far too long. Actually once we're into the story that follows the last plot twist I actually found myself chuckling at times (especially at discovering that the police and hospital have sent Amy back home after she resurfaces, still covered in blood - they could't clean her up?) I wasn't chuckling because it was funny - but because it was just so bad. To me, it seems as if to really like this movie you have to be one of those pathetic ""professional victim"" men, who think women and the world are all out to get them. This will certainly feed their paranoia. (2/10)"

The cast is absolutely brilliant. Every single person played their roles well, but main props go to Rosemund. There really couldn't have been a stronger lead actor. Ben held his own too. Major plus for the soundtrack and Rezner as well. My only critique has to do with ""Amy's descovery interview"" scene. It's unreasonable that they would leave blood all over her and talk to her/send her home that way. I'm not a cop just seems like... no. Other than that directional choice- everything is brilliant."

I love the way that the film's exposition leads the viewer to one conclusion, then another that is contrary to the first, then another. Eventually, the film becomes a commentary on public opinion and the media, even as it explores the complexities of an unusual marriage.The action starts with the disappearance of Amy, but the story evolves quickly. I have read other reviews that decry an abundance of plot holes, but I find most of them to be misunderstandings of the story. Others can be easily explained with some creative thinking. As a whole, the story is cleverly written.This film deserves its high score. The performances are strong, even in their moments of restraint. Rosamund Pike has cited Sharon Stone in ""Basic Instinct"" as an influence and it is noticeable in her sometimes measured manner. Ben Affleck, at times, reminds one of the prototypical Hitchcockian hero-victim.The Reznor and Ross soundtrack is atmospheric, giving the film a suspenseful, unresolved feeling."

The movie had a slow scheme then rising slowly till the end then collapsed with that mess that I felt you were afraid that the days would end before you finish the ending!. I am not trying to have a different opinion about that critically acclaimed movie but really the total scheme flopped from our director who only focused on bringing the wife to the screen with the more than good performance by Rosamund Pike and was a mess in the rest of it even the music didn't add anything to the scenes. Try to understand a complete mess and no entertaining only curiosity what that girl had done before she was gone and what she is doing when that plan had a turn. 6.5/10"

Quite fascinating actually as new evidence surface and with a twist around every corner. The plot literally thickens every step of the way, and gets particularly interesting when the victim's 'fate' is revealed halfway through the film. The stakes then get so much higher! Rosamund Pike was indeed good as the titular gone girl, but I thought Kim Dickens was exceptionally good as Detective Rhonda. I did, however, find the film a bit slow moving, as if I wanted to give it a push at times. The film runs 149 minutes, which I found overlong. Way too many scenes were unnecessarily dragged out.

Back to the film...What starts off as a fairly normal missing persons thriller, quickly becomes something that you least expect. It is extremely faithful to the book, which I always approve of and very little was even left out. Ben Affleck is fantastic and whatever you may have thought/think about him as a person, do not let that cloud your judgement when watching, Gone Girl, as he is really is believable. However it is Rosamund Pike who steals the show as the missing wife. She is just outstanding, really fantastic. There is enough sex, detective work, subplots, good dialogue etc to interest fans of the different components of a thriller, but for me the overall story line is just so perfect that I wonder if it truly ever could have failed as a film.I am currently waiting for my two next favorite books to make it to screen, What Happened to Michael by N F Paupe, who has the equal power of deception and intrigue that Flynn does and , The Dry, by Jane Harper, a book that will explode ( literally) on screen."

Nick is between jobs who spends time with his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) at The Bar playing board games. When Amy goes missing on their fifth anniversary, Nick is less than forthcoming and with clues mounting, they are all pointing at him as a suspect .Part of the film involves the media frenzy surrounding the case.

",0.1027,0.7425,2018-04-18 00:00:00,7,"'Gone Girl (2014)' is a long yet consistently interesting and evolving picture that manages to distance its core characters from the audience just enough so that, though they are still empathetic, our opinions of them are constantly changing with each twist and turn of the tightly-woven and wonderfully layered narrative. It also represents a keen commentary on the vulturous nature of the media in situations such as the one at the core of the story, wherein public conception of both the victim and possible perpetrators is more important than actual evidence or proper investigative journalism.

searingly brilliant performance by her.Good support from Tyler Perry, Carrie Coon and Kim Pickens.Only negatives, I feel, are that the big twist came too soon. I would
like to have been kept in suspense for a while longer. Plus, knowing
Fincher's other work, especially Seven and Fight Club, I was expecting
a big twist near or at the end. When it came it was gradual, and felt a

It's a good whodunit-style mystery which twists and turns throughout and keeps you surprised with some unpredictable moments, but I did find it rather long-winded and suffering from a lack of likeable characters. In Fincher's hands it's an enjoyable film, and it's certain that both Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike rise to the occasion to deliver lots of intense character moments.

The ""Murder Scene"" in a real situation would have been immediately labeled as set up based on blood splatter analysis. 
Where are her recent, 30 day old wounds that caused her to bleed so much? 
How did she get a box cutter if she was constantly tied up in Desi's house?
How did Nicks sister not notice Amy loading her shed up. How did anyone not notice it? 
Where is the CCTV footage from the Casino or Desi's house? 
Why was she allowed to go home while covered in someone else's blood? 
A woman who was captured for weeks and raped, leaves the hospital covered in her ""Captor's"" blood willingly? Nah. 
The feds never bothered to look into her recent spending habits that would literally say ""I am trying to plan my own Murder."" if they did. 
I could keep going, I'm too annoyed by the movies success to bother though.Sure, movies still have holes. It happens. But this movie has more than it should for its level of praise and the holes are so simple."
" Silk Purses and Sow's Ears
",0.0,-0.9985,2018-01-17 00:00:00,5,"When beautiful thirty-something Amy Dunne disappears from her home in North Carthage, Missouri, her husband Nick, a writing teacher at a local college, falls under suspicion of her murder. It quickly transpires that their marriage was not a happy one; Nick was having an affair with a teenage pupil and there are also suggestions that he may have been a reckless spendthrift and a perpetrator of domestic violence. The case arouses considerable media interest, as Amy was the inspiration for a series of popular children's books written by her parents. Although bloodstains are found at the housed, the main weakness in the police case is the absence of a body and the investigating officer, Detective Rhonda Boney, wants to give Nick the benefit of any doubt. When, however, the police uncover Amy's diary, which reveals that she was living in fear of her husband, Nick is arrested and charged with murder. At this point, about halfway through, ""Gone Girl"" appears to be turning into a standard whodunit-cum-courtroom-thriller which will doubtless end with a climactic trial scene in which the truth about Nick's innocence or guilt will be revealed. That, however, is not how the film plays out. Now comes the first in a number of plot twists: Nick is not only innocent of Amy's murder, she has not been murdered at all. She is, in fact, alive and well, having arranged her own disappearance and framed Nick for her murder. (My apologies to those who don't like spoilers. This is the sort of film it is virtually impossible to discuss without writing a spoiler. There are some good things about this film. Rosamund Pike is good as Amy, as is Ben Affleck, an actor who in the past has not always been a favourite of mine, as the hapless Nick. There are some decent supporting performances, especially from Carrie Coon as Nick's twin sister Margo and Kim Dickens as Rhonda. David Fincher handles the direction and there is some effective satire directed at the media which take an obsessive interest in the case and an irrational dislike to Nick, whom they automatically assume to be guilty long before the police have even formally charged him. (In Britain, in order to guarantee a fair trial, we have laws preventing the media from commenting on cases which are still sub judice, but the American courts have always taken the view that such rules would be an impermissible breach of the right to free speech). And yet this is not a good film. It is difficult to make a decent film without a good story, and that is something which ""Gone Girl"" conspicuously lacks. I have never read the novel on which it is based, so do not know how the story would work on the printed page, but it never works on screen. The main problem is that Amy never emerges as a remotely credible character, and the fault lies not with Rosamund Pike but with the way the story is written. Nick is indeed guilty of infidelity, but the other matters of which he is suspected, especially matrimonial violence, turn out to be inventions of Amy who wants to make her diary as damning as possible. If Amy had wanted to punish Nick by obtaining a divorce we could have understood her, even sympathised with her. What we never understand is why she should have conceived so violent a hatred for him that she wanted to see him executed for a murder he never committed, a fate most of us would not wish on our worst enemies. Amy's original plan was to commit suicide, thereby providing the police with the missing piece of evidence, her body, thereby sealing Nick's fate, although it is never explained why she thought that a forensic examination would not reveal that she died by her own hand, thereby securing Nick's acquittal. Nor do we ever understand why she should abruptly abandon this plan and return to the husband she so loathes and despises, explaining away her disappearance as the result of a kidnapping by a jealous ex-boyfriend (whom she has conveniently murdered in the interim). The only plausible explanation is that she is completely deranged, but even as a psychological study of madness the film is never convincing. (If Amy is indeed mad, we never discover how she became mad in the first place). The best actors, and the best director, in the world will never succeed in making a decent film out of a story as badly written as this one. Silk purses and sow's ears come to mind. 5/10"

" A fairly original gripping murder mystery
",-0.5267,0.9674,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Gone Girl' is a hard movie to review - I really don't want to give away too much, because the less you know, the better. I'll say this much - it's a very engrossing mystery/thriller, that's for sure. Certainly lots of twists and turns that keep you guessing and engaged throughout.The main problem is the length - at over two & a half hours, I feel like it could have been wrapped up in a double 'Law & Order'/'CSI'-like episode (i.e. one & a half hours). Sure, it's moody and suspenseful, but it definitely drags at times. The ending is a little ridiculous, but fits with the rest of the film.On the plus-side, the acting is superb, with Affleck & Pike doing the majority of the heavy lifting and truly lending gravitas to their characters. The support cast is also great - Coon as his sister, NPH as the ex-boyfriend, Perry as the lawyer and Dickens as the detective. The Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross score is again ominous and fitting, if a little bland at times."
" Should have been an 8. Let down by the last 30 minutes
",0.0,-0.7929,2017-12-30 00:00:00,6,"Firstly, I would recommend that people watch this film. For the most part it had me hooked with some interesting ideas and nice plot twists. Affleck was good at walking his character along the line between likeable and unlikable (probably because this is the way that Affleck comes across in real life), and Pike's acting was sound until towards the end (which I suspect is more to do with the directing than Pike's acting skills). Sadly, the film was let down by the last 30 minutes, which came across as rushed and/or overly edited. The storyline became totally unbelievable and I was no longer able to suspend my disbelief. Which was a shame because I feel the potential was there. So here are the SPOILERS...These are the plot holes that I took issue with:
1. Why did Amy suddenly lose all ability to be duplicitous when being interviewed by the police when she had managed to ""keep in character"" for months or even years before this?
2. Why did the police/feds not see anything unusual in her behaviour, especially as we had been made to focus so heavily on Nick's behaviour earlier in the film? 
3. Why did the doctors let her return home with her husband so easily when she had said how afraid of him she was?
4. And why, oh why, did Nick stay with her when he knew she had committed murder and tried to get him arrested and killed?!!!I think there would have been scope to justify the last point through Nick's desire to keep the house and bar but this was never effectively conveyed. I also feel that Nick should have been darker in character, which would also have helped justify the end. Ultimately, I really wanted this to be an 8/10 but, alas, I really don't think it is."

Especially if the person planning the attack is considered socially weak, for example, a woman, an elderly person, or a child, no one would doubt it.This film shows how shocking it would be if a person who was regarded as a socially weaker was identified as a sociopath or a psychopath.In the last scene of the movie, it is not a little unreasonable for the wife who returned home to set the case to end without suspicion by the FBI. Because it turned out to be true that her husband, Nick, made statements about amy, and Nick heard about other men who had been set up with amy, but nevertheless the investigators could ignore them."

And the movie had an open ending so we don't know if the case was closed or not. Maybe they will find out about her lies and arrest her. We don't know. That's the point.Instagram @punkifex
" Wonderful, scary, great and so scary
",0.34,0.9898,2017-11-30 00:00:00,9,"I actually stumbled across this movie through Honest Trailers, which I stopped half way through since it looked intriguing and then I went to watch, something I both regret and feel very happy for. Regret because I have dated this girl - not just one of them, several. Okay, none of my psychotic ex:es framed me for murder or rape, but the mindset, the intent, the malevolent way of thinking, that, that I have experienced. So to watch this movie wherein a women take that mindset to the edge is kind of scary, I kept thinking: that could be me. Very happy because this is a great movie. I cannot believe that this is the same Affleck that plays Batman like a tired old rocking chair. Rosamund is amazing, and so are all the supporting cast. Fantastic acting, great story, great directing. This is one of the better movies I have seen that also contain several weird plots and twists. The negative is that when Afflecks characters find out his wife is pregnant, he goes along with it. That felt a bit out of character and I disliked that he cave in, so the end of the movie did not fully work for me. Personally I hoped he would go postal or something, but on the other hand it could be a setup for a sequel? I was also, for some reason, annoyed by the cat. The freaking cat was everywhere, it felt like a plot devise that never happen and I fully expected something to happen with or to it, but it never did. My final complaint is that the police/FBI did not, or at least seemingly not, investigate properly. Come on! A murder that wasn't, a killed rapist by the supposed victim, weird turns, so many clues and an apparent setup and then suddenly the ""murdered"" comes back having killed a guy!? Kind of suspicious times 10, but yea, it sort of made the story... Despite my complaints I give this a 9 out of 10, and I highly recommend."

",0.0,-0.9242,2017-10-28 00:00:00,8,"The movie has had a lot of bad reviews because I presume it wasn't what most viewers were expecting.The movie is very thought provoking in terms of how the media can easily jump to conclusions and how these biases can play into an on going investigation. A lot of movies develop characters and the villain is meant to be a character to be hated. In this movie, you will hate the movie to your core and you will wish something somewhere will happen to this character. Fincher is an amazing director who believes in meticulous details and repeating until perfection. No shot is taken out of place. No cut is too short or too long. If you feel it is, then that's how its supposed to be. If the story is too absurd to believed and people are believing it. Then that's the message he wants to send. I gave this movie an 8 because it inflicted emotions of distress and hatred.Watch this movie on an empty stomach and if you can with your wife/girlfriend (It has to be of the female gender not significant other)"
" Cold and methodical thriller that goes on too long
",0.25,0.9906,2017-10-22 00:00:00,6,"Not having read the book, I experienced 'Gone Girl' cold. And that's pretty much how it left me come the end – cold. Perhaps that was the point but I suspect the ambitions of the film were aiming higher than simply provoking indifference. David Fincher has always been an expressive visual artist, painting sumptuous and richly textured images for us to be enveloped by, but what many of his film experiences lack is heart.Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike give it a good go though, playing a rather unlikable pair that become even more unlikable as the story unfolds. Affleck plays it nice but icy and Pike plays tightly coiled angst, and their relationship retains the interest namely because of the machinations and turns of the plot. It's a good mystery that takes its time to simmer before boiling over a little too much in the final third but it has a couple of devilishly good twists that flip the narrative on its head and play with your perceptions/expectations in extremely interesting ways.However, take away Fincher's visual craftsmanship and you're left with a rather stretched and staggered plot that wobbles under the weight of its own running time. Why so long? I suspect the only real answer to that question is – Gillian Flynn, who adapted her own book and was perhaps a tad overly precious in translating her material to the screen. The result is a bum-numbing 150 mins for a story that only really deserves approximately 110-120 max. This is a thriller after all, not a socio-political epic. Its ending is also so contrived and inexplicable it fails to deliver the sucker punch promised from its first two acts - an ending which I imagine played much better in the book.'Gone Girl' has aspirations of something greater, asking to be taken seriously as an exploration on the nature of the media, celebrity and gender politics but it never really rises above the pot-boiler intrigue of its original source material."

The story is predictable, you know what's gonna happen, but you still want to know how it will go. I had to hold my breath a few times in the movie, and I kind of like it. Having never watched the leading actress in any of her movies before, I was so surprised by her performance. She was so outstanding that she brought all characters up to her level. Even Ben looks great in this movie. You will be amazed and terrified while watching. What's more, it will leave you speechless at the end. Be warned."

The storyline goes from being intelligent and engaging to just plain ridiculous. The second half of the film just jumps from one far-fetched scenario to another, and the big plot twist at the end is frankly absurd.Even without the many plot holes and unanswered questions, a storyline like this was never going to be remotely realistic or believable. I'm afraid the hype around 'Gone Girl' is completely unjust. It tries to be too clever and the end result is an illogical mess of a film. The fact that they ask for two and a half hours of our time with material like this is insulting."

" A Cynical, Masterful Caricature of Modern Relationships
",-0.3818,0.9694,2017-08-01 00:00:00,10,"Amy and Nick Dunne are young, stylish and charming. The immaculate dream couple? It seems so, at least on the face of it. But infidelity and financial troubles let the glamorous façade crumble. One morning, Amy disappears without a trace, and Nick becomes suspect. Did he kill his wife? The media depict him as an uncaring husband, and he's trying desperately to correct that image. But what if he really is the murderer everyone believes him to be?""Gone Girl"", based on the Gillian Flynn novel of the same name, is a masterful thriller, a sharp-sighted media satire and a cynical analysis of modern marriage. Flynn herself wrote the screenplay for the movie adaptation, and David Fincher turns the already disturbing story into something even darker. ""Gone Girl"" is a perfect fit for Fincher, as it is concerned with two of his favorite themes: gender issues and modern media. The main topic here is how the media are shaping our own identities. Nick Dunne has to adapt to the expectations of the public in order to survive. As his lawyer Tanner Bolt puts it: ""This case is about what people think of you.""Amy and Nick both just play a character. They pretend to be a perfect couple. The movie suggests that pretending and being are not as far apart as we tend to think. When everyone plays along, the shallow masks are going to work. The much-maligned ending underlines this insight perfidiously. It's the point where ""Gone Girl"" becomes a pitch-black social satire. The last act isn't a thriller anymore, it's a grotesque caricature of modern relationships. I've never seen anything like it, and I can't praise Fincher enough for the risk he took with the last half an hour of this movie. Ben Affleck is great as the insipid husband Nick. You love to hate him. Rosamund Pike is simply mind-blowing. You'll also see Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry in unusual roles. My personal favorite is Carrie Coon as Nick's caring yet foul-mouthed sister Margo. She's the heart of this movie, because unlike everyone else, she genuinely speaks her mind. Kim Dickens as the clever detective Rhonda Boney is pretty approachable, too.""Gone Girl"" might be Fincher's most splendid masterpiece yet. This movie is so unsettling and cynical, it feels like it was directed by the love child of Alfred Hitchcock and Lars von Trier. If that's not awesome, I don't know what is."

The only thing holding this one back from being on the same level as The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and Fight club is the sometimes fine, most of the time laughable, and always distracting performance from Ben Affleck.

" Gone Girl Goes Potty

After an initially curious beginning 'Gone Girl' then tries to be so 'cleaver' it falls over its own foolishness. It has that look, sound, and feel, of so many other 'deliberately controversial' productions that come and go endlessly. Writer, Gillian Flynn has fashioned a yuppie story - then crammed it with yuppie dialogue, as if trying to outdo the crass situations and vile language of many others that went before this over-baked trendsetter. Her central characters are all unlikable, self-obsessed 'it's all about me' types and much, much worse. Her partner in crime, director David Fincher (House of Cards) attempts to squeeze so much nasty sensationalism into each sequence that it leaves the thinking viewer wanting to run from the room screaming...the whole thing then drags on for almost 2 ½ hrs with barely enough story to cover 80mins max. The too-dumb-for-their-own-good situations and unbelievable grisly murder set-ups are too dark to even write off as black humour – they're simply terrible. Just two examples of foolishness: In these days of endless social media, the 'grieving' husband (and prime suspect) poses for a smiling selfie with a perfect stranger, then says to her ""whatever you do don't show this anywhere""! – weak in the extreme. The wife, who is admitted to Hospital in the midst of a full-on police murder investigation - is let out a day or two later, still covered in blood! Simply laughable. Do audiences check their brains in at the ticket counter when attending these movies?Way too many other vulgar situations in this ugly nonsense to bother with - let alone the lame ending. Don't take my word for it - you will find there are many other reviewers from around the globe who have summed it up perfectly (that is, in between the promotional people, the immoral, and those who just don't want to think)Why did it take so much money? well, as so many others point out: 'you don't know what you're seeing till you've handed over your hard earned money'!"

Quite enjoyed the apathy of Ben Afflec's character, sort of like Francis Underwood (or Urquhart), I was rooting for him despite his rather unappealing personality.

" A David Fincher masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9839,2017-06-13 00:00:00,10,"David Fincher is one of the true masters of modern cinema after more than 20 years in the film business he has proved time and time again that he hasn't lost his steam and with his latest film ""Gone Girl"" is no exception to his excellent body of work as a director. This movie isn't based on a true story but it is based on a novel by Gillian Flynn who also happened to write the screenplay for the film as well, and it is her screenplay that makes the plot during the course of the movie much trickier than the trailers may lead you to believe. Ben Affleck plays Nick Dunne a man whose wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) mysteriously disappears from their home on the day of their 5th wedding anniversary and Nick promptly calls the police to report his wife missing. The police officers investigating the case are Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) and Officer James Gilpin (Patrick Fugit). At first glance the house looks fine but is then promptly turned into a crime scene and Nick becomes the prime suspect in his wife's disappearance, which always happens in these types of cases. Every person in the community is doing anything and everything in their power to help find her. The evidence is very incriminating towards Nick and at the advice of his twin sister Margot (Carrie Coon) he hires a well known defense lawyer named Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry). After Bolt is hired Nick finds Amy's high-school boyfriend who is a man named Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris) and asks him some serious information about his past which I will not reveal in this review. Affleck's performance is what makes this movie so much more riveting, as well as Pike's Oscar nominated work as Amy, along with Flynn's screenplay, Fincher's direction, and the score by ""Nine Inch Nails"" members Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (who won Oscars for Fincher's ""The Social Network"" (2010)). The film is truly great and is also one of the 10 best films of 2014."
" Doesn't do the story justice
",0.5267,0.9961,2017-06-11 00:00:00,7,"I immediately watched Gone Girl after finishing the audio book, which I loved. The characters were so well developed and the plot left you guessing after every chapter. The book has so many scenes that bring the story to life so well. Unfortunately the film is severely lacking the life and energy of the book. The story moves very quickly and doesn't give any time to flesh out the very important plot points that the book establishes so well. As a reader you are hooked on the storytelling of Gone Girl and it pulls you in so well that you feel like your part of the story but when watching the movie you feel like an outsider.One of my biggest issues was the lack of Nicks father in the movie. The book uses him much more heavily and gives Nick so many more layers that make you care about him as a character, the movie doesn't even bring up his relationship with his father.I did find Rosamund Pike's performance as sadistic wife Amy to be fantastic. Just like the book you meet 2 different Amy's. You see diary Amy and crazy Amy. Pike does both characters so well and makes them both so hauntingly believable. I also found Lola Kirke's performance as Greta to be outstanding as well. Both women feel like they are brought straight from the pages and onto the screen, which is what I was looking for.Overall I think Gone Girl is a fine movie that is very well directed and showcases a near perfect performance from Rosamund Pike but I don't think it is the best way to experience a story as good as this. I recommend the book."

Yes, you might say that some parts leave questions about how realistic it is, but that's not what this movie is about and not what the movie should be aiming for. It's about a journey for the viewers, to see what's going to happen next, you should let yourself go and see how a story about insanity is going to unfold. The story is thrilling, even though you might have a clue what would happen in advance, you still long for more, since surprises will follow.

I was astonished by Rosamund Pike's marvelous acting as well. The plot was greatly interpreted by David Fincher even greater than he did in a 1997 The Game film starring Michael Douglas.

" When the 'weaker' sex is strong enough to play the 'weak' card... and win the game...
",0.8591,0.9962,2017-05-18 00:00:00,9,"Voice-over narration that sounds like post-coital whispers, opening credits the size of an ophthalmology screen, non-linear fuzzy editing ""Gone Girl"" isn't just a slow starter, it has an irritating tendency to give you the wrong idea. I can say in all frankness that after twenty minutes, I was contemplating the idea of getting to bed and finishing the film at the morning and the 'performance' of Ben Affleck didn't help. But the story grabbed me enough so I could make it as far as the middle section, and then, all the negative vibes were gone.And not only did I love the film but retrospectively, what I saw as flaws actually made sense and even enhanced the appreciation, and that includes Ben Affleck's performance. We already suspected something was going wrong, quoting Lisa Simpson paraphrasing Churchill, what we had was ""a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma"", if you consider as the ""riddle"" the little game played by Amy, Rosamund Pike in a gusto performance, consisting on leaving many clues to the Police, and a few incriminating ones in the process to accuse her husband Nick, the mystery about her absence and the enigmatic personality of both Amy and Nick, a couple that had everything to be happy, except the propensity for it. Near the end, Nick's lawyer, played by a scene-stealing Tyler Perry, tells his client that they're the most twisted couple he ever met, that's an understatement.But this feeling is also the emotional reward after a build-up that needed to be long, to let the viewers make up their own mind, to be suspicious toward Nick who doesn't seem that upset when she shares his feelings with his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon), to feel that he's hiding something until you understand why his acting was so subdued. This is a man who obviously doesn't play in the league than his wife, she's an intellectual New-Yorker, an uppity Annie-Hall-like broad without the sweetness, he's your average handsome Joe who wanted to get a girl better than him, that he succeeded was a splendid achievement, but what she saw as a beginning, he saw an ending. She followed him to Missouri and realized that marriage was asking too much in terms of sacrifice and compromises to even indulge to it.But instead of filing a divorce and getting the hell out, what she did was far worse, but in terms of creative storytelling, far more intelligent. Indeed, there have been stories of vanishing persons in the past but not as twisted and smartly pervert as David Fincher's ""Gone Girl"". It is twisted almost in the literal sense of the word as there's no plot event to be taken for granted, just when you think this is taking some specific direction, the writers find the right way to derail the plot and increasing your interest. And it is smartly pervert because it highlights some deep and usually repressed aspects of human psyche, to start with the most 'evident' one, giving the film's theme: ""haven't we all dreamed to vanish, at least once?"". I dare any married people to say they never did.People get many notions of suicides mixed up because there's no specific word for that, but there should, speaking for my own personal experience (and yes, I was particularly responsive to the film) and from what many friends shared with them, we, humans, do sometimes wish to simply vanish from existence, become someone else and never coming back. It's a way to escape from the burden of the past, the responsibilities, without any harmful self-infliction, a sort of victim-less suicide. ""Gone Girl"" would have been clever enough to tackle that subject but it goes beyond, this is no victim-less suicide, but a victim-less murder, a woman simulating her disappearance to accuse her husband and earn him a sentence (since this is happening in Missouri). Now, can it get more twisted? Apparently yes, and I like that, I like that a film is hardcore enough to feature one of the most Machiavellian villains of recent history, in the Amazingly manipulative Amy, but the plot doesn't stop at that. Over the course of her diabolical project, she meets a few obstacles but she always have a trick under her sexy sleeve. And Nick is smartly played by Ben Affleck as the not-so-smart cool easy going guy, who married the wrong girl. It's all about a ""He"" and a ""She"" with a ""She"" too sophisticated, too New York for his Midwestern taste, but he wanted his trophy wife and he had to pay for his treacherous seduction. The thing is that this ""He"" and ""She"" don't quite match the general perception of the public and that's how a genius she is. She's strong enough to play the weak card.She knows it's not just about leaving, it's about leaving marks that clearly accuses the husband, traces of blood, hints of pregnancy, a diary, everything is so neatly elaborate that you wish people could be as organized for benevolent reasons. I don't know if it's a personal fetish from Fincher but his movies have the tendency to feature the most beeped up masterminds, from John Doe to Tyler Durden and even counting ""The Game"" corporation, the plans are so far-fetched and yet never ruin their effectiveness whatever the effect. But that Amy one is really one of a kind, she looks a darling for feminists, then she's the total antithesis, by using her intelligence and boobs as weapons.More than ever, our society lies on such polarized perceptions that you can't go beyond what the world wants to see. The woman gets away with everything, which is maybe the way to compensate the blow on feminism it makes, within its own wicked intelligence, it plays fair with the denounced archetypes and I would say about ""Gone Girl"" what I said about ""Indecent Proposal"", it's pure subversive brilliance."

",0.8225,0.8181,2017-05-06 00:00:00,10,"This film is absolutely revolutionary. The cinematography, the score, the directing, the acting, you name it...it is AMAZING!!! Rosamund Pike did a phenomenal job recreating Gillian Flynn's iconic character. No complaints whatsoever. The ""cool girl"" monologue delivered a perfect balance between genius and twisted feminism."
" David Fincher's touch and Gillian Flynn's Script
",0.0,0.981,2017-05-03 00:00:00,7,"'Gone Girl' is a well made movie with David Fincher gracing the movie with his usual style and Gillian Flynn penning a strong script. I have not read the book yet therefore is in a position where I can't really say anything about how different the script is from the book. But the script was decent and manages to juggle the movie's time lines and themes without causing much ruckus.I think Ben Affleck's wooden acting was perfect for this movie and gave his character a very authentic charm to it. Rosamund Pike, on the other hand, transformed herself into the multidimensional character of Amy and gave a brilliant performance. Overall, 'Gone Girl' is a good movie with nothing new to offer but still manages to add a new spin to a movie which basically is about the domestic tensions between a man and his dear wife."
" Definitely NOT the worst movie ever...not the best either..but glad I gave it a chance.
",0.9348,-0.7703,2017-05-01 00:00:00,7,"I understand why people didn't like this movie. There were lots of mistakes. Lots of unanswered questions. A tidied up episode of CSI it's not. But is that the reason we watch movies? For me a good movie is about keeping me captivated, entertained, and I need to feel something for the characters. This movie did that and more. Ben Affleck and Carrie Coon were very convincing as a loving brother and sister. Rosamund Pike's performance as a psychotic killer rivaled Glenn Close's performance in Fatal Attraction. While I would probably not hire Tyler Perry's character to defend me for murder, his performance was a breath of fresh air. And then there is Kim Dickens. She was soooo good as the lead detective on the case, she should have been nominated for an Oscar. I felt for these characters, they captivated me,and I genuinely wanted to know what was going to happen next. And that makes for a good flick in my book. I was disappointed however in how the movie ended. And to elaborate on my earlier comment, there were plenty of plot issues, loose ends, and things that didn't add up. For that it doesn't get a perfect 10. Not even that close to a perfect 10. But I feel sad for people who only like movies if they answers all of their questions. They are missing out."
" Overrated movie
",0.0,0.9633,2017-04-17 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst movie i have ever watched. Zero acting, zero story. I hardly finished the movie at all. Too long for a casual movie, three times i gave up watching it, but i just finished it for its IMDb rating. Just an overrated movie, don't watch it if you just wondering for its score. Go and make some other good things, make love, eat and enjoy your time. Don't kill your time by watching this ****. I don't suggest this movie anyway. Cheers..."
" Awesome Movie
",0.6249,0.9935,2017-03-24 00:00:00,9,"Im not much for thrillers, but this movie was so well written and the casting was awesome that i must say it's great. Ben Affleck is quite good, and Rosamund Pike is great. The whole plot keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat. Overall, a great movie. I highly recommend! Great to watch with significant other, not so much for families."
" Misunderstood
",-0.34,-0.8642,2017-03-22 00:00:00,8,"I've read a lot of user reviews of this movie which give it a score of one out of ten and sight numerous plot holes as the reason. I believe that all these people are mistaken in their assessment. The point is, the fact that the story that Amy Dunne tells the police when she finally comes back is full of holes is intentional. The crime scene at the start of the movie was meant to be poor. The whole way through the film, Nick Dunne feels like he's going crazy because it seems no one else can see these holes. I think it's meant to be a striking commentary on how the mass media and mob mentality can molded to believe any story regardless of the facts present. Nick even says at one point: 'They disliked me, they liked me. They hated me and now they love me.' That line sets the tone of the thinking of the people and the story being constructed by the media. It's a very well made movie. I've always enjoyed David Fincher's work but I'm sad to say I think many people missed the point of this movie."
" Boring, Ridiculous and Shallow
",-0.5859,-0.9825,2017-03-07 00:00:00,1,"I read the book and absolutely despised it, mostly for its cookie-cutter characters and the bizarre overuse of sexual dialogue coupled with an incredulous mystery that was more silly than engaging. I was hoping maybe the film would be a bit of an improvement but nope, not a bit. If anything the film is worse. Too many long, dull and badly-lit shots, too many stupid and weird lines (""cool girl presents her mouth for f*cking and shaves her p*ssy"", what the hell?? Now there's one quote that you won't see up there on the 100 Best Quotes Times Magazine List!), too many characters who you wanted to strangle, from the psychopathic yet pathetic wife to the whiny busybody nerd friend. A serious lack of imagination and a serious injection of pretentiousness that just comes across as very annoying more than stylish. Somehow this waste of Kodachrome (or whatever film stock they used for it) has an 8.1/10 rating, higher than masterpieces like ""The Killing Fields"" (1984) and ""Christine"" (2016)? How on earth did that happen? Is the review system rigged? If not completely horrible, Gone Girl is at best terribly overrated. I was not a fan of most of the actors' jobs in this although I think they were just trying to work with whatever material there was. The soundtrack is totally unmemorable and boringly flat, as flat as the characters and scenery. Gone Girl could have been something better than this, but it tried too hard to be profound and ended up just coming off as shallow, petty and pointless."

" Captures Most Of The Book's Bizarre Mystery
",-0.3182,0.9105,2017-03-01 00:00:00,7,"Its a little tough for me to watch/review ""Gone Girl"" seeing as how I had already read the book. For a plot that relies heavily on surprise and misdirection, I already knew what was going to happen, and that obviously makes it a different viewing experience. I was very impressed, however, by how the film was able to capture the basic essence of the Gillian Flynn novel (maybe it helped that Flynn wrote the screenplay herself!).For a basic plot summary, ""Gone Girl"" tells the story of Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike). One day, Nick comes home and finds his home a crime scene and his wife gone. Lead investigator Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) immediately suspects Nick, whose Ivy League nature and shadowy past make him seem like a viable candidate for the crime. Despite initial support from sister Margo (Carrie Coon) and Amy's parents (played by David Clennon & Lisa Banes), the case against Nick seems to keep getting worse and worse. Could he really have killed his wife?This movie excels in a number of different areas. Flynn is able to seamlessly move the plot from book to screen (no easy task) while still retaining its creepy nature and haunting themes. The casting is also spot-on. Affleck is playing practically the role he was born for (good-looking suave guy who may just be a complete slimeball) and Pike is similarly perfect in her own way. I can see why this one was nominated for a number of Academy Awards.Of course, probably the hallmark of ""Gone Girl"" is that besides spinning a great mystery, it also provides some subtle (or not-so-subtle) commentary on the institution of marriage. I wish I could say more, but to do so would be the ruin the surprises for those who haven't seen it yet. For lovers or young newlyweds watching this movie, I can easily see it producing either deep conversation or very awkward moments.Why not a five-star rating? Well, my exact ranking would be 4.5 stars. I have to go the other direction, however, primarily because I HAVE read the book previously. If there is one thing that doesn't transfer over it is a little bit of the deep commentary on relationships in general. ""Gone Girl"" is a psychological thriller, so some of that is probably better examined in the slower pace of the novel. While reading the book, I was completely sucked in and entranced. Most of that carried over into this film, but not necessarily ALL of it.Of course, I can easily see someone who doesn't know the plot ranking this a five-star effort all the way. It manages to tell an individual mystery filled with over-arching themes about relationships and marriage. A truly haunting tale."

I was really happy with the casting choices and how it follows the plot of the book so closely. Also, round of applause to Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike who kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie even though I already knew what was going to happen. You could tell they put a lot of hard work into it and they both fully embraced their characters and it payed off. It has a pretty long screen time of 145 minutes but it doesn't drag for a minute. I definitely think this is one of the better movie I have seen recently and would recommend."
" Totally disappointed
",-0.5256,-0.6735,2017-02-15 00:00:00,2,"Gone Girl is supposed to be a mystery/thriller but does not fit into the genre. If fails at the first premise of a thriller - the plot's not serious and it insults the viewers' intelligence. *Spoilers* Police officers who investigate the disappearance of the leading female character (Amy) don't strictly follow the usual criminal procedure. For example, there were forensic experts at the ""crime scene"", that is, in the house of the Dunnes, but they didn't immediately search surrounding sheds or the garage. The prime suspect (Amy's husband) was allowed to enter and exit the house whenever he wanted,even after the police had found out the kitchen floor, which everyone was walking across the previous day, was covered in blood. The middle part of the film gives the viewers a very interesting plot twist. The focus changes from a ""guilty"" husband to an intelligent, revenge-seeking and deranged wife.As Amy put it ""I'm so much happier now that I'm dead"". Amy had a plan to frame her husband and her wit and ideas are quite entertaining. In my opinion this should be enough to bring this film to an end. Unfortunately, the story becomes silly and subplots completely redundant at this point. Why the scene when Amy smashed her cheek bone with a hammer? Why did she naively drop the money bag behind the motel?, Why was the character of the stalking Mr Collings even introduced - to bring more crazy and psychotic creatures to the film?, Why was Amy covered in blood during the talk to the police?, Why did Amy's husband stay with her? I think it would have been better if the film hadn't got lost in the surreality. The average viewer can't help him/herself from counting plot holes."
" Interesting movie, but as a movie, not something realistic!
",0.2828,0.9862,2017-02-02 00:00:00,9,"I love this movie, because it made me think! I think the author of the book is tremendous, and this has some great one liners in it. However it is a movie, and someone with a Harvard degree would not kill her self because your first pick of a husband was bad! What makes the movie interesting is how clever and well written it is, thanks to the book and writer. But it is not a plausible reason. If Amy has everything in her name and all the money, she just moves on! Amy's situation happens to many women, but that is because they have nothing, no money at all! In real life this would never happen! Amy would just leave and with her Harvard degree, find a better husband. I do not think she really loved Nick, she just wanted in the end to make his life hell, and nothing else.I love the clever writing but no attractive Ivy league graduated woman would ever do this!"
" Did not see it coming
",0.0,0.8141,2017-01-31 00:00:00,8,"Nick and Amy Dunne, two struggling writers slash journalists, used to be madly in love. Theirs was a dream marriage, two soulmates who had found one another. In their own words they were so cute you wanted to punch them. But that was in the past. Then Nick's mother got sick and they had to move back to his home town in the middle of nowhere. Now Nick owns a bar bought with her money, she's a loner in the neighbourhood and their relationship has gotten progressively worse. And then she disappears on their anniversary and he becomes the main suspect.Gone Girl was directed by the legendary David Fincher, the man behind Se7en and Fight Club, and it shows. He has moved from the have-nots of the society to the haves, but it's still very clearly his style and skill behind the camera. Every scene is filled with meaning and every scene has tension behind it. Almost like there's always something just behind the counter. You're constantly expecting the pin to fall, for something to go for your throat, for something to happen. And for a psychological thriller, that's a great feeling. And the film in no way disappoints. I absolutely don't want to spoil the plot to you, but trust me when I say that it's going to take you for a ride. There are so many rug pulls in this movie that it'll leave you spinning.That being said, I do think that the first third of the film is a bit tedious. You get to know the people involved, there's some backstory told well enough and the initial setup is revealed, but the movie really takes off only after the twist at the start of the second act. Before that you're always wondering where the film is going and whether something is going to happen, but not in a good way. It keeps you waiting too long. It doesn't ruin the film, but it definitely tests your patience.Still, the second act more than makes up for it, leaving us with a great if perhaps a tad flawed film from Fincher. Not his best film by any means, but definitely worth a watch for all his fans."

The feasibility of the characters is good until then. The ending was ridiculous, I can't believe people suspended disbelief this much. It's one thing to have to suspend disbelief, but the characters at the end are completely unbelievable. Affleck's character would definitely not have stayed with a psychopathic murdering partner. Just ridiculous.I am astounded other people are OK with the ending. That's the biggest surprise in all of this. Anyone who knows anything about legal issues or psychology will realise how stupid the ending is. I can only think that some people are ignorant to think it's a good ending! Sorry, but that's my opinion. Just awful. Watch it, and then make up a better ending with your friends (maybe that's worth doing for fun!?)."
" Overrated nonsensical melodrama
",0.0,0.4018,2017-01-18 00:00:00,1,"This movie was on TV this evening and I decided to watch it partly because it has a reputation as a decent film, and partly because there was a joke that referenced it on ""You're The Worst"" this season and I wanted to get the backstory.Since it was on regular TV, it was obvious that some bits had been cut out and some dialog had been changed to get around the R rating, but I'm pretty sure I got the gist of it. And it baffles me that anyone thought this was a great movie.Others have done a great job of pointing out all the plot holes here on IMDb (as I did to my wife while watching it), but not many have mentioned how over-the-top melodramatic the story and acting were (as my wife did to me several times while watching it), to the point of near self-parody.Speaking of the plot holes (SPOILER ALERT), I'll just mention that my favorite is that the wife is DRENCHED in blood after killing her ""alibi"", drives all the way home that way (without calling for help), is taken to the hospital, examined by doctors, sedated, questioned by the FBI and police and taken home again...and is STILL drenched in blood, finally showering it off at home what must have been hours later. What the heck? How was that supposed to be even remotely believable?But maybe, just maybe, despite all that I could have found it in my heart to give this a 5 or 6 rating (after all, it did help kill three hours of an otherwise dull evening), IF IT HAD HAD SOME KIND OF ENDING. Seriously, I was really curious about how they were going to resolve this whole thing - I expected either the husband to kill the wife or vice versa, but nope. Affleck's character decides to just live fearfully and suspiciously ever after with his psycho wife, roll credits. Wow, what an anticlimax.The movie probably still deserves a 3 or 4, but I'm going with 1 just to try to bring its ridiculous 8.4 average down a bit."
" Disturbing and overwrought
",-0.5106,-0.8722,2017-01-18 00:00:00,8,"Right on the occasion of their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) finds that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), has gone missing under suspicious circumstances. The police's attention soon turns to the husband just as the high-profile case turns into a media circus that uncovers dark secrets about a seemingly perfect marriage.While Fincher's direction is no doubt stylish, Gone Girl plays out a little too long for the ""urban myth"" type of thriller that is ends up being. A thought-provoking start turns into sheer shock as characters become harder and harder to sympathize with. The very convincing acting can't make up for an implausible and macabre script that made the movie a disappointment in my eyes. All it manages to achieve in matters of leaving the viewer petrified is lost in a contrived plot and an overindulgent runtime.6/10"
" Haunting look into what people are capable of......
",0.128,0.953,2017-01-12 00:00:00,9,"What..... did I just watch? So Ill start out by saying that THIS should have been movie of the year. It should have cleaned house, not Birdman. David Fincher rarely ever disappoints. The cinematography had an overwhelming dark and creepy feel to it. The plot was rich and suspenseful. Not only was I surprisingly impressed with Ben Affleck in this film but the entire supporting cast did a tremendous job of selling this tense set of circumstances. A great insight into a twisted mind and the things people are capable of. Although it was long, ""Gone Girl"" will take you on a roller coaster ride that keeps you engaged and constantly guessing. I'm going to give ""Gone Girl"" a solid 9/10."
" Not that bad
",0.431,0.9088,2017-01-10 00:00:00,8,"I see sooo many negative reviews regarding this film and I get the point. How that there is so many parts which does not make sense. But i just wanna say that there is obviously flaws in most schemes you plot. Amy is portrayed smart and psychotic but it does not mean that she is soooo brilliant that she can come up with a plot which is flawless and make sense to all the audience. The film clearly shows how there is pressure from the society and how much people loves Amy. Police looks at evidence when they investigate a case. Furthermore, they are just town officers. You cant really expect them to deep dive into the case when all of the evidence present are pointing towards Nick. However I don't like any of the characters and they make me so annoyed."
" Movie that lost control
",-0.3182,-0.9598,2017-01-06 00:00:00,4,"What is wrong when you have a movie which have a great budget, good actors, really great performances (Carrie Coon especially), good sound, skillful directing, but still you barely succeed to watch it till the end? The plot is wrong. And in this case, terrible wrong. Most likely, the producers, even Fincher, couldn't resist to pander to the contemporary taste of a mainstream consumer. I must say that I didn't read a book upon which the film is made, but I can't get the feeling that the ""more and more and more approach"", the aspiration to make a movie which would be unique, finally lead to completely flawed structure. The beginning is fine, and all of the goods is in that part, even with some pretentious tryouts of a Rosamund Pike character to be mysterious and special.But from the middle, movie simply loses control, looking like that there is no clear picture how to get away from over dramatization. At that part, the plot shows all of the weaknesses, bringing many childish mistakes some of the reviewers already pointed out.Finally, having this movie so highly rated, in comparison wit for example Fatal Attraction or Basic Instinct is just ridiculous. Which once again, shows how problematic the IMDb rating can be."
