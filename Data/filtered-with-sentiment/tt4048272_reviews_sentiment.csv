",0.5927,0.9834,2020-10-11 00:00:00,8,"Toni Erdman (2016) - Directed By Maren AdeThe 21st Century could be unkind to the film industry with changes in technology, attitudes and changing paradigms, so film-makers have thrown down the gauntlet and said, ""we accept that challenge"". For those who like normal stories with real-world implications, but at least involve family drama or dysfunction, this is a film for you.Basically a business woman, Ines (Sandra Hüller), has to deal with her estranged father, Winfried (Peter Simonischek), who loves to roll-play as other people and enjoys being a practical joker, while she is also trying to continue her career as a corporate strategist. He is upset that she works too much. She is annoyed with the jokes and fake teeth. He manages to convince people that he is her boss' life coach, Toni Erdman. This is a comedy-drama from Germany that takes place mostly in Bucharest. There are subtitles, but they tend to switch off to English a lot in this film, which is driven by the business aspect of this film.For myself, I felt the film was good and entertaining. Foreign films are always interesting, because you are guaranteed a different perspective than the one you usually would expect. The comedy is smart and at the same time playful and this film doesn't try hard to make the contrast between comedy and drama too wide. They don't try to make you laugh and in the next shot/scene try to make you depressed. Everything is laid out nicely and evenly. The only problem I had was the 2:45 run-time. It did create some drag in the film.8.7 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB"
" C'mon, what a nonsense ...
",-0.4019,0.7685,2020-07-29 00:00:00,4,"Having waited for this movie to appear in my collection, I am aghast.
With German being my native tongue and being brought up there, you can't quarrel about culture differences.
For those years of this movie being in existence, it was tautet ""A Successful German Comedy"". Almost three hours, and I couldn't laugh, some broad grins in between, yes, but that was all. A first hour of depression, then becoming somewhat lighter. Only to be distorted by a fake, spoiled, sex scene. No, not funny. Monty Pythons funniest joke of world history. No, this is not funny.
And so it drags on until some late end, which rather befitted a drama.The whole setup is a raw mixture of one drama about a near sick career-minded woman, with occasional sprinkles of amusement intertwined. And not even the drama unfolds like one might expect it to. An open end with a daughter closer to her father. A mediocre drama plot with sub-average comedy remains just that: a mediocre drama plot with sub-average comedy.But let's not make it all bad: acting. Remarkable, if not exceptional, acting. Peter Simonischek. Sandra Hüller at least very remarkable. Congratulations!
Maybe this is only me, but I don't usually watch movies just to enjoy good acting. And there isn't much more in this movie.
In a nutshell: avoid it if you can."

" an odd father and daughter couple
",-0.3182,-0.8948,2020-04-03 00:00:00,8,"It took four years after the premiere and a pandemic to take over the world for me to get to see 'Toni Erdmann', the German film written and directed in 2016 by Maren Ade, a film that surprised the film industry and left little world indifferent. Many have loved this film, found it original and discovered its cinematic and emotional qualities. There were, however, quite a few spectators who came out disappointed by the viewing, and wondered aloud why so much noise is being made around him. My impression after this relatively late viewing is very clear on the side of those who loved this movie, but I think I can understand the reservations of others.The story of 'Toni Erdmann' seems to have been told several times and the theme of the film is familiar to Hollywood and European art film makers. A father at the retirement age has an uncomfortable relationship with his daughter, a super-efficient corporate consultant. He visits her unexpectedly in the neo-capitalist Romania where she works, and discovers that the girl's life is wasted between endless hours spent in business meetings and the surrogates of life typical to young professionals engaged in business (receptions, restaurants, team-building, sex without love, occasionally drugs). The father's attempts to draw her attention to the trifles that make life worth living are in dissonance with the daughter's ambitions and lifestyle. The road to the living core of her soul and to the true feelings is barred by several carapaces that must be pierced and artificial wrapping and clothes that must be abandoned (some of them literally).The originality of this film lies in the way the story is told and the way it is interpreted, especially by the actor who plays the main role. Peter Simonischek has neither the charisma of a Gérard Depardieu nor the innocence of a Tom Hanks, and his presence in the company offices or at the receptions at which his daughter drags him seems permanently dissonant. Yet, he still accepted - because of the politeness of Romanians to strangers or because of social conveniences. In fact, the only thing that interests him is to reach the heart of his daughter, played by Sandra Hüller with a mixture of loneliness and false self-confidence. It is a paternal love story and a social, but especially moral, criticism of the capitalist environment and of the so-called corporate culture, and of their effects on those who sell their souls for careers in this environment. The dialogues written by Maren Ade and the way in which she sets the story, including the credible description of the Romanian background in which most of the action takes place, manage to make the film go beyond the level of a moralizing melodrama and create a movie with two characters from two different generations, who stay with us after the viewing."
" Yeah, I don't get it
",0.296,-0.9497,2020-03-12 00:00:00,3,"Toni Erdmann is a German comedy about a lonely father who decides to try and insert himself into his daughter's busy life. I don't know if I can say much more about this film because I didn't get it. There's something about the German sense of humor, or something in the tone of the film that simply would not register with me. I could tell they were attempting comedy, but I struggled to see where the jokes were hiding. I was wavering back and forth between thinking the father was just joking around, and thinking the father is struggling with some kind of mental disorder. His constant insistence on ruining his daughter's life was infuriating, and I couldn't understand why so many people were acting like there was nothing wrong with him being there. I also couldn't tell whether the daughter was amused by his behavior or infuriated by it. That's what I mean when I say that I didn't ""get"" Toni Erdmann, it's a comedy that runs on a wavelength I couldn't tap into no matter how hard I tried.Perhaps humor is one of those things that doesn't translate as smoothly to different languages. I can sense sarcasm, irony, and other things in someone's speech pattern. However, when I'm restricted to reading the subtitles, some of the inflection and emotion is lost on me. Also, there are cultural differences that I don't totally understand, which hurts the attempts at comedy. All of this being said, I don't suspect I would enjoy this film much even if it wasn't foreign to me. The uncomfortable situations bother me, and the father who expresses his love through these actions is frustrating. One thing I can absolutely say for sure is that Toni Erdmann is way too long. The pacing of the entire film is plodding, and there are many times it felt like they were lingering in scenes that could have ended 10 minutes ago. To stretch this story out for more than 160 minutes is obscene. Needless to say, I did not like Toni Erdmann. But if you are able to ""get it,"" then your mileage may vary."
" Just about the worst movie I have ever seen
",-0.6249,-0.4105,2020-01-22 00:00:00,1,"Normally I am a cheerful, patient and relaxed person, but when when speaking about this movie I am almost fuming.
Never ever have I been so tempted to run out of the cinema after 20 minutes.
2 hour of complete waste of time - I'd rather hatch a painted wall dry than see this hideous film again.
It is not funny, acting is not very good ( now I am polite), no interesting plot, the best thing about this movie: It finally ended.
This is the most overrated movie in the history of motion picture phoography.
'Plan 9 from outer speace' is a true master piece compared to this awfull peice of 'art'.
It is so sad that we cannot give negative ratings."
" German, 160 minutes. What can possibly go wrong!
",-0.5255,0.8229,2019-10-10 00:00:00,6,"Interesting German language (mixed with English) was different.
The running time of some 160 minutes was a bit excessive and could have been reduced with some decent editing.The film basically tells the story of German Wilfried, a washed up middle aged schoolteacher come divorcee who spends the entire film trying to develop a relationship with his work obsessed daughter Ines.He is a bit sad really, using practical jokes, disguises and ending up in several set pieces that are quite funny individually but for 160 minutes? I beg to differ!The premise is quite good but the execution is a bit time consuming.The title Toni Erdmann comes from one of Wilfried's alter egos when he is in disguise as a supposed German ambassador in Romania. Don't ask.These foreign language films especially so long in duration have some useful scenes but can become quite tiresome."
" Exceptionally funny

" Nice story
",0.4215,0.674,2019-03-28 00:00:00,9,"I liked that the story had an impact. Usually this is happening, the kids are so concentrated on work and carriers that they don't have any time for parents or just to live their lives. For me was an weak up call, on how we try to push the parents back, but doesn't mater what we do they will still be there for us even if we push them to recur at stupid things to be with us! The movie conclusion was to appreciate the moments, the small moments that are making happy because we never know when we'll have those!"
" Toni's Weird Man
",-0.1779,-0.7558,2019-02-24 00:00:00,2,"Seriously, WTF.The father's actions in this movie are totally unbelievable, making a mockery of the rest of the film, and turning the whole thing into an excruciating mess.Turned it off after 90 minutes."
" Slightly overhyped - not convincing due to forced portrayal
",-0.6116,-0.3996,2019-01-05 00:00:00,6,"Toni Erdmann, directed by Maren Ade, is about a busy daughter and her caring father. It questions the meaning of life, if you don't live and feel the life anyway. It's watchable, but because of the big hype it disappointed me.Now first of all, I don't like the way this movie is promoted as a comedy everywhere. Yes, the movie contains many satirical dialogues and elements in general, but it's mostly a sad drama.
Sandra Hüller was amazing at portraying Ines. The rest of the cast was decent. A negative issue was the length in relation to the content. It could've been shortened up. Too many scenes were dragging.The biggest negative point I felt was the delivery of the message. The movie portrays the modern world as if everyone is forced into living like Ines. But that's not true and we only saw a peek into Ines' career anyway. Never before economy gave us more freedom. It's our decision, if we choose a longterm balance between work and life or work more in one period to enjoy more in the next period. Hustling and struggling is a big part of a happy life and that's what Toni Erdmann ignores completely."
" Don't lose humor
",0.1139,0.9974,2018-11-26 00:00:00,8,"While I didn't think this film was all that funny, and found the main character more maddening than anything else, it was thought-provoking, realistic, and always interesting. A father desperately wants to stay in his adult daughter's life, resorting to absurdity, corny jokes, and outright intrusion to do so (e.g. hiding in her bedroom closet, showing up at her workplace, meeting her friends, etc). He assumes an alter ego with a set of false teeth and a wig and pushes the limits for what lies he can get away with, but it's never in a mean-spirited way, and it's as if he's trying to stay relevant in a world that has passed his simple ways by.The movie gives us a pretty pessimistic view of finding a work/life balance in the two extremes it shows us; the father (Peter Simonischek) has little ambition and is a bit of an oaf, and the daughter (Sandra Hüller) works in the soul-numbing capacity of devising corporate strategies to outsource work overseas. The best parts of the film for me were in the depiction of corporate life - the politics, the 'big presentation', the schmoozing, and the clear stratification of those in this world (and at the top of this world) with common people. In one fantastic moment Hüller looks out of a high-rise office window and down at people living in poverty. In another, when commenting on having to take an executive's wife out shopping in order to be on his good side, she quips ""It's Europe's largest mall and no one has money to buy anything."" The scene where father and daughter visit workers in the country and he inadvertently gets one fired is also powerful. How disheartening is it to hear her reaction: ""That's up to him; the more he fires, the fewer I have to fire."" We contrast this with the kindness and dignity shown by these people, inviting him into their home when he needs to use the bathroom, and giving him a sack of apples.The film seems to be putting two things side by side - how the innocent moments of childhood slip away in one's life, and also, in a larger sense, how we've let something else slip away - our humanity.Unfortunately, it gives us a seriously disgusting sex scene in a hotel room involving petit fours that frankly I wish I could un-see. It probably has a point on top of the shock value, something along the lines of how tawdry and non-erotic an affair may be, or how we see her dominate others after having to be submissive to superiors at work, passing along the dehumanization - but I wish this scene would have been excised. On the other hand, I suppose in moments like this, Hüller belting out Whitney Houston's ""Greatest Love of All"" in front of a houseful of strangers, and her impromptu 'naked party' with co-workers, the film keeps us engaged by not having any idea what's going to happen next. There is an absurdity to it all, and maybe the father's advice ""Don't lose humor"" - don't take things too seriously - is the best coping strategy to life, which is too short and often depressing.Another beautiful scene in the film comes at the end, when the father explains how fleeting moments from her childhood float up into his mind, and how he wishes those moments could be held on to somehow - and yet, despite that realization, misses a moment in the present by going off to search for a camera in the attempt to capture it. It's pitch perfect."
" Neither funny nor interesting
",-0.1218,-0.8042,2018-11-13 00:00:00,1,"A movie in which you feel ashamed for the characters,particularly the father. A total nonsense, no twist, no humor. What is supposed to be funny in this movie? The stupid disguise of the father, who actually belongs in an asylum? And if it is not supposed to be funny, what is the purpose of this story?"
" A beautiful story

" One of the best family dramas I've ever watched
",0.6369,0.5208,2018-10-21 00:00:00,9,"We all know how a typical family drama runs. A broken relationship falls into some situation that forced the characters to face the issue, the tension grows to the breaking point, they get to learn something, and in the end it resolved them into a new found love and bond (in case of a comedy) or leaves them totally disillusioned and break away from each other (in case of a tragedy). Americans have championed this genre and set the rules we all know, whether we love it or hate it. But here comes a strange rule breaker from Germany, and it beats them all because it stays, despite of all its absurd and quirky situations, totally realistic at its core.The most prominent emotion through out the film is awkwardness. And no, it's not just because the father doing all sorts of crazy things in his alter-ego, Toni Erdmann. The awkwardness and absurdity dominate everywhere, whether it is a family gathering in Germany or a business meeting in Bucharest. It's essentially because people are all disconnected. It's not that they hate each other or have any ill intentions, but everybody's too afraid to offend anybody, tries too hard to keep the nice facade and fails to share what really matters - even between father and daughter.The ingenuity of the film is how it treats these awkward moments. Most other films, especially when they brand themselves as a comedy, would try to release the tension with a punch line, a big laugh moment before moving onto the next. In Toni Erdmann, we're not given such easy short cut. We are forced to live through these awkward moments stretching out almost to real time and still not given the luxury of releasing the tension. It might be frustrating for some, but one must admit that is much more akin to real life. Who hasn't experienced a discord with family, partner, friends or colleagues, which keeps you sleepless all night and run into awkward reunion with the person stretching into the following morning? There's no such a thing as an easy solution and relief.
Where the father and daughter give a little recital is a high moment of mockery to expectations for such. The choice of song is 'The Greatest Love of All', that is riddled with all the unicorn coloured words like 'children', 'love' and 'dignity' that are 'easy to achieve'. The fact that both father and daughter easily pick it up even on a whim shows that the song represents their shared memory from the past. But despite of that and the optimistic song performed decently by Sandra Huller (considering it's a Whitney song, that is), which would have made the climax in any old American family drama, fails to create that magic moment of 'I love you, dad', 'I love you too, princess'.But it's not all in vain. Because the father dares to break into his daughter's life, and because the daughter decides, however reluctantly, to go along with it, she learns that he really cares and he her life is much more than the gleaming shopping malls and black business suits. So when it finally comes to the moment, after time after time just seeing the other walking away from a distance in the course of this long awkward journey, when the daughter catches him up and falls into his arms, that short and still awkward hug between the naked daughter and the father in a giant furry costume, strikes your heart so much harder.When they reunite at the grandma's funeral, nothing much is changed. The social gathering is as shallow as ever, and the father and daughter cut out still an awkward picture together. 'Toni Erdmann' is stubbornly refuses to give us an easy (thus unrealistic) satisfaction to the very last second of its looong journey. Yet, having joined their journey, we can tell they won't now at least blindly complain, 'Oh, he (she) knows nothing!'. And when the time comes when the daughter remembers her father in the future, it would be those few days she lived with Toni Erdmann that she is going to relive time after time."
" Watch this, not the upcoming remake
",0.0,0.9752,2018-10-20 00:00:00,9,"Toni Erdmann. Fancy an almost 3 hour German comedy? No, I didn't either. A film about a father struggling to connect with his daughter so he ends up infiltrating her business world with his alter-ego, Toni Erdmann. Still not grabbed you? No, I wasn't convinced by the premise either. But....... I laughed so much I cried - on many occasions. But behind all the laughter there was an undercurrent of poignancy - tears of laughter could easily become tears of sadness. I'd say it was a tragi-comedy - I'm not really sure what that is - but think Frank (starring Michael Fassbender). I absolutely loved it. I thought there was still a good hour left and thought this would be a great place to end - and it ended. I couldn't believe I had been watching for nearly 3 hours.

There are couple of memorable scenes which made me bitter laugh out loud. Singing Whitney Houston and an absolute climax at the naked party are some of the best scenes ever. Movie has this Lost In Translation atmosphere where the city of Bucharest is both a medium through which characters interacte and a catalyzer of awkward situations. The film questions family relationships (father senses that life his daughter lives isn't fulfilling), corporate world, cultural and language differences, and above all, society as a whole (""...people are strange when you're a stranger...""). 
Fantastic acting, smart use of real life people which sometimes feels like Borat and brilliant writing. Thumbs up!"

The film is very boring, too long, uninteresting characters, for most people the dialogs are moreover not interesting for most viewers. For example: most people will not be interested in conversations about commercial activities of CEO's.
There are some funny moments, yes.....
Really a movie to forget as soon as possible.
It made me glad that Cannes did not give any prize to this movie

It's not a 1 rating like some reviewers are saying. But it's certainly not a 10 either. It's far too long to enable it to get anywhere that kind of rating. There seems to be so many meaningless scenes that could have been trimmed. 
There are certain moments that for me were laugh out loud. Ines played by Sandra Huller is fantastic. It's made me want to see more of her work. 
Talk of an Hollywood remake on here. I can only assume it will be a very very different film. There is no way ever a scene for scene remake would make it out of Hollywood. 
Give the original a go first, it's different!!"
" Strangely Compelling
",-0.0772,0.8554,2018-07-07 00:00:00,7,"After about 10 minutes of it, I came to the conclusion that ""Toni Erdmann"" was a terrible film and wanted to turn it off. But for some reason I kept watching, and kept watching, until suddenly 2+ hours had gone by. After watching, I still kind of think it's a terrible film, but also have an appreciation for the journey it took me on. I can see how some people on get the former experience, so one will have to judge for themselves whether this type of film is their cup of tea. To me, ""Toni Erdmann"" is a film about emptiness. It's about empty people, living empty lives, all striving for something. While there are some solid laugh out loud moments in the film, I actually found it a bit depressing. I think I see too much of my own life and the lives of those around me here. These characters all seem to be desperately striving for something in their lives - to feel something - but all falling short. In that respect, it's one of the most ""modern"" films I've ever seen - a film that really tries to capture the current time we live in. The vast majority of entertainment today tries to take us away to some other place, time, or culture, so this film is remarkable in how it takes on our society dead on. The impression left is not favourable. PS: ""Toni Erdmann"" is quite similar to the Swedish film ""The Square,"" so if you enjoyed one you will likely enjoy the other."
" A decently acted, but rehashed, overlong, boring movie
",-0.4497,-0.138,2018-06-07 00:00:00,4,"I was expecting better from the buzz I heard about it, but this felt like an edgy European version of the ""kooky and infantile oaf teaches sad sophisticates how to laugh"" movie. Except, where American movies tend to amp up the slapstick or stupidity of the characters, here the protagonist just uses awful props, out-of-touch dad humor, and absurdity. The absurdity of the final act does create a handful of moments of suspense, where you genuinely wonder what's going to happen next, but overwhelmingly there's never a payoff. The whole story is just two remarkably inconsiderate people interacting with a host of characters who don't seem to have enough cohesive traits to form their own personalities. I'm sure there is meant be a subtle running commentary on identity, considering the masks, the props, and the nudity, but instead of evoking any poignant reflection, it just induces eye-rolling annoyance. Imagine someone at your work handing you a stop sign and a plastic rose first thing in the morning and telling you to really think about it. The acting and casting are solid, and I suppose I should applaud the effort too, but overall, there's not enough to compel me to watch it again."
" Very Long Slow and Satisfying
",0.4588,0.9621,2018-05-28 00:00:00,6,"Initially I didn't know what to make of this movie and while billed as a comedy, there really isn't much that I found laugh out load funny about it until the last third of the movie. There are lots of awkward moments, that some could find funny, but others will not like them.Most will find this very depressing and will turn it off after the first 60 minutes or so, I nearly did, but thankfully I kept watching and really enjoyed the last third of the movie.As a father I can speak from experience when I say fathers will do anything to make their children happy and this shows through in this movie. I felt the father's whole misguided aim was to connect with his daughter and try to cheer her up. He can see she is very unhappy with her life. He fails most of the time, but continues to try throughout the movie with sometimes interesting and funny results.Overall I found this quite a deep, thoughtful and very German movie.

Despite a lengthy running-time, it's hard to think of a single scene that does not have it's necessary place (well, perhaps except that bizarre moment with a green petit four.)Winfried is an eccentric man who means well but exasperates his family with inappropriate practical jokes - mostly involving his favourite false teeth. Ines is his daughter, a taut woman - she has run out of patience with his antics. And so 'Toni Erdmann' is brought into the world - an insane alter ego, and a final desperate attempt to recover the lost bond between parent and child.As the film progresses the comedy grows more surreal and outlandish, but the emotional drama grows more subtle and powerful. Sublime performances from the two lead actors. The climax of the film is an indescribable birthday party. Viewed in isolation it would still be shocking (and VERY funny) - but the two hour build up transcends the scene into one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen on screen.PURE GENIUS"

In fact it gets worse and worse until there is noting else left to which to object. A total failure. Zero entertainment at all. At all!

" Good overall but sometimes mixed
",0.2382,0.8689,2018-03-20 00:00:00,7,"Ines Conradi (Sandra Huller) is a young German globalist consultant living in Bucharest, Romania. Her job is to assist large corporations to outsource jobs and reduce their labour costs. Winfried (Peter Simonischek) is Ines' father who is near retirement and concerned about how distant and workaholic his daughter has become. To relieve his distress, he ""visits"" her in Bucharest and plays pranks by showing up at Ines' business functions dressed in a bizarre wig and claiming to be ""Toni Erdmann, life coach"".""Toni Erdmann"" is yet another film where I liked the first half better than the second. The beginning section has many genuine moments of social awkwardness and it is candid about our modern times as it exposes the foils of workaholism and the deviousness of globalization. In a few scenes, director/writer Maren Ade cleverly juxtaposes the wealth of the globalist foreigners with the poor living circumstances of average Romanians. One scene amazes in showing how the poor can still be generous despite their circumstances.The latter half is filled with buffoonery with occasional laughs (a bizarre birthday brunch was the highlight) but some of the comedy seems silly and inconsistent with the rest of the story. For example, how could ""Toni"" have shown up at Ines' after-work events before she does without any indication she told him where she was going to be?Huller gives a fine performance of a complex, inner-conflicted character. She portrays what could be called a villain: a despised, modern archetype - someone who advances her/his own career while casually destroying the livelihoods of others who are less well-off. Yet, she manages, with the help of Ade, to humanize the role without being apologetic for the career choice. The universal theme of ""lost childhood"" is also well portrayed here in Ines' relationship with Winfried. We get glimpses that she used to be as prankish with him in her early years.Overall, ""Toni Erdmann"" is a good film despite its flaws and its excessive length. Like the recent ""Moonlight"", it is a highly acclaimed film that, for me, reaches much of its potential but not all of it."

We were all there to see the biggest sensation from that year's Cannes festival; we were there to see what was publicized as ""the most original COMEDY of the year"". For the first hour and a half there wasn't even a chuckle anywhere in the audience. During the last 45 minutes there emerged a handful of laughs, with me joining in once. Well, not bad, but not nearly enough for a 2½+ hour movie.It has to be said, that this movie, which opens without any credits, has the ugliest opening shot in memory. It's a naturalistic, haphazardly framed and badly-lit shot of a mundane suburban house front door. The cinematography isn't great at any point of the movie. But this is a character piece, so that's not TOO important. Well, the characters are nice, but hardly memorable. ""Toni Erdmann"" is a story of an aloof father who's big on practical jokes and his uptight corporate daughter. The practical jokes have been called ingenious, but I beg to differ. ""Harold and Maude"", now, there is a movie with ingenious practical jokes. And originality, which ""Toni Erdmann"" only aspires to.The director does manage to weave a believable world, which makes watching the movie pleasant enough, but it is telling, that the movie reaches levity only when nudity is presented. It's an old trick, but ""Toni Erdmann"" makes it work by putting its own spin on it. The last 30 minutes are markedly better and more substantial than the rest of the movie.Other than that I do not understand the supposed charm of this quite pedestrian movie."

The idea and the story were fine but the way it was all put together just didn't work for me. The beginning of the movie was so slow, not setting a good feel for the main action of the movie. My other main issue was the characters. I struggled to connect with either the father or daughter thus taking me out of the movie. While I understand the father was a practical joker I got the feeling more of that he was doing his bits without any thought of the people he was doing them too, thus I just couldn't feel sorry for him. As to his daughter I never felt like I ever could get a handle of just who she was. This of course was not the design of the director so I can see where I failed to fully understand the movie as designed to be seen."

There are so many meaningless but cringe-worthy moments in this film that contribute nothing to the experience. It's quite difficult to empathize with either of the main characters since both essentially waste their time with meaningless, absurd activities. The father's approach to getting closer to his daughter is to interfere in a disturbing manner into her professional consultant life. A spontaneously nude party at the consultant's apartment represents the peak of ridiculousness of this movie since it's totally random, meaningless and the opposite of sensual. Maybe all this movie is trying to show is the utter meaninglessness of modern life. No need to waste precious time on this!"

'Awkward' is the adjective most often applied to the set pieces where Dad turns up in his buck-toothed disguise, an alter ego named Toni Erdmann. It's that cringey, embarrassing humour of The Office, and there are some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments. The first time Dad appears in disguise in a bar had me squealing in delight. The by now infamous party scene is also gut-achingly funny, from the moment our heroine gets stuck in her dress. But the film resists easy labelling as a comedy, as it also has something to say about finding joy is our all-too-short lives, about the attitudes of men to women in work, and about how developed nations view relations with developing countries in our globalised, mobile world. Yes, it's too long, but the director says shortening time was at the length of pace, so perhaps the slow-burn is necessary. I haven't laughed so hard at a film in a long time, and I was moved, startlingly most of all when one of the principals is not even visible. A tremendous achievement, and like nothing else around right now."

The scene where, looking down from the office building in Bucharest, one can see what appear to be Roma people living on the fringes of society sums up the divide between the different sectors of society.Probably the scene that will really stick in people's minds is the party towards the end of the movie. I doubt that's the first time that such a party has taken place, but it is a surprise. It's one of many things that eventually forces Ines to acknowledge her father (complete with his eccentricities). I recommend it.

It's like watching a movie that's focused entirely on the boss from Office Space. The female lead is cold, unlikable, boring, and does not change even to the end of the film. The dad is an utter weirdo and I'm not sure-are we supposed to sympathize with him in some way? He's a creepy loser and none of his jokes are even remotely on point. The only thing I agreed with the female lead is that her dad is a complete deadbeat.That's fine, having lead characters that are boring and unlikable, but the movie drags on and on and on and on. The scenes are incredibly long cuts and serve more to make you squirm in your seat with discomfort, or fall asleep from boredom. It took me 3 tries to finish the film. My wife walked out the first time after the first hour, and I stopped it too because it sucked, even though we had high hopes. It is ABSOLUTELY not a comedy in any way. It is a drama, but not a very good drama. There's kind of a rule of thumb in writing: is this the most interesting part of your character's life?

This movie can take you through a mix of feelings: amusement (personally, i laughed to tears), cringe (as a consequence of ridiculously embarrassing scenes) and sadness (the ho-hum corporate life, with minor peaks of enthusiasm but mostly covered in tiredness and personal isolation).

It's a story with potential but told as dryly and blandly as Ade tells it, this ends up being a rare foreign film where you just can't wait to see a more tightly structured and funny Hollywood remake.There's nothing wrong with Peter Simonischek or Sandra Hüller's central performances as father and daughter duo Winfried and Ines and the two actors are both game to partake in some odd scenarios, from cupcake antics, odd birthday parties to awkward nights out with the girls, but Toni Erdmann has surely hoodwinked people into thinking strange and bizarre is in fact genius at work and while some who like their films cut from the bizarre corner of filmmaking will lap up Toni Erdmann's fondness for the odd, there will be other viewers such as me you don't buy into what Erdmann is selling us.It will be interesting to see how Hollywood tackles the stories untypical nature, but there's enough love flowing for the film around the place that acting legend Jack Nicholson has shunned his retirement plans to appear in the remake as the titular Erdmann while Girls superstar Lena Denham is attached to help work on the script, showcasing that Erdmann has its large portion of fans and few detractors.Final Say – Quite clearly Toni Erdmann wasn't for me and I understand that I will be one of only a few who didn't find this slow, charmless and cold experience that's trying to be an odd yet touching tale of a father and daughter, a sight for sore eyes.For those that get on board the journey of Winfried and his quest to reconnect to his daughter, Toni Erdman will be near 3 hours' worth of quality dramatics with laugh out loud oddness, for the other bewildered few, Toni Erdman is one of last year's most unduly praised experiences.1 cupcake out of 5"

I really was looking forward to seeing it but it turned out to be an absolute nonsensical bore-fest.

Basically Winfried Conradi (Peter Simonischek) is a divorced music teacher, an old-age hippie of sorts, and a passionate prankster. Winifried doesn't see much of his working daughter Ines (Sandra Hüller), pursuing a career as a business consultant, currently posted in Bucharest, Romania, working on an outsourcing project in the oil industry. Following the death of his beloved dog, Winifried travels to Bucharest to pay Ines a surprise visit, he puts on sunglasses and false teeth as a playful disguise, she chooses to ignore him, but later invites him to a business reception at the American Embassy. At the reception, Ines wishes to secure a consulting contract with German oil company CEO Henneberg (Michael Wittenborn), she tries desperately to get his attention, but Henneberg seems more interested in her father. Winifried tells Henneberg he has hired a replacement daughter, as Ines is always busy, to her surprise, she and her father are invited, along with the entourage, for drinks, at the bar Henneberg again brushes off Ines and makes fun of Winfried. After several days, Ines and Winifried struggle to get along, she is consumed with work, getting stressed and oversleeping, and she blames her father for most of it, feeling alienated and unwanted Winifried leaves in a taxi for the airport. Ines continues work as usual, several days later she arranges to meet two girls at a bar, while Ines and her friends, a man approaches, introducing himself as ""Toni Edrmann, clearly it is her father with false teeth and a wig, but she does not let on as the girls politely engage in conversation. Ines is increasingly frustrated and unfilled in both her work and her personal life, but she encounters ""Erdmann"" sporadically at parties and outside the office, she is angry at first with her father, accusing him of trying to ""ruin"" her, but she starts to see the worth of her father's interventions, and plays along with his ruse. ""Erdmann"" accompanies Ines on a night out with her work friends, then joins her at a business meeting, in turn, ""Erdmann"" takes Ines to a Romanian family's Easter party, where he forces her into a reluctant but powerful performance of Whitney Houston's ""Greatest Love of All"", after which she swiftly departs. Back at her flat, Ines is preparing to host a business team-building brunch to celebrate her birthday, but she struggles with her dress and shoes, the doorbell rings, instead of finding a new outfit, she opens the door naked, telling guests that it is a ""naked party"". Each of the guests react differently some leaving in disgust, other self- conscious stripping off, the party becomes increasingly awkward, and Winifried turns up in a full-body Bulgarian kukeri costume, frightening Ines' colleagues, he leaves, but she follows, in the park the father and daughter share a hug, despite the impractical costume. Months later, Ines returns to Germany for the funeral of her grandmother, she explains that she has quit her job in Bucharest and will shortly begin working with McKinsey & Company in Singapore, after the funeral Ines and Winifried spend time in the garden playing with funny hats, and reflecting on the nature of happiness. Also starring Thomas Loibl as Gerald, Trystan Pütter as Tim, Ingrid Bisu as Anca, Hadewych Minis as Tatjana and Lucy Russell as Steph. Simonischek and Hüller are a most interesting father and daughter odd couple, there are some slow bits, and you have to keep up with the switches from foreign language with subtitles and English language, the most memorable moments are the awkward Whitney singing and the naked party, most of the laughs come from the eccentric characters and unpredictability of the ridiculous pranks, an unusual but interesting enough comedy drama.

The tempo and length of this film are just totally unacceptable. To hold the attention of an audience for 100 to 120 minutes requires a much better script, a far deeper analysis of the central theme that the movie tries to address, and certainly if it is to be labeled a ""comedy"", it requires some real ""humor"". This film was tedious, lengthy, shallow in the analysis of the main theme (family relations in a competitive globalized world economy), and totally unconvincing in reflecting the reasonable behavior context of relations between a farther and daughter. The ""in company"" business discussions were just ""gibberish"", and perhaps the only theme that could have saved the film (the only reason why I stayed longer than 45 minutes in the theater) was the opportunity to analyze the ""cultural"" and ""psychological"" adaptation of the ""deprived citizens"" of a former communist system to the materialistic attitudes of citizens from a capitalist system.

" This over-hyped film is one of the biggest disappointments of the year.
",-0.4588,0.8125,2017-05-12 00:00:00,5,"Toni Erdmann was the most-touted film of 2016 not only in all Germany but indeed all of Europe. Unfortunately, the over-hyped Toni Erdmann turned out to be one of the biggest disappointments of the year.Critics and viewers have praised this work from anywhere from downright hilarious and uproariously funny to just very funny. The director herself, however, in a February 2017 interview with the New Zealand Herald, stated ""It isn't a comedy . . .I'm not really sure why people think it is."" I must agree with the director on this point, as I did not smirk, cackle, smile, and damn sure didn't laugh during the seemingly interminable nearly three hour runtime. By the time the female protagonist was wailing out Whitney Houston's ""The Greatest Love of All,"" I was ready to shoot out the screen like a glazed and semi-drug-comatose 1970's Elvis Presley.The reason I am not rating this film lower is because one of its main themes of ""The importance of taking time out from a busy schedule of economically raping underdevloped nations in order to find the humour in life"" is one I personally agree with. Hey, it could be worse, I suppose."
" Not bad, but too long, repetitive
",-0.1469,0.9938,2017-05-03 00:00:00,6,"This film has been lovingly praised by most critics. But it's really not that great, just good, although overly long and repetitive. Its problems are not those of the actors, who for the most part are very, very good at what they are told to do by the director. The main problem is that the film suffers from a static condition; they could have lost at least an hour to make its points.One critic mentioned ""one hilarious scene after another."" Great comedy relies on unpredictability. Each scene with father-as-Toni and daughter is much like the next, relying on the same basis for its humor. Once one gets the joke, future amusement depends on how much the viewer likes the sustained discomfort of daughter and frustration of father. Ultimately, though, an overwhelming sense of sadness prevails (or should, if the viewer is paying attention) as the realization dawns that this relationship will not get better.One thing that the film lacks much of a back story of why these two just don't connect. (Most critics see it as a natural case of child rebelling against parent. That's just too easy.) It's been my experience that if at least one parent views life with an impishness, a bemusement of foibles, then the children are likely to have at least some sense of humor. One wonders if there is some source of resentment that the daughter has, but we aren't told anything of the sort. Most films succeed because the people who we are meant to care about have changed in some way by the end of the movie. Not here. And that means, for all of the father's childishness, he's going to be a much happier person than his daughter, who seems to be destined to be on a sustained bummer.I have been wondering how a German audience reacted. Were they laughing uproariously throughout? My own thoughts on German comedy are these: underdeveloped, with a slightly more sophisticated enjoyment of slapstick (i.e. Laurel and Hardy) than the French (i.e. Jerry Lewis); perhaps unwilling to really let loose (is it okay now to joke around? the habit of keeping the Holocaust in the German public's mind may inhibit); the funniest Germans emigrated or were annihilated; some sources of amusement come at someone else's expense. It is difficult to create a list of Great German Comedies that would not be dwarfed by those produced by the USA, England, France, and Italy.Toward the end, there is a sustained scene of utter preposterousness, as though some comedic Fellini dream sequence suddenly intruded and took over. For me, this did not work at all, and undermined the mood of a sad reality constructed relentlessly over the course of two hours. I would have preferred that the daughter confront her male tormentors in a believable way. As such, it doesn't come off as empowering as much as it does just being a goofy way to say ""sod off""."

Some of the scenes might appear exaggerated and way out of proportion, however I can relate to both character types in extreme situations.It kind of caught me off guard because I didn't realize how long it was going to be. But I didn't feel bored. Neither did I consider it lengthy. It just takes its time to tell a very special story.I grew up learning German. What bothers me about most German movies it that the actors seem to be very focused on what they're saying, about the pronunciation, tone, etc. - however, this always makes German actors sound like - well - actors. Not a single sentence seems natural.This is one of the few movies in which this is not the case.It presents a great view on family, a modern, corporate, global world and modern-day role models and relationships.However, at times it's taking it a little bit too far and made me cringe a little bit too much, which is why I am giving it 7/10.Other than that, I would recommend this movie to anyone who has an attention span that is long enough to appreciate the whole thing."

Maybe if it was trimmed to a neat 90 minutes, but close to 3 hrs. Check it out, tell me if I'm wrong."

On a more serious note: The movie has been lauded so much, that there might be some people already in a defensive position before they watch it. Or maybe they'll have high expectations even before watching the movie. That's all up to the viewer and their mindset of course.Having said all that, the acting is really good and the movie flows along nicely, no matter the bumps in the road and the pacing problems concerning the mood of the movie. The relationships are pretty clear, no matter if you like how things are handled or not. But it's set up pretty early on how the characters work and what they do (what crazy things they are up to and so forth). Be prepared to watch something odd!

In this German film, an apple falls very far from the tree, almost out of the county because daughter Inez is a humorless, stick-up-the-butt corporate apparatchik in contrast with her certifiably insane Dad, practical-joking Winfried, who has practical- joked himself into an old age of isolation and loneliness. Guessing that his stick-butt daughter is as isolated and lonely as he, Winfried pays a visit to her office in Bucharest and, well, you just gotta watch. Things get progressively out-of-hand as daughter, suddenly the apple, tries to match him prank for prank and, you know, you're going to have to answer the door naked to see what happens. Rumor is that Jack Nicholson has been picked for the American version."
" Great acting, but I got really bored
",-0.138,0.8624,2017-03-21 00:00:00,6,"I had great expectations about this movie, perhaps because it was nominated to an Oscar. After watching the film, I wonder why, precisely, it was nominated.The best thing in this movie is the acting, mostly carried out by Sandra Huller and Peter Simonischek, playing father and daughter. Not even for a second I thought they weren't their characters. Great acting, especially taking into account the length and variety of absurd situations the story puts them on. I would say this is a comedy of the absurd blended with an hyper-realist description of a dysfunctional relationship. Some people might find it hilarious, and get the humour. Although I surprised myself with spontaneous bouts of laughter, those moments were very rare. The movie also has some tender and intimate moments between father and daughter, which I really enjoyed, but they were very few as well. Overall, I found the film boring, too long, with an unfocused direction, and a script that seemed not to know where to go, the story only saved by the craftsmanship of the leading actors. One of the things I resented the most was the lack of digging into what really drives the inner life of the characters; the characters are properly built, we know who they are right now, but we don't know what lies underneath, what really drives them, from where they come from.I found myself sleepy, yawning and bored. This was my experience. Yours might be different, if that is the case, good on you :)."
" Toni Erdmann ShowMeTheMovies Review
",0.0,0.9934,2017-03-20 00:00:00,6,"This Oscar-nominated German comedy may have gained favour amongst others, but failed to leave me captivated through its' depiction of politics, pranks and dysfunctional families.The film views a snapshot of the life of Winfried Conradi - a music teacher and life-long prankster who, upon the death of his beloved canine companion, decides to visit his estranged daughter (Ines Conradi, played by Sandra Hüller) in Bucharest for her birthday.. leading to her horror as an alter-ego - 'Toni Erdmann' - begins causing a nuisance at various events as he follows her around (in an attempt to both embarrass and connect with her).The premise of the film - though not riveting - sounds decent enough; a moving father/daughter tale with some jokes lodged in there. The screenplay, though well-written and humorous at times, came across (perhaps purposefully-) awkward and dull - somewhat lacking in that natural fluidity that many alternative comedies manage to achieve. This could be, in part, due to its' long-winded (almost 3 hour) screen-time (not many pictures can pull that off!).Sandra Hüller was actually rather good in her role - though I struggled to want to reach her entry to the film as it started so slowly I could happily have nodded off. Once in full swing, Toni Erdmann was actually quite nicely paced, showing well how irritating, over-bearing and infuriating Winfried makes his daughter (bad-dad dancing doesn't cut it!) who, though softens to him toward the closing credits, really doesn't want her father to be a part of her world.My main compliment here is that it is unashamedly silly whilst contributing some underlining moving, melancholic elements - something popular this season at cinemas (think Manchester by the Sea). Dutch director, Maren Ade, may well have been caught up in the ridiculousness and satire of her whole creation though - which sometimes worked but at other times were left stale.Some fairly good characters and fairly good dialogue, this tragedy/comedy caught me off guard with its' seemingly-uncharacteristically serious elements - as Ines begins to let down her defences, I felt that so did I.Though perhaps a controversial opinion, I can't really say I would give Toni Erdmann the time of day again; not a tragic effort but one best left at one time only viewing. Although I appreciate a foreign language film generating a bit of buzz, and liked their attempt at bringing things back to basics, I couldn't vouch for it past 'it's not bad'.https://showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/"
" A Noble Undertaking
",0.4588,0.489,2017-03-16 00:00:00,7,"I am unsure of how I feel about Toni Erdmann. On the one hand, Toni Erdmann is a film with a huge heart. The premise is simple enough to follow. Essentially, a father (Winfried Conradi), in an existential crisis of sorts, uses an alter ego in order to reconnect with his corporate-driven daughter. The corporation Conradi's daughter works for is as stereotypically capitalistic as it gets. The film utilizes the process of globalization and corporate culture as a means to amplify the disconnect in the father/daughter relationship. The viewer gets the sense Winfriend was a hippie back in the day. Toni Erdmann often works because the characters are extremely complex. I enjoy films in which the characters exist without an explicit concern for audience expectations. Primary or secondary characters often ramble about subjects which are not necessarily tied to the main narrative. In these moments, the camera will focus on setting up characters in the background or illustrate the state of the speaker's mind. The fictional events on screen are shown to be natural slices of life. Conradi is only predictable in that he is desperate to reconnect with his daughter, Ines. Often, Conradi as Toni Erdmann resorts to pranks in an attempt to goad out some repressed nature in Ines. Humor organically flows in the awkward situations Erdmann flings into. In short, Toni Erdmann has many moments which are pure comedy gold. The core nature of Toni Erdmann's (the film) humor is laid bare near the film's climax. The faults of Toni Erdmann, unfortunately, stem from some of the films' strengths. As primarily a drama, the humor is inconsistent in where and how long it occurs. The film also allows characters a little too much breathing time. After a key moment, the camera decides it wants to follow the characters around. The argument could be said the choice aides in giving the characters an added depth towards physicality. By physicality, I mean the subtle body languages in a character. However, Toni Erdmann is an almost three-hour affair. A lot of people walked out around the film's halfway point. Personally, I walked out of the theatre wishing the director had opted to cut about thirty minutes. Character development is at times made explicit in narrative exposition. As a result, the extra attention to body language feels a bit redundant. I might be being a little harsh due to my unfamiliarity with German cinema. Ultimately, I think the film was worth my time."
" What a load of rubbish!!
",0.0,0.9198,2017-03-09 00:00:00,1,"Honestly, how can anyone see anything funny or comical in this boring, long-winded film? I wondered if I had been watching a different film from the other so-called critics here and elsewhere, who believe this to be a masterpiece. And why they should ever want to re-make this in American English with, possibly Jack Nicholson in the starring role, is way beyond me. The attempts at humour were childish (around 4 years old) and so drawn- out that you almost fall asleep. The story-line is very weak and the ending!!! Well, I was still sitting there, waiting for the father to come back, when it went all black and the titles rolled. In fact, in retrospect, that was the best part of the film. Oscar nominated? My dog could have done better and he's been dead for 12 years. I had to give a vote of 1 (awful), but in reality the best vote should have been 0."

Winfried is a practical joker who wears false teeth and speaks in funny accents. After a couple of days Winfried starts to show everywhere Inès goes and also ruining her job. It's a performance oriented movie. Both Simonischek and Hüller's performance was equally remarkable and their chemistry also helps the movie in a good way. There is a birthday party in the film towards the end and this is the first time am watching a party like this. This is one of those films in which the punch line is always delayed and offbeat comedy unfolds over a long time. Adé's film never loses its touch and shows the way how parental love can overcome any difficult situation. Overall, it's a must watch for drama movie lovers."
" Entertaining but too long by about an hour
",0.2382,0.4876,2017-03-01 00:00:00,6,"This film has a lot going for it. The central theme, which is the troubled relationship of father and daughter, is set within a fascinating context, the drive to modernise the antiquated Romanian economy with the inevitable cost in layoffs. The two are nicely meshed, with the daughter showing no concern for the human suffering her company is causing while the father develops some rapport with ordinary Romanians despite the language barrier. The vulgarity and conspicuous consumption of the international financial elite are depicted without pulling any punches, and the sexism of corporate culture is nailed. In addition though, there are some very funny moments, and I laughed a lot.At least, I laughed a lot during the first ninety minutes. The problem is that after that the film goes on for another full hour, and I think it loses its way. There is one scene of sexual grossness which adds nothing, and other scenes are frankly preachy. Strangely enough, having been self-indulgent on length, the director doesn't know how to bring the film to an effective end, and there is no clear resolution"
" Wonderful Film

I've never seen a film balance comedy and drama as effectively as this. The film is very serious for the most part, but there were multiple moments where the audience burst into laughter and applause in the middle of the film. I have never seen anything like it. At times it even feels like a low key thriller as you question how far Toni can take his prank before getting caught. Through a world of vapidity and isolation, a crooked smile can make even the worst times seem tolerable."
" Age of alienation
",-0.2732,0.9944,2017-02-28 00:00:00,9,"I was deeply moved by this movie. It shows a spark of comedy in a tragic life. The life that is driven by mere ambitions. And I observe this in real life where people become so distant from each another. If they cannot be an asset, they are useless, they are distraction.We see so often that people/my friends strive to be successful and spend their time of everything else but their family. Especially, parents. 'I don't have time' becomes a slogan of this generation. They visit family members when they are sick or dying or it's too late. This time is not about enjoying the moment. This time seems about chasing something. Chasing nothing.In this film Toni perfectly reveals the absurdity of his daughter's life that is based on illusions as we see that the daughter is suffering behind her successful mask because she cannot get close to anyone. This contrast between the father and the daughter is seen through all the film. He is emotional and thinks about individuals. She is cold, distant and feels shame about her father. But in this film the father is the one who makes sense though he acts like a clown all the time. He makes all this high society look like a bunch of idiots with their small talks and false images. And I loved it.I enjoyed the unexpected moments of this film and the set they used. Romania is an amazing country and a wonderful choice. Credibility was nicely caught. Many episodes were amazing and revealed the fragments of Romanian culture.Actually, I waited for a movie like this and for more films that reveal the false values of our lives. Acting is great! It's a must see!"
" Excruciating, for all the wrong reasons.
",-0.8126,-0.7745,2017-02-27 00:00:00,1,"I cannot emphasise how painful this film was for me to sit through. I had been told that I would be howling with laughter one moment and sobbing with sadness the next. As it was about a father-daughter relationship and I have my own complex and historically fraught relationship with my own daughter, I thought that this might be just the thing I need and that I'd find something I could relate to.I didn't. Nor did I find anything to laugh at. For nearly three hours.I have never, EVER checked my watch so much while watching a film: regularly checking, counting down the time and thinking, for instance, ""It's been an hour, now. Surely something funny has to happen soon?"". But no. Unless you consider someone wearing a wig and false teeth hilarious (and for some reason plenty of people do) then there's not much else in here. Oh, and spunk-topped petit fours. Apparently, these are quite a crowd pleaser.This is one overlong, dreary and tedious film, and I didn't even smile once. The acting is blank, the script sounds as if it were improvised by performers who aren't actually very good at improvising. There is something creepy about the father's stalking of his own daughter, especially when he sneaks into her conveniently unlocked flat and, on hearing her coming, decides to hide in the cupboard. Hilarious. I can only imagine.Awful, awful, awful film. I'm so glad it lost out at the Oscars, and I cannot even think what people see in it."

I had expected there would be slow moments but not that many and not for such lengths at a time. I had also expected more interaction between father and daughter.Still, Toni Erdmann is very special. It's amazing to what great lengths a father will go to help his daughter. I could say there were many unexpected scenes but the fact is, to me, the entire movie was unexpected. Both characters never seemed to do what I thought they would and that was a great feeling.From that opening scene I could see this would be a special movie if only I could stand the slow pace. Even though at the time I kept wondering how long till it was over, the more I think about it the more I like it and think about all the issues subtly approached there.All performances were terrific, even the supporting ones. I am still in awe at the amount of realities portrayed in this movie and how genuine they felt. They spanned cultures, social status, age, etc, etc. And then there are all the other issues addressed, besides the obvious one of whether we are happy. There's work, family and friends relationships; the struggle of a woman to be seen as equal in her workplace; casual relationships, never getting attached; globalisation, outsourcing and everything it entails; what you are willing to do to achieve your goals and so, so much more. It is such a deep movie.I really wish it had been further edited, though. It would have had more of an impact, at least on me."

" So deeply rooted in real emotion it only feels outlandish after its over
",0.0,0.9907,2017-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Truly, a comedy epic. OK, that's mostly the length of the film talking. This is a classic high-concept comedy premise that's so deeply rooted in real human emotion that it only feels outlandish on reflection afterwards.Quite a bit has been said about the way in which the film refuses to conform to the typical route one like this would take - that of a woman finding a man, realizing she's a Type-A corporate bitch who just needs to shut up and be a wife/mom, and all without ever explicitly stating that fact but implying it every step of the way.Instead, this film meanders and wanders and roams and keeps finding ways to surprise and tickle. The jokes are long cons, ones with mostly huge payoffs. That Ines reaches her revelation both as a result of her father's antics and also her own self-realization feels especially real. What she needed was not so much a change of heart but to be surrounded by one decent person. It's the fault of other corporate cronies and sexist buffoons. It is a slight twist on the formula that makes it near revelatory. The ending eschews trite resolution, suggesting that happiness isn't magically forever after some grand realization but that it is comprised of moments and the mere ability to see that and experience that with someone you love is in itself revelation enough.I would have preferred less slack direction in regards to the showy- unshowy ""realism"" camera work and scene pacing. There are some scenes that seem shot for no reason whatsoever and others that end abruptly or at absurdly inconvenient times. In short, it tries to be too cute with its form. I'm thinking in particular of the ending where Ines has a naked brunch (my lord when Toni shows up in that costume - haven't heard an audience laugh like that in while) and hilarity ensues as people show up naked until it ends with a well-timed hand on a shoulder. Suddenly people are putting on clothes and Toni leaves and Ines chases and there's no reason for any of it and the scene still had so much more to give. Then there's a strange long-winded follow-through in a park and a little girl and finally a hotel clerk pulling off a mask. A tighter sense of story there (and elsewhere) and we could be talking masterpiece."

",0.5551,0.9921,2017-02-24 00:00:00,8,"'TONI ERDMAN': Four Stars (Out of Five)The critically acclaimed German-Austrian drama, about a divorced prankster music teacher that tries to reconnect with his business obsessed daughter. It was written and directed by Maren Ade, and it stars Sandra Huller and Peter Simonischek. The film was one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2016, and it was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the upcoming Academy Awards. I enjoyed it quite a bit, despite it being a tad too long (and slow- paced at times).Winfried Conradi (Simonischek) is an older hippie music teacher, that loves playing pranks on people and has been divorced for some time. After his dog dies, he decides he needs to reconnect with his daughter, Ines (Huller). Ines is currently obsessively focused on her job (in Bucharest, Romania). She's also not happy about her father's visit, but he persistently tries to make her warm up to him; through strange pranks, involving many different characters. The movie is very sweet, and quite touching at times. It's also raunchy, and crude at other times too though (so be warned). It's funny, but the film is definitely not a comedy (like some have described it to be). It's a really well developed father and daughter story, and both of the performances are great in it. At over 2 hours and 42 minutes, it's definitely too long though (and some times it's a little too slow-paced); but it's definitely still worth watching, and it's mostly an entertaining watch too. I can't wait for the American remake (that's already in development), with Jack Nicholson and Kristen Wiig (seems like perfect casting to me)!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' review at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ZNHDah5M"
" Compulsive practical joker frees uptight daughter from success
",0.5859,0.9816,2017-02-24 00:00:00,8,"So what's the point of the two most outrageous scenes in Toni Erdmann? In the first, Ines turns a tryst with Tim into her watching him masturbate onto a — green, she specifies — petit-four which she then eats. Finger-licking good. In the second, she decides at the last minute to answer the door naked and require all her friends and work colleagues to strip down if they want to stay for her Sunday birthday brunch. First, both her actions are outrageous. That means she's adopting the manic absurdity of her father, a compulsive practical joker who has donned looney wig and fake teeth to pass as her CEO's life coach, ""Toni Erdmann."" Within that liberation she's stripping off false appearances. The service Ines is trying to sell the Bucharest international is explicitly deception, finding a false front for the company's inhumane conduct in a merger. In the first outrageous scene, a romantic tryst is exposed as not having any romance at all. Ines's Tim is a junior colleague, excluded from key meetings, an attractive callow young man whom she is sexually using — like a confection. By watching him masturbate she admits her detachment from him even in their normal intercourse. Instead of their usual pretence at ""making love"" she is literally using him as a delectable to appease her appetite. Her choice of green pastry may be a nod at her eco consciousness — or a reminder that he is that callow junior, green in judgment. The second episode has her stripping all the veneers of her corporate image including the smart dress that is the social equivalent to her business uniform. The dress she is trying to change at the last minute is too tight to serve. Her father's crazy intervention has revived her own spontaneous spirit — first seen when she responds to his insistence she sing. The too- tight dress reminds her that her professional career, responsibilities, efficiency, pretences, are all restricting her essential impulses and character. The team-building use of her birthday then tests her friends' and colleagues' willingness to take her on her own terms. Her nakedness also confronts them with the sexism clearly revealed in her boss and male clients.So Winfried turns out in fact to be a life coach, if only hers. He is returning his daughter to the free spirit she has suppressed for corporate purposes. He's reviving her individuality and enjoyment of life. He tries to affect the others he meets as well, like the impoverished worker whose side he takes against the corporate expansion with its murderous layoffs, the worker he tries to save from firing, the family gathering he spikes with song. Winfried's very appearance in her life cracks her efficiency and stability. The distraction puts her off her focus. When she catches her foot on the sofa bed she's making up for him, the bruise swells up and later spatters her white blouse with blood, just before a presentation. It's a defloration image, an emblem of her penetration and new consciousness. It sets up the two sexual scenes we're considering. The idea of a two and half-hour German comedy may seem surprising. But the acerbic view of corporate character and strategies and the extremity of the father's and daughter's behaviour provide the Brechtian dynamic of social criticism and critical detachment (Verfremdunkseffekt). ""Erdmann"" has two other European forbears: Renoir's Boudu, a vagrant who disrupts the family and life of the bourgeois bookseller who ""saves"" him from drowning, and the Czech Josef Hasek's Good Soldier Schweik whose fumbling and possibly deliberate — or not — incompetence destroys the organizational structures and formalities around him. In setting German characters in a Rumanian situation director Ms Maren Ade may be reflecting on her nation's outreach into the EU. Winfried evokes a German folk figure unleashed upon the international sophisticates — and firmly unabashed. This German will remain proudly Germanic — especially manic — in whatever cosmopolitan situation he finds himself. And he will violate every decorum to return his daughter to her freer potential as well. Significantly, once liberated from her Bucharest company Ines doesn't return to Germany but takes her show on the road to Singapore."

As the movie opens, we get to know Winfried Conradi, a goofball older guy who is looking for meaning in life. When going to a family party in Aachen, Germany, his grown-up daughter Ines is there, having flown in from Bucharest, where she is works for a consultancy. Days later, out of the blue Winfried decides to visit Ines in Bucharest unannounced. After an awkward weekend, Winfried supposedly leaves, only to return in an alter ego called Toni Erdmann, a ""life coach"", to the exasperation of Ines. What will become of this father-daughter relationship? To tell you more of the plot might spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie comes from up-and-coming German writer-director Maren Ade. In her 3rd feature-long movie, she tackles a complicated father-daughter relationship. Dad wants to make sure his erstwhile little girl but now grown-up woman is doing OK, while Ines simply wants to build her career. Ah yes, the career... While this movie is of course centered on the father-daughter-relationship, the movie also explores corporate culture, and not just as a quick side bar but in extensive sections of the movie. Ines is heading a very important project that may involve extensive outsourcing, and that brings with it a lot of tension within the consultancy team. There are yet further side bars, and I couldn't help but wonder whether they really were needed or deemed critical; given the movie's frankly overly long 2 3/4 hrs. running time. Sandra Hüller as Ines gives nothing short of a towering performance, and given that the movie spends a lot more time with her Ines Conradi character than it does with the Toni Erdmann character, I can't help but wonder why the movie wasn't titled ""Ines Conradi"". Beware, there is extensive nudity in the film, so if that bothers you, check out a different movie instead.""Toni Erdmann"" premiered at last year's Cannes Film Festival, and has been scooping up awards left and right ever since. It is up for Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar this Sunday, and considered the front runner. The movie opened recently at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and the Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great (the upper 70s weather--in February!!--probably had something to do with it). If you are in the mood for a one-of-a-kind father-daughter relationship movie, I encourage you to check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."
" Not as good as the critics make out, could have done with a lot of editing!

I went into Toni Erdmann expecting something like that. What I got instead was a film that was less than the sum of its parts, with awkward, stilted pacing (possibly intentionally), and really variations of one slapstick joke being repeated over and over again. It's not that it's not funny, there are quite a few good laughs there, and it's not that the main character's attempts to reconnect with his daughter are not charming. It's just that those good elements are diluted in many scenes where one or both of the main characters were surrounded by a bunch of other actors just feeling awkward and not knowing what to do with the main characters (repetitive and increasingly unfunny) shenanigans. It just felt like bad film-craft, with really poor chemistry between the actors most of the time. Another thing is (I will spare you the details) the completely gratuitous scenes with sexual content and nudity, which just seemed out of place within the rest of the film, and were there (in my view) just to make the film seem more edgy and challenging. Nothing wrong with edgy and challenging, and nothing wrong with nudity in principle, it's just that these scenes did not work with the rest of the film at all and were far too long, and far too detailed, and one of them did not contribute to the plot at all. In the end, the director's self-indulgence and the lack of chemistry between the two main actors and the rest of the cast just makes it feel like an excuse to put the main character in increasingly unlikely and increasingly awkward situations, that he responds to by playing cheesy gags.

Contrast between quirky, fun-loving and non-pretentious father and his ambitious, sometimes too serious daughter. Development of their relationship and dynamics throughout.The main female character (the daughter). Not the persona, but the way her character is written. In the beginning only a small portion of her life is shown, but somewhere in the middle of the movie, the first impressions of her change, which leaves you even more interested.The main character*s (the father) humor and unexpectedness. A man who is the biggest liar in the film, but somehow the most honest.Funny moments that appear during uncomfortable or serious moments and which catch you off guard.Many other things.What is to mildly dislike (kind of):The usual *it doesn*t feel like an ending* ending. This film could have ended in many different ways and still be believable. This was just one of the possibilities.Not much more."
" A quirky story about the father-daughter bond that is unorthodox and endearing.
",0.0,0.998,2017-02-21 00:00:00,7,"Parent-child conflict is a universal theme that can be spun into an infinite variety of narrative fabrics and colours. For mothers, it is often treated as an angst-ridden melodrama while for fathers it is usually a comedy. Each relationship mix has its own tropes and conventions but the German- Austrian film Toni Erdman (2016) is far from being a genre film. It is a stream of consciousness comedic study of the father-daughter bond that is quirky, insightful and strangely moving.It is hard to imagine a more mismatched duo: Winfried Conradi (Peter Simonischek) is the epitome of the irritating reconstructed divorced hippie father. He lives alone, seemingly half a century behind everyone else, and loves his own 'dad jokes' and clownish antics. When his beloved dog dies, he wants to re-connect with his corporate consultant daughter Ines (Sandra Huller), but his surprise arrival in her city is inauspicious. She barely acknowledges his presence while continuing to do the things that high-potential upwardly mobile young women do to impress and advance their prospects. From here forward, Winfried wants to save his daughter from a shallow heartless career where firing people, ruining lives, and being fluent in corporate-babble gains respect and reward. Like fathers around the world, he slips into and out of comedic personas to embarrass offspring into self-recognition. His chief alter-ego is Toni Erdmann, alternatively a life coach, Ambassador, or businessman, depending on who Ines introduces him to. In each role, he is able to prick her conscience into seeing herself as the sterile human she has become. In one scene, he tells her boss of a venture where you can hire a daughter to replace one who has no time for you, and in another, he disarms her by asking ""are you even human?"". The longer he stays, the more cracks appear in her constructed persona and a softening light peeps through.Within this linear plot line, there are several sub-stories that work as standalone comedic vignettes. Most contribute to the narrative, but some will leave viewers wondering what on earth just happened? The emotionless sexual encounter between Ines and a colleague is fertile ground for feminist analysis; the off-key singing of ""The Greatest Love of All"" by Ines is both poignant and ridiculous; and the naked lunch with a hairy guest monster can only be understood through a Beckett-like absurdist lens. At two hours and forty-two minutes, this film requires faith and patience. The pace is slow and another session in the editing suite would have helped without losing what is good and interesting. Fortunately, the acting performances are excellent, with an almost cameo-like deadpan-realism that is delivered convincingly by its relatively unknown stars.One of the striking things about this film is how not-like-Hollywood it feels. There is nothing formulaic in the narrative nor are viewers pushed into an emotional corner. It is funny, sincere, definitely original, and far too long. By using humour intelligently rather than to exploit the quick gag for a loud laugh, it offers warm insight into the universal father-daughter bond that is as unorthodox as it is endearing."
" Does Anyone Know an Editor?

Were this a 70-minute movie, it might be quirky and eccentric, with some Important Message about Enjoying the Moment. However, it is not 70 minutes. It is 160 minutes, and so Herr Simonischek spends about two and a half hours tormenting his daughter -- and the audience -- until she has her own nervous breakdown and existential crisis.How was this movie nominated for Best Foreign Movie? Did watching it cause an existential crisis, or is it that half the dialogue is in English, which must impress the largely Anglophone Academy? Also there are some quirky moments scattered through the movie; about five, making up almost a minute of its length. The rest of the jokes are neither numerous nor worth offering.How do I know? Because these are the sort of jokes I would make. I would test them out on my cousin or one or two friends in a deadpan fashion. Take the joke the hero does about how his daughter is never there and even when she is, she is on the phone. Therefore, the joke goes, he has hired a young woman to play his daughter and clip his toe nails. My in-house testing -- so to speak -- would yield a result from a grunt (the worst rating, acknowledging it), to a question about how well she clips toe nails (the best rating). This would rate a grunt and so would be abandoned. Only the best rated jokes go into my repertoire. Not so in this movie.As I indicated, at 70 minutes, this might have made a light, almost Tati-esque movie. At two hours and forty minutes, though, it is so Teutonic in its exhaustive detail that all I can do is marvel at its stultifying length."
" The most overrated film of the year.
",0.0,0.9962,2017-02-17 00:00:00,7,"""Toni Erdmann"" is a father/daughter comedy-drama from Germany that critics are calling a masterpiece and the best film of the year when, in fact, it's just the kind of sentimental twaddle that Hollywood does somewhat more slickly and already we're told it's to be remade as a vehicle for Jack Nicholson in a role that could win him a fourth Oscar.It certainly isn't a bad movie but it's far from being a great one and at almost three hours is way too long. The humour is broad and obvious and every plot device is signposted in advance. What redeems the film are the performances of Peter Simonischek as the father and Sandra Huller as his daughter. Indeed, Simonischek is terrific as the shambolic joker who decides to interfere in his daughter's business affairs when he feels she isn't coping and Toni Erdmann is the fictitious character he invents to activate his plan. Huller is equally good as the daughter who seems to have lost her way in life, (her rendition of 'The Greatest Love of All' is worth the price of admission). In fact, they are both so good I just kept wishing they had better material to work with. It's pleasant enough but I am still baffled by its success."
" Eccentric dad helps corporate go-getter daughter to lighten up in this somewhat amusing but lightweight affair
",0.3514,0.992,2017-02-16 00:00:00,6,"Toni Erdmann is the product of German screenwriter, director, and co-producer Maren Ade. This is a film that has gotten a slew of accolades probably due to its offbeat characters and narrative. Yes it scores points for that but honestly it's quite lightweight and certainly not howlingly funny.The Erdmann plot can be summed up in a paragraph. Toni is actually Winfried Conradi (Peter Simonischek), an eccentric, retired music teacher who has a penchant for pulling pranks--he becomes concerned about his ultra-serious, go-getter daughter, Ines (Sandra Hüller), who works as a corporate consultant, stationed in Bucharest, Romania. Winfried adopts an alter ego as Toni Erdmann and follows his daughter around dressed in a wig and false teeth, bent on getting her to lighten up and to realize that there are more important things in life than getting ahead at work—such as not taking things oh so very seriously.Winfried begins his campaign to break down Ines' defenses when, at a US Embassy reception, he tells Henneberg--a German oil company CEO with whom Ines is attempting to secure a consulting contract—that he's hired a ""replacement daughter"" since his own daughter is too busy to have much to do with him. To Ines' surprise, Henneberg invites both her and Winfried for some drinks where he makes fun of her oddball father.Ines is annoyed by her father's interference in her life and blames him for not waking her up after oversleeping. Winfried then agrees to fly back to Germany. It turns out to be a ruse as the father regroups and shows up later in the persona of Toni Erdmann, pretending he's a life coach in front of Ines and her two friends whom she's met up with at a bar.Ines' anger with her father reaches its apotheosis when he handcuffs himself to her but forgets the key; eventually, however, after help removing the handcuffs, she eventually sees the value in pretending Toni Erdmann is a real person. After she agrees to have him accompany her to business meetings, ""Toni"" takes Ines to a Romanian family's Easter celebration where Ines finally loosens up and enjoys herself singing a Whitney Houston song, off-key.Ines throws caution to the wind when she hosts a business brunch at her apartment, strips naked and asks all those who show up to come inside to the party, naked too. Her father shows up in a Bulgarian kukeri costume, a sort of ""Gumby-like"" suit and they later end up in a park, embracing one another.Ines has come full circle at the denouement when she puts on her father's false teeth. It's also revealed that she's quit her job and has gotten a new one in Singapore. Obviously there's nothing really profound here. It's a rather simplistic admonition on Ms. Ade's part to ""lighten up."" Most people have an ""eccentric uncle"" in their life and in this case, it's an eccentric father. Recently it was announced that Jack Nicholson will be playing Toni Erdmann in an American re- make. Perhaps he'll be able to extract a few extra laughs here or there but my guess is that the narrative will remain a decidedly lightweight affair."
" Wonderful, random and really funny
",0.7841,0.9927,2017-02-16 00:00:00,9,"I saw this film yesterday and absolutely loved it. I have never seen anything quite like this before, with such a raw and honest feel and so many absolutely ransom situations that are moving and hilariously funny at the same time. Both lead actors have absolutely nailed it, and I did wonder sometimes if parts of this film might have been slightly improvised. They almost feel too natural to be scripted. Being German myself I'm so proud that this film is German made, a country that's supposed to be stiff and have no humour at all. A big compliment to the writers of this film, you have created something incredibly unique that I will surely watch again and recommend to my friends. It's so easy to get involved with those characters and really feel for them. Even though it's quite long and slow paced at times, it didn't feel like any scene was unnecessary or didn't add to the story. It's broken up wonderfully by Toni's random acts of ""making my daughter laugh"" and leaves you thinking about it for quite a while.I can whole heartedly recommend watching this film."
" One of the Year's Best
",0.6369,0.9523,2017-02-15 00:00:00,10,"Toni Erdmann is the alter ego of Winfried Conradi, an aging father with a penchant for practical jokes who decides he doesn't like the direction his daughter's (Ines) joyless life has taken and tries to get her to loosen up and live a little.We don't learn much about the relationship that has led up to the series of events that comprise the film, but based on their awkwardness when together and the fact that Winfried is divorced from Ines's mother, we sense that there is resentment on the part of Ines, and that perhaps Winfried has not always been as present for his daughter as she would have liked. She understandably, then, resents him meddling in her affairs and having him surprise her with a visit to Bucharest, where she is stationed while working on an important contract for her company. He pops up at work events disguised as Toni Erdmann and pulls her into an ongoing game that only he seems to find funny.Given that the movie is named for him, we assume that it is going to be about Winfried. But as the movie evolves, we realize that it is much more about Ines, who is played in a marvelous performance by Sandra Huller. Her resistance to her father's sense of humor begins to wane as she becomes increasingly displeased with her thankless career and the way she is treated as a woman by the men around her, until she decides to take a lesson from her father's manual and pull a prank at a birthday party that results in one of the film's most wonderfully bizarre scenes. This is followed quickly by one of its sweetest, as Ines thanks her father for reminding her that life is awfully long without a sense of humor.The final scene of the film is ambiguous, and it's been interesting to me to read different viewers' interpretations of it. Time has passed and Ines and Winfried are together at his mother's funeral. In a moment of spontaneity, she partakes in a bit of silliness, and Winfried rushes off to go get his camera. The movie ends before he comes back, with a lingering shot of Ines's face as the brief moment of silliness passes and is replaced with a look of unhappiness. I suppose this ending will mean different things to different people. Is this a sign of Winfried not listening to his own lectures about enjoying the moment and inadvertently ruining yet another in the long line of moments we suspect he has ruined with his daughter? Or is this Winfried realizing that moments of delight and happiness are fleeting and that they should be captured in order to be preserved? I don't know and I don't care. Life and the feelings of which it is composed are ambiguous and can mean many different things at the same time.""Toni Erdmann"" is on my list of the best movies I've seen this year.Grade: A+"

It took the movie 1 hour and a half to introduce Toni Erdmann, like seriously? Nothing interesting happened in the first half (nor the last half). I honestly don't understand how it's even compared to ""A Man Called Ove"", ""Land of Mine"" or ""The Salesman"", they are so much better by far!! I, personally, don't think this movie even deserved a nomination. Maybe it's Germany's humor, but it never made me smile. I found the main characters so annoying and poorly constructed. Screenplay was all over the place; and the list of bad things could go on and on and on. Please, don't waste nearly 3 hours of your life, go watch the other nominees instead. PS. I can't believe Hollywood is thinking of a remake. I really hope they make a few (A LOT) of adjustments to the story, maybe Kristen Wiig can save it."

What has produced me the most is shame. Family is a very special issue, we agree. The fact that you want your daughter or any other member of the family to have more life, enjoy life and not devote so much to work, is very well and indeed we have seen in countless films. But to do as this father does, it seems a bit unpleasant to say it well.Is not it easier, to take advantage of the few free moments to prepare different things? I think that anyone who lives in such situations would be very angry. Work or working life is such a very important part of people's lives that it can occupy much more than a third of your life.The amount of trouble I could have gotten her daughter, I thought was too much. And seeing all the companions laughing at the father, I felt sorry for her.The film has become long, long. I could have put more sequences of more moments of the negotiation, the truth I do not know if they needed? See how the woman tells the father, who knew he was not the ambassador, unfortunate.The actors are very good, too bad that the wrong way.The photograph seems very ugly, there were moments that I thought to put on sunglasses.The address, I have already commented, simple and without direction, simple planes, and does not know that it is long.The case is that the movie I believe it, I think I'm watching a story, but I find everything so disgusting, it does not help me.Spoiler:See how the woman tells the father, who knew he was not the ambassador, unfortunate.That if I must say that the part of the final party, naked, is well thought out. The character of the woman is doing very well, not admitting that she has not had time to prepare and the excuse is nudity, but it would be as simple as asking for a minute, putting on a robe and then getting dressed, she is at home ."

I cannot believe that the film industry in Germany is so miserable that such a catastrophe is chosen as their candidate for an academy award. This screenplay is ultra-weird, not for the unusual timeline of the movie, but exactly for two disgusting scenes. The sex part with pastry, and the birthday party; I regret to mention, but only perverts can think of such stories. Awful; waste of time and money...The main idea could be elevated into an interesting story not necessarily by a very professional screenplay writer, but even middle. This movie is a false and defective combination of Hollywood films' and French films' philosophy. That is, at intervals the tone switches between those two ideas."

An interesting satire of contemporary professional success at the cost of one's own (un)happiness. That is what it was meant to be. But the message gets diluted, there are very slow paces and redundancies that spoil the enjoyment. Some gratuitous tricks that do not lead anywhere. Moments so embarrassing that one would rather be alone when watching something like this. The father - daughter relationship that somehow barely survives through the meanderings of the film. With a good editing and a more ballsy director, it would probably have been a good movie. As such, on the current trend, it might spoil the chances of much better films of getting this year's Academy Award."
" dear ol' dad
",0.3818,0.9922,2017-02-08 00:00:00,8,"Greetings again from the darkness. A list of the best German movies of all time would likely feature very few comedies. It's not a country or culture that tends to laugh much at its history (for good reason) or itself. A case could be made that this latest little gem from writer/director Maren Ade belongs on such a list, and although it features several laugh out loud moments, whether it should be labeled a comedy is certainly worthy of debate.Winfried (Peter Simonischeck) has been a mostly absentee dad, but now he is deservedly concerned about his daughter's well being. He is intent on trying to get Ines (Sandra Huller) to let go of her uptight, high stress corporate persona and enjoy life a bit. It's the kind of advice only those who have really lived can rightfully offer up  though you've likely never seen advice administered in such a creative and cringe-inducing manner.Winfried's alter-ego is Toni Erdman, a shaggy wig and false teeth wearing goofball who manages to insert himself into the most inconvenient and awkward moments for Ines and her business. His pranks are designed to illustrate just how ridiculous the workaholic treadmill is and how little joy accompanies such a work-a-day life.Having been nominated for a Best Foreign Language Oscar, it's easy to crown this as the frontrunner in the category. Ines' birthday party shines a new light on the phrase ""birthday suit"", and that sequence alone might have generated more laughter than I heard in a theatre all year. Yet despite the laughs and Toni's shenanigans (and there are many), at its core, this is a film about loneliness and the emptiness of life without happiness. Perhaps you could call it a philosophical comedy, but it's downright chilling to see the raw emotion of Ines as she belts out Whitney Houston's ""Greatest Love of All"", or finally strips herself (literally) of all pretense.NOTE: it was recently announced that Jack Nicholson will come out of retirement and join Kristen Wiig in an American remake. As exciting as that seems, don't let it stop you from seeing this original."

The main question is, of course, can it deliver? Can it confound the cynics and show the world that the Master Race is not such a disaster race in terms of belly laughs. The answer is a definite maybe with the audience still out.

" Wigging Funny
",0.4404,0.9989,2017-02-05 00:00:00,10,"This review for Toni Erdmann is spoiler free ***** (5/5) PICTURE A SITUATION: when you start work, and you're in a very important meeting that could potentially change your company, then you think nothing can ruin your chances at that, until seemingly the worst possible thing happens and your father walks into your building and he starts telling you all these things, while trying to show his love then you walk away embarrassed at the situation while your colleagues are laughing at the embarrassment. This is the situation Maren Ade's Cannes Film Festival darling placing in her award winning film Toni Erdmann a film about a father-daughter relationship that's on the tip of the iceberg.You may think that is the most enjoyable thing, yet, there is a catch she's a workaholic and he's a practical joker who loves changing his persona by placing Jurgen Klopp-esque fake dentures and then putting on a shaggy wig, just to make his daughter laugh like she used to. Ade places many odds in the film, and every time she tries her hardest to stack the odds against the film. The result; it's nearly three hours long, it's set against a densely detailed world of German business consultants. It's also a comedy built around wigs, whoopee cushions and ejaculating on mini cakes.Yet it's funny, perceptive, alive to life's richness and absurdities and in its final moments it's absolutely devastating. Toni Erdmann's set up sounds like a well-tooled Hollywood comedy: prankster father cheers up his workaholic daughter through wacky sometimes funny personas – here saccharine life lessons ensue throughout. Happily, Ade has no truck with the final formula. Thanks to fantastic writing and superlative performances, the relationship between soft-hearted, hang-dog Winifried (Peter Simonischek) and his daughter, built-for-work Ines (Sandra Hüller), feels authentic – deftly toggling between affection and stone-cold exasperation. However there is no ill intent or malice on either side but the pair can't help but disappoint each other over and over again. And it's an absolute delight to watch from start to finish.However, at two hours and forty two minutes long it is a slightly episodic side to the immense character study, but this amount of time is needed because within every minute there is a lot to love about the lovable soul Winifried, and even though he tries his hardest to impress his daughter, she always feels embarrassed by his mis-placed – sometimes timely practical jokes. Ade delivers each cheeky laugh, each moment of sincere hilarity in spades it's relentlessly funny, there is something here of the deadpan absurdity of A Swedish Love Story's director Roy Andersson in her worldview – ad continuously creates a malleable tone that can take in a man dressed as a tree or even a wookie-like beast and always feels real.Also she never forgets to mine the human from the high concept. It's delivered in beautifully observed moments such as when Ines and Winifried say goodbye to each other and have to awkwardly endure a wait for the elevator. From the film's opening moments – Winifried plays an elaborate joke on a courier – to a naked party set-piece to its climactic moment of heart-rending surrealism, Toni Erdmann hits so many high notes in the emotional strain. The effect is dazzling. Every moment of this beautifully mastered comedy is hilariously drawn, gorgeously played and immaculately told, there is no end to the relentless comedy that Ade pulls in her gorgeous film. It's a brilliant oddity.VERDICT: An absurdly original and hilarious German comedy with stellar performances by Simonischek and Hüller, Toni Erdmann is not just the funniest film of 2017; it's the funniest film in recent memory."

",0.2263,0.999,2017-02-04 00:00:00,7,"I had tough time to figure it out what was the thing on the poster. Seeing it upside down, with mirror, name it, I used all the tricks I know, but nothing had worked. On the other hand, I thought it might be a fantasy film with a King Kong like creature. That's the curiosity it created, people to a have different opinions and forget to expect from the film. But it was a simple comedy-drama and only way to solve the mystery is to watch the film. That's what I finally did.The opening scene was good. But I did not think the whole film would be like that. It was about a prankster and his attempts to reach his workaholic daughter, which was the entire narration. A lifetime trip for them, that's not about the challenges in the world or the nature, but their self-discovery, the meaning of life and purpose. This is one of the beautiful films to open up about a father and daughter relationship. In the grown-up world, the people forget to live the actual life, when they give all the focus to their professional life.I have to agree, this is a competitive world and you will be replaced by millions of other waiting behind you for such opportunity. But does it all worth doing is the real question. Doubts like that won't arise without those who love us pointing it out. It needs to be asked properly, politely. But some people take an alternate route like in this film. Sometimes it ends in an unexpected adventure to just realise what they are into. And this film was honest, to reveal as much as it can in many angles.This is the story of Winfried. An aged and divorced music teacher who makes practical jokes to people around him. After his dog died, he decides to reconnect with his only daughter Ines, who is now working in Romania. She is on the cusp to get her desired position in the office. On her one final push for that, is now getting distracted by her father. She who never understood her father's way of life, tries to get an answer out of him about the life. So that's where their journey begins. Some of the bold steps taken by them, the film accomplishes what it wanted to tell us in a unique way.""The problem is it's so often about getting things done. You do this, You do that. And in the meantime, life just passes by.""The film was actually loosely based by the director's own father. The writing was brilliant. It reminded me 'Infinitely Polar Bear', because these women directors inspired by their fathers to show the world how their childhood was like. The actors were amazing, particularly those two in the main roles. I liked them both equally. From the different angle, they have given different performances. There's no surprise if you liked the film only because of them.The film had won many prestigious awards around the globe and now its biggest stand off is at the 2017 Oscars which is a few weeks away. Another Scandinavian film, which is also nominated for the Oscar, is also about an old man like this one. But I think 'Under Sandet' is the frontrunner for the golden statue. Because we all know that America's and Academy's sentimental towards the WWII.When it comes to rating, the film is strictly for adults. It was good in the initial parts, but there are some surprise nude and sex scenes. At that time I thought it lost its path, but actually that was the turning point where you are going to witness a different half of the film. Surely many people going love the second half more than the first.At first, it looked like it is a German version of 'The Family Fang', but only more realistic with dark humour. It's difficult to understand every scene, especially in the first watch. Because without knowing the film characters, the events involving them look casual. Capable to get the sense of humour is the key here. So if you decide for the second time viewing, you will learn more about it. It is one of those films that second time watch necessary for some people.Frankly, I did not think it was a great film, just after finish my watch. But thinking back about all those film events, made sense. By the time I decided to write this review, I was in its favour. That's the reason I won't write about the films right away. This is a great film, but you have to focus closely and understand everything, then you will have a great time. But remember, it is one of the longest film in the recent time, particularly for a comedy-drama, yet enjoyable. Recommended!7/10"

I confess my list would consist of Toni Erdmann and Deutschland '83 (well, it has funny bits, doesn't it?)And as you leave the film theatre 162 minutes after the opening of a spectacularly soundtrack-free Toni Erdmann you're left reflecting on the fact that it was funny, and when I say funny I mean screaming out loud as part of a cacophonous melee of film goers, but was it REALLY a comedy?You see, it's also deeply moving and actually the underlying sadness of the whole thing, the painful loneliness of the two extraordinary leads (both of whom should be Oscar nominated), makes your unrestrained laughter feel like a betrayal of their fragile mental health.Father and daughter, Winfreid (alias Toni Erdmann) and Ines, are a dysfunctional 69 year old and 40 something.He's a semi retired music teacher with a practical joker streak. She's a hard as nails management consultant who's idea of a good time is to take a client's wife mall-shopping, anything to succeed in her high stress work environment where she's willing to trample over people to the top.She has eliminated emotion from her life and that's hurting no-one more than her dad Winfred (Peter Simonischek).On a flying trip home from her temporary workplace in Bucharest, Romania she stages fake phone calls so as to distance herself from her family and friends group who are hosting an early birthday party for her. Her father can't bear it and so springs a surprise trip to Bucharest, only days later, to see if he can win back her stone cold affection.Sandra Huller, who played Ines, is magnificent in her role. She engages in filthy hotel room sex with her underling but completely without love or desire. She attends conventions on weekends, she socialises with a girl group but it's a veneer of enjoyment as she sips unenthusiastically from half full drinks glasses – letting drink overwhelm her would be a DISASTER -and she has seemingly lost the ability to even FAKE smile.She is a world class cold fish.Arriving in Bucharest, her dad tracks her down and starts following her having assumed a persona, Toni Erdmann, Life Coach, in a long brown wig and oversized false teeth and somehow inveigles his way into her work group. That's where the humour really kicks in, as he pursues a series on 'did he really do that' set pieces that contain a variety of comedy tropes including mime, slapstick and pathos.It's devastatingly funny in places. Most notably when he attends Ines' actual birthday party which has already assumed levels of absurdity never before seen on screen.This is an absurdist comedy at the end of the day. In places completely surreal. That's why it's certainly not for everyone. The reviews on IMDb range from awestruck to awful so I hesitate to say you'll love it, but me and my wife both did.It's glacially slow but stick with it.It rewards patience and stamina, but is engrossing from first frame to last.This truly is a comedy classic.You may need hankies."
" blink and you'll miss it - great cinema
",0.5423,0.9909,2017-02-01 00:00:00,9,"'Toni Erdmann' is a wild farce of a movie that twists and turns for nearly 3 hours down roads you wouldn't expect. It's a straight-up comedy except for the fact that it's also a very moving and sad portrait of a relationship between father and daughter. In retrospect I can't think of many moments that seem funny on paper. I think it's just the fact that a wig and fake teeth just trigger an instinctual chuckle.This is a German production by Maren Ade (the director and writer) who drew inspiration from her own relationship with her father in this story. With such an original voice it's clear to see real-life ties. We all must know that relative or friend who will stop at nothing to put a smile on the face of others - a sort of selfless act that reveals more about a person that you might believe. That is Winfried (Peter Simonischek) who lives alone with his dying dog, detached from his ex-wife and estranged from his daughter Ines (Sandra Hüller) who spends her time working in big oil in Bucharest. We meet Winifried at the beginning of the film trying to fool a delivery man by donning fake teeth and pretending to be making a pipe bomb. Later, we see him visit his elderly mother with face paint like a skeleton. He's a clown that works to only get a laugh. Outwardly, you wouldn't think his life was that spectacular.After seeing his daughter during her Birthday, Winifried begins to see that Ines is not as happy or successful as she is leading on. She takes long phone calls and thinly masks a sense of terror that nobody can recognize besides her father. On a whim, he decides to travel to Bucharest to spend some time with her. She puts him on the pull-out couch and is generally dismissive of his presence, instead working to impress her CEO and try her hardest to impress the corporate heads who might finally give her the promotion she wants.The relationship between these two characters is endlessly interesting and carefully strategized. At a cocktail party, Winifried brings his fake teeth (always tucked in his breast pocket - just in case) and Ines rolls her eyes. When she fails to charm the CEO, she is mortified to see her own father becoming chummy with him over small talk and vulgarities. She is weakened by the fact that even though she is more successful, her father will always have the upper hand. She never says this, but it's clear through her actions.After a few days, Winifried leaves to head home and leave his daughter be, and yet no sooner is she back at work than a mysterious figure appears: a tall man with an obviously fake wig and dentures named Toni Erdmann. The rouse is so clearly fake and yet Ines makes the choice to accept her father as this clown - a life coach with a knack for wearing the same velvet suit over and over. To her coworkers and friends who don't know Winifried, they see Mr. Erdmann as a real man who is larger than life. Ines, reluctant at first, ever so slowly comes to see her father in a new light.I don't think that's really an accurate description of the plot if only because the movie feels much more spontaneous. The staging of scenes and the way dialogue progresses helps greatly in setting the tone for this indescribable movie. There is a scene in which Ines and her supervisor are on a rooftop garden discussing plans for a business venture, and in the out-of-focus background we suddenly see a man taking a phone call and fiddling with a whoopie cushion. If you don't pay attention you won't see it. Another wild moment sees Ines throwing a small Birthday party at her house and finally letting it all go... Quite literally.The run time in itself is the main talking point for this movie: a 3-hour German comedy. Who knew? What I came to see after is that this time is so focused on developing the relationship of these two people that any shorter running time might have had a lessened impact. By the time the final scene rolls around and Ines jokingly puts her father's teeth in, it's a reward of patience and a complete fulfillment of the arc of such a crazy story. In retrospect that last scene in particular has so much more weight when we see the roles change and Ines slowly step into the role of sympathizer to care for her father. It's easy to miss, but in a movie where a man uses a cheese grater as a source of euphoria, such a quiet conclusion really speaks wonders."
" Excellent
",0.5719,0.9841,2017-01-30 00:00:00,10,"I loved the movie but at first wasn't sure why. The clue is probably that the movie is quite refreshing. The authors stayed away from the common clichés and comedy tricks.I also loved it because working in the same professional area as Ines I was able to appreciate the deep satire of the corporate newspeak and consulting culture presented in this movie. The overzealous assistant, the culture of feedback and team building (getting naked as a team building activity is a genius idea!), body language and the politics behind client meetings - all that is satirized in this movie in a hilarious manner. The acting was great too. The best film I've seen for a while."
" hilarious and compelling story of relationship between daughter and father
",0.5574,0.9958,2017-01-27 00:00:00,8,"It is a hilarious and compelling story of relationship between aging father and his compassionate daughter. Protagonist daughter, Ines Conradi, is business consultant. Role of father, Winfried Conradi, is played by Peter Simonischek. I really loved character of Ines played by Sandra Huller. She is full of expressions, humane and played excellent acting. Her work pressure, anxiety of failed conversation, corporate submission towards male colleagues, and patience and kindness towards her father look honest and real. She is on business trip of Romania to make outsourcing deals with CEO for natural oil station installations. All of a sudden her aging father, Winfried Conradi, stalks behind her from office lobby to reconnect with her. Ines knew about it but she accepts him as he is. He produces many dilemmas with his bizarre behavior and conversations, but his daughter is patient, compassionate to let him be as he is. She accepts his father despite his presence has ruined her workplace surrounding. She is kind enough to fulfill wish of her father to know what she does. Her attachment towards him keeps growing. Let me tell why this movie is so humorous. Father tired to amuse people around his daughter with fake identity as Toni Erdmann, a life coach of CEO. He uses wig to hide white hairs, he wears blazer and business casual to look professional. He uses false teeth for fun. She does not hesitate to take her dad for office party, dinner, shopping. He pretends himself as German ambassador during their visit to Oil installation units. He made her daughter sing a song 'Greatest Love of All' impromptu on his piano. Cinematography of movie is unique way to making characters alive fluidly. Character is a prime focus of camera. Locations and dialogues tell a Romanian culture and corporate environment. A European woman is playing multiple soles simultaneously and able to do work life balance."
" Very funny movie!
",0.54,0.97,2017-01-24 00:00:00,8,"Very funny with a dry straight man wit. Ballsy angle in my opinion. It could have made the humorous moments go over your head, but it didn't, so it paid off. At two hours and forty two mins, the movie ran the chance of being too long. It's a comedy, it's strange to be that long. Similar in that sense to This is 40 in which it's long because as much as it is funny, some real emotional issues are happening in the film.You do not want to downplay the daddy daughter relationship happening in Toni Erdmann that is the center of the movie, but you do want people to laugh while relating. Unlike This is 40, Toni Erdmann does find this perfect balance that is the Dramaedy.From the moment the movie starts the jokes starts and never ends. It grabs you and never lets go.A great film."
" A brilliantly serio-comic exposition on the alienation and re-connection in today's world
",0.4404,0.9927,2017-01-22 00:00:00,8,"The top seed of 2017 Oscar's BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE PICTURE race is from Germany, TONI ERDMANN, director Maren Ade's third feature, debuted in Cannes last year, was given a cold shoulder from the jury, but has been riding a terrific winning streak ever since, it is an unconventional art-house pleaser on top of its very art-house premise - where its poster cagily teases something very eccentric and surreal is in the offering, aka. that black furry thing, which successfully tickles one's curiosity. But why ""unconventional""? Because the film unyieldingly flouts our anticipation of wackiness and refuses to take its subject out of its mundane context, only to achieve a therapeutically sloughing catharsis. The opening shots take a close stance with overlong pauses (Ade and her DP's modus operandi in keeping a wary eye on its character, seldom becomes noticeably intrusive by nimbly slithering among the surroundings), where we are introduced to a salt-and-pepper German man Winfried Conradi (Simonischek), whose avuncular casualness is undermined by his deadpan trick of impersonation he plays on the overtly uncomfortable delivery man, is that supposed to be funny or creepy? Then the film doles out more background information about Winfried, a high school music teacher, divorced, has a senescent mother and leads a rather lonely life with his aging dog, his offbeat temperament and sloven mien is more alienating than amiable among his acquaintances. Instigated by the death of his dog, Winfried takes a spontaneous trip to Bucharest, where his daughter Ines (Hüller) works as a corporate strategist, who is always busy and far away. Of course, Winfried's visit wrong-foots Ines, it is not a convenient time (and there will never be one), she is under serious strain apropos of an imminent business presentation which really matters to her career, and seems subconsciously discomfited of Winfried's gawky presence, a sneaking wisp of mortification stems right from her distant demeanour. Finding himself quite an inconvenience, Winfried decides to cut his visit short. A big relief for Ines, it seems, but little does she know that her smouldering exasperation, pent-up frustration and engulfing vacuity (both in her profession and personal life) will spur Winfried to bring about his alter ego, the titular Toni Erdmann by virtue of a straggly wig and a pair of denture, into Ines's stifled careerist life-pattern, he haunts around her like a phantasm, invents different identities (a life coach, the German ambassador) to get himself involved. After the initial shock, Ines acquiesces to play along, introduces him to her friends and her decadent lifestyle, even brings him with her on a business sortie, conversely, through Toni, her icy shield would slowly break apart by humanly interactions, and the crux is an impromptu nude party where she finally sheds off all the hypocrisy and baggage life imposed on her and sees clearly for the first time who are real friends and who are just passing phonies, also a consummating hug to her father who is trapped in a giant mascot costume leavens both enthralling quirkiness and tear-eyed earnestness. What TONI ERDMANN presses home is a rare bracing otherness and confidence totally unencumbered by the painful self-consciousness one cannot run away in our lives, then, Ms. Ade spikes it with organic humor to sustain its watchability and also with reflexive contemplation to hoist viewers to vicariously face the same quandary, Ines and Winfried's daughter-father relation crashingly reflects modern society's pandemic pathology: businesslike politeness, apathy, superficiality and emotional-clogging - which has undergone a judicious and unsentimental vivisection through the high-wire dexterity of Ade and her crew. Sandra Hüller's crowning moment is her emotive live rendition of THE GREATEST OF ALL, swipes as an emotional crunch after the film's painstaking process of paving ballast. Most of the time, she never relents in manifesting her real emotions, but when she does, whether it is obnoxious (the twisted semen-swallowing power showboating), idiosyncratic (the whimsical idea of a nude party), or heartfelt (the scene where she watches her father leave in a taxi from her terrace), she holds court with utter conviction and empathy, what an extraordinary feat not the least because on paper, Ines is such a repugnant character benumbed by her unwholesome surroundings and stuck in her own toughened and barely tangible superiority. Peter Simonischek, strikingly counterpoises as an outré figure but infuses Winfried with a self-deprecating geniality and unspoken tenderness, who splashes out sage life philosophy to his workaholic daughter, a father figure rings true to many a spectator. A brilliantly serio-comic exposition on the alienation and re-connection in today's world, TONI ERDMANN is Ade's magnum opus which intrepidly bucks the trend of bombastic artifice, and returns to a slow-burning set-up nevertheless full of scintillating whims and unexpected epiphanies."
" Life alone vs life in a group
",-0.25,0.9639,2017-01-22 00:00:00,9,"It's great to see such a positively crazy character as Winfried. He has his own world, colorful, where he tries to constantly exchange mundanity for jokes. He doesn't find much support or friendship in people, they find him childish and crazy though they don't condemn him, the closest people accepts him the way he is. He likes to be among children, which are still full of life, smile and jokes. Capacity or need for closeness and care he expressed to his dog. After he is gone, he come up with an idea to, in his opinion, show his daughter that her lifestyle is very inhumane and she must realize that time is slipping off her hands. It turns out that Ines is not at all blindly lost in the modern corporate culture, she seems rather purposely choosing the lifestyle she has. She is not even surprised with the moments when her child part comes into play, for example when the girl in her cries for emotions she is not able to express, when she is waving her father from the balcony. I felt with the film passing by, that all I see isn't for sure black and white. Father realized at some point of the time before, that he has lost many years not appreciating the moments that were there, now he really wants to warn his daughter. We will always miss on life, no matter how we are aware that we should not. Instead of feeling the moment we observe them, that's when father missed amazing moment with her daughter again. She took his fake teeth and a cap, there was something going on in her heart, a wave of honesty, of playfulness came to her, she might have just wanted to try to express her feelings to the father, by acting some scene or by pretending she is him. The energy, the moment was gone when Winfried decide to go for a camera to take a picture of funny- looking Ines. It is interesting to watch two-similar-though-different personalities. The father and the daughter have a lot in common actually. They seem to be both not really born to live in the group, they are more on the side of the family life. In the movie we can see two different 'full families' gathering. For people who are there it seems very natural and pleasant to be spending time cultivating family life. It doesn't though for two main characters. Is it their personality or their fears?"

I met ""these"" people over the last 25 years in Bucharest and in Germany.In this ""new global world"", the most of the time everybody is so deep into the details of ""knowing how to be"" because everybody is already like this, that if you take a step back and watch from a different angle you might wonder if anyone still remembers what it is to be a human. To remember the pleasure of feeling secure and loved by the ones that are guaranteed to be the ones that will do so. And finally if you get the right angle, you have to admit that everyone around you looks ridiculously, trying to find the detail in the detail that would make a difference, even if everybody does everything identically and there is obviously nothing else. The game about being a tough global business-woman/man, up to the most disgusting proofs to be the tougher one, is finally just flat and meaningless.The whole story is wonderful true. The actors are doing a fantastic job making you feel the frustration and discomfort that should be seen and felt by everyone living in such a world. It is not a slow movie ... it is the shortest version of an never-ending slow life with nothing that would make your heart pound for the true meanings.This movie brought two points to my mind.

" The most over-rated film of the decade
",0.0,0.9908,2017-01-16 00:00:00,3,"The opening scene gives you fair warning. The camera lingers on the front door of a house. And lingers. A mailman arrives with a package. He rings. And rings. The door opens and Mr. Conradi appears (actor Peter Simonischek). He makes jokes about the package being for his brother, who defuses bombs. He calls into the house for his brother, then goes inside. We wait with the postman. And wait. The brother shows up, but it's Conradi in a wig and fake teeth. Eventually the scene ends. But the movie will continue like this for almost three(!) hours. Conradi is in almost every scene, and he is a grotesque, ill-favored old man who treats people as if they were pawns in some grand comedy he's living. His main target is his daughter, a hard-working executive stationed in Bucharest (most of the film was shot in Romania). He treats no one with respect, especially not her, and he has no dignity.Almost every scene would benefit from being shortened, some by up to half. Whole scenes (e.g., the handcuffing, the sperm-splattered pastries) could have been cut without losing any of the point-- which by the way, is anything but fresh territory. Zorba the Greek leapt to mind as a similarly themed movie. In two words: enjoy life. Zorba, however, is a charming character. Mr. Conradi/Toni Erdmann is not.The multiple-award-winning actress Sandra Huller holds the film together, and the scene, toward the end, when she belts out Whitney Houston's ""Greatest Love of All,"" is a triumph of performance over production. That's pretty much it (and I'm not forgetting her prolonged nude scene). Without her presence, I would have walked out. This is a grossly over-rated film, and a painfully over-long one."

The films highest achievement is using this sort of comedy (""embarrassing comedy"") to purvey something about family, happiness and what's important in life. It might sound like banal themes, but they're explored in a heartwarming and funny way.My main objection with this movie is that I had a hard time understanding some of the characters at time, especially the daughter. Some of the choices she makes are probably meant to be irrational, but I don't think the movie managed to establish why she does it.Pitching this movie to others is also hard, as ""a 3 hour long German comedy"" does not sound that tempting.

It's a shamefully manipulative device that brings no visionary edge or joy of whimsy to reward us for our trouble. True believers of the aesthetic collective this movie serves may accuse us naysayers of having sanctimonious eyes, but it's simply a viewer's humble craving to engage a narrative without being toyed with like those dainty pastel pastries. The stellar reviews of this movie by the ""cognoscenti"" are mystifying, and some professional reviewers are intimidated to contest this group-think. I actually watched one reviewer in a panel understandably assert a spirited negative review only to immediately second-guess himself.

You can try to analyse, what the filmmakers intentions were or what may symbolise something, if you like doing that. The most obvious message of the movie (spend more time with your family) appears quite trivial. Some parts are somewhat funny because of the extreme absurdness of the events (don't expect subtlety). The laughter, however, mostly sticks in your throat. The characters are hard to understand, let alone identify with. There are a lot of silent moments, in which you get the chance to feel into the characters, only you don't feel much more than awkwardness.

" A close look at child-adult relationships
",0.0,0.9617,2017-01-01 00:00:00,9,"I'm an admirer of Ade's two previous films, so when I read the raves at Cannes I was excited, and then nervous, especially since it took months for the film to cross the Atlantic so I could actually see it. I was nervous the hype would be too much, but Toni Erdmann managed to deliver. The film follows Winifred Conrad, an elderly German man who loves harmless dumb jokes and works as a piano teacher. Divorced, with an ailing mother, and a daughter who lives abroad for work, his closest companion is his dog. And when his dog dies it sends him in a tailspin, reaching out to his daughter, Ines, who is located in Romania. Ines, working her way up the career ladder, as a consultant to an oil company, is all nerves and unhappiness. Despite the fact that they are father and daughter there is clearly a distance between them, caused by the gaps in their ages, their time apart, and their increasingly divergent values. It would be too much to go into the overall plot of the movie (Toni Erdmann the character doesn't truly waltz on screen until about an hour in though we get a taste of him very, very early in the film). And reading this it might not sound cinematic but that's Ade's gift. She is not a showy director, it would be hard to freeze frame a particular shot and come away with some beautiful tableaux (though there are some low-key moments of visual beauty in the film). Instead her genius is in the writing and the acting. She has written a beautiful script and allowed her characters to dig deep, to fully explore the tragedy that happens when adult children and parents find themselves as polite, but distant strangers where once they shared a home, a life, a love. This is very much a two-hander of a film between father and daughter, but as far as the acting goes Sandra Hüller's performance is sheer genius. Her character is not particularly ""likeable"" but in Hüller you see the pain and the sadness in her eyes and in her actions, her deep insecurities and annoyances. She is always very subtle, but my God, she can hold a frame, and watching her you know exactly what she is thinking even when she isn't saying a word. I'm surprised that so many reviews seem to be painting this as a comedy. There are a lot of laughs to be found in the movie, but make no mistake, there is also a lot of seriousness and drama."
