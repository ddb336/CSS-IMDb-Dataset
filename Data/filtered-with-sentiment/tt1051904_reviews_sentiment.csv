" Good
",0.4404,-0.3487,2021-01-10 00:00:00,8,This movie is good but not great and it is funny no cap.
" Very Forgettable
",0.0,0.9612,2020-11-25 00:00:00,4,"Average kiddie film, but from an adult/Goosebumps fan point of view it was lazy, rushed and not very gripping. Not enough depth to the characters or the story.
It does have a few nice moments, but they're not enough to justify the film as a whole. The CGI was decent, gave me Robin Williams' Jumanji vibes.However, the script was very weak and certainly doesn't pay much homage to R.L. Stine's books; even the cheesy 90s TV series did it far better than this. It's almost as if it forgets that Goosebumps is supposed be all about...well, giving you Goosebumps! Focused too much on the comedy and not enough on the chills.It's an OK watch for a young audience, but it's a very forgettable film, and disappointing if you're a fan of the books."
" Mildly entertaining.
",0.4404,0.1506,2020-11-05 00:00:00,6,Didn't like the characters. The plot was interesting enough. Wouldn't watch again though.

" Best Halloween Movie!
",0.6696,0.9892,2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,"Goosebumps is perfect from beginning to end with its clever jokes, great storytelling, fantastic CGI, and a cute romance. This movie brings Halloween to life with the Goosebumps tales. All the actors/actresses in this are amazing. Nothing falls flat and everything feels thrilling. The story flows naturally and brings new and interesting ideas to the table.
This is the best Halloween movie!"

" It was great.
",0.6249,0.9874,2020-10-01 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed it very much. Almost all of our favorite monster we come to know & love are in one movie! And with a giant twist. Love jack black as rl stine, slappy & the invisible boy.
But the ending needed more. After they put the monsters into a book and saved the world, I wanted to more of champ & taylor being with and giving emotional support to Zack after he lost Hannah. After hannah comes back, all four of them celebrated after being reunited.But still, rest of the movie was great."
" I'm impressed!
",0.5255,0.9934,2020-09-19 00:00:00,6,"Since I'm not a big comedy fan, 'Goosebumps' was never high up on my list of movies to see. Also because I'm not a Jack Black fan, and the trailer made the film look like a slapstick comedy. However, I am a big fan of fantasy films, so decided to give 'Goosebumps' the benefit of the doubt.I must confess to being pleasantly surprised. This was not slapstick as the trailer made me belief. On the contrary, there were actually some really funny moments. There were awesome action sequences, great cinematography and wonderful visuals, all of which overshadowed the few slapstick moments it dished up.I must also admit to actually liking Jack Black here. The role of RL Stine suited him perfectly. Dylan Minnette was really good as Zach, the film's protagonist. Thanks to his performance, the film has more seriousness than it probably ought to have. He grounded the film in a way, and was a very likable hero.With regards to the Hannah character (wonderfully portrayed by Odeya Rush), she lent a much deeper back story to an otherwise fantastical story. Her character had twists I never anticipated. The romance in the film is also quite sweet, and didn't feel forced or annoying - which so often happens to be the case with Hollywood films.From the film's very beginning, it is mysterious and mystical, and quickly spins out of control. I thoroughly enjoyed the myriad of monster characters (the werewolf was my favorite!) This was a rollercoaster ride of fun and excitement. Much better than expected!"
" Enjoyable Surprise.
",0.6124,0.7946,2020-07-14 00:00:00,8,"Selected this for the grandkids (they's seen it before), and didn't take much interest in it for the first 10 minutes doing other things, but finally started watching and listening, and then finally enjoying the rest of the movie. Pretty much non stop action, with quite a few funny lines (I seldom laugh, but I did during this). Maybe a few scary scenes for some younger children?Overall, quite an enjoyable movie. I've never read a Goosebumps book before - maybe I will now?"
" If you liked the books, you'll approve of this.
",0.4215,0.8115,2020-07-05 00:00:00,9,"This movie pays great homage to one of the most well known spooky mystery book series of the 90s. The graphics are well done (especially Slappy who actually looks like an evil ventriloquist dummy and not whatever that thing was on the Saturday morning TV show). Furthermore, they wove it all into a Jumanji-esque plot that worked well. This movie also proved what a versatile actor Jack Black is as he makes a very believable portrayal of a reclusive loner/mystery writer that shuts the public out so they don't discover/mishandle his dark secret."
" Great fun
",0.8126,0.9612,2020-06-27 00:00:00,7,"This film did a great job of combining all of the Goosebumps stories into one considering that there are so many of them. The characters were all interesting and well acted. Jack Black is expressive and determined as usual. I liked the overall plot, the twists and the monsters. Great adventure."
" Entertainment
",0.4215,0.5393,2020-06-16 00:00:00,7,This film may be cheesy and the story may not be perfect but overall it's still very enjoyable. As I used to read the Goosebumps books this movie is a fun adaptation even if it isn't the best!
" Goosebumps
",0.0,0.9743,2020-06-10 00:00:00,7,"Goosebumps The best part about meeting your favorite author is finally getting to tell them how to improve their books. Unfortunately, the teen in this family-comedy is only interested in the writer's daughter. When Zach (Dylan Minnette) and his mom (Amy Ryan) move in next-door to Mr. Shivers (Jack Black) and his daughter Hanna (Odeya Rush), Zach is instantly smitten with her. But when Zach and his friend (Ryan Lee) break into Hanna's house to free her from her father, they not only discover that Shivers is actually kid lit author R.L. Stine, but accidentally bring every monster he created for his horror series to life. A wholly original tale featuring elements from every Goosebumps book and TV episode, this awesome adaptation benefits greatly from Black's maniacal performance, as well as its spunky script and first-rate effects. However, if everything they wrote materialized authors would just write about licensed theme parks. Green Light"
" Average...should have been an anthology TV series rather than this concept
",0.0,0.7783,2020-05-23 00:00:00,4,"Just ok. Great special effects. Should have adapted R.L.Stein's books into an anthology TV series. They have decided on another concept for this film. It fails as a concept. Doesn't have enough suspense, humour or that emotional connection with the characters. A shame."
" Really got me goosebumps
",0.0,0.96,2020-05-18 00:00:00,10,The movie is awesome! The demons and ghosts all are giving me goosebumps and really scare me a lot. But definitely recommended to watch! Yay for happy ending!
" Moves at a steady pace with enuff monsters n fun to keep u entertained.
",0.7184,0.8801,2020-04-20 00:00:00,8,"I revisited this with my daughter n nephew last evening.
The best part about this film is that it moves at a very steady pace n doesn't get boring or preachy at all.A teenage boy unintentionally unleashes the monsters from Stine's books.
It has all the monsters but the focus is more on the Werewolf n Snowman n both of em r pretty well done.
Since it's based on the children's book n one of the best part about the books is that they never contain any depravity, drugs or violence.
So dont expect monster mayhem in this film."
" You'd be a dummy to miss it. You know, if you have an affinity with the genre and stuff...
",-0.1531,0.5222,2020-04-15 00:00:00,7,"This was a fun blockbuster adventure, nowhere near to horror but that was probably for the best.I am not intimately familiar with the books but it was enjoyable to see this homage with Jack Black stealing the show as the neurotic recluse.The supernatural elements aren't very well thought through and if you didn't know what you were watching then it would be quite a shock and the interpersonal elements of the narrative are actually better handled than they have a right to be without too much time devoted to the new characters we don't care so much about.Stunning in terms of visual appeal with the practical effects dummy adding an admirable touch. He is truly a charismatic and formidable villain."
" Give yourself Goosebumps
",0.0,0.9319,2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"Going in to this movie, I didn't really know what to expect. All I knew was that it had all the monsters and villains from the ""Goosebumps"" books, and frankly, I was worried that too many characters would give it a case of ""Spider-Man 3"" syndrome. Luckily, I was wrong. The plot is easy to follow, and most of the monsters are just background characters. Slappy is the main villain and the rest are just his minions. Jack Black did a great job as R. L. Stine and Slappy, and you can tell he's having a lot of fun with the roles. There was a character named Champ (Ryan Lee) and he should have been written out of the script. He's supposed to be the comic relief sidekick, but every line he says is just cringeworthy and painfully unfunny. He's just annoying! The movie would have been improved by a lot without him. Everyone else, however, was good. Not great, but good. The plot isn't that original. It's basically ""Jumanji"" with ""Goosebumps"" characters, but it's still a lot of fun. If you grew up reading the books or watching the t.v. show, then this is the film for you. If you're not familiar with the ""Goosebumps"" stories, you will be confused.
Grade: B 8/10 3.5/5 stars"
" ""We're interested in scaring children, but not traumatizing them for life.""
",0.5351,-0.9876,2020-01-22 00:00:00,1,"There is literally no excuse for this other than stupid parents who won't let their children watch anything even the slightest disturbing. This so called, ""family friendly horror film"" consists of nothing but childish filth just slopped into a movie. There is NOTHING remotely creepy I could even find about this. The original Goosebumps, as poorly acted and also not scary as it was, it had moments where my heart started to race. There were moments I found... slightly scary. This is just monsters doing stupid things and people trying to erase them. Now you may be thinking, ""but they're kids they can't handle anything too scary."" Ok first of all shut your overprotective mouth up and secondly they can. Here are some examplesThe Dark Crystal is a dark fantasy movie that contains a scene where characters called The Skeksis watch another of their kind turn to dust and another scene where their slaves, The Podlings, have their souls sent to the Crystal. The Netflix adaptation, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, is even scarier. If you have seen that show, you know that they GO THERE. Like REALLY GO THERE. There are horrific scenes that I don't even want to spoil for you. Thank the people at The Jim Henson Company for not treating kids like fragile pathetic piece of garbage like portrayed here.ANOTHER example is Watership Down, which also has a Netflix adaptation which I have yet to see so I won't talk about it. It contains MURDEROUS BUNNIES that just want to kill every species they see. There's a scene where a rabbit is killed by another rabbit and they show it too. There's terrifying music, a scary narrator, creepily detailed animation, but it still managed to be rated PG. There 2 examples are times when companies didn't treat children like nothing! Unlike this piece of trash.So if you're looking to be surprised by the ""scary"" imadrey, don't get your hopes too high. I absolutely hate what they're doing. There is literally no excuse for this. Even if anything remotely creepy happens, it's sprinkled with filth humor. So if you think that I'm trying to scar children for like, then give the world a big fat favor and screw off. It'll be better with people not like you. Horrible parents raising their children to be soft."

" Goosebumps may not give you a fright, but has enough delight to supply children with a bump in the night.
",0.7871,0.994,2019-07-25 00:00:00,5,"In what may just be the greatest marketing tool for R. L. Stine's series of children's horror novels, Letterman grants us the PG adaptation of 'Cabin in the Woods'. The abominable snowman, a werewolf, evil ventriloquist doll, a colossal praying mantis and even an army of garden gnomes. It's a menagerie of Halloweeny goodness, enough to spark the imagination from the youngest of viewers before the film concludes due to its ridiculous rapid pacing. A group of teenagers and the author of the Goosebumps novels accidentally open various manuscripts that literally transform the ink to reality. With the monsters unleashed, it's up to them to lure the ghouls back in before Slappy the Dummy burns all of the manuscripts, leaving them trapped in the real world forever.If you're like me and have never read a single Goosebumps novel, despite one of the titles being 'I Live in your Basement!' (a phrase I say way too often...), then no need to panic. Turn off Tenacious D, switch over from 'School of Rock' and give it ago. As far as embodying an entire intellectual property goes, Goosebumps is accessible to everyone. Mostly because you'll be enthralled by pointing at the screen and loudly proclaiming ""oh wow, it's a floating vampire poodle!"", and that's where most of the enjoyment lies. The brisk exploration of these creatures, whilst solely powering the plot, brings out the family horror that is the essence of the original source material. Some monsters are better realised than others, the invisible boy and werewolf lacked a certain ""je ne sais quoi"", but on the whole the agglomeration of furry/fleshy/plastic ghouls were intricately designed.The same cannot be said for the human characters however. Unfortunately, the one-dimensional protagonist, his robotically monotonous love interest and his new best friend that irritates more than he entertains, aren't enough to keep me invested in the story. The performances were fine, although Rush was instantly forgettable compared to Minnette and Lee, yet it's the basic screenplay that disallows any personable qualities to be brought forward. The comedy was scattered and rarely landed, mostly because Letterman focused on Black's rip-roaring, insatiable and rather exhausting charisma and the nightly frights. Various plot conveniences, such as Zach's aunt randomly appearing to save the day when the teens were about to be shredded by the werewolf, bring the enjoyment down a smidgen and of course allow for many eye-rolling moments. The third act chucks in as many monsters as possible and diminishes the intensity of the tightly wound second act. Oh, and I counted three jump scares in this family film. Three!So whilst the monstrous thrills were somewhat lacking, the comedy was sporadic and the human characters were more hideous than that pinkish Blob, it does harness the accessibility of Stine's novels and Black is as hyperactive as ever. Which is a good thing, right?"
" A blast from the past...
",0.0,0.9845,2019-07-20 00:00:00,8,Goosebumps is suck a fun and entertaining movie especially for fans of the book series like I was when I was younger. Seeing all the classic monsters from the books coming to life in a movie is so awesome. Jack Black is really good as R.L. Stine and all the monsters working together in the movie is so awesome. Fun survival movie with monsters. The best part is the credits recreating the classic book covers.

Definitely good memories.Overall a decent film, I feared they would oversell the childish teenage lifestyle but they did well for the most part. Odeya Rush is a beautiful addition to the film and does well. Great to see all the monsters being brought to life with Slappy at the forefront. Only criticism is they could have kept it a little darker and not gone full PG for the kids by showing a romantic teenage arc in the end with Dylan and Odeya. You should left it well alone. Still decent and enjoyable. 7/10"

",0.6588,0.967,2019-03-18 00:00:00,7,"So the reason I wanted to watch this movie was that it's premise reminded me a lot to Monster Squad(that I really like) but also to Inkheart(that I hate) so I didn't knew if I wanted to watch it or not. Then I finally watched it and it was pretty good. It starts of really badly and I wanted to turn it off but i kept watching because I was hoping it will get better. Then it got better. The part where the monsters get out and go on their rampage
is really exciting and interesting. Conclusion:
If the sometimes bad comedy and kind of stupid drama doesn't bother you and you like the idea of a bunch of less known monsters coming together kinda like a crossover and destroy stuff then go watch it!"
" EXCELLENT HORROR COMEDY FANTASY FUN!!!
",0.7701,0.9944,2019-02-24 00:00:00,7,"I grew up loving the Goosebumps books from back in the 90's & loved the fun creepy little tales set in suburban neighbourhoods & i always loved the creepy slappy dummy best out of the monsters anyway I'm into my 30's now & was still excited when i heard about a proper Goosebumps movie coming out.I watched Goosebumps with my kids & it's a well made very fun fantasy Horror adventure i loved it!!!!
The comic genius Jack Black was perfect as R.L.Stine he plays the real life Goosebumps writer with a frantic quick witted craziness & full of fun i loved his take on the Horror writer legend.
The kids are great in the cast especially new comer Dylann minette he's a great actor & proved himself as a serious intense actor in the instant classic Horror Thriller Don't Breathe (2016) & the rest are all good & fun but he stands out as a future big lead actor.
Goosebumps has that nice fun 80's monster creature feature feel to it & a nice sense of wonder & adventure!!!
A great family film & a great Goosebumps movie with heart."
" Straight outta 2002.
",0.2263,0.9525,2019-01-30 00:00:00,6,"It's perhaps a stroke of near-genius to adapt all of the eponymous books instead of just one, melding them into a meta narrative surrounding their mysterious author set in a world just one step away from our own. This allows for a lot of fan-service; indeed, pretty much every book-bound creature comes out to play and there are even some subtler references that are actually quite well conceived. Still, that's not all that's on display here as the narrative, while basic, provides a good backdrop for a family-friendly 'haunted house'. 'Goosebumps (2015)' is intermittently fun and Black's performance pushes through most of the sillier stuff - such as its main conceit, which is given as much thought as the two lines of exposition that 'explain' it. It also doesn't feel too self-celebratory, even if there are many lines dedicated to the prowess of Stein's prose and his better-than-King worldwide sales. While the CG might seem slightly dated, it is never distracting and the creative creature designs usually take precedent over the way in which they're rendered. To be fair, the story mainly consists of loosely-connected set-pieces, but it ties itself off nicely and doesn't feel too distracted. I will say that, aside from Black and possibly Lee, the cast aren't all that charismatic, mainly because they don't have much to do aside from scream and run away - which they do convincingly. There aren't any real stakes, despite the fact that there should be, and nobody really gets hurt. However, it's usually enjoyable if you just go along with it. I think fans of the books, which I've never read, will probably get more mileage from it, but I still think it's surprisingly decent. 6/10"

" A fun family horror film
",-0.1027,0.6098,2018-11-23 00:00:00,8,"Goosebumps is a fun family horror film. The scares are tame enough for the kids and the jokes are funny enough for adults. This movie makes you want to read the books all over again, which, now that I think about it, is probably one of the main reasons why this movie was made. However, this movie doesn't feel like a cash grab. It feels like a love letter to the works of R.L. Stine. Goosebumps is worthy to join the ranks of other Halloween family favorites such as The Nightmare Before Christmas, Hocus Pocus and, of course, Ernest Scared Stupid."
" not too bad!

Stine's series of books that which are all literally brought to life in this movie. Jack Black is a bit underrated and does a great job in this movie. He actually makes this movie for me. It is not at all a masterpiece and it is clearly not trying to be. It does not at all suck. It's a good nostalgic movie with laughs and family-level spookiness. It's just a fun movie that does not take itself seriously."
" Instantly forgettable
",0.0,0.9238,2018-10-30 00:00:00,5,"GOOSEBUMPS is a very modern-feeling adaptation of the work of R.L. Stine, the author who had a big hit with his GOOSEBUMPS series of young adult horror novels in the 1990s. I never encountered them - I was too old at the time and went straight for Stephen King instead - but I was willing to give this one a go despite not liking Jack Black as an actor. It turns out to be a play-it-safe production, definitely aimed at young viewers, and one which frequently turns into a sprawling CGI adventure as do so many Hollywood flicks these days. Black plays Stine himself, whose fictional creations come to life and terrorise a small town. The teenage cast members then spend the running time escaping from various monsters. The CGI creations are quite typical of their type; hardly realistic, but some creativity has gone into their look. The film itself is instantly forgettable."

I was skeptical heading into this, but I was surprised at how much I ended up liking it. While not groundbreaking by any means, it is still a nice tribute to the work of R.L. Stine.I actually really enjoyed Jack Black as R.L. Stine. He is definitely not the first actor I would have thought of to play this role, but he gave a nice take on a fictionalized version of the world-famous author.The story is filled with a lot of fairly standard ""coming-of-age"" teenage film tropes. The main teenage characters are hardly anything we haven't seen before, but they are pretty likeable, so it could have been worse. Dylan Minnette and Odeya Rush actually had pretty decent chemistry.I really like the concept of R.L. Stine's stories coming into the real world after being released from their books, and the monsters in this film were pretty darn cool. We get to see Slappy the Dummy, the lawn gnomes, a giant preying mantis, the abominable snowman, the warewolf of Fever Swamp, and many more. The fanservice in this movie is really well done. The only complaint as far as the monsters go is that the CGI used for the warewolf and the abominable snowman was pretty bad.The film moved at a really fast pace, and I really liked the resolution and how everything was wrapped up. You also got to love the cameo by the real R.L. Stine.This film is solid entertainment for the whole family. It's not a masterpiece by any stretch, but it's still a fun ride that I recommend to all ""Goosebumps"" fans.RATING: B"
" A Blast!
",0.0,0.9947,2018-07-24 00:00:00,7,"Without exaggeration, Goosebumps is one of the best comedy movies I've seen in a while. The humor works almost perfectly. Specially, as all the characters are so likable, even Champ who is this kind of dumb characters that are often turn out to be very annoying in many other movies like this. Honestly, sometimes Champ went too far, and some of his jokes fall flat, but that didn't make this character annoying, not in the slightest! I can't believe how many times I laughed out loud! Almost every single joke hits the mark. This movie also is as heartwarming as it is funny. Also, it has some very clever twists and turns that surprised me.Jack Black is so funny, even more funnier than he was in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, IMO.
Dylan Minnette is very good and adorable as always, but if you really want to see him acting, watch Don't Breathe or Netflix's series 13 Reasons Why. Odya Rush also is good, and Jillian Bell is hilarious as aunt Lorraine.Unfortunately, although I was engaged and very entrained in very second in this movie, I didn't really care, or rather worry about the characters. I didn't feel they were in danger. So this movie absolutely doesn't work as a thriller. As a PG-rated horror movie, this movie, of course, doesn't have to scare me. But the problem is that it becomes a bit tedious and lukewarm almost every time it tries to be scary. The visual effects could have been better, but it really don't have to be. Actually, I prefer to see the CGI in this quality, because it fits the campiness and the charming silliness of the movie, just like the original Jumanji. I can't believe how much I liked Goosebumps. I kept putting off watching it, and I thoroughly regret. I can't wait to watch the sequel!(7.5/10)"
" all the characters/actors destroyed this

Any way i watched the show and I loved and was terrified of it, the remake was a huge disappointment. Jack black pulls off one of the worst performances, just the same head shaking and eye brow rising gestures with a stone face, and wheezy, cheesy jokes being spit from his fat mouth just like every movie hes ever been in. Some movies this kinda fits but not this one."

You don't have to be familiar with the works of Stine to appreciate the film filled with puns and corny lines.

" Goosebumps review
",0.0,0.9946,2018-02-04 00:00:00,7,"Goosebumps is a film directed by Rob Letterman. back in 2015, when I watched the film I liked it. It made me remember the Goosebumps series that I had watched back in the 90's. So I decided to watch it again in order to write it a review. I again felt the same.Plot: RL Stine teams up with a group of tenagers to stop his monsters from creating havoc in the town of Madison.Story and direction: I haven't read the Gossebumps books, but still I can say that this was an enjoyable film. The comedy was spot on. I chucked on most of the jokes that were cracked. Also most of the characters were quite likable> we get to see the kinds of similarities that both Rl Stine and Zach face. LAos dealt with quite greatly is the mother-son dynamic between Zach and his mother. I hope that aspect would have been explored more. The creatures wre quite entertaining in their own way. But sometimes while watching I felt that there was a big VFX creature being watched. The VFX was very superficial in some places that irritated me a lot. Also I felt that I didn't have so many memorable moments in the film that would make the film last long in my mind. Performances: Jack Black once again stole the show for me. He nailed it as R L Stine. HIs voice work as Slappy and the Invisible Boy were on point. Dylan Minette was great too. Same can be said for Odeya Rush and Ryan Lee. Why was Jillian Bell taken also is not yet understood by me. Both the actors who portrayed police officers were also OK. I hoped that Amy Ryan get more screen time. It was good to see RL Stine (the original Goosebumps author) get a screen time.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene depicting the small conversation between Zach and R L Stine to depict how similar they are. That scene touched me a bit.Verdict: Goosebumps is a very enjoyable film. Don't keep any expectations while watching the film. Keep a free mind while watching this venture, you will surely be entertained by it.I am going with a 7.5/10."
" Everything from Aliens to Zombies.
",0.0,0.9897,2018-01-23 00:00:00,6,"The small town of Madison, Delaware is over-run by monsters that escape from the manuscripts of children's horror author R.L. Stine (Jack Black), and it is up to teenagers Zach (Dylan Minnette), Champ (Ryan Lee) and Hannah (Odeya Rush) to try and save the day.Whilst nothing spectacular or original in terms of story (see Jumanji and The Twilight Zone episode 'A World of His Own' for similar ideas done decades earlier), Goosebumps will no doubt please its intended audience - youngsters - and may very well appeal to older viewers who, like me, still embrace their inner child (I was born about twenty years too soon to enjoy Goosebumps for nostalgic reasons, but as old as I am now, I've never grown out of my love for movie monsters).With diminutive animated garden gnomes and a colossal preying mantis, and everything in between, there's more than enough creepy creature fun in this fantasy adventure to keep one entertained for the duration. Some of the CGI special effects are far from perfect (the Abominable Snowman and the wolfman are pretty ropey) and Jack Black teeters on annoying (nothing new there), but the fast pace and likeable teenage characters ensure that boredom never sets in."
" A Fun, Fairy Tale Entertainment
",0.7269,0.9907,2017-12-02 00:00:00,7,"This movie surpassed my expectation since I didn't feel much buzz when I viewed the trailer. What ticks for the movie is it's lots of fun especially when the monsters are released from the writer's book. These creatures and their antics can easily engross children's attention without scaring them away. But at the same time, it isn't boring either and adults can get hooked too. Jack Black as the mysterious writer Stine holds the film together very well and he has a certain charisma too that gives the movie its success. Dylan Minnette is good as the neighbor kid Zach who befriend's Stine's daughter. And Israeli actor Odeya Rush as the daughter Hannah is very pretty and expressive too. This isn't some great thriller or action adventure and I felt the presence of too many monsters or figures wasn't really necessary & distracts. Yet, Goosebumps keeps you & your family entertained with the fairy tale like story and the humor. Verdict - a nice movie to rent out for the kids."
" Scary
",-0.4939,0.9664,2017-08-20 00:00:00,9,This not a blood movie. But it is a very scary movie. And it has great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. It is scarier then The silences of the lambs could ever be. 6.3 is a good ratting. But this such a good movie that 6.3 is underrating it. If you like to get scared see this movie. It is scarier then A Nightmare on elm street and that is not easy to do. It is scarier then Friday the 13th V a new beginning and that is not easy to do. It is scarier then Halloween resurrection could ever be. See this movie. It is a great fantasy movie. It will scary you. Because it one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.
" It's Slappy's revenge...
",0.0,0.9978,2017-06-15 00:00:00,6,"Initially I was a little bit concerned about watching ""Goosebumps"" given the fact that it had Jack Black in one of the bigger roles. I am not really much of a fan of his, but I will say that he was actually good in this movie, and it was nice to see him out of the usual comedy genre that he performs in.Granted that this is a movie aimed at a family and young viewer audience, so you have a cast ensemble of relatively young acting performers. It should be said that they had cast the talents quite well, because the actors and actresses were doing good jobs with their given roles and characters.The storyline in ""Goosebumps"" was good and fun. I found it to be an interesting plot to have an authors creations from his books come to life when the books are opened. However, to have the author based on the actual author of the Goosebumps series was just a bit too silly. An homage to the iconic writer perhaps? I would hope so. But still a bit too out there.The CGI special effects and creature designs were just spectacular. It was such an amazing sight to witness this kind of spectacular visuals on the screen. There were so many wonderful details to each of the creature. The special effects alone more than make it well worth to watch the 2015 ""Goosebumps"" movie.The music score found in ""Goosebumps"" was also quite good, and very fitting to the movie. The music was very atmospheric and supplemented the various scenes and events that took place on the screen. But of course, with Danny Elfman composing the music, what else could be expected?""Goosebumps"" is a fun and wholesome movie for the entire family, and it is especially fun if you have read any of the Goosebump books, or at least is familiar with the books. It appeals to young and adult viewers alike, so that was a great accomplishment for director Rob Letterman.The movie is fast paced and never really paces down to a dull pace. So expect a fast thrill ride with lots of up and downs as the various creatures spring from the pages of the books."

" A boring, unfunny mess. Do NOT recommend
",-0.7105,0.963,2017-02-14 00:00:00,3,"Overall: This movie is very boring and I laughed at maybe two jokes. This is a comedy. Two funny jokes in a comedy is abysmal. Some will enjoy this movie and its humour but I absolutely despised it.Good: 1. The idea is very interesting and unique and could have made a great movie. It didn't, but it could have.2. Slappy was an excellent choice for a villain3. Jack Black gave a decent performance4. Two jokes made me smile5. The CGI is decentBad:1. This movie is labelled as Comedy/Horror. The film delivers in neither. 2. The cinematography was pretty bad. I do not need 40 different angles on an SUV driving down a road.3. The characters were boring.4. Other than Jack Black, the actor didn't do it much better.5. Odeya Rush's acting was abysmal and she clearly just wanted a paycheck.6.

" Some good family flick humor
",0.6124,0.9721,2017-01-22 00:00:00,7,"This is basically a monsters movie with the combination of a lot of the ""Goosebumps"" monsters coming to life. For the most part I was entertained and if I saw this as a kid in elementary I would have loved it. Mainly because the ""Goosebumps"" books was really popular when I was in elementary. And a movie that combines a lot of the monsters would have been awesome. I can however still see kids having a fun time sitting through this one. Because it isn't full of trashy and overly corny dialogues that even kids would cringe at. Instead the humor for the most part works for a family film. What would have been great is if they delved more into the monsters background and how it effects the lead characters. Maybe such as if they have to go through a haunted house or had one of the characters put on The Haunted Mask which effected the group. Instead of just running around and hiding from the the ""Goosebumps"" monsters. I still think this is a good family flick that had potential to be really good. At least the humor for the most part hits it's mark.7/10"
" Balances Family-Friendly Horror With Enough Surprises to be Fun
",0.128,0.9983,2017-01-09 00:00:00,8,"Even though I read my share of Goosebumps books as a kid, I still didn't run out to see Goosebumps. I don't remember the specific characters except the most famous ones (e.g. Slappy the dummy). The other reason is because even though I like Jack Black, his really good movies are few and far between. I checked this out on-demand and I'm honestly happy I did. This movie ended up being a lot better than I thought it would be. It knows how to celebrate the spirit of R.L. Stine's work, there's some surprisingly solid acting from the cast and they put some work into the relationships between the characters that would normally make my eyes roll.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* It's a beautiful day as Zach (Dylan Minnette) and his mom Gale (Amy Ryan) move into their new house in Madison, Delaware. They've decided to try and get a fresh start after a tragedy strikes their family and moving from New York City to a small town seems like just the ticket. Zach is less than thrilled about it and reluctantly carries in boxes from the truck. He's trying to wrap his head around the transition and his kooky Aunt Lorraine (Jillain Bell) when he unexpectedly makes contact with his neighbour Hannah (Odeya Rush). She seems to get him immediately but before their conversation gets too far, her dad Stine (Jack Black) yells at her to get back in the house.Movies geared towards families often lack the bite to appeal to adults. This isn't news and if you're looking for some dark horror here, my first question is why? Knowing the source material is the key (as is watching any of the material in the marketing). I think the movie hit the right counterbalance between soft-balling it in and pushing the envelope too far. There are some monsters here that would be pretty scary for the younger kids but as an adult, there's nothing frightening here. It's about right for the audience it's intended for, they wring some laughs out of what's supposed to be some of the scarier scenes. The monsters and villains from the Goosebumps novels are pictured on the screen in imaginative ways that are fun to watch, even when they're trying to stab, eat or maim our heroes.The concept of Stine's books coming to life might seem lame but it reminded me of classic movies that had a lot of imagination. They don't give the audience a concrete explanations on why is this is possible? How could this happen? (it made me think of BIG with Tom Hanks, he grew up all of a sudden because... magic?). But it grew on me as the movie went on. The creative team introduces the concept and then they largely play by their own rules. You never get a chance to ask too many questions because the movie does move along at a decent clip when stuff starts falling apart in Madison, Delaware.Another area this movie could have fumbled the ball is dealing with the characters. You've got a lot of your cliché plot-lines for a coming-of-age tale: the strained relationship between the parent and their kid, the teenage romance where the new kid in town falls in love with the shut-in etc. But this movie was refreshing in how they decided to deal with those well-worn stories. Instead of the typical ""you don't get me"" stuff, Gale and Zach still have a loving relationship, even though it has it's problems. They joke and deal with their difficulties together and I appreciated that. Another example is how the relationship between R.L. Stine and Slappy is explained. We grow to learn that Slappy is just a shadowy reflection of Stine (authors draw from what they know) and he represents Stine's inability to connect with people and how that's frustrated him even to this day. Not every subplot avoids pitfalls, Zach and Hannah's budding romance has been done over and over again in other movies. But the movie does a good job on not concentrating on it too long and they keep it moving by adding a few jokes or throwing a new twist in to avoid stagnation.I was also impressed by the cast in Goosebumps. You would think Jack Black would mug his way through this material but he's more nuanced and funny in this than the marketing lets on. He carries certain scenes in this movie easily and it's easy to forget how good he is if he's cast in the right role. Dylan Minnette and Odeya Rush were decent as Zach and Hannah. The fact that they were teenage leads falling in love would normally be enough to lose my interest but they worked well together and apart. I thought Ryan Lee was funny but he was really over-doing it in certain bits. Jillian Bell was also solid in her small role, I'm liking her more and more. Amy Ryan also hit the right notes for her character to be effective.Lastly and maybe most importantly, the movie is pretty funny when it wants to be. The script seems to know when it's okay to wink at the audience. It doesn't hurt that you have guys like Jack Black delivering the dialogue but with all the rapid-fire jokes being fired at you, the hit-miss ratio was notably higher than I expected (minus some pretty awful puns by Slappy).Goosebumps could have been really awful. It could have been just an attempt to boost the sales of the books and the studio could have just done the bare-minimum to turn a profit. It wasn't though and I can see why it ended up being a minor hit. They put their own spin on some well-travelled concepts and they made a good decision to couple it with some quickly paced humour and some appropriate to the source material horror. Goosebumps turned out to be some decent entertainment after all."
" Enjoyable but forgettable
",0.2382,0.9019,2017-01-05 00:00:00,5,"I went to the cinema to watch this movie, and although I spent two pleasant hours, I thought it wasn't good enough for me to pay for a movie ticket, more for me to rent it and watch it at home.Goosebumps is an entertaining funny-horror teen movie fit for the whole family. Although I enjoyed the film, there wasn't anything that I considered out of the ordinary, not the story line, not the performances, not the humour, and not even the special effects. Just fun, no super-fun. Clichéd monsters, characters, situations, and adventures. Not great performances either, but there are three people who stood out for me: Ryan Lee as the over-confident flirt likable looser Champ; Amy Ryan as Gale (Zac's mother), and the manipulator & voice of Slappy the Dummy. Nevertheless, enjoyable!"
