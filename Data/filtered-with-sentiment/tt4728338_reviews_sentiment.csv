" Below Expectations
",0.0,-0.5423,2019-06-18 00:00:00,6,"I'm a big fan of Cem Yilmaz, but this movie is of lower quality than I expected. It could be the worst movie I've ever seen from Cem Yilmaz. We enjoy it from time to time, but this can not be Cem Yilmaz film."
" Common Boring Movie by Cem YILMAZ
",-0.3182,0.8658,2019-02-27 00:00:00,4,"Whenever I watch Cem YILMAZ and want to laugh, I am disappointed. Its scenario as well as acting is lower than expected.Cem YILMAZ has two masterpieces: Yahsi Bati and Arog. Apart from these two movies, it is better to watch his stand-up shows, not his movies.Most of the time, he chooses same players to work with in his movies. This is why he cannot come up with innovation."
" Cem's movies have become increasingly ordinary.
",0.0,-0.2208,2018-12-03 00:00:00,6,"Cem's first films, such as G.O.R.A and A.R.O.G, are a masterpiece for the history of Turkish movies. However, in 2015 and later, we see that the attraction in his films has disappeared. He now produces films for his commercial concern. We can say this by looking at the increase his films in recent years. And their latest films are not as effective as their old movies. I'm not saying anything to his direction or editing, he's above standards. But I think he should do a self criticism as well. I think this film has nothing to distinguish it from other Turkish films. A kind of movie that people can watch when they get bored."
" What does the zombie have to do with this film ?
",0.0,0.4939,2018-11-24 00:00:00,4,Only CEM Yilmaz fans should watch. The movie is full of crap. It could be because it was a comedy movie. But zombies are irrelevant. Looks like it was added later.
