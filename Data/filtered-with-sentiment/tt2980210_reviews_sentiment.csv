" It was going great until...
",0.6249,0.992,2021-04-12 00:00:00,7,"The funny and dynamic rapport with Yousef - which was... let's face it- not stereotypical. At least not in the extent of Kumail Nanjiani in Stuber or that Indian-taxi driver stereotype from Deadpool. It showed it is perfectly natural for a Saudi driver to know Chicago or for that matter the parties behind closed door with booze and all.The running gag of him falling even humored me. It was beauitfully photographed and visually stunning. But the moment they had to inject typical Hollywidazation romance it completed turned the whole thing sour like acid in milk.Why does it ALWAYS have to include that dynamic? Can a single movie not be made that focuses on ""missed"" connections or chances or say just the cherished bond of friendship?As a reviewer pointed out there was no way such deep, steamy romance can happen in 2 weeks between people from two vastly different background. Whereas Bill Murray's Lost In Translation was complete cringe fest thanks to Sopfia Copolla and also Salmon Fishing in Yemen is similar in nature (actually that was very predictable too...) this was a decent watch and I did not find it slow.I mean... just like they had to ruin the movie ""The Magic Of Belle Isle"" this recurring force feeding of Hollywood of interracial/intercultural romance down our throats really need to be stopped. It could have easily gotten 10 had they didn't put that dumb twist of a romance at the end."
" Worst movie I have ever seen
",-0.6249,-0.296,2021-04-05 00:00:00,1,Terrible.it had no plot and was everywhere. Never watch again or do it.
" Different but ok
",0.4215,0.5719,2021-01-28 00:00:00,6,Interesting to view the portrayal of Saudi Arabia. Tom Hanks plays a different type of role.
" A movie about humans
",0.0,0.705,2020-12-24 00:00:00,8,"Nice and sweet movie. The narrative may seem pointless (as you can read from other reviews) but the beauty of the picture lays somewhere else.
The biggest disappointment in my view is the very discutable casting choice of having non-Arab actors playing Arab characters. Just why?"
" The King and I
",0.0,0.5197,2020-12-19 00:00:00,3,"I was surprised to learn this movie is a comedy. There is nothing funny about this film. Tom Hanks character, Alan, is a salesman on the verge of breakdown who is dealing with a bitter ex wife (why is she bitter it is never explained) and a clueless annoying boss who wants to get the deal done soon as possible.Tom Hanks carried this movie, he made it interesting to watch. If it was another actor who did not have Hank's charm, the movie would have fallen flat.It does have an interesting premise to it however it went nowhere. The car ride to his first day of work was longer than it should have been. His ""team"" were lackluster background characters. The party at the Denmark embassy was over the top ridiculous and unnecessary. On top of that, Alan was totally clueless regarding the culture and costumes' of Saudi Arabia. He made numerous social mistakes that I was amazed he was not thrown out of the country by the end of the film.I did read the movie was based on a book. I am curious to read the book and see how the film holds up to it."
" A fun adventure in the desert
",0.6808,0.5927,2020-11-14 00:00:00,9,"This is one of those movies that seem meandering and you keep asking yourself what it is supposed to mean, but it's the good kind of meandering and only Tom Hanks could make it so."
" New Hampshire error
",-0.4019,-0.2031,2020-10-20 00:00:00,8,"I found this movie very enjoyable and watchable, and I have a short attenti9n span for movies that are not very watchable. Being a New Englander I have to comment on the ending. Tom Hanks was relating a story of camping with his father and said they went to a ""National Park"" in New Hampshire"" and they were worried about ""Wolves and Bears"" - There are NO National Parks in NH (They may have been thinking of the White Mountain National FOREST"") And there are black bears in New Hampshire, but no wolves at all.. Simple fact checking, but most didn't catch this I bet."
" Tragedy
",-0.6597,-0.8204,2020-10-07 00:00:00,3,I give it a 3 because Tom Hanks is in it. If it wasn't for him it would be a 1. Utterly boring and terrible. Just goes on and on and you want it to end quickly. Painful
" 'Propaganda paid for by a King' would be a more fitting title
",-0.25,-0.9219,2020-09-14 00:00:00,2,"Propaganda flick to paint Saudi Arabia in a good light while turning China into the villain. This film was so ahead of its time! I bet a silly little Saudi prince who paid for this film and doesn't even know that the demons he paid to make this are going to double cross him soon enough. These fools really believe that their demon partners view them as equals? I almost feel bad for them. What fools. As far as this film goes, it is forgettable. Seriously, I just remember Tom Hanks driving in a cab for 2 hours."
" Lost in Translation 2.0
",-0.3182,-0.4019,2020-08-24 00:00:00,4,"Full of stereotypes and a very slow story line. Sorry Hanks, in a stellar career, this one's a flop."

Making sure no bomb each time before starting engine? Massive disco party in Danish Embassy ?
Female Muslim doctor checking foreigner? Taxi driver with desire of democratic movement...... What?
Where is the beautiful Isramic spirit of giving and welcoming? Not a single scene...
Directors must have had unwilling bitter personal experiences in Saudi / with Arabic people.It's American film for American people. I am very well convinced that most of the scenes were filmed in Morrocco, not in Saudi."
" Another wonderful interpretation of Tom Hanks
",0.5719,0.9851,2020-07-14 00:00:00,8,"A hologram for the King - by Tom Tykwer and referring to his excellent movie - Cloud Atlas - (2013) is two things, this story is simple, maybe too simple, but what about the wonderful performance of ""Tom Hanks ""who once again flaunts all his acting talent here, he is the movie to finish with his presence and his magnificent performance, just for that, the film is much better than the notes than him are unjustly attributed, of course each is his own free will, but let's still remain logical: strong points: the realization, the photography and the wonderful performance of his actor. Negative point, an ordinary story. But just for the performance of Tom Hanks, the movie deserves to be seen and reviewed."
" This is a fairy tale.
",0.0,0.891,2020-07-12 00:00:00,5,Looks like the director had an oriental dream about an eastern love affair. This story can never take place in Saudi Arabia. The rest of the movie is funny though. This is why I gave 5/10

" A truly awful film
",-0.0258,-0.91,2020-06-07 00:00:00,1,Did any of the production team or scriptwriters ever visit Saudi? Just about every conceivable mistake / stereotype / howler was included and the plot was appallingly weak. Can't think how it ever got to be released. Frankly this film is a total embarrassment.
" Really? First bad TH movie for me !
",-0.6212,0.6212,2020-05-06 00:00:00,4,I did not want to believe the user reviews because I love Tom Hanks. This was not the one though ! It is upsetting that it leaves unfinished so many items that are started truly for nothing in this abrupt end . Let this one go....
" A hologram for the king : DeJaVu
",0.0,0.4304,2020-04-28 00:00:00,6,"This is a ""Tom Hanks"" film.So seeing him itself is enough sometimes for film goers like me. (His charm and quirky acting with emotions are outstanding.)But this is just like DeJa Vu for me reminding me of ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen (2011)"".Same cultural clash with a more positive vibes from both countries.Tom Hanks pulled off a good job. The depiction of substance of the story was the issue.We see a man in a mid-life crisis and trying to sell a holographic communication device to a Saudi king. We see his internal family problems, his past career failures and also his inner struggle that goes with same existential issues that is discussed in many films.But this is a hollywood film and it's not always the style what I as a viewer expect. Tom Tykwer as a director is innovative, We see some innovative visual takes in this film, but we get the feeling of repetition in this film.Anyway though it felt repetitive it was a majestic in cinematographic achievement.Well you can't expect everything right.Overall - 3/5"
" Interesting and original but quite limited
",-0.0745,0.9356,2020-04-18 00:00:00,6,"Tom Hanks plays a fish-out-of-water businessman in this tale of culture shock, self-doubt and discovery. Set amidst the flat desert plains of Saudi Arabia, Hanks aims to mend his financial struggles by selling an absentee king on a gimmicky hologram-driven teleconferencing solution. Along the way, he encounters no shortage of roadblocks, be they personal, bureaucratic, cultural or medical, and eventually recognizes it as a growth opportunity. This is a conflicted picture, much in the same way our leading man plays a conflicted individual. Nailing down a steady tone seems difficult; the film opens with a loose, cartoonish musical number, then settles into a fast-paced corporate shuffle before cutting that loose and becoming a warm-hearted buddy picture and, finally, a contemplative romance. All this in a very trim, quick ninety minutes. Social norms are a steady focus, shining a flashlight on the immense gap between everyday life as an American and as a Saudi, but in the end it feels like those are only superficial, easily brushed aside to make way for a happy ending. That climax leaves us with dozens of loose ends, half-heartedly explored threads that are inspected and discarded like an inattentive child digging through his toybox. It all feels very loose and light, like we've read a summary but not the entire story. There's a compelling yarn buried somewhere within A Hologram for the King, but we only skim the surface. Interesting and original but quite limited."
" As one reviewer said...
",0.0,-0.2182,2020-04-10 00:00:00,5,"Is there such a thing as a bad Tom Hanks film? Well yes, apparently there is, and unfortunately this is it. Not knowing that this was a book adaptation, or anything else about it, I was solely interested in watching because it was probably the only Hanks movie I had not seen. With that said, I have indeed seen everything Tom Hanks has done. He is a tremendous actor who typically does not play in bad movies. Try as I might, I could not get interested. Painfully slow, and just not good."
" Saved me a trip to Saudi Arabia
",0.4215,0.8176,2020-03-12 00:00:00,8,"I nearly visited Saudi Arabia on holiday but thank God I saw this film and it informed me about this country.As soon as the film's end credits rolled I called my travel agent and cancelled my trip, and I then instructed my agent to book me a trip to Benidorm instead."
" Scandal
",-0.4404,-0.9068,2020-02-08 00:00:00,1,The worst movie ever created. No story no plot no actors and lack of facts. Shame on Tom Hanks to be in this movie. How can such a successful actor agree on such shamble. The movie should be taken down and deleted from history. What a waste of 2 hours no benefit nor entertainment in this show would have rated it lower if I could.
" Yet another western cultural imperialistic film of mythology
",0.0,0.9894,2020-02-05 00:00:00,1,"Yes she looked so Saudi. They fooled someone. Honestly now what are the chances of an old tired fat white man with a bump on his back and no money going to Saudi and pulling a rich leading surgeon Saudi citizen? They must be desperate? Chances run in the trillions, for anyone who knows Saudi culture. But white men still have this fantasy of easy conquest of the bodies of non-white women. They love to show how easy women are. Like Saudi women are easy and sip wine and swim naked just to get a old white man. Silly little film. And the two themes alcohol in the kingdom and sex. Shortage of Arab actors does not stop with the good old Dr with loose morals, even the taxi driver is played by a white male. What a sophisticated film this really is. This is the real reason Chinese are winning in. Arab countries because they come for the money and respect the culture they taking it from. Oh no Tom and his firm who mock the laws of the land and how many times does this ""access to alcohol"" theme get played out in one film? It must be a vodka advert. In addition to all of that the film has no direction and they could have made it into a short where absolutely nothing of consequence happens. Without Hanks the film is unwatchable."
" Meh!
",-0.1511,0.5831,2020-01-04 00:00:00,5,Had this a while and never watched it and now that I have it was just meh! not one of Tom Hanks better ones and wouldnt have been missed if I had never seen it.
" Very stereotyping and inconvenient
",-0.3947,0.7069,2019-10-21 00:00:00,2,"I am not a Saudi citizen,yet any arab would clearly know that the movie is very stereotyping Saudi people.Its very clear that dr. Zahra isn't Saudi as it appears in her Arab words which isn't a good arab accent let alone Saudi accent.Such a relationship between Hanks and the dr is nearly impossible, she's married saudi woman and even if she's not married, saudis women don't take strangers to their beach houses, swim with them topless and have such affair!!You have to respect the audience, and show a real image about the country you're filming about."
" Nothing happened
",0.0,-0.8122,2019-10-21 00:00:00,2,The movie title is very misleading. The direction of the story keeps on changing until the end when you realize there was no story at all and you just sat there for almost 2 hours staring at a blank screen having your time wasted.
" Just bad...
",0.0,-0.3323,2019-10-09 00:00:00,1,"I don't even know where to start. The whole movie was, in summary, leading nowhere, at least in my opinion. In hindsight it was mainly about Tom Hanks being drunk over and over in Saudi Arabia (even though NOTHING was filmed there except a few outdoor scenes). And middle aged women who (with absolutely no chemistry between them) falling for him. I especially was disappointed that he went with the unattractive Indian actress (playing a Saudi woman in divorce) who (I must confess) reminded me of my grandma (yeah, I'm of Indian background) instead going with the cute lady from Denmark. The only amusing facts were, that I filmed at the location of the pool party, too, which is in Berlin, Germany, and even funnier, together with one of the camera men of this movie :-DOverall, a very disappointing film from Hanks. I absolutely don't know why he did it, it can't be money - at least I hope so."
" A Solid Enough Performance From Tom Hanks In One Of His Weaker Movies
",-0.3182,0.9674,2019-08-25 00:00:00,5,"Basically what this movie offers is exactly what you're expecting to get when you decide to watch it: a very solid performance from Tom Hanks, who always offers a very solid performance. What doesn't get offered in this movie, though, is any truly compelling story. Hanks plays salesman Alan Clay. Clay is down on his luck. His career is going nowhere fast, except possibly downhill, and his personal life is a mess. He gets a chance to right himself when he's asked to go to Saudi Arabia by his company to sell some sort of holographic teleconferencing system to the Kingdom in a new city being built by the king as an economic hub.This is meant, I think, to be a comedy. And at times it is mildly amusing. Clay has to deal with the culture shock that is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and with a whole lot of insane bureaucratic red tape and various Saudi officials who don't really seem all that interested in doing anything for him or even meeting with him. Meanwhile, Clay's accompanied by his driver Yousef, who also manages to inject a little bit of humour. But there's not enough humour, and it's interspersed with a lot of pretty heavy stuff - a growth Clay has on his back, the related medical problem, the ongoing drama of his troubled relationship with his ex-wife and daughter, his declining career. It's as if every now and then, just as the story is starting to feel just a little bit light and fun, a decision was made to not let it be too much fun. The introduction of the romance between Clay and the female Saudi doctor also seemed off to me; it really didn't fit the story at all. It was awkward. And regardless of Hanks' solid performance, I felt nothing for his character. How this would ultimately turn out for Clay really didn't interest me - and since that's really what the story is all about, it was a major weakness.It's a decent enough performance from Hanks - and it provides a glimpse of Saudi culture and a sense of what it must be like as a westerner to travel there (but unlike some movies set in foreign countries it gave me no desire whatsoever to actually visit Saudi Arabia.) But at the same time I'd have to say that it's one of Hanks' weaker movies. (5/10)"
" just meh

Slow story with no real direction and relatively meagre cast. Predictable happy ending. Probably Hanks worse since The Circle (and who wrote that screenplay?).

Hanks' performance was very good, as he managed to make us both laugh and sad at moments, perfectly getting across the worried character that he is and helping us feel how he feels.

" Not a masterpiece, but enjoyable and easy-watching.
",-0.6435,0.8839,2019-02-26 00:00:00,6,"It is a movie that you will forget very soon. There is nothing new and it made me fell that I was waiting all the time for something to happen. Also, there is a strange atmosphere in the movie, like everyone is plotting against Tom Hanks.BUT, once you understand that that is the goal of the movie (lack of plot twist, the strange atmosphere, etc.), it becomes kinda enjoyable (I wish I had understood that sooner to better enjoy the history). And I think the ""strange atmosphere"" is done due the big different of culture in Saudi Arabia, so that is a big pro. It have a nice photography and good acting, and they show a lot of culture of Saudi Arabia (I think that is one of the best in this movie. It's similar to a documentary, in that aspect).There is no strong comedy or drama, although they should cut some of the drama there, but, If you don't expect too much and want to watch something unpretentiously you can watch this film."

If you think it as a familiar drama it's very shallow, the letters between father and daughter don't give much information.

" A Film Out of Our Experience
",0.0,0.9709,2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,"25 April 2016. The title of this movie didn't help market itself unless one had already seen the movie. That's a big problem, a movie title. Subsequently though this more substantive version of Lost in Translation (2003) that includes much more of a relational component offers up a pungent and enlightening as well as dramatic collision of two cultures. Along with a nice comedic tone with dramatic and sometimes fearful moments, Holograph does nicely with sustaining the audience's interest and revealing an entertaining, intriguing storyline about a wonderful but frustrating business opportunity in Saudi Arabia. This perhaps fictional behind the scenes look at Saudi culture is fascinating and the relational story lines are also quite compelling, if not perhaps completely believable.Unlike Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Holograph offers a duality between strikingly different cultures. Unlike Roman Holiday (1953), Holograph offers a more equitable status between characters who are more identifiable to a average American audience while at the same time highlighting the delicate and sometimes comical and serious cultural barriers. Another culture clash movie, Fear and Trembling (2003) perhaps comes closest to the revelation and exposure of the intimate dynamics of the differences in ethnic behavior and attitudes. Fear and Trembling however is much more focused as a serious cultural study whereas Holograph is more fluid and mainstream Hollywood in its presentation but in a good way.In sum, Holograph is an insightful and delightful look into the interactions between the personal cultural differences along with a basic meaningful human sameness undertone of invaluable importance."
" A real deal, meaningful experience
",0.3182,0.9638,2019-01-05 00:00:00,10,"The story is crisp and authentic. Saudi Arabia is about as surreal as it gets. I had a business trip stay there two decades ago that was eerily similar to what Hanks portrays, and this movie captures that. Hanks does his usual magic, and his Saudi driver/guide/friend portrayed by Omar Elba is exceptionally delightful. Add some superb visuals and a touching romance for spice with a Saudi doctor exquisitely played by Sarita Choudhury, and the result is a satisfying, well-rounded entertainment."

There were some strange/quirky characters doing slightly amusing/comedic things. Then all those characters disappear and it turns into a romantic drama out of NOWHERE. I could not believe it. I've never seen something so pathetic with such a quality cast. I gave it 2 stars because the acting and the production was alright. The story/plot/etc. was just awful.I watched because Rotten Tomatoes gave it 73%, even 'Top Critics' was at 67%.

When I first read the description it really didn't tell me much or make me want to watch it. There was several parts of the movie where I find it need some explanations. One of them was when Alan, Yousef, and his clan were going to hunt wolves. The scene when Yousef and his clan were praying, Alan was on the lookout for the wolves. Alan verifies several times regarding the wolve, then the scene ends jumping into something else. So it was never clarified what end up happening back there for Alan, Yousef, and his clan. Also it didn't explain why are people who Alan is doing business with are lying. It almost makes you feel like it is the norm there for that to happen there. Maybe it is or isn't, can't really tell.The film overall was a bit dry but still watchable. Sadly when the movie was speaking in Arabic, there weren't any translation in the subtitles.

Unlike many viewers, I don't see why every TH movie has to be a ""hit"". I found the Saudi Arabian locale and characters fascinating, wondering how they manage to build such opulent structures in a desert. To continue the holographic metaphor, the projected new-city-in-the-desert was more of a mirage than a reality.I understand why critics at Rotten Tomatoes give it a 73% fresh rating: it is different and critics like that. Only 55% of the audience at RT enjoyed it because they were expecting something different, and audiences don't like that. As other reviewers have mentioned, the plot meanders and goes in odd directions. But that is part of the quirky attraction for me, at least. While the story ends a bit abruptly (too nicely/neatly?), Tom Hank's character is a sympathetic one that the audience willingly roots for."

I have traveled overseas and seen some incredible historical places. Not everything that glitters is gold. A movie can be amazing without having the kind of Hollywood drama Americans have come to expect; no car chases and explosions and sexy criminal activity are required. A movie can be touching, weird, loving, surprising, fascinating, and gentle and still be profound. Hanks took this role because he knew the deeper story is genius. If you aren't an old soul, don't watch it. But if you love good storytelling, with a foreign culture and some rich cinematography, give this one a try. It's beautiful."

" A Hollowgram For the Viewer.
",0.0,0.1136,2018-04-06 00:00:00,5,"Pacing, structure and subject matter were off with this film. It was enjoyable enough really, however, its implementation was faulty and the directing, messy.Watching this movie, it started to feel a lot like a Sci-Fi Psychological Mystery Thriller, given the combination of the way in which the King was always being absent, the flashbacks, breaking chairs, ""reasons"" for constantly waking up late, the bump on his back and the overall tone of this film; even worse, how that receptionist was behaving.E.g. There was a scene where the receptionist adamantly and unapologetically said that Karim was in New York. A scene later, we find that Karim is in the very same building. Upon Alan meeting Karim, Karim seemed quite eerie. As they walk back to reception, while Alan is talking about the receptionist, she is now no longer by her desk, with the laptop off, as if, nobody was actually ever there to begin with, then as he passes, Karim doesn't even bother to look at the receptionists desk. A desk by the way, that is literally just a single desk in the middle of the foyer. And don't even get me started on the condos construction site.A Hologram For the King is funny at points, not too many though, however, there isn't much to follow in this film. What you thought it was, turns out it's not, and what it is, happens a bit late, and thus adds to what is an abrupt ending to this movie. His relationship with Yousef, the presentation, the deal and his communication with his daughter, end about the same as that wife, car and home in the beginning of the movie. 5/10."
" Pretty and occasionally thought-provoking Hanks vehicle, lapsing into incongruousness
",0.4939,0.996,2018-04-02 00:00:00,7,"One of those European films that chooses an American star to look more acceptable for American audiences, German Director Tom Tykwer's ""A Hologram for the King"" still looks irredeemably continental, with all the pluses and minuses that that entails.Basically, that means visually interesting, thought-provoking, weird, and not always seeming to make perfect sense!Primarily, Hanks plays (pretty straight, if with moments of comedy) a US businessman working at high level in sales, whose life has been uneven and seems to have gone into a bit of a downward spiral as middle age takes hold. Tellingly, and perhaps as a highlight of this film, Hanks's face glues on a broader and broader smile as he meets his more-youthful team each day, notwithstanding the weird and trying circumstances all are facing as they set up - VERY slowly - to make a high-tech sales pitch in Saud Arabia.Also importantly, our man Alan Clay is both a purveyor and a victim of globalisation, and this topic looms large a couple of times in the film (including at its - again telling - end). Globalisation has put a barrier between Alan and his traditionalist father and is of course what explains Alan's globetrotting in the first place. He is present in countries with Western-looking hotels and advertising hoardings on the surface, but with actually an entirely different culture just (a few millimetres) below that surface.Where ""weird"" is concerned, well that word is liable to arise from time to time in the watcher of this film (most especially on the scene of a party for diplomats who apparently respond to the strain of their somewhat repressive posting by abandoning absolutely all inhibitions!) But of course the weirdness does not stand in the way of what can at times be absolutely beautiful filming, featuring many scenes of simply gorgeous places where the desert meets the sea.Except that it is not THAT desert and not THAT sea, for this piece is filmed in Morocco (and Egypt), but only a little in Saudi; and that's a deflating discovery, as a key pleasure for the filmgoer is to cogitate on what Saudi Arabia is like. The best we can do here is imagine ... on the basis of concocted Arabia-like locations, and that's a great pity.Presumably, the distance from the true locations offered the artistic distance necessary to achieve the somewhat negative and critical portrayal that we get here, of Saudis as haughty, enigmatic, unpredictable, unreliable (at least from a Western point of view), restricters of rights, users of the death penalty and so on ... as well as of course super-rich! In turn, their kingdom is portrayed here - perhaps authentically - as an edgy place in which various people fear various things, but also endlessly try to ""get round"" impositions. There's thus considerable hypocrisy on show, to add to the other depicted downsides.Certainly, the first few semi-comedic scenes of the film are intended to show us how completely alienated the Hanks character Alan may be feeling in this new world. But helping him bridge the gap is driver and guide Yousef - a pleasantly dodgy character who offers a sympathetic highlight of the film ... but is in fact played by New York-born Alexander Black!Now that is another somewhat weird circumstance.And yet all this is the strange new world the Hanks character ultimately chooses to live and work in, having fallen in love with a lady doctor who treats his afflictions physical and mental. (And since said doctor is played by London-born Sarita Choudhury, who is half-Indian, we are again being presented with something that is not quite what it is making out to be).Now does the whole possibly hang together as a story? Not really, for how could it?And naturally, some of this is down to Dave Eggers, who wrote the original novel (as he also wrote the in-some-ways-very-innovative ""The Circle"", whose screen version also features Hanks).However, a certain amount of pleasure (and cross-cultural enlightenment) is to be had as we follow Alan through the aforesaid, pretty unlikely transition, hence I'm risking a 7 for an effort that is fairly unique (though ever-so-slightly recalling the (better?) 2011 film-of-the-book ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"")."

",0.4215,0.9909,2017-09-17 00:00:00,7,"I really liked this movie, but I understand it is culturally distasteful and Hollywood's way of mocking the Saudi Arabian culture. Your common sense tells you there would be not bikinis in a store's window display. No Saudi Arabian woman, married or otherwise,would go snorkeling topless when the risks of getting caught is death. So even though the SA doctor and Tom Hanks have chemistry and a cute romance, it's completely implausible. As far as the Embassy party scene, the illegal booze, drug use, and business professional hooking up in private, that happens behind closed doors yet it was insulting to Muslims for them to include it even though I thought the scenes were interesting. Yet, I enjoyed this movie and seeing middle aged love besides a sixty year old man hooking up with a bubbly twenty something. Hank's character struggle is realistic like many Americans are facing now trying to keep their head above water drowning in debt,dwindling job opportunities, stagnant pay, lack of job security, outsourcing, and constant of uncertainty. His character was very relatable struggling with the disappointments in his life and trying to continue to feel alive in an ever changing world. I loved the scenery of Saudi Arabia, the exotic deserts, the beautiful women even covered up in their hijabs, the beautiful white sand beaches, large spacious homes, it's like their living like kings in the desert. It was a beauty movie to watch with exotic locations and one of my favorite scenes is when he meets the SA businessman giving him a taste of the SA wealth. No it's completely accurate and devout Muslims will find this movie insulting because of the vices shown. Yet, I enjoy this fantasy of a movie mixed with reality of living in a global unpredictable world."
" Astonished - Wondered - Dishearted
",0.3818,-0.8159,2017-08-01 00:00:00,5,"To summarize things, I am a huge Tom Hanks fan. I love to see his movies over and over. The Terminal (2004) - I don't know how many times I have seen that movie and even cried. But this particular movie also made me cry, because of the intense level of pain. Totally unexpected from Tom Hanks, that he will go through with such a character and a script. I have tried to watch this movie and for the first several attempts, I failed. The movie has no attraction points. There is almost no scene where you can get amazed and set yourself for the rest of the movie. Everything is so hazy and without any solid purpose.I will still be seeing more of Tom Hank's movies. But I don't expect him to work on such type of characters."
" Almost completely unbelievable but entertaining if you can ignore the many faults
",-0.4112,-0.9852,2017-07-31 00:00:00,7,"One of the measures I apply to a movie is whether I can ever imagine myself wanting to watch it again. If so, it rates 7 (or more depending on how good it was the first time). If I can't see myself wanting to watch a movie again, it rates variously below 7 down to sub 6 which means it's to be avoided. It's simple but it works for me.I gave this one 7.3 on that basis despite its many, many faults and its almost total incredibility. I'm sure alcohol can be obtained in Saudi Arabia despite its being illegal in just the same way prostitution is everywhere in Thailand where I live despite its also being illegal here.But, here's the thing as some other people have observed about this movie. A relationship such as that which the female doctor, Dr Harem?, allowed to develop between herself and Tom Hanks' character is quite incredible in the society of Saudi Arabia. She would never in a million years have placed either herself or Alan Clay in that potentially lethal situation. She would face the very real risk of being beheaded or stoned to death and he might have faced the same fate as as accessory in what the Saudis would no doubt see as HER crime. And please, don't let anyone tell you that women have any freedom whatever in countries such as Saudi Arabia; every aspect of their lives is controlled by their husbands and other male relatives and any transgression of that tight control could well see them stoned, and not in the nice Western way of getting stoned. Swimming topless in daylight with any man, even with her husband in Saudi Arabia. I don't bloody think so unless she had a death wish. Even being alone with a man who's not her husband would probably lead to life threatening consequences.I have to wonder what was the purpose of portraying life in Saudi as anything other than the repressive Hell that it no doubt is for people who happen to be female.Look, it's not a great movie but if you can at least try to ignore the facts of life for women in Saudi, then it's not too bad and might prompt me to watch it again some time. All the same, I can't see that happening any time soon."

Desperate, defeated Tom Hanks struggles to win his successful life back in Saudi Arabia. And that's where the interesting part starts. Although most scenes were filmed in Morocco, it gives the viewer a good perspective of life in this ultra conservative country for expats (and for wealthy locals). The desert, the marketing, the secret parties, the camouflaged alcohol, the foreign workers.. I don't see why most people disliked it, but I would happily watch it again."
" one where you wonder why it was made
",0.0,0.7514,2017-06-19 00:00:00,6,"The name Tom Hanks is synonymous with big budget non-CGI films with good acting. ""A Hologram for the King"" from 2016 stars Hanks, has some beautiful scenery, but really no point that I could see. It was based on a successful novel, and I suppose someone thought it would make a good movie.Hanks is divorced businessman Alan Clay, who goes to Saudi Arabia to seal a deal - the company he works for wants to sell a holographic teleconferencing system for a new city being built in the desert, and he is to give a demonstration to the King. He's in a financial crunch; his daughter hasn't been able to attend college, though she doesn't mind delaying it.When he arrives in Saudi Arabia, he runs into delays - the King isn't in town, and no one knows when he's supposed to show up. Clay's team is housed in a tent with poor wi-fi and has to bring food from the hotel. He can't get any answers from anybody about anything.During the time he is there, he connects with his driver Yousef (Alexander Black) and also meets a female doctor (Sarita Choudhury), who treats a large cyst in his back.The rest of the time he drinks like a fish, almost becomes involved with a Danish contractor named Hanne (Sidse Babett Knudsen), and goes on a hunt for wolves disturbing a flock of sheep with Yousef. Finally, he does meet with his point person there, and his team has food, air conditioning, and wi-fi. But there is so little time spent on the reason he's there in the film, it doesn't matter to the viewer.I guess this was supposed to be a story of Americans doing business or being in another culture, but this culture isn't even correctly represented. His involvement with a married female doctor is impossible, as is her presence alone with him in his hotel room.The story has some holes, including that the Hanks character is staying in Jeddah, but is told that the person he wants to see isn't in town -he's in Jeddah. Hello? This is a script that forgot what it was about, whatever it was about. For some reason the book was well-received. Didn't make a good film, even if it did star Tom Hanks."
" Worst Tom Hanks Movie Ever

The plot is boring beyond belief. If this movie has any purpose at all, it is merely to show how stupid westerners can be when traveling to vastly different cultures. It's hard to feel sorry for Americans who get captured while hiking in Iran because they thought it would be cool, or an American dimwit student who steals a poster in North Korea and gets sentenced to 15 years at hard labor. Similarly, it was hard for me to feel sorry for Hanks' character, who must have experienced 20 such moments in this film. Other than these lessons, I don't think the film had any redeeming qualities, and it certainly was not funny at all."

He outsourced production of Schwinn, an American icon, to China and the company went under when the Chinese undercut Schwinn. Clay bitterly describes the result ""all the bikes are the same, just different labels for different companies"" and the Chinese of course can sell theirs for a fraction of what Schwinn does.Now he finds himself on a ""do or die"" mission for his current company. His job is to sell a holographic communications package to the Royal Family in Saudi Arabia.He has to negotiate a number of obstacles, both real and imaginary, to achieve his goal. There is a literal ""monkey on his back"" that represents his state in life. Once he gets rid of that the life he imagined comes back...or does it? Karma both gives and takes.Tighter editing would have made this a much better picture. Perhaps some voice-over dialogue from Clay to emphasize the Willy Loman in him.

" A Wavering, Temporary Perspective of Life and Love in the Middle East
",0.5574,0.9261,2017-05-07 00:00:00,6,"Tom Hanks plays a fish-out-of-water businessman in this tale of culture shock, self- doubt and discovery. Set amidst the flat desert plains of Saudi Arabia, Hanks aims to mend his financial struggles by selling an absentee king on a gimmicky hologram- driven teleconferencing solution. Along the way, he encounters no shortage of roadblocks, be they personal, bureaucratic, cultural or medical, and eventually recognizes it as a growth opportunity. This is a conflicted picture, much in the same way our leading man plays a conflicted individual. Nailing down a steady tone seems difficult; the film opens with a loose, cartoonish musical number, then settles into a fast-paced corporate shuffle before cutting that loose and becoming a warm-hearted buddy picture and, finally, a contemplative romance. All this in a very trim, quick ninety minutes. Social norms are a steady focus, shining a flashlight on the immense gap between everyday life as an American and as a Saudi, but in the end it feels like those are only superficial, easily brushed aside to make way for a happy ending. That climax leaves us with dozens of loose ends, half-heartedly explored threads that are inspected and discarded like an inattentive child digging through his toybox. It all feels very loose and light, like we've read a summary but not the entire story. There's a compelling yarn buried somewhere within A Hologram for the King, but we only skim the surface. Interesting and original but quite limited."

It's hard to say, as based on the finished product this adaptation of Dave Egger's novel is a curiously misguided affair that squanders its chances to be a cultural crossing feel good event.Tykwer who burst onto the scene with his frenetic Run Lola Run and delivered some unique offerings with the likes of Perfume: The Story of a Murderer and his tales in the box office flop Cloud Atlas, seems to be trying to reign it in here with Hologram barely allowing the director to escape the bonds of its out of place American stuck in a foreign land trying to get by and fix his slowly disintegrating life and the director seems unsuited to making the most of this potentially great story.We get brief glimpses of Tykwer bringing something new and inventive to the table, an initial moment as the film begins seems to be suggesting some surreal imagery is coming our way while some of the films locations are captured in some eye opening ways, but for a majority of the films fairly brief runtime, the audience will be just as bored as Tom Hanks's Alan Clay and his I.T crew.Making his mark in 2016 with the memorable Sully, its lucky Tom Hanks had Clint Eastwood's film behind him as Hologram marks down another so-so performance from everyman actor that has seen the beloved performer deliver disappointing turns over the last decade.Alan on paper seems like a great fit for Hanks to inhabit but his not a particularly likable presence and when the most pressing thing in his life is dealing with a growth on his back, Alan doesn't exactly call for audience engagement and for a film that seems to be going for oddball comedic moments, Hologram is light on laughs to go along with its narrative mundanity.Not memorable in the slightest and wasting its talented lead, A Hologram for the King is a deserved box-office flop that was always an odd choice for director Tykwer, who can do and should do a lot better than this middling effort, that often seems content with remaining in first gear.1 ½ weak Wi-Fi signals out of 5"

The characters he meets Yousef, his driver and Zahara, his doctor and later on friend and confidant are fantastically cast by Alexander Black and Sarita Choudhury.

He also meets a few other interesting characters, who show him how to appreciate the place, even if it so different than back home.So you could see this as a timely metaphor about the US and the Middle East finally reconciling despite their differences. It's a call to Americans to open up their spirits and not get bogged down in parochialism and narrow thinking. Learn about the Middle East. Appreciate it.It's also about finding love later in life, and the healing power of love. I see the movie as shooting an arrow into the hearts of 60ers everywhere: Your life is not over yet.
