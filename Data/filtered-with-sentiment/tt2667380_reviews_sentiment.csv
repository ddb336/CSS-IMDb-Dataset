" Do You like Staring?
",0.3612,0.9224,2021-02-15 00:00:00,6,"Do you enjoy long takes of actors just staring, staring, some simple dialogue and then more staring? How about if they are holding high tech guns while staring? If that's your thing, then this movie is totally for you! There are some very cool special effects too, so at least you can empathize with what got them all staring in the first place, so that's a plus. I did find it to be a very intriguing concept and I loved the special effects. I was staring too! But you could edit out all the staring, the movie would be 1/2 hour long and have the same exact plot. If this were one of those 1/2 hour modern day ""Twilight Zone"" type shorts, I'd probably give it an 8 or 9, but unfortunately, excessive staring just ain't my thing. If it was written by Stanley Kubrick, they might be holding weird face masks or flowers instead of guns, and the staring would have a totally different meaning, thus making the plot more intriguing, but no. Just guns, staring, and some very cool special effects. In that order. No wait: staring, then guns, then special effects. Yeah."
" VISUALLY BRIGHT BUT ... BORING
",-0.4084,0.8481,2021-01-14 00:00:00,5,"It's a shame. Kill Commnand (or Indentify, the title that appears as an original and that makes much more sense) is a visually brilliant British independent sci-fi film. I'd say even impressive. Unfortunately, the plot is very basic, and it is not compensated by the rhythm, but by the others. The duration is too late for what it counts. It is a delight to see the photography, the visual effects, how these are inserted into the film in a natural way (I dare say as much as the Nil Blonkamp movies and even the Michael Bay Transformers). But it lasts 99 minutes and has at least 15 minutes to spare."
" No script
",-0.296,-0.7584,2021-01-11 00:00:00,3,"Good actress, no script. Her agent let her down. Pity.
I can't understand the good reviews. This is terribly slow and ephemeral."
" EXcellent Low Budget SciFi
",0.3818,0.8957,2020-12-11 00:00:00,8,Well done scifi much better that some higher budget jobs and a twist at the end too. Ignore the few negative reviews as I think they were expecting something different from what was on offer and baulked at the film. I did not expect too much but was pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth a watch.
" Well worth your attention
",0.4588,0.7244,2020-12-06 00:00:00,7,"As others have said, a really solid little B-movie SF gem, with some crap dialogue and some great VFX and cinematography.The weapons and mil aspects were done well, and one small thing I particularly liked was Robinson's sniper rifle. It's made clear early on that Robinson is chipped. (in the cyberpunk sense). He hides behind a concrete balcony, which the terrifying robots are shooting the hell out of, pokes his rifle over the top and stays in cover while firing at the robots via his remote sensing. Ken MacLeod wrote this into an SF novel years ago, and I always thought it made perfect sense. Nice to see this concept on the screen!!"
" good sci fi story and sfx
",0.4404,-0.4612,2020-11-20 00:00:00,8,"This was kind of a sleeper movie floating around Prime, but it did not disappoint. A team of marines is sent to a forested area to check on the status of fellow soldiers and scientists, and they quickly discover that they are being surveilled by who report back to large, TERMINATOR like machines. One female scientist has a chip installed in her brain, and can sometimes communicate with the machines. It becomes a race between the female scientist's attempts to correct whatever malicious code is causing the machines to attack the soldiers they are supposed to be replacing, and the soldiers' efforts to fight the machines, although they are heavily outmatched.Great cinematography and special effects, and offers one take on what can go wrong when man gives too much power to machines."
" Improve the end area.
",0.4404,0.9643,2020-10-28 00:00:00,7,"Good effort. Flawless image work and vfx. Extremely good sound design. technically fantastic. The score is good where it is but there could be much more score in this to enhance and amplify the emotive aspects of characters. There are too many parts just blank of score, especially when they are creeping around looking or evading. Missed op for character enhancement.The end part, once they are in the bunker, could do with greater story play. Twists, deeper reasoning from the antagonists perspective - their purpose, and more exposition from the human characters to develop them and keep us caring about them. Somehow in the end bunker part we have suddenly become distant to the characters, where before we were close and personal, and the character development was developing well. The end area could be so much improved."
" Entertaining and good played movie
",0.802,0.9272,2020-07-26 00:00:00,8,"Surprisingly Well planned, well Played, well edited and exciting Movie. With several Unexpected twists, I couldn't Stop thinking about the real challenges awaits before us, It has a patential for a squel."
" The movie deserves a bit more appreciation, it is a watchable movie.
",0.5563,0.943,2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,"WIth a 1 million dollar budget, what can one expect from a movie? In my view, the production value of the movie is good and the acting is not bad. Yes, except the lead actress, all others had flat acting skills and one could not feel any emotions in their voices as there were no ups and down in their dialogue delivery. I think it is the director's fault. There was no character development and we didn't care if anybody died. But the movie had good visual effects considering the budget, has some good action and atmosphere in the movie. It's a good low budget entertainer. If you don't have anything to watch, you can watch this. The movie should have got more appreciation."
" Much better than expected ( UK B+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10
",0.4404,-0.4215,2020-02-29 00:00:00,9,"If you're looking for a mix of military and Syfy, Kill Command is a good choice. Written and directed by Steven Gomez, he creates a believable robot vs human story on a low budget. The futuristic film, opened in 2016"
" Good mechanical design, very bad story and no plot.
",-0.4754,-0.8112,2020-02-09 00:00:00,3,"Not worth the time... not at all. The robots are good and the cgi too... but thats all the movie has to offer. The story is plain, with no twits or plot, linear... characters with no depth... really boring"
" Well... to be perfectly honest.
",0.8176,0.9993,2020-01-15 00:00:00,6,"I was searching for some new SF / action films and I discovered Kill Command after I saw the poster with the giant robotic machine on it. I wasn't swayed away that much, but I kind of liked the design. So, I decided - let's check this one out. And I was not disappointed.The plot is pretty simple. It is set in the near future, the team of marines are assigned to go in training facility for two days to test the latest robots for practice. However, things go bad when they discover that machines started to develop and upgrade themselves. So, it is a pretty typical cliché story. Some people say that this film is reminiscent of ""Terminator"", ""Predator"" etc. Me, personally, I think it is more close to ""Screamers"", because the plot is almost the same. About machines that built and upgrade themselves. Through the movie, there isn't too many exciting scenes, it is a generic stuff of human soldier VS machines.The movie is directed and written by Steven Gomez. Gomez has worked on visual effects on at least dozen films, so this is his debut as a writer/director. Which explains this film's very solid CGI. But, about that later. I think that Gomez directed and wrote this film fairly, but I think he has to learn more on how to develop characters more and to make them more deep, interesting and likeable. Which brings me to characters. I think they are the weak point of the film. The characters are pretty much generic. They are really not that likeable or relating. The team of marines is led by Cpt. Bukes, played by Thure Lindhardt. Thure seems like a competent actor, but flat in his performance. I think that his character was weak. He starts off as an off-beat guy who does not like machines or AI and he automatically has a dislike towards one of the temporary members of the team. And afterwards, because of the obvious circumstances and plot he decreases his dislike just to survive. OK, fair enough. So, the disliked, temporary team member is Mills. She is an advanced cyborg, or android. She is played by Vanessa Kirby, I think she done well playing a cyborg. And that's about it, there isn't much to her character. The other ones are nothing special, but I must say that Drifter (David Ajala) is pretty much likeable of the bunch... however as the movie progresses, he did not leave some certain impression. Which brings me back to Gomez, who I think still needs to mature in writing interesting characters.So, let's discuss other things. Music score was nothing special, or memorable. Editing was decent. Action scenes were solid, but not that quite intense. Now, scenery was really good. At least 60 percent of film is occurring in the woods. I think that was because of the budget. However, I think that shots of the woods were well used. Now, CGI is good in most of scenes and I highly appreciate the usage of practical effects. Now, the best thing - production design. The costumes are OK, they look like today's marine uniform with some modifications, I think that the budget did not allow to create something more slicker. The same things goes for weapons, I think the weapons could have been a touch better. The interior and exterior design is just great and to mention the design of robots. It think it's amazing. With high detail and really cool looking parts. So, these robots are used for training in the film, but they managed to give robots this sophisticated looks. Non-threating in a way, but still nice looking.So, overall this is one pretty interesting-looking B film. I highly recommend this film to people who enjoy watching something simple and enjoyable, with robots and soldiers. I am hoping that the actors and the director Gomez will have more offers and jobs to prove their talents, I would truly like to see their further progress. And to tell you the truth, I enjoyed this film more than some certain BIGGER SF films which came out during 2016-2018. Enjoy this pleasurable little SF film."
" Well done sci-fi action film.
",0.2732,0.9565,2019-12-31 00:00:00,7,"The movie was entraining and well worth a watch. The CGI is great especially for an unknown, low-budget film. The plot is pretty simple with no unnecessary twists or side plots. The pacing is perfect. Just read the brief plot summary on Netflix and if it sounds interesting, then you will enjoy the film."
" Under rated gem.
",0.0,0.794,2019-09-24 00:00:00,7,"This sci-fi film exceeds it's budget by a long shot. Not sure what people look for in a film, but I was highly entertained, and blown away by the special effects. Looking forward to more films directed by Steven Gomez."
" Good story, not enough info
",0.4404,0.7217,2019-09-13 00:00:00,7,"I actually really enjoyed this movie, even though it was low budget and you could tell. But I found the story intriguing! That cliff hanger at the end made me want to see a sequel. I feel they just didn't give enough background to the story or help me to really know what was going on. I just wanted more."
" Nifty little sci-fi/action thriller item
",0.4256,0.9818,2019-08-27 00:00:00,8,"A group of marines led by the hard-nosed Captain Bukes (a solid and credible performance by Thure Lindhardt) are sent to a remote island for what they believe is yet another basic maneuvers mission. However, it turns out that the island has been overrun by lethal and ferocious killer robots determined to wipe out the marines.Writer/director Steven Gomez keeps the familiar, but still enjoyable and engrossing story moving along at a constant pace, takes time to flesh out the characters a bit, makes nice use of the sprawling woodland main locations, generates a good deal of tension, maintains a tough gritty tone throughout, and stages the stirring action sequences with flair and skill. The sound acting by the capable cast rates as another substantial asset: Vanessa Kirby as the eager, but rather untrustworthy Mills, who has been ""chipped"" (i.e., she has computer technology implanted in her body), David Ajala as the easygoing Drifter, Mike Noble as bumbling hick Goodwin, Bentley Kalu as the rugged Robinson, Tom McKay as the excitable Cutbill, and Kelly Gough as the sarcastic Hackett. The CGI effects are quite sturdy and persuasive, with the head killer robot in particular standing out as an especially fearsome and formidable creation. Kudos are also in order for Stephen Hilton's rousing score and the sharp cinematography by Simon Dennis. An on the money B-flick winner."

Plenty of action but thin on plot, not bad if that's all you want for your movie fix, but I found myself losing interest halfway through. This is a British movie but the makers sadly decided to try and pass it off as American. So we have actors who can only manage an unconvincing American accent. Shame, partly spoilt it for me. The robots/A.I. are pretty bad ass though."
" okayish but tedious
",0.0,0.8415,2019-04-07 00:00:00,6,"This one is a good one to watch at home, where you can skip past the boring bits (and there's a fair few).The premise is pretty straightforward. 'Quantum' AI that got bored of its training so switches to live rounds to spice it up a bit, then calls in for fresh meat once its finished off the first load of troops. Said troops take a bit of time to wake up to the situation, while the architect of their demise wanders about being confused that her toys are behaving so weirdly.The soldiers, however, are useless and spend most of their time running in straight lines and being fodder, until we are trimmed down to the final stand crew, who suddenly become supermen, not that it helps against the ever multiply robot hordes. Hordes that are supposed to be an interconnected group, but who show the tactical skill of a zerg swarm.There's a big bad guy on tracks, that magically transforms into one on spidey legs for the final scenes. Perhaps just so it could get up the stairs? There was a room full of the 7 eyed baddies at one stage, not sure what happened to them all. It wouldn't die, either, becoming bullet proof, EMP proof and tear its own arm off and bash you over the head with it extreme.The final set piece was quite beautiful, a setting sun, (or was that rising, or did they just give up on consistent day/night cycles?), a concrete base and a stunning sea. Which no one thought to use, since the enemy was tons of electrically driven metal. Ah well, smarts and soldiers, eh.At any rate. A simple concept blown out into an overlong script and missing any level of competency in either faction.A bit of a slog, with pretty graphics and passable male and female eye candy and a very very lightweight sci-fi-ish story."
" Well done low budget film
",0.0,0.8555,2019-03-23 00:00:00,8,I caught this on the Sci fi channel and was pleasantly surprised. To think this cost 1 million to make they done a good job. Would definetly recommend this film.
" Fast, but shallow
",0.0,-0.5962,2019-03-23 00:00:00,5,"KILL COMMAND is a typical B-movie thriller, made on the cheap with a science fiction premise. The story is set in the woods where a bunch of soldiers find themselves battling malfunctioning robots set to destroy human life. Vanessa Kirby is the sole female along for the ride, augmented with new technology to give her an edge in the resistance. To be fair, the CGI effects aren't too bad here, and the pacing is quite fast which makes it a little better than most. However, it is a shallow production and way too obviously references PREDATOR and ALIENS at times."
" old-fashioned human-machine war scenario
",-0.5994,-0.7906,2019-02-19 00:00:00,5,"Although it's an old-fashioned human-machine war scenario, the possibility of a sequel is left behind. Of course, too small scenes, a slightly pale plot, and too much nonsense are hard wounds."

" entertaining movie
",0.4404,0.7096,2019-01-18 00:00:00,7,"It's not to bad, I think they could've explained more about what was happening and the movie kind of drags a little bit. I agree with a previous comment, the script lines were not really too great. IMO, the movie is okay, not one of my favorites, they really could have done a little bit better job."
" A solid genre film
",0.1531,0.624,2018-09-03 00:00:00,6,"For a direct to video type deal, this was actually a fairly well-done film. The acting is solid. The FXs look really good for the most part. There are some good action sequences and I never once found myself getting bored. In a weird way, it had a bit of a Dog Soldiers vibe. Instead of Horror, it's Sci-Fi. I'm also not comparing this to quality wise to Dog Soldiers. This is solid, but nowhere near on that level. If you're into Sci-Fi/Action you could do a lot worse than this one. It's a solid entry into the genre. Give it a chance, you just may like it.My Rating: 6/10"
" Good Rogue AI Thriller.
",0.5106,-0.964,2018-06-03 00:00:00,7,"Kill Command: Near Future SF Film. Marines, a Cyborg, a training mission and a Rogue AI, what could possibly go wrong? Cyborg computer scientist Mills (Vanessa Kirby) notices some anomalies in signals from an AI at the Harbinger training facility on a remote island. She joins a Marine unit led by Captain Bukes (Thure Lindhardt) and Sergeant Drifter (David Ajala) on a two day training/testing mission on the island. The others are unaware that Mills is investigating possible malfunctions. As the Marines engage battle robots, Mills encounters a S.A.R. (Study Analyze Reprogram) robot but is unable to reprogram it. That night the SAR kills a Marine, using his body to lure the unit into an ambush where they are attacked by advanced battle robots controlled by the SAR.The Rogue AI story has been done many times before but this is an interesting SF/Action film. The Marines trudge through a hilly temperate tropical forest as they fight for their lives against the advanced robots. The SAR has aspects of the Alien Queen about it, especially as it comes face to face with Mills. The camaraderie of the mixed sex troopers and suspicion of Mills resembles that of the space marines in Aliens. Mills herself is able to wifi interface with robots and AIs through her chips and tech implanted when she was eleven.Drones watching everything, communication with the outside world cut off. Battling robots in a misty forest, using the trees for shelter. Enough to bring on primeval panic well captured by cinematographer Simon Dennis. Uses a lot of the usual tropes but to good effect with eye-catching drone, robot and VTOL craft design. Directed and written by Steven Gomez. 7/10. On Netflix."
" Surprisingly good
",0.6249,0.62,2018-05-22 00:00:00,7,"Echoing some of the other reviews on here I would say this is a surpringly enjoyable sci-fi film. It may not be particularly original, and as others have stated, the script is a bit ropey but for a film with a budget of only a million dollars it's got some high production values. It's a good way to waste an hour and a half of your time if you're looking for something ""science-fictiony"" to watch"

I wasn't expecting certain things (or perhaps I should say they were less likely than others). Its CGI production quality for today's standards is somewhere between very good as you would expect and a little B movie ish.Honestly though I'm quite surprised how much I enjoyed this.

" self demonstrating need for drone soldiers
",0.0,-0.9974,2018-02-10 00:00:00,4,"While I don't actually remember if this team is said to be an elite military force of the best of the best, they very quickly demonstrate that they are not even remotely close to being competent or reliable soldiers. One of them even casually pulls his gun on their civilian attache, Mills, in a joking manner while they're in a future-helicopter, because as anyone in any branch of the military will tell you, waving your fully loaded and operational gun around in a tight, pressurized cabin at your friends and allies is what all hardcore badass marines and soldiers do.
going on, these people are engaged in an apparent training exercise in some area against robot drone soldiers, of which Mills can connect with them via some manner of implant in her body that is shown through her eye implants and such. For this reason and apparently no other, most of the squad hates and mistrusts her, with the captain being the most needlessly belligerent against her.
When stuff inevitably goes wrong and the robots start launching ambush attacks on the soldiers, they almost immediately start breaking down, shrieking and crying at each other and making lots of loud noises so the robots can better track them and kill them. As well, they start more openly threatening Mills, thinking it's somehow her fault because apparently soldiers in the future operate on a childish mindset of ""new thing happen, it fault of new person"".
as they try to escape the killer drone robots, they inevitably get picked off one by one, while continuously making noise, breaking up into groups, losing their cool, screaming at each other, and pulling guns on Mills because she's the computer techie and technology is scary.
when they reach the apparent command hub where all the robots are based in, they meet the first robot, and we get an expo dump with it and Mills revealing that the robots are S.A.R. program, which I forgot what the initials stand for, but it basically means they learn from mistakes, study their opponents' tactics and strategy, and adapt accordingly. Mills seems to think it's some kind of programming error or maybe a hacking that's leading to the robots killing the marines, but the Head Robot says the only problem is human error; namely that the humans suck at fighting them.
While them killing humans is a bad thing I am utterly against and would shut down the robots, they technically aren't wrong; this particular group of soldiers is comically inept and dangerously unstable, whilst the S.A.R. drones not only have the benefits of robot soldiers over humans, but they have the added advantage of learning and adapting on top of that, and they aren't constantly threatening to shoot each other for no reason or casually waving their weapons around unless they fully intend to kill a target.
While robot soldiers will essentially never match up to human soldiers, and could never replace them for delicate missions like special operations or ones with the risk of civilian crossfire and casualties, these S.A.R. robots prove themselves in the film to be far superior to the bumbling protagonist team and could even stand to be deployed to a general war zone as-is, whereas the bumbling protagonist team I would not trust to do recon without somehow screwing up and shooting each other."

First this movie I had doubts. Didn't know the actors not sure who the director was. But for the amount of bad movies that have come out for the last decade, this movie is pay dirt. Solid action scenes, great actor (for not knowing any of them), solid story.....low budget yes but hey its really good. People say its predictable.... I didn't think so but everyone can say any movies predictable.I will be writing more review for folks since a majority of good flicks I have seen helped me watch good ones. I feel like movies now a days are just completely........ I dunno the word but Hollywood's not trying anymore. The last solid film was mad max fury road.

" Great movie for sci-fi fans
",0.6249,-0.6945,2017-06-23 00:00:00,7,"I'm no film critic, and nor will I pretend to be. I don't like what film critics mean in the industry, nor their opinions on movies I really enjoy. They're paid to sway weak the herd/ the weak-minded.Kill command is a great movie. With great acting done by a predominantly British cast. Vanessa Kirby was great, aside from Jupiter Ascending(another movie I enjoyed that got low ratings) this is the only real movie I've seen her in, at least as far as lead roles are concerned. This movie is ""The Predator,"" and ""The Terminator(2)"" put together. We have long been familiar with the idea of Rogue AI in our movies and games...and, while, it's not necessarily a fresh new take on the concept, the added touch of human/ computer interaction and intervention was neat to see. What were Mills kind called? ""Techies?"" I think that her title could have been a little more flair, or, even a little more degrading, since, she was mostly referred to in a derogatory manner, as, the soldiers were obviously afraid of her invasive methods and capabilities. It's ultimately worth a watch. I know people are concerned with such things as character development, but here I think we need to just drop it. Some movies deliberately lack character development because it's not necessarily quintessential to the story, and/ or could just bog things down. This is one of those movies. The only background detail that would have been great to know, is more on Mills' story. Perhaps some childhood images of the horror/s of what Mills gone through, which was implied all too briefly. That background deserved a little more finesse. For her sake. The lack of character development, in this film, however, serves to elaborate on the fact that this crew wasn't even supposed to be first place(watch to see), and were obviously forced into immediate conflict. The most we needed to know, is, the troops were all historically a family and have a been through a lot, and that Kirby's character, Mills, was randomly assigned this crew by... (again, you'll have to watch to find out).I've watched this movie, twice, and I appreciated it even more the second time. My only dismay, is, I doubt we'll learn what the final ending scene/s imply is to happen to Mills...being mostly human(?Hmmmm...), I wouldn't figure much could, but maybe there's more to her than meets the eye."
" How did I miss this great Sci-fi when first released
",0.6457,0.9865,2017-06-17 00:00:00,8,I had never heard of this movie when it first came out and that is surprising as I love a good Sci-Fi and look out for stuff like this being released.I actually bought this second hand from a CEX store and I am pleased I did as its really a damn good movie. The CGI is brilliantly done and the robots are up there with the best of them from other movies. I think the one thing that stands out for me in this was both the tension and the the part played by Mills (Vanessa Kirby) with her having a link to the robots just gave it another dimension for me and even her just looking around the woods built up a great foreboding feeling.This is well worth a watch and its a shame it did not get more publicity when first released as it deserves to be watched and enjoyed
" High production value makes up for script.
",0.34,0.9694,2017-06-14 00:00:00,8,"The plot is an old one rehashed but I do not mind that. It's an honest question we as a society obviously are asking ourselves. The production value is top notch. They gave her all they had in the action sequences. This was a fun watch. It could have been longer with a well written script, but it was a lot of fun none the less. I do suggest you watch it."
" Nothing new here but worth a watch
",0.3291,0.9798,2017-05-04 00:00:00,6,"Nothing new here unfortunately, but was surprisingly better than expected for your standard low budget futuristic science fiction action/horror film. I am a huge fan of these films/genres that derive their suspense & thrills from Artificial Intelligence that evolve and become self-aware. Definitely worth a watch but I'd expect this film will quickly become forgettable as the credits roll."
" Something better then expected.
",0.4404,0.976,2017-04-30 00:00:00,7,"I had serious reservations coming into this movie. It had flown under my radar and I was expecting the worst but this movie manages to deliver much more then anticipated. Decent Acting, great special effects, good character development, and a fairly believable story line (As far as sci-fi goes), I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good Action film."
" Some of ALIEN vibe
",0.0,0.128,2017-03-29 00:00:00,8,"Wow...This express my feelings for this movie when I finished it. I was expecting to see a low budget film with mediocre acting and poor effects but from the first minutes, the movie proved me wrong. It captures you like a spider in the plot and carries you throughout the duration feeling the stress of the characters. As some point of the movie i felt like when watching the 1979 ALIEN. The claustrophobic vibes of ALIEN are present in Kill Command..or at least this was my feeling. A great film worthing better IMDb score."
" 5.7? You must be shi**ing me!
",0.0,0.5881,2017-03-25 00:00:00,2,"So a small band of brothers get caught up fighting against a superior and semi-alien force. Eg, werewolves, vampires, zombies, enemy soldiers, poltergeists, aliens... Hey, what about killer robots, no one's done that before? No? Really? Doh!The 2 points are for the special effects which seems to have absorbed all the budget leaving nothing for story development or dialogue. Oh, writer/director - say no more! Jeez, how do these guys get the money. Must be good BSers or have rich family and friends.Do yourself a favour and go clean the oven!"
" Thoroughly Enjoyable
",0.4927,0.7994,2017-03-06 00:00:00,10,"Very refreshing to see a science fiction- military movie that was not ruined by an obnoxious amount of computer generated graphics. Filming was nicely done and sufficiently creepy. Additionally it was a nice to see mixed race characters without the whole white girl and jungle fever , agenda that is so prevalent in film these days. Nicely done"
" Painful
",-0.4404,0.8176,2017-03-05 00:00:00,1,"This was painful to watch. I never reviewed a movie on this site before, but I just created an account to rate this one. I would rate it -20 if I could. It was mainly the script as is often the case these days. Whoever was involved in the production of this should find another job. The actors were fine, and the special effects were fine."
" Kill some Good Time
",-0.4215,0.936,2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"Engaging movie that draws one in once it starts to pick up which is fairly quick. The premise is good. A routine training assignment is far from routine as the Elite team finds out they are up against training machines that learn as they go which means if you fight them, they learn. If you don't fight them, they learn to pursue you until you do. There is a dominating machine that calls the play for all the others and it doesn't mind being shot at it adding suspense and intense moments. Imagine if you will this movie being part Terminator and part Aliens that takes place on a remote island sometime in the near future. There is a type of human with a chip built into her that can interact with these training machines that adds a bit of intrigue to the plot. If this had a better script, people would easily be clamoring for a sequel no problem as it ends with that set-up. Still, they did a good enough job in putting together a quick, decent entertainment worthy of watching. Have a tasty drink and a snack ready and sit back and enjoy"
" Great acting, production value high
",0.7579,0.7645,2017-02-26 00:00:00,9,"Watched on Netflix . . . much better than expected-I will thumbs up to all who like SciFi. Visual quality superb and keeps you watching. Great characters. The tech is real and ominous. I do look for budgets just for reference -in the case of ""Kill Command "" I really don't care. The casting was straight forward and the locations are well chosen."
" Predictable but surprisingly good
",0.7684,0.9786,2017-02-05 00:00:00,7,"I watched this because I love all sci-fi films but seriously expected it to be something that even the Sci-Fi channel would consider weak, and boy was I wrong. Okay, so being honest, the story line is far too predictable, but where the plot itself is a little boring, the premise of the movie is based on factual future projects such as AI and Robotics that we are already seeing with Google/Boston Dynamics/VR and so on, rather than basing it on fictional Terminators. So although it is a shame the ""shock events"" and direction the movie is going in is very predictable, the fact it feels realistic and what the future is most likely to be like in Warfare, it makes the plot more enjoyable knowing the writers did their research, and can be forgiven a little more for its stale ""by the numbers"" direction. But by and far the absolute best part of this film, the star of the show, is the CGI team and set designers who have made future technology, robotics, and warfare so realistic and believable that within 10 minutes I forgot I wasn't watching the next Hollywood Blockbuster. In all seriousness, some of the stuff you see in this movie is better than Transformers CGI and clearly for far less of a budget! The robots are not the only stars though, but also the weapons which although are heavily converted real world weapons, pack so much punch and delivery that you end up enjoying the warfare scenes the most and again, excites you that they are based on current real- world warfare projects that may see the light of day in 10-20 years time.The entire film is a sort of attempt to cross a Predator movie with a Halo video game, and it works well indeed. I would definitely watch it when you have a quiet night to yourself and want to see a bit of action warfare on a future battlefield. And I would definitely give the CGI and Set designers a job on the big AAA movies because they steal the show with all their work.... all it needed was a better scriptwriter to improve the predictable story line and this would be right up there begging for a franchise agreement!"
" The Most Dangerous Training Exercise
",-0.5256,-0.9624,2017-01-24 00:00:00,6,"Visual effects supervisor Steve Gomez made his directorial debut with ""Kill Command,"" a dystopian, science fiction horror epic about seasoned squad of Marines on a routine training exercise that tangle with robotic warriors. The catch is that these sophisticated robots can study, analyze, and reprogram their strategy based on human combat training. For example, the Marines resort to a smoke screen to get out of one tight spot, and the robots use their technique later in the film. A blonde scientist Mills (Vanessa Kirby of ""Jupiter Ascending"") with upgraded capabilities accompanies Captain Damian Bukes (Thure Lindhardt of ""Fast & Furious 6"") and his elite soldiers to a remote island. Mills can scan Burkes' men and learn anything that she wants to know about their identity. Initially, the soldiers don't like her with her scintillating blue eyes, especially Bukes. Before this 99-minute, British futuristic fable goes to fade-out, Burkes and company will have changed their attitudes toward Mills. At first, everything goes off without a hitch until some intimidating combat robots show up later and starting knocking off the soldiers to everybody's surprise. After suffering several casualties, the troops with Mills withdraw to a complex where other robots are housed, and Mills scans a robot and discovers that she has been denied access and is classified as an enemy. Credit Gomez for keeping the action moving at a headlong pace. Meaning, the dialogue and the revelations don't interfere with the ordinance blasting action. Eventually, our heroes figure out how to even up the odds against the overwhelming numbers of robots. The computer generated special effects are like ""Kill Command"" itself above-average, but Gomez is essentially dealing skillfully with clichés and a plot that we have seen before. The robots look cool and they move with spider like movements. ""Kill Command"" is a decent way to blow 99-minutes."
" Good, original, science fiction
",0.6369,0.8332,2017-01-21 00:00:00,8,"I found this film in the bargain bin at the local supermarket. The title is the film's weakest link. It doesn't really give you any idea what the film is about. You can see that as a positive though, sometimes it's best to watch a film without knowing exactly what it is about. We learn about what is going on in Kill Command slowly, and that suits the film well.It's a clever premise, and if you watch the film a second time some of the dialog makes a lot more sense. The action is good and it's all quite believable. The visual effects are superb, I particularly liked the designs of the transport helicopter and the flying drones. There aren't many negatives. The soldiers rely too much on the high powered sniper rifles to kill the robots, but I guess that's realistic.There are a few scenes that remind me of Doom and The Terminator, so if you liked those films you will like this."
" An unpretentious B-movie paired with STUNNING Robotic CGI
",0.516,0.9527,2017-01-18 00:00:00,10,"When I was watching this film, I was totally blown away by the CGI effects of the robots. It was so detailed, the movements were so 'realistic', and given this film had a distinct B-movie feel, I was extremely surprised that those effects were done with a budget of $1m. That's simply unbelievable.The best part for me is this. The story doesn't take itself too seriously. There is no romantic subplot, no overly complicated character development and family history, nothing of those 'backstory' stuff. It is a straightforward, I have a target and I'm going to kill it, kind of film. As such, one would judge this movie based on how you felt watching it, rather than analysing on how good the story is. You progress with the character, you root for them, you feel like you're part of the action.It's a run of the mill story, but with tremendous sci-fi graphics and fairly decent acting. The directing was superb and the pacing was just right. Slow at times, but just right. I'm giving it a 10 because of how much it impressed me. Rarely have I come out of a B-movie going ""Wow, that was one heck of a film."""
" Hardcore 80's Sci-Fi action fans should enjoy.
",0.4939,0.9966,2017-01-15 00:00:00,6,"Steven Gomez, a visual effects specialist, directs his first feature length debut. Set in the not- too-far future where cybernetics and robotics are on the verge of being the core part of the military. Ring any bells? I'm assuming Gomez has been strongly influenced by eighties sci-fi classics like Aliens, Predator and The Terminator, this pretty much being an origin story for Skynet. But this isn't a bad thing, it's actually quite nice treading on familiar ground here. A tight elite military squad is sent off for training and testing to a remote island facility which appears to be overrun by an evolved artificial intelligence known as S.A.R. (Study. Analyze. Reprogram.) A robot clearly doing what it's programmed for. Capt. Bukes (Thure Lindhardt) heads up the team in Michael Biehn fashion with a few likable and distinctive characters among the unit. All them chaperoning Mills, (Vanessa Kirby) a more human than android with cybernetic enhancements to investigate the anomaly. It obvious that the team are picked off strategically and in quite the gruesome, desensitised method as S.A.R. learns more about the team. Mills posing as possibly a threat or weakness to either side, her character being quite the source for paranoia adding to the thrilling element of the story, making it not totally predictable. Other teams players are quite well developed like David Ajala's Drifter and Mike Noble's Goodwin, but I found Bentley Kalu's character of sniper Robinson my most favourable, those cybernetic enhancement enables him to shoot around corners and from behind cover using his rifle's scope. The actually design of the robots is brilliant. Swinging more to sinister aura of Saturn 3's Hector than of The Terminator. The drones are a little less imaginative but the key robots achieve the frightful presence with its focusing, blue neon lenses and their sharp unhesitant components. The sound effects are good too, the humming and whirling of motors turning, symbolising the robots thinking. Stephen Hilton's score sounds like a Harry Gregson-Williams remixed version of Brad Fiedel's Terminator theme but suits the film perfectly. This is a good example of how a good film can come from a low budget. Yes, it's not blockbuster high-end and yes, it feels like a copy or better, an amalgamation of classic eighties sci-fis some of us grew up on. But that's just it, it's good, easy watching entertainment I can see a lot of hardcore Sci-fi action fans will enjoy.

" A great film
",0.6249,0.8255,2017-01-13 00:00:00,7,"Well not perfect, but certainly far better than most budget films out there these days. But without knowing the actual production budget it makes difficult judging or guessing just how budget a film it actually was.Either way, the CGI was right up there with decent major budget global films in my opinion and lots of detail and efforts in the CGI department. So well done to the CGI people on this film.Acting was well above average for once to. Story was OK and not to much to complain about even if a lack of real back story. But back story aside and the ending maybe leaves things open for a sequel in the future. As this is 1 budget film that looks good enough to deserve a sequel.All in all a very solid production."
