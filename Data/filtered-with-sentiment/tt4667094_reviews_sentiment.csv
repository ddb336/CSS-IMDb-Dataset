" A Wayans movie will be raunchy and occasionally funny
",0.3832,0.5842,2021-03-04 00:00:00,6,"If you're not a Wayans film, don't watch this. If you are, you'll enjoy it. It's not their best, but is better than much of their most recent stuff. I found myself laughing out loud several times - though the 2nd half wasn't as good. I'm surprised at some of the reviews - appearing shocked at the content! Why would you watch a parody of a sado-masochistic movie if you're not expecting potty humor??"
" Painful
",-0.4404,-0.7654,2021-03-01 00:00:00,1,And not in the good way.Literally was hard to watch because of how hard they tried to be funny and failed miserably. Please stop making movies.
" Better than the real 50 shades.
",0.4404,0.8826,2021-02-18 00:00:00,8,"Way more entertaining, sexy, and more realistic chemistry between the leads than in the actual 50 shades movie. Watch this one. It's just silly fun."
" Better than 50 shades of Grey
",0.4767,0.7184,2021-02-01 00:00:00,8,"This movie knows what it is.
A parody. And a damn good one at that.Better acting. Better self awareness and better cinematography.Take it for what it is."
" 50 Shades of Bad
",-0.5423,-0.1688,2021-01-28 00:00:00,2,This movie is so bad that my TV had to throw up. Please don't waste your time on this. When I thought this movie through I realised that is not too hard to write much better screenplay for this movie because the shooting script was awful.
" Mildly Amusing But Still Pretty Bad
",0.09,-0.7,2021-01-13 00:00:00,3,A spoof of 50 Shades of Grey that is overdone and heavy handed. Much of it makes very little sense. Even cameos with Jane Seymour and Florence Henderson can't save it. Best to invest your time somewhere else.
" Thee Worst Movie Seen In My Life!
",-0.6588,0.9265,2020-12-30 00:00:00,2,"What I can say, awful awful, just awful! Only 2 single scenes in the monstrausity provided me with laughter out loud, all of the rest was complete and utter stupidity, made absolutely no sense.Very poorly written, directed, and filming , was just horrible too! Its a shame because I wanted to really like this, because Marlon Wayans, I consider to be a very talented comedian, and his former show on NBC , Marlon was excellent, he was great in that show & acted great in it as well. Thing is he did not write or produce that. MOVIE IS A COMPLETE DISSASTER! I really need the 2 hours of my life back, wasted on this gatbage! Did not pay for it thank Goodness, watched 4 free on a HBO Max trial."
" Could have been better/funnier
",0.0,0.9866,2020-10-25 00:00:00,3,"As being a parody of Fifty Shades of Grey (although haven't seen the original), expectations of this film weren't too high as was expecting a silky over the top comedy with a few casual clever gags.Well this film is as expected but still not very good. The plot is essentially the same as the original, just as a Marlon Wayan's version. There are a few laughs and don't decent gags but overall expected a little better. There were more misfires than hits, and a lot of jokes felt far too forced.After all, Marian Wayan's comedies are for a selective audience and if you are familiar with his work or have enjoyed some if his previous material, you may enjoy this. Although Fifty Shades of Black isn't better than a Haunted House."
" 50 Shades of Nothing
",0.0,-0.7096,2020-07-21 00:00:00,1,"I tried to watch this movie but after only 15 minutes I could not continue to put myself through the assault on my intelligence. If they were going for shock value for the depravity in language, lewd gestures and an attempt at acting they succeeded.Dumb and Dumber which I also disliked is like a literary achievement compared to this movie."
" Worst movie
",-0.6249,-0.5575,2020-04-25 00:00:00,1,"I realize they wanted to spoof of the fifty shades movies but this movie is bad omg they shouldn't have made this movie. Some parts are trying to be funny and they aren't, some jokes are trying to be funny and they aren't, and some acting aren't that great either."
" Typical Wayans...
",0.0,0.9919,2020-04-06 00:00:00,5,"I've always been a fan of the Wayans brothers but appreciate that there is little middle ground with most people falling into two catagories of either loving or hating their stuff. There is also a lot of discussion regarding the content (especially racial) of their films. All this aside, they have found a successful formula so can't really blamed for running for it. Hollywood has done it constantly for years now and few complain about that.I actually watched this before watching the film that this parodies. I'm unsure if that was the right thing to do or not, but if you have not seen Fifty Shades of Grey, this should still satisfy their fans, or fans or downright silly and extreme sexual humour (with plenty of racial stereotypes thrown in as usual). The film never lets up with the absurd jokes and senarios and if you have seen Grey, this pretty much parodies that film scene for scene (even down to the dialogue at times).Marlon Wayans plays Christian Black, a billionaire businessman who has made his money the way most black entrepreneurs have. No not through real estate, but drugs. Kali Hawke plays Steale, the niaeve and shy young woman who Christian quickly becomes obsessed with. Unless you have been living under a rock or in the middle of the rainforest, I'm sure by now most people are aware of the content of Shades and how much controvery and critisism both the books and the film have received.The jokes here and dumb, silly, slapstick, crude and sexual in nature, playing largely on the BDSM content. A lot of these jokes miss, a lot are funny if you leave your brain down the road before watching. I really do not understand the critisim this particular parody has recieved though. Wayons does what he does, and while of late his acting and writing may not be up to what it once was, you should know what to expect from one of his films by now. Why watch and then compain about the offensive humour? I thinksome people like to moan for the sake of hearing their own voices.To sum up, this is not a good film, but it does have its funny moments and is not a film to anylise in great detail but to watch, giggle, facepalm and then forget. If you're a fan of Wayans and of crude sexual jokes then give this a try but don't be expecting any great comical genius from it.
The Sage's Rating: 6/10"
" Great madness üòÅ
",0.296,0.4926,2020-02-11 00:00:00,10,This is ten million times better than fifty shades of gray has ever dreamed of being!
" Disgusting
",-0.5267,0.3462,2020-01-16 00:00:00,1,"This was the most unoriginal and unsavory parody movie I've ever seen. When I added it to my watch list after I watched ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" (which is my most favorite movie of all time) and it showed up in the suggestions, I was under the impression that the title was the only rip-off, so I was taken aback by the unpacking of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" scene by scene ad nauseam."
" COMEDY ISN'T THAT HARD
",0.4207,0.7649,2020-01-14 00:00:00,2,"Who wrote this garbage!!
If i gathered some friends and shot a movie it would've been funnier, there is absolutely nothing funny about it, not even one single scene ""except for king Bach's"", the only good thing about this movie is King Bach actually"
" 50 shades of crap
",-0.3818,-0.3425,2019-12-31 00:00:00,4,Definitely a stinker. Not really that funny. I cant reccomend this one.
" This movie made me asexual
",0.0,0.9022,2019-12-14 00:00:00,2,"I get that this is a spoof movie but I cringed during every scene. There were some funny bits and the fact that the movie was self-aware made me chuckle.But other than that this was just stale bread and tasteless. If this is what the actual movie is like, than I'm grateful I watched this instead"
" Well heck
",0.2732,0.6597,2019-11-20 00:00:00,6,"Still better then the original.
Watch this instead of 50 shades of grey."
" Embarrassing Production
",-0.3818,-0.8735,2019-09-18 00:00:00,1,"Hard to believe Florence Henderson's and Jane Seymour would agree to be a part of this movie. It always bothers me when actors and actresses who, after having long and successful careers, lower themselves and take parts in awful films like this. The first thing I think is how disparate they must me to work again. Same thing goes for well-established actors who appear in commercials. If they totally blew all the money they earned during their careers, ok they need a job. But most haven't and are simply earning a nice fat paycheck from a sponsor. Florence Henderson died shortly after this movie came out and was the last film in which she appeared. Sad her last appearance was on such a low note. And I would think Jane Seymour would just be embarrassed."
" What a guilty pleasure
",0.2263,0.8932,2019-08-20 00:00:00,6,This movie is not a masterpiece at all... but definitely a funny slap stick raunchy comedy!
" Great Parody Movie
",0.6249,0.8,2019-08-10 00:00:00,9,First of all I cannot understand why the current featured review of this movie is by someone who admits he hasn't seen 50 Shades of Gray ... that makes him totally unqualified.This was a great parody. Kali Hawk bears a striking resemblance to Dakota Johnson. Kali's performance is impeccable; she captures every detail of Dakota.It's also difficult to understand the low ratings. If you saw Gray you'll love Black.
" my notes
",0.0,-0.1644,2019-06-26 00:00:00,6,A lot of jokes missed but i laughed a lot. very similar to haunted house 1&2 (2 viewings)
" It's more sexual than it's funny.
",0.4404,0.4497,2019-06-05 00:00:00,4,"I just don't find this deserve your time. Yes there is a big laughs but not a lot, just few. Then the plot repeats its self again and again in the movie."
" So awful it makes you love ""Fifty Shades of Gray"" in comparison!
",0.2957,-0.9904,2018-11-06 00:00:00,1,"""Fifty Shades of Black"" is yet another film in the idiotic teenager parody genre. This overused genre consists of many movies currently on IMDB's Bottom 100 list....with the likes of ""Disaster Movie"" (#1), ""Epic Movie"" (#12), ""Date Movie"" (#24), ""Scary Movie V"" (#50), ""The Starving Games"" (#44) and ""Extreme Movie"" (#99). ""Fifty Shades of Black"", incidentally, is #65 on this infamous list of badness. Unlike other films in this god-awful genre, this film is a parody of another film on the infamous Bottom 100 list, the original ""Fifty Shades of Gray"" (#92).This film is a bit different from the other crappy parodies I mentioned above. It is more a silly version of the original film and is NOT a parody of a dozen or more other films (which the above garbage films all are). Also, not surprisingly, it's MUCH more sexually-oriented...as ""Fifty Shades of Gray"" was a highly sexualized story. But this is much more crude than I even expected...and crude and unfunny scenes were piled on atop the other! It also has a lot of content that might make the more left-leaning audience members cringe or become furious. The leading man in this film is rich and successful like the one in the original story...BUT because he's black (Marlon Wayans), he says he made his fortune selling crack and sucking....well...IMDB won't let me say more about that. This is NOT the most positive and uplifting sort of black man, that's for sure!As far as the story goes, it's terrible....so terrible I found I much preferred the original film...which I still strongly dislike. Yes, they managed to make a worse version of an already terrible movie! Offensive, brain-numbingly stupid, crude beyond belief, and, sadly, a film marketed mostly towards younger folks (whose growing brains really don't need this!). Currently, this film is #65 on the Bottom 100....I think that is way, way too generous...especially after seeing the Florence Henderson (I am NOT kidding) sex scene!"
" its just, one of ""thooosssee"" movies, ya know?
",0.0,0.9224,2018-08-11 00:00:00,2,"Like disaster movie, date movie, scary movie blah blah its one of those c grade random comedies, which arent the best but ya know, theyre alright to just waste an hour to, not complete trash but kinda close? like it is what it is, its not trying to be an amazing film perse, it knows its a random film and therefore thats what it is and what it strives to be, gotta just accept it for what it is and realize its not gonna be an astonishing masterpiece"
" Disneyland for grownups
",0.0,-0.8376,2018-03-20 00:00:00,4,"This is an urban spoof of the film ""50 Shades of Grey."" As expected the humor is crude. The jokes were hit and miss. The film seems forced as if they were rushed to get the film on tape and didn't bother to develop their jokes, instead relying on crude humor. Not nearly as good as Marlon Wayans' other works. There are some good lines, but not enough to carry the film.Guide: F-bomb, sex, fake male nudity."
" Funny but, not Hilarious
",-0.2351,0.9902,2017-11-24 00:00:00,6,"""Fifty Shades of Black"" (2016) is an entertaining film. The story is a direct parody of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" where college student, Hannah Steele played by Kali Hawk, falls for unorthodox billionaire, Christian Black played by Marlon Wayans, but his sexual practices put a strain on what could become a beautiful relationship. The story is there for what could have been a heavy dose of comedy, but it doesn't seem to mesh well as the film could have.The director, Michael Tiddes known for over the top comedies like ""A Haunted House"" (2013), stayed true the style of comedy. Ever comedic take had funny laced in the dialogue or visuals and then amplified to drive it home. Occasionally it was a bit much. The music that filled most of the film was very intertwining and relatively spot on but, there were a few lapses in the sound department. Some of the voice-overs missed the mark and took away from the film. Overall, it was just OK but, still an enjoyably film."
" A very bad ""comedy""
",-0.5849,0.9917,2017-08-16 00:00:00,3,"An apparently filthy rich guy meets a poor but attractive young girl, eager for a new and more interesting life. This new person that enters her life is about to show her a part of fetishism and fantasy that she never thought about before.It's an ordinary comedy inspired directly from ""50 Shades of Grey"" and seems to take the parody part to the extreme. It simply makes fun of everything portrayed in the original movie, without any shame (which could be a good thing), but unfortunately without any sense of fun. It tries desperately to make you laugh but as it happens with every single movie that does this, it fails miserably. You struggle to find a couple of funny scenes, laughter being something rare in this one although it's supposed to be a full-time comedy. The plot is not something to take into account as well as all the characters from this so called movie.It's not a disappointment because didn't have high expectations regarding it but it is without any doubt a very bad movie from every point of view, something from which you should run, far, far away."
" Like gazing into the abyss
",0.3612,0.9136,2017-05-13 00:00:00,1,"Can a film cause physical pain? Fifty Shades of Black answers that question with a resounding, mind-shattering ""yes"". I now know what resuscitation feels like, since as soon as the credits appeared - and Marlon Wayans' face disappeared from the screen - I felt oxygen return to my brain and hope return to my soul. I think that this film actively killed my interest in not only parodies, but just comedy in general. I don't know if I can laugh again. Marlon Wayans took joy away from me. I had to embark on a quest to a Tibetan monastery to cleanse my soul of this filth. I remember when movies were an escape from the pain of real life. Now, they have become the nightmare."
" Hardly a noteworthy spoof...
",0.0,0.9748,2017-04-28 00:00:00,5,"Of course Wayans would delve in a spoof and farce on the success of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"". And it is, of course, done in the very same formula and routine that every other Wayans spoof is done, so there is no deviation to be expected here.And with the fact established that the very same, and too often abused, formula applied to the movie, you can expect very little in terms of originality, concept or surprises. So if you are a big fan of the numerous other Wayans spoofs, then chances are very high that you will enjoy this one too. But personally, then I think that formula has been worn down to the bone and it is time for Wayans to go back to the creative corner and come up with something new.The end result that is ""Fifty Shades of Black"" turned out to be not particularly funny. Sure, there were some good laughs here and there throughout the course of the movie, because of the jokes or the situations. But in overall, then this was a very generic and flaccid movie, which could have been a lot more funnier with some more creative and original writing.I will actually go as far as saying that if you have seen any one of the many previous Wayans spoofs, then you have essentially also already seen ""Fifty Shades of Black"".Now, I haven't seen the ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" movie, nor read the book, and I have no intention to do so. So how much or how little ""Fifty Shades of Black"" stays true to the original source material.However, all in all, then ""Fifty Shades of Black"" was just another generic spoof comedy that failed to stand out or leave any real lasting impression."
" Is it black or grey?
",0.0516,0.9222,2017-04-24 00:00:00,2,"The first ""meeting"" of the main female character and Mr. Black is maybe the high point of the whole affair (excuse the pun). It kind of depicts how ridiculous the other movie is. But then again, we already knew that didn't we? There are a couple of scenes that hold their own just because they have such a simple and easy task, when you go back to the source material.There is one scene though that tries to make fun of Whiplash, in a sexual context. While the overall idea isn't that bad, the execution is very weak. I guess we have to an understanding at this point, that Mr. Wayans will do anything silly, and he has an audience for that, that he keeps happy I reckon. So this niche gets served too. There is some nudity if you wonder, but all in all it's just juvenile"
" Got What I Expected
",0.0,0.8047,2017-04-01 00:00:00,4,Spoiler alert for Fifty Shades of Grey as well for it is a parody with the exact plot. Fifty Shades of Parody. To say that this was better than the movie it was spoofing shows you just how bad that movie was. The only reason Grey was doing better than Black in the box office is due to there being a cult following of the books the Grey movies were based on. Those who either did not like the books or the Grey movies might be able to enjoy this. However a greater population do not know about the books or the movies or what they were about before watching this movie or are loyal fans of Grey. Christian Black is not a likable character as he was verbally abusive to Hannah Steel and generally has commitment issues. Maybe a little over the top but not far off from the Christian Grey character. Hannah is also just like Anastasia Steel in the way she always says 'I don't want to be controlled or submissive' but then always does exactly what she is told. Mostly at first she was amused by the idea of getting spanked and then she gets serious since Christian Grey is only in it for the sex and says she wants to find out just how intense things would get before leaving. The movie follows the same plot but ends with no to be continued like the movie it was spoofing thank god. This movie is probably worth watching only once and also does not require a sequel.
" Funny as Always. . . Some lagging areas..But, Overall Good Jokes
",0.6908,0.9781,2017-03-26 00:00:00,7,"Marlon takes aim at everyone in his humor in this movie. I found his political jokes quite funny. I really enjoyed the way they laid it into the writers and makers of the original movie. I never saw it because I thought the entire premise was sick and ridiculous. My view of that movie is pretty much in line with Marlon's, and his remake gave me many good laughs. There were many parts which could offend women, different races, political views, but especially fans of the original movie. lol.He does not hold back though, and I always find him to be original and funny. Just a little more effort and time on some of these and he could make them much bigger for all to enjoy. Thanks Marlon for all your works."
" 50 shades of garbage.
",0.0,0.8303,2017-03-25 00:00:00,1,Marlon has turned into quite the hunk so it was nice seeing him in certain scenes so for me that was a plus.However that one and only positive for me personally out of the way this movie was truly a disaster movie.The humor was disgusting and I'm nowhere close to being a prude one potentially hot scene regarding Marlons stripping spoofing magic Mike was ruined by throwing in an incredibly disgusting part involving Marlons underwear.The humor was miss every single time and the supporting characters were incredibly obnoxious especially the lead characters best friend a white girl trying to be black she was like nails on a chalkboard .Nothing about this movie was redeemable even though Marlon Wayans is indeed a stud in this film my personal opinion anyways.
" Fifty Shades Of Black
",0.0,0.9724,2017-02-19 00:00:00,1,"If I watch this movie a dozen more times I wonder if it will eventually get funny.I watched it once & once was 1 time too many.I struggled & strained to sit through the entire thing.I don't think I laughed once while watching it.I might have grinned, smiled, or smirked, but I never truly laughed.I know I spent the majority of the time cringing.I watch anything and everything the Wayans put out and usually find them funny.White Girls did suck but it didn't suck as bad as 50 Shades Of Black did.The funniest thing about 50 Shades Of Black was the trailer.It's what made me really want to see it.Maybe if I would've seen 50 Shades Of Grey or even read the book (I have NO interest in doing either) before watching this, I might have enjoyed this movie or liked it but even then I really don't think so.There were so many parts where they just tried way too hard to get a laugh (Like the belly button scene for example.See what I mean?) I'm a BIG fan of potty humor but here it was WAY too overdone & the only thing it made me do was feel awkward.The only way I can see anybody finding 50 Shades Of Black funny is if they're high on drugs or completely drunk.I would suggest you only recommend this movie to people you don't like"
" Hilarious, if you watch it in increments
",0.4019,0.99,2017-01-05 00:00:00,6,"This movie is better suited to a YouTube mini series or a Vine-style comedy. It is hilarious, but only if you don't actually watch the whole thing in one sitting.I watched this movie during study breaks at about 10-20 minute increments at a time. It is definitely cringe-worthy and there are some scenes where the humour is really grasping at straws.But one thing the film has going for it, is that it really follows the original 50 Shades to a T, and when it pokes fun at it, it's really spot on. I personally hated 50 Shades of Grey, and enjoyed spending my breaks entertaining myself with senseless humour every so often. I can't imagine actually sitting through the whole 1 hour and a half of it in one sitting, but I did appreciate the laughs this movie gave me. Best enjoyed in increments - Probably not the best compliment a movie could have, but it does enhance the watching experience in my opinion."
