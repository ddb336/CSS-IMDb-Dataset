" Fantastic Sequel to a Classic

" Better than the first Bad Santa.
",-0.1531,0.8258,2020-12-05 00:00:00,10,It's a really hilarious and rude film and Thurman has grown but not lost any weight. Sunny the mother of Willie is a rude and mean but funny person. I find the film better than the first one is because it's funnier and makes more sense like I don't know. I hope they'll make a Bad Santa 3 in the future.
" Entertained me during lockdown
",0.4019,-0.9758,2020-12-02 00:00:00,5,"Hilarious, shocking and entertaining too. A few weak spots. I did not like the subplot where Willie is stalked by that strange young man.
Definitely watch if you're not into tame comedy. Not alot of gross out moments, but a whole lot of swearing, dirty sex and one suicide attempt. Billy Bob Thornton is very believable as the depressed violent alcoholic."

" Such a beautiful continuation.
",0.5994,0.6652,2020-09-28 00:00:00,7,"The use of the classical music is awesome... Also, somewhere in the movie, the mother says that willie was born in january but willie corrects her, saying that he was born on the 4th of august, which is the real birthday of the main actor playing willie... Recommend the movie to everyone who wants to spend an hour an a half for pure enjoyment..."

" Bad Santa 2 is just barely an ok sequel
",-0.3774,0.6338,2020-02-18 00:00:00,5,"I really liked the first Bad Santa movie. It was original in its brashness and in its humility. The second film, Bad Santa 2, set 13 years later has nothing original about it. I would rate it as a positive 5 star review only because it does have a few shining moments that reminded me of how good the first movie was back when.Bad Santa 2 suffers from what almost always occurs with sequels when the director cannot come up with a new idea on how to tell an old story. With sequels that do not have an original idea, it will either be way more violence or way more sexual content.Bad Santa 2 relies almost solely on bad sexual content jokes throughout. It is so laden with them that it is not even funny anymore. To top that off, new characters, old characters, and even supporting characters need to find ways to divulge about their sexual desires. Whenever the film does try to add in dialogue that does not center around sex, many times it feels like a rehash of lines from the original. And where expletives were used with feeling in the first film, this film uses expletives like it uses the sex talk, as if it became a normal daily routine.The film does explain plot points from the previous film. It tells you why Willie Soke is not with his previous girlfriend, why the kid(who is now a young adult) keeps following him around, and how he ends up meeting back up with his sidekick Marcus from the first film.What saved this film was the relationship between Willie Soke(Billy Bob Thorton) and Thurman Murman(Bret Kelly). There is a moral light at the end of the tunnel in this film between those two characters that for the briefest of song moments returns you to what made part of the first Bad Santa film such a good movie.A few reviewers have written that watching Bad Santa 2 will destroy your memory of the first film. I do not agree. It added another chapter to the story, just not a very good one. But like Hangover 2, my recommendation would be that it is a movie you will probably only watch once and that is it."
" Why was this bad ?
",-0.628,-0.5334,2020-02-13 00:00:00,4,This film had a lot of potential with just copying the last one but it couldn't even do that right. The foulmouthed Bill Bob couldn't even save this one.
" Bad Santa 2
",-0.5423,-0.9754,2020-01-01 00:00:00,3,"The first film was a good punch in the face for the usual sentimental feel-good festive movies, but I don't think anybody was expecting, or even wanting, a sequel, but it happened, and I had a feeling it wasn't going to work before I had even watched it, directed by Mark Waters (Freaky Friday, Mean Girls, Just Like Heaven). Basically, set thirteen years after the previous events, Willie Soke (Billy Bob Thornton) is now working as a valet driver for a country club, he is still depressed, and he is again addicted to sex and alcohol. He tries to hang himself to death but is interrupted by a visit Thurman ""The Kid"" Merman (Brett Kelly), who has turned twenty-one and works at a sandwich shop. Thurman's father has abandoned him, and his grandmother has passed away two years before, so Willie is the closest thing to family he has left. Thurman delivers a package to Willie, it contains a large sum of cash, from Marcus Skidmore (Tony Cox), his former partner who has been released from jail. Marcus, expressing sincere remorse for betraying Willie, tells Willie there is a new money-making opportunity in Chicago, that could be worth millions. Willie reluctantly agrees, while unsuccessfully trying to help Thurman lose his virginity before he leaves for Chicago. When they arrive, Willie is annoyed to find out the scheme involves a children's charity, but much more so that their partner is Willie's estranged mother, Sunny (Kathy Bates). Willie reluctantly agrees, as Sunny is suffering from Parkinson's Disease, though he secretly makes a deal with Marcus to cut Sunny out when the time comes. Willie is forced to dress as Santa Claus once again, he ends up getting arrested after getting into a fight with another man dressed as Santa (Mike Starr), mistaking him for being a paedophile. Willie is bailed out by the charity's founders, Diane Hastings (Christina Hendricks). She initially wants to fire Willie for his bad behaviour, but he agrees to attend AA (alcoholics anonymous) meetings with her. Diane's husband Regent (Ryan Hansen), who also runs the charity and is cheating on Diane with his secretary, orders his head security guard Dorfman (Jeff Skowron) to track and follow Willie, becoming suspicious of how much time he's spending with Diane. Meanwhile, Marcus tries to obtain the keys to Regent's office where the charity's safe is kept, by seducing security guard Gina De Luca (Jenny Zigrino), but finds she is ""high maintenance"". Elsewhere, Willie starts a sexual relationship with Diane, and he and Sunny start to bond, especially when the two of them rob a mansion together posing as Santa and Mrs. Claus. As they bond over their takings, Sunny gives Willie a gun so he can take revenge on Marcus, despite Willie's insistence that Marcus has changed. Thurman has tracked Willie and arrives in Chicago. Willie at first considers leaving him at a laundromat but soon takes him to the shelter at the charity. Thurman ends up joining the children's choir, they will perform a concert on the same night as the planned heist. Willie approaches Gina himself, they have sex in the bathroom of a bar, and he obtains the keys. It is the night of the performance and the robbery, Willie manages to catch Thurman singing, which makes the kid very happy. As Willie cracks the safe, Marcus is about to betray him again, but Regent and Dorfman catch them in the act. However, Sunny reveals she is betraying them both, telling Willie the bullets in the gun she gave him are blanks before shooting Marcus. She tries to escape by disappearing into a crowd of people dressed as Santa at an outdoor party with Willie, Regent and Dorfman chasing her. Willie catches her and attempts to take the bag of stolen cash by saying the kids need it more. In their struggle, the bag is torn open and the money flies into the crowd. Enraged, Sunny attempts to shoot Willie again, but hits Thurman jumps in the path of the bullet and gets hit in his behind. Both Sunny and Willie are arrested, but Willie is not charged for helping to catch Sunny. While he recovers, Willie is visited in the hospital by Diane who wakes him up with a handjob. He later takes a job as a janitor at the charity, goes to visit Thurman and accepts him as family. Willie also visits an injured Marcus, ""tea bagging"" him and posting pictures of this on Instagram, as revenge against Marcus. Also starring Octavia Spencer as Opal. Thornton is still swearing and boozing constantly, but it's not as good as before, Cox as the ""elf"" sidekick is okay, Kelly as the slow-witted teenage ""kid"" is odd rather than cute, and Bates throws herself into the role of the equally rude mother, but she is almost out of place. The first film is a cult favourite with its deadpan humour, digs at the Christmas stuff and constant profanity and deadpan humour, unfortunately this sequel doesn't quite hit the mark, I did titter sometimes, but overall it is a relatively disappointing seasonal comedy. Adequate!"
" Much better than the original, with its melancholic VIBE and ALTERNATIVE CHRISTMAS MESSAGE
",0.5994,0.6458,2019-12-30 00:00:00,9,"The hypocrats who say the movie is bad, aren't honest or objective, even to themselves. I do not know what they expected from this sequel, when its pretty damn obvious that it will be full of f* words and jokes and not gonna be politically correct either. So it seems to me, like people who complain and put a negative reviews here, are hypocrites and pretend to be goody-goody. Also, they just didnt get the point of this movie. The movie has alternative message.
I absolutely love this movie and think it is underrated.
This movie is better than the original, because the depth is added to it, in a part where it shows relationship between Willie and his mom (Kathy Bates). You start to get why Willie is so self-destructive. He didnt have much choice what way to be, really. Its like in real life: even your mom does not necessarily genuinely loves you. And maybe it is actually easier to find unconditional love somewhere else, than expect it from those, who suppose to. Even parents betray, yes. At the end of the day, your accomplice in crime might be far decent person, than your parent, who suppose to love and care for you.
The movie is full of alrernative christmas message for those, who had/has disfunctional family and a tough upbringing. Well, if you have brain, you will see it. It actually has some depth, not just a cheap laughs. So, I think a lot of people who put negative reviews just don't get it.
It has this melancholic vibe, and it is refrechingly different."
" Very poor compared to the first film.
",-0.5256,0.4672,2019-12-26 00:00:00,1,"Must have been very easy for the actors to memorize their lines as all they do is spend the entire film telling each other to 'F off'.
Funny for the first 5 seconds but not so for the rest of the film"
" Better than the original!
",0.6696,0.925,2019-12-24 00:00:00,8,"I realize most people can't be objective about sequels. The main criticism is that this one lacked originality. How most manage to miss the point. It certainly had its own personality. More vulgarity, better one-liners, more non-stop laughs and the filming location had an important ingredient, snow! The addition of the incomparable (Kathy Bates) put this over any of the original cast. She added a depth that only she could, but definitely delivered in the filth department. I was impressed with the chemistry between her and (Billy Bob Thornton). His relationship with the kid was even more precious this time, especially the choir solo scene. In closing, both Bad Santa flicks are a refreshing antithesis to the endless Christmas banality that's churned out."
" Welcome mediocrity
",0.4019,-0.6249,2019-12-24 00:00:00,4,"Bad guy gets sexual proposition from mentally retarded young guy of 21 y.o., punches his mother, is sexually harassed by all women.
Off course, his partner is ridicoulous and can't manage to get any of them.
Sex is you've guessed the funny part.
Finally, except very few dialog lines/situations, i've only felt pity for people working for this movie.
Good luck for watchers"
" Worse than the first one
",-0.4767,-0.7909,2019-12-24 00:00:00,1,"I didn't finish it. It has nasty, filthy language and is absolutely not funny. I wish Kathy Bates had turned this down. I lost respect."
" Yuk
",0.0,-0.6678,2019-10-28 00:00:00,1,I was shocked at the really disgusting dialogue - pfff not for me & seriously Cathy Bates & billy bob you really were dredging the muck here. Yuk Yuk.
" Bad Santa...yes..really BAD!!
",-0.8525,-0.8847,2019-09-13 00:00:00,2,"After this I had to question if maybe i was carrying some false (happy) memories of the original.
I remember it being hillarious and looked forward to the 2nd, but boy was i in for a let down!!
This was just SOoooo BAD!The script was horrible.
There was NO laughs whatsoever, just a lot of cussing and deviate sexual stuff that seemed to only aim for shock value.
Whatever they were aiming for, it definately was NOT laughs.
Id be suprised if even a 16 year old found anything even slightly amusing in this.The swearing did nothing and was just really OTT for no reason.
Even the acting performaces came over as ""clunky"" in execution.
Indeed, it seemed like (and quite rightly) the actors just wanted to get off their horrible lines, wrap the whole mess up, and get the hell out of there as quickly as possible.I cant believe Thornton read the script and actually went through with this.
I'd certainly never bother with anything he does in future again, after having this monstrosity burnt into my movie memory.I always scorned reviewers who give one star to movies, as it would mean a film is void of even a single redeeming factor.
But yeah, im giving this 2, only because i dont wanna be that guy..Still scratching my head to think of any redeeming factors though...
just plain terrible!!"
" As foul-mouthed and unpleasant a movie as you will ever see
",-0.4767,-0.8557,2019-03-24 00:00:00,7,"Most people probably won't like this. It is as foul-mouthed, unpleasant, and politically incorrect a comedy as one is likely to find anywhere - but therein lies its power. In this sequel flick, the bad santa joins up with his midget buddy for a trip to Chicago, where they meet up with santa's mom for a little larceny and lunacy. Bates, Thornton, and Cox make for a solid team of goofy outlaws."
" 2 live crew
",0.0,0.8395,2019-02-20 00:00:00,10,"Since BAD SANTA 2 was brave enough to use a ""2 live crew"" in the film, i want to see a ""2 live crew"" film. Yes, the film is incredibally nasty, but you are hollywood and can perfect this without a ton of problems. Dont skimp on the ratings system. i know it costs alot of money to make an NC-17 film but the band was very free in their speech, so what! ""Banned in the USA"""
" ECHOES THE FIRST MOVIE BUT DEFINATELY HAS FLAWS
",0.0,0.9739,2019-02-01 00:00:00,6,"This sequel to the 2003 original has the same lewd humour as its predocessor and it does have its laughs and the red head with the big boobs is awesome, thornton and cox deliver like the last time out but the scene when willy punches his mother is just a tad O.T.T lol ridiclious! i think the scene should have been more subtle, the kid returning as a young man was unrealistic and silly the lad is even more gullable than the little boy in the first outing and i dont think it works, the actor put on the weight to look like his younger self , he should have returned his usual self with a change of direction in character then maybe this might just have lived up to the more superior original."
" Good laugh
",0.7579,-0.2617,2019-01-06 00:00:00,8,"Political incorrect film with loads of obsence language. Won't suit all people, but if you generally liked Bad Santa 1 you wontnmind this."
" Quite a step down
",0.0,0.8497,2018-12-27 00:00:00,5,"Bad Santa 2 is another sequel which in Hollywood takes original cult classic or well original films, and releasing over 10 years. Bad Santa 2 came out 13 years after the original, released in 2003 and quite a bit has changed since.This film seems to step up in the vulgar, shock value and overall disgusting behavior compared to the original. And with all of that, Bad Santa 2 falls short and simply isn't as funny as the original. There are since some laughs but overall, the original has a better feeling with its pace, plot and is overall more interesting. Better grouping of characters as well.Billy Bob Thornton is his same self which is great as the role of Bad Santa, same with Tony Cox. Kathy Bates as the mother is decent. Bad Santa 2 uses the same formula as Bad Santa but since nothing is much shocking anymore, there isn't much in which we have not seen."
" Vulgar Beyond Belief, Stupid and a Waste of Time
",-0.7351,-0.2591,2018-12-18 00:00:00,1,"I have no problem with foul language, but in this case, this sorry excuse for a movie seems to be nothing but a vehicle to see how many times they can say f-this, f-that, f-you. It's not at all an exaggeration to say that they can't go more than 60 seconds without some kind of expletive. However, constant swearing does not a movie make, especially when most of it is uncalled for. It just makes it all very boring and tedious. Unfunny, stupid, the writers obviously had nothing. It was painful to watch, and endlessly disgusting. Unless you live in a trailer and think that's just great, save yourself and don't bother watching this utter garbage."
" Not as good as the first but not bad
",0.4717,-0.7498,2018-12-08 00:00:00,5,An enjoyable and often funny film that is not as good as the first but still good to see billy bob playing the role and the supporting cast was good too except for Kathy Bates who was disgusting. She's a good actress but the things she said and did were terrible lol. The script should of been better too much vulagarity. Otherwise good.
" Bad santa 2 (2016)
",-0.5423,0.9042,2018-12-08 00:00:00,6,Bad santa 2 tries to bring back the old experience of the outstanding predecessor but falls short.Not bad.But the innovativeness and the dark humour was a bit bland.Still when you love the character there is always something to it.Overall - 3/5
" Same formula but too foul-mouthed
",0.0,0.0825,2018-12-02 00:00:00,5,"Same formula as the first so entertaining from that perspective, but script lacks, too much foul language, and Bates character was just weird and unnecessary."
" One of these stars is out of sympathy
",0.3612,0.715,2018-07-26 00:00:00,2,"Bad Santa 2 is bad. It has the feel of a tacky, cash grab kids movie, with all of the profanity you could ever want and more. I swear all the f#$%Ing time, I'm also a young horny guy, but this film takes no rest. It depends on it, for some reason.Plot- Picture the first Bad Santa. Okay, now watch the trailer for this movie. Then, add a typical douchebag as a villain and a trashy over the top Kathy Bates. Finally, imagine a derivative ending to it all, followed by a montage of testicle photos on Tony Cox. It was pretty stupid.Writing- Literally every other line is a sex joke, and if Tony Cox is on the screen, you can bet he's getting grilled for being a midget. I think profanity is great, but the people making this movie have no creativity or timing. Not one single quote.Characters/Acting- Acting wasn't bad at all, but Billy Bob seems a bit less tenacious, when he should be furious by this point of the Bad Santa time line. There are plenty of moments that feel like you're listening to a childs movie in terms of their wording and performance. Quality- The movie was shot well and everything technical is great, but its got no style (not that I need that, I just wanted to walk away with something rewarding) and I don't have much else thereOverall, the first Bad Santa is one of my top 10 favorite movies. It was original, really funny, honest, and even heartwarming. A very underrated christmas movie. This, Bad Santa 2, is just as crappy as it looks. If you like nonstop trash talk and any movie with a good actor, go for it. But I recommend you stay away."
" horrible vulgar low brow FAIL
",-0.87,-0.6633,2018-06-24 00:00:00,1,NOT ONE LAUGH--Vulgar and dumb script no charm and joy as the first Bad Santa a huge FAIL
" Just plain unpleasant
",-0.4767,-0.9727,2018-05-16 00:00:00,5,"Alcoholic disaster Willie Soke, saved from suicide by loveable man-child Thurman Merman, moves to Chicago where he runs up against his old deeply unpleasant dwarf sidekick Marcus Skidmore and his even more deeply unpleasant mother Sunny. Together, the 3 of them plan to rob a charity which hires down-and-outs to be - yes, you guessed it - Santas under the guidance of dodgy philanthropist Regent and his big-breasted sex-starved wife Diane. Crime and sex ensues.I never saw the original, but I get the joke: wouldn't it be funny if there was a Santa whose every quality was diametrically opposed to everything Santa stood for? Well, apparently, it was such a good joke that it merits a sequel, albeit it had to wait for 13 years.This film has an ugly start - the fundamentally unlikeable Wille Soke, bemoaning his life, tries (and fails) to commit suicide. It then moves through a series of unpleasant events in which unlikeable people do unlikeable things (the most likeable of these being when Christina Hendricks repeatedly yells ""F*ck me!"", in the throes of a knee-termbler with a fully-Santa-clothed Billy Bob Thornton against a dumpster down a scuzzy back street alley.The only likeable character is Thurman Merman, 8 years old in the original movie and now 21 but acting in every respect as if he was still 8: a nice character, but not even slightly believable.The film contains profanity on an industrial pollution scale (not unexpected, but not very edifying either) and is profoundly unpleasant in almost every respect.Yet I laughed. Not constantly, and not that deeply, but it did raise chuckles fairly frequently. I suspect that this makes me a bad person, but I take comfort from the fact that I am no worse than the people who made this horrible film.I am ashamed to say that my lower lip trembled during the Silent Night sequence."

It's in everyone's top 5 comedies of all time. If there was no Bad Santa, Bad Santa 2 would be viewed as a decent Christmas movie. It's still better than Elf but it lacks the original creatives, any live interest, both of whom were exceptional in the original. It also lacks the worth adversary like the head of mall security in the original. Plus it feels like it's a bit sanitised.Not terrible but not a patch on the original."
" Not Horrible, But Still Not Very Good.
",-0.3631,0.9663,2018-01-12 00:00:00,5,"The original 'Bad Santa' from 2003 is a raunchy classic. A washed-up Santa and his elf friend annually rob malls they work at; then Santa's habits are catching up with him and he befriends a kid who he grows to care about. The movie is dark, the jokes are hilarious, and there is so much depth in the characters that give the movie its heart.Anything wrong with a sequel to this? Not at all. Anything wrong with a sequel being made more than a decade after the original? Absolutely. One thing almost certain about sequels that are released a decade or more after the predecessor is that is it will be a hugely inferior retread. Case-in-point, 'Bad Santa 2.''Bad Santa' from 2003 was no masterpiece by any means, but at least everything was fresh and its heart was in the right place. The sequel tries to recapture what worked before with only a few elements coming out good.Billy Bob Thornton returns as the sex-addicted alcky, Willie Soke. He's had a bunch of odd jobs since quitting the heist business, but has not amounted to anything and hasn't changed much. Thurman Merman/The Kid still comes by and annoys Willie. This is the essence of both films that played the groundwork. It's The Kid who makes this sequel worth sitting through. Thurman is going to be 21 in a few days and it's funny to see that he hasn't changed much either. There's a few sexual jokes with Willie and The Kid that I'll admit made me laugh a bit.Then familiar and dull territory gets taken advantage of with the arrival of Willie's old sideckick, Marcus. Willie still isn't over his betrayal, but reluctantly accepts Marcus' plan: steal over a million dollars' worth of donations from a homeless shelter in Chicago. Marcus' man on the inside is Willie's mother played by Kathy Bates. One of my favourite actresses ever is one of the major drawback in this film. It didn't hurt to see her play anybody foul-mouthed, its how bad her writing and delivery of it all was. There's someone else bad on the inside who's a rival, and forgettable and impossible to care for.As as I started, this tries to recycle almost everything of the first. Still lots of sex (actually way more sex this time around), lots of booze, lots of swearing, same setups, same results, and very little is actually funny. Not horrid, just stuff to brush off in an instant.The Kid decides to pay a surprise to Willie as an early Christmas present. This element with Thurman comes the closest to reaching the level of the first. Willie and Thurman is not as good here as it was before, but we still very much enjoy them both this time around. Without Thurman Merman and Willie, the movie would have floundered more and my rating would be lower. But as it is, 'Bad Santa 2' is nothing special, yet not an abysmal failure.2/4"

But regardless of this, just like the first movie it is a hilarious adult comedy. I just binge watched both and the first one is just a tad better.

""Santa 2"" should not be in the title. It may be, without any problem, just ""Bad"", because it's bad, as a whole. It has some funny and goofy scenes, but you can barely sketch a smile by them (at least that happened in my case). Don't put it in your watchlist, wishlist, or whatever... It doesn't worth a penny."

The best way to describe it is to remind you of the common preconception of the original ""Bad Santa"", admittedly gleaned from the previews showing at the time: It was popularly understood to be a ""bad boy"" yawp, which contrasted wonderfully with the discovery that it worked marvelously as a touching redemption tale. It was a fantastic Christmas movie for the ages, cleverly disguised as a prurient snack toss-off.Well, ""Bad Santa 2"" IS *that* movie. It is nothing more than the bad-boy snack boredom killer that ""Bad Santa"" was supposed to have been.Even if I discount the original--decide not to judge ""BS2"" by the standard of ""BS""--it *still* simply fails to rise to the level of a film worth watching, if you expect movies to be more than boredom killers. I got one grim chuckle out of the whole thing, and the rest is pretty much just well-produced spectacle. The flick *is* well-produced... but that's it. There's no real mythic payload, except for a tepid and poorly thought out demi-effort to shoehorn a few would-be redemptive moments in, here and there.It's sad. Is it *really* the case that in all of the Hollywood system, not one decent breakthrough screenplay that would do decent service to the gravitas of the franchise was anywhere to be found? Really?I give this a few stars merely for the expert production work. Aesthetically, it's a sump.Go watch the original; specifically, the director's cut. You might cry tears of redemptive joy."
" no longer so outrageously new
",-0.5709,-0.8563,2017-12-21 00:00:00,4,"Willie Soke (Billy Bob Thornton) is still a drunken screw up. Happy endings are BS. He tries to commit suicide only to be saved by The Kid, clueless Thurman Merman. Marcus Skidmore (Tony Cox) gets early release from prison and has a job lined up in Chicago, robbing a charity run by Diane Hastings (Christina Hendricks). They infiltrate by joining the Santa charity and then it's revealed that Willie's mother Sunny Soke (Kathy Bates) is the leader of the scam.It's not funny anymore. It's not so outrageously new. Even the Kid is no longer a kid. He's still chubby but the humor is gone. It's sad to sit thru an unfunny comedy. I wonder if a sequel could be made of him struggling to make it work in the suburbs with Sue. Kathy Bates competes for an ugly off. Billy Bob is lifeless. Hendricks is cold. Not much is funny here."
" Bad Santa 2 is BAD!
",-0.8412,-0.9532,2017-12-13 00:00:00,1,"I am astounded that anyone would give this movie more than one or two stars. But I suppose what's one man's garbage is another man's treasure, and there's no accounting for bad taste. The writers were intent on including every off-color...no wait, every type of disgustingly gross, filthy dialog imaginable, assuming the audience craves this kind of so-called humor. I am no prude, but there was nothing to redeem this movie from the trash heap. Perhaps some viewers will watch this so they can play the drinking game, taking a shot every time the 'F' word and it's derivatives is uttered. If that's the case, expect to succumb to alcohol poisoning by the 30 minute mark."

When I saw Bad Santa 2; from the very start I could not believe it. It was totally hilarious. They brought back the old cast elegantly. You just knew it would be just as great as the last Bad Santa; from the start. My wife who kind of does not like Bad Santa; insisted on watching it to the end, and she rarely feels that way. Kathy Bates being in this movie really brought it home for the woman folk. If it were not for the woman folk that think Kathy Bates is our image of our true self; we would be left behind.

Brett Kelly is back. He is not longer a dumb fat kid, but now is a dumb fat adult. Male fantasy Christina Hendricks has a role and Billy Bob Thornton says the things to her every guy wish they could.The actual robbery was at the end of the film and was anti-climatic in a film that never had a climax...other than that other kind. The movie was filled with sexually crude, over-the-top humor that was amusing from the shock value, but not LOL funny...like a bad Apatow movie. Certainly this is a low point for director Mark Waters. Octavia Spencer was funny as a prostitute, although if you are really that hungry Octavia, I'll make you a sandwich. Co-writer Shauna Cross demonstrates her diversity as she was the screen writer for ""If I Stay"" a polar opposite type of film. Kudos, I think. If you like crude sexually humor, that is what this film is all about.Guide: F-word, sex, crude sex talk, fake scrotum nudity."
" Fun Companion Piece for Fans of The Original
",0.6808,0.9985,2017-07-23 00:00:00,6,"2003's Bad Santa is the ultimate irreverent Christmas movie. If you're burnt out on sappy, overly sweet joy around the holiday season, the dark, raunchy, unashamedly politically incorrect content of the first is the perfect antidote to that. The original also had great performances and a story with some actual heart to it in the end. The sequel, strangely made over a decade later, is more of the same, just not quite as fresh, without as much meaning and heart in it, but still entertaining, especially if like me, you're a fan of the original. The story, following down-on-his luck deadbeat safecracker Willie Soke, kind of tarnishes the happy ending of the original, and in a way undoes a lot of the character development that Willie went through. It's kind of a back-to-square one opening that resets the story to the place of the original, which is more or less what this installment is. I knew that going in and enjoyed some of the foul lines and funny situations, but the original had the support of (unfortunately deceased) gifted performers such as Bernie Mac and John Ritter, both very skilled comedians for Billie Bob to play off of, even Ajay Naidu from Office Space making a cameo. The sequel features Oscar Winners Octavia Spencer and Kathy Bates, as well as Mad Men alumni Christina Hendricks, as well as returning cast members Tony Cox and a grown Brett Kelly, who looks more or less the same just slightly taller. Bates does well as Soke's mother, but the addition of her character to the story sort of feels like the concept getting stretched, which is what this entire movie is. Although still funny, a segment in the film that features a heist of a high-priced estate feels forced and tacked on into the plot, seemingly an excuse to repeat the scene from the original with the kids sitting on Santa's Lap, with Willie confused and disgusted by what they ask for. A lot of the movie is like this, and it suffers from not having the indie-film feel that Ghost World director Terry Zwigoff brought to the original. It feels a bit more stripped down and an imitation of that style, and like I mentioned earlier, it just doesn't have the same heart. I would more or less only recommend this if you've seen the first multiple times and like it, and really want to see more of Willie and his messed up friends, like I did. If you've never seen either, see the original, and if you only thought it was fun for that one time watching it, you should probably leave it at that.I definitely hope that in another 13 years, we don't get yet another Bad Santa. I can't really figure out why they decided to wait so long after the feeling and interest of the original died down to do this, but the concept and idea is officially stretched as far as it can go. The talent on display and some of the genuinely funny laugh lines in this keep this from being firmly average."
" A Worthy sequel
",0.4404,-0.7741,2017-07-18 00:00:00,8,"Lewd, crude, vulgar, and funny as hell. Touching, too. The kid is back and innocent as ever. Kathy Bates is incapable of a bad performance, and nails it as mom. The last 30 seconds was the best part. I was still laughing after it was over. Not for the easily offended or even the moderately offended."
" ""Well it's startin' to feel like Christmas.""
",0.5574,-0.9366,2017-07-18 00:00:00,6,"This movie doubles down on the use of the 'F' word and embellishes it with various scenes of sexual perversion that brings down one's expectation of a humorous follow up to the original ""Bad Santa"". I could almost go with the banter between Willie Sokes (Billy Bob Thornton) and Marcus Skidmore (Tony Cox), but throwing Kathy Bates into the mix as the foul mouthed Mom of Thornton's character was a bit much to take. Not to mention whatever actress Christina Hendricks might have been thinking to appear in the dumpster scene with Willie doing the nasty. I don't think that's exactly what 'Giving City' had in mind before Willie, Marcus and Sunny showed up. I don't know, I found ""Bad Santa"" to be something of a guilty pleasure but this one was way too much of a 'good' thing, if you know what I mean. In other words, ""Bad Santa 2"" was just plain bad."
" If it had a butthole......
",0.0,-0.2803,2017-07-16 00:00:00,7,"This was a decent attempt at rekindling an old flame. The first Bad Santa set a movie trend years ago, and introduced most of the world to Billy Bob Thornton. This installment was a bit of a let down. The jokes were funny, but felt forced and awkward. The interaction between Bates and Thornton was fun, however there was almost too much animosity between Santa and Elf that Elf was a useless character. Not only did they not have much screen time for the Elf, his lines were almost identical to the first movie. SPOILER The heist was almost not even important in the movie, as by the end you pretty much have lost interest. It is a sad relationship to see between Kathy and Billy's Characters as is most typical family drama. I didn't care for the three of them turning on each other BUT it was hilarious to see Elf get shot AND ran over. That was one of the most realistic scenes I've yet to see on screen. Very accurate depiction of Chicago too! The chubby kid could have used better development, like have him transfer jobs to the Hoagies shop in the Chi and have some rude customers come in(Typical in Chitown) All in all this film hit me hard in a more dramatic way, than comedic. It was kind of sad to see Kathy Bates and Sh****stick trying to kindle their relationship and let by gones be. Good film, just fell a little short, especially for the cult- classic being the ancestor to this."

Billy Bobs mom (Kathy Bates) is an old swearing tramp stamp whore in one of her worst-best 'Misery' flashback roles.The clueless fat innocent kid from the original is now a stalking clueless twenty year old retarded man-child with a dismal future ahead of him (I worry about him) Insultingly bad and distressful knowing the suicidal drunk & perpetual man-child may be homeless together with Santa Lennie sodomizing self hating women & George watching behind a dumpster.A one star * black-out ,bathhouse hangover."

" Very original comedy
",0.6566,0.9451,2017-06-24 00:00:00,7,This definitely feels like the original. Too bad they didn't meet their budget. I would love to see a Bad Santa 3. I'm still wondering if the real Therman Murman ever has even studied sexual education. He's the best loser I have ever seen. I mean honestly 21 years old and singing in a f(expletive)cking choir. Sh*tstick was classic too. Sh*tstick's mom was great ever since her appearance as Adam Sandler's mother in the Waterboy. Thank god Thurman Merman wasn't laid in the film. Maybe in the next one eh buddy.
" Much funnier, slutty, immoral Santa, but....
",-0.5574,0.998,2017-06-21 00:00:00,6,"Look, I don't why this doesn't deserve more than a six from me. It outsanta's first on laughs, the first couple of minutes had me worried, from the start of that wonderful tracking shot along the paved two way drive in downtown shopping L.A. But then, it becomes so much funnier and punchier, laughs a constant. Thornton, a great actor, seriously, wonderfully resumes his role, where he's more pathetic, and repellent, hitting rock bottom, but still doing what he does and loves best, boozing and womanizing, some more beauties, some I said, not as hot as the ones he did, in the original, and one wonders what happen to Lauren Graham's character, Sue, the barmaid, from the first. He's revisited by an arch enemy, well two, our loud, angry cursing dwarf (Tony Cox) and stepping on board this timer (Kathy Bates) who plays Thornton's loser of a mother who had Willie at 13. Thornton is pulled back into action, this time stooping lower, by putting on the Santa Claus suit again, and creating a diversion, where his partners, rob charity money for homeless kids. The kid has grown up, and like Thornton, is exactly the same, asking dumb questions, talking crap, and still believing about the jolly bearded man in the red suit. The continuing humorous dialogue never slacks at all, where I was laughing much more in this one. One scene where Thornton, snaps at good for nothing Mum, interrupted while eating pizza, familiarizes us with a scene from the first one, where he was interrupted while on his lunch break. The line is almost a clone from the line in the original. The two twists in the end were good, where the final scene, which I made for something else at first, was tasteless and unfunny as this kind of same gag involving genitalia, has been done before. What I really loved about this one, which doesn't have to apologize for nothing (another quality I loved) keeping the happy spirit of Christmas alive, is that the characters haven't changed one bit, especially Thornton's and our new player, (Bates-fantastic) is a real nasty piece of work, where we can see, where Thornton got his beautiful bedside manner from. He has got a bit more of a heart in this one, where he has gone a little soft, where you savor these few moments. His decision of goodwill near the end, teaches us a valuable lesson about greed. But why do I feel this doesn't deserve more than a six? I put it down to it's wearing moments, where you feel, it's better to quit while ahead as with other sequels. It could be cause it's done with the same form, and took, lower below the belt laughs, to make it work. It got to a point where it felt tired, and the wearing was showing. It's as though the movie was relying on gross profanity, or too many moments of familiarity, like structure of story, ""The walls closing in angle"" or scenes, like ""the sitting on Santa's lap"" which was more meatier here, and the greedy people that could jeopardize, Thornton and company's little job. Too, the plots of conflict, and situations, which I thought were well structured. We again, sharing Thornton's familiar vices and habits, which are never changing. This is where the wearing happens, through the familiarity. Also, the substitute of a beauty, by another one, angelic and hotter, being that of Kendricks, so refreshingly cute, spouting those same words like Graham, who gets she gets butt fu..ed by Thornton. All of this highly poses a the question? ""Should there be a Bad Santa 3?"" Of course, not. Why ruin a bad thing? And this Santa, is a good one to finish an end note on, ball sack or not. See if you can spot who Mark Starr is here. cause he fooled me, until I read his cast role."

" The return of the bad Santa!
",-0.5848,0.9817,2017-06-14 00:00:00,6,"I did not expect this sequel, especially not after 13 years. Even the first film has been just a good for me. I won't say it was an unnecessary follow up. They retained main cast, well, only lead two plus the boy who is now in his early 20s. A similar pattern storyline. If you have already seen the previous one, you would know what to expect from it, but not how much and that was the main issue with this. So anyone would predict the scenes, as well as the twist. Like most of the sequels, it indeed weakened. Though somewhat enjoyable for the good performances.R rated comedy. That's another advantage for the grownup audience. But if you aren't a fan of that thematic, then it is even worse than what it's rated everywhere. The length was good, a simple plot, yet the characters had not seriously developed, particularly the new ones. The big excuse was it is a comedy film. They all just came in and straight away displayed whatever they were up to as if we knew them very well. Despite an average film, it can be watched once, even if you liked or not the first part. And it is mainly because of Billy Bob Thornton.6/10"

The only reason this movie gets 2 stars an not one, is because of Christina Hendricks, who looks to be the only actor in the movie who does not phone in her time on screen. Looking like a beautiful flower and trying her best among a pile of dig crap I cannot help but feel bad for her. She probably signed up as a fan of the original thinking there would be something redeeming or funny in Bad Santa 2. There isn't. I hope Brett Kelly has a decent agent who got him a nice fat paycheck for taking part in this.The same can be said for Kathy Bates, who is equally awful as the returning Billy Bob Thornton and Tony Cox. Bates is pretty much bullet proof at this point but she is a LONG way from anything noteworthy here. This is a stain on everyone associated with its career. The insult dialogue between Marcus and Willie, once hysterically funny in the original is completely humorless this time. The movie is horrible from start to finish and not just because of the absence of Lauren Graham, who's ""scheduling conflicts"" did her a massive favor getting her out of this mess. This is also true of the late Bernie Mac and John Ritter who if they could see this movie would be glad they are not on Earth any more because they probably would have been in it as well if they were here. It is so bad it will make you angry if you are a fan of the original."
" Ho-Humbug.
",0.0,0.9953,2017-04-14 00:00:00,5,"Much like an underwhelming Christmas gift that you feign gratitude for, so is ""Bad Santa 2."" The belated sequel to 2003's surprisingly great (and now bonafide classic) dark-horse black comedy brings most of its priniciple cast back for another round of boozing and belittling but with none of the creative team that made the original film in tow. No Terry Zwigoff, no Coen Brothers (which is to say nothing of the truly depressing absence of the late John Ritter and Bernie Mac). Instead, the 13-years-later sequel is offered up by director Mark Waters (""Mean Girls"") and writers Johnny Rosenthal and Shauna Cross (""Whip It""). The results are, as you'd expect, a mixed bag.Billy Bob Thornton slips into one of his most iconic roles as Willie (aka Bad Santa) so easily, you have to wonder if he's even acting at this point. Reunited with his elf-nemesis (Tony Cox) and his estranged, white-trash mother (Kathy Bates), he half-halfheartedly participates in a plan to rip off a charity. Hot on his trail is Thurman Merman (a full-grown and surprisingly wonderful Brett Kelly), the one person in the world who never stopped believing in Willie, much to his own detriment. Standing in for Lauren Graham's character from the first is Christina Hendricks as the head of the charity in question. Hendricks and Thornton have a few embers of chemistry between them, and a little Christina Hendricks goes a long way in making everything better, but both are given virtually nothing to work with. Likewise, everyone here seems to be going through the motions, waiting to cash their paycheck. Ultimately, Brett Kelly's dumpy yet good-natured character ends up shining the brightest. More time spent with the film's dimmest character would have ironically made the film more interesting. There are a few tepid chuckles to be had throughout, but nothing that will stick in your head quite like the material found in the original. The writers try to one-up the original and miss the mark more often than not. Overall, the film ends before it really wears out its welcome, which is probably its biggest selling point. It's crass, excessive and pretty much unnecessary, much like the increasingly cynical holiday season it reflects. Worth watching at least once, but it likely won't worm its way into the regular holiday rotation like its much superior predecessor."

I don't know about you but I didn't find it funny at all.Other than that, Bad Santa 2 was just as hilarious as the 1st.After all the bad reviews I read for it, I wasn't expecting to like this movie at all but I did.It's almost the same as the 1st with Willie & Marcus back together again, Thurman Merman returns as well, Willie's mother is involved now, You know there's going to be a double cross or 2 & there's a ton of rude, lewd, crude humor so if you're not into that sort of thing then Bad Santa 2 isn't for you.I'm pretty sure I only saw the regular version so I can't wait to get a look at the unrated edition.This movie would have been perfect if not for the scene of Willie punching his mother in the face.If they would have cut the punch out then this movie would've been great & I would've given it a higher rating.I hope there will be a part 3 in the near future & we won't have to wait as long as we did for the sequel"
" Bad Santa 2
",-0.5423,-0.9272,2017-04-02 00:00:00,3,"It seems Hollywood is intent on making pointless remakes and sequels to movies that in way require them. The days of stand alone movies appear to be gone as literally anything can get a sequel no matter what. It doesn't even matter how the original movie ended, they will still try to wangle something out of it. Case in point, 2003 black comedy 'Bad Santa', a devilishly wicked little affair that was somewhat original and gave adults something to giggle over after the kids had gone to bed. Did this movie need a sequel? No, it was a clear stand alone movie, plain and simple, yet here we are.Believe it or not but the plot to this movie once again revolves around our protagonist Willie Soke (Billy Bob Thornton) getting into a Santa outfit, the hell you say. Believe it or not but the plot also requires Willie's old partner in crime, Marcus Skidmore (Tony Cox), to also once again join him as an elf so they can pull off a heist. Said heist simply revolves around trying to rob a charity organisation in Chicago. The only major difference with this movie is they have Willie's mother Sunny (Kathy Bates) to help them.So Willie and Marcus are going to attempt to steal all the loot from within the office of this charity organisation. Obviously in order to get into this office they are gonna need to scout around, get the lay of the land and eventually break in somehow. So what does that mean? why lots and lots of profanity, sexual acts and the usual double crossing of course. Seriously this movie has clearly gone all out to simply be more outrageous and disgusting than the original...for no real reason it seems. I don't have an issue with this if it actually made any real sense to the plot. Take Willie for instance, an alcoholic, malnourished, dirty bum with nothing to his name, yet he still manages to get handjobs from busty blondes and sex from the sexy female charity organiser (the one he's trying to steal from). Like I realise this is a dumb comedy but come on now, why would these women be attracted to this guy when he's made out to be so disgusting.Then you have Marcus, who virtually does nothing for the entire run time other than swear and look sorry for himself. Its bloody obvious this guy is still mad at Willie from the first movie and its bloody obvious he's gonna try and screw Willie over. But this guy has nothing to do here, he's merely there for size and sexual innuendo gags. OK sure he was doing the same sh*t in the first movie but that was the first movie. In fact I felt sorry for the guy because this time he gets turned down by a curvy lady who ends up f*cking Willie! (apparently this guy is some kind of low life, homeless sexual magnet). Thurman Merman is back again too (couldn't leave this guy out) although I don't know why. Much like Marcus he does nothing for the run time (even less than Marcus), he only seems to be here again to offer redemption for Willie's character right at the end.The best thing about this movie has to be Kathy Bates as Willie's old mum Sunny. Now even though this characters inclusion is utterly groan inducing in its lack or originality, predictability and tired old clichés, I can't deny it worked to a degree. Bates fits into this role like a glove, she looks like pure overweight white trash and then some. On the other hand, when she cleans and dresses up to play Santa's wife with Willie for a gig, she looks absolutely perfect for that too. The perfect white haired old granny and the perfect leather clad biker bitch from hell! Bates is clearly having a ball letting loose here and she almost saves the film, if it wasn't for the fact that her character is so damn obvious.'I smoked two packs of menthol a day, washed it down with a layer of this gin, and I could still fill this shot glass with this man's j*zz'This movie is desperately short on plot and way too high on filth, its almost as if they were doing it for shock value. It wouldn't be so bad if any of it were actually amusing but most of it is either outright disgusting or plain childish. Everything and anything you could possibly imagine being seedy is in this movie, having anal sex in a dark dirty alley, your mother talking about all kinds of sexual stuff, masturbation, seeing people on the toilet, slutty girls, drunken brawls, being generally rude about fat people, casual racism, misogyny etc...Even the parts where the plot kicks into gear its incredibly stupid. Like how did they rob that mansion without ever being spotted? And could the finale be anymore flippin' predictable!!All in all this was a major miscalculation if you ask me. Yes its kinda amusing to see a drunk dishevelled Billy Bob Thornton in a Santa outfit giving little kids the beady-eye and a mouthful as they take turns sitting on his knee (easily the best part), but that's literally it. Sure its kinda amusing to see Kathy Bates acting like a cock hungry slut, swearing like a sailor whilst looking like a butch dyke, but it wears thin after the initial laughs. I won't lie and say the sex scenes didn't arouse me slightly (some good fantasy scenes in there). But I also can't deny that in the end this movie did leave me actually feeling dirty, like I needed to have a shower. A case of trying to milk the last drop of money out of a franchise? Or simply giving Thornton some much needed work? Probably both.'Flouting? I never sucked j*zz out of nobody's ass!'3.5/10"
" Really, really, funny
",0.5379,0.9909,2017-03-28 00:00:00,10,"This is every bit as good as the first, if not better. If the humor is crude, then it is at least its high quality low brow, if there could be such a thing. The brow is so low that it would be found at the magnetic core of the earth. Even on the streets, which I was pretty close to at a low point in my life, it wasn't this bad. But the humor inserted in these kinds of stark circumstances, is seamless, as only the best comedy writing and talent can show. Tony Cox delivers as he did before, as the dwarf criminal. Who would think that Kathy Bates, an Academy Award winner, would lower herself to such a role? We can only be glad that she did, because she fits like a glove with the other two, and practically steals this movie. I think it was John Barrymore who said on his deathbed, that he might be dying, but at least he wasn't doing comedy. Very few actors can do both high drama and high comedy. Bates proves that she is one of the very few that can do both. Sadly, roles as usual, are very few for older actresses. We don't see enough of her in the cinema these days. Billy Bob, as one of the best of the contemporary actors, also makes that smooth transition, as he has before. This comedy is definitely worth the watch, on too many levels to count, right down to the last scene."

Well then, you have seen Bad Santa 2.Synopsis: Fueled by cheap whiskey, greed and hatred, Willie teams up once again with his angry little sidekick, Marcus, to knock off a Chicago charity on Christmas Eve. Starring: Billy Bob Thornton, Kathy Bates, Tony Cox Director: Mark WatersWhat I said above I was serious about. There is no difference between the first and second movie. The heist is just a bit different.That's not to say the movie wasn't at all funny, because it really was for the first hour. Then the last third was serious like the first movie. I'm kind of glad I didn't go see this movie in the theaters now.It is a buyable movie if you have the first one.Rating: 6 out of 10"
" Definitely missing Bernie Mac and John Ritter
",0.128,-0.0701,2017-03-02 00:00:00,10,"But it's almost as funny as the first one, this sequel has the same quirky characters the first one had, parodies of real people types, sometimes believable. That's why I enjoy these so much. Especially Mike Starr as ""Pedo Santa"".Thurman Murman returns, exactly the same as he was before, except now 21. Kathy Bates joins Willie Soke and Marcus Skidmore to do ""One Last Job"". But as the details unfold, we see it's a job that Willie is not too comfortable with, even with his low standards.But it's a showcase for all kinds of new inanity. And although not near as great as the original, there are still some very good Billy Bob moments, as he fornicates, drinks and stumbles through one more Christmas. His final revenge on Marcus is classic.Of course, the outcome of the ""Job"" was too predictable, but to have any other outcome would not have been realistic, at least for Willie and Marcus. It's a 3-way ""cock-up"" this time."

",0.4848,0.945,2017-02-28 00:00:00,6,"If you liked the first then you will likely be disappointed by this film. If you're like me and you love the Trailer Park Boy's drunk type humor, then check this film out! I had a few drinks and watched it with my friend and we were laughing hysterically at some parts. I tend to rate movies either 1 above or below the average IMDb rating unless it really impresses me/sucks."
" Great black comedy
",0.765,0.9761,2017-02-26 00:00:00,8,"I really loved this movie, I thought it was well written, and continued in the direction of the original movie. Be ready for a lot of dirty jokes, hilarious one-liners, and a ton of swearing! Kathy Bates is brilliant in it as Thornton's mother. I laughed to much during the movie and I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed to original film!"
" Basically a remake of the original but I did laugh quite a bit. Not as good as the first one at all but worth seeing.
",0.6995,0.9951,2017-02-25 00:00:00,6,"""It's starting to feel like Christmas."" Willie Soke (Thornton) has been living a whiskey filled existence since the double cross he experienced during Christmas a few years ago. When his old partner shows up and wants him to get back into the game he agrees because he's Willie. After realizing that their new partner is his mother (Bates) he second guesses the entire thing, but the chance of stealing millions changes his mind. Everything is going to plan, until Thurman shows up. This is a movie that I changed my opinion on after watching the special features, which never happens. While watching it I did laugh, but it was basically the exact same movie as the first one. No twists were surprising and even most of the jokes were reused. I loved the first one and did enjoy this but kept thinking, this is just another sequel that seemed to be made to make money off a name and that's it. While watching the features Billy Bob said that this is a movie made for fans of the original. He said the movie was made with them in mind and if they get new fans that's great but it wasn't the goal of the film. After hearing that context I have to think the movie did what it set out to do. That being said, if you liked the first one you will like this as well, nothing new but just a funny movie with heart that is worth your time. Overall, basically a remake of the original, but I did laugh quite a bit. Not as good as the first one at all but worth seeing if you are a fan of the first one. I give this a B-."
" Cringe Inducing
",0.0,0.2382,2017-02-25 00:00:00,2,"It will come as a shock to very few people that this film is extremely crass and vulgar, with about as lame a plot as one can imagine. Obviously, it's meant to be the darkest of comedy, but comedy usually means to me actually laughing at something but this movie is so bleak and intent on shocking that the effect was just cringe inducing and a real turnoff. I'm aware that the film will have its proponents, so more power to you but I can't subscribe or buy in to this mean-spirited crapola.All in all, this sequel, directed by Mark Waters with a screenplay from Johnny Rosenthal and Shauna Cross, did nothing for me and the end couldn't come soon enough."
" Boring and a waste of time!!!
",-0.7163,0.293,2017-02-24 00:00:00,3,"Willie Soke (Billy Bob Thornton) is at it again with his perverted, alcoholic, and stealing habits back in the santa suit for the holidays. The first film was decent, and had some raunchy outtakes that made it entertaining. Although, Bad Santa 2 fails in trying to surprise us with new humor. It has its sexual raunchy humor, maybe some race jokes, and plenty of stupid humor. It does not work the second time around unlike some movies. The plot follows Willie traveling to Chicago with Marcus (Tony Cox) to steal from a charity group. That is trying to raise donations for the children. Sure, the plot is not exactly a friendly theme about thieves using the santa suit to con people. Even the humor may have some gags but can be overdone and boring. Even, they bring in Willie's deadbeat mother in played by Kathy Bates. The jokes and sexual humor are only fun for a moment until its just pure stupid. That the film is not worth mentioning after it is over. I love that they bring back the original cast like Billy Bob Thornton, Tony Cox, and Brett Kelly as Thurman. Thurman is the idiot now grown teen that has no where to go but obsessed and follows Willie around. The script does not try to do anything new that the first movie succeeded in. It tries to redo the same jokes over again. Some highlights with Christina Hendricks making an appearance as a sponsor to this charity group and also an addicted that may be Willie's counter half with the sex addiction. Bad Santa 2 is just horrible when it comes to boring plot, annoying humor, and redundant concept like the first movie. Overall, I would rate it 1.5 out of 5."
" Funniest Movie I've seen this year
",0.5574,0.8311,2017-02-23 00:00:00,10,I wasn't expecting much going off other people's reviews saying it was not good. This sequel is hilarious I was laughing pretty much the whole movie it's just as good as the 1st movie. Just as crude and inappropriate definitely worth watching it's the funniest movie I've seen this year
" A Barrel of laughs up until the kid shows up.
",0.4939,0.9773,2017-02-15 00:00:00,9,"I laughed so hard the first hour, I nearly started crying. The banter back and forth between the 3 of them is really funny. The heavy drinking gets a bit over the top in some scenes, I know it's sort of a trademark for the movies main character,but I felt they used it in lack of story development.Katy bates is excellent as Billy Bobs jail bird mum.Mean and nasty,and cussing like a sailor. The midget does his job to perfection by often being the butt end of all the midget jokes they can come up with.Yet he gives as good as he gets,without coming up for air.Now the kid, on the other hand...He should've been left back in Vegas. OR wherever it is they start out from. He ruins the dynamic in the trio. He was okay in the beginning,since he was billy's link to the first movie. But when they continue to use his meaningless character onward in the story,it drops a good couple of notches. He just ain't funny.Rather very annoying since he break the dynamic. So I shave off a point for that,and give the movie 9 stars.I feel the relationship between the head of security and his boss, could have been done better,it left a lot of room for funny situations that wasn't exploited"
" Raunchy humor that would make Lenny Bruce blush
",0.2732,-0.6004,2017-02-10 00:00:00,7,"""Bad Santa 2"" is frequently hilarious, if one enjoys raunchy no-holds-barred humor. In a world of oppressive mandates for politically correct action, speech and thought, it is a breath of fresh air, mercilessly lampooning every liberal sacred cow imaginable. It is not a great film. ""Bad Santa"" was amusing, but not particularly memorable and the sequel will undoubtedly also quickly fade from memory. The plot is largely familiar. The characters don't grow emotionally and are roughly as misanthropic, misogynistic, cynical, self-destructive, abrasive, etc., at the conclusion as they were at the start. It succeeds in creating humor by placing ridiculous characters in improbable circumstances. The humor is bawdy, uninhibited and confrontational. The jokes would make Lenny Bruce blush. The film fails to rise above its station in its use of alcohol and nudity. Alcohol can be used for burlesque effect by turning a normally staid individual into a stumbling clown, or it can be used to strip away the character's inhibitions, exposing raw anger, resentment, fear and other emotions for all to see, as in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" Nudity can be used for titillation, or make the character seem vulnerable, primal or honest, as in ""Teachers."" BS2 uses uninhibited, unrestrained, brutally honest language to convey the frustrations, anger and other emotions of the characters. It is at times shocking or amusing, but consistently honest. But alcohol does not strip away any emotions or public façades, as these characters have no inhibitions to strip away. The brief nudity seems immature and puerile compared with the dialogue. One character has on-camera sex in half a dozen scenes with several different partners, with both partners fully dressed (at least from the camera's POV). This is an actor known for a highly erotic scene in a 2001 film. What little nudity is presented in the film seems cheesy and dishonest compared with the brutally honest dialogue. The film delivers more laughs than many comedies. Production values are adequate. Performances are uniformly excellent. The script is underdeveloped with several major plot holes. It isn't destined to become a classic, but succeeds admirably as a raunchy celebration of political incorrectness."
" This Time Out It's Truly...Bad (as in awful)
",0.0,-0.2076,2017-01-25 00:00:00,4,"Bad Santa was a concept that worked because it it had a perfect cast for an original slant on Santa. You can get the principal cast back, and even add Kathy Bates as Bad Santa's equally depraved mom, but the originality is gone as is the shock value. In some ways you feel the writers knew this and tried hard for some new verbal humor aiming really low. Sure there's some laughs, but it can't make up for the fact that there's a big ""been there, done that"" thing hovering over the movie. Note to Kristina Hendricks: this will not advance your career and it's a step back for Billy Bob Thornton too simply because Bad Santa 2 is truly bad."
" Seriously Awful!
",-0.6114,0.9617,2017-01-21 00:00:00,1,"Loved the first film which is what led me to watch the 2nd, but wow, honestly, what a sh*t heap this film was. Just another movie that really didn't need a sequel, no idea why they felt the need to try and make one after 13 years.
The plot is terrible, there's only a couple of laughs at most, and this one just seemed a lot more ""amateur hour"" than the first one.It's a real shame because there are some good actors in this film, but not even Kathy Bates could save this poorly written piece of you know what! The cast obviously saw it as a money making opportunity and nothing more.Don't waste your time, just forget this film ever existed and go watch the first film again!"
