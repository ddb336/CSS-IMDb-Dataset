" Dreadful!
",-0.4926,-0.933,2021-04-01 00:00:00,1,"Not worth one star. Made in a style virtually the same as Blair Witch. Very poor characters, none of which I managed to have any rapoor, in fact they were all extremely irritating human beings. As surrutiouse invaders of a government facility, they were probably the most noisy I've ever heard or seen. Dreadful film!"
" Terrible
",-0.4767,-0.9168,2021-02-22 00:00:00,1,"I started watching, and quickly got irritated with the hormonal teenage antics. I thought it would get better, it got worse. Due to the trailer I was sure it would soon get better, maybe it was good in the bit when I dozed off, but I will never know, as I won't be watching again. Bad acting, bad filming, dialogue often indecipherable, unbelievable, just bad!"
" It's all about the Grays
",0.0,0.7783,2021-02-19 00:00:00,9,"In terms of cinematography it's not gonna announce for Oscar or any festival prizes, but in terms of telling facts that people wetness early in their ages it does that with simply way which make it so connected because it's just a guys adventure.... This film has lower rate because people still don't believe there is some other creatures living with us in this flat earth and government in different country deal with them secretly this simple adventure tells that in interesting film"
" Garbage
",0.0,0.5423,2021-02-01 00:00:00,1,It's just the sheer arrogance that anyone thought this formulaic garbage was good enough that people spend their hard earned money on. Of course as I've never been involved in film making it's easy to judge...... it's also fun. I hope the producers hate themselves.
" One and a half hour of pure comedy gold
",0.3612,0.8859,2020-12-10 00:00:00,1,"Okey the whole film wasn't funny, so you can skip the first hour but after that it just gets funnier and funnier. I loved the part when they all died. Hilarious."
" No comments

" Drags a bit, but improves as it goes along
",0.5187,0.8745,2020-09-22 00:00:00,7,"Three young conspiracy theorists stumble into much more than they bargained for when they devise a bold plan to break into the legendary government base Area 51 to find out if rumors about alien life on said base are indeed true. While director/co-writer Oren Peli takes a tad too long to set the basic premise up and the opening third feels more than a tad padded, Peli nonetheless still manages to generate a considerable amount of nerve-wracking tension and thrilling excitement once our obsessed and determined protagonists break into the base and find themselves in considerable jeopardy. The briefly glimpsed extraterrestrial creatures are genuinely creepy and convincing. The acting by the game no-name cast is solid and persuasive. Nice chillingly grim ending, too. By no means a perfect movie, but overall a solid and effective little sci-fi/horror thriller."
" Found footage alien romp
",0.0,0.9922,2020-07-22 00:00:00,5,"A grouplet of three twenty-somethings sneaks into Area 51 with all this gadgetry that HAS to exceed their credit card limits! First the central character gets zapped or transfixed or some such at a party that happens to be near Area 51 - the 51st state. As a result he becomes obsessed and convinces one of his two best buds to break into Area 51 with him. The other won't go but agrees to drive them there and wait for them while they go on they adventure. Also a girl comes along for reasons that make her important enough to do so. This flick is kinda great for the FF fanatic, which is me. It's fun to watch the outlandish plans be made and then later unfold. FF always, if well done, has an air of unsettled tension. It's like a layer of safety has been removed. That's the situation once they get into the Area. It's like the men who chase them are the safety and if you run away from them you have removed a layer of safety. For instance they never would have gotten into the tots scary underground catacomb-like place. They never would have unleashed the alien who chases down Darrin in the Jurassic Park cafeteria scene. Which wasn't half bad."
" Omg please

" Area 51
",0.0,0.2144,2020-06-24 00:00:00,5,"Considering the topic it should be interesting. But when you keep the audience on tenterhooks, and you don't show anything, you are letting. And the getting caught breachin a government facility."
" Unrated
",0.0,0.7939,2020-06-06 00:00:00,7,I actually thought this was a really interesting and good ending found footage film. I would day this and Apollo 18 are unrated and worth watching.
" underated
",0.0,0.9551,2020-06-06 00:00:00,10,"Top 10 found footage movie for sure! good acting, good effects, area 51 looks amazing, this is the best alien found footage movie in my opinion!"
" Not a scary film, but I don't think it's supposed to be
",0.2057,0.93,2020-05-29 00:00:00,8,"I believe this movie has been mis-labeled. It is by no means a ""horror"" film. It is, however, better classified as a ""sci-fi thriller"".I enjoy the found-footage genre, for the most part. When it's done correctly, which this film is. Everything that's filmed makes sense given the context. Quite a few times, my adrenaline was up while watching and I was genuinely concerned about the main characters.That's one of the things I liked about this film was the character development. Unlike a lot of thrillers, where the characters are hackneyed and cliched, these characters were actually written like people and you can genuinely understand where they're all coming from.So I do recommend this movie, just not as a horror flick."
" Boring found footage
",-0.3182,-0.8442,2020-05-07 00:00:00,1,"This movie is a complete waste of time. Its a found footage movie, and its a total waste of time. For more than 3/4 of the movie, you just follow these guys while they are on their way to Area 51. And nothing happens. Nothing, zip zilch.
And the last quarter of the movie, is just screaming and confusing.
I rather watch paint dry on a wall."
" The death of a genre
",-0.5994,0.0644,2020-04-07 00:00:00,3,"If Blair Witch was the birth of the shaky camera/reality, horror genre; then Area 51, must surely be the death of it. One amusing aspect was the ease in which the over excited troop gained access to Area 51, which then returned to the usual boredom of nothing. Because nothing happens. Until about ten minutes until then end, but you've well and truly lost any interest you may have had for the rather two dimensional characters. Some films are good because they are bad, while others are just bad."
" Awful, just awful
",-0.7184,-0.9834,2020-04-07 00:00:00,1,"This is what happens when you let the 12 year olds in the drama club make a 'film' using mobile phones. This found footage thing didn't impress me with Blair Witch, it seems to have set a really low standard for anyone who fancies being an actor/director/writer. Badly shot poorly lit heavy breathing scenes with poorly executed jump scares featuring out of focus 'dad with a grey bed sheet over him' don't achieve the jump or the scare. So disappointed that this waste featured in the so bad it's bad section of Kermode and Mayo's Friday film reviews."
" Waste of time
",-0.4215,-0.2823,2020-04-01 00:00:00,2,"After watching the trailer I thought this movie will be pretty good. I was wrong. Please avoid this movie, it's just a waste of time. It has few exciting parts, but the story has not been explained properly. I am really confused about the ending.
2/10"
" It's entertaining...
",0.0,0.8316,2020-03-31 00:00:00,5,"If you enjoy ""The Blair Witch Project"" this one will add something to the ""found footage"" genre :) I liked it, although I am sure that I watched it only because of the quarantine."
" Needs a sequel.
",0.0,0.8313,2020-03-19 00:00:00,10,This was one of the Best films in this genre. I really enjoyed it.
" Average Alien Found Footage
",0.0,0.8689,2020-03-15 00:00:00,5,"There is no way these characters would want to do what they did and there is no way they could do what they did. That said, let's say four idiots with GoPros break into Area 51, release Aliens and run around. It is original and well acted. It has some great sets and effects. I wish the characters were likable and I wish the writers had spent more time developing a story that made sense."
" Interesting premise - Terrible by the final act
",-0.1027,0.3021,2020-02-26 00:00:00,3,"I remember putting Area 51 on Netflix one day because I was bored and even though it's silly, I like the set up and the idea of how they get in to Area 51. However once the film actually gets going, there is cliché after cliché with a ending that was really quite crap. If you don't take it seriously (which is probably what they intended because it does get rather silly), you'll have fun - especially when if you're drunk with your friends and need a bad movie. But if you're sober, don't bother."
" Greatly underrated
",0.0,0.3174,2020-02-17 00:00:00,7,"The way this movie starts off with the sort of frat boy vibe to it, I didn't have much of an expectation. I found myself riveted to the tv about half way in and it was definitely worth it. It's a suspenseful ride and considering lower budgeted I was very surprised. It's not the movie of 2015 but seeing some of the other reviews it's a testimony for me that consensus is not always in line with ones taste."
" Below average found footage
",0.0,-0.0644,2020-02-11 00:00:00,2,"One of plenty found footage movies that don't even try to be creative with its subject.The film maker could go absolutely wild with this Area 51 conspiracy flick but for some reason decided to stick to ""safe"" cliché depiction of what's inside the base.The ""big reveal"" at the end is laughably poor and makes you regret sitting throw the mediocre acting and story telling.Also movie raises so many basic questions like - why were there no security cameras inside this top secret lab/base, what those ppl would do with the video after getting out (since their faces/names are all over it."
" Oren Peli does know how to create suspension.
",0.2732,0.4939,2020-02-02 00:00:00,6,"A huge fan of Paranormal Activity and even though Area 51 comes nowhere close to that masterpiece among ""Found footage""-genre, I still enjoyed it.
Would've probably given it a higher rating if the movie wouldn't have felt as if it was somehow missing an interlude. As if it skipped to the ending shortly after the prologue was over.
But still. It was still a fairly good sci-fi horror."
" Bad movie with some cool elements.
",-0.296,-0.3579,2019-12-30 00:00:00,5,"Just to sum it up immediately, it is not a good movie. Typical ""found-footage""-type movie. But what I liked about it was that the approach towards the Area 51 was filmed on the actual route to Rachel and ahead from there. The stuff that will happen once the group is inside the so-called Area 51, is quite boring and not that well made. But the first part of the movie is well worth watching, especially if you have been in Rachel."
" Cool budget film
",0.3182,0.4033,2019-12-29 00:00:00,6,The film was a cut above the rest of the usual hand held found footage horror films. The Area 51 itself was interesting and they had some cool special FX. The downside is the camera shaking all the time which makes it very annoying to watch. Beside that I enjoyed it.
" Beam me up
",0.0,-0.7096,2019-12-29 00:00:00,1,"A truly awful movie. It's boring and long, nothing happens. Frankly, it's just bad."
" Is that it?
",0.0,0.5034,2019-12-22 00:00:00,1,"Seriously? Is that it? Really? Ok, this guy has never set foot on any military base anywhere ever. The sheer mundanity of these places you can't set foot anywhere without being noticed, anytjing out if place stands out like a sore thumb. Throw in young adults crashing and thrashing about the place like a humpback whale in crockery shop. Why did I watch this to the end? Even within the genre it fell away, ideas set up but not explored. It could be reworked to make a genuinely frightening film with the strong aliens among us myth."
" A solid yet forgettable flick
",0.1531,0.9663,2019-12-08 00:00:00,6,"Straight to the point: it's not great, but it's certainly not bad. Starts rough, but eventually gets better when things start happening.The characters won't hold this film up. But some cool special effects and clever little twists kept me watching."
" Start well but end in terrible way.
",-0.5574,0.0772,2019-11-20 00:00:00,4,"The first part is good, the center part is bad, the end part is terrible. If you like UFOs stay away. If you don't like ufos watch some other movie."
" Should be declared Off Limits.
",0.0,0.3668,2019-09-13 00:00:00,4,"In this 'found-footage' movie in the vein of Blair Witch, four teens come a serious cropper when they decide to venture into Area 51 on a hunt for alien life.But not as unlucky as the audience members unfortunate enough to stumble upon this mess, which takes an age to get to its destination with pointless stops at a party, strip club and various motels along the way. Also, chatter. Lots and lots of trivial chatter. Zzzzz.Even when we do reach the alleged extraterrestrial hotbed (which is FAR too easy to break into, btw) things proceed at a snail's pace, with only the last ten minutes providing anything by way of excitement. By then, it's already too late, and you'll probably wish to be sucked up into the sky like our unlucky protagonists long before the credits roll.No, for a movie with a meagre 5 million dollar budget, I don't expect perfection. What I do want however, is a few thrills, chills and the feeling this is all actually happening.When everything mostly feels dull and fake (climax aside) I think I'm entitled to feel a bit gipped. Many exciting horror films have been made on a shoestring, with tons more excitement and professionalism on offer. It can be done, guys. So try. 4/10"
" Area 4.5
",0.0,-0.1615,2019-09-08 00:00:00,5,"Quite disappointing, was expecting much more. Too much time dedicated to presenting the characters - that are as tedious at the 50-minute mark as they are at the beginning of the movie - compared to the actual action that only gets slightly interesting in the second part of the last act. Guys, dark corridors and empty rooms are creepy, ok, but enough is enough! A note: IMDb doesn't currently allow users to rate movies using tenths so I must clarify: my displayed rating of 5 is actually a rounder 4.5"
" Not realistic as I expected
",0.0,0.4458,2019-09-08 00:00:00,6,"CONTAIN SPOILER. It's ok for a sunday afternoon movie. I enjoyed it as a mystery/thriller and it has some high points. The only thing I missed, and therefore I don't like it that much, AND THIS IS A MAIN SPOILER, is that the inside of the area 51 is completely empty. How am I supposed to believe that there is nobody working there?? The entire half an hour at the end, the main characters are running through the base facing no guards, where are they? It's supposed to be the most secured military base in the US and there's literally empty! Please."
" Blair Witch Meets the Aliens - Area 51 - MST 3000 Fodder
",-0.3612,-0.8022,2019-09-06 00:00:00,1,"MST 3000 always needs new fodder for its really bad turkeys, and this film? is really qualified for the Turkey Farm. Unintentionally hilarious. I was waiting for Joe Flaherty from Second City Television to come on the screen halfway through and say ""That was a really scary one, eh kids?"" Not. Hopefully Oren Peli can find another line of work."
" Better than Expected
",0.4404,0.979,2019-09-04 00:00:00,7,"If you're seeing this film and expecting something spectacular like Casablanca or Citizen Kane, that's not going to happen. This film isn't meant to be great, but made for those who like something a bit scary. It really isn't too bad of a film once it gets going.It starts out slow and stumbles a bit, that's true, but in the second half it picks up. It gets interesting once the characters are inside Area 51. From there, it's hard to look away, not knowing what to expect. It was definitely different, but not great and not terrible either."

" Utter Cr%&
",0.0,-0.8803,2019-02-04 00:00:00,1,"OMG how bad is this film, its like its been put in a shredder and randomly glued back together again, the film jumps the dialogue too, it is totally awful awful film. All I can say is this is like a film students first effort and randomly shoots everything this is by far the worst film ever made utter garbage"
" Typical found footage...
",0.0,0.5648,2019-02-02 00:00:00,4,"AREA 51 is a typical kind of found footage movie, watchable enough but not offering anything up that hasn't been done a million times before. A bunch of kids decide to head off and infiltrate Area 51 to find out if they can uncover evidence of extraterrestrial life, but of course there are the usual surprises in store for them. Much of the running time smacks of padding and there's only real substance at the climax, but even then it feels like a sci-fi focused BLAIR WITCH re-run."
" If that's what Area 51 is, we are screwed
",-0.4939,-0.7394,2019-01-04 00:00:00,6,A little too extravaggant on many issues. Hyperbole one many issues (what/how/where in sci fi and science) and not enough visuals to explain it. Not enough for effective horror.
" DEADLY FORCE IS AUTHORIZED
",0.0,-0.3071,2018-11-01 00:00:00,4,"Three guys plus a woman conspire to break into Area 51 and learn its secrets. The secret US test base for experimental aircraft? Nope. That other Area 51 with all those alien secrets. Filmed in Nevada, the film spends the first hour attempting to make us believe these High Tech Macgyvers can pull it off. Then the rest of the film attempts to be interesting, but fails, thinking throwing a few decent special effects at us will compensate for a boring first hour and haphazard ending.My advice is to fast forward through the first hour, so you won't be out of steam when it starts to get decent.Guide: F-bomb and nudity"
" A poor attempt at film making...
",-0.4767,0.9153,2018-10-02 00:00:00,2,"You would think that young film makers want to be noticed...so they would try very hard to create something memorable...The only thing memorable about this movie, is the realization that these kids thought shakycam is super duper...This is a one camera (cell phone???) adventure, that bounces your eyeballs from start to finish, trying to watch it...and that is it !! Nothing more, no script, most of the time a single flashlight for lighting...and, of course, that shaky view that makes you wonder, ""Where's the story, where's the movie...""I surprised myself by actually giving this a 2 star rating..."
" Worst film
",-0.6249,-0.9072,2018-09-02 00:00:00,2,I dont know why this film is made. Idea is good but filming is worst. Cam not still for a second. Worst film i ever see.
" Really Disappointing
",-0.5413,0.1779,2018-07-06 00:00:00,4,I expected so much more from an Oren Peli film. Missed the mark and what could have been a much better film.
" Interesting till the end
",0.4019,0.6306,2018-06-12 00:00:00,8,"The Movie is very interesting to me as I am interested in the Subject described in its Name. I think, those who are interested in the same Thing, will find this Movie good and positive. Of course, I can not say that the Film is 100% realistic, but at least it tries to be as realistic as it is possible for the Movie. The ""Atmosphere"" of the Action keeps you intrigued till the End. Not to make a Spoiler I can say only that the final Scenes of the Movie were not as I expected them to be. P. S. There is still no Movie (in the Humans' Cinema of the Year 2018) where I could find the Process of close Communications with extra terrestrial Humanoids which some of us have experienced or wished to experience. The closest I could find is the 'Arrival' Film of the Year 2016."
" A wasted opportunity to bring the interesting idea alive
",0.5994,-0.5329,2018-04-13 00:00:00,3,"Area 51: Directed by Oren Peli and written by Christopher Denham and Oren PeliI have to just lay this out there for folks right off the bat. I can not stand found footage movies. That shaky cam and trying to make things realistic to make people believe that what is happening is real really make me nauseous. I get severe motion sickness from watching this type of cinema. I decided to forgoe my distaste for found footage movies because I found the idea behind this movie to be interesting. Three friends decide to sneak into Area 51 and document what they find there. Every person who is interested in aliens and UFOs know all about Area 51 and everyone wants to know what is going on there. I'm no different. I went out there to Rachel, Nevada to visit it. I got a little giddy by watching these places on the screen again. I enjoy it and I'm intrigued by it. I still have this nagging feeling though that this movie had no need to be found footage. It could have been a standard narrative and achieved far more success. When they make it into the base and the camera is still going wild, I had a difficult time determining what was happening. I wanted to know some semblance of what was happening. I wanted those moments between the friends and the woman who helps them where we learn about who they were as people. I wanted to know why they were obsessed. We never really learn much about any of them. You also find yourself asking why are they still filming when things go insane. It's the same question people ask when they watch a found footage movie. Making this a standard narrative removes that problem from the story. The ending was also blah. It has that usual bad ending that a lot of these found footage movies have and it was kinda BS. The beginning spoils this ending as well. The performances are pretty meaningless and outside of the interest in UFOs and Area 51, there's nothing to do here. It's scattered and a wasted potential. I hate to see that. I give this movie a D."
" Complete Nonsense
",-0.4019,0.7751,2017-11-04 00:00:00,1,"I wish I wouldn't have wasted my time watching this, as it was nothing but complete nonsense from start to end. In my opinion, you will be dumber for watching it. There's no possible way anything done by the kids in the movie could have been accomplished to penetrate the defenses of the Groom Lake facility, just for starters, let alone getting into buildings or finding what they supposedly found, and the ending... good lord."
" Disgrace to found footage
",-0.4939,0.8299,2017-10-11 00:00:00,1,"Ridiculous film. Had some terrible clichés - mysterious planes shuttling into Vegas without tail numbers?? You may as well print ""top secrety secret plane for secret people"" down the side of the fuselage. The site security pretending to be a tourist given away by the absence of license plates on his car?? Top secrety secret car... it felt like site security was set up by Austin Powers.As they are approaching the base the line ""security should be quite light at this time of night"" was a personal favourite. It turned out to be so light in fact they were able to shout without being heard at certain points as they were galloping around. Appalling acting ending with a spectacular anticlimax."

",0.6476,0.9517,2017-09-27 00:00:00,7,"I didn't know what to expect with this film but it's a really good effort with a gripping story. It follows some fairly standard themes around Area 51 so no surprises there, but it actually delves into more detail than other attempts I've seen in this genre. It was well planned and the ideas (no spoilers!) had been really thought through.The CGI was impressive and the style of filming was unexpected but worked really well with the storyline. This is an entertaining horror film that sits outside of the box. It's definitely worth a watch."

",0.4404,0.8277,2017-09-25 00:00:00,6,"I was entertained. It's not a great movie, but for movie night it's not too bad. Popcorn and laughs makes it better. Don't expect to be scared though, it's not scary. In some places it reminded me of Outlast/Outlast 2 and Blair Witch Project (as in the original) -but sadly with none of the scary factors."

",-0.3818,0.0364,2017-08-26 00:00:00,1,"Tons of crap in the history of man kind. An unconnected themes which was not making sense. This movie even does not deserve 5 minutes of watching. Waste of time and money. Do not know what was writing doing while calling it a horror and thriller. It was so easy to intrude in such a high surveillance area, making so much noise and none is watching. Even the guards arrived and they managed to escape."

Does Area 51 not have security cameras and guards monitoring them 24/7? They were legit sneaking and walking around inside the base and no one notices this until near the end. Like.....I know I said this already, but just stop and think for a second about how stupid this sounds.A government facility, funded by unlimited amounts of money, which holds answers to hard questions we ask every time we look into the sky, has such terrible security that 3 average teens/young adults holding cameras could break into it...........'kayOtherwise, the acting was passable, the special effects were great, and the found footage feel was there, I just couldn't get over how stupid the writing was."
" Way underrated

Maybe people have something against found footage but this was done very well. As fan of the horror genre, I can't recommend this enough, especially if aliens creep you out! All in all its a very well-done movie that deserves a way better rating. Definitely give it a watch if you're looking for a scary movie!"
" Dissatisfying
",-0.5267,-0.9593,2017-03-08 00:00:00,3,Watched this as it was on TV and i couldn't sleep. It was boring apart from when they got inside but then it turned weird at the end Spoiler alertThe ending where they get lifted up is so stupid and over used in most other movies about aliens. Just boring and stupid and confusing but nothing else to watch then sure.
