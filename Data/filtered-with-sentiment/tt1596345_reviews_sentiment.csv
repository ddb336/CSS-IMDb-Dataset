" Good movie, only sort of about chess
",0.4404,0.971,2021-03-11 00:00:00,9,"It's really about a very intelligent man under intense pressures and probably with an undiagnosed mental condition. The fact that Bobby Fischer and his mother were in fact spied on by the FBI didn't help. Also, Nixon and Kissinger really were following the 1972 match, and it really was like a skirmish in the Cold War, and Kissinger did indeed call Bobby.Though, I think the notion that Bobby (or Spassky) were like sacrificed pawns by their governments is rather exaggerated.Bobby certainly seemed to be out there, but a lot of his actions in the 1972 matchup seem to be tactics of a smart man. The ""blunder"" in the first game certainly suggests this.For the movie itself, Tobey does a fine job playing Bobby. It seems the only real complaint about him was that Bobby was really tall, and that may have impacted his opponents psychologically. That may well be true, and Tobey is a lot shorter, but it's impossible to get every nuance right, and it would probably be hard to really convey that.Sarsgaard as Father Lombardy is great, often subtly hilarious. I don't know how well he portrayed the actual Lombardy, but he tended to steal the scenes he was in."
" If you know nothing of chess ...
",0.0,0.6469,2021-02-17 00:00:00,2,"Then you would know that Fischer was not this way during his climatic peak to winning the World Championship. The stress on this movie was on his mannerisms, thought processes and the way he reacted in chess & social interactions.They were greatly exaggerated for the most part. This individual do more for chess to extol it to a higher ground, more $$ and exposure. The players of today thank him for that. To portray him in such a bad light considering when you got to know how he really was was a great contrast to what we see here. If you're looking for a half-truth movie about a chess player then it's your cup of tea but if you're looking for the real Robert Fischer story then move on.Highly recommended is Frank Brady's book, ""Bobby Fischer: Profile of a Prodigy"" or the highly technical,""A Psychobiography of Bobby Fischer"" by Joseph G. Ponterotto Ph.D. who is a licensed psychologist and a Professor of Counseling Psychology in Fordham University's Graduate School of Education, New York City. He currently is Coordinator of Fordham University's Mental Health Counseling Program."
" Good biopic
",0.4404,0.8519,2021-02-13 00:00:00,8,"Pawn Sacrifice gets to dramatize the real-life story of Bobby Fischer (Tobey Maguire), Cold War-era chess prodigy and champion. In a clear attempt at prestige candidacy, the film falls victim to the usual biopic pitfall by relying solely on the events as they played out, as opposed to using them to determine a story worth telling. Maybe a bit too long but certainly worth it"
" Superficial, should have been a lot better...did they not even bother to watch the 2011 documentary? The screenplay was weak...
",0.2584,-0.8416,2021-01-22 00:00:00,6,"Tobey did an OK job, but the script was poor, and why they didn't just use Bobby's actual words as much as possible is beyond me...especially given the amount of it that is recorded...I mean the Dick Cavett bit were they changed the dialogue with the really poor CGI is like a microcosm of what's wrong with this movie...as Spassky himself said ""surrogate/artificial""...also, Tobey just looks wrong for 1972, they could have used him for the 50s to early 60s shots, but needed someone else thereafter. I thought he did a good job of depicting Bobby's paranoia/fear in some scenes though. Someone mentioned Nicolas Cage here, OK if this was the 90s, way too old...Christian Bale would have been better IMO...But, I think once Fincher dropped it they should have pulled the plug. Shame. It has some redeeming features, worth watching once anyway, but the seams really show on the second viewing."
" 6 stars for a great true story told in a pedestrian manner. Still worth checking out.
",0.8316,0.9846,2021-01-08 00:00:00,6,"PAWN SACRIFICE was an interesting movie that told a good story. I was never bored. But I was also never gripped. The story of Bobby Fischer, and in particular, his rise to world champion chess player via an epic competition with Russian Boris Spassky, is amazing. I was too young at the time to have any real memories of it now, but I can only image, at the height of the Cold War, how this battle must have resonated with Americans (and Soviets).But I found the approach to tell us the story was clunky and frustrating. First of all, depicting chess on screen isn't the easiest task (at least trying to make it exciting is)...so the approach the film often uses is to have the characters played by Michael Stuhlberg (Fischer's ""agent"") and Peter Sarsgard (a priest who used to be a chess champion, and is now Fischer's ""sparring partner"") explain to each other, and thus the viewer, what is happening and why it's amazing. We never feel the amazement ourselves...we have to see THEM being amazed and by extenstion try to feel amazed. So, the chess itself is tricky. And then, so is the character of Bobby Fischer. If this were a fiction story, I'd say Fischer's character is unbelievable and immensely unlikable. I guess because it's a true story, I BELIEVE the character, but I dislike him all the more. He a massive egoist with no redeeming qualities. He plays great chess, but he treats EVERYONE around him with disdain or worse. He makes insane demands because he can. He's is also a paranoid, driven by demons that have made him crazy (to be blunt). Frankly, at almost no time do we see the ""human"" in Fischer, the guy we can relate to. He's a terribly unsympathetic character...yet I think we're meant to feel sorry for how the strains for his genius have driven him mad. I just want someone to beat the guy up! Tobey Maquire seems to do a fair job with the role (actually, everyone is perfectly fine), but the script doesn't give him a chance to earn our caring or sympathy. It dwells so heavily on his peculiarities.Also, here's a nitpick. I watched the blu-ray of this film and the detail is so fine, I could readily see the makeup on the actors, Maquire in particular. He looked like a guy smeared with inexpensive base makeup preparatory to going out on stage. Or maybe a guy with a bad spray-on tan. It was distracting!The film is quite low budget. Old newsreel footage does a lot of the plot movement for us, rather than other, less clumsy but more expensive solutions. Technically the film is unimaginative.I know my gripes sound like the film is a failure, but it is still worth watching. The performances are solid, if not quite award caliber. And the amazing story is pretty compelling. The raw material is so good, even this somewhat flat-footed telling can't take away from the sheer ""you've got to be kidding me"" of it. Worth a look."
" Not an accurate biopic
",0.0,0.5879,2021-01-08 00:00:00,1,"This is the case of a typical biopic film from the XXI century.
The story is plenty of mistakes, and things that never happened.
Important characters of the match are forgotten (Like the good icelandic friend and Fischer´s bodyguard Sammy) and others are invented.
But the most terrible thing is the McGuire performance. The physical resemblance with Fischer is zero (teh actor small stature vs Fischer taller figure, for instead) and his acting is not accurate. Fischer was plenty of sense of humour and always smiling in public. This is a Mcguire´s project so the basic chess mistakes of the film are this actor responsible.
A giant figure must be interpreted by a giant actor. What is not the case.
For not to say, a giant story must be written by a giant writer. Not the case too."
" The neurotic genius
",-0.34,0.9131,2020-12-24 00:00:00,5,"Chess has never been a very popular sport or activity in the United States except during the time of Bobby Fischer. Fischer brought a whole new light and popularity to game;in large part because he was the only American in a Soviet dominated field during the Cold War. Pawn Sacrifice covers this aspect of Fischer extensively as well as the other most notable feature of his life...his mental illness. By the time of his death he was practically insane but even as a young man and chess champion he dealt with psychosis. It's not enough to cast in actor who resembles him physically but also one who can convincingly pull off these characteristics. And that's where I believe Tobey Maguire was properly cast in the part. Though he is five inches shorter and doesn't look or even sound like the actual World Champion,Maguire is able to capture his personality and essence. Thus being a believable Bobby Fischer. The film also includes some strong performances from Liev Schreiber and Peter Sarsgaard as well.Pawn Sacrifice is a picture centered around the intense showdown between Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer:the global attention that surrounded it and Fischer's neuroticism."
" A good and interesting biography!
",0.7088,0.9966,2020-12-22 00:00:00,7,"Plot:Set during the Cold War, American chess prodigy Bobby Fischer finds himself caught between two superpowers and his own struggles as he challenges the Soviet Empire.Analysis:Following the first steps to success of the famous American chess player Bobby Fischer this movie tries to tell an interesting story behind a game that included personal ambition, cold war political influence and mental ilnesses. Fischer was a tragic figure and this movie does a good job at giving people a taste of his unique personality. Although, this movie alters the real story a little to make it more cinematic and interesting, the general feeling and the main events are the same, so the viewer can undestand what was going on in Bobby's life at that time.Starting with the good elements, Tobey Maguire proves once more that he is capable at doing great stuff beyond Spiderman and his performance is really breathtaking, he combines that look and the whole feeling of Fischer and does a good job imitating his reactions. The arrogance in his words, the madness in his thoughts, the passion in his eyes, everything is perfect, an acting masterclass from Tobey and a great experience for the viewers. Everyone else was also pretty nice and especially, Liev Schreiber was really good as Boris Spassky, he delivered both sides of hus character and fullfilled his mission in this film.The story follows Fischer from his early years till the big match this movie was made for. Although, the first few minutes were interesting enough there was a huge drop of quality as the film continued until a certain point were it finally found the theme this whole story should have. There are some boring moments, especially until the middle of the movie, mostly because a biography needs to inform people about the details and some of them are really unnessecary. From the point that it gets the right focus, it's way more interesting and quite enjoyable.Pawn Sacrifice was directed by Edward Zwick, the man behind The Last Samurai and that was a huge advantage for this movie. Although, he didn't reach his full potential, there were many interesting choices of camera shots and the general feeling was kept on point, so despite not being his best work, this movie was another example of his great vision and talent. Great capture of feelings, appropriate colours and artistic camerawork are proof that this movie was nowhere near being the classic boring style of many biographies.After all, this is a biographic film. It manages to inform, entertain and give a good taste of society's backround during this time period. It's a full and good experince that although it won't blow your mind, it will keep you interested till the end and will give you enough information to make you look up the story of Bobby Fischer's life. It sacrifices some entertainment to tell the whole story, so some scenes especially in the first half are kinda boring but as the whole story enters the final act, it's way better.Conclusion:It's a great movie, especially for chess fans, it's a great start to make someone search this man's accomplishments, beliefs and life, something that is a result of great acting and direction that really gave this film something special. It could've definetely been more well-written but it's good enough for a nice and memorable experince and a motivation to learn about a great athlete and a troubled man.Rating: 7.5/10"
" Tobey
",0.0,0.755,2020-11-30 00:00:00,1,What's wrong with this movie???? It's the pink elephant in the room casting a short guy to portray a tall guy. It's like casting Andrei the giant to play napoleon. Part of Fischer's aura was his long lanky fingers wrapped around a chess piece with lightning speed banging out genius moves.... he had physical presence because of his height and broad shoulders and how he would tower over a chess board analysing while standing up ...how can short guy pull that off??? Total 100% self indulgence on Tobey to cast himself as Fischer. The only actor that should have been offered the lead role is Nicholas Cage and the movie would have been a massive success.

But it's not only super visually pleasing, it's also a crazy interesting story. This movie was 2 hours long but did not at all feel like it, it pulled you in and once it did, it didn't let ya go!
It kind of takes a little while to pull you in though, it's got a bit of a rough start. It seemed to lack a bit of direction, and it was a bit confusing."
" Doesn't capture chess or the much of the story
",0.0,-0.1494,2020-11-06 00:00:00,4,"Agree with Victorhoz, really wish it captured chess... the boards, the positions, the decision making under different circumstances. I'm also bothered by the film's exclusion of so many critical events in Fischer's career, specifically those not long before the Spassky duel of which 1/4 of the film is comprised."
" A Look into the Top of the Chess World and Convincing Drama
",0.5423,0.9722,2020-08-05 00:00:00,9,"Probably one of the best biographical documentary films / dramas about a chess player living in an intense period of time. And Robert James Fischer definitely belongs in the Top 5 players that have ever lived. I like how they interwove a few scenes of the actual Bobby Fischer at the end and how the chess scenes were mostly accurate. They show some of his novelties however they didn't pay attention to his famous knight maneuvers, together with Morphy's the best in history. Instead the producers focused on the Cold War bout with the Russians. Which is a nice decision for a movie. But they could at least have shown the trap involving the bishop sacrifice from B3 to F7 and winning the queen on D8, which he funnily enough simply obtained from one of those Russian chess magazines, but his GM opponent didn't know.Also in reality, Fischer didn't resign after blundering his bishop in Fischer vs. Spassky Game 1, hoping for inaccuracies, but at that level he indeed might as well have. All in all this is a very good portrayal of the social and mental difficulties tagging along with the full dedication to a potentially brain-wrecking game, and ignoring life's other opportunities such as building relationships. It also shows an outstanding acting performance by Tobey Maguire."

" If you like chess to any extent, you will hate this movie.
",-0.296,0.7473,2020-07-05 00:00:00,4,"Imagine if there was a movie about a famous football player, a striker specifically, and they would not show any goals or the scoreboard in that film. You would see close ups of his legs, close ups of the ball, shots of the applauding crowd in the audience, but no goals or scoreboard whatsoever...This is exactly what this director is doing. You won't see anything that was happening on the board, you won't see positions or moves. There is no respect for the game nor for Fisher nor for the viewer who may be interested about the games.I get it, that a significant proportion of the viewers could not appreciate the details of those positions, but they could at least throw something for those who could, a few seconds when we could see the positions on the board, a few seconds wouldn't be boring for those who are not interested... But no, you get nothing, nothing at all if you are a chess enthusiast. This is disrespectful and lazy.I gave it a 4 solely for the acting, which was decent. As a story about Fisher and chess, it would be a fat zero."

" Brilliant
",0.5859,0.9702,2020-05-27 00:00:00,9,"Toney Maguire is outstanding in thus period piece. Unlike most ""biopics"", this film truly works. This is due to strict adherence to the true story of Bobby Fischer: The greatest chess player in history, who was also had serious mental wealth issues. I remember watching this match live. It is compelling, and sometimes very difficult to watch. I believe this is the best performace of Tobey Maguire's career. Forget about all the comic book Spiderman bruhaha. This is a gut punch of realism. Kudos to director Edward Zwick."
" A story that gripped the world, but not the cinema...
",0.0,0.9652,2020-05-18 00:00:00,6,"This could have been a fascinating account of the troubled life of American chess prodigy Bobby Fischer - unfortunately, Tobey Maguire just couldn't quite convince me that he was that man! The well documented life of this chess genius and of his many demons is the stuff of public record, but this interpretation borders on the melodramatic just a bit too often, and the lead performance is way too one-dimensional for me to get beyond the initial reaction that he was a bit of an arse. An hugely accomplished master of his craft, but as an human being - an arse. There are flashbacks to try and give us some guidance as to the causes of his paranoia - his mother was a communist living in the USA so he genuinely believed that the FBI were listening in on him from a very early age - a neuroses that never left him - and as such his sense of trust was internally compromised and his ability to form meaningful relationships never remotely developed. Liev Schreiber - who really only features towards the very end, does indicate a bit of the grace and professionalism of arch-rival Boris Spassky but it is delivered by Edward Zwick in an almost grudging fashion - the pesky Ruskies will do just about anything to win - except, that is, play fair! It does demonstrate the effectiveness of the cold war chess battle that many of us will recall from the 1970s, but it could have been much more adventurous and less stereotyping with it's characters."
" Mania filled movie
",0.0,0.5442,2020-04-10 00:00:00,1,"09APR2020 {1/10 stars F} Recommend? No; Long and slow movie, with a lot of shaky cam.I did not choose to play this movie, but watched anyway. I only know two things about Bobby Fischer, his name and that he was a Chess champion. What I can say about the movie it is SO! VERY! SLOW! it drags on and on! It is just shy of two hours but felt at least twice as long.Very poorly written and directed movie full of scenes that jump from one thing to another not showing anything of some chess matches and right back to more ranting, raving and paranoid delusions from Bobby! Even if every paranoid delusion and outburst in the movie from Bobby is true it is portrayed very poorly and have no empathy or connection with Bobby. The movie starts with a time jump ahead, don't miss that part.Like other reviews said, I thought Boris, Father Bill and Paul were well acted. But Tobey Maguire as Bobby seemed more like a petulant spoiled kid having tantrums throughout the movie. After awhile I got numb to Bobby's hissy fits and couldn't wait for the movie to end. They should have chosen a better suited actor to play Bobby or not made the movie.CONTENT ADVISORY: One occurrence of the f-word, Bobby meets a hooker that happens to be staying at the same hotel as him and tells her that he wants to lose his virginity, later they are shown in bed together Bobby without a shirt on sitting up in bed mostly covered by a blanket that starts at the middle of his chest and talking about chess moves. The hooker lays next to him on her stomach touching Bobby's arm with her bare back to the camera.Bobby hints at wanting her to leave so she says, ""Well it was great for me too. Thank you."" Bobby replies, ""Thank you"" as he looks the opposite direction from the hooker. Hooker sits up on the edge of the bed with her back to the camera and everything below the lower back is blocked by the blanket on the bed. No other nudity is shown. A lot of cigarette smoking and occasional hard alcohol drinking, even the priest is shown drinking the hard alcohol and in one scene smokes a cigarette.{1=F 2=D- 3=D 4=C- 5=C 6=B- 7=B 8=A- 9=A 10=A+}"

Loved the music! I've never seen Tobey Maguire in a movie (I never was a Spiderman fan) but he's very good. The movie has its funny moments and its intense points. I never realized all the crazy things that go on in the background of these big competitions. From what I remember about this big chess competition, this movie seems to depict the story accurately.

While covering his early life and chess career, focuses largely on the 1972 World Chess Championship match between Fischer and the reigning champion Boris Spassky.Great movie. Shows well Bobby Fischer's exceptional talent for chess and also the mental issues that seemed to be part and parcel of this genius.Always interesting but not consistently engaging though. Coverage of Fischer's childhood and early career give a decent background to how his talent and personality and mental issues developed but aren't compelling viewing. However, when the movie reaches the 1972 World Championship Match it shifts into top gear and becomes incredibly engrossing viewing.Great performance by Tobey Maquire as Fischer. Solid supporting cast that includes Liev Schreiber (as Spassky), Michael Stuhlbarg and Peter Sarsgaard.For an even greater insight into the talent, mind and personal demons of Bobby Fischer watch 'Bobby Fischer Against The World' (2011).

Chess can be an extremely competitive/serious game, and so the excuses come with it, but Bobby had a way of doing in a charming and hilarious way. ""You're one of them, aren't you?""

" Well worth watching
",0.4588,0.9587,2018-04-23 00:00:00,6,"An excellent screenplay by Steven Knight makes chess just about as thrilling as it can get - and you don't need to know anything about chess to enjoy it. Couple with the Cold War backdrop and it works on two levels. It is also a look at Fischer's rather sad decline and it would have been nice to see more of the post-game developments rather than the pre-game story.Some of the direction and/or editing slows the pace a little too much in places and cutting the running time by 15 minutes would have tightened it up considerably, perhaps garnering nother * but it would be churlish to criticise it too much.The actors are all superb with a special mention of Michael Stuhlbarg but that's to single out one gem in a bag of diamonds. And an excellent score by James Newton Howard.It didn't have a wide release but it's well worth watching if you can catch it."
" Could be more interesting...
",0.0,0.7574,2018-04-03 00:00:00,6,"The central theme of the movie is about the historic face-off between the two chess grandmasters of early seventies. The first forty minutes or so stand as a background with a fast-forward narration from Fischer's childhood through his adulthood as a prodigy. The second half is dedicated to the famous Reykjavik chess match with Spassky. Before seeing the movie, I quickly went through the wikipedia article about Bobby Fisher and honestly, found it more interesting than the film itself. Bobby Fisher certainly had an interesting life with ups and downs from his birth to his death and it would be impossible to capture all the important milestones of his life in 115 min. So, the film correctly focused on the culmination of his professional career in 1972. However, despite all the embellished drama over the match, the depiction of the events with a style reminiscent of Rocky Balbao series seems too familiar. Besides that, the hiccupy flow of the movie fails to keep the audience attached. Tobey's acting was good but his potrayal of Fischer as a sociopath went a bit overboard."

The funny thing is, Fischer was much MORE loathsome in real life than as portrayed in the movie. In a more normal world, someone who acted like Bobby Fischer would be locked in an insane asylum and not foisted on the world because of a particular genius. At the same time, the movie is gripping. I came of age the summer of 1972 so everything that happened that summer is still so vivid to me. I watched every second of every game, chessboard in front of me. Anyone of a certain age should really see this movie and relive the period."

In his journey faces many difficulties not only from the Soviet Unions players but also from his owns demons.I have to say that I expected more from this movie because I am always fascinated from biography movies.Despite the good directing made by Edward Zwick, Tobey Maguire makes a poor performance as Bobby Fischer. I liked the interpretations of Liev Schreiber who plays as Boris Spassky and he is very good at it, Peter Sarsgaard who plays as Father Bill Lombardy and Michael Stuhlbarg who plays as Paul Marshall. I believe that these three interpretations saved this movie and I cannot even imagine what would have happened if they wouldn't be there.Finally I believe that ""Pawn Sacrifice"" is a medium movie, don't have high expectations and you won't be disappointed. It's just a simple movie for your spare time and nothing more."
" Sanitized History, Plain and Simple
",0.0,0.3182,2018-01-28 00:00:00,1,"I suppose this is a nice story and the cast is top notch, but the film bares little resemblance to actual people and events. But what is unforgivable, the film gets Bobby Fischer completely wrong, and in doing so, attempts to sanitize the man's legacy.Tobey McGuire is a talented actor, but this was a terrible casting choice. His mannerisms, speaking style and physical appearance are way, way off. The real Fischer was a tall, dark, brooding, anti-social figure. His ugliness on the inside manifested itself in his outward appearance. Tobey McGuire is simply too likeable to play such a role. He tries really hard, but its just not believable.I'm old enough to remember the World Championship match in Iceland in 1972. It captivated the world and made chess popular in the mainstream. Fischer's victory gave America a much needed morale boost during the depths of the Cold War.So, while it was a triumphant moment for America, it was the beginning of a long, painful descent into madness and infamy for Bobby Fischer. The film portrays Fischer as a somewhat lovable eccentric with a paranoid personality. In reality, Fischer was almost certainly somewhere high on the Autistic spectrum. He had other serious mental disorders as well. None of this was clinically diagnosed, but was evident in his actions over the years. He was a loner who treated people very badly. He died
penniless, friendless, as an international criminal. His was not a life to be celebrated.A much better film on the subject is the 2011 documentary ""Bobby Fischer Against the World"". Even the early-90s film ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" tells us more about the man, and the phenomenon than ""Pawn Sacrifice"" does.""Pawn Sacrifice"" is really a big waste of time and resources. The producers badly missed the mark here. The one bright spot is Liev Schreiber who is a perfect Boris Spassky. Frankly, they should have just made a film about Spassky with Schreiber in the lead. Schreiber is one of our very best actors.What is most troubling about this film, as well as many films these days, its attempting to revise history in a way that is most palatable to the masses. This film really misses the point of Bobby Fischer's' life."
" It's not always black and white (lol)
",0.0,0.4949,2017-12-15 00:00:00,7,"What use is winning, if it costs one man his mental health?"" I'm sure this phrase or one like it was coined for the sake of this movie. It features Toby McGuire as real life Chess Champion Bobby Fischer, who was once the greatest player in the world but sadly let the pressure of the game and the attention bestowed upon him slowly drive him to the brink of insanity. He's not the only one though: as we see from the irrational behaviour of his Russian Grandmaster final opponent later on, the rigours of such a complicated strategic game can affect anyone, if they let it take over their existence to the extent as shown here.You don't have to appreciate the finer points of chess to derive enjoyment from Pawn Sacrifice. It would probably help, but the themes of Cold War anxiety and obsessively having to be 'the best' are more universal, and should make it appeal to a larger crowd. McGuire proves he can be so much more than just a webslinger, and we feel every inch of his paranoia as the film goes on: his character shuts himself off from the world, always thinks he's being watched, refuses to eat food unless it's prepared in front of him... one of the earliest 'conspiracy theorists', perhaps?Anyone familiar with the real-life story knows that this movie can't have a happy ending, as the final text during the episode so bluntly demonstrates. All the cheering from Fischer's family and adoring crowds won't change a thing to what occurred after his triumph, and we're left with the stark question: was it all worth it?In this viewers opinion, no. 7/10"
" A very well made movie
",0.3384,0.9744,2017-09-01 00:00:00,7,"PAWN SACRIFICE is, on the face of it, a film about the famous chess match between American and Russian rivals Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky in the 1970s. However, it's not so much about chess, and rather a psychological portrait of a mentally ill man. Fischer was a real character who was adversely affected by the pressure of the international chess scene, and this movie gets inside his head in a very clever and intense way. That's no surprise given that it was directed by the excellent Edward Zwick, who has directed such superlative fare as GLORY and THE LAST SAMURAI in the past. Tobey Maguire gives a very good performance as the nervy protagonist and Liev Schreiber is perfect as his rival; the constantly underrated Michael Stuhlbarg also excels in support. Overall this is a very well made movie, one which kept my interest throughout."
" At least he defends himself
",0.0,0.2229,2017-08-02 00:00:00,5,"It is a film that without being a movie, at least yes that manages to keep you until the end. It is a way of learning something of what happened in this piece of history.I do not usually like either of the two main actors and at least Tobey does not play an impressive role, if he can be convincing.The movie tries to be a good movie, the problem is that it does not get to be it. When you're watching it, you see it's left in every department to be a great movie, none of them are on a level to be great.Photography is not a great photograph. It is a correct photograph, but not astonishing. If it gets you into the age but not more.It's pretty well set up. You think it's the time but at the same time, something fails, there is something that tells you that it is not total. It has a direction that to be Edward Zwick falls short. He is a great director, but this is not his best project. I do not usually like his planning, but he usually gets you completely focused on his films. In this one it does not obtain at all. It has good rhythm and tempo although some moments of archive take me out of the film.I think it will be a movie that will not go beyond its year"
" Interesting well made film
",0.5859,0.8807,2017-06-27 00:00:00,9,"this is a good movie. If you are interested in chess, bobby fischer, the cold war or just history in general this is for you. Great performances all around and Tobey Maguire in particular breathes life into the legend of eccentric chess genius Bobby Fischer. The production values are top notch. The photography is artistic and the script is compelling."
" Great acting, interesting story
",0.7783,-0.0953,2017-05-01 00:00:00,8,"Tobey Maguire is a very fine actor. Regrettably, he is not cast very frequently and since the failure of ""Spider-Man 3"" in 2007, his fans have not seen very much of him. With ""Pawn Sacrifice"", however, he once again showed his talent, depicting American chess genius and grandmaster Bobby Fischer from his childhood years up to the famous World Chess Championship in Reykjavík, Iceland in 1972. Co-starring Liev Schreiber, Peter Sarsgaard and Michael Stuhlbarg, the film has no lack of good acting."
" A bit incoherent
",0.0,0.9312,2017-04-30 00:00:00,7,"""Pawn sacrifice"" centers around the life and game of one of the greatest chess players of all time, Bobby Fischer, and his battle with both the cold war and his fragile mind. It thereby mainly focuses on the events of the World Championship in Reykjavyk.In my opinion, the biggest strength of the movie becomes also its biggest problem. The attempt to create a balance between cold war, Fischer's mind and chess sometimes fails a bit. While much screen time is used to portray the events of Iceland, his breakdown afterwards and the questionable views he expressed are only mentioned very briefly. Somehow the movie still tells this story as an American hero tale, the Soviets are still the bad guys and all in all you can't help but say that this is a quite patriotic movie. I think that taking his whole life into account would have helped to understand better what happened to this man. It is indeed sad to see a brilliant mind fall to very dumb ideas and turn into somebody you need to oppose.As it is, the movie is very much one in a row of movies showing us how pressure in sports or art can break people. Despite all my criticism it is still a good movie, thoroughly produced and the person of Fischer surely delivers enough aspects to turn this into an interesting film. One that is solid, but also one that could be even better."
" Historically Flawed
",0.0,0.9801,2017-04-08 00:00:00,6,"This film takes place during the Cold War with a young American by the name of ""Bobby Fischer"" (played by Tobey Maguire) setting out to become the World Chess Champion which had been under exclusive domination of the Soviet Union for almost 40 years. Yet, even though he was a most formidable challenger there were several obstacles he had to overcome, which not only included an incredible number of skilled Soviet grandmasters, but his own character flaws as well. To that end, this film provides an interesting--albeit somewhat flawed--glimpse into this person's unique quest. Now, having said that, let me first state that I thought both Tobey Maguire, and Liv Schreiber (as ""Boris Spassky"") performed in an excellent manner. However, to be fair there were certain aspects which lacked historical accuracy and should probably be mentioned as well. First, I don't believe this film gives an accurate or honest portrayal of Bobby Fischer. Yes, he would often become quite agitated when distracted by noise. But let's be honest, he wasn't the only chess player to voice his displeasure in that regard. Likewise, there were a couple of times he walked out during certain chess competitions. However, it should be noted that Bobby had religious restrictions which forbade him from playing on the Sabbath. So when his legitimate objections were ignored he did what he felt was necessary. Yet rather than giving him credit for putting his religious beliefs ahead of everything else this film uses this fact against him. Also worth mentioning is the fact that Bobby was very shy and socially awkward. Unfortunately, rather than taking this into account this film makes him look like a raving lunatic instead. Now, that is not to say that Bobby didn't eventually go completely insane. But this was a gradual process which accelerated after he won the World Championship due in part to his feelings of betrayal by the same religious institution he had put so much faith--and money--into. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, Bobby was quite shy and as a result he preferred to do things on his own and was very much a loner. That said, this movie greatly exaggerates the influence ""Father Bill Lombardy"" (Peter Sarsgaard) and ""Paul Marshall"" (Michael Stuhlbarg) had upon him. Further, it should also be mentioned that Boris Spassky was not the World Champion when he and Bobby sat down at the board during the Piatigorsky Cup in 1966--that honor belonged at the time to Tigran Petrosian and it would be another 3 years before Boris could claim that title. To that extent, these are just a few of the inaccuracies detailed in this film--with several other flaws out there that I haven't mentioned. That being said, those who have followed Bobby Fisher's career will probably be less than impressed with the manner in which he has been portrayed. Ironically, in spite of these criticisms, I still found this film to still be entertaining to a certain degree and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."
" Accuracy counts
",0.0,0.8968,2017-03-24 00:00:00,7,"So many historical inaccuracies in the first 15 minutes it was painful to watch as a chess fan. I don't begrudge the actors, the acting was great, but the story seriously needed a lot more accurate research into the time lines. Bobby did not wear suits when he was a kid. He wore sweaters and corduroys. The ""52 Chevy"" he identifies was right after the caption that they were in 1951. Good movie for the masses, but not for those who love chess."
" Great Acting & High Drama In A Wonderful Period Piece
",0.8316,0.994,2017-02-25 00:00:00,9,"Despite the fact that I can't play chess worth a lick (and haven't really even given it all that much of an effort), I've always found the game to be fascinating as the ultimate test of mental acuity. It has been said that just four moves into a match, there are 288 billion permutations thereafter. Wow! ""Pawn Sacrifice"" is the story of perhaps the greatest chess player of all time, Bobby Fischer, and his tumultuous battle both with the Soviet Union's best chess players and his own inner demons.For a basic plot summary, this movie begins with Fischer (Tobey Maguire) not showing up to his promoted matched with Russian Grand Master Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber). It is clear that Fischer is not well. The film then flashes back to scenes from earlier in Bobby's life, where he is managed by Paul Marshall (Michael Stuhlbarg) and mentored by Father Bill Lombardy (Peter Sarsgaard). Despite being a chess genius, without a doubt, there is always the chance that Bobby will dive off the deep end at any second. As his stature grows, he catches the eye of the Soviet Union (locked in the heart of the Cold War with America), who will stop at nothing to make sure their champion, Spassky, is seen as superior. This sets up the epic clash between Spassky and Fischer, where a good deal more than chess is on the line.""Pawn Sacrifice"" is a great film primarily because of the superb acting performances all around. This is the type of movie that needs simmering drama and sustained emotion to succeed (can't rely on special effects or action/adventure), and all those things are provided. Particularly noteworthy is Maguire as Fischer. It's the type of performance that, had the film succeeded a bit more financial, could have garnered him some awards. All the auxiliary cast are spot-on as well.It's also quite a feat to take a movie that primarily consists of two people staring at a board contemplating seem drama-filled. Obviously, the backstory of everything else going on is what creates the majority of the drama, but even the chess scenes themselves are fraught with tension and suspense. For those who think chess is ""boring"", they might have a different view after watching ""Pawn Sacrifice"".Probably the only thing keeping the picture from being truly great is that a bit more development could have been given to the Spassky character. The story of Fischer is intriguing, to be sure, but for every ""hero"" there must be equal shrift given to the ""villain"", and sometimes that fails to happen here. The scenes where Spassky is given some development are great and Schreiber shines, but they just seem a bit few and far between.All told, ""Pawn Sacrifice"" is a great movie for those who like historical biopics or are interested in Bobby Fischer's story or chess in general. The acting performances carry the way, and there is a sense of tension right up to and even through the final credits. You'll never believe that chess can be this exciting!"
" A disjointed, mildly entertaining film filled with historical/biographical inaccuracies
",0.1531,-0.1075,2017-01-18 00:00:00,6,"This is the ultimate problem of historical or biographical films. Films exist on a scale, realistic on one end and Hollywood on the other. Most based on a true story films try to be in the middle. This one went too far the Hollywood side. Notice I didn't say ""entertaining"" - films can be completely realistic and entertaining and completely unrealistic and still be boring.The real Fischer is so interesting, so there was no need to reinvent a new person to tell the story. Fischer had a father figure who was in his life, he just didn't know it was his actual father. Fischer was interested in languages and learned them to read chess periodicals and was not one to go around saying ""Speak American"" to people. The film has Fischer choosing to lose his virginity to a prostitute, picking the person, time and place. He's completely in control. Even though in this same film he can barely control his emotions. In real life he met a girl during the tournament and he got ""caught up in women and sex"" to the point where it cost him the tournament, the only tournament failure in his career. Isn't that interesting enough to make a film out of it? Why change the story for change's sake?Anyway, other than random script issues, which later become editing issues, the story is the weakest part of this film.The rest is top notch. Production quality is high. Liev Schreiber, bravo, bravo, sir, on your Russian.The film, overall, is a highly polished, professionally produced mediocre picture. There is no reason to see it again and it's difficult to recommend to anyone but serious chess or Fischer fans."
