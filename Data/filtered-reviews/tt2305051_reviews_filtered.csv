" Read the book
",2021-04-11 00:00:00,5,Reese Witherspoon is great but this movie is so disappointing if you've read the book. So much is skipped or rushed. I know this has to be done to some extent but not like this. Read the book.
" Love the story
",2021-04-05 00:00:00,8,Great screen play. I'm impressed. Now I wanne know how she's doing ?
" Love that
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,9,"I feel like it's a movie that I should see over and over sometimes
It has so much lessons of living your life and living the moment
I feel like i need this walk to pass over my thoughts and go on for living
Thank you"
" Oscar worthy performance
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,9,Reece delivers portraying Cheryl Strayed as she embarks on a 1000 mile hike of the Pacific Crest Trail from Mexico to Canada. Scenery and landscapes are incredible.
" Good but?
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,7,"An inspirational story and a good movie.I was however looking for more depth and understanding, I felt like they skimmed across the surface of a lot of aspects and the film became more about physical endurance than it did about mental reassessment.Entertaining but missing something."
" An emotional journey towards ""letting it be""
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,9,"This deeply moving film grips onto you and takes you along on a journey uncovering the soul-crushingly painful past of the protagonist, and her way of coming to terms with it, all while delivering a universal message on the value and beauty of life."
" Recipe for betraying other humans and becoming rich and famous
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,1,"If you want to see a movie about how betraying your closest in worst way, whilst being a heroine junkie, and then becoming rich and famous, this movie is for you.The high rating of this movie is not reasonable. Because the content and moral of the story (true story) is utterly disgusting and gut wrenching."
" Just watch the film
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,8,"Just a few lines to say ignore the negative reviews. I'm not sure what some people expect from something like this but they totally miss the point of it all.
It's a wonderful and tragic story about love and loss and hope. That's always something worth your time."
" Has become one of my favorites
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,10,"I've watched about six times. Doesn't get old for me. As others have mentioned, some people will identify and some will not. I think that anyone into hiking or camping will at least get a laugh or two. Lost my mother recently so I understand how it can drive you down an unexpected fork in the road. Everything but the hard drug use hits home for me, so..."
" About biography
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,8,"I rate 8, because of the way the movie tells about, which is not a full story why Cheryl end up doing a wild journey.As in the title, usually I know movies categorized into biography are famous people, while I think this one is not, but I do agree with such story of unfamous person is also worth a movie. Then I thought what should I expect from a biography? an Inspiration, I guess. But to be honest, I am also current in a situation which needs some change, I am not sure if going a such wild trip is a good idea. As in the movie, I think the protagonist got lucky. In a review, some say, marathon, I agree with that sort of challenging but not so dangerous."
" Hollow version of a courageous adventure (and a dull book)
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,3,"I found the book a dull slog and hoped the film would be more inspiring. Regrettably however the film was a heavily diluted version of the book (in my personal opinion), with vast swathes of Strayed's experience left out. This rendered the film hollowed out and meaningless.What Strayed accomplished on the PCT was courageous on many levels, and she writes about it dryly. The film though is an entire swing and a miss, and does Strayed's impressive personal growth a huge disservice."
" Into the wild for the poor
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,8,"Beautiful, just beautiful, but I'm not objective, simular life...unfortunately.Understandable feelings, personal growth, stunning scenery, the ever present grief, funny wonderful and sometimes scary situations during this voyage.I'm a tough guy, but couldn't keep the tears inside.Don't believe the negative reviews, Reese is doing an amazing acting job."
" Best performance by Reece Witherspoon I have seen.
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,9,"An authentic film and for me personally, having walked the Camino from France to the west coast of Spain, can fully relate to the cathartic nature of something like this. In fact, I met a woman, very similar story to the role played in the movie which is why I watched it. This film will be enjoyed by any avid hiker for a number of reasons, and I appreciate the essence of the film might be lost on others. For me.. A definite 9/10"
" Personal growth and wild nature
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,7,"Cheryl embarks alone on an adventure, on one of the most famous (and dangerous) trails in the world, in an attempt to overcome a trauma in her life. It's a film about personal overcoming and growth, connecting with nature and starting over. It is one of those films in which the interpretations are much better than the story itself. The writing is not extraordinary, the (adapted) script itself has already been seen in other films of the same genre, but what makes this film good is the role of Reese Whiterspoon, with incredible dedication and commitment. The cinematography has good moments, and the way that some scenes are cuted and the way that the film plays with the flashbacks, gives a good depth to the narrative. The viewer can relate with the story really easily."
" Read the book first. Really.
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,9,"It is very rare that a film based on a book is enjoyable for someone who loves this book.. This is am exception. This is a very good film that is a celebtaion of the book.Indeed there are so many little things in it that either don't make a great deal of sense or which you will miss altogether unless you have read the book. Even if you spot the sasquatch - for example - it is meaningless without the book. Crater Lake features in the film several times without once even being named - but the book explains.So great film, but so much better if you know the story already."
" This movies is everything
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,10,"I might be biased because of my absolute love toward this bookI read the book twice and watched the movie multiple times.
It's one of adaptations that allows you to actually enjoy reading the book.
Reese Witherspoon acting was top notch
The plot and the plain was too real.
I could rewatch this movie again and again."
" Emotional Story about Overcoming & Healing
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,8,"I enjoy books and movies about self-discovery and personal change. Throw in a beautiful destination and a strong female as the main character and I'm definitely in. So, as soon as Cheryl Strayed's novel came out in 2012, I read it.
And then two years later when the movie came out, I watched it, too. I didn't remember much about the movie, so recently decided to watch it again.And I'm glad I did.I had forgotten what a powerful and emotional story is told in this movie. It's the true story of Cheryl Strayed, played expertly by Reese Witherspoon, as she hikes 1,100 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail. That alone is a feat to be examined and would make for an interesting travel story, but this movie (and Cheryl's trek) is more than just a physical journey--it is also an emotional journey.With the use of flashbacks, Wild helps us understand why Cheryl has decided to take on this monumental challenge all alone without any hiking experience or training--she needs to heal. Cheryl was close to her mother (played by another great actress, Laura Dern) and when her mother passed away unexpectedly, Cheryl went into a downward spiral.The movie is done well and, unlike many other adaptations, doesn't stray too far from the book. As is often the case, you do lose some of background story and you do lose some of the main character's emotional struggle...which means it's a little more difficult to connect to her and really understand her, her past, and her growth through the hike--the ending, then, is a bit abrupt and you don't fully appreciate just how far she's come and just how she found her strength to step off the trail and step back into real life.If you like hiking (especially if you're considering a thru-hike like the PCT) and movies about self-growth, you'll like this movie."
" Nature heals even the worst ones!
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,8,"This is a movie where the protagonist is not a very decent human being. Her mother's death is a very big blow to her and she just disintegrates as a human being. She makes many bad choices. The worst of her sins is her mistreatment of a loving husband whose only fault is that he is very caring and supportive of her. After an even bigger personal debacle, she realizes that she has hit rock bottom. In order to pick up the pieces of her life, she decides to undertake a physically strenuous journey which will take her mind off her emotional pain and focus all her energy on simple day-to-day survival. As expected, her journey through the Pacific Crest Trail is very challenging and the movie depicts the slow catharsis that she experiences along the way. Alone in the wilderness, she starts realizing what really matters in life. She rediscovers the basic values that her mother had instilled in her as a child.The cinematography and the music are quite good. I really like the fact that the movie emphasizes the healing effect that nature can have on humans. It also restores my faith in human resilience; that no matter how far we fall, we can still reform if we put everything we've got into it. In a way, the film displays the triumph of human spirit.The movie is based on a real life story. That said, one still can't help feel that the protagonist is clearly very lucky. She escapes, relatively unscathed, through such a harsh ordeal with so many dangers both from nature as well as fellow human beings. Nature has healing properties but it is not particularly kind to weaknesses and only the strongest can survive. The protagonist was lucky that she found mostly good people and she managed to survive the harsh landscape with dangerous animals, considering that she was carrying nothing to protect her against any mortal danger.What I didn't like about the movie were the distracting and annoying flashbacks which are supposed to have been edited using the most modern techniques. I do not understand this obsession with creating unnecessary breaks in the continuity of the narrative. Those odious flashbacks made me miss the good old movies which were much simpler in their editing and therefore, didn't distract the viewer from the main story. Also, there were way too many sex scenes. I resent this oversimplification where in order to show the protagonist's promiscuous behaviour, the viewers have to sit through so many of their nasty sexual escapades. I believe that the viewers are refined and intelligent enough that even a single scene or two could have made the point. I wish the movie contained less of these gratuitous sex scenes, and was more about the journey and the catharsis that it brought to the protagonist.This could have been more beautiful. It's a shame that some flaws prevent it from being so."
" The inspiring story of one woman's long walk
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,8,"This film tells the story of Cheryl Strayed, a woman who walked 1100 miles along the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) from the Mexican border in the south to the Columbia River on the border between Oregon and Washingtin in the north despite having no hiking experience. Interspersed with scenes of her journey we see, via flashbacks, how her life fell apart following the death of her mother and the collapse of her marriage leading to behaviour that was probably as dangerous as hiking the PCT without being properly prepared.I really enjoyed this film; particularly the scenes of the trek. Normally commenting on the scenery before the story is a sign that something is lacking in the latter but here it is a vital part of the film... I doubt the trail would exist if it wasn't scenic. Reese Witherspoon gives a fine performance as Cheryl Strayed making it easy to believe her character is having a tough time but also is developing as the journey unfolds. In early scenes it would be hard to believe she didn't just die in the Mojave if one didn't know it is based on a real person's experiences but by the end it doesn't feel unlikely that she makes it. The flashback scenes nicely show what led somebody with no experience to try such an arduous walk. Laura Dern provides solid support as Cheryl's mother in the flashback scenes. The story provides plenty of tense moments, as terrain, weather and certain people she meets provide possible threat. Overall I'd certainly recommend this."
" 3 pointer for the photography
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,3,"Spoiler free: ""Wild"" is a story about redemption which bring neither redemption and for that matter any payoff to its viewers. It also delivers an absurd ending where the lead character narrates 'what happened next' , violating the basic rules of exposition.Then again, this happens throughout the movie, and the director, unable to convey emotions through his actors, has them deliver voice overs, akin to so many thought bubbles.You'd think at least the movie would have the courage of its convictions, but it doesn't, it's one ex machina from another to deliver the main character from an endless series of rapists and creeps which seems to populate it.As I said 3 points for the photography as this was shot entirely with natural light, quite the feat, and you can tell there's an AD somewhere in this movie worth his salt trying to salvage it from rack shot hell.It could have been brilliant, unflinching , instead it's a soggy mess."
" Truly unique way of portraying emotions
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,9,"I wanted to watch this movie many times in the past years but always ended up choosing something else for some reason, until yesterday and I'm glad I finally watched it.As the movie started the first feeling was annoyance; you could tell Cheryl was ill-prepared and lacked the experience needed for a 1000 mile hike across the PCT's harsh terrain. It turns out it didn't matter - like they say: amateurs built the Ark, professionals built the Titanic. So yes I got over that, it is better if one knows what they're doing, but one doesn't need to be an expert to hike anywhere.Then it was obvious that this movie was written for women by a woman - I am referring to Cheryl's perspective on things and how she over-dramatized everything. But later I realized its actually very well written, and that perspective started to make sense when the full picture emerged. Also she was very self-aware; yes she was the queen of the PCT, so what?Then was questioning her choice to hike a 1000 miles to deal with the issues in her life. I had similar problems but never needed to go on a hike to deal with them. But then because the movie (and probably the book which I did not read) was written so well, I started to realize together with the Cheryl that grieving happens when you least expect it. You don't know how, and you don't know when, but it will hit you.That last scene with the little boy singing was amazing because it rang truth to my experience (not exactly the same but a bit similar) and how she started to cry uncontrollably, this is when she broke the barriers of grief.It is obvious that the Cheryl was hurting, she wanted to fix it but she couldn't and dealt with it the only way she could. What my experience tells me, and what this movie also showed is that you can see so many psychiatrists, you can read so many books, when it comes to grief, it is a personal experience. That smug cheap councilor did not help at all and I'm glad she did not stop there.Very good movie and highly recommended. Because it is very heartfelt based on true experience, I don't expect everyone to understand it in the same way, and this is obvious in this review section because so many disgruntled reviewers just don't know what they're talking about."
" Made me want to get up and walk!
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,9,"Really enjoyed this movie, it is so inspiring! A story of grief and forgiveness.
Reece Witherspoon was wonderful in it."
" Wild? More like Mild
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,3,"It definitely is a movie with an interesting premise and an interesting opening scene.
Needless to say, it fails to follow up to any possible expectations:
The dialogues are laughable many times.The concept of hiking is probably so boring to the director he had to fill the movie up with overly dramatic scenes.The cuts are often chaotic.However true it might be to the book, it is not good enough as a stand alone movie.
Reese Witherspoon was a perfect fit for this role though, she nailed it. For me, she is pretty much the only thing deserving praise."
" Wild (2014)
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,7,"Like the earlier film but a much more sensitive and darker Jean-Marc Vallee's Wild is a recovery story of a real life women after personal train wreck like life and through a hike she reflects upon her own life through her perspective.Unlike ""Demolition"" this film's got art and style. It is based on a true story and with great substance, the film was executed amazingly with natural cinematography which personally I liked.Overall - 3.5/5"
" ""What if I forgave myself? What if I forgave myself even though I'd done something I shouldn't have?""
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,9,"This was really good, way better than the book even which almost never happens. It follows Reese Witherspoon as Cheryl, a self destructive divorcee with no outdoor experience who makes the rash decision to hike the Pacific Crest Trail alone (one of America's longest and toughest trails) in a bid to conquer her demons. With a heavy backpack and loads of willpower she reflects on her failed marriage, mothers death and downward spiral in life. The kindness of strangers helps her summon the courage she'll need to stay the course.I liked how this was edited, starting with her on the PCT chucking her hiking boots down a cliff and yelling and then with flashbacks to her childhood, her mother, her destructive trysts with men and drug abuse but all shown slowly as she is healing.Reese does a great job, I'm not a huge fan of hers but she was very good, a gritty role for her. I appreciated how they showed that this kind of adventure is dangerous for a woman on her own. I hike or walk alone with my dog deep in the woods ... that scene with the hunters was very scary. Gorgeous scenery along the way. I thought about this movie for days afterwards."
" Better than expected.
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,7,"Wasn't sure I'd like this from it's premise, but it was a lot more interesting than expected. It actually says a lot more about life, death and the human condition than most films and there are many moments of genuine humour too."
" Nice story but awful acting
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,2,"The story is ok, the directing is nice, but Reese Witherspoon has no charisma at all in this movie, I cant feel empathy for her, actually I cant feel anything about her character. Laura Dern's character is good, shame that we see so little of it, a pure mom that discovered true happiness after leaving her abusive husband and raising her kids on her own, but the kids dont give a damn to her, I believe thats and acting problem, or maybe she wants to look happy after all that trouble. It seems like this movie wants to be a mix of Into the wild, Walter Mitty and Demolition, but it fails completely"
" Wild Is a Beautiful Film
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Take a deep breath. Put one foot in front of the other. Repeat until desired result is achieved. Wild is one woman's journey hiking the PCT, leading her into the depths of her past wounds and darkness, ultimately out of the other end to a brighter sky and lighter heart.This movie is based on Cheryl Strayed's book that she wrote about hiking the PCT and losing her mother. Reese's performance was absolute excellence, and it is completely apparent how important this project was to her. She is lost in Cheryl. As for Laura Dern, I honestly think this woman is incapable of turning in a bad performance. Even with the two being only years apart in age, the dynamic of mother and daughter is so clear and perfect.Cheryl Strayed is completely lost after the death of her mother. Her mother was the love of her life, her best friend. She spirals out of control into a drug-fueled self-destruction. The destruction and ruins of all personal relationships, including a marriage, are left in her wake. She has alienated herself completely and is far from the woman her mother hoped she would be. Cheryl decides that hiking the PCT will offer her salvation and clarity. It will put her on the path to being the woman she needs to be. She is a novice hiker at best, and what follows is a harrowing journey of wits, perseverance, and inner strength. The movie is told non-linearly, flashing back to memories of Cheryl's past, sometimes her very recent past. The film is able to keep up a good pace and flesh out Cheryl's character and the relationship between her and her mother with this technique. As Cheryl hikes, she is hot, exhausted, and often on the brink of dehydration. Naturally, her thoughts would drift to memories of her childhood, her mother, and of course to some of the worst moments of her life. The flashbacks serve as a look into her mind at the time which is obvious when she is often singing lines to songs that were playing on the radio at the time or mumbling things said in conversations.This is not a happy-go-lucky film. This is a depiction of a very broken person in pain who is struggling with self-destructive behavior. We are not supposed to be immediately in love with this character. She earns our respect on her trek. The PCT is what she needed to help her transform--to help clear her head and work through the awful grief she is enduring. Ultimately, Cheryl is able to find the woman that her mother wanted her to be on the PCT. She is able to pick up the pieces of her life and find love again later in life while still being able to love her mother and keep her with her without feeling unbearable pain any time she thinks of her.Visually, I thought this movie was beautiful. It was made with a lot of natural light, and it shows. Jean-Marc Vallee is an excellent director, and I appreciate his style. He works well with Reese--obviously, with the further proof of Big Little Lies.My heart ached for Cheryl during this film. Her journey left me heartbroken but also inspired. It's quite amazing what the human spirit is capable of. We can push ourselves to do fantastic things, and Cheryl is a great example of this. Watch this film! Keep your heart and mind open."
" Reese Witherspoon at her best
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,10,"Both Witherspoon and Dern give Oscar-worthy performances in Wild, I was shocked to read that Witherspoon didn't win her second Oscar for it. This movie really touched me because it made me think a lot about life. A really, really good movie I can highly recommend."
" Couldn't like this movie
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,5,"A film of self-reflection and a thousand mile hike across the Pacific coast. Though the film is well done, I could not relate to the main character at all.2.5/5. Sorry, fans."
" Moving life experience
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,8,"Wild is a movie most enjoyed by people who have endured difficult and harsh life experiences. The first time I watched this movie, I cried. I connected with Cheryl Strayed (Witherspoon did a fantastic job in this movie). When life strikes you at your core, sometimes taking time to sort your emotions and find yourself again is a MUST. In Wild, you see a woman who is broken. She's lost loved ones and made some really bad choices in her life. This is her journey to find herself again and put her past behind her."
" A magnificent display of a tough character by Reese witherspoon!!
",2019-12-10 00:00:00,10,Reese witherspoon really nailed it. Wasn't expecting much. You could see her struggles through her eyes.
" A Harsh Life Examined
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,6,"Reese Witherspoon certainly challenged herself when she took on this project based upon a memoir. And the film challenges viewers to endure the hardships of her character's life, hoping for an emotional payoff. I think some will find this film spiritually uplifting and others will consider it an unsatisfying slog through a depressing story.Cheryl Strayed (Witherspoon) made an ignorant and irresponsible decision to hike the length of the Pacific Crest Trail. It was penance and a last-ditch hope for transmogrification of a life without value. Her past was a horror story of bad luck and bad decisions. As a result, she had lost respect for herself.Uninformed and ill-equipped, she learns as she goes, encountering people of all stripes. But most of the time, she is alone with her demons and her memories. We hear her thoughts and view pieces of her unfortunate life. Often there is a stream-of-consciousness feeling to the narrative. Other times, the exposition becomes nearly hallucinatory. These moments feel true to the story, thanks to the direction and Witherspoon's acting.There are few laughs in this film. It is the story of a harsh life. But there is a triumph of will, despite some instances of mere luck. There are not many people to whom I would recommend this film, but I am glad I saw it. And I appreciate the vulnerability that it required of Witherspoon.I don't consider this a film of redemption, but a story of self-education. And it highlights the need for self-esteem that is the core of a healthy existence."
" The movie has really stuck with me.
",2019-10-22 00:00:00,9,"You watch so many movies mindlessly.
I can't even recall half of them but WILD has stuck with me since I first watched it in 2014.
I absolutely loveeeee how the protagionsit isn't protayed as the -I'm so good, so innocent,the world is evil-Cheryl strayed is protayed as a normal human being who acted out when things did not make any sense and I get that. I think we all do, right?I've read many complain about how little the movie shows her survival in the dessert and I get that but the main focus was not the journey but HER journey.
It's so cliche but I love it anyway.Each dialogue, each thought of hers. Hell, even the quotes she writes on the
journey registers- have so much power that it just makes you want to press pause and think about it for a minute. Know what I mean?The ending always gets me.aaaahhhhhh."
" Mumbled dialogue; boring story
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,2,"I wasted two hours on the movie ""Wild"" tonight. ""Boring"" or ""Mumbled"" are more accurate names. The actors, dialog, music, plot, continuity editing, and excess makeup, distracted from the scenery, which the filmmakers managed to make LESS beautiful than reality. You've gotta really work at it to screw it up that badly. Thanks to Apple TV, I only wasted $3."
" Just the Story of a B...!
",2019-09-19 00:00:00,1,"I don't know how the good reviews came about, but for me this movie only shows how an unfaithful and drug addicted person tries to recover herself by walking! I mean whats wrong with you? And whats wrong with her man in this movie try to support her after all she had done? Almost everything makes no sense and is just stupid... next time you could produce a movie about an employee who spits his boss in the face and his boss just gives him a salary increase to help him with his spit problems. Next big hit by this sort of audience .... for sure!"
" Own experience
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,10,"I could see myself many times during this movie, the message behind is beautiful and helps anyone to understand what comes in life and the reward of it."
" A personal journey of 'discovery', but avoids obvious traps of sentimentality and mawkishness.
",2019-08-31 00:00:00,8,"I had hummed and hawed over watching this film or not. I couldn't quite remember if I had heard good things about it or not. I think I may have done, so decided to give it a shot. I was actually pleasantly surprised, and surprised that I engaged with the story so much. I knew and liked Reese Witherspoon from her earlier movies: the cheerful 'legally blonde', the clever film 'Pleasantville', and perhaps the best of the lot the political satire, set in a school, in the film called 'election'.This film is the true story based on the book by Cheryl Strayed (played by Reese Witherspoon) the main character in the film. She is undertaking an arduous and occasionally dangerous hike, alone, along the Pacific coastal trail (PCT); a 1200-ish mile walk in all. The main reason for her hike is to try and come to terms with the death of her mother, and recover in body and mind from her resultant drug abuse and unhealthily sexualised response to that grief.Her past relationship with her mother and her often drug addled sexual encounters are shown in flashback (no pun intended, even if it would have been a good one). These flashbacks never jar though, and really give an insight into her pain, and what she is trying to get away from in her particularly dark past. Laura Dern who plays her mother gives a very warm performance - one that in less skillful hands could have been soppyish. Her performance works though, and you understand the pain, her mother went through, trying to deal with an abusive, alcoholic husband.The direction by Jean-Marc Vallée, while perhaps a little too restrained, despite the scenery that was obviously on offer, does a good job of keeping the multi-stranded story coherent and involving. The script by Nick Hornby probably deserves a lot of the credit for this, as well. It would have been so easy to get the pacing wrong, and make a two hour film of someone hiking feel like an eternity. Yet I was never bored in this film. Reese Witherspoon shows herself capable of taking a tough role on, and while she doesn't need to be that exceptional in the role, she is plenty good enough to take you along with her..Although men do play at times a significant part in her hike, both in flashback and along the hike itself, this is not really a story about them. The film depends on the performances of both Laura Dern and Reese Witherspoon to keep your attention. They succeed in doing so.."
" Good for travellers
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,8,Its A really good movie for young travellers. One girl's journey portrayed in this film Very well. One should not miss this.
" It inspired me
",2019-08-19 00:00:00,9,Yes there were dark stories to tell but my focus was on the inspiration. Never heard of the PCT before and it started a fascination for me. Read lots of hiker stories since then.Laura Dern is great in this and Reece's character is challenging to like at times but you soon see the human frailty. Yes it's told from a female perspective and I think some reviewers forget that. It's not demonising men. It's told through the eyes of Cheryl. It's HER perception of life/reality. Not a social piece designed to please all.
" Inspiring tale of self-discovery.
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,10,"After filming the critically-acclaimed ""Gone Girl"" with director David Fincher, actress and film producer Reese Witherspoon obtained the filmmaking rights to a biographical novel by author Cheryl Strayed. The novel talks about Strayed's story of redemption where, after a lifetime of abusing herself, embarks on a journey of self-discovery by hiking the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), a trail on the west coast that begins at the border of Mexico and ends at the Canadian border. The film, directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, would be entitled ""Wild"", and would feature Witherspoon (who is also the film's producer) portraying Cheryl, and as she makes the difficult trek through the trail, we also witness the events of her past that led to her decision to take on the PCT, from her difficult life with her family since childhood, her eventual experimentation with heroin, selling herself for sex, and the troubled relationship with her mother.When I first saw this picture a while back, I never thought I would be as captivated in Cheryl's journey as I am to this day. Her story of having to trek through over one thousand miles of rough terrain in order to get a new start in life is a fascinating and inspiring one. As we see her struggles both on and off the trail, we delve futher into Cheryl's character and why she goes to the extreme in order to recover from her past.One thing to note about the picture is the brilliant cinematography that brings out the color of the environments, and how they chose not to keep the camera steady to keep with the natural aesthetic, despite the fact that, even though the PCT spans through several U.S. states, practically all of the film is shot in Oregon (my home state). I also love the musical choices for the soundtrack, with the highlight being Simon & Garfunkel's ""El Condor Pasa (If I Could)"" serving as the film's theme.I absolutely love this film, not just because it's one of the best independent pictures I've seen, but because it's a powerful tale of cleansing one's soul through determination and perseverance. This is a must-watch for anyone looking for an empowering story put on motion picture film."
" Woman Only
",2019-06-04 00:00:00,10,"I've watched this movie a few times and the character Cheryl Strayed is one of most interesting charters in recent history. I do feel that this film has not received the true recognition it deserves. Perhaps...in my opinion is because of the unbelievably accurately portrail of woman today. The demons that we face, and unrealistic expectations were supposed to try and live up too. This character challenges everything the male population perceives as a good woman. Yet she becomes extraordinarily strong and self aware. This film will challenge what and how you believe a woman should behave. When I walked out of theater I overheard all the men being extremely judgemental of the main character. And yet the woman were very quiet. It's as if Cheryl Strayed is all of us. A part of us were afraid to share or speak of..."
" So realistic
",2019-05-17 00:00:00,10,"I rated this movie with 10/10 for one reason. The conversations that woman had in hear head, the memories and the guts. Amazing movie."
" Decent, but just that.
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,4,"I won't bore you with the details of the plot, but if you're here, chances are, you're here because either you are a trekker, or have watched Into The Wild.It's no coincidence that these events took place a few years after McCandless and it is of no coincidence that this film is similar in many, many ways.It feels like a pet project and I think, at times, it shows. RW has never struck me as a great actor - this film does little to change that notion. When you play in a biographical film, you're taking on a lot of responsibility, and this here film looks like RW, playing make-believe.There are many struggles one faces on a trail, but most of the real-life struggles aren't portrayed and the filmmakers focused on the characters life and troubles. This has been done before with Into the Wild and I really wanted to like this film, but the similarities with Into the Wild, directly pit it against Into the Wild, and it fails.Men are torrid, yes, we get it - but people don't need reminding of that every other scene.If you're looking for the female version of Into the Wild, this is it, but don't expect to like the character - maybe this is the point, who knows? I don't even think the film itself knows what it wants to portray.I wouldn't recommend this film, it doesn't have much of a centre and tells of the woes of someone running (or walking) from their demons. The character isn't likable enough to warrant redemption, but hey, people are going to be inspired by McCandless and this is what this is.Do yourself a favour and read the summary on IMDB, it'll save you time and effort and will tell you whether or not you should invest your time in this film."
" If body goes wild, mind goes beyond the limits of tranquility
",2019-04-01 00:00:00,7,"If body goes wild, mind goes beyond the limits of tranquility, peace and calmness in a new challenge of acquiring free agitation of mind and spirit again. With a very deep conversation between Cheryl and Bobbie (mother), you can predict of one thousand mile hike in an attempt of recovery of childhood and past tragedy. Not only soliloquy reveals Cheryl's fragile character in facing her marriage setbacks and her mother's death, but also it shows the strength and determination of heeling up the past wounds. Wild is a back to nature journey where exploration is good enough to purify the inside dark blemishes."
" A lot better than I expected
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,7,"I started watching this expecting a terrible representation of an interesting story but then I got pretty amazed. The story was really good, the fact that it is a true story makes it even more impressive. Character development was a bit drawn out with the flashbacks and such, but it kept viewers interested and curious til the ending scene. Reese Witherspoon was fine, in some part she wasn't good as she could be in delivering the emotions ;but overall, she did a great job. Cinematography was good, some nature scene was well-shot, well-lit. Some editing part was a bit off, some part was a bit too long (For example the first 5 mile scene) and the first few flashbacks are too fast for people like me to process them. The choices for music was not too appropriate for some scene (such as the sex parts). Could have been and 8 or 9 if the opening parts were edited better. Still would recommend this to you all because of the amazing story and the script writing"
" Inner and Outer Journeys
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,7,"Reese Witherspoon portrays Cheryl Strayed who wrote the autobiography on which this film is based. The story follows Strayed on her inner and outer journeys as she hikes the U.S. Pacific Crest Trail after a series of setbacks in her young life.""Wild"" ably meets the challenges of maintaining an audience's interest while focusing on one person's journey as she reflects on her life with occasional inner-dialogue and flashback memories. There are various reasons why this works.Director Jean-Marc Vallée provides the right balance of hiking adventure with flashbacks while keeping the inner-dialogue to just the right minimum, ensuring the movie is more than just a narration.Likewise, Witherspoon easily takes on the challenge of maintaining viewer interest while being in almost every frame of the movie. She comes off as a likeable protagonist who faces occasional drama but is mostly engaged in the day-to-day challenges of being out of her comfort zone.The film has a couple of scenes where danger is anticipated but not realized. In sticking to the true story, there is even greater impact and surprise by avoiding the worst possible outcome.Another notable performance, even if rather brief, is Laura Dern as Cheryl's mother who is shown in various flashbacks. At first, she comes off as gently naive but shows later that she can truly find the best attitude about life no matter the circumstances.Oh yes, and let's not forget the beautiful scenery."

" Almost Perfect Immersion Into Life
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,9,"10 January 2015. Some people would compare Wild to Sean Penn's Into The Wild (2007) where a 24-year old student sells off his possessions and then hitchhikes to Alaska to live in the wilderness. Instead a closer comparative movies might be Kevin McDonald's Touching The Void (2003) about two climbers who brave the Andes Mountains or Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation (2003) about an American television star who is hired to perform in a commercial in Japan. While Sean Penn directs a movie which in replete with fantastic and mesmerizing photography along with the performance by Emile Hirsh where both background and foreground seem to compete for attention, Sean-Mark Vallee has created a backdrop that enhances the performance of Reese Witherspoon on her 1,000 mile hike on the Pacific Crest Trail.Wild might even be compared, in part, to the immersive, first person experience of horror classic The Blair Witch Project (1999) using a fusion of first and third person perspectives. Both McDonald and Coppola achieve in their movies like Wild are natural experiences that are artistically crafted to reflect ordinary but interesting events or sensations. The power of Vallee's direction is his ability to maintain engagement with the imagination of the audience. Surprisingly the move offers little in the way of drama ordinarily but quite the opposite. Vallee brings to more meaning to little experiences that we often take for granted as well as the novelty of the reasonable possibility of actual live experiences that we ourselves might be able to witness.Vallee's use of flashbacks as actual recollections of memory is one of the most effective elements of this movie that seem to parallel the brief mental sensations we have in our own lives. Nick Hornby and Cheryl Strayed's screenplay from her own personal memoirs captures the audience in a slow unfolding story of personal discovery of the backstory to Reese Witherspoon's character through effective flashbacks while she is hiking in the present. With only one noticeable continuity error regarding a book cover and Reese Witherspoon's sudden break down and crying scene, this movie seems flawless in production.In sum, Wild is a quality film experience along with a pertinent, relevant snapshot of life and endurance."

" SO much to appreciate
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,9,"A story about a real-life woman carrying figurative and literal baggage while she hikes the Pacific Crest Trail on foot while processing her messy past... Wild is a very complex and nuanced portrayal of a real-life woman's external and internal journey.
This film can be so easily overlooked but there is so much to appreciate:
It is heavy, devastating, empowering, with great performances, directing and editing. If you enjoyed Big Little Lies, this will be up your alley; David E. Kelley is great at stitching together flashes of haunting memories in a surreal way that somehow manages to reveal a character's ghosts and their life's story without causing confusion and trusting his audience. Reese Witherspoon is killing the producer game, and this is the best acting performance I've ever seen from her."
" FIND YOUR BEST SELF
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,10,"Cheryl Grey/Strayed is hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. While being a farm girl, she knows nothing about hiking and camping, making many mistakes. She makes friends along the trail to help her. The reason for her journey is to become reborn. She wants to become the person her mother raised and expected her to be. The film has numerous flashbacks to her past, her mother's death, her marriage, her heroin use, her infidelities, and family. She remembers the good and the bad, life's pain and frustrations. Cheryl is educated and leaves poems and quotes along the way in the hiking journals, becoming the ""Queen of the PCT.""It is a story about starting anew and seeking redemption.Reese gives us a great performance. Her rediscovery is not based in religion. She develops her own philosophy along the way, her own goals, and learns the value of having shoes that fit. A film with a few hidden metaphors. I felt the film was geared more toward women then men, but enjoyable nonetheless.Guide: F-bomb, brief sex, nudity (Reese Witherspoon)."

" Like a sparkle in the dark this movie shines brightly
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,10,"I was making a list of movies that I was going to see this week, and this wasn't on my list, but something made me pick this up at the last moment. I am extremely glad for it. This movie is very inspiring, has a strong message and has a lot of heart in it. Aspire to be your best self no matter what life throws at you. This message will never get old because each of us suffers from a severe case of ADD and suffers from memory loss, forgetting most of the things we decide to do with our lives. Thus, we need to be reminded of it continuously. It is challenging but it is worth it since that is our only goal in our life.Cheryl is a flawed character, like all of us, lost in the tiny space that was her life. She tried to cope with it by denying it, escaping for it for some long years. But like every action you take she suffered their consequences, and gave up her faulty ways in the end. Now she was empty, filled with guilt for her choices, wanting desperately to feel something different but couldn't. She decided to do something extremely challenging which she had no idea about to discover something different in her life. With hope of a new future, she embarked on the untraveled road leaving behind everything familiar to her. She lost her faith in herself many times along the way but never gave up her decision to see it through the end. She realized that despite all the challenges she faced, she was still here. All the things that happened to her had led her to this place. She had faced her deepest fears and realized that they don't hold her back anymore. Just the decision to face them had set her free as if they were nothing but an illusion in her head preventing her from going ahead. Forgiving herself for everything she had done, she rediscovered herself unbounded, invulnerable and ready to face anything this mysterious life throws on her. This was beautiful, and the director conveyed this tall task convincingly with the help of stellar performance from all the actors, the cinematographer, and amazing music developers."
" Astoundingly Bland
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,5,"Most of the reviews seem to have more of an issue with the character ""bottoming out"". My issue isn't with the idea of this character hitting absolute rock bottom before deciding to go on a 1,000 mile hike with no experience. No. My issue is with how astoundingly SLOW this movie is. I was constantly feeling like I was missing something, which may have to do with not reading the book before watching the movie. The scenery was mediocre for what they could've done and I feel like they could've shaved 30 minutes off of this film to come up with a much better movie."
" A movie that won't disappoint
",2018-06-01 00:00:00,9,"Wild is a movie about human, nature, animal, love, friendship, family, marriage, joy and grief, life and death, sex and drugs, rights and wrongs...It's a movie about a lot of things you might constantly have on your mind about life, if that makes sense. The main character talks to herself about the unstoppable events life threw at her and how she reacted, like we all do from time to time, and it's refreshing to see that on screen. She searches for a way. Reese Witherspoon portrays the character very well, both physically and emotionally. A movie rarely spans 'things about life' in such a successful way, in my opinion. Very recommended!"
" spoilt by poor sound quality
",2018-01-23 00:00:00,5,May as well have been in French as I could hardly make out a word of the dialogue. The actors spoke very indistinctly and the volume was practically a whisper. Spoiled an otherwise very good film.
" Real story, brave film
",2018-01-11 00:00:00,9,"Reese impersonates and acts so well, I was transported to her character psyche. This point of view of the evolution of the woman worked very well for me. The flashbacks were very real as well. Cheryl Strayed was very involved personally and it makes this film even more real than the usual reenactment. The film wasn't too shy about the real story and more force to it. Great film about a great adventure that a real woman had the courage to take. Need more of them!"
" Wild
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe acting is great throughout the entire film. Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern both do an exceptional job at portraying their respective characters. The characters themselves are deep and well thought out. Reese Witherspoon, in particularly, does a great job at playing a character that is broken and wants to be fixed.The story is really good. There are moments that are uplifting and moments that are hard on the heart. It is a story about redemption and finding peace in being human. The story is easy to follow and has some heavy moments throughout.The scenery is amazing. The Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) is an amazing location. As the movie progresses, you get to see different landscapes and scenery.For me, there was a good amount of nudity in the film that could have been avoided. I think they could have implied the sexual acts without showing them. I do like seeing Reese naked, but some of the scenes did not need to be in the film.The ending is good but it left me wanting more. I wanted a stronger realization.Pros: Great acting, deep characters, compelling story, some emotional impact, and amazing sceneryCons: Some needless nudity and needed a stronger sense of realization Overall Rating: 8.3/10P.S. If you enjoyed this film, you might also enjoy Into The Wild. Into The Wild is one of my all time favorite films. It is very similar to this film but has, in my opinion, a stronger ending in terms of realization."
" Brilliant. But for my seventies angst
",2017-12-30 00:00:00,8,"Too much struggle and not enough victory/ peace. 'Lone Survivor"" had the same angst. Do you go to a movie theater? I don't as there is always a spoiler alert fart monkey in the audience. Terrible place to bring a date.Keeping true to the rattlesnake encounter, I would love to see the lead run away then get mad and even then beat the damned thing with her failing boot.Wrong story point was from desert to Pacific Northwest in twenty minutes. As a Former Marine that did as much hiking as a kid and more miles as an adult. Empathy. There are a lot of strange rangers on any path. If this movie was to convince dumbsitcks to leave a lost girl alone on a Journey, then it failed. 
Lose the drug 70's thing culture premise/ angst. Remake in five years."
" More beautiful and impactful than I expected
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this film, but I'm slightly biased since I really enjoyed the book too. Still, it's rare we see strong and complex women adventuring in American cinema. And it shouldn't be. This film let itself unfold in images and thoughts and moments, mostly resisting the urge to tell rather than show. And it overcame the familiar territory and unavoidable cliches to be a movie that worked."
" The Best I've Ever Seen From Reese Witherspoon
",2017-12-16 00:00:00,9,"I'm accustomed to seeing Reese Witherspoon in lighter fare than this. She's generally pretty good in that kind of stuff, but just the genre itself means that she's never really ranked in what I would call my ""A"" list of actresses. But my appreciation of her talent increased immensely when I saw her in ""Wild."" She carries this movie on her back just as much as her character carries her heavy backpack throughout most of the movie. She's in pretty much every scene, so nothing really happens without her, and she's excellent. With all due respect to Julianne Moore, Witherspoon probably should have won the Oscar for best actress that year, and why ""Wild"" did not even earn an Oscar nomination is beyond me. I'm aware that Cheryl Strayed (on whose memoir this movie is based) said that it was a case of sexism - suggesting that because the movie was based on a woman's experience it didn't get the respect it deserved. Whether that's true or not I have no idea, but overlooking the movie was a huge and sad oversight.As Strayed, Witherspoon was portraying a very troubled young woman dealing with a whole lot of demons in her life - an abusive father, a loving mother who died far too young, a failed marriage. All those things led to drug addictions and sexual promiscuity and eventually an unwanted pregnancy until Cheryl finally decides to basically find herself and get her life back together by committing to hike about 1000 miles along the Pacific Crest Trail - in spite of the fact that as far as hiking goes she's completely inexperienced and totally unprepared. The movie does a superb job of following her along the trail, recounting some of the experiences she has along the way. You expect her to encounter trouble, but although some of her experiences are (or seem) threatening, nothing really bad ever happens to Cheryl, and for the most part she meets a lot of really nice people along the way. It's more a case of the mood that gets set along the way. In fact, most of what happens on the Trail is so unexciting that I can't even call them adventures - and so I use the word ""experiences."" But the story isn't so much about the Trail or what happens to her - it's about a journey of self-discovery; a journey that helps her come to terms with who she is and where she's been and - just maybe - where she's going. Director Jean-Marc Vallee, I thought, did a great job of moving forward a story that wasn't really ""exciting"" but keeping it interesting all the way through. The movie intersperses the story of Cheryl's hike, with her backstory, through flashbacks as far back as her childhood and up into her troubled adulthood after her mother's death, and these flashbacks certainly help us to understand how Cheryl got to the point where she needed to do something to re-centre her life. I'm not sure that, in similar circumstances, I'd choose a 1000 mile hike - but she did, and it seemed to work for her.There's really not much to criticize here. The ending may be a little bit rushed - this was a rare movie that left me thinking that maybe there could have been just a bit more? But, overall, I was really impressed with this. In some respects it reminded me a little bit of the 1999 movie ""The Straight Story."" I wasn't sure that a movie about a woman going on a long hike would be able to keep me interested for almost two hours. But it did. (9/10)"
" Phew....what to say about this movie?
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,6,"I usually wouldn't rip a movie apart like I'm about to do because most movies I watch don't irritate, irk or bug this heck out of me. This one did, but maybe that's just a personal thing. I hated this movie! Even though Reese Witherspoon acted the part very well, the movie was pretty boring, very long and drawn out (it dragged) and it was an overly dramatic flick that would not end soon enough. Some of the editing was sub-par with abrupt cross-overs from her memories back to her present-time. Granted, I should have never watched a movie like this on the FXM channel, which is not high- definition and I had to deal with commercials as well. It was by far, the worst movie I've ever had the pleasure of wasting time on. The movie itself was not awful (including the plot), just the little pieces and parts that caused it to drag on. And to think the movie could have been even longer because of the journey she took on that trail. I'm not going to give it a low rating because of my awful experience watching it, but it's not going to get a 7 Star rating. I have to go see what others are saying about it....out of curiosity. It has its own good qualities, so don't take my review of it at too much face value. You really have to watch it and form your own opinion. I think watching it in High Definition would have made a much better experience. Maybe the poor editing issue I experienced was due to that alone."
" Close portrait of a life struggling woman. Reese is brilliant!
",2017-10-26 00:00:00,8,"A girl with life struggles, that finds her way. Somewhat typical but don't be fooled. This is a very high level of acting and if you like and respect Reese Witherspoons work this is for you. I really like her for the work she did in Walk the line and Big little lies. Big little lies ain't my type of series, more a typical show for women watchers in my opinion. But awesome acting from Reese Witherspoon really got me going. So when I finished the series I searched for more work from her and I find Wild. Not disappointed. Got the similar experience like from Big little lies."
" Avoidable
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,4,"This movie is about how a young woman who has suffered much in her brief life-mother dying of cancer, abusive alcoholic father, drug addiction, sex addition-discovers her true self and her will to live by undertaking an arduous three month long walking trip along l along Americas West coast.- the Pacific Crest trail The movie is watchable but is marred by too much cursing, graphic depictions of sex and bad language."
" Like watching paint dry that's been put on the wrong wall
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,3,"Oh yeah, I forgot....didn't pay attention when I chose to watch this....the warning sign was there all along...a film with Laura Dern in it. This tale, whether based on real story or not, is true 100% crap. Music choices were OK though but not featured enough to soothe the pain of having to sit through the disjointed dysfunction stuff. The main character Cheryl seems incapable of learning anything or making sense of anything that happens in her life. I presume she's a stream of consciousness kind of person who is so off in cloud cuckoo-land that practicalities are anathema. There's no entertainment or education to be found here. The Hornby treatment is perhaps novel but not enough to warrant this dire waste of your time."
" A ruggedly beautiful yet powerfully moving journey of a girl to overcome her obstacles in life.
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,8,"An intriguing title and these 2hours, never a disappointment for me. With an exceptionally out of the box story-line,the film kept me wanting till the very end. Extremely moving and strong emotions throughout, where Cheryl, the protagonist, decides to take the walk to change her life for the better. The never- ending pain from her mother's death, unhealthy addictions and lifestyles, a heartbreak are only some of the odds she puts up a fight against on her road to self discovery. This journey through the wilderness of nature was as much of a learning experience for me as for Cheryl. Trying to deal with a personal tragedy myself, I could connect much easily through her array of thoughts and actions and the film only inspired me. However the only turn off was its such an abrupt ending. I wished The Pacific Crest Trail never ended."
" Awful
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,1,"The only reason I gave it 1 is because I can't score it under 0. Can you believe it? Hollywood decided to make a film about, a woman behaving like a prostitute and in real life the actual woman who done it, in her interview she said, it was a spiritual journey for her. Yeah by sleeping around with so many men.. Is that a spiritual journey for you??? This world is so full of filth and disgust and Hollywood encourages it by making these kind of films. And to Reese Witherspoon: Really?? You couldn't choose to make another film instead of that garbage? Anyway, I guess it does say a lot about a person about his/her choices that makes."

" Reese Witherspoon is tremendous in his poignant biopic of self-discovery and tragedy
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,7,"Reese Witherspoon is not an actress typically known for taking on serious roles, with most of her filmography dealing with comedies. Although the actress has had a few non-comedic roles in the past, most of them are not well remembered by this point. This biopic based on the emotionally riveting memoir by Cheryl Strayed, a woman who set out on a life-changing journey in 1995, grants Witherspoon with the grand opportunity to expand upon her acting muscles and expose a rarely open area in her talent. It is a biopic centered on a woman plaguing with tragedy, grief, hope, and redemption; and the story follows as this woman ventures on a quest at puts her physical and emotional stability to the test. Although the film may not reach the heights of cinematic mastery in terms of storytelling nor does it strike for anything special, there is plenty of talent to be witness in its near two- hour runtime. Directed by Jean-Marc Vallee, this movie follows the true story of Cheryl Strayed (played by Reese Witherspoon), a twenty-something year old woman strained by her rocky marriage with her husband Paul (played by Thomas Sadoski) and troubled by her dark past including the death of her mother (played by Laura Dern). Searching for hope, Cheryl sets out on an 1,100 mile hike from Minneapolis, Minnesota to Oregon where she discovers her inner being, while placing herself in path that will put on a physical and emotional endurance. The story of Cheryl Strayed is fascinating, especially when he brings up memories of the Chris McCandless story (whether you read the biography or watched the film 'Into the Wild') which took place just a few years prior to the events in this biopic. The film however, is not empty of dull moments which are likely to alienate viewers with low patience. The story here focuses on a woman who put herself on a collision course with self-discovery in attempt to tear away from her harrowing past which involved her abusive father, the untimely death of her mother, and her failed marriage. Along the way, she is forced to deal with the punishing atmosphere of the deserts while suffering from the scarcity of food and water. The story is frequently intertwined with flashbacks showcasing the happy days and dark days of her past, a storytelling method opens up to both the best and the worst of Nick Hornby's screenplay. While the flashbacks of her past greatly contribute to the three-dimensional construction of her character as well as the emotional backbone, the editing of these scene transitions can occasionally serve as a burden to the pacing. Director Jean-Marc Vallee keeps things moving, but at a slow momentum. Luckily, this does nothing to take away from the uncompromising performance by Reese Witherspoon. The actress shines in the role with astounding emotional resonance as well as exercising both of her physical and emotional range. Regardless of whether she is likable or not, it is hard not to sympathize with the heartbreak she suffers from and hopes of escaping her life of pain. Witherspoon's performance greatly pays off when she is sharing the screen with Laura Dern who is stupendous in the role of her late mother, who's screen time is limited in flashbacks. The relationship between the two shoots for an absorbing emotional spark that greatly fits the bill, and when the story dives into her death and the grief that follows, it safely avoids the pitfalls of sentimental contrivance. Now don't feel like this movie is a thing of darkness, there are some happy moments to be sparred. Wild is a poignant, yet inspiring biographical drama that shines with an riveting performance by its lead starlet and benefits with touching the heart with its powerful story. The film is not set to impress nor fascinate everyone, particularly those who are more inclined to faster-paced stories or something less melancholy. Nonetheless, it is filled with talent that should not be ignored."
" Do Something Great
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,8,"I agree with Tom Berraras' review, but not his three star rating for Wild.This is a story that deserves to be told, and it was told well. Reese proved right for the part. What I liked most about the movie was it's refusal to candy-coat neither the ""earlier"" part of her life, nor the hike-segment experiences. The movie was from an auto-biography, so it apparently stayed close to the original illustration.What I would have like to have seen were 1.) A few minutes on scenes that showed what went through her mind when she chose to do the Pacific Coast Trail. How did her friends and family react? How did she make her gear selection/purchases? Also, some more inner dialogue along the Trail would have been good.There was some, and I recognize this, but there must have been some thoughts/feelings that were relatively cheerful/positive that propelled and sustained her on her journey. We see, instead, mostly recollections of negative past experiences.All-in-all, this is a memorable movie and one well-worth watching. It takes very few dramatic liberties, but instead is a sometimes-hard look at the life of one emotionally wounded person and her search for the unconditional joy that her mother offered her.Some more exploration of the evolution of the inner person would have been helpful, but I enjoyed Wild very much."
" Enjoyed this movie
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,8,"When the credits rolled I asked myself: ""Why have I just watched this film""? A young woman soul-searching after her mother's death ... OK, so Reese Witherspoon is very pretty, but it had to be more than that, and so it was. I think it helps that I backpacked myself - meeting a wide variety of eccentric characters in my journeys(but without the sex, unfortunately). I empathised with Cheryl; enjoyed the score and the cinematography. Plus, there was a bit of feel-good factor towards the end ... and what is wrong with that?"
" Perfect Theme, Lacking a Couple Key Features
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,8,"Reese Witherspoon played her role has Cheryl with enough emotion, fear, and pain to make it not only believable, but tough to watch. It's nice to see Reese Witherspoon in a role that doesn't involve her being just a pretty blonde. The outline of the story was very well done and the idea of the theme blended so well with the story, that I felt changed in some way as well. The thing about this movie that really stands out is the way the director makes ever viewer feel as if they are experiencing the pain she is feeling and how relatable she seems at the first point in her journey, clueless but determined. The beginning dragged out but the biggest problem was that most of the suspense and drama were shown in mostly the flashbacks. I mean she is alone in the woods! The part with the creepy redneck and when she ran out of water was about it. There came a time in the movie, where I felt as if she was in no danger on the trail. Understandably the flashbacks were meant for most of the drama, but I believe the two story lines could've connected better through more action on her journey. It was interesting to see two different stories play out well seeing how neither plot could survive without the other. Despite some long parts and unnecessary b role, a key part that made this movie successful was that the resilient and well liked Reese Witherspoon's, Cheryl, was so simple. Cheryl, the protagonist, is a good character for this film. She is not a super being, not a saint, just a person. That's why she becomes so relatable, we want her to win, to beat this trail. Possibly because we would want ourselves to win in this situation, and see a part of us in her. Another idea that was present, was the idea that her journey was symbolic in the sense that it was her way of finding herself, letting go, and freeing herself from the past she desperately held on to. Thus ending her journey with almost seeming enlightened, which for many makes this hike a representation of life itself. Death, fear, sex, all get the heart racing in this Women vs. Nature Drama. Many parts of it became too long, the story could've focused more on the trail, and there could have been more suspense, but the acting, directing, and main theme of the movie help overlook that and make this a well worth 120 minutes."
" A biographical and introspective view into a woman's life
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,8,"I like biographies and from this movie I glimpsed that probably the book it is based on was worth reading. The movie is very good as well, with Reese Witherspoon doing a good job portraying this woman who decides to hike 1100 miles in order to come to terms with her grief and put her life in order. However I have to give kudos to the director and screenwriters who managed to put this idea into a digestible movie. I would think it is very difficult.The film is very introspective, it touches on subjects like the death of a mother, the decay of a relationship and of a person until the only solution is a hard look inward. A refreshing film, but not one that feels entertaining or light of funny. You gotta be in the mood."
" A thoughtful movie for quiet reflection
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,9,"Quite simply, if you want jaw dropping action or revelations then this movie is not for you. I walked with her. Through the entire film. I was there. I saw her pain and felt it. It didn't have me sobbing into my hanky because it was not a pityfest. It was plain and simple. This woman wanted to change or die. I wanted her to make it. I watched her suffer and rage and fall to pieces. Then i watched her get up, dust off and take on another day. I was this woman and I wanted to make it to. Reese Witherspoon as always gave it her all. The only reason it dropped a point was some of the writing was far too small and squiggly for me to read so I had to pause it to check what it said. If you are feeling a bit lost or displaced or at a crossroads in life, give this a watch and see her STRYDE"

" A Journey to Wholeness
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,10,"The film has many useful attributes, the most obvious of which is that shows how to heal after hitting a emotional bottom on one's own. Indeed, the idea of working through the trauma on one's own is key to the film.This core message is one that makes intuitive sense. However, the logic of this message is most often ignored in the topic that the film deals with most directly: opiate abuse and a related emotional bottoming out.Wild gives a real-world example on how to turn a physical journey into a journey oneself, again after abuse of opiate drugs and what looks like a ""bottom."" However, rather than go to an AA or 12 Step meeting and chant over and over again that she is powerless over her drug of choice, and even her own life, the heroine takes on an amazing mental and physical challenge and proves that she is anything but ""powerless."" I'm sure the intentions of the author of the book that inspired the film, or even the makers of the film were not thinking of drug treatment or the increasing controversy surrounding AA and 12 Step, nonetheless the film provides interesting commentary on what many think is commonplace knowledge on drug treatment.AA and 12 Step attempt to cultivate feelings of personal powerless in members and insist that this helps to foster a healthier individual and is recovery. Yet, in all other contexts concerned with healing empowerment is a positive. The only groups that consistently work to undermine an individuals sense of competence are religious cults, which should suggest that AA and 12 Step is not something that actually is going to be healing for most people.This is not to say that everyone needs to hike 1100 miles, but it does point that the human beings tend to be happiest and healthiest when they feel empowered and able to meet challenges on their own."
