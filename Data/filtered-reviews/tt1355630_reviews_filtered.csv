" Great idea terribly executed.
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,3,"Without beating around the bush I love me a good romance and Chloe grace moretz is my favorite female actress so this movie must be great right? Unfortunately not. This movie is bad and i didn't enjoy it, here's why.The start of this film is actually half alright. Real good character development and introductions. The cast is good and their acting was decent. The duo shared a awkwardly adorable and cute new relationship but then all goes downhill after 30 mins of the film. The main duos relationship is terrible. They fight and bicker all the time and don't seem in love or remotely happy at all. There was also 0 build up and suspense. You know exactly what was gonna happen and although it did have somewhat sad parts they were too out of the blue without any build up for me to have any sort of emotion besides ""ohh that sucks"". Nothing really happens in between her being in a coma and the ending was also quite sudden with no build up so it was just a right mess.to put it in short for a sad romance there was 15% good romance mainly by the parents funnily enough. Bad suspense and no build up for you to feel overly upset at the circumstance. I would highly not suggest this Mess of a film! What a shame.."
" One of the best movies
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,8,"One of the best movies I've ever seen
I hope the directors will repeat the musical works They give a good comfortable feeling"
" Possibly the worst movie of the decade
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,1,"The end scene was so corny and cringeworthy that everyone in the theater, who had been quiet and attentive up until then, began moaning and saying things like ""oh my god"" and ""give me a break"". The sentiment of walking out in the middle of the movie was robbed due to the fact that this film bottomed out at the end."
" Fabulous
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,10,Excellent movie. Every actor/actress done fab work.
" Emergency Chloë or How else to spoil Mozart
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,5,"The film had potential, to the point where it became clear that everything was drowned in routine and cliché. A good old repeat awaited me at every next turn. Nothing in this film sounded... except for Amadeus."
" It got me
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,7,"I have a younger brother, and watching this made me feel the weight of her losses, and I LOST IT. The narration gave great back story and let you take on the perspective of the main character and empathize with her pain. SPOILER: when she lost her brother, I cried, and I don't cry in movies, like Marley and Me did nothing for me (yeah i'm heartless), but the little brother NO SIR!! Great movie especially if you need a good cry!"
" Very good
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,10,"I lost the counting of how many times I've watched it. A very good movie with a lot of messages inside. The plot may be confusing because of the throwbacks, but seriously you have to watch it!!"
" Great soundtrack
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,10,I like the bit at the start where the lion roared. Better than ghost I reckon
" Memorable Movie
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,8,"I shed a few tears on this one.The mix of music, the theme, and the fictional aspect of it has with it a touch of realism too.We all wish we could see ourselves outside our own bodies. If I stay showcases that and much more.I can remember where I watched this movie and when I watched it because it was so memorable."
" If I stay review
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,8,"This is about a girl who whole family gets into unfortunate accident. The rest of her family dies but while she in the hospital she is playing back her romance with this dude. The dude also trying to get her to stay and not died . I like the idea of the story before I watch it. When I finally sat down to watch it. The movie was better then I thought it would be. This is a sad story so make sure and have tissues at hand if you cry easily. Both of the two lovers play differnce kinds of music. The girl into more classical music while the guy more into music that you see in a band. The two characters they great chemistry together. The story plot, storyline, character development and characters were great. I am so happy that by the end of the story the choose what she thought was the best option for herself even know she was sad that her family had died. I highly recommend this story to everyone."
" Interesting, but not memorable
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,6,"This movie is pretty true to the book. You get interested without getting lost, and it's still unpredictable. But after a while, you forget about the movie. None of it sticks. Nothing life changing about it. Definitely a good watch, but not very engaging."
" A nice movie~
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,8,"I haven't read the book, and I think that it is a good thing.Story: I love this story. It is realistic and yet, it's a fantasy. Yes, I'll say that it is a fantasy because... ok, I don't want to be a spoiler :DCharacters: I like the female lead, but what took me the most is the male character. I heard he is being criticized on this film but his expressions, and emotion really gets me."
" I was on the verge of bursting out in tears throughout every minute
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,7,"I'm truly grateful for everything and everyone I have.. it's scary how in a split of a second, everything can get taken away from you.."
" Death... a metaphor for life.
",2019-07-17 00:00:00,7,"This is one of those movies where each viewer will take away a different emotion than someone else.
Life can be cruel, upsetting though it can bring you joy and happiness... this movie tries to depict all emotions that life can throw at you... your first love, true happiness that your heart doesn't want to stop beating but knowing it will as you pursue your life and passion that's the hardest battle.The real question as I am sure a lot of people were thinking it... Do she want to wake up from her coma knowing her family is dead and she has to deal with the pain, agony and anguish or does she give up and die just like her main choice in the movie... does she follow her dreams knowing it will tear her apart or does she stay knowing it will also tear her apart.
Such as death as so in life."
" Stellar Performance; Terrible Ending.
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,6,"Not to be salty, but they should have just let her die. Everything was taken from her... I didn't see the point of letting her live though"
" Really good at all
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,10,"I'm not keen on romantic movies ,but loved. It shows up pure love."
" YOU ARE EITHER GOING TO WATCH THIS FILM OR NOT
",2019-05-09 00:00:00,6,"Mia Hall (Chloë Grace Moretz) has a wonderful family, in love with Adam (Jamie Blackley) who plays in a band, and she is a candidate for Julliard. The next thing you know, she is in a coma and we all have Puff moments as she examines her life and can see what is happening in the hospital as a soul or spirit. Mia must make the mental decision to recover or move on and follow the light. With much of her life destroyed, she asks the question of what will she have ""If I Stay.""The film is filled with all the joyous melancholy of a teen girl's life (hint: target audience). For people who couldn't cry enough over ""The Fault In Our Stars"" this film is here to help wrangle that last bit of moisture from your tear duct. Mom (Mireille Enos) explains life to Mia while doing dishes and inspired the title for my review.Actors gave a good performance for a script that was a bit formulaic. Newcomer Ali Milner did an excellent job as Liz, the friend.Parental Guide: No F-bombs, or nudity. Implied sex."
" Wonderful
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,10,"It's a sentimental-love-beautiful story! i found it so lovely, it's sad but it's one of my favourite movies!!"
" Great Movie
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,8,"I personally feel that this movie is underrated. The writing is good as is the production. But what really made this movie for me was that every member of the cast really contributed so well to the overall picture. The chemistry between the 2 leads is excellent and the character, Adam has been given great lines that he nails. The whole combination draws you in with both laughter and tears. I absolutely enjoyed watching this movie with my wife. It made for a great afternoon's entertainment."
" Loved it!
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,10,"Loved it! I was so excited to see it and was there the day it came out. So sad they never made Where She Went as a film. I know that the area just a lot of walking, but I'm visual and would have liked to see it with the original actor and actress."
" Not as great as expected
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,2,Honestly it was a little boring and hard to follow
" nothing is stronger than the human spirit
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because though it is really sad it is realistic to the struggles that people in comma's go through in order to wake up. The direction and screenplay are incredible. The casting and acting are incredible also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Strong story
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,10,"Four years have gone by since I first saw this movie. And man, I still listen to the soundtrack every now and then, and just smile at how beautiful, painful, complicated and strong of a story this is. The book is to this day one of my faves, and the movie is just as good portrayed. Definitely a movie worth your time, your energy and your tears!"
" Today is the greatest Day I've ever known Can't live for tomorrow Tomorrow's much too long
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,8,"I watched the movie for the second time and really enjoyed it was very nice.
I can guarantee you will definitely cry an incredible emotional movie.
Actresses were great especially Mian's grandfather playing player was very good.love, sadness, happiness you feel each emotion separately.only some visual effects were bad because, was a low budget movie but i liked it very muchthe most beautiful side of the film was the songs used very well,
It was impressive,
I think most of the songs for this film were songs of the film."
" Not so good
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,6,"I am quite disappointed and angry. Everything is going so fast and sudden in the movie, especially the ending. The narration of the romantic part is not detailed enough. It doesn't impress me so much. I will recommend 'To All the Boys I've Loved Before' rather than this one, if you want a recent romantic movies.But, the paving of the movie is smooth. The connection between the past and the real is good. The story of Mia's family is also warm, I feel the unconditional love of them.P.S This is not worth to spend your free time on this movie."
" Yes!!
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,10,"I'm a person who doesn't cry usually at any movie, if a movie makes me cry it is going to be a good movie!! This movie brought me into tears, it was such a good movie! Other than the fact that she fought a lot with her boyfriend, the though of just us knowing that her life can change just like that is something that is great and should definitely be in a movie! I didn't think I was going to like it, but i looooooooooved it so much !!"
" Nice,Slow&Have toSee
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,9,"This movie seriously got me..
i'm sobbing...i,m still hearing ending song ....
soundtracks are the best chosen.acting was good(without some little odds)
the storytelling is nice,though it is very different from what i thought.."
" Rock n roll and party Usa.
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,1,"Liquor, rock n roll and sex, that's it. Like all others movies from Hollywood."
" Best romance, drama, musical movie i've ever watched
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,10,If u trying to find a movie to make you cry or if u feel lonely try watching this i cried everytume i watch this movie
" Decent adaption
",2018-03-03 00:00:00,5,"I really liked this book, the movie adaption is decent but honestly also pretty forgettable. Sort of along the lines of The Fault In Our Stars but not. This story follows Mia Hall after a car accident puts her in a coma. Through flashbacks we reflect on her life while she decides whether or not to wake up and face her new reality. Most of this story is told through flashbacks; to her sweet loving, meant to be hip parents, her little brother, her (endless) cello playing and her up and down relationship with the popular, older bad boy from the band who for some reason has fallen for... her. Mia gets accepted to Juilliard, her boyfriend goes on tour, Stacy Keach is her grandfather, Mia roams the hospital and her memories with endless musical interludes including cello recitals and watching her dreamy boyfriend play in bars. I found the music too much in this, with entire songs shown when little bits would have been fine. Enjoyed Mireille Enos as the cool mom even if the family ws portrayed a little TOO perfect.Definitely preferred the book on this one."
" What would you sacrifice for your art?
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,7,"This film was not supposed to be as good as it was. I expected to be disappointed, but I can say I was impressed and moved deeply. So what if her face (Moretz) was digitally imposed on a real cellist. Moretz did take lessons, but was not screen ready. I respect that sort of commitment to a part. I've played for 30 years, so I know the time needed exhibit such bow control. (We did see the orignal baroque bowing of the Prelude) A teenage romance that ends too soon for their teenage hearts. The boy is destructive and the girl is a loner, but music brings them together. Reminded me of August Rush, just with teens. We can experience the awkwardness of teen romance that appears to be true love. Regardless, this is more than a film about teens in love, far more. We learn of the sacrifice a family makes for their children, for music. The film is emotional, yes, verily, with a simple storyline, so be ready to enjoy this film once, and leave it there. It is simply too dramatic, too close to the heart, to heavy to watch on repeat. With that said, it is a beautiful film, perfectly packaged for an ""Insta-gratification Generation"" while appealing to Xennials and Milenials alike. And it is all tied together with good music: Saint-Saëns Concerto N°1, Beethoven Cello Sonata N°3 in A Major, and the Kodály Solo Sonata. We enjoy the Kodály twice and quite prominently actually. We witness the only ever cello audition, ever in a film. We are with Mia and her family as they record her audition, and we witness the importance of a little brother's encouragement. I know what that is like because I lived Mia's life, sans the romance. My family believed in me, encouraged me, stood backstage and gave in-car pep talks. They let me wander off and listen to the 3rd Beethoven, for months as I dreamed of a music school in California. I experienced that same ""out-of-body"" feeling Mia felt during her in-person audition. I know what it is like to play your guts out and leave it all on the stage. And I know the joy of winning that audition too. :-)I am a cellist, who song writes on guitar, who lost a father to brain cancer, who auditioned for uni and WON with the same Beethoven A Major Sonata Mia loves so much. Music has brought me back to so many times, and cello is always bring me closer to my late father. Plus, my family owned a green Ford Taurus wagon, and I love the Smashing Pumpkins."
" Breathtaking
",2018-01-30 00:00:00,10,A story about true unconditional love that can bring you back to life! A must-watch tittle!
" Good but slow and repetitive
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,7,"Overall the movie is worth a good 7/10 , story is really slow and is mostly consisting of flash backs and a love story between a young couple , it kinda fails to deliver until the end which honestly got a few tears from me as i thought it was really cute and emotional. Still doesnt deserve more than 7/10 on my end , but still a good watch anyway. Recommended if you like ""young couple"" lovestories."
" Best Movie Ever
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,10,This makes me cry every time- whoever doesn't feel inspired has no heart! Chloe Moretz's acting is impeccable. I was so surprised at how well she acted out Mia's passion (The cello). This movie is the perfect balance between a romantic movie and a drama movie. All the important things in Mia's life add up and cause her to stay. It goes to show that you don't always need a real family to have a great life! Again- so inspirational!
" Helpful in my real life
",2017-11-03 00:00:00,10,"Over a period of three years, every member of my family died -- along with my best friend. I, of course, fell into a depression I am still recovering from.It was during a particularly difficult time that I sought counseling services, but they spent my hourly allotment testing me for some mental illness, which I knew I didn't have... So it came down to me deciding whether to continue or whether to quit that I happened to turn on my television set in the process of showing this movie... This movie showed me that at some time in the ""eternity,"" I chose this... I CHOSE THIS!!And when this young girl has her breakthrough, I did, too! They want me to stay...Anyone giving this movie a down thumb... hasn't been in this situation yet.For me, it was a life saver!"
" 10/10
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a great movie. I'm not a fan of drama movies, but this movie was amazing. It's worth seeing!I'm happy because I saw it, and I not regret it. This movie made me see the world more beautiful and love my family and friends for as long as I can. The conclusion is that this film is worth seeing, not just for action but also for the wonderful actors who made this film a masterpiece."
" A great idea with an implied predictable finale
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,8,"Mia Hall, a very talented cello player has a lot of problems on her mind regarding her future as a musician, her family and her boyfriend, but nothing compares to what she's about to experience. She's faced with a near death situation which brings her into a position from where she can relive the most important moments of her life and try to choose a path of life or death. Tragedies come, one after another, making her decision harder, but her entire future is solely up to her.It's an interesting idea of a state of trance in which you can have some flashbacks and figure out what you're going to do with your life, studying the present at the same time. Unfortunately, from my point of view, I simply cannot find the problem in this situation. I cannot think of a person who would actually choose to die instead of continuing his life, no matter how hard it seemed to be ahead. With life, you're not given a second chance. You live or it's game over. And with this said, there comes this movie's predictability which kind of spoils the finale. Besides this, it is exactly what you would expect from this type of movie. Dramatic and sad but also romantic and emotional. You feel sorry for her numerous times, and that is a good thing, especially as she is faced with more and more difficulties. Fortunately, she gets a great dose of encouragements from her close ones, making her decision somewhat easier.It is a good movie but unfortunately it fails to do something that truly impresses you, something to make you suddenly burst into tears, facts which I consider a must have in this kind of films."
" Another revolution of a young adult novel made into film
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,7,"What would you do if your entire immediate family perished in a car crash? Would you choose to live or follow the light?That is the decision Mia is grappling with in her out of body experience.I take umbrage with several of the plot points though. The weather is sooo bad they cancel school, but the family decides to go out in their car sledding? WTH? See also not much snow on the ground when everyone arrives at the hospital!?Despite all that it was an enjoyable movie!"
" Just Avoid It!!
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,2,"I can't believe I wasted my evening on this. An immature story good enough only for girls below twelve years of age. I wonder why Hollywood likes to glorify self-centered annoying little girls who only complain about everything and the only purpose of other people's existence is to comfort them. I guess the industry needs us, girls, as needy as possible and this is its way of brainwashing us. T'was boring, stupid and pointless. I gave it a two because the first 10 minutes, the whole punk rock family with the cello lover daughter looked pretty interesting; could've been an interesting movie as well, but it was a big torturesome bore, hungry for money."
" Seems A Bit Gimmicky
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,4,"After loving the roles that Chloe Grace Moretz played in ""Carrie"" & ""The Equalizer"", I decided to give this one a shot after recently having watched (and enjoyed more than I thought) a similar teen drama in ""The Fault In Our Stars"". Unfortunately, I felt that this one was kind of based on a gimmick.For a basic plot summary, ""If I Stay"" tells the story of Mia (Moretz), a high school girl who plays a beautiful cello. This musical talent gets her noticed by cute guy Adam (Jamie Blackley) and she is awaiting a letter from Juilliard's music program. On a seemingly normal family drive, however, Mia is involved in a car crash putting the entire family in the hospital. As ""physical Mia"" fights for her life in the hospital, ""spirit Mia"" watches the action unfold as a kind of ghost entity, trying to discover what is happening to her and her family members. Many moments of the previous year are flashed-back to as Mia discovers what is really important in her life.The main problem with this film is that it seems to be based on what I consider to be a very gimmicky concept, that being ""spirit Mia"" watching herself (and her family) in the hospital interspersed with flashbacks. What purpose did that serve in the film besides to give Moretz more time to act? It all could have been done with Mia just laying in her hospital bed. All that would have been missed was a few reaction shots.Couple that with the fact that the story here didn't strike me as particularly strong to begin with. Maybe if one appreciates cello music more than I do, or is a sucker for sad movies, they will find more significance here, but I never felt that what I was watching made the jump from ""contrived"" to ""real"".The highlights? Moretz is still great in her role (as convoluted as it may be sometimes), while a grandfather character (played by Stacy Keach) practically steals the show with ever scene he is in. In a movie that should be filled with such emotion, it is telling that a guy on the screen in a very limited role has such an impact.Thus, while I know I shouldn't directly compare this to ""Fault In Our Stars"", it just so happens that I saw both within about a two-week span. ""Fault"" made me actually care about what was going on and drew me in. ""Stay""...not so much. At times I even got a little bored waiting for something to happen. Like I said, Chloe Grace Moretz is still solid, but it isn't enough to inject life into this vehicle."
" I shouldn't have stayed either
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,6,"I am livid about this movie! I can't get the time I spent watching it back. The beginning of the movie was whatever. It was full of clichés and eyeroll moments. However, the movie grew up a bit. Chloe's character slowly became less annoying and the movie lost a bit of its pretentiousness. HOWEVER, the end of the movie was absolute garbage. The entire movie makes you invested in the relationship between Adam and Mia, then it puts a gun in your face and pulls the trigger. Spoiler: at the end of the movie, Mia decides to wake up, despite losing her whole family. And for what? For her first love, who acted like a stubborn idiot until she was on her deathbed. Yes, he was only happy about her fulfilling her dreams when she was literally dying. This movie is PATHETIC."
