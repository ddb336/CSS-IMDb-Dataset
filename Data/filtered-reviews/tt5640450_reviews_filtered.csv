" Time just stands still
",2021-04-05 00:00:00,4,The movie never moves forward. Rachel Taylor has far too many clothes on for this level of repetition. He should have let her die and turned off the machine. If the loops go on in a circle then the outside world war has already been won.
" This movie is infuriating
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,1,"Only watch if your plan is to get angry. The quantity of stupid decisions in this movie are unreal, there is no way in the world someone can be this stupid. I don't even know how i managed to watch it to the end, but seriously, the male lead character makes the same mistake over and over and over again.Just don't waste your time watching this trash."
" ARQ delivers
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,8,"Some guy wakes up on the bed next to his girlfriend. Seconds later some masked guys break though the door and take the two to the basement and tie them to chairs. While the bad guys grab something to eat, the guy, Renton, frees himself, frees the girl but is eventually killed by the bad guys. Then he wakes up again in the bedroom as before and the cycle repeats itself, albeit a little different. By the third time he starts regaining memories of the previous loops. There's a surprise regarding the girl. Hannah. The bad guys are after his money, or. Whatever the name if the currency now is. See, this is in the future after some environmental catastrophe. Air is impure so people need airmasks. Food is hard to come by. And the world is run by some evil corporation called Torus. But there's also a resistance move and Hannah is part of it.Renton doesn't just have money and food. He also has developed a perpetual motion/infinite energy machine. It's spinning in his basement. He used to work for Torus but isn't anymore yet took the machine with him. Torus of course wants the machine back, which would give them even more control.In new loops Renton and Hannah try to fight back and grow savyer every time. But the end tends to be the same. Then they realize the main bad guy is also starting to remember and is also responding to their improvising. The question is can they survive long enough to break out of the eternal return of the same? There are a couple of surprises along the way.ARQ, like most sci-fi movies manages to deliver more than expected. Sci-fi has become my favorite genre. Even though most sci-fi movies are lower budget they are usually well-made and the stories offer way more than your standard billion dollar budget action/thriller/drama movie. ARQ worked, even though the premise is familiar. It offers enough to surprise and the cast does solid work."
" Has potential, but goes nowhere.
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,3,"I watched the first 20mins and In that time, I knew enough about the development of this film. I applaud the team for trying to develop a film around time loops, but this one lacks thought in the story and character development. Maybe it was a bad choice of actors, or maybe the team was trying to work with what they had, but I knew in the first 5 minutes that the supporting character was suspect just by the way she was over acting her part. The concept was a good idea, but the execution was just not there. It seems like the director focused to much on non-essentials. If its a story about saving the world then focus on on that, don't focus to much on the relationship aspects of the couple."
" Just another movie that fails at the end
",2021-02-25 00:00:00,5,"OK, I have now watched about half a dozens new films that have open endings with NO real resolution. ARQ is the latest failure by another filmmaker who couldn't be bothered to think of a smart ending. It seems to be a trend lately - leave the ending of a film completely open so the filmmakers ""SEEM"" to be clever. It's NOT. Why would anyone want to waste their time and money getting emotionally invested in ANY characters and then having zero to almost-zero emotional payoff at the end. It is unfortunate as I really liked the movie and thought the play on the time loop scenario was unique, but spoiled in the last five seconds. ALSO - this is ANOTHER time loop movie - it also seems to be a trend - so if you're a filmmaker - just make a movie with a time loop and don't have an intelligent ending and you'll fit in with the new popular trend."
" Another unfair 6
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,9,"I am putting out reviews since only a few days ago and it all started with the many movies i nearly avoided because of the low stars some movies have and do not reflect the movie at all.
This is yet another case ! First of all, i didnt even notice the time flying. Captivating and interesting concept of a movie(not original of course but what is original nowadays..) and i will leave the review spoiler free so i wont continue getting into this one.
Good acting - very good acting actually. Good setup, good plot with an ending that fits the whole idea of the movie - spot on - even if predictable to a certain extent.
I DO recommend this movie if only for the fact that i did not wanted it to stop when it did.
If something, this demonstrates again that a good script does not need tens or hundreds of millions to get it right. Low budget, good plot, decent twists that kept you interested all movie long. Just GOOD overall.Please give it a try without looking too much at the number of stars. It for sure doesnt reflect the truth.
Solid 7.5, towards 8. I am gonna leave a 9 for the haters."
" This moview goes nowhere
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,5,"This was a big disappointment. Normally I love time travelling movies, but I really wish I could go back in time one and a half hour and tell myself not to waste time on this one.The backstory is nonexistent, the characters are unlikable, the plot goes nowhere. Literally - you will find yourself not caring about what happens to any of the characters, and that the plot is just one boring loop that never progresses and becomes more interesting than the first time around.Seriously, don't waste your time. If you want to see a decent time travelling B-movie then go watch Timetrap."
" not good, even when you turn off your brain
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,3,"This movie IS NOT about time travel. This movie IS NOT science fiction. This movie is a weak romance story set in a dystopian world. I don't care about the plot holes this movie has, i care about the inconsistencies in character this movie keeps illustrating.The movie started off decent enough. The premise seemed interesting. But the minute the first loop occurs problems in the script start arising that never really get fixed further on into the movie.My biggest problem with the movie was that the main character guy was simping so hard over his ex-girlfriend it was gross and not warranted at all. SHE EVEN KILLS HIM AT ONE POINT and he is still like ""i can trust her"". Like, what?? No. NO?! Not only that, but his ex-gf is now in this group, is a leader of some type, and is now dating another guy. She keeps seeing her ""boyfriend"" getting killed and her other colleagues and SHOWS NO EMOTION. She is a complete psychopath!!! And her ex is still there with her every step of the way, even tho she has never proven herself to be trust worthy. She keeps not following his orders, she does what she wants, and she often thwarts his plans; even tho he has her best interest in mind. She never shows she cares, until the end or something, i don't know.It seems this script was sloppily written, by 6 different people, with no attention to detail at all. Sloppy, boring, and inconsistent. Would not recommend. You're better off watching a brain dead movie like the Hangover series, at least they are somewhat entertaining despite their major plot holes."
" A decent timeloop movie
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,6,"This is a decent and definitely watchable movie with a good cast and a well thought out script. As with all movies where the creators play with the timefactor, it's easy to criticise the impossiblities, but in respect to this, the movie is played out well. It has a good atmosphere, it plays out on one location and keeps you interested till the, sudden, end. Nice musicscore and overall a fun (little) movie."
" Great suspensefull movie!
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,8,"Kept me hooked every second, didn't expect to be this captivating."
" There are a lot of reviews
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,9,"Basically, the movie ended at 1:07 and then continued on with a past timeline and yeah, a lot of people got it and a lot of people didn't. Some of those who got it are positive about it, some are not. That's okay.Personally I loved it (not as crazy as that Predestination loop but definitely beats Groundhog Day). And I actually would positively like to believe it is not as loopy (pardon the pun) as it seems.The final video at 1:24 is cut off with slightly more footage. Maybe it was meant to convey the full video that was cut off at 1:07, showing how this is an infinite loop they cannot escape from. Yet I am hopeful that when Hannah wakes up first in the next iteration, they might have made slightly more progress than the last 9 loops of iteration.I gave this a 9* rating because nothing beats Predestination, no matter how loopy it gets."
" New rule: Don't make a damn movie if you don't have an idea for an ending!
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,3,"The movie overall is good. Story, characters, production all good. The glaring issue here is that the writers decided to cop out and not finish the story. It's about a time loop. The characters reliving the same few hours over and over. The movie ends with just another loop beginning. Roll credits. Why? If they had a legitimate reason I'd like to hear it."
" Annoyng
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,3,Most annoying movie ever.0 budget.do not reccoend to anyone
" Low budget but not bad.
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,6,"ARQ must have a relatively low budget since almost the entire movie is filmed in the same room but nevertheless it's entertaining. There's constant action and the acting isn't bad and that from the whole cast. It's a bit like Groundhog Day but with a sci-fi touch and although the story is quite complicated, and that even if you pay good attention, it's still interesting to follow. The images are of good quality, they clearly know what they're doing. ARQ is worth a watch if you're into this genre of movies, action/sci-fi that is."
" Just stupid characters
",2020-10-02 00:00:00,1,"During the entire movie, the male lead got screwed by the actress nonsense."
" Spoiler alert
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,1,"First minute knew lead actress was against lead role, her ideals to win against CMP the corporation that runs the world. To be the guy that invented a time machine, he isnt very bright. Very basic to destroy the universe instead lets keep repeatin hoping to do what exactly? An idiot with a time machine = a sad movie and poor writing."
" I hate time loop movies
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,2,"Low budget. I mean, really, _really_ low. The same activities by the same characters, over and over again. ""Reveals"" which are not at all surprising. ""Science"" which is anything but. I kept looking at the clock and wondering if this flick was ever coming to a conclusion, which it doesn't in the end -- it just loops. Really, that's all it does.Stay far away."
" Do not watch it with high expectations due to all these +ve reviews
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,3,"Do not watch it with high expectations due to all these +ve reviews. Bcoz if u do, then you'll not like it just like me. I'm a hard movie lover and have watched lot of time loop movies. Among all of them, this is one of the slowest. Means for me, i felt it boooring with too much repetition scenes... I suggest u go watch the movie Source code instead of watching this one"
" I think no one went to actor school for this one
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,4,"Unnatural, stale and predictable. Looks like the screenwriter borrowed from few good movies with similar concept. Actors feel like they are reading from a book instead of acting. Good pace though.Please stop Netflix movies infestation!!!!!!!!"
" Hannah is an annoying idiot
",2020-08-06 00:00:00,7,She's proven wrong over and over and then she says trust me lol. Girl you are in no position to talk
" wait a minute, I have seen this before
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,6,"Normally I could dig scifi flicks with a twist and this one surely has that but somehow I lost my grip on it. It's full of , i, fact, it's all about time lapses and that makes it interesting but guess I have seen it all before in other flicks.Is it the fact that it's all about how to survive in a lapse and how to keep the ARQ save that I thought, yeah, okay , and how many times this will happen again?Made 2 years after the smash hit, Edge Of Tomorrow, same thing, live, die , repeat...
Gore 1/5

" Wish there was either a series for this or a sequel
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,10,Not a lot of films do what this one did and it payed off well. I loved every part of it and i urge you to go watch it for yourself!
" It's decent if you turn off your brain
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,6,"This film is ok for what it is. Well acted and well shot on an obviously low budget. The time loop stuff is messy and not really explained well. Anyways from the gist of the film It seems they never escape the loop because they'll always be reset and make the video. Also, I fail to see how the time machine would help in a war if it can 1. Only loop over and over and 2. Only loop a limited space. In the film they say time has only been looping in the circle.So now I have to ask if time has only been looping for them then isn't the war already lost as they have been in the loop for thousands and thousands of loops while time outside has passed? Or does time reset everywhere to the original day once they escape the loop? The time loop HAS to be affecting things outside the circle because every loop one guy is always calling in backup and they keep coming every loop. If these reinforcements keep coming then they also have to be stuck in the loop which contradicts the circle theory. Like I said time is messy in films."
" Another Groundhog Day... but quite well done
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,8,"Yes it's using the tired trope of time loop (especially in sci-fi); not a spoiler by the way, they make it clear in the first 2 minutes of the movie. That said, they use the mechanics very well and manage to have an interesting plot that keeps you engaged from beginning to end. Acting is also pretty good for this type of movie. It reminds me of good sci-fi movies like Cube or Coherence, where they create something really great in a closed setting with minimal budget. That's a great movie on its own and I really hope they don't ruin it by trying to make an ""ARQ 2 - now we make it dumb and happy""..."
" Plot hole
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,5,"The movie was progressing nicely, but the ""plot twist"" made a plot hole that made me question the writing."
" Hummm
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,5,I'll I can say is hummm. If your stuck inside and running out of things to watch it's worth a try. However there seems to be a lot of pointless hints which lead know where and become pretty pointless once you reach the end of the film. And the ending doesn't really answer any questions which can be good in some cases however in this case a hint to the ending would of made watching 5 people fight for 2 hours as reason. If your like myself you've just watched the same room and still have no idea what this film was about. Wouldn't watch again
" Sorry bruv, it's just not great....
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,5,"This is quite possibly the slowest burn of a film I have ever seen. It is reminiscent of a video game that you used to play: initially you don't get past the end of level one; then you progress slowly but surely through the game learning from your mistakes, though frequently having to start again from scratch.... Well this is one of them, with Robbie Amell and Rachael Taylor caught in a time loop that gradually reveals a story of betrayal and duplicity as they try to protect a gizmo that might just be the answer to humanity's energy problems from ""Torus"", a company that wants it too. Unfortunately, and as usual for Amell, this is a rather dry, uninteresting piece of drama - neither character really has any depth; the dialogue and effects are repetitive and all in all it amounts to little more than a digital ""Groundhog Day"" with apples and fisticuffs."
" Booring
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,1,Main characters are definitely stupid. They did every mistake they can. He is genius that can invite time machine but also he is really stupid that repeat same mistakes over and over again.
" A Boring Waste of Time
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,3,"Do not watch thus pablum. At best, it is annoying; at worst, a total time waster. I would rather watch clothes dry."
" Interesting concept
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,7,"An enjoyable low budget sci-fi thriller. ARQ makes all the moves of a good low budget movie, keep the sets simple and the cast minimal. The acting was good from the while cast and the characters developed. the concept was really interesting and the storyline unfolded unexpectedly throughout the re-sets. An enjoyable movie."
" Great idea, badly realised
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,5,"I loved the whole idea of this, but halfway through it got quite confusing as to quite what was going on.
Who had killed who had woken back up etc, and quite frankly I got bored of the constant 'reboots' each one adding a new level of complexity to an already confusing plot.
By the last 1/4 I had totally lost interest and only half watched it anyway."
" Little Sci-Fi, Too Much Drama
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,3,"Wants to be a science fiction movie, but the script was written by someone who must have lost a love and wants a retry.Too many scenes where the protagonists should be running/fearing for their lives are spent rehashing, arguing over stupid stuff. It is almost like you are about to be killed and your partner asks if you turned off the bathroom light...then wants to walk in that direction of danger to verify....yes there is almost that level of stupidity here.50-year old logical thinking male...this movie is a big no."
" Nope for Netflix.
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,2,"I'm a 42 year old lady. (You should have to mention this. An 18 year old gamer boy is not going to say the same.) I like everything that is not condescending and predictable so....
If you've seen a lot of movies of this genre then do you really need to see 2 kids playing in one room for over an hour? The acting is like what you may get in a casting call, which us too bad because Robbie does all right in Code 8. It's Groundhog's day without the jokes and without Bill Murray. Not even sexy. There's no point. Plus the ARQ looks way too much like a high tech photo scanner from back in the early 2000s. Funny."
" Loved the idea
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,6,"Good: story, direction, acting
Bad : climax, screenplay.
The movie could have been better if they ended it well instead on question mark"
" What a rush!
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,9,I didn't think I would like another time loop movie. But they did it. OMG! This is a little gem. Soooo well done. The actors are perfect and the script felt fresh and new. They managed to create a new way to exploit the concept. I don't understand the people who are complaining about the budget... I never felt that it was a low budget movie... not a second.
" Utter crap
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,1,"I have seen Edge of Tomorrow and this too is in the same genre but that was really fun to watch. The repeated scenes didn't bore me out in edge of tomorrow while this bore me out just after the 2nd loop.
Don't really know why this movie was even made."
" Not Bad, But Could've Ended Better
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,5,"This 2016 sci-fi thriller tells about a couple who find themselves caught in a time loop where a group of thugs break in and one of them is trying to steal a
energy source/time machine. This isn't bad, but it could've ended better, but
I like the score and the ""Groundhog Day"" scenario. Give this a try if you're into sci-fi or thrillers."
" So so poor
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,3,The actors themselves didn't do much wrong pretty average but the main problem was just the story wasn't great at all and the script just as bad. I didn't care for either side of the story and only just kept going in hope of atleast knowing some sort of conclusion but apparently that was to much to ask also. One of the worst films I've watched in a long time.
" Fills like watching 8th episode of a low budget serie
",2020-01-07 00:00:00,3,"So much information mentioned about past events (that nobody have any idea), war that is happening (with no details), etc. Dozen questions that not even worth answering because movie is bad. No data, no clear story, no ending. Waiting for nothing...
I love all sci-fi movies about future. That wasn't the one."
" Boring low budget movie
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,2,"A repeating over and over story. It manages to keep you interested until you get tired and you wanna skip to the end. Finally the movie ends without ending the story just another repeat... absolute waste of time, another netflix crap."
" Goodish movie. Not bad.
",2019-10-18 00:00:00,7,"Pretty good, could have used a change if scenery every once in a while but I guess that would have been difficult to incorporate in this movie timeline."
" Most Forward
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,6,"Excellent thought provoking movie .Viewers are left puzzled thinking who was the most forward in time person in that loop was that Anna ,you partner only knows about the loop and time machine when shot.."
" A piece of garbage
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,1,"Netflix always fascinates me with her low level of films , it's unbelievably baaaad movie."
" I'm a sucker for time travel movies. Oh an I am a big Rachael Taylor fan !
",2019-09-12 00:00:00,7,"I'll make this clear from the get-go. I'm a sucker for time travel movies. Primer, BTTF trilogy, Time Crimes, Terminator, Butterfly Effect, even Groundhog Day.This is a commendable addition to the genre. I won't go into plot specifics because the less you know the better. The movie doesn't waste any time, pun intended, getting started. It twists and turns, repeating itself and progressing further along the time line, offering up more information each pass, without getting stuck covering the same ground.The acting is solid, the plot is interesting, the dialogue well written and it's fluidly directed. The score is effective and it looks stylish.I would definitely recommend it if you like time travel movies and can suspend your disbelief. If you are one of those people that pick every little thing apart, I wouldn't bother seeing this (but that goes for a lot of movies!)."
" One of the better Netflix Movies!!!
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,7,"I'll be honest Netflix has some great movies and shows and it has some awful ones. This one luckily does not fall on the latter, but still isn't the best they have. I'll say this, it at least has some twist and turns and keeps you engaged... Time loop movies can get complicated and this one does a DECENT job at not getting to confusing. Definitely would only recommend this if your board and want a decent flick..."
" Nothing Happens In the End
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,4,"First allthe good reviews here, makes you wanna watch it.
You watch it and you wait something to happen during the entire film.
It ends and leaves with you a dissatisfaction.
Does not worth an hour and a half because you even don't get an ending after that time waste.
Nonsense."
" I have only enjoyed the end.
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,6,"The beggining really sticks you to the screen, because you are trying to understand what's going on.But, unfortunatly, the development is very slow, repetive and honestly just boring.
It could have been an amasing moovie.I only don't give this a 5, because the end is great. Very nice twist, very unespected."
" good solid film
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,8,"Well acted, interesting plot, lots of twisting time travel. what is not to like. Very enjoyable."
" Passive-aggressive people you don't care about.
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,1,"Someone took the story of Groundhog Day, threw out everything good (variety of characters, environment, funny moments, etc) and stuck in panicked whispering passive-agresssive actors and called it a day.You don't care about anyone in the film - whether they live or die, so why continue to watch and see what happens?"
" When the scriptwriter is trapped in a timeloop...
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,3,"Actors can do one expression only.
Script is full of plot holes.
Characters do dumb stuff all the time.
""This action will result in a bad outcome? Better do it anyway.""
""We are in a timeloop and I could try something different? Better repeat everything word for word.""
""I repeated this bad action 10 times now, got the same bad result every single time and movie is already hitting the 90 minute-mark? Better restart the movie and call it a day!""Yeah right, such a genius masterpiece..."
" I didn't like this movie at all
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,3,"I didn't enjoy at all watching this movie! It's really low budget movie and the idea is not that good. I didn't like the end at all, what's the point of all this movie if the end is that they are going to try again and again ?
I watch this movie based on the good reviews here on Imdb, and now I'm even shocked that a lot of people wrote a good review here for this movie!!"
" Sci-Fi addict
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,4,"In as much as I love Sci-fi and in as much this movie was promising till the very end and failed badly at the end.
Feels like the writer was too exhausted to put any effort in the ending or crew run out of fundings.Good movie overall with no ending.
Dissatisfied."
" Rivetting, gripping, and an amazing twist at the end
",2019-04-03 00:00:00,8,"Okay, while I am certainly the last to criticise Groundhog Day, and its more action orientated sister Edge of Tomorrow, there is something about this particular film that surprises me that it is as recent as it actually is. Okay, the fact that I have mentioned a couple of films that are very well known for the fact that a time loop plays a significant role in the plot should give you a really good idea about what is install for you here. However there is a pretty big catch - this is a low budget film.
Okay, just because a film is low budget doesn't necessarily mean that it is good, but then again it doesn't necessarily mean that it is bad either. However, the thing with low budget films is that for them to work well there needs to be a lot more of a focus on the story than on, well, the special effects, or even the actors. Actually, actors are probably one of the most expensive aspect of a film, so when you see a film, like this one, that basically only has a handful of people appearing in it, that is basically why.Yeah, this is a film about a time loop, but it is also a film that has a really good story to it, and a really interesting twist at the end. Actually, that is the key to this film - the twist, which I won't go and reveal because that would basically ruin a pretty good film. However, what we have is a guy who wakes up and discovers that he is being raided by guys looking for money - oh, and it is also set in a post-apocalyptic world. Like a lot of these films, a lot of it involves him attempting to maneuver a time loop based on his memory of previous events - however, there is a catch, which I won't spoil in this particular case.As I mentioned, don't expect anything flash, but do expect a pretty riveting story that doesn't necessarily follow what one would expect if one had seen the two previous greats - but that is how a film like this succeeds - it needs to be different, and the great thing about films like this, particularly low budget films, is that the imagination that goes into bringing about the twists and turns that make up the plot is what keeps us glued right through to the riveting end. This is certainly one of those films, and also one of the great things about the internet that it is able to bring your attention to such films as well."
" Entertaining but not quite perfect
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,7,"Compared to a lot of the other stuff out there, Arq is entertaining to watch. It's an interesting take on time travel I haven't seen before, insofar as there is not only one person who remembers what happened, but memories of past cycles come back to the other characters as well.There are some things that could have been done better, but one only notices that afterwards, so that's fine with me.I don't think the end is particularly unsatisfying, just like in real life not all lose ends are tied. Who cares."
" If you're into time-movies, you're gonna love this!
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,8,"The true definition of time loop! Didn't see that coming but this movie rocked! Great, well organised loops with meaning, sequence, purpose while star's behavior changes... Kinda endless, the way it supposed to be! Good acting and small but decent directing! Give it a chance you won't regret it!"
" A Small Package Overflowing with Goodies
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,10,"I'm a massive fan of time travel or time loop movies, but whenever I watched the trailer for ARQ on Netflix I kept deciding to give it a miss. The trailer made it pretty obvious that this was a time loop movie with the protagonist trying to figure things out at each loop. Yawn! Or so I thought.Finally I thought I'd stick it on and see how it goes and within 10 minutes I was thouroughly gripped.Arq takes place within a limited time span of a few hours, not even an entire day. It takes place in one single cramped location and with a handful of characters. It shows no background building up to the main story line, yet within those constraints of time, space and characters manages to build a deep, convincing and engaging tale that kept me hooked from beginning to the end. You end up not only watching events unfolding on the screen but also trying to figure stuff out like the protagonist.ARQ is not a faultless movie, but given what it achieves overall the few shortcomings can easily be overlooked. ARQ is relentless in it's storytelling and plot development and doesn't let up from the first scene till the last."
" Nearly!!!
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,10,I nearly missed out on this through bad reviews so please stop reviewing films and shows I'm going to watch this very soon so il give full review when I do
" Small-cost, secret-room science fiction
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,6,"Small-cost, secret-room science fiction. Unfortunately, there are not too many innovations in setting and plot. Actors, especially supporting actors, do not have too much sense of existence, and male and female principals are only qualified performances."
" Long wait for nothing
",2019-02-08 00:00:00,1,The word of the day is monotonous. Who are these two factions fighting over the world? And this one guy built a time machine/endless power machine? There are so many holes in the story and they hope to hold your interest with this time loop that eventually goes nowhere and never ends. This movie is a waste of time. Some people say give it a chance but there are so many other movies that are much better and worth your time. This one is not
" Definitely worth a watch
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Ignore the negative reviews and if you want an enjoyable and satisfying watch then see this movie. The story changes and keeps you interested at all times. we dont have to get everything technically right, right? We want to enjoy an evening watching a movie :)"
" Give it a go
",2018-12-21 00:00:00,7,"So much better that you may expect from the ""glow"" (by that I mean the contradiction of the cast having perfect teeth, fresh outfits and men's health front page beard stubble against the backdrop of a post-apocalyptic planet) of the film ... If you like your time paradox flicks (Edge of tomorrow / Triangle / Time Crimes) then this low budget flick is well worth a spin."
" Interesting, well shot, poorly executed
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,6,"You know how you watch a movie and you say ""why didn't they just....?"" Well, this movie illicits that question about 100 times. I really dislike having to ask myself that question at movies.
That said, it was a good idea. Maybe a great idea for a series. As for the ending, i just don't expect endings in movies anymore. They almost never have them. Not a good movie if you like closure. It's like the writers run out of ideas so they just end things."
" Pathetic beyond imagination
",2018-12-08 00:00:00,2,"Take one charisma less Robbie Amell and one Rachel Taylor with all of expressions and emotions of Kristen Stewart, add an open ended plot, remove any character or scene development and finally sprinkle SciFi junk which makes less sense thank any other movie I can think of, ever.The movie is horriblle with no plot progression and contradictions of its own set rules till literally to the very last scene. The love chemistry between the protagonists was like sodium in water and not in a fun way.I'd have given the movie 1 star, but it gets two for realistic depiction of the gore scenes and blood."
" Worth watching.
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,7,Probably won't watch again but it was worth the first viewing.
" TRASH MOVIE
",2018-10-23 00:00:00,1,"Honestly I don't do reviews but this movie was so bad and made me so mad I had to do one. First Hannah back stabs the main character multiple times but yet he still tries to help her, also the movie is just an endless loop with no real meaning there's no end goal and when the movie ends it still makes no sense. Hands down one of the worst Netflix movies I've ever seen"
" Woman screws everything up
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,3,"This is a lot like that tom cruise movie where he just keeps dying repeatedly EXCEPT nothing is ever accomplished during the hour and a half you watch this movie. There is no progress.What there is however, is a woman who is constantly getting everyone killed by either scheming, being a dumbass, or being emotional. This movie should be called thousands of death by dumb woman."
" Gripping and Thrilling - This is why I watch movies!
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,7,"I found this on Netflix because my preferences are mostly sci fi, action and thrillers. But I did not expect to be sitting on the edge of my chair for the whole movie judging by either the reviews or ratings. This is why I barely trust new movies or ratings. That's why I thoroughly enjoy 80s horror comedies and slashers... because you almost always know what to expect. I did not expect to be writing a review and recommending this to anyone who enjoys a good, thrilling plot with a few twists and turns you DEFINITELY WON'T EXPECT! Whatever you've read or heard, if it's not positive, don't mind it. This is a low-budget sci-fi thriller that will not bring anything particularly new to the table, but the execution is marvelous. It was shot one a single location in Canada and cost under $2 million to make, but if you are a fan of gripping story lines and a big reveal at the end that won't spoil anything, you will enjoy the heck out of it. I definitely enjoyed that the exposition comes off more naturally than in 90% of all movies. The director/screen writer understands that his audience isn't mentally handicapped and leaves some for them to get on their own, but leaves nothing unclear. This is basically Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow, but you never really know what will happen, and the stakes are actually really high. In most movies today you KNOW who will survive and who not, and here, well, let's just say you will always be a bit surprised.Movies with amazing screenplays and visionary directors tend to be real gems, and this is a real diamond in a sea of turds. If a big studio can spend $250 mil. on a movie that looks horrid and has an even worse story, then you should start paying attention to smaller scale projects like this. If these movies don't continue to be made, you will only get Marvel and DC/Sony superhero crap that doesn't feed your inner thirst for exploring new worlds. This is WHY is watch movies, to be surprised, to be amazed, to be perplexed at the end, and to want more. I rarely get chills from new movies nowadays, but I can only recommend you give it a go on Netflix and support similar project in cinemas as soon as they're released. Or else the companies that only make movies to place products will win and make one POS after another, and you'll be doomed to rewatch the same old gems ad nauseam."
" Infuriatingly cliche (read: stupid)
",2018-09-06 00:00:00,1,"I accidentally clicked near to the ned of the movie, when after a moment the girl keep shoting toward a steel door. I immediately wonder why would she do that...Then a moment later, the guy in the middle of seemly utter important message suddenly distracted and jump over to fight along the girl, against monster robot bare handed; I asked some kind of rethorical questioan again, why did he do that?Turn out those kind cliches (or more accurately: stupidities) are slipped everywhere in this movie, in fact many of those cliches are used to managed the plot itself.It's like being inanely lied/cheated and you know that you're being cheated."
" Can't believe I fell got reviews!
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,2,Well I looked at reviews and it seemed like a promising movie. We watched it with a girlfriend and behind this stupid movie I had to watch the main actress mess everything up over and over again and delusional guy always trusting her even though he saw how stupid she is. The ending I was already watching it and thinking to myself. Let's see how she'll mess it up again and surprise surprise... They have a chance to leave this vicious circle. But girl decides to help main character and messes everything up again... I went to sleep irritated and unsatisfied from this non-tasteful movie.
" Open ending
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,7,"Is the kind of movie i like to watch cause you cant loose a second or you dont understand anything.Loops movies in general are predictable, that 
one i think it doesnt.The end seem to be opened maybe Hannah is the answer in the new series of loops."
" It started off with an interesting idea.
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,6,"I really wanted to like this movie more than I did. The idea of the movie is very cool. A time machine that keeps resetting time when you die. Cool idea right? It is, but after the 4th or 5th time it started getting repetitive. I feel the roll for Renton was not cast correctly. Renton has the look of a tough guy but plays an engineer. I really like end of world movies, or close it. This one just didn't do it for me."
" Effective low budget sci-fi film
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,8,"""ARQ"" seems to have been inspired by several big budget Hollywood time loop movies in recent years, such as ""Edge of Tomorrow"", ""Retroactive"" and even ""Groundhog Day"". However, given that this particular go-around was made by Canadians, the budget is much, much lower, and 99% of the movie takes place in a few particular rooms of a house. Despite the extreme budget limitations, the movie still manages to work, thanks to an intelligent and clever script. I admit that the first part of the movie is quite confusing (and it almost got me to turn off the movie), but eventually any questions that we have do get answered... for the most part. Like most time loop movies, there are some details that are vague or head-scratching. But all the same, you get the general idea of what's going on, and who wants what. And the movie is directed in a compelling manner that keeps you interested even when certain details repeat themselves. The movie manages to breath new life into the time loop genre, and is one of the best Netflix exclusive movies made to date."
" Hooks brain and emotions
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,8,"I'm all into movies where some part of reality gets altered or tweaked and while it's been some time since I've seen ARQ I had to come back and review it because this is one of few in that line that doesn't just mess with the head, but also has the tension and, well, story arc like that of any good movie. It's well worth the watch."
" Really good
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,10,"Thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie, loved the ending. 
Got me thinking and that's important to me. 
Clever movie ;)"
" Unexpectedly Awesome
",2018-05-25 00:00:00,7,"Went in expecting a very mediocre movie, it was actually great. All I'm gunna say is that the ending is freaking awesome! 
Great movie!!"
" Groundhog's Hour
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,6,"In the future, sometime after the big one, a company calls Torus runs the world and ""The Block"" is the rebel opposition. Renton (Robbie Amell) works for Torus and later we find out his girlfriend Hannah (Rachel Taylor) doesn't. Renton has created the ARQ which is a ""hyper efficient energy turbine."" It also creates a time loop that he, his girlfriend, and three unfriendly burglars are all trapped in. Yes, It is like Groundhog's Day without the humor. Renton thinks of new ways to battle the bad guys without getting killed and having to do it all over again. The film progresses, but it is difficult not to get a bit bored due to the very nature of the designed repeats. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity"
" Unexpectedly great!
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,8,"I don't want to say too much about this dystopian/home-invasion thriller, so as not to spoil the many twists and turns. I found it to be a rare combination of thrill-ride and true Science-Fiction. The idea of repeating your day like a saved game has been done a few times before (most notably ""Edge of Tomorrow"" and of course ""Groundhog Day"") but this one adds the clever wrinkle of slowly doling out new pieces of a mystery along the way. The acting and script were both excellent, and the directing, sets and cinematography never once reveal any low-budget shortcuts (I'm sure that . The ending was extremely satisfying as well. I'm going to have to watch this one again to get all the subtleties of the script and performances, and just for the sheer fun of it. Highly recommended for Science-fiction fans, and probably a great one for fans of intelligent thrillers in general."
" mostly boring
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,5,"it's basically the same plot device as ""Edge of Tomorrow"" starring tom cruise and Emily blunt, but with a substantially lower budget and, quite frankly, boring.this film spends too much time with the repetitions, introducing certain elements and subelements with varying degrees of interest. They did a decent job of setting up a greater world story without using expo-dumping.By the time it starts to get interesting the film's almost over. There's suggestions of a seemingly infinite period of time spent in the loops, and the added element suggesting the time looping isn't happening universally, but only within the building the film is taking place in. Yet despite that, the people in the loop are able to communicate via radio with outside operators that is not addressed or suggestive of some further time looping at all, so it sticks out as a major plot hole.Aside from that, the majority of the film is just flat out boring"
" Interesting. Weird. Actually quite creative
",2017-09-21 00:00:00,8,"All I'd say is watch the film. It's ... different.Only 7 real people in the entire film (reminds me a bit of ""The Thing"" in that sense) but with each scene slowly peeling layers off each of the characters, showing slightly different perspectives, and so on.Wonderful soundtrack. Especially during the last few scenes. Can't quite place the melody, sure I've heard it somewhere else.I didn't really like Rachael Taylor's performance, until quite near the end. There's a simple line ""No No No No No No No"" (so I don't think that's a spoiler), where the human side really shows through; a view of someone who has seen awful things, but then has been exposed to unimaginable horror. A million times worse, as it were. By that point in the film everything is totally messed up, but that moment of realisation is worth watching the entire film for.Oh, that and the last 2 seconds of the movie. Very clever, leaves the playground open for the mind to wander. What the hell happened next ?"
" Smart sci-fi
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,8,"Well done low budget sci-fi film with good acting and clever plot. A different take on the ""groundhog day"" concept. The ending is a little weak, but a lot of these films that rely on building a sense of mystery and raising a lot of questions have a hard time coming up with something that ties everything together and provides a satisfying solution. Still worth seeing."
" I thought its good.
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,9,Of all the the time travel movies I've watched this is by far the best and worst at the same time. Best because I like they plot the story of how Renton did something for his long lost love. But its also the worst because of lacking of the back story. All of the reviews I've read is about how the movie lacked of supporting details. Maybe they should minimized the scenes of just looping and looping through time and at least tell a good narration of how things were.
" ARQ is a Netflix original film, with a lot of depth and action.
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,9,"PROS: ARQ is one of the better suspense films I've seen in a long time. Renton (Robbie Amell) plays his role with perfection, everything he does or has done was done with a purpose. Often you'll see a main character that's smart and doesn't show it, or dumb and miraculously becomes smart, but this movies character were well developed and very strategic. Another great thing about this movie was that it was able to keep the viewer interested. In case you didn't know, the main characters keep waking up after they've been killed, this would normally leave the movie to not be able to pick up the tension as the film progresses. However, ARQ does a great job at making this thriller stay thrilling throughout the movie to the end. To add on, the ending was very well crafted, it left the watcher thinking. We weren't trying to fill in the holes or arguing with the outcome, we were left pondering the meaning of it.CONS: There was a lot good to be said about ARQ, but there is one flaw that sticks out in my opinion. That flaw was the acting. It was good but it also had a very teenage horror vibe to it that I don't normally go for. Other than that the movie was a successwww.chorror.com"
" One of the best movies I've seen
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,9,"I saw this movie a year ago so maybe I've forgotten the bad parts. The budget is very low but not much is needed for the story and I think the low budget adds to the movie. The acting was believable. The story is excellent. It is a time travel movie and so many of them are full of plot holes but this one creates a universe, with a set of rules and it sticks with it. It doesn't have any silly scenes to ruin your suspension of disbelief and while the scenes repeat they don't repeat enough to be boring. The characters might not do what you expect them to do or what you would want them to do but thinking back it is what many people might do, so while that might not be satisfying it is believable."
" Really good low budget movie
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,8,"There are several floors in this movie but overall a great idea on a cheap budget. Please stop reading now if you are yet to watch it as said issues contain some spoilers!!! Now the reason why we appear to start at the first loop (nobody knows it's even happened bar our lead male) yet by the end they had recorded a video Pre-dating said loop and discover they are on their 1000+ loop not 9th or 10th as we see in the movie might just be missing an obvious point. I accept I'm no genius so maybe I missed something. My major problems occur once Sonny our 'baddie' starts to remember the loops. Ignoring the reasoning (never given) as to why various characters remember they are in a loop at various stages, my problem is with speed!!! OK so the first problem loop. In the time it takes our heroes to wake up and navigate the house, our bad guy has led two ppl to a room. Shot them, taken a body from a suit, hidden it in a cupboard and gone back and disguised himself in the same suit. In less than a minute?? The baddie then in the final loop somehow finds a way of reversing time in the loop and saving the guy who dies causing the loop in the first place!! Confused but a good idea, just needed a few more bucks and thought throwing at it!!!"
" Solid movie except for a major plot hole...
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,5,"This is my first review after being on this site since it was created, so bare with me!The movie starts off alright with quick references and the usual back and forth between characters in a loop movie. I was surprised with the pace and changes we are presented with and it's done quite well, especially for basically a debut film for the director. The acting is solid enough and I like the subtlety of the external story (raging war between two factions left for control of the world etc), there could have been so much subplot information which could have easily just made the movie a mess. Unfortunately as the movie proceeds you do start to question the choices made by the lead characters but it's not the major plot hole.The thing I could not get past is that the loop only exists within a certain radius of the machine, so therefore everything outside of the loop continues as normal. Would this not mean that the war has been raging for an unknown amount of time and Sonny would have called in for extraction of the ARK probably thousands of times? Wouldn't the dudes at Torus be like ""Yo dudes, Sonny keeps calling in for extraction like every 3 hours, shouldn't we send the Droideker and see what's up?""Overall, I didn't mind this film and it's certainly not the worst film you'll ever watch, but too many questions are left unanswered and the major plot hole is annoying. Cheers."
" Unique time-loop film
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,7,"Live, die, repeat. Sound familiar. But instead of aliens, what if it's accidental science, a crime, freedom fighters, a menacing corporation?Includes love triangle, betrayal in multiple forms, and a wonderfully slow reveal of the clues to what's going on.It keeps your attention, wondering how the protagonist will move forward through an endless repeating time loop. With some fairly good writing and great performances, it is an entertaining flick.The not-so-good. Due to the challenge of being consistent when dealing with time travel/loop movies, plot holes open easily and are resolved with sudden shifts in character's behavior/motivations/actions. There is inadequate explanation as to what's going on outside (think 10 Cloverfield Lane) and not all characters are given any depth.Final conclusion: a worthwhile viewing"
" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,8,"First it was original TV shows, then documentaries, and now Netflix is making it's own feature films. ARQ is the companies first foray into science fiction and it hasn't gotten great reviews, due to the fact that it takes place in a time loop. I love science fiction and my favorite type of sci-fi is anything that features the manipulation of time, time travel, alternate history, time displacement, and yes, even time loops. In an apocalyptic futuristic world, Renton (Robbie Amell) has created a new form of energy, one that can possibly turn the tide and save the world. Renton wants to give this gift to all of humanity, but his former employer has other ideas and decides to steal the technology in a violent home invasion, where Renton is killed. After being killed, Renton reawakens starting his day all over again, with a complete memory of what happened. He soon discovers, the longer he lives, the more he learns, but will it be enough to figure out how to escape his current predicament, as well as the unusual time loop he seems to be caught in? Science Fiction fans love this type of film, because it gives us a chance to figure out things at the same time as the main character. It also gives us the chance to think about what we'd do in that situation and see if the character agrees or has some other wildly innovative idea that we didn't even think of. These films also tend to have a lot of noir type twists and turns and can be really thought provoking. The flip side of that, is that you can see some of the same scenes as many as ten times, and if you've never seen anything like this before and aren't a fan of the genre, it can be extremely confusing. That being said, I thought ARQ was exceptionally well written and done to near perfection, some of the twists just blew my mind. On a side note, as a fan of the film Saint Ralph, I was shocked to see Adam Butcher all grown up, playing a hired gun, I really got a kick out of that. ARQ isn't for general audiences, it is genre specific for fans of science fiction. If sci-fi isn't you thing, obviously you're not going to get it and you're not going to like it. If you are a fan, this was really well done, in particular the writing was fantastic, this film will keep guessing right up until the very end, which in and of itself was shocking."
" Excellent, gripping, and underrated.
",2017-06-15 00:00:00,8,"This is an excellent movie. I'm a huge fan of time travel/time loop movies, and this one does not disappoint. In fact, it is one of my favorites. It is wonderfully acted, and keeps you guessing, and hooked till the end. Do not judge this book by its cover. I promise it will surprise you if you let it. My only regret is not having come across this sooner, and for the life of me I cannot understand why this movie didn't have more press announcement, or anything of that caliber. I had never even heard of it until I came across it on the IMDb suggestions. Seriously, if you are a fan of time travel/loop movies, or even just sci-fi in general, definitely give ARQ a go. You're welcome, in advance."
" Engaging plot, powerful acting, dissatisfying end.
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,5,"This is a really difficult movie to evaluate, because the first 99% is really well done but it all builds up to the biggest ever let down in the final 1%, and that's the part you can't talk about without spoiling it.The setting was interesting, the plot was engaging, it was fast paced and kept me on edge, the scripting and the acting were both decent to strong. Hard to find much wrong with the majority if the movie other than a couple of very minor plot holes, which does tend to happen with over the top time travel plots.Sadly, just as the tension and expectations are really building up and you're dying for the resolution... it ends rather abruptly and wholly unsatisfyingly. Such a shame!Funnily enough, I also watched Paradox recently, and it's pretty much the exact opposite: shoddy acting and scripting, with a highly satisfying ending. If only the author of that added and ending to this movie, and the actors and scriptwriters of this had been involved in that movie, 2016 would have had two amazing time-travel stories."
" Awesome movie
",2017-05-26 00:00:00,10,"I give this movie 10 because it deserves it and to help the overall score goes up and also because I usually skip every movie below 7 but since I ran out of movies worth watching so I try this one and it blew me away. It also comes with some twists like every other great titles out there. I hope you guys who agree will do the same because this movie is great and the score should be at least 7 to attract more viewers.I am always interested in a time loop movie. I remember watching one with Drew Barrymore in it, also Edge of tomorrow with Tom Cruise, Looper, Predestination.....(I am writing those titles with the help of Wikipedia about time loop movies to help me remember the titles, and pick the ones I remember I have watched. Damn turns out there are a lot more, I am going to pick more to watch after this :D) I also like the movie because when I thought about the plot and a what if question came to mind then BAM, it happened a few minutes later. So satisfying. :D I really want to write down what it is but it would be a spoiler. So I'll just keep it to myself.Go watch it and experience it for yourself."
" Something went wrong somewhere in the loop...
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,4,"I had been recommended to watch ""Arq"", so I took the advice to heart and sat down to watch it without actually really knowing what it was about, except for the aspect of the time repeating itself in the likes of ""Groundhog Day"" or ""Edge of Tomorrow"". And since that concept does have some appeal, I did of course sit down to watch ""Arq"".Color me unimpressed...What started out as a rather interesting movie, and a movie that had me constantly asking what was going on and guessing at the events, quickly turned out to be a mind numbing repetitive movie that became predictable and laughable to the point where I almost gave up. However, I decided to stick with it to the end, and did so because I was hoping that there would be more to the movie that what I was witnessing. But it turned out that there wasn't, and that ""Arq"" was in fact a less than mediocre movie.The story starts out good and interesting, and it is fairly fast paced, which is a good thing. But it takes a horrible turn for the worse and the story becomes boring given the repetitiveness of it. Plus it wasn't really all that captivating once you figure out the plot like halfway through the movie.It should be said, though, that ""Arq"" has some very impressive special effects, and it was really a treat to look at what the special effects team came up with on the screen. However, impressive visuals can only do so much for a storyline that is rolling fast down a steep hill.Furthermore, it should also be said that the acting talents cast for the roles in the movie were doing good jobs with the severe limitations of the script and the director's choices. So they were fighting and losing an uphill battle.""Arq"" was certainly a nice enough attempt, but it just failed to be unique and outstanding. And quite honestly, it was becoming a test of wills to actually remains seated and not get up to turn it off with the monotonous roll of the repetitive scenes."
" Actually, it's kind of brilliant!
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,7,"I really like it. turned out to be a really good movie.Sometime in the future a guy built a machine that malfunctions and puts him in a time loop he can't escape from.It's kind of like a less funny Groundhogs day, but very intense.I really like the energy that the movie is giving off. Everything happens at a quick pace as Renton figures out more and more about his problem and attempts to deal with it, and every time he goes through the loop he learns more about his situation, and it's always this awesome twist to his story every time he began a new loop.I won't lie, Robbie Amell seem too attractive to be a scientist capable of creating a machine that can create clean unlimited energy, but that was a stereotype I quickly got over, not that he was good at sounding smart, more like the movie was moving too fast to care that much. He did do a good job of having that personality of a too smart for you jerk.It's an excellent hard science thriller."
" Pretty tight for a ...
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,6,"Time loop movie. Does it make sense overall or rather are there holes? There probably are some, but upon first viewing I couldn't find big ones that would take the fun out of watching the movie. So if you are into Science Fiction and movies with a tight idea, than this is one to watch and enjoy.Twists and turns are coming accordingly of course and some are very neat and sweet indeed. The acting is OK for a genre movie and the characters are ""acting"" appropriately. There is action, there is tension and everything is playing at one location. So while it may seem easy (logistically speaking, also wardrobe), it isn't easy to keep the tension high for the viewer and making it fresh every time around. The movie achieves that on a tight budget"
" Keeps the tension until the end
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,8,"There seems to be new ""Groundhog day"" genre born for some time now. And the ARQ (strange title anyway, somewhat predestined to be forgotten) is another ""iterative"" story on the screen. But the realization is very good. Considering only half-dozen of characters, the story stays interesting until the end. This movie has some strange magic, which keeps you interested. Frankly, I was much more amused than last whole year in the movie theater. I recommend this movie, it is much better than it seems at first. And yes, if it would be more wildly edited (and one or two plot holes removed or explained), it would be a cult movie for sure."
" Worth a watch.

It has a good story combined with decent acting which kept me entertained all the way through.Some parts are a little predictable but if you are the type of person who can switch your brain off and not over think every detail then I would recommend this for you. A lot of the reviews for this movie are a little unfair and people seem to be expecting far to much from movies these days so don't let the negative reviews make you miss the chance to see this film give it a watch and form your own opinion.
