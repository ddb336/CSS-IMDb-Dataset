" Great but first film is better
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,7,Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed this but I felt that it was a bit unnecessary as the first film was a perfect ending to the inbetweeners but I do appreciate this film a lot
" Funny and easy watch
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,8,"Firstly, I loved the inbetweeners series and was genuinely worried the films would ruin it. The first fiilm was funny, but then the second film rang the alarm bells. There's is 4/5 genuine laugh out loud moments in this film, and not many films have that any more. The plot is not the best, but it was never going to be. A brilliant send off."
" Still more to come
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,7,I enjoyed the movie but it's neither here or there and doesn't really end anything but just opens more questions. The series ended well and could have been left at the first movie but now they have done the second and carried it on I think there is room for a third movie.
" Does not translate well to film
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,4,"The reason I am choosing to review ""The Inbetweeners 2"" over the first film is because I believe that they share the same problems yet the sequel is much worse in almost every way.To make it completely clear I do not hate this film, I don't know if I would even say that I dislike it, it is just terrible. Sure, it will entertain you and it certainly won't bore you yet it is nothing special. It is of a completely separate - lower - quality to the television series which is so beloved for it's timeless comedy. So, lets get into the reasons why I regard this film as pretty awful.The camera work is incredibly static, constant shot reverse shot lacking originality does not make for good filmmaking. They can get away with this on television but on the bigger screen it just looks amateur and vapid. This links with the fact that everyone behind this film was clearly out of their depth in terms of the production process. Honestly, they should just stick to short episode formatting as that's what their best at. If you're going to attempt making a film don't rely on staff who are not experienced in that region as it will only end with shoddy craftmanship.The Inbetweeners 2 is not funny. Over 80% of the humour is gross-out which becomes so tiring. They are lacking the relatability of the school environment which provided a lot of laughs for me. In return, I only laughed once throughout the entire showcase if that's of any interest.Alright, so let's talk about some of the characters. My favourite character in the television series has always been Neil but sadly he is probably my least favourite in this film. He is appalling, I'm not sure if its the actor's performance, the script or the direction but his comedic timing is terrible and it really threw me out whenever he was attempting humour. I don't like Simon and I never have, I don't think he fits in with the others and he just seems awkward all of the time which is not fun to watch. Will is the only likable character in my eyes and this is because Simon Bird looks by far the most confident on a film set. I have not got much to say about Jay's character, he was slightly better here than he was in the first film.It's worth a watch if you are an Inbetweeners fan but do not expect a good film because you will leave emptyhanded apart from all of that wasted time."
" Disappointing
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,6,"I love the show and the first movie, so I found this kind of disappointing. It is not bad, it just didn't quite live up to my expectations. It was like they didn't really know where to go with the story. I actually hope they make a third movie now to give the overall story a better ending. If this really is the last time we see the characters, then I find that very unsatisfying. It does have some really funny moments, but, I thought the first film was much better overall. If you like the show then it is definitely worth watching, just don't expect a nice resolution to the story."
" Surprised
",2020-09-11 00:00:00,8,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this
Didn't expect it to as good by the trailers
They seemed ok
But it turned out good"
" Not for the big screen.
",2020-07-11 00:00:00,4,"I'm glad I didn't go to the cinema to see this one as it was really just trying too hard and not successfully.
As the second film it seems to lack what the first one had and although it desperately attempts to replicate what the other and the series beforehand provided, it just doesn't quite have it. Similarly to the American Pie series it resorts to gross humour and repetition of the same joke throughout.
It's a shame really, because the chemistry and ""Banter"" between the four leads is obviously there, but the script just didn't support them on this occasion.
It's still good for a few laughs and Blake Harrison as Neil stands out as the best of the bunch in this one, with Joe Thomas' Simon seeming to take a bit of a back seat to Simon Bird's character Will.Maybe one day they will come back with a reunion or something and a fantastic script. Something where all of Jays bragging turns out to be true or some such thing? Hopefully without Greg Davies who just gives me the heebee geebies!"
" Still hilarious
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,8,"The movie ebbs and flows a little bit and it's not a full-on laughing marathon. I'd give it a 7/10 but there was enough really hilarious and memorable moments to make this a must-watch for fans of the series.
We had to replay Jay's ""punch"" (and his uncle's reaction) 3 times and the water park scene just keeps on giving.Not sure what the disappointed viewers expected but it's pretty much exactly what I thought this would be like. They can't recapture the awkward highschool moments because, well, they're no longer in highschool. But in terms of the usual head-on (misguided) hijicks, it's all still there.
Wouldn't mind seeing a 3rd movie with the characters in their 40s or something. If they can still come up with enough funny jokes to make it worth watching.Also I love that they brought pretty much all auxiliary characters back, like all the guys' parents. A lot of sequels can't manage that but in this case it further helps with the feeling of story continuation."
" Still good!
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,7,"Wasn't as good as the first one and the series but its still good. I don't think ill ever get bored of the inbetweeners. I think with this one I didn't think the hippy actress was the right person, she grated on me a little but apart from that, it's still bloody brilliant."
" dissapointing
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,4,"I think this film couldve had so much more potential. heres a few ways that i personally think wouldve made it funnier and a better plot:jays email at the start. i think it wouldve been funnier if jay was telling the truth actually. we know jay lies to make himself seem cool, but what if he actually had a mansion and was a famous dj? if the plot revolved around them living in jays mansion, but jay not being content because he missed jane, it wouldve made so much more sense imo.lucy. why did she suddenly turn crazy? it made no sense and actually didnt add anything to the main plot.will and this new girl. it was kind of lazy how they just introduced the blond girl as wills old school mate. i don't know i think it couldve been better, that whole story line. and what happened to the other girl??? did they even explain it or did i miss it?overall, this film was still funny, but the entire plot made it difficult for me to enjoy it. just watch the first film then leave it at that"
" A-wob-a-bob-bob
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,7,"There wasn't really any need to make this movie, especially after the highly satisfactory original. However, while it's not as good as it's predecessor, this is still an entertaining watch that certainly justifies its existence. The film's main drawback is the introduction of some fairly abhorrent new characters who are neither funny nor likeable. The awful Carly is replaced with the even more repellent Katie and all the scenes involving her are painful to endure. Jay's uncle is equally dreadful but thankfully his involvement is minimal. Despite this, there are some hilarious scenes and the dynamic between the main characters is as good as ever. The water slide scene is one of my all-time favourite Inbetweeners moments and the 'a-wob-a-bob-bob' line made me laugh harder than I have ever laughed in my life. Well worth it purely for these two great moments."
" Not great
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,6,The first movie wasn't anything special but it's better than this.I laughed twice during this film and the rest of the time I found myself checking my phone for lengthy periods of time.It just... ends. As if the writers forgot to end it properly.
" Don't listen to negative reviews if you're a true fan you'll still love this!
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,8,All the miserable reviewers giving this anything under a 7/10 clearly do not understand the humour and point of this great sequel
" Funny but not as good as the first one
",2019-11-25 00:00:00,6,This movie has it's funny moments but not as good as the first one. Good movie through. The one liners are funny and Will & Neil are my favourite characters. Neil's facial expressions are funny and it's that blank look he gives so funny and when Will tries to act cool and it doesn't work lol I think the series is funnier and I prefer the series.
" Doing disgusting stuff is not comedy
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,2,"Waste of time,
Full of disgusting not funny scenes,
The first movie was better somehow but still bad movie in my opinion.
Maybe It was directed to the fans of the show."
" Funny Yet Unnecessary
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,4,"The main problem with this movie is that it feels pointless and unnecessary. The original film wrapped up each character's story nicely, and this film doesn't break much new ground. It feels like the characters are back where they started after a very unsatisfying ending.The movie follows a very similar plot to its predecessor, with the four leads going on another holiday, this time to Australia. This narrative felt lazy and unoriginal. Another poor piece of writing was the complete character change for the character of Lucy, who in the previous film was sweet and likeable. In this movie, however, she is a horrible, controlling psychopathic girlfriend who feels like an entirely different person. It is also disappointing that Will and Neil's girlfriends from the previous film are absent this time around and are never mentioned beyond one throwaway line. And as much I like Greg Davies, his appearance as Mr Gilbert felt very forced and out of place here. The entire ending involving his relationship with Will's mum felt ridiculous and unbelievable, even by Inbetweeners standards.The movie also contains some visually distracting sequences, most notably a very stylized, fantastical opening sequence. It felt very out of place and did not fit the tone created in the show or previous film. And while a long take sequence involving Jay is impressive from a technical point of view, it didn't belong in this movie.Despite all these reservations that I have, the movie is still relatively funny, and it did make me laugh frequently. For a while, I was also quite invested in Jay's storyline, even if it did have an incredibly anticlimactic ending. However, as a fan of the show, I wanted more from this movie. I felt it did not do justice to the characters and brought them right back to where they began, undoing their fitting send-offs from the previous film."
" Not as good as the first one !!!
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,7,Still a good film to watch but the first one was better. Still really funny to watch and does have a lot of rudest in it . Just a feel good film to watch
" Makes me lose my love for popular demand
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,5,"I sort of wish that this movie was never made because it does seem to undo all the feel good factor just because the fans wanted another picture.Which is a pity considering all the movies the public wants that don't get made.This movie is far more like the series than the first. Not quite as depressing, but with the same lavatorial hijinks where nice guys always finish last.I'm not saying it isn't kind of funny in fits and starts but I don't think this adds anything to its genre of wince comedy.There's one really cool moment of profound pathos as the boys are confronted with the void and things get a bit real but it's sadly short lived."
" I WORK IN A TOILET AND LIVE IN A TENT
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,4,"Jay (James Buckley) is in Australia and sends our group a text message filled with male fantasies and lies about his situation. Our group somehow gets the funds for a surprise visit where they discover that Jay lied to them. While there, Will (Simon Bird) miraculously bumps into Katie (Emily Berrington) who saves their vacation by introducing the group to her friends and places to go.This is another crude teen sex comedy. The humor is sexual and lacks any intellect. It is for kids who think talking about sex in the crudest fashion is cool and funny. It is a film I would have loved at one time, but have long out grown.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity. Crude sex talk and gestures"
" Disappointing end to a legacy
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,6,"For me, the first film wasn't at the standard of the TV series, but I was accepting of that because films rarely are as good as the series. I was disappointed that they then decided to milk it one last time with a second film, which bares no real relevance and adds no real closure to the previous title. It isn't as if the first film ended on a cliff-hanger, it's not as if they had to close anything off. For me, this was a film made for the money they knew they could make. Okay it's funny, but it's very average and easy humour. The Inbetweeners should have remained as just the 3 series, but I understood why they'd want a grand slam finish with a movie, but the second was unnecessary. I'd watch it again, but it's not something I'd jump at watching. More of pass time than a hobby."
" Generous 5/10
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,5,"The biggest issue is just the narrative! Example, Will bumps into a girl by accident within a few hours of travelling round the world and it was s girl he went to school with?! Jays dads brother is Australian?!? Jay doesn't seem surprised to see his 3 mates from the otherside of the world?! Has the feel of a first draftDialogue is quite funny, the only positive"
" Just average
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,5,That girl who plays kathy is unbelievably irritating. Awful annoying voice and terrible actress.
" Just enough laughs
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,6,"The whole setup for this is pretty lazy, the story is a series of poorly constructed and clunky cutouts that don't really fit with the what made the series and even the first film tick, and the whole thing feels a bit like squeezing the last drops out of a desert-shriveled bladder. Nevertheless, there were still quite a few moments where I cackled my head off, and there was enough of the familiar humour there to make this enjoyable, despite being crap."
" Sequel
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,5,"This is the follow-up to The Inbetweeners Movie. Jay is in Sydney and invites his three friends - Will, Simon and Neil - to join him there. He claims to be a rich playboy DJ at a nightclub and that he lives in a mansion. When his friends arrive, they realise that he actually is a toilet attendant in the nightclub - and lives in a tent in his father's cousin's front garden.The four lads go to Byron Bay in Jay's car, then run out of petrol whilst driving to Birdsville. They go back to Sydney, then go to Vietnam, before returning home.This isn't as good as the first film."
