" Heartbreaking.
",2021-04-12 00:00:00,7,"This movie is a mix of fantasy/horror/drama and has alot of heart. I don't know if you can call it a horror movie, a family drama, or a supernatural thriller, it's kind of all of them.If your expecting to be scared, you'll be disappointed, instead you'll be moved to tears almost."
" So boring
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,3,Very boring. Films of the genre are not made as they used to be.
" I liked it
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,7,"I have been watching the movies from Mike flanagan before doctor sleep, this is not a regular terror movie, Jacob tremblay it's a very good actor also i have been watching him since the movie ""Room"" i give it 6.5, Mike flanagan has influences from ""Stephen King"" and i think we Will wait many interesting movies from this director in the near future ðŸ¤”"
" Pretty Good, With Flaws
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,6,"I liked this movie. I put it off for a long time before finally giving in and giving it a go. (I get tired of spooky kid horror. It's a whole genre by itself now.)Likes:. Great effects, and they don't cloak the monster! I always appreciate that. The main kid actor was great!Dislikes: The main female's acing was flatter than a pancake. I don't know if she took too much ambien herself or what the deal was, but she didn't seem grief-stricken half as much as just plain high.Also, the plot holes, if you can call them that. How is it that this kid went through SO MANY FAMILIES that didn't immediately start researching supernatural phenomenon, or turn him over to a team of scientists or something?!
I feel like if my adopted kid started manifesting any kind of bug, or my dead son, or anything else that I'd be reporting it rather than just going along with it! Holy cow! Most humans don't just accept things like this!What's more, I wanted to know more about the kid's powers. Where did he get them? Is he a character in the Marvel comic universe?
Are children with psycjic abilities common in this world? Where DID the physical people go that were absorbed by the monster?! Who was his father? Did anyone else in his lineage have abilities? Etc and so on.In the end, I'm glad I watched it. I just wish movies like this would spend less time being artsy, and more time developing the why and how to tell the audience."
" Poor
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,2,"Issues: Boy who looks about 6 drowns in a bath tub?? Female lead is sociopathic, her husband vanishes/dies but she cares not (nobody seems to care!) proving yet again that men are apparently unnecessary, million dollar home but no jobs, becomes very boring from about half way through, children's home must gloss over the paperwork."
" Lady is a horrible person
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,4,"In her happy ending she revives everyone killed by the canker man except for the foster parents of who both died, and for her husband. For some reason, the two foster parents stay in limbo, and the dad who was happy with moving on with his new family is the one stuck behind in her happy ending. I get the movie is meant to be a female empowerment movie like all netflix junk, but do they have to make them so narcissistic and unpleasant, keeping your husband dead so you can be the strong independent woman on the block is deplorable. Babadook was an infinitely better execution on the mother-son horror movie. Other than that, the movie could have gotten a 6 or so, what can you expect from a progressive propaganda platform. Will need to check who has signed and produced the movie before I watch, so I don't waste my time."
" A touching story of a child that everything he dreams of takes place. Beautiful effects, but also horror and drama, a successful blend of genres
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,6,"Mystery/fantasy film. What if someone's dreams become a reality for as long as the dream lasts? What if someone had nightmares? The central idea is quite uncommon and reminded me of the central idea of the film ""Sphere"" with Dustin Hoffman, only that it was a thriller, this becomes more mystery/drama with several elements of fantasy. A tender and dramatic story with the sweet child that his gift or curse is that everything he dreams of takes place. Beautiful effects with colorful butterflies, but also with the creepy shadow of the past that hunts him. In the end, Cancraman is revealed from his nightmare and his story is very touching. Recommended for everyone.6-6.5/10 from me."
" Disturbing
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,7,I really wasn't expecting this to be good. I would give this a 7.5 if I could. It's really creepy and the concept of the film is good.
" Creative concept but Predictable Execution.
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,5,"This had a great storyline but still felt cliched like every other horror movie story with a kid. Didnt have any thrill.
The lead actress didnt even cared of husbands death , in a world where everyone is judged for small things, I dont understand how can they stay kind with a kid who had killed loved ones of so many . I know he didnt had anything to do , but still why would someone go back to the same kid?
I found 1BR much better than this one."
" Buenisima
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,10,"Muy buena trama, buen desarrollo de la historia y un final muy bonito que cambia el sentido de la pelÃ­cula"
" Worth a watch!
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,9,I enjoyed this movie. It has some good horror elements like jump scenes but also a nice story and very beautiful special effects of the child's dream. The ending was also nice and left you feeling happy.
" Waste of a promising plot.
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,5,"Seems that they had spent so much time in the first half of the film that left no space to develop the story to a proper end.
Sad!"
" Not really a new concept...
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,7,"This movie starts off, and runs for the most part, fairly well. It's the last 8-10 minutes that (IMO) take an even more-drastic sideways turn. We have Cody, with the literal power (initially) to physically manifest his very THOUGHTS into existence while asleep (seemingly and unwittingly)...in real-time. This ability takes the rather abrupt turn in those last 8 minutes; apparently leaving an opening for a possible sequel...as in those final moments he is able to generate a butterfly while awake, a-la The Twilight Zone: The Movie's ""It's a Good Life"" segment ""hook"" . The new mom seems to hint, much like the mentor in the Twilight movie, that there's un-tapped potential in this kid, enough to make him eventually omnipotent. All in all, it was put together pretty well."
" Totally adorable...
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,8,"A mild horror with a hint of poetry, and charmingly beautiful scenes with butterflies and families around the Christmas tree, despite the gloomy context, the film is less terror, and more suspense and magic, funeral charm, the final scene (the blooming) cocoons) was of a subtlety and beauty without equal, totally adorable..."
" THIS IS TERRIBLE.
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,4,THE characters in this movie are so dumb except for the little boy. The husband dies halfway through the movie and wife doesn't care. You never find out exactly how their child died and butterflies fly around the house and it's no big deal. The social services lady just lets the wife take the kid out of orphanage after she drugged the kid and it's no big deal. Don't watch this it's boring and unrealistic
" Suuuuuch a good story
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,8,This was a great movie. I really liked the story and that's what was best about this movie. It's not classic horror movie about demons but it's special. It had a few jump scares but it was creepy the whole way. I really recommend this movie
" A Fresh supernatural drama family movie
",2020-11-26 00:00:00,7,"Great concept, good acting, and more like a supernatural movie with a small horror taste and still interesting though. Not really terrifying and good enough for a family movie."
" Breaks the mold but it's just OK.
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,6,"Mike Flanagan is a wonderful storyteller. That's what I like most about his work. And I do have to give credit where it's due, this is a beautiful story. It's also one of those films that breaks the mold and defies categorization. You can't label this one just horror, or drama, or fantasy. It's many things all at once and it crosses genres in a way we've never seen before.That being said, it left me feeling unsure about whether or not I really enjoyed it. I can't quite put my finger on why. It has a lot of good qualities but there's nothing that leaves me wanting more. Was it bad? No. Do I ever want to watch it again? Probably not. So I can only give this one six stars."
" I scored this a 10. Let me tell you why:
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,10,"Original, Beautiful Film- Not What You ExpectRarely does a film surprise me at all but this film certainly did. Mike Flannigan created an enigmatic speculative on childhood love, loss, fear and death that is both uniquely interpretive and otherworldly fantastical. For those who go into this film anticipating a run-of-the-mill horror film with gruesome effects and bloody deaths, you will be exceedingly disappointed. This film is provocative in that it makes you think and feel throughout. It is at times vastly uncomfortable, but magnificently redemptive. What it achieves is a rare feat- one I would classify more in the realm of Pan's Labyrinth than something like The Ring. What it suffers from is completely misdirected and misleading marketing which has done this gem a huge disservice.I'd watch it again. I'd recommend it to friends. Refrain from judging it based on the posters or the trailer. It's far greater than it's packaging and will probably be better received by audiences who expect more substance."
" Such a sad tale...
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,8,"This is not your typical horror movie. Although there are some visual scares and plenty of jumps, this is overall a story of loss and grief, especially from the perspective of young children. It's not perfect, but this is a good, solid film, that made me so sad at times once the storyline unravelled."
" Imagine
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,6,"Before I wake is listed under horror which is quite far away from its actual subject: Grief. So in my POV it's more a Drama with some mystery elements. What i liked was the story: the imagination of a little child becomes reality and more importantly his pain gets a name and manifests into something (on the 1st sight) evil. Are the CGI perfekt ? No, but that's fine - remember, it's a child's mind trying to cope with his mother illness and death. So, it's a fresh breath to a worn out genre worth being watched."
" Flanagan is Flanagan
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,7,"With ""Before I Wake"" Flanagan confirms himself as one of the leading horror directors. The movie is sometimes really beatiful, sometimes a bit verbose (script isn't perfect), but the skillful hands of Flanagan and the dark and suggestive photography from Michael Fimognari keep it always on a decent level."
" Wake in fright.
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,7,"This fantasy horror flick is clearly inspired by the work of Guillermo Del Toro, positing a world in which monsters usually aren't what they seem to be. The plot of 'Before I Wake (2016)' revolves around a foster couple who welcome a young boy into their home, only to be amazed by his dreams and haunted by his nightmares. The piece is one of both genuine beauty and genuine terror. It's a hopeful film, despite its moments of heaviness. It's also about more than it initially seems to be, with most elements having an allegorical counterpart rooted directly in character. This character focus is refreshing and it makes for an engaging experience. The ending is a little protracted, featuring an extended explanation of the film's events, but it's also rather satisfying. It leaves you with a smile, proving that not all horror has to be nihilistic. The movie isn't afraid to use CGI, but its restraint in other areas makes it feel generally rather palpable. It has some great creature design and well-achieved scares, too. In the end, this is an enjoyable experience. Director Mike Flanagan continues to impress. 7/10"
" Wow
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,4,"Ive always hated mediocrity.
Its always the been the worst thing to me.
But with the quality of most arts rapidly declining in the modern world, Ive even managed to adjust to THAT..But then there are films like this....So going thru the motions ....
What does he do for a living? Who cares?
Who is she? Doesn't matter. She floats around the house.
Why doesn't sunlight penetrate through school windows on summer days? It doesn't matter,
Its a horror movie. They make it look dark - deal with it and be scared of stuffNothing matters....only the things you NEED to know matter. There is ZERO characterisations. No chemistry.
Just ...these people lost their kid. These people get this kid who does blah blah.
And then the real reason Im writing thisBOSWORTH ....wowI had to check her age. Because shes doing that hollywood , hurtling towards the age of 60 thing where shes frightened to pull too many facial expressions incase it CRACKS or something. I mean. Even plastic KIDMAN still acts in her movies to some degree. But botox-bosworth is only 35 here...why???She virtually could be replaced by a cardboard cut out version of herself. So plastic and dead...just like the rest of the movie....but its fine coz whats his name is all cool and rockstar-like with his long hair and leaning against walls n stuff HahaNot a BAD concept under all blandness somewhere actually. Which is why i gave it SOME points. But boy is it drownedAWFUL"
" Give it a chance.
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,5,"I really enjoy Mr Flanagan's work, I was really surprised he had directed this. I was surprised a native English speaker had directed this.I think the acting wasn't that bad. The problem with this movie is everything. Light, makeup, hairdressing, photography, dialogue, everything makes the cast look like CGI. Yet, the CGI stands awful.The real horror in this movie is the lack of sensibility and depth involved in the treatment of the difficult subjects it tries to handle.The movie has to suffer the unfair comparison to the genuinely creepy work of art that is Babadook, addressing similar matters but with more soul than you probably would have wished the movie to have.Yet... Give it a chance. Watch it. There is a hand, turning the knob, on the other side of the door."
" Recommended for viewing
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,6,"The film was shot and edited well. Adult actors play at their best. The plot does not shine with originality, but it is quite interesting to watch. Recommended for viewing by all fans of the genre."
" Beautiful.
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,8,"The essence of the movie is beautiful. An aesthetically pleasing movie. The element of mystery works perfectly with the ""dreaminess"" of the movie."
" Enjoyed this one
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,7,It was imaginative and Creepy plus has a happy ending...sort of.
" Good enough to watch once.
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,6,"Just finished watching this one and overall I can say it's worth a watch. I wouldn't watch it a second time though, for that it's a bit too slow for my taste. The characters move a lot in slow motion, whisper a lot, the music is kinda boring, and I don't think that was really a good idea. A faster pace could have made this movie better. The good things about Before I Wake were the scenes with Canker Man, those were creepy and even if they were mostly jump scares they worked nonetheless to create a certain dark atmosphere. The acting wasn't bad, even though I wasn't a fan of any of the characters because they acted too slow like mentioned before. All in all the story is entertaining, maybe far fetched and it didn't make sense all the time and but it's still worth watching."
" DOWNHILL...
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,3,Good start but gets dreadfully worse. The plot is too predictable and the acting will make you roll your eyes
" Good premise buried by stupid writing
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,5,"This film looks good on paper but the writing is so dumb it's hard to overlook.Where exactly did the dreams take these people? Are they dead? Can they come back?...yeah apparently a HUGE part of the film gets the don't worry about it treatment.The wife apparently doesn't care one bit that a kids dream just devoured her husband and one of his classmates. She just goes on like she was never married. No investigation nothing. Ok???What in the world are we seeing in the end? All of the ""dead"" people are seen ""alive"" in some weird story sequence except for the fact they aren't. In the hall she says ""let them go"". Um what?? WHERE ARE THEY? How the F are they even dead in the first place? Why is it some feel good ending when there's literally several effing people missing and we don't get ONE SHRED of explanation as to what happened to them? CanCER man eats them and boom they're gone LOL. HOW IS THAT A HAPPY ENDING? Also we're to assume THIS KID WILL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER NIGHTMARE AGAIN?This film is so terribly written and they know it because the feel good ending tries to completely make the viewer forget about all of these GAPING plot holes. This is not a good film at all."
" Stop Classifying Everything As ""Horror""
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,7,"Before I Wake, in my eyes, is a supernatural drama all the way.This story deals a lot with grief, coping mechanisms, lots of sleep deprivation, and copious amounts of coffee.The first half of Before I Wake was very tense and it had a great eerie atmosphere which I appreciated. Then we had some real action with the Cancerman and at first I found the design to be almost laughable but I tried to keep in mind that it was coming out of the mind of an eight year old. So I gave it a bit of a pass. And then at the end we learn the meaning behind the Cancerman and it all made more sense and my heart ached even more than it already was.When Cody is able to show them the dream version of their son Sean for the first time my heart broke into millions of pieces.There was one scene that I especially enjoyed where Jessie is staring at a hollow eyed version of her son Sean sitting in an old style stand alone tub. And then he starts acting out his death scene and she stands her ground and she's able to turn away from him and walk out of the door. That took real strength for her to do.Before I Wake is a really great movie and I think more people should give it a chance. If you haven't seen this movie consider adding it to your to-watch list."
" Ridiculos
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,1,Nonsense timewaste ridiculous i dont have words its ridiculous There is no story
" Emotional
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,7,Not scary (except a couple jump scares) but the most emotional horror film I've watched
" Awesome and sweet
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,9,"This is not a perfect horror movie.. its a thriller with a nice ending.. this movie creeps into your subconscious slowly and gives a good feeling for some days..
Loved this movie and its a must watch...
Even if u dont like it.. i m sure you will not hate it"
" Canker Man all the way. Good Horror tale
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,8,"Im giving an extra star becoz of low rating.This movie need to be atleast 7 star. Overall great horror movie. Good acting , good direction , technically brilliant . Same league as Babadook ."
" Very good film not so scary ddo
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,8,"It was a good film plenty to keep you griped, wasent so scary but a phew creepy parts some parts sad aswell so its got a phew good things going for it . Please watch its worth it"
" I'm awake! I'm awake!
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,7,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this film but I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.It's a story that focuses heavily on human emotion and a young family trying to move on with their lives. You immediately feel a connection and sentimental attachement to Jessy, Mark and Cody who are all dealing with personal grief from their past.The films opening scene looks a little like the beginning of the Amityville horror but soon turns out to be more reminiscent of the classic boogeyman tale. The movie has timed it's suspenseful moments well so you always feel engaged with the storytelling. The film was both cast and directed incredibly well. I thought Mark as the father figure was the perfect choice and my pick of the film. There was never any moments in which you drift away from the main plot so it makes you feel engaged from start to finish. And by the end everything just seemed to fit into place nicely.Some of the CGI of the Canker man and the ending of the film itself was a little cheesy, but it was quite enjoyable to watch nonetheless.7/10"
" Not Bad; not bad at all
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,7,"Had almost everything I like in a scary movie with a little extra. Good story line with a really nice touch to the ending, the monster/ghost was frightening. There were a wee too many ""gotcha!"" moments in it and I liked the protagonist and the lead characters. Only thing missing for me was thunder and lightening , which it didn't need, but I'm ol' school used to those type of sound effects."
" Left hanging.
",2020-02-28 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this movie for most part of it but I felt that the end of the film came 15 minutes to early. I thought the storyline was a little disjointed and the married couple who adopted the child had no real connection with each other whatsoever. As I say, I enjoyed this film but I think the film would have been more compelling to watch if the child's dead mother wasn't a stereotypical screaming banshee and her role was toned down a little. The director seemed to be over mixing the horror angle when it wasn't necessary. The end of the movie just left me hanging. The whole storyline was a bit splintered."
" The Production Team Are Just Dreaming!
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,5,"At time of writing I haven't seen any of director/writer/editor Mike Flanagan's other films. I can appreciate that he's trying to do something a little different from your typical supernatural/horror generic piece. But to put that particular hybrid together, he just asks the viewing audience to accept way too many story contrivances.(1) The Orphanage/Social Security people must have known/witnessed Cody's abilities before and after Jessie's & Mark's experiences ... and they do nothing???(2) Whelan Young seems to have been committed to an asylum for the disappearance of his wife, even though he appears very sane. Jessie's allowed to just cruise around and under no suspicion concerning the disappearance of her husband??? This is after her being castigated for drugging the kid, though the medical authorities do the same thing themselves for the same reason.3 The cops seem to do a lot of showing up with flashing car lights in this film, but not much else, especially investigating a bunch of missing people, all in Cody's proximity.4 In the second half of the film, Jessie just seems to forget about Mark, who she knows to have been murdered by Cody's dream monster. Her priority just seems to be getting Cody back under the same roof as she. Quite bizarre and really doesn't make any sense when considering how she seemed to be happy to blame Mark for Sean's drowning in the bathtub, though we're never told why.5 Which brings me to to exactly that. How does a 6 year old boy drown in the bath tub? He wasn't a baby. Surely this needed more explanation, than just taking the lazy way out and saying, ""It just happened"".Before I Wake is a fine looking film with a good soundtrack, decent special effects and a solid cast. It's just a pity that like so many of these horror genre pieces, more attention isn't given to ironing out the many flaws and loose ends apparent in the narrative. I'm just staggered how so often the creative forces behind these productions, just expect us to accept the results of lazy writing and do so without objection."
" A great combination of horror and fantasy.
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,8,"First of all, while the premise and the start may suggest otherwise, ""Before I Wake"" is not a horror movie in all the extent of the word as it combines fantasy elements in a creative way to adopt a drama approach.
So if you're going to watch it expecting a regular scary movie, you shouldn't go ahead.
But you have to judge a piece entirely for what it is and not for what you want or expect it to be. So let's see.While the plot it's not flawless it has a very interesting premise that is certainly more than well executed. The entertainment is granted as it develops at a good enough pace to not fell rushed or dragged, so that factor should be out of the question.
Additionally, the technical view of the film is very well done. Good-looking and believable special effects and a very good acting. The dream monster, buddy Mr. Canker, is well-made and while it isn't scary for a horror flick, it's disturbing enough for this kind.
At the end, the movie leads to an emotive ending that isn't predictable and doesn't feel cheap or corny, since it's all about a well-made resolution.So, this wasn't what I was expected before watching it, but it was a pleasant surprise.
Would I recommend it? Well, if you'll get into it expecting some scares I wouldn't. But generally speaking and judging by my rating of course I would. This is really well done."
" Interesting plot bad film
",2020-02-06 00:00:00,3,Whose kid is it? Who cares. This movie has an interesting plot but does not execute it very well at all.
" An incredible movie that came out of nowhere!
",2020-01-07 00:00:00,9,"I hadn't even heard of this movie when i saw it, what a great film. this film covers many genres and has enough action, frights, drama and loving moments to tick all the boxes. . incredible film with brilliant acting and in depth story - one of my favourite films"
" Amazing.
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,10,"You won't be expecting such a sentimental movie as opposed to others in its genre. Instead of death and gore, you get emotion and suspense. Incredibly deep and refreshing compared to others."
" Befor I wake!
",2019-12-01 00:00:00,10,"Fantastic film, no waiting for ages for a little spike, straight in there. Epic all the way through."
" I was a about to fall asleep
",2019-11-30 00:00:00,4,"If an horror movie makes you sleep, it means it is very bad. Despite a good idea, the movie is incredibly boring and it ends with many unanswered questions.
-Why nobody cares about the disappearing husband?
-Why do they take the child away? Because of the pills given by a doctor? They sedate him the very next day.
-Who leaves a child facility unlock?"
" Fantasy, thrill and emotional all in one
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,8,"This film was great, I'll start with that. It was not at all what I expected and that could be party to blame on how they portrayed this movie to begin with. Do not expect much gore (if any) if that's what you're into when you see a ""typical"" horror/thriller movie. Nonetheless, it was still a great movie overall.The kid was just adorable in every way and really pulled me in to his feelings. I felt bad for the kid to be honest. However, mom and dad lacked a bit in their area. By that I mean they didn't seem as emotional as you would have expected given the circumstances they were dealing with. More so Mom than Dad. But I guess that could have been on purpose seeing as her one and only son died in a horrific accident. Either way, something just seemed a bit off about her character.Now the story was something to be told. It went in so many directions, but it played out so well in my book. It was sentimental with tons of fantasy and bits of horror. That ""cancer"" dude in his nightmares was frightening to me so I'd say they did well with that. I just loved the fantasy part of this movie more than I would have thought.With that being said, I did have a few questions on some plot holes I noticed. One being why noone at the orphanage questioned this?? I can't imagine they didn't notice something off about him, yet they still kept adopting him out to families for them to figure out. Also the ending just seemed too easy of a solution to the entire thing and seemed a bit rushed. I don't know that I really cared for how it ended. But, to me, it wasn't bad enough to hinder my review of the rest of the movie.Despite the mom character and those few minor plot holes, I would definitely recommend and watch it again myself."
" Loved it
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,9,"This was an amazing movie. It was more sad and heartwarming than scary, but I would see this again. There were some scary parts, but not a lot. When the meaning of everything started to unfold, it was the saddest thing I'd ever heard. I couldn't help to feel bad for that poor boy. Turns out the canker man is just what he saw his mother as right before she died from cancer, and he couldn't read well when he was young. This was the most thought out movie I've ever seen, definitely one of my favorites."
" Mike Flanagan!!
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,7,"Good movie. Worth watching. Very clever. Flanagan is awesome with everything he writes, directs and produces. Creative movie."
" Not a horror film and several plotholes, but it doesn't matter!
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,7,"This movie can't be named a horror film, cause it simply isn't very scary apart from maybe 2 or 3 jumpscares. Cody's childlike dreams and nightmares that become real simply look too childlike to be scary (at least for a die hard horror fan like me). But the reason they look childlike, because they are manifestations of a little boy's mind, justifies that in my opinion.
Also there are some obvious plotholes and illogical actions by the main characters. Normally I'd get annoyed over that but in this case for some reason it didn't really matter to me. I think this film is mostly a fantasy story as a metaphor for loss, mourning and overcoming loss. I think if you see it that way instead of just a regular horror film you'll appreciate it a lot more. Jessie had to overcome the loss of her child and Cody never had the chance to process the loss of his mother because he was such a young child when she died, he just couldn't understand what was going on.
Anyway, for some reason it really touched me even up to the point I was crying at the end! So I guess purely for being able to touch me that well I give this one a 7, even leaning towards an 8!"
" Bad acting & bad writing.
",2019-09-21 00:00:00,2,"The plot of the film had real potential but it didn't deliver. There were so many un-answered questions that the ending was just annoying. Kate Bosworth seemed so unfazed that her husband had disappeared, like literally not bothered in the slightest. The lack of facial expression from her throughout the whole film was borderline ridiculous. I didn't understand why they were absolutely mortified that she had given the child a sleeping pill, which was prescribed by his doctor which lead to him being taken away yet they were quite happy to physically hold him down and inject him with something to make him sleep. Right, okay? Also the ending in which she just walked out of the orphanage that was unlocked (again, ridiculous) with the child was just bizarre. The social worker person was just like meh, okay sure, take the child. She basically waved them off. This film could've been a lot better with better writing and better actors. Disappointing and I'm annoyed I wasted my Saturday evening watching it."
" Not really horror-- supernatural fairytale, of sorts
",2019-09-21 00:00:00,6,The boogeyman here is fairly obvious from the start. That doesn't keep this from being ultimately enjoyable.
" One of those Good horror movies
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,6,"I'm really thrilled when I see a horror movie which does not scary me (because I am not one of those who can be frightened by a movie at all) but which has a great base of ideas. This is one of those stories which shows us perhaps less of gore and spooky scenes but tells something more.
It is a nice story about children who can make their parents lives a dream, however, their power to turn them into the nightmares is equally strong. And it is very important to go into the journey of their subconscious before it is too late instead of ignoring signs of growing problem. It was really touching and profoundly moving. I felt great sadness while watching the second half of this movie which is unusual for this genre. Bravo.
Furthermore, the effects are beautiful. All of this dreaming with eyes open world was so colourful and vivid!
Surely, overall Before I Wake is not some kind of extraordinary movie that I am going to remember all of my live, anyway, it made my weekend quite enjoyable and I recommend it for those who want to see a well-made horror movie with less of illogical scary scenes but filled with some reasoning and ideas."
" i did not expect this
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,8,"The central idea is amazing tbh, they still could've done it better tho because there are some flaws that i just can't explain. Like, that kid was way too big to drown in a bathtub; if the Canker Man was just a ""bad memory"" of his dying mother then why those people didn't came back in the end? why she seems so unbothered oh my god her husband is missing and she's not looking for him or anything like that i mean she barely said something about him. Ignoring these things, the movie was NOT bad, really. It actually made me cry. And the little kid is amazing!"
" Did not put me to sleep.
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,7,The writer of this movie was quite right. It isn't really a horror but a dark supernatural drama.In that capacity it's not half bad. It's intriguing and stylish if a bit campy and I can forgive its cliches and other shortcomings.
" Decent Horror film Mike Flanagan...
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,7,"Plot: A young couple adopt a orphan kid,whom recently loss their 8yr old child in unfortunate accident
Film begins with a back story of main characters,parents loss their only kid n decided to adopt new kid to cobe with it
First of all film is not scary as typical horror flicks,but after 20mins film accelerate as soon couples encounter mysterious events started to happens when their newly adopt kid after he sleeps..Rest of the film is about how couples discovering a past of their adopted kid,overall story line is well gripping,suspense n supernatural elements are balanced till the end
Before I wake is slow paced,well crafted decent watchable film with just 1hr 35mins of run time..."
" KID-FRIENDLY MYSTICAL HORROR FANTASY
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,8,"It was different. But more fantasy than horror. Not scary only some jump scares, kid-friendly and great CG! No sexual or gory scenes! (SPOILERS) I wished it had a better ending. The people he took, should've returned as he understands it was all just his mind coping with his mother's lost. Overall it was phycological. And mystical."
" upset
",2019-08-05 00:00:00,2,Very bad end.. really upset... I don't like movies which have no exactly end.
" Umm...
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,4,Why didn't the kid just sit up in the bathtub instead of laying down and drowning? And how did she have a memory of it? Did she stand there and watch?
" Better than the rating suggests!
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,9,"This is more of a feel good horror mystery. Never seen anything quite like it. It starts out feeling quite fantastical only to turn pretty twisted and dark. Some of the writing wasn't the best, and I was a bit bummed about the wife's lack of concern for her husband, hence 9/10 but it's definitely worth a watch! It's a strange and quite beautiful look into the mind of young children and their perception of the things around them!"
" The 7/10 rating is for the imagery and performances.
",2019-06-28 00:00:00,7,Not quite a horror film for me. I got quite bored.
" Telepathic comic book character origin story
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,8,I read a lot of comic books growing up. This one reminds me a little of legion (really good show on FX by the way.) This could be an origin story for a Marvel character. Super powerful telepath that manifests his powers through dreams and later on learns to control them while awake. Could be a Franklin Richard's type character with reality warping powers.
" Not Really a Horror
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,7,"This movie is good, with great acting and interesting storytelling. The pacing was a bit slow which I think stems from a lack of a B story.As a horror movie it lacks from enough jump scares and ""frightening"" images. Canker man is basically Slender man.However, I was pleased with the allegorical themes in this movie. It reminded me a lot of how the film Mother! is delivered to its audience.This movie was enjoyable. Would I watch again? No. Would I recommend it? Depends on how bored you are. But there are way worse movies out there than this one."
" Decent but not great compared to other horror, but not good on its own
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,4,"This can drag and get boring. It's not really that scary, but would be a ""scary movie"" I'd be fine with mature tweens watching, as its never really gory or abusive or foul. It's just generically ""spooky"" but for adults is not really that frightening. Compared to most other horror films, it is passable but there are other horror films that actually are frightening so it feels like it would be a disservice to say that its ""good compared to other horror"" - it's okay compared to other horror, it has all the production value, but otherwise it's a big old ""meh."" You won't be hurt by watching it, but you won't miss out anything special if you don't watch it."
" Kill them with Kindness
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,10,"I enjoyed watching ""Before I wake"". Entreatingly scary but my favorite part is the end. A beautiful metaphor to how kindness and believing in the good of humanity can heal the hearts and guide many to making better choices.
Great Movie"
" The Canker Man makes Before I Wake a fine horror movie.
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,5,"It makes for an intimate portrait of not only the terror felt by children after the night light has been turned off, but in the wonder and dread of the parents who are tasked with keeping those babes safe-and shaping the fancies that dance in their heads."
" I like the blue butterfly!
",2019-04-10 00:00:00,5,"Very original script, also really sad. Very good special effects and really good creeepy moments. Those are the positives.
Just a shame that the movie is so slow..and boring .I liked the father rol with Thomas Jane, the mother I didn't like at all!.
Towards the end the movie loses it all !!!! Wtf!!! What a shame!.It could have been a reeeally good movie.
I give it a 5.5 for thriller/horror genre"
" JUST OKAY - (6 stars out of 10)
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,6,"The stage curtains open ...""Before I Wake"" is a visual extravaganza - mystical, horrifying, and even magical all at the same time. Not exactly a Horror movie, not exactly a Thriller either ... and not even a Drama. It is hard to classify this movie. What it is, to me, is a Fairy Tale - what could be a terrifying fairy tale, that caters to the eyes.Some time after the Hobsons lost their own little boy to a drowning accident, they foster another special boy and take him into their home. He is quiet, unobtrusive and is afraid to fall asleep. But when he does fall asleep, wonderful things begin to happen. Physical manifestations of what he is dreaming about actually begin to appear - starting first with colorful butterflies, then their own son next to a christmas tree ... and then the darkness begins to show through. The 'Canker Man' arrives and suddenly, his ability is no longer wondrous - it is deadly.This movie starts out with a bang as the very first scene grabs your attention and keeps you glued to the screen. As the movie develops though, it loses some of its steam. I was not impressed with Kate Bosworth in this one as the foster mother. She was one of the most boring characters I think I've seen in recent memory. Pretty much devoid of any personality, she just kinda floats from one scene to the next. Her facial expression is the same in every single take.The strength of this movie is in its visuals. Fantastic - and yet, still not really strong enough to make this a recommend. Overall, I did enjoy the story and young Jacob Tremblay was impressive as the troubled dreamer. But, it was nothing really special or noteworthy. Some people are really going to love this movie, and I can understand why. I personally felt it was just okay."
" Very cute horror
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,8,"If you enjoyed The Sixth Sense then you should enjoy this little piece of movie magic. It's not a long movie and things start happening very soon after the beginning. Though not especially scary, it does feature very clever and tasteful special effects and a better than average monster which is not simply a man dressed up, and happily the monster is definitely up and about throughout and not just an end of movie climax thing. It's a simple idea similar to A Monster Calls and I Kill Giants, though this is much more horror and less grandiose than those two. Seems this is almost a sub-genre now (better than zombies!) Before I Wake has top-rated actors and is well-performed, with professional and competent film making behind the scenes. Despite the narrow cast I wouldn't call this a B production. This one definitely won't spoil your Friday night late-night viewing."
" an emorional psychological thriller ...
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,5,"There are some minor yet important flaws in the movie, such as (probably the most important one) the little boy's age and height doesn't change when the story flashes 4 years or so back into his past ... (it does it rightly though, at a key scene near the end of the movie ...) or the fact that he rides in the front passenger seat of the car despite being still too young and short in height to be allowed to do so ... (maybe there's no such a law in the state in which the story happens? dunno ...) and there are other flaws too but let's say we can ignore them happily for the sake of a good story ...overall, this movie is rather well made imo and although a little too slow, it didn't make me go to sleep despite being quite sleepy already before starting to watch it ... it didn't force me into using the forward button either ...time well spent especially when it makes one think about certain little positive and sweet moments in life that can and do create huge negative and long lasting impacts on people's lives, especially to small children ...the educational and jurisdictional establishments need to review certain items and make the required changed accordingly ..."
" Boring and trash !
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,1,"This movie was ABSOLUTELY tarsh and i regret watching it ! Not scary and not even interesting ! This one was one of the most piffling movies i've ever seen , ugh ."
" Thomas Jane is hot and about the only thing worth watching in this mess
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,5,There is so much to unpack with this one!Jacob Trembley is adorable and very advanced for his age. I hope he goes on to have a long successful career without falling prey to the usual child star horrors.Thomas Jane is really hot. I wish he acted more. Where has he been lately? He was wasted in this.Kate Bosworth is beautiful but she's so thin I think someone should do an intervention. It's just not normal to be skin and bones. Her acting in one way was kind of realistic since she is supposed to be a grieving checked out person BUT that doesn't translate very well to the big screen so she seemed like she was in a stupor the whole time. Plus there was no chemistry between her and Thomas Jane.Dash Mihok was good.A few other random thoughts...They paint the kids bedroom and then he sleeps in the room that very same night. Ok unless they used non-toxic paint that just seems kind of ignorant. Paint needs time to dry yet they have all the furniture pushed back into place a few hours later? It's very harmful to inhale paint fumes so that was just kinda dumb.Who dries dishes with a hand towel anymore?! They have a huge house that no doubt has a dishwasher yet you see them drying dishes with a towel two different times. Weird.What kid is allowed to just roam the halls of their school unattended and unaccounted for? The bully just shows up to terrorize Jacob Trembley during recess and no one knows he's missing? That's a school that is not doing their job.What doctor just writes a prescription to a child (or anyone for that matter) without seeing them first?! So unrealistic not to mention the whole malpractice thing.Showing Thomas Jane slapping the kid to get him to wake up?! Not cool.Not sure how social services could take the child when she tells them that the pill was prescribed by his doctor.I doubt you could just walk into a mental ward and request to see a patient without a few questions first and also how did she just walk into the building where the kid was being kept? Where's security?! Same with hospital-you gotta have swipe cards for practically every door yet she's just gonna waltz into the old file area and take stuff from them?!She just takes the kid at the end with no issues from the social worker who had just got done telling her a few hours previously that she needed help and she never wanted to see her again?!Social worker was in a cocoon all gross then next scene she has nothing on her and her hair is perfectly coiffed.We get no reason why the kid drowned and why the mom blames the dad. Plus dad is taken yet she seems fine with him being out of the picture?Why was everything shot so close up? Seemed unnecessary.This movie drags and some scenes just go on forever for no apparent reason.Hopefully before I wake next time - I will have a dream that this wasn't so unrealistic and unsatisfying.
" Not a horror but a supernatural drama
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,6,"Advertised as a horror, this film is more a supernatural drama. A unique film with interesting characters and a solid plot. This is until the ending. The ending is disappointing and leaves the viewer with more questions than answers."
" An interesting 'horror' movie
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,9,Normally i find these in standard horror genre and rate them with 6 or 7 if the effects weee good enough. This has it and more then that. It has the standard scary elements but the feeling in this movie is great specially when coming to a suprising ending wich makes you leave in a 'aaaww damn' moment that makes this movie compleet. A horror(/thriller) with a good backstory is what I like!
" Pretty average horror/fantasy
",2018-12-11 00:00:00,5,So the motifs hit you over the head with a hammer - 'Chrysalis' anyone see that one coming again?Also I agree with the lack of emotion from the Mum as a big issue.Guessing the ending was relatively straightforward so slightly disappointing but I did have a few jumps although quite a few horror cliches.I suppose all in all a suspenseful film with some investigation of Mum/son and childhood processing but I wouldn't say it is original. Worth watching on a drizzly afternoon when there's little else on.
" stupid
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,1,So dumb so stupid what kid does from drowning in a bathtub. Just stand up. What a loser. I'm gonna eat him when he sleeps.
" What a surprise!
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,10,"Just found this movie on Netflix today, and what a surprise! Everything I thought was going to happen did not happen, something so rare that I now see this as a gem of a movie.Both lead actors are my favorite actors, and now this child is too, where I'm going to watch him in ""Wonder"".I did not have one moment where I thought I knew better than anyone playing their character this time, since it was also a fantasy, as well.Another surprise was the fact that Kate Bosworth has a rare condition called heterochromia. Saw it for the first time as she looked clearly at Cody.Anyway, I just enjoyed this suspenseful movie, where I hope to watch it again soon.Thanks."
" Out of genre, but not a bad movie
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,9,"Everyone says this movie is out of genre and honestly it is a bit. But that does not make it a bad movie. Yeah, it is not the top scariest horror movie, but it has some horror aspects that can be quite scary in one's first watching. For me, this movie is more of a plot and character driving movie rather than a scary movie to get the chills.
The idea is completely original and I personally thinks the movie execute it pretty good. I need to give som points for the actors. Especialle Jacob Tremblay, who acts like I think a little and scared boy in that age would act. He is the perfect sweet boy to counter his dark nightmares.
I personally adore the score. It is suspenseful, when it needs to be, and it is happy-ish, when there is room for happiness."
" Uniquely terrifying psychological thriller
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,10,"Ahhh - finally a movie that encompasses real terror, fantasy, and psychology. I put this review contains spoilers because, although it does not contain blatant spoilers, any discussion of a move before you see it can spoil it. I love that the director lets us see things in the background that are not blatant - and you could miss it - and I am always looking in the background for this; although, I did not need a reminder at the end about the cocoon. The little boy is mesmerizing and you really want to love him. This movie really made me jump so - warning - don't have hot cocoa in your hand while watching. The canker man is really good - very scary. I really love how it ends - meaning the way the mother deals with the father - haha."
" Finally someone who knows the aspect of good horror!
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,8,"This is definately a new take on horror that I wish more directors and writers would absorb and see how this works. Deep seated issues (goes without saying, but done right) Fantasy! and horror mixed into a world of full emotions.Is it the child in you? or the child you desperately want? Everyone has nightmares, can you forget them, by replacing them? will the child in you come back to haunt you for real, in real life? wake him up!!This movie is a masterpiece in my opinion, and I havn't been this excited since Kit Kats decided they would release them 4 a piece in vending machines.I don't review movies often, I prefer to watch. 12,000 so far. But when I see something, that is genre changing. This movie is it.Mike Flanagan, keep doing what you doing mate. Ze From NZ

" Focus
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,10,Another beautiful movie with great lessons for families and parents. These movies are good for us not the scary ones without any lesson just an absurd thing.
" So imaginative, visually beautiful film.
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,8,"I'll admit the trailer didn't grip me, I watched it and thought I wouldn't enjoy it, big mistake, this is such an imaginative horror, which defies all the usual horror cliches, the usual proceedings are turned on their head, the child, Cody, is a really nice kid, not the usual Damianesque monster you are normally guaranteed. The parents are not sadistic or twisted, they're just trying to do their best and get by.The film is a visual treat, when it's intended to look good it's beautiful, the butterflies look stunning, so bright, and on the flipside the moths and Canker Man look menacing and dark. The scares are good, plenty of things going on, but you need to keep watching and concentrating. I wouldn't say it has much in store for those that love gore and twisted horror, it would be tame for those, but for the casual horror viewer, this is a smashing movie.The ending was the only part I felt was a little bit of a let down, such a good film deserved a better conclusion.Well worth seeing, 8/10"

" Mike Flanagan's weakest
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,3,"As someone who is a big fan of Mike Flanagan's work, I was very excited to check out this when I saw it on Netflix. Unfortunately, it was far from what I expected. Like many other people have mentioned, this is not truly a horror movie as Flanagan has continually called this a ""dark fantasy"". Which I'm perfectly okay with.Unfortunately, the movie wasn't all that great on its own either. I had to strain my eyes and turn up the brightness on my TV to actually see what was happening half the time. Also, some plot points and most of the scares were extremely predictable. The ending also feels extremely forced, almost seeming like they changed the ending after they shot everything else, leaving some scenes to make no sense and leave a lot of story for the protagonist to magically assume.However, the acting in this was very well-done, especially from Kate Bosworth and Jacob Tremblay. Thomas Jane felt a bit wooden at times, but whenever he had to be emotional, he blew it out of the park. Plus the effects were extremely good looking, any ""dream moments"" were particularly stunning.All in all, I definitely didn't find it a good movie, but if you're a fan of Mike Flanagan or you're looking for an okay dark fantasy movie, you might enjoy this more than I did."
" My theory...
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,8,"I got creepy vibes from Mark the whole way through the movie. It is my belief that Mark drowned Sean and was abusive to Jessie.I have trouble believing a child that age/size would drown so easily in a bathtub. He'd have to have fallen and hit his head, and from the flailing in the flashbacks I'd say that wasn't how it happened. Maybe he had an underlying condition like seizures, but it was never mentioned. At one point in the movie Jessie blames Mark for taking Sean away from her. He reacts as if he knows exactly what she's talking about and gets upset that she still blames him. Which makes me think Sean died on Mark's watch. It might be believable that it was an accident but Mark just seriously creeps me out, I think he drowned him.I think Mark is the one who hit her in the bedroom scene, I think that she was just so mentally worn down she blocked it all. Note how the people around her all seem to know that he's abusive and she's the only one denying it. But some part of her knows, which is why at the end when she says what could happen to the people who disappeared into Cody's dreams she let her husband die for good but the others she let live.I think they did overreact a little to her giving him a sleeping pill. But you saw how she obtained it. She's clearly a nurse or something and used her connections to get her buddy to write a prescription. That is definitely red flag raising.I would like to know why there was absolutely no security at the orphanage and how the case worker let her take Cody without even signing paperwork. I imagine the caseworker was out of a job the next morning. At the beginning she seemed to know the family and be friendly with them, then suddenly she's blunt and telling Jessie to get help for her situation.Everyone gave me the impression that they thought Mark had run out on Jessie, and maybe abducted the bully too.I figured out the reveal about the canker man before they showed us because the bag of belongings from the mother were marked as being from oncology. I did tear up though when the reveal was going on. This movie was beautiful in a sad way, and definitely worth seeing."
" Actually pretty scary, very creepy, and tear jerking!
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,9,"I definitely recommend this movie! It had a lot of great aspects such as fantasy, mystery, creepy, scary, tear jerking and a semi kind so kinda not so happy ending."
" WOW!
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,10,"Not exactly a horror movie, but it had its own freaky moments. Later, you realize that it's not as freaky as it seems, but regardless, it's so worth a watch. Movies seem so predictable these days, especially horror movies/psychological thrillers. This is a very refreshing change!!!! I highly recommend it."
" Beautiful and scary at the same time
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,9,"Nice movie with good plot. Cannot believe the critics that go on about the 'it's called a horror movie but it isnt really a horror movie'... who cares about the genre name tag? It is a captivating movie with a beautiful plot, the ending is touching and satisfying."
" Dark fantasy-horror hybrid Fable
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,7,"Having seen and liked Flanagan's other movies, I still approached this with some caution. The reviews and even the director himself were referring to this as a dark fantasy tale, but having seen it I would classify as a mix of that and horror, because there are certainly some horrific events taking place in this movie - until you realize, by the end, that it's also a fable and a dark one at that, for my money.While I didn't know in which direction this one was going, I can see some why folks might have frustrated by this - either because it's not a pure horror film, or those who may have seen the ending coming from a mile away. I would summarize this movie as a series of metaphors about how we deal with loss, memories, and the limits of imagination. At the same time, I can't help but think of this movie with fondness and awe of the beauty of these things, but also knowing one has to let go, after all - life goes on."
" Third act fails
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,3,"Title of this review sez it all, folks. Sweet, thoughtful, somewhat thrilling two thirds of a film that ends with an illogical whimper."
" Amazing Horror Movie!
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,9,"This movie has got to be one of the scariest films I've watched. With the right timing jumpscares, and everything. Although, I don't understand why the police would be mad if she gave him sleeping pills.. And how did the child drown in a BATHTUB? He could've sat up straight.But overall, the movie is amazing. And very scary.
I absolutely recommend it."
" So many questions
",2018-07-07 00:00:00,2,"Question 1: Please tell me why a child that size drowned in the bathtub?? Sit up kid. 
Question 2: Why is no one investigating her missing husband? Meanwhile she's doing ""research"" like most typical horror films trying to get to the bottom of it!
Question 3: Does she even care that her husbands gone?? Nope. Doesn't seem to bothered by it. 
Question 4: Why were they so angry with her for giving him a sleeping pill only to hold him down to give him a shot???
Question 5: Why was the front door to the orphanage unlocked???
I think that's it. But I'm still pretty confused by the whole thing. Could have been great, but didn't quite get there."
" Not totally believable, but enjoyable anyway. Refreshingly different.
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie - I liked the boy's character, and the story line is well written and I thought it was pretty original even though some apparently don't. It seems pretty cliche in some parts for this type of family drama horror for the first 3/4 of the movie, but the ending is different from any I've ever seen before and I liked it. 
I can't give too many details without spoiling it, but other than requiring a small suspension of disbelief at the boy's ability and the results of it, they really explained things very well in the end and brought it to a good conclusion. Which was a nice contrast to some of the other shows I've seen lately."
" Solid supernatural horror film that doesn't insult your intelligence.
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,8,"If this movie was in a genre other than horror/fantasy I would probably only rate it a 6 or 7. However, compared to others of this genre I'd give it a 9. Although the acting is rather mundane and some of the dialogue implausible, the premise is fascinating, the story is coherently told, the action is well-paced and it is appropriately eery, creepy and scary. Perhaps most importantly for this genre, the movie actually makes a reasonable attempt at a conclusion to explain itself, something most horror movies either don't even try or when they do they fail miserably. If Netflix is prompting you to watch this like it was me, I recommend you watch it."
" MUCH better than expected. Really great!
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,7,"I started watching the film with the pre-conceived idea I wasn't really going to like it, or that it might be boring. I couldn't have been more wrong! This was scary. This was magical, sad, believable and beautiful! Yes, we've all seen movies before where a couple adopts a child and things then go very wrong. I actually expected this to be a 'been there seen that' scenario. The actors were really great and convincing. I also enjoyed the idea of the mother being in a therapy group, as it helped clarify a lot of things. The film has a great atmosphere and great visuals. I loved it."
" More Hollywood predictability
",2018-06-13 00:00:00,4,"BEFORE I WAKE is yet another Hollywood CGI ghost story with a predictable plot, predictable look, and no decent scares. The story is once again about a grieving couple (is there any other type in this genre?) who take in a foster kid. It turns out that he's terrified of falling asleep, and for good reason as he ends up being menaced by a CGI ghost dude who proceeds to menace the rest of the family too. It's all faintly ridiculous stuff, not helped by the generic, predictable nature of the writing and the tired performances from Thomas Jane and Kate Bosworth, who both look like they want to be elsewhere. But then, can you blame them?"
" Wow, what a great non-gore fantasy horror movie
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,8,"I read nothing about this movie, but it kept ""haunting"" me on my Netflix recommendations. It looked like a forgettable b-movie, but boy was I in for a treat when I finally decided to watch this.The story is about parents who have lost their son in an accident and who adopt an 8 year old boy whose dreams manifest as real things. You can't really figure out whether it's a movie worth watching by reading the synopsis really, you're just better off watching it. Not the most logical movie ever made and you can probably find a plot hole galore, it's even a bit slow to start with, but in the end this was one of the most beautiful and at the same time one of the scariest movies I've seen in a while.Only now coming to IMDB I found out that this movie was directed by the same guy who did Oculus and Ouija: Origin of Evil, some of the better horror movies I've seen lately. Count me as a Mike Flanagan fan. I probably need to watch Gerald's Game now too, which I had zero intention to watch, but I saw it's also directed by him.Before I Wake is a very well made movie. Well shot, acted and directed. Highly recommended. It has zero gore and blood, but is scary as hell at times and is also very touching. Some strange stylistic choices like making Thomas Jane look like Chad Kroeger of Nickelback, but once you get over that it's a great great movie."
" Definitely a must see!

" Great story, despite the bad acting
",2018-05-11 00:00:00,7,"I can't remember watching a movie with the same story. I believe that this is original. The movie is entertaining, has a good dose of horror, and a great about of drama.
The last 10 minutes are just amazing. I gave this movie 7 stars rating despite the horrible acting of Kate Bosworth. She was by far the worst thing that happened in this movie. Totally emotionless. I bet the movie would have become a real hit if they have chosen any other actress ... literally anyone else would be better.A very good movie overall, highly recommended"
" starts out well
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,4,"This movie has a lot of potential and an intriguing premise. Unfortunately, towards the end it begins to unravel, seeming to face sort of an identity crisis in that it can't decide if it wants to be a supernatural thriller or an over-the-top gloomy cancer-victim-grief-supernatural-drama thing. In the end, the sadness just zaps out the ""thriller"" part of it and it leaves you empty."
" Subtly Creepy and Well Written
",2018-04-26 00:00:00,9,"It's nice to see a horror movie in this day and age that doesn't rely on jumpscares with a loud music stinger. The acting isn't the best, but the mood and atmosphere make up for it. The creepiest moments for me are when you briefly glimpse the Canker Man in the background or in shadow. I also like that they explain the origin of the monster at the end.Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience and a breath of fresh air for a modern horror movie."
" Interesting premise and very promising start, just did not finish
",2018-04-11 00:00:00,6,"I saw this film on Netflix mainly because it was recommended by a friend at work. It was interesting and hardly a waste of time, but like so many horror movies throughout history, it had something, but it did not fully deliver. It amazes me how often this happens, perhaps it is easy to come up with a creepy concept, but it is just hard to find a satisfactory way to finish said horror film. This one starts out very well, has some good creepy stuff going on, but kind of ends in a very dissatisfying manner that it made me enjoy the film less than I should have. One thing that surprised the heck out of me is when I came to this page to review the film, Thomas Jane was the dad. I do not know how the heck I did not recognize him when I was watching it! The story has a couple who have recently lost a child about to become foster parents to a troubled, but super polite young boy. This young boy seems to want to avoid sleep at all costs as he chugs sugary drinks and takes those pills that keep you awake. The mother tries to get him to sleep, but when the boy does strange things seem to happen around the house. Seems, butterflies appear and it is not long before the parents realize that the boy's dreams manifest themselves in the real world. The mother tries to take advantage of this gift to see her deceased son, but the father is opposed to using the boy this way. However, soon, both parents find out that not only do the boy's dreams manifest themselves, but so do his nightmares! The cast is pretty good and the film is rather well done. It has a similar premise to another film, ""The Disappointment Room"" in that both films feature a couple who have recently lost a child, though this one is far superior to that one. The ending is disappointing though, as it tries to be kind of happy, but it leaves so many things unanswered. Thankfully, though, the film has pretty good pacing and enough things good about it that the ending doesn't totally detract from the rest of the film. So the film had its moments, it just could have done a bit more to finish things out. The premise needed to be explored more fully than it was instead of leaving us wandering what the heck happened to certain people. The film features some good creepy scenes and has a rather unsettling creature within. Was not a bad film by any stretch, but not very good either. That is like a lot of horror films, they have a good story going for them and things such as an ending that fails to deliver end up making it less memorable and good than it should have been."
" beautiful and chilling with a open ending
",2018-04-08 00:00:00,10,A beautiful movie that has thrill elements but also blends in so much emotion
" Wasn't expecting much but it surpassed my expectations
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,8,"I try to randomly pick something different for me from Netflix at least once a week. I'm not really a Kate Bosworth fan, but I picked this one tonight and was happily surprised. Categorize it how you want, it is a movie about a foster couple who have lost their son. They take in Cody, a sweet, polite, adorable 8-year-old. They soon discover his dreams-good or bad-come true. Yes, Kate Bosworth and Thomas Jane seem too 'perfect' (and what in all that is holy is up with Thomas Jane's hair?!) and there are a few holes in the plot but you know what? Sometimes you should just watch a movie without having to pick it completely apart. It's a psychological fantasy. Enjoy it. Plus, the kid is pretty darn cute and I hope to see more of him in the future."
" New dish with Old stuff... Good in bits and pieces but Slow
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,6,"Last night i came through it on Netflix, first i watched its trailer and i find it very interesting and gripping. So i started watching movie and soon with some good moments it become repetitive and boring. Movie had a old concept of dream and sleep like in Freddy or nightmare on elm's street but with cute angle of little kid having superpower which make it good concept. But it didn't hold much as movie gets slow with time not gripping, thrilling enough and even horrors scene weren't scary. Good parts about movie is some scenes with little kid Cody(Jacob Tremblay) acting and ending was good. So overall its average, one time watch or you can watch it for Little Kid Jacob. Last scene also leaves room for sequel which i believe Netflix should try because movie have good concept and the Kid is really talented and we all have seen his Wonder."
" Unexpected
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,10,"This is the sweetest horror movie I've ever seen. Jacob Tremblay is heart-wrenchingly adorable in this movie and the character he plays is such an empathetic, sweet little boy, to the point that I was tearing up occasionally."
" awful, just awful
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,1,"You can always tell the fake paid for reviews. this isnt one of them. this is a boring mainstream piece of crap. nothing interesting about this movie at all. theres nothing remotely likeable about the characters. the acting was pitiful. even the dads haircut made me hate him with his nickelback looking ass. cgi sucks (cgi always sucks). the scary parts were seriously laughable. lots of jump scares and loud noises. the ending was cringe worthy.what you'll experience in this movie is about the same as walking through a very cheaply constructed haunted house. its basically everything you hate about hollywood ""horror"" movies. if youre looking for something with substance, a real story, character development, and doesnt tie everything up in a nice pretty bow for you, look elsewhere, because all youll find here is a heaping pile of garbage."
" Great idea, good acting, poor execution
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,5,"I stumbled upon this movie on netflix, and thought I would give it a shot. I didn't know anything about it going in. The idea the creators had for this movie was really pretty good - unique, interesting, has depth that a lot of films these days lack. The acting was adequate, not necessarily the best I have seen from these actors, but it was ok. The worst part was the constant plot holes. It was just so hard to get into a movie when in the back of your mind you are saying, that would never happen like that, a person would never behave like that. And I'm not saying that the fantastical elements of the movie were unbelievable, I liked those parts and I love supernatural thrillers/dramas. But this movie just could have used someone in the writing procedure just look at things with a little more common sense about the way humans act. I still think it was not a waste of my time watching, and the idea was enjoyable, just if you are going to give it a go, try not thinking logically while you are watching and it may be more enjoyable."
" One of Flanagan's better movies
",2018-02-09 00:00:00,8,"Most of Mike Flanagan's movies I have wanted to like more than I have liked them. 
Therefore my expectations were quite low when I began watching this. Turns out things got turned around. I didn't really want to like this one, but I did. 
It was actually a beautiful mix between fantasy and horror, and although many elements have been seen in other movies, there is a lot that is fresh which left me smiling when the credits started rolling."
" Doesn't quite ever live up to it's great potential.
",2018-02-02 00:00:00,7,"'BEFORE I WAKE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A horror fantasy about a couple who adopt a child who's dreams, and nightmares, come alive physically when he sleeps. It stars Kate Bosworth, Jacob Tremblay, Thomas Jane, Annabeth Gish and Dash Mihok. The film was directed by Mike Flanagan (who's also helmed such other low budget horror flicks as 'OCULUS', 'HUSH', 'OUIJA: ORIGIN OF EVIL' and 'GERALD'S GAME'), and it was scripted by Flanagan and Jeff Howard (Flanagan's frequent writing partner). It's received mixed to positive reviews from critics, and it was released by Netflix through it's streaming site. I enjoyed it. After tragically losing a child, and being unable to have more kids of their own, Jessie (Bosworth) and Mark (Jane) decide to adopt. They pick an eight-year-old boy named Cody (Tremblay), who seems like a sweet and idealistic kid. Then the couple witnesses Cody's dreams manifest themselves in front of them. The dreams are at first beautiful things, like butterflies, and the couple also sees their deceased son (Antonio Evan Romero) appear among them too. Jessie sadly takes advantage of Cody, in order to create her lost son for her. Cody's dreams soon turn to nightmares though, and a horrific and deadly monster appears. I've really enjoyed Flanagan's other movies, and I really like this cast as well; especially Tremblay, who's turning into such an impressive young actor. The premise for this film is really interesting and creepy too. It's even beautiful and touching at times. The film overall is a little slow though, and it doesn't quite ever live up to it's great potential. Still, it's a decently made little horror flick, without a doubt."
" Just Wonderful
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,9,"This was a magical fantasy story, far removed from being a 'horror' movie. Great story, great acting and a wonderful ending. I may never view butterflies quite the same again. Well worth the time to watch."
" Sure, it's normal to see butterflies wafting around the house!!!
",2018-01-24 00:00:00,4,"I'm only half-way into this movie, but I already feel compelled to write a couple of comments. Even though I haven't finished watching the movie yet, I'm giving it a poor rating or 4 out of 10 stars. Why you ask? Simple. The married couple's response to seeing their living room full of blue monarch butterflies; followed by seeing their son in the flesh, IS TOTALLY RIDICULOUS!!! Unless you were born and raised in the land of OZ, where crazy-ass occurrences are the norm, you simply wouldn't respond with the emotionally-muted question of, ""GEE, WHERE ARE THEY COMING FROM??"" Then, if the appearance of the butterflies out of NOWHERE didn't catch your attention, don't you think seeing the butterflies DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR, MIGHT CATCH YOUR ATTENTION???? Not these two! They just head off to bed, like nothing ever happened. Even more RIDICULOUS YET, the following night, when they see their dead son in the flesh, THEY DON'T SAY A SINGLE WORD TO HIM!!! They hug him, and then cry when he disappears; after which, they just trot off to bed, again, like nothing ever happened. ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?!?!? The only way this response would make any sense, is if these two popped some acid; but, based on the story line, that is not the case. THIS MARRIED COUPLE SO UN-INQUISITIVE, THAT EVEN IF SANTA CLAUS SHOWED UP IN THEIR LIVING ROOM, I SUSPECT THEY WOULD JUST OFFER HIM SOME COOKIES, AND THEN GO TO BED!!! This is just horrible writing!!! No sane person is going to encounter these events, and then just skip off to bed, with absolutely no discussion about it at all. DUMB!!!"
" Unanswered questions
",2018-01-23 00:00:00,3,"Like many are saying, the idea was good, but too many questions went unanswered. If the monster was only in the boy's mind/dreams, where did the father go? and the other foster mother? And how was she just able to walk into the home/hospital where the boy was held at the ending? She sure did not seem that upset about her husband vanishing. I also wondered what they did for a living! Never shown going to work, yet with a gorgeous home?"
" Whiny Kid!!!
",2018-01-20 00:00:00,2,"The movie is okay, but would have been better had the kid not used a little baby whiny voice! Why do they all do this?!? Use a regular voice instead of tryin to sound like a 2year old! All movies do it, like it's cute....SO ANNOYING!!! As far as the movie goes, not a bad watch. Good way to waste an hour and a half on a rainy day."

" Beautiful fantasy !
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,8,"So I really like the idea of this movie it's so dreamy how dreams can come true and it is such a beautiful thing this movie shows us and when nightmares come true it can scare the hell out of you that's what the movie is about. It's a story about a family who lost their son and Foster a child which shocked them because the child has the ability to make his dream come true in physical existence so his nightmares .The twist before the ending part is doing to surprise you ! If you are looking for little goosebumps, thriller but also love fantasy this choice can't go wrong so why not give it a try.
The child is played by Jacob Tremblay as cody he has done an amazing job and the foster parents played by Kate bosworth as Jessie and Thomas Jane as mark they did well in their part tho."
" This is not a horror movie
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,9,"It's a great movie about how a child processes something horrible, unfair and cruel. This movie is unique, and it makes you think. Don't expect a cheap scare and watch till the end. Deep."
" Glad this got finally got a U.S. Release
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,7,"Awesome premise, good cast, decent score. Only problem I had were with the monster design. It would have been better left in the dark, shadows or quick cuts as the cgi wasn't the greatest. But in the the end it made sense so I couldn't fault it. Pretty witty ending."
" Every Netflix produced movie is a chick movie
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,5,"Whatever it is, whatever the genre, whatever the story, plot or theme, every single movie that Netflix churns out on their own is a chick movie. This is another chick movie. It has all the chick movie components. Dead kid, depressed beautiful rich mom with no friends, useless husband, group therapy sessions, sad piano music.It's pretty good as a Netflix-Lifetime chick movie without the drunk violent ex husband but it's not a horror movie or a ghost story or a thriller or suspenseful. It's a chick movie. It's pretty much an ode to one rich white girl's reproductive system. With a little bit of tweaking they could turn it into a Christmas movie-Chick movie combo. All we can hope for is that by the end she magically gets pregnant."
" mind boggling and incomprehensible
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,5,"Still didn't understand what the heck happened.I can guess ,this movie shows a mutant whose telepathic power can put the professor X to shame. Not even jean gray can handle him. However If that what they wanted to show then they did a very poor job ."
" dream time
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,6,"Mike Flanagan's ""Before I Wake"" is one of the more unusual horror movies that I've seen. It looks at how our experiences affect our dreams (does that make it more psychological thriller than horror?). Some of the scenes are kind of silly, but it's actually an interesting movie. Jacob Tremblay's character reminded me of his role in ""Room"".The thought of a person's dreams colliding with reality might sound like a ripoff of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", but this is an original story. I particularly liked Kate Bosworth's performance (Thomas Jane's was too underdeveloped). It's not a great movie - far from the scariest movie ever - but I enjoyed it. Also starring Annabeth Gish (Agt. Reyes on ""The X Files"")."

" Beautiful Story
",2018-01-11 00:00:00,10,"There is a review by phaylen, titled Original Beautiful Film - Not What You Expect. They nailed it with that review. I am a horror junkie, and added the movie to my list in expectation of finding a new horror movie to watch. Now, there were a lot of very haunting images, some jump scares, and lets face it, our nightmares are truly the ulimate horror; then what if they came true? But to me it is less about horror, and more about a beautiful supernatural story. I feel no need to nitpick it, to me the story was executed brilliantly and I could easily fill the holes some have complained about (though I generally don't search for holes anyway, it's a movie, the point is to tell a story, sensational or not. Just like cars that blow up in action movies. That has become a much loved clichÃ©, not a thing to nitpick. So I never did understand nitpicking movies. Every time my husband does it, I remind him it is a movie, he says you're right, and goes back to simply enjoying the story.) And comparing to Pans Labyrinth, YES! GDT is my favorite director, and horror my favorite genre. I loved that movie too. Too often expectations prevent people from seeing good in something absolutely wonderful, just not what they expected. Not me. I love surprises."
" Underwhelming
",2018-01-09 00:00:00,6,Why wasn't she bothered at all that her husband was gone?!? Why did she imagine the others returning to their loved ones and not her spouse? There are still some pretty serious psychological problems with that character.
" Whimsical
",2018-01-09 00:00:00,9,"Other than a trailer and the short description, this movie is best going in blind because it truly is not what you would expect. Mike Flanagan and Jeff Howard have a knack for creating a suspenseful thriller with a takeaway. As a movie overall, this is one of the best in terms of thought provoking in several small ways in areas I did not expect. 
Nothing was overdone nor was it too skimmed. 
Very good movie, no matter the genre."
" not your typical monster movie
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,8,"i didn't know when i decided to watch this that it was written and directed by Mike Flanagan of Ouija: Origin of Evil; if i had, i might have passed it by, so i'm glad i didn't the premise â€“ a couple welcomes into their home a foster child whose dreams and nightmares, they discover, manifest physically as he sleeps â€“ is a unique and interesting one. it's well-executed. the story is very compelling, it maintains my interest from beginning to end, and i like the characters and want them to have a happy ending the leading actors, Thomas Jane (The Punisher, The Veil), Kate Boswell and Jacob Tremblay are each excellent in their roles. the special effects and monster designs are alright, nothing particularly impressive, but they don't detract from story. and the music, which i'm surprised to learn was composed by Danny Elfman and the Newton Brothers, is just kind of -there-, not bad, but it didn't really capture my attention the film is categorised as fantasy/supernatural horror, but those elements are far less interesting to me than the psychological experiences of the leading characters. i'm not sure whether this was intentional, but i think the supernatural element works really well, and i find it very relatable, as a metaphor for ptsd this is not your typical monster movie. the horror feels like a secondary aspect, and viewers who watch it for that will likely be disappointed, but if you're in the mood for a good psychological thriller that inspires analysis and reflection, you might find this worth a watch"

" Absurd situations that can't just be ignored
",2017-10-28 00:00:00,4,"Somnia features an intriguing beginning because of an interesting plot, enjoyable locations and likable characters, then everything will start to fall apart. There are too many nonsense moments, you will disagree with almost all of the actions taken by our protagonists, and the events taking place will be far from realistic. Be aware of the genre, don't expect this movie to be much of a horror, don't expect this movie to be much of a fantasy neither ... it's a mix that I didn't personally enjoy. Special effects are well made at least. Cutting it short: the main issue is the writing and the ridiculous situations. I don't want to make any spoiler but hopefully you will understand my concerns when I mention the words ""careless people"".P.S. Jacob Tremblay, the kid, is great."
" Not Worth Seeing. Warning Spoilers
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,1,"Warning Spoilers! I was very disappointed after seeing this movie, it was mostly predictable jump scares and everything was very rushed or not explained enough. The ending really upset me most of all when Kate Bosworth goes to the orphanage to take back Cody while all his nightmares are being released. For the first time the Canker monster decided to eat any of the people there and on top of that every time Bosworth came face to face with a nightmare she easily walked away from it. Then she sees this monster thing and gave it a hug and instead of it becoming Cody's actual birth mother (which the monster is based off of) it becomes Cody, cause you know that makes sense... Anyway Bosworth takes Cody home without any trouble, literally none, the woman who runs the orphanage is just like meh okay take him. Then Cody learns all about how the canker monster became his fear and how all those people that went missing that were eaten were just gone forever, not like anyone really looked into their disappearances from the start though. But hey Bosworth gets a new son because hers drowned no questions asked (no you will never find out how he managed to drown or why she blamed her husband for his death)"
" It is the best movie ever .
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,10,"I was surprised when i didn't see this movie in the box office it is a great movie with a great lines and ideas . First i fall in love with the idea of the dreams becoming true ( who would not fall for that ) , second Jacob Tremblay was a genius in acting the role ( again who would not fall for him ) ,third the idea of butting the cancer as the horrifying ghost which we all scared of is just genius , this disease killed a lot of our be loved ones and it is a horrifying ghost eats every thing . Kate Bosworth was very good as a mom in this movie she is represent what should moms do to their children when they have problems . This movie represent a good drama , story , actors , fantasy and ideas ."
" Great potential, but cardboard characters. The ending was intriguing.
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,7,"As horror/thriller movies, this wasn't bad, but the characters' shallowness messed it up. The underlying idea was fresh and interesting: what if the dreams of a little boy would become reality? Unfortunately, they kept the dreams and nightmares to the basic things the boy saw the day before sleeping plus one recurring nightmare. Try to remember what little boys dream and imagine how much more impressive (and scarier) this could have been.To me the worst part of it all was Thomas Jane's character. A nondescript dad, whose only role in the plot is to be a fun father and a placeholder husband. He played it OK, but man! what lazy writing.The movie started somewhat slow, only to accelerate to unacceptable levels at the end. If this would have been more than an interesting idea with sub par implementation of the details, it could have been a classic movie to be remembered by the fans forever. As such, it's forgettable and uninspiring."
" Good idea, cheap netflix movie
",2017-08-31 00:00:00,4,"I liked the initial idea, a kid having dreams that represent in real life. Just imagine how far they could have gone with that, with good special effects and photography, and decent acting. Sadly, the only good thing in this movie is the ideaThe effects look cheap. There's no artistic pretensions in the photography. The pacing is terrible. Already in the first ""nice"" dream you can see a ghostly presence, they could have waited a bit more. And after that, the dialogues become long and tedious The acting and dialogues come from a Hallmark picture The director makes neverending closeup shots on actors that show nothing. The mother has the same hair and face in every single scene of the movie. The house, the couple, everything lacks of layers, they're just a couple that lost a kidBottom line, it's just another netflix movie, try to avoid it"
" Good movie, lacked some work. I recommend u watch it !!:) This contains spoilers....
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,7,"There where a couple of weird plot descicions. Like why the latest foster father which we follow thru most of the movie got ""eaten"" He was not sick or mean, so it doesn't really make sense why he would die. Also some other small errors and filming mistakes. All in all, would watch again and i do recommend it, if u want too be spooked. Great visuals, and not too gory or overly done ""scary"" faces."
" Intriguing Supernatural Story
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,6,"SPOILER: Jessie (Kate Bosworth) and her husband Mark (Thomas Jane) are grieving the loss of their son Sean (Antonio Romero), who drowned in the bathtub, and Jessie is in a group therapy. They decide to adopt the eight year-old orphan Cody (Jacob Tremblay), who was abandoned by two foster families. Cody is a lovely boy and becomes the pride and joy of Jessie and Mark. Cody avoids to sleep and Jessie and Mrk believe the boy has psychological problems due to the rejection of the previous foster parents. Soon they discover that when Cody sleeps, his beautiful dreams come true. But the problem is that the same happens with his dreadful nightmares. ""Before I Wake"" is an intriguing supernatural story of an orphan with a special ability. One great difference from other horror movies is that the boy Cody is sweet and not evil. There is explanation for what happens but the conclusion could have been more commercial and less gloomy. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Sono da Morte"" (""The Death Sleep"")"

",2017-07-27 00:00:00,8,"I went through hell to watch this movie but I don't give up easily. After spending forty-five minutes searching Google for a DVD or Blu-ray I moved on. A brain storm led me Amazon.CA (Amazon in Canada) and sure enough they had it. It seems it's available almost everywhere except the United States. Since the Region Codes are the same for the US and Canada, I ordered it and it arrived today.I popped it into my computer for a test run and it would not play with Power DVD. It kept telling me I needed to update Power DVD for it to play and of course the ""updates"" would not work and it still wouldn't play.Next I took it to a Blu-ray player and after watching at least five hideous previews it finally came on the screen with a small box that said, ""Restricted"" and would not play. So I hit the ""Menu Button"" and got it to play â€“ in English â€“ with English Subtitles. I hit the ""Menu Button"" again, switched it back to the regular version, and presto, it began to play like any normal Blu-ray would.Immediately this film brought a couple questions to mind. Who the hell thought up the scuzzy drug dealer haircut for Thomas Jane? And, how did this couple afford their lifestyle when neither of them appeared to work or have jobs? If anyone knows how one can do this I'd like to find out.Other reviewers have covered the plot. I'll just say that for me this film was worth waiting for. It engages the viewer's emotions as well and giving a large dose of suspense. Its ability to transition from grief to supernatural thriller was rather amazing. I'd recommend this to fans of suspense, thrillers, and horror genres and especially to those who love a nice dose of sentimentality mixed in."
" horrible! worst movie ever so stupdi!
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,1,"this is the stupidest film i have ever seen in my entire life it's so retarded and so utterly stupid! SO boring and so stupid it's like a 5 year old wrote it and it could have been done better if a five year old did it, seriously worst movie ever there's an hour and a half of my life gone that i'll never get back thanks a lot waste of my time!"
" One of scariest movie
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,8,"It is an interesting movie of a young boy. A little boy have an amazing gift, when he sleeps his dreams physically comes true. His nightmares are deadly and kills people. It the most scariest movie I have ever seen.I haven't seen many horror movies but, this movie is even scarier than 'Drag Me To Hell'. I think everyone should go for this movie."
" Dark but also heartwarming
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,8,I saw this today on Netflix and it turned out to be better then I expected. A couple who lost their own child adopt this kid who appears not to have a very good history regarding adoption. It soon becomes clear that the boy has a gift (or some would say a curse) for making dreams come true and often frighteningly so. This film explores loss and how different people deal with it and also gives an insight into what occurs after death. A little like The Sixth Sense and I would say good performances from the main leads and the young boy. I would say more fantasy then horror and I think it deserves a follow up movie.
" Good movie, Supernatural Horror at The Best.
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,8,"Well, mixes reviews but of course we're all different. For me this is my kind of movie, i feel happy to watch movies like this, it's not a waste of time and once you finish you can say, i had a nice time watching this. A couple lost his sun, then decide to go for adoption, they get a kid who had been in different houses before. Soon they realize this kid is special. I think the story is good, the acting is good, and most important the horror films endings are most of the time predictable and clichÃ©s, this one goes in a different direction. Good movie, recommended."
" Don't fall asleep
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,6,"And no this is not a criticism of the movie. Nor your reaction to it. While it's hard to tell what qualify as boring for some, I do believe this is decent enough to keep your on your toes (or the edge of your seat/bed), without you being in danger (no pun intended). Which cannot be said about the characters in this one.And while there are some inconsistencies throughout, and the usual ""why and who on earth would do that in real life?"" moments, will not be a big enough obstacle for your viewing pleasure. It is what it is and yes when it comes to kids, this one ranks pretty high in the horror list. The actors make this worthwhile I guess."
" Expectation free amusement.
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,7,"At some part of the movie I realized that there is so little time left and it was kind of sad. I didn't want it to over as I felt that there can be more to put into the story. As if there is a huge part of beginning and then there comes a slightly clumsy resolution to a story not in terms of the content, the kind but because it all happened so fast. Despite this, it is a descent fantasy-horror thriller and even a feel good movie.(I guess..) it is a movie for every kind of movie person. I would also like to point out that the child actor was amazing here and I'd love to see him in any other horror show as well. I can't tell whether Kate Bosworth nailed the role as she screams out as "" I'm acting !"" in some particular scenes. But there is no need to exaggerate the faults of beautifully written modest films. This is one of these modest films that grasp your attention even though it doesn't demand it."
" ""Insomnia means no dreams.""
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,10,"2014:After my nerves being left ripped by Oculas on the big screen,I decided to check what other titles auteur film maker Mike Flanagan was making. Learning that he was making another Horror movie with Thomas Jane,I started to look forward to seeing the result. Checking back over the next year or so,the only thing I would find is that the title was stuck in limbo,due to the original studio going bust.2016:Giving up on seeing a new Flanagan creation,I was shocked to see Hush suddenly appear on Netflix. Searching round for info on Hush,I was thrilled to learn that the Thomas Jane one had recently hit DVD,which led to me finally waking up.View on the film:Filmed after looking in the mirror of Oculas,editor/co-writer(along with Jeff Howard) directing auteur Mike Flanagan expands on the reflections displayed in his last work,with the use of extended sequences played in eerie silence pointing to the silent terror of Hush. Despite the studio ""issues"" leading to the main CGI effect looking a bit wonky, Flanagan delicately scatters the CGI to give the icy chills a poetic fantasy quality, startlingly lit via bright butterflies,whose colourful wings keep Flanagan's nightmare bubbling underneath .Cutting back to Shawn's death with razor-sharp edits, Flanagan expands on the blurring of reality and a horrific dream world of Oculas with dazzling tracking shots being tipped sideways by Mark's and Jessie's dream coming true.Showing a real liking for literal jaw-dropped screams,Flanagan reunites with cinematographer Michael Fimognari and co-composers (along with Danny Elfman) The Newton Brothers to fly the family into creepy horrors,sprayed with a light green and yellow over the house to give the backdrop an unsettling ""off"" atmosphere, highlighted in highly stylish shots focusing on what is slithering up the walls of the ""dream"" family home.Examining the parental loss in Oculas,the screenplay by Flanagan & Howard hits extraordinary raw power by expanding on the theme to look at the loss of a child. Avoiding the ""creepy kid"" clichÃ©s,Flanagan returns to the troubled suburban home to brilliantly look at the family unit for the first time, (which Ouija 2 would continue on) with the writers uncovering the grieving fantasies of Cody,Mark and Jessie,which hides the horror rotting the corners of their suburban home walls.Joined by Mike's son Rigby Flanagan-Bell playing a young version of him, Jacob Tremblay gives a great performance as Cody that keeps the character away from the bratty notes of other child characters,by Tremblay showing a real care towards keeping Cody mysterious,and keeping Cody's personal tragedies intact. Struggling keep things together after Shawn's death, Thomas Jane and Kate Bosworth give superb performances as Matt and Jessie,thanks to Bosworth gradually bringing the grip Jessie has held since the death to the surface to protect her family,whilst Jane casts the grief across Matt's face,as he hopes to see his son once more before I wake."
