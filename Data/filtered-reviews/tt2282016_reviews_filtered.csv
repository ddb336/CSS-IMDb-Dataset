" Come on, another found footage made for 5 dollars crap horror film!!
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,1,"Read the reviews before watching as I rarely agree with the critics especially when it comes to horror movies. They were right here this was a cliched possession story which is fine if its done well and this wasnt it featured poor effects cheap filming, lots of shaky camera close ups, stupid story. Trust me pass if you want to watch a possession story watch possession of Emily rose!! Pass on this 5 dollar found FOOTAGE camcorder filmed garbage!!"
" Good Start, Bad Finish
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,3,"A TV producer attempting to prove the paranormal is a great premise to a found footage horror movie, no matter how many times it's done. It's a great start, and this movie starts with some very interesting ideas about demons, possession and psychedelics. But instead of letting you chew on those ideas, they breeze right through them and get into some very standard 'man possessed' activity, while at the same time clumsily reminding us that this is found footage.That may be the most frustrating part of the film, it doesn't NEED to be found footage. From the start, I'll ignore the production value. A one man production team and a couple of handycams aren't going to look this good or provide us this many angles. But OK, fine, move past it. The biggest issue is the main character continuing to remind us that we're still watching a found footage movie, while destroying his house, abusing his family etc etc. he keeps needing to pop up and tell us his feelings rather than showing us. Show don't tell right!? I am a sucker for the found footage genre, I love it. When done correctly it's extremely compelling and effective. It was not effective here."
" Even for people who like bad horror, it doesn't hit
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,4,"The effects were fine, but combine the tired plot with the ""quite when talking and way too loud when scary"" thing, this just didn't land for me."
" Well done!
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,7,"I consider myself a veteran of horror flicks...great story line, well thought out! Good job"
" Cheap jumpy horror
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,2,"This is the lamest type of horror movies!!
Boring..some more boring - then my speakers almost explode with loud music and/ or scre!!Please DON'T WATCH THIS HEAPING PILE OF DOG DOODIE!!"
" Mediocre found-footage horror flick.
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,4,"Despite some effort, this is a below average found-footage flick.Camera angles and cuts kill the immersion completely. Some camera angles are so bad they actually annoy the viewer.Very basic and predictable plot.Devoid of atmosphere building or fear inducing scenes.Does not feel ""realistic"" at all, or even close to it, as one would expect from a found-footage movie.+ Main actor does what's possible to deliver given the script and circumstances, overall acting is acceptable.Although we've had good mixes of found-footage and horror (like VHS, Southbound, or even Paranormal Activity for some), this one falls short. Not worth a watch."
" Better than a lot of f.f. films. Still not great though.
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,6,Starts out pretty well. About half way through it just started losing me. Was too on the nose and it became less a found footage film and more an exorcist type film and shows the audience way too much in the way of camera angles ect. Stopped feeling like a f.f. movie.
" This scared me, worth a watch!
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,9,"There's not a lot of movies that actually scare me beyond a scene or two. But this movie really did! I've seen this multiple times with my mom, my horror movie buddy (we are brave in pairs lol). She fell asleep during the 3rd time we'd watched it and usually I'm fine but not with this movie. I shouted her name until she woke up and stayed up!!! The ending scenes too, scary, yikes! Low budget but effective!"
" Despite entertaining and having some qualities, it is unoriginal and very exaggerated.
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,4,"Films based on situations of demonic possession are something that is so often seen that attempts to do something different, even if only in the details, sometimes fail. This is admittedly the same as a thousand other films we've seen.The highly predictable script is based on the search by a recent widower for proofs of the existence of something beyond life, no matter what: God, the Devil, angels, souls, demons. What he looks for, in his attempt to deal with his grief and pain, is proof that makes him believe in something that he has difficulties to believe. To do so, he decides to film himself in a thousand and one situations: he invokes souls, spirits and demons, does magic and necromancy, goes to fortune tellers and mediums. It is a good starting point, although not entirely new. As the people say, those looking for it will find it. Of course, it is another ""found footage"" film where you can't miss that moment ""if you found this video etc."".Directed and written by David Jung, a notable stranger who never wrote or directed anything in cinema, the film stars Shane Johnson, a third-rate actor with a career in shorts and TV series, always discreet and far from spotlight. He does what he can, but the mediocre material he received in this film, which, until now, is the only one where he was the main actor, frustrates any attempt to go beyond average. It is an exaggerated, histrionic and noisy performance, which does not arouse the audience's sympathy and makes evident what will happen in the end. At a technical level, the film stands out for a dull and shaky cinematography, cold and gray colors, a warm environment that never scares even though it causes tension and discomfort and, still, mediocre visual and sound effects.There are, however, some redeeming aspects to take into account: the first is that, despite the lack of originality, the story told is logical and entertaining, proving to be engaging enough to create a tense environment, which never scares but is also pleasant. The second is that, unlike most films, it shows a lot of rituals and phenomena linked to magic or the occult, being more plural in its approach to the supernatural. The third is that, unlike most films, where the character is inadvertently victimized by a spirit or demon, the character in this film seeks everything that happens to him and, afterwards, when he calls for help, he does not receive it for what we have never seen any kind of saving magic or exorcism. This is the greatest originality I have seen."
" Boooring
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,5,"Your run of the mill possession horror with a grieving main character that makes a mess to fight the pain or contact a loved one.
That's basically it.
Very average and bland, perfect for a teenager sleepover."
" WHOA...AWESOME!!!
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,9,This little gem has been hiding from me since it came out. I just happened to run across this flick the other day on Amazon Prime after watching The Taking of Deborah Logan (Which is also a very good hidden gem). I went into this movie with low expectations and kept my finger on the exit/back button for at least the first 20min. Let's just say that my expectations quickly changed. This is one of the best possession movies I've seen and I've practically seen them all. It had a cool story and special effects were on point!
" Crazy good
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,10,"Haven't seen a good movie in a while like this before. Had me on the edge of my seat every scene! Great graphics, acting and directing. Easy to follow along with unpredictable scenes hooking you in immediately"
" Fun ride, but doesn't stick to the rules of found footage.
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,6,"This was pretty good! Story plays out in a fast-paced and exciting way. The ending was kinda meh, but that's just kinda par for the course it seems. Wasn't really all that scary either. But like I said, it's fast paced and fun.My biggest gripe is that it doesn't really stick to the rules of found footage. Lots of soundtrack music and added sound effects to build up to pretty annoying jump scares. Now if the music where ""in world"" or if the sound effects were ""in world"" (a few were but the volume was amplified for no other reason than to startle you), I wouldn't have a problem with it.It works despite it's flaws, but it really feels more like an action movie built on horror elements... if that makes sense. All in all, I definitely think it's worth a watch."
" I've watched hundreds of horror movies, especially possession and this is one of my ALL-TIME FAVORITE MOVIES!!
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,10,I've experienced a lot of strange stuff in my time traveling the United States but this is definitely one subject that he approached that I WOULD NEVER DO!! And ANYONE who does try to summon something like what he summoned is only asking for trouble! And I'm sorry but if you think this movie is stupid or dumb... you've never had anything from the other side of the veil touch you...and eating acid definitely is a way to lift the veil.... believe me I've spent over half my life experiencing the effects of acid and lifting the veil but I never lifted the veil on the dark side....I've slipped only once into the side of darkness and it's somewhere you do not want to be.... especially if you don't know how to protect your own soul from the demons who try to latch on or even invade your soul...the director definitely knew what he was doing when he made this film...so you can disbelieve it if you want but you have no idea how real this movie hits on...it's scary...I love it! Maybe if you look at it from that perspective you won't think it's so dumb or unbelievable... please don't ever try what he portrays in this movie..
" This movie is HORRIBLE typed in size 16 :D
",2020-02-06 00:00:00,1,"I tried so hard to watch the entire movie, from half I started to skip from 2 in 2 minutes ... the movie is simple horrible and very stupid.I really thought that this will be a great horror, exorcists, demons and all that stuff, but the movie is really really bad and boring.His wife died and now he wants to do all kind of demon summoning rituals to prove that are fake, blah blah blah ...but what happen after is really stupid, and the movie is pretty boring, there isnt really anything horror or ""spectacular""
The movie is very bad, is awful ... #DontWasteYourTimeWithIt :("
" Colour me surprised.
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,9,"Pleasantly surprised. I am a fan of the found footage/supernatural/horror genre, and have watched many good and not so great films. This one, I was skeptical about from the beginning seeing as the title contained 'the possession of' and there's been so many before it. Boy was I wrong.I'm not going to give away any spoilers. I will say though that this movie was great from start to finish, made me uncomfortable at the right plot points, and left me wanting more.In saying that, while this isn't a high budget film, the acting is great and the characters are played well, sucking you into the feels.Do yourself a favour, take the time to watch this hidden gem."
" Press play
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,8,"Watch this movie. Just needed to blurt that out up front so that if you read nothing else in this review, you at least saw that.I was very skeptical before watching because both the found footage subgenre and the demon-possession subgenre are so tirelessly played out. I've watched a lot of bad scary movies, but this was certainly not that. This wasn't just some barely-pieced-together B-level horror movie, this was a legitimately good scary movie.This film punched well above its weight class, given what I assume to have been a shoestring budget. The lead was fantastic, the story had more depth than most, and the transitions between frames were devilishly good.I was pleasantly surprised and thoroughly engaged throughout. Highly recommend if you're a fan of the genre."
" A ""skeptic is converted"" story hampered by the limitations of the found footage format.
",2019-09-10 00:00:00,2,"Here comes another in a long line of generic ""found footage"" films that only halfheartedly embraces the ""found"" documentary format popularized by the breakthrough 1999 horror tale The Blair Witch Project."
" Amazing and scary
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,10,This movie will make you remember things which are designed to be both horrific and intense! One of my favourite scenes from the film is when the main character goes to a religious meeting and the lady freaks out when she comes near him...
" It's not what you think!!!!
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,8,"Stumbled across this and it became a top 100!!! Not too gory which is a plus. It leaves the viewer to answer their own questions and to put 2 and 2 together unlike so many with their continued synopses throughout the movie. It's genuinely frightening without relying on shock value. It builds and builds from a picnic in the park to, well, The Possession of Michael King."
" They wasted a very good idea.
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,5,"I was really excited to watch this one. The storyline was everything I love in a horror movie. Had a good start, and although it was maybe something we've seen before, it came with some interesting twists and ideas. However, it started and never evolved. I felt something was missing the whole movie, and though it wasn't a bad one, the actors were good and had some clever things here and there, it just didn't make it for me. This was like a waste of a very good idea 🙁🎃."
" Great movie
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,8,"Great movie, a full look into the madness that takes over"
" Sucked in again
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,3,Well I read some of these reviews and went by all the good things that were said. I did not enjoy it at all. It started out ok with a good premise to the story. Half way through it was going the way of the rest of the possession movies. Very silly and laughable.
" dont believe the fake reviews this movie STINKS!
",2019-07-08 00:00:00,1,"Whoever gave this high ratings obviously was just people who had something to do with the production of this film, i'm here to bring it right back down to where it should be this movie is just awful, just plain boredom if you want to fall asleep this is a great movie to watch, if you're expecting to be entertained or scared, let me tell you...it is NOT scary, nor is it entertaining, it's possibly one of the most boring, stupidest movies i've ever seen in my life! don't waste your time, it's a huge disappointment!"
" If it's called ""the (something) of (someone)"" then it's probably trash.
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,2,"Trashy horror that is basically one guy talking to you about all his medical complaints for 90 minutes.They go nowhere interesting with this, it is overlong and tedious."
" A Faith shaking experience
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,10,"I'll explain why I gave this movie a 10 star rating. I decided that it would be a great idea to rent this movie during an overnight shift doing home healthcare, not the best idea ever. I'm not a skeptic but I also do buy completely into the whole angels/demons kinda thing. It's like the placebo effect, does it work because we believe it does or does it work because it's real. This movie rattled my personal beliefs or lack of. Do you tempt fate, try it and disprove it or do you try it and risk fate and be royally screwed if it actually does work. It's one of my top movie recommendations."
" good premise poor execution
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,4,"Having someone document his own possession is a neat idea, unfortunately this movie just didn't quite work for me, I don't mind the low budget but the film uses too many cheap jumpscares and it takes way too long to get to the interesting part as well, there's also a tone problem in which you don't know if this is something to laugh at or to take it seriously and it ends up not being satisfying in any way."
" Not The Normal Possession Film
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,7,"Michael King is a man struggling to cope with the death of his wife. He comes across as an atheist or agnostic. Atheists have faith in one thing more than anything else, when you die, that's it. There is no afterlife, no need for prayer or the practicing of religious rituals. All that is the stuff of fairy tales. Things we have come up with to help us cope with death and the stresses of day to day life. Agnostics are a bit different in that they open to the idea that something might be out there but no one knows what it is and all the religions in the world attest to that. Therefore the practicing of religion is pointless. (This is my understanding of these ideals and if I have misspoken, please forgive me. I'm in no way trying to be disrespectful towards anyone or their beliefs.) Between the two, I would say that Michael is an atheist.Michael is a man who is extremely agitated with all forms spirituality and he has taken the position that it is directly associated to his wife's death. He has decided to expose the fraudulence in the practices of religion and spirituality by recording himself performing the most powerful and dark rituals. He is smug, arrogant and condescending in his approach but before long things start to go bad and he becomes a threat to his young daughter who he has vowed to protect.At least for me, this is a different approach. Most possession films fall into one of two distinct categories. One being a random possession of someone innocent and the other being an accidental possession of someone naively playing around with dark rituals, seances or ouija boards, things of that nature. Having someone knowingly beg for possession or proof in this manner is a fresh take for me and I like that.I thought the story was interesting and for the most part, it was scripted and acted well. The special effects and CGI stuff was just okay for me. I thought they were a bit over done in a way that took away from a more realistic and frightening look. This was much more personal look into a possession experience and I liked that.This doesn't rise to the levels of being as good as films like The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose but this is a lower budgeted film. For lower budget, I thought this was a decent movie. If you like possession horror check this out. Just keep in mind that it's not big budget or top notch and simply enjoy it for what it is."
" Terrifying!
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,10,This movie is actually scary. It's fun to watch and it will scare you for sure!
" Tries to scare with volume.....
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,3,"I simply turned this off halfway through so I can only base the first half. Simply put there are absolutely no scares but what the director has done is rather turn the volume up instead in an attempt to scare otherwise.Bit worrying for people using studio monitors to listen to or headphones......Stupid gimmick that simply became annoying so the ending was not seen.I suggest to avoid and look for better if possible, Hollywood hasn't done anything worthy of ""horror"" since the late 80's or perhaps early 90's and even then relied of gore more than anything else.Go and look into Korean and Japanese horror, they do the job a lot better even though the Director here is Korean, go figure haha."
" Beware of the fake reviews, one of the worst found footage films ever.
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,1,"In the beginning, movie shows a little promise, but soon after the bad acting, bad direction, bad cinematography, bad script and very bad visual effects take over. Every few seconds, there is some extremely poor and cheesy forced camera glitch effect which becomes highly annoying. There are some completely pointless jump scares, which don't even work. The whole film feels very amateurish. I don't recommend to anyone."
" It Was Okay, I Guess.
",2018-09-22 00:00:00,6,"For a low budget film, I must say a lot of work went into it. Shane, the guy who played Michael King, basically had to carry the weight of the flick on his poor tormented shoulders, and he did an awesome job. In the hands of a lesser actor, this movie would've garnered a 1 from me.There wasn't so much on display that you haven't seen before. What intrigued me was Shane's believable acting as well as the pacing of the film. i didn't think it lagged anywhere and the writer/producer went out of his way to show how skeptical Michael King was. In the end I think it's worthy of a watch, not a must see, but worthy."
" Horror with a vein of humour.
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,7,"The Possession of Michael King: Michael King's wife dies in an accident after she follows advice from a psychic. wanting to debunk all psychics and believers Michael (Shane johnson)sets out to prove that neither God nor the Devil exist. Things don't go so smoothly though as he encounters a series of believers in Satan, necromancers and even a mortician who will provide body parts for use in dark ceremonies. At first the attempts seem farcical as police disrupt an attempted summoning in a graveyard. But during one of the rituals something seems to follow Michael back and his increasingly erratic behaviour worries his friends. Michaels sister Ellie (Ella Anderson) is looking after is daughter and is concerned for the child's safety.Nothing particularly new in this competent horror flick directed and written by David Jung (no relation) but it has more than a few scares with convincing effects. The tension gradually builds as Michael's possession occurs more more often and the spirit is more fully able to control him. Starting with dark eyes it leads on to levitation, telekinesis and abnormal strength. A vein of dark humour runs through the film especially helped by the necromancer/mortician (cullen Douglas. 7/10. On Horror Channel."
" Theme of the movie is not coherent throughout.
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,5,"I found first half of movie better, it was informative, full of mystery and revelations The character of Michael looked pretty real and determined, as the movie proceeds the things starts to get more and more predictable and that when it loses its touch. The last 25 Mins were completely generic full of all those repetitive stuffs happening as happens in a ordinary ghost movie with ghost taking over a human's body the human fights it and ultimately stops the demon with power of love. One thing that I found very unappealing is the fact that the nature of the film started with an explorative tone with Michael being a hardcore nonbeliever in paranormal. But his character transforms into something that is very prone to get Inhibited by a ghost. In my opinion if the indirect interaction between the two were shown the overall theme of the movie would have been in coherence."
" I love the story! Don't let the low rating fool you
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,7,The jumpscares are pretty scary amd the actor really did a great job love how he makes fun of it in the beginning but then regrets it immediately. Dont let the low rating fools you its a really well done movie
" I DON'T WANT TO BE DEAD
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,8,"Samantha King (Cara Pifko) is spiritual and dies. Her atheist husband Michael (Shane Johnson), who just so happens to be a documentary maker, goes about to disprove the afterlife and anything spiritual by attempting to contact a demon. He consults all kinds of people and uses drugs to help induce a mental state for the demon to take root. Sounds like fun even if it don't work out.If by chance you read the title to the film, you get an idea how it turned out.If you like possession, hand-held horror films that dig at atheists, you have hit the jackpot. This is one of the better hand held productions as the horror doesn't stem from a camera jerking around while people scream in the dark. The film shows you some pretty good rituals, the ones mom would teach me. On the down side, Shane Johnson is in every scene. We couldn't develop other characters or a subplot. He had some all alone scenes that he had difficulty carrying. And didn't we see that ending before? Gosh, what movie was that?
Parental Guide: F-bombs. Was that a sex scene? No nudity. Major league camel toe."
" Fun if slightly problematic effort
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,8,"After losing his beloved wife, a man determined to make a mockery of the paranormal slowly begins to suspect that he's being enveloped by supernatural forces out to play with him for tampering in their domain and must try to remain in control to save his family from the demons.This here wasn't all that bad of an effort. One of the few solid aspects of this one is the rather creepy work done here in regards to how the supernatural rituals are conducted. The variety of different performances conducted here, from the opening showing him subjected to the ritual where he has to be tied down and subjected to the presence of the demonic figure flashing over him to the encounter at the graveyard where he's trapped inside the coffin in the graveyard where he confirms the situation with his wife that propels him to keep going deeper into the world of the black arts, give this one plenty of starting points to get going later on with more intense sequences. Those are more prominent in the second half, where it abandons much of the rather stylish build-up in favor of more overt and obvious genre tropes. This relies specifically on the ranting and contortion he displays while possessed which has some traditional moments here, from how he freaks out on the daughter and chases her around the house to the rather enjoyable series of chase scenes featuring the deformed victim chasing others around in rabid fashion. It's quite thrilling to see this as it adds a different vibe to the film which is quite fun to see play out. That these are shown to come after the work done to showcase the skepticism he exhibits early on, from treating the different rituals with a sense of disdain or outright mockery where he's not surprised at all that the process doesn't work, creates a nice opening to then slowly lead him into far more dangerous rituals that actually do manage to prepare this one for the far more deadly preparations. As he gets swallowed up by these forces the deeper into the film and running through a wide range of experts and their treatments, it leaves quite an impression. These are what really help make this one enjoyable. However much good these positives are, the fact that this one is still quite flawed is quite apparent. The film's main problem is that it just doesn't do much of anything for such long stretches of time as he stands around trying to come to terms with the effects of the possession. A large majority of these scenes aren't in the slightest bit scary or chilling, and the fact that almost all of these are committed with the first-person camera technique examining the fake documentary approach of the whole film really takes this one down considerably by rendering most of the actions quite lame and blase. That the format itself is the real problem here with the majority of the film not in the slightest bit interesting as when it focuses on the guy going around with the camera interviewing various practitioners of these rituals or showing the daily life with his family as these really didn't need to be filmed in that manner to have their impact. It just comes off as unnecessary and just really makes this all the more confusing as to why it chose that format. Still, these are really the only real detrimental angles with this one.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and children-in-danger."
" I liked this POV choice!
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,8,"A-Z Horror Movie of the day...""The Possession of Michael King"" (R - 2014 - US)Sub-Genre: POV/Paranormal

I love possession films and this one was great...it had all the best elements. You never know which one, or what combination, caused his application. only that he was powerless to fix it.

" one of the best horror movies
",2018-06-01 00:00:00,9,This was by far the only horror movie i found entertaining from the start till the end. the main character's acting was a spot on & he did a really great job!
" A great new take on this genre
",2018-02-08 00:00:00,8,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.I won't say it was the best horror movie I ever watched, nor will I say I was totally blown away by anything, but it was definitely a great movie and I enjoyed it.So, a very brief summary with minor spoilers:After his wife dies believing that a psychic had predicted a good outcome in her life, Michael King is determined to prove that the whole supernatural thing is rubbish.While we've seen dumb people in horror movies before and we've seen the disbelieving character many times, I haven't personally watched something fully focused on it like this. It seems realistic and almost relatable in some ways, where we're looking at a character dealing with losing the love of his life in his own crazy way.8/10"
" well designed movie
",2017-12-22 00:00:00,7,"The reason this movie was good is because it reflects reality. It might be exacerbated but if this did actually happen to some one, the news would not tell you about it and if you did hear about it, it would be some type of misdirected twisted rumour. The diagnosis would be mental disability and that would be the end of the story.How ever, unlike reality this movie was more personal and instead of hearing rumours we observed Michael Kings experiences. MK started out as one who does not believe in spirits but as time went on he concentrated on spirits and eventually they became his demise through torment.MK was never actually possessed but what he was doing what is called spirit channeling, an example of that is psychography. Of course the movie actually explains what all this is and it is something that is done in real life. The scientific realm describes it as the ideomotor effect.Some may of heard of a man called Derren Brown? He invites people to do this openly. A lot of the witch craft portrayed in this film goes beyond channeling and most of it actually occurred in real life through out history, time and time again with just about all the modern and ancient cultures. Of course all this is pure hocus pocus unless these events are beyond subjective.
I think there is truth in the saying ""just because you cant see it, doesn't mean its not there,"""
" good film for peoples decide test supernatural forces
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,8,the movie very good imagine approaching the normal peoples to over Fifth- dimensional and show very good reach to 5th dimensional without mind ready how can destroy and collapse minds and normal peoples . indeed this movie very special gift for peoples that didn't know anything about supernatural forces. i believe current human science just less than 5% of universal knowledge
" One Of The Better Shaky Cam Possession Horror Movies.
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,7,"This film surprised me... and in a good way... I liked it!I was interested in the concept of the story and this brought me to view the film. A family man loses his wife and is understandably absorbed by the deep loss he feels. He believes that her death could have been negated: They had previously been to a fortune teller-come-medium who had informed them to stay at home when they should have been on vacation. Had they ignored her advice his wife would still be alive. This sets off a train of thought in his brain and he decides to prove that the occult and paranormal are not real. Being a documentary film maker he resolves to get the evidence on film.You know that he's going to be proved wrong and in a very dark and nasty way. Though, this is the case you don't know exactly what is coming. King then heads off to different people and groups who purport to be able to conjure dark entities and demons.What I liked most about this film was the standard of acting which is of a high standard. Shane Johnson does well to hold the story and the film together as the lead. His portrayal of King and the many emotions he goes through is believable. There are also a couple of actors you may have seen before - Dale Dickey who plays the Fortune Teller and Cullen Douglas who is the mortician, he gives the character a suitably creepy feel.I also loved the fact that on his visit to the Satanists they tell him what to expect from the demon he has chosen through psychography... and then we see this manifestation appear and grow slowly... then when they are later confronted we learn they never believed in it, it was just a way to get laid - a bit of kinkiness. This was just a little thing but it added a depth and a moral.The drawback is that the film is done similar to found footage films so there is a lot of shaky camera work. Though there are some nice camera angles which add to the atmosphere of the film. There's also an overuse of grey filters. I know this is to create a bleak atmosphere but it would have been nice if this could have been done differently. Coloured filters are tired and old - they need to be retired or at least take a rest. God gave you an imagination and artistic licence, come on and use it.There are some scenes that run on too long when the action should be starting to pick up and a couple which appear superfluous to the film. These just niggled me as they felt like time fillers - we could have had character and story development instead.The special effects are superb and the pentagram carving is disturbing. I don't squirm much - I would have normally said, at all - but this had me agonizing with him; so a big thumbs up for that.This isn't the best possession film out there but it is worth a viewing and I would recommend all fans of horror and possession flicks to give it a watch. I may even give this another viewing sometime."
" Greyed out and depressing
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,4,"THE POSSESSION OF MICHAEL KING is a found footage horror flick about a grieving widower who decides to disprove the existence of the paranormal by allowing a supposed demon to enter his body. You can guess where it goes from there. I was hoping for some B-movie fun with this one, but what I got was a noisy little escapade that only succeeded in giving me a headache. The main actor shouts and screams and gnashes his teeth a lot while failing to elicit the viewer's sympathy, while the rest of the movie is shot with a dull, greyed-out colour palette and a lack of vitality. Overall, the only thing this film did was depress me."
" Fast paced paranormal shocker
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,5,"When a psychic fails to predict his wife's untimely death Michael King embarks on a project to disprove the paranormal, subjecting himself to demonic and necromantic rituals. Needless to say his life soon takes a turn for the worse, with the life of his daughter and his own sanity in grave danger. The 83 minutes move at a pretty fast pace, with plenty of jump scares, demonic possession plus some decent gore. Possibly too much, these things do start to lose their impact after a while. Overall a decent enough effort, though not one that I'd care to watch again."
" Needs to be watched by more people.
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,10,"This is my first review ever so I'll try to keep it short. This is just one of my favorite horror movies ever because it's very easy to imagine it as something real, happening to a real relatable person. The reason that made me review is very simple: all of my favorite movies usually (even those that are kind of unknown) ""climb"" to the top movies on IMDb and somehow this one is stuck below the 6 star rating, so my guess is it needs to be watched by more people who are not looking for another Blair Witch to compare it to and just enjoy it for the great movie it is... it deserves a better rating!"
" Spoilers follow ...
",2017-07-07 00:00:00,7,"This contains a very good central performance from Shane Johnson, playing Michael King, who gets  you guessed it  possessed! After his idyllic life is shattered with the death of his wife, he and his two young daughters try continue with their lives. Michael decides to make a documentary, using himself as guinea-pig, to prove there is life after death, while his daughters' grieving is ignored. After various experiments involving characters of varyingly dubious quality, it would seem that a demon has gained possession of the rapidly degenerating Michael. Understandably, the daughters leave. Less understandably, despite Michael's frighteningly upsetting behaviour, it is a very long time before anyone comes to see what all the noise is about. By this time, the house is a bloody wreck.This is good, quite unsettling story-telling. Events happen at a brisk pace, and we lurch with Michael, from one horrific incident to the next. Johnson is excellent throughout, and it is just as well - you do get the impression the entire film hangs on his acting at times.During one of the hallucinatory sequences that may be a dream, a very curious thing occurs. Scenes from Richard Driscoll's notorious 2008 film 'The Legend of Harrow Woods/Evil Calls: The Raven' are inserted for no reason whatsoever. Featuring characters and events that have absolutely nothing to do with anything – which could arguably said about their context in their original surroundings – the effect is so jarring (probably because I am so familiar with the Driscoll film) that I suspected a possession on behalf of my DVD player! It is a very strange occurrence, and I would love to know why such scenes are included here – mind you, if it provides funds for a further Driscoll project, then all the better.Director David Jung does a good job with the jump scenes, and the more subtle effects are highly successful (an ant crawling out of an eye at an unexpected moment, etc), but one gets the impression that the price paid for such slick pacing is that once King is possessed, there's nowhere for the story to go other than repeatedly perverse stunts for the unfortunate titular character."
" About time something scared me. Not your average possession film.
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,8,"After being duped with the fake reviews of ""Whispers"" needless to say I was skeptical with this movie, however it's definitely worth a watch. I won't go as high as some people and compare it The Excorist because there's no comparison, but if you're looking for a little horror in your life, well..... Enjoy."
" Very good! Worth a watch
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,9,"The first 5 minutes into this I nearly turned off but was soon gripped.The story follows a man who sets out to prove the existence or non- existence of the afterlife.It has its fair share of predictable jump scares but they still manage to get you. It's gruesome too at times.It's a simple story but is interesting and creepy. There was a few moments that were frustrating...like poor character decisions, however where would the fun be if he quit while he was ahead?!As I horror movie fan, I would recommend highly. It is somewhat original. The actors are great and it has an awesome soundtrack and effects. Fast moving, gripping, jumpy and I enjoyed it."
" below average disappointment
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,4,"(0=terrible, 5=ok 10=amazingI went in watching this film with low expectations after looking at the ratings and it was as I expected, another disappointment with many questionable reviews. I'm going to keep out my review the editing, as I'm willing to understand that cgi and so on wont be great with a low budget. This review doesn't contain spoilers but plot points so if you don't want ANYTHING ruined then Don't READ.Throughout the film it slowly becomes more and more of a mess, not making sense and just getting out of control. He's meeting people which somehow know about Satan so he can test these beliefs, and these meetings are done in the stupidest ways possible, and it just gets sooo boring. During these meetings a dumb pop up will happen here and there for no reason and you cant tell if your looking through a guy in the film holding a camera, or just a camera angle, where the person holding the camera just randomly find these perfect spots within seconds. And its really difficult to care. One compliment I read was that the acting was amazing. Sorry but no. Especially when a child actor is there. this child is one of the worst actors I've seen ever, showing no care for anything. The second half of this film is just a massive jumble of things happening. I cant describe it as that'd spoil the film, but its bad (hopefully you don't watch it). It forgets that people have brains and think, no logic EVER used by the people around him. If your going crazy how about you get help. *barely a spoiler but can be seen in some eyes*""oooooh but he does"". lets say it doesn't go well there so ASKED TO BE PUT IN AN ASYLUM, CALL THE POLICE AND EXPLAIN YOUR THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS.Endings boring, you don't care about anyone in the end or what will ever happen to them. The ""horror"" scenes just become dumb, not scary, but not dumb enough to be funny. One moment I literally cringed watching it. overall its not a terrible film, but its definitely not a good one. If you've got 90 minutes to pointlessly waste feel free, but if not then don't watch it4/10"
