" Highway to your heart !
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,9,"Imtiaz Ali cuts road to define Stockholm Syndrome through Veera (Alia Bhatt) & Mahabir Bhati (Randeep Hooda) and it leaves an everlasting pain in the heart of audience for a long time .Veera is the soul,love,energy,innocence&pain of this journey. Alia portrayed the role Veera in such a way that it will be remembered as on of the best female lead roles the country has seen (not all star kids are rubbish she was like a flowing river with all emotions). She tells us about freedom,affection and love. She treats everyone equally and screams to the country that girls are much safer outside than in their own homes.Mahabir is the left over of what the dirty politics of the Great India have done to him and to his parents. Randeep was delightfully rude and angry on the film. He carried the pain in his heart for very long time and that it had changed him forever. We really wish he gets back to his Amma but as he himself said, ""he came a long way"". 20 years before he left his parents , it's been 20 years he felt affection & love .Mahabir's rage and anger & Veera's pain and silence in their own homes are similar . The director crafts both the plots in such a manner that both seeks redemption and eventually they have it.The relation between Veera and Mahabir was never romance atleast for me it was something beyond romance and I certainly don't want to insult that feeling calling it romance.The movie shows mainly North India and throws light to the dark politics of the country. The journey to Shimla was quite beautiful with it's cinematography. There was no minuses in the movie , it was a pleasant journey throughout.Watch it for Veera
Watch it for Mahabir."
" Only for Randeep hooda
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,6,AALIA was so irritating 😠 in this film. I watch this film only for Randeep hooda. Direction is overrated. Many scenes only imitiaz can understand.
" A trip to Incredible India
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,6,"Highway review:Written n directed by Imtiaz Ali, this is a ""Road"" movie involving the ""Stockholm Syndrome"". Both the genres have been explored extensively in Hollywood (Clint Eastwood's ""A Perfect World"" comes close). Back in b-town, Subhash Ghai's ""Hero"" (1983) and RGV's ""Road""(2003) had somewhat similar plot. But what sets Imtiaz's film apart are the scenic locales, Rahman's complimenting score and the breathtaking cinematography by Anil Mehta. Ali also deserves credit for extracting an extraordinary performance from Alia Bhatt. To sum it up, take a trip to this highway for Alia n the scenic beauty of our incredible India!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni."
" Super !

" Won't recommend
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,3,"Unrealistic movie,story is not complete,poor direction,good acting by actors,but direction not up to mark"
" Hopelessly unrealistic and unnatural
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,1,Not worth the time. The journey is simply unrealistic and way too out of touch.
" Every girl should watch
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,10,Girls life is gone through many unspeakable incidents...especially from intimate families.....this film tell you that story...finally it portrait a gentleman also
" Mediocre boring
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,1,"Alia is very mediocre in this
Only Randeep Hooda and music stands out
But all in all nothing"
" Beautiful
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,10,"An excellent effort.
Nothing new in story but still it steals your heart.
Randeep hooda and Alia brilliant chemistry. Both acted very well.
Cinematography just wow.
But AR Rehman songs and bgm steals the show.Classic movie in recent times from Bollywood"
" Brilliant!
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,9,"Some movie touches you and leave speechless in a way that you cannot forget them throughout your life. Highway is such a gem.
It is so thought-provoking, it makes you contemplate about life preferences.
You come out of cinema as a better person. Scenery is great, acting is superb - both Alia as well as one and only ' Randeep Hudda', take a bow, Sir. A.R.Rahman Sir's music lifts the movie so high that it becomes much more than a movie. I love every bit of it.
Thanks a lot Mr. Imtiaz for such a rare cinematic experience, Such movies make life much more beautiful."

" A must watch
",2020-03-13 00:00:00,10,"This movie shows that Money not always buys happiness instead the real happiness lies elsewhere.
A out of the box bollywood movie."
" Sensible Movie after long time
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,10,"I watched this movie twice
Caste of this movies acted so naturally from Randeep Hooda to beard guy (his partner ) performed so wellSecondly cinematography is brilliant
Every scene makes senseWould love to see movies like this in future"
" Love this Movie
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,10,I really love this movie ans the story. The site scenes. I really wanna go that place where they live for one night.
" Glorified stockholm syndrome?
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,6,"So, the movie is not bad, Hooda as always is amazing but if this was a movie challenging stockholm syndrome I would feel better. The fact that Batt looks and acts like a teenager makes it a bit awkward to watch them as a couple onscreen - it's obvious they will be paired, I was just hoping it wouldn't happen. In fact, it would make more sense if they went their separate ways without ever becoming romantically involved, maybe if she had a crush on him (hello, stockholm syndrome) and he was fond of her as a sister but was like ""bye, sis, go live your life"". It would be a good lesson and way less creepy. It's almost confusing because the movie is beautifully shot, kind of pleasant to watch, but so problematic."
" Amazing movie
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,10,Great acting.. Alia is good about.. but randeep hoda is bea..
" The best
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,10,Alia's acting a.r.rehman music imtiaz Ali taking amazing movie
" A fabulous movie
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,6,"Let me start by saying that this movie has everything right about it. From direction and cinematography to performances and music. The locations are breath taking.Imtiaz Ali yet again delivers a ""hat ke"" love story. Its not exactly a love story but a tale of two people who want to get free and experience life. Both the characters have there own painful pasts and when they come together they let it all go and try to start it all over again.Their journey is the theme of this movie. Alaya Bhatt and Randeep Hooda deliver power packed performances with a great supporting cast.The movie forces us to think about the society we live in and how people struggle to lead a normal life. Be it a rich family or a poor villager. They have there own challenges.I won't go more into the story line as that is something to be experienced.This movie comes with a message and we are left to think what freedom and liberation means.I will strongly recommend this one."
" One of the best movies of bollywood
",2019-05-15 00:00:00,10,Very heart touching movie. Loved acting of randeep and alia.
" One of the best that Bollywood has to offer.
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Highway is a movie unlike any other Bollywood movie. An ultra-rich Delhi girl (Alia Bhatt) is preparing for her wedding, and gets kidnapped in a freakish accident, by some contract criminals. They did not intend to kidnap her, she just happened to be there. One of their leaders Mahabir (Randeep Hooda) carries deep bitterness in his heart towards the wealthy, and wants to deliver this goal to a brothel somewhere far away. He is angry and harsh always, and sets off with his 'cargo' and a few other goons on a journey across northern Indian highways. But they keep away from major cities, and spend time in dusty forgotten rural villages.Over time, Veera accepts her fate, and shares something deeply personal with Mahabir. You realize as a viewer that both of them, for very different reasons, have lived their lives as tormented souls, and have deep traumas and regrets dating back to their childhoods. As the journey to the unknown brothel town continues, they form an unlikely friendship, and there are moving scenes where each let down their guard, and you want to weep for their lost childhoods.Eventually, the brothel plan is abandoned, and not knowing how to conclude this journey, they become friends living weird childhood fantasies in a remote foothill of the Himalayas, in the north east. You know though that this Utopia is short lived, and you can sense impending doom. And it inevitable collapses, leaving you feeling sad. The story ends on a somewhat hopeful note, but you will realize as you switch the TV off, that there is a bitter taste in your mouth: you can blame some obvious villains but you will realize that is not the point of the story, the point of the story is the empty facade of the rich that shackles some unlikely prisoners, and the very real horrors of the poor, and why both can never be at peace with themselves.The story was tight, with much needed comic relief in some moments and multiple emotions conveyed deftly in well written scenes. Several subtle scenes invite you to peel back the layers and understand characters' emotions - and question society, their sanity and even your own, in a few moments. The acting was beyond excellence, and Alia Bhatt is in a league of her own. Even Randeep portrayed a troubled man very well: you shrivel in disgust at the beginning, feeling fear and dread for the thug Mahabir Bhaati, but you turn to embrace him at the end for all that he has been through. There are moments in him when you see the human shine through, and that warms your heart like no other feeling.Please watch this movie - it is one of the best that Indian cinema has to offer."
" Refreshing
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,9,"A journey to find something that's already lost. Great acting, superb direction with soulful music."
" A movie worth watching
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,10,Loved this movie. At least it is different from most of the movies that Bollywood offers today.
" the single most compelling film I've ever seen
",2019-03-05 00:00:00,7,"Highway is a thoughtful exploration of two souls trying to wrestle with different parts of themselves and how they're defined. The characters who need each other's presence in order to confront their own demons, through the prism of a relationship that blossoms between kidnapper and victim. One offers freedom. The other offers humanity and forgiveness. It's a tragic love story told through a visual language that elicits a thoughtful response from the audience, as we ponder the implications of what's unfolding on screen, tackling these subjects at the same time as our characters."
" Fall in love with Alia
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,10,"Highway is Alia Bhatt's career best performance which will make you fall in love with her. All bad boys would dream to have a Veera in their life. Ending was really poignant. On the whole, you may love or hate the film but you will Alia in it"
" Great job, Thanks for telling!
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,10,"I wanted to see what this was about when I read the description. I started liking what I was seeing. I heard something that she said, I said to myself, please say something. It made me watch to the end to see if she said anything about it. I wanted her to tell, she did! I am so glad she said something at the end, even if it didn't seem to matter. It didn't matter for me either. I will say if you read this, please tell somebody even if you think it wont matter. Tell always !"
" The journey which will make your heart take a beating
",2018-10-05 00:00:00,8,"This is a brilliant movie. This is very very simple story telling in terms of the lived people have suffered.Either you wont like it , or it will be one of the best films you'll see till date. The plot takes a inconvenient turn at the end , which is although well done , could've been better. The whole movie tho is well made. This is considered as a Drama/Rom . Now i don't really like romance. But i am saying , this is the type of Rom that movies should try to discover.Superb acting by Randip Hooda ,my wholesome respect to the guy. And Alia was good too."
" Safety and freedom
",2018-09-22 00:00:00,9,"Quirky character in Veera:
seeking a simple life in the hillspast sexual abuseexperiences (initially) severe trauma from her kidnappingdevelops Stockholm SyndromeImtiaz gently subverts our notion of safety and ""stranger danger"". Randeep and Alia have given performances of their careers and are faultless. Excellent film."
" Marvellous feat
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,9,"Me giving 9 is pretty rare. 
Underrated even though with such a good rating. I believe this work should have at least 8.5. 
Great acting, great direction, great music and great locations. This movie is a movie which shows you the sites of real Bharat (India) with a perfectly composed authentic music. The movie mesmerizes you with a powerful start and keeps you fascinated but, as the story proceeds the journey of the protagonist becomes no less than the journey of the bounded audience. The journey not just shows the most incredible sites of Bharat but also unfolds each of the character and their wonderful backstories. Which makes you believe how truth varies with different people. 
Overall the movie gives a concrete statement that the true liberation lies within nature."
" Loveddd it.
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,10,"Best movie ive ever seenn. Totally fell in love with one. Aliaaa and randeepp, subperbb"
" An Off Beat Love Story Worth Watching
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,10,"Despite some of the negative reviews by some viewers, I found this moving film to be one of the best that I have had the pleasure of viewing this year. A rich, urban girl is kidnapped by rustic goons and ends up going on a dauting journey across the terrain of Northern India, which to me was symbolic of the developing relationship between Veera (the girl played by Alaya Bhatt) and Mahabir (the rustic goon played by Randeep Hooda). Imtiaz Ali introduced several social topics in this film, but the one topic that gripped my attention was the one that dealt with child abuse (both physical and mental) and its lifelong effect on its victims. Mahabir and Veera were each victims and their inability to feel a sense of belonging may have been an end result of this mistreatment. Indeed, I felt that the various terrains of Northern India from dark and foreboding, to rocky and finally to the glorious snow-capped mountains of the Himalayan Mountains symbolized the various stages of their off beat relationship; which in the end was like the Himalayas- beautiful, transcendent, deep and abiding.Rahman's music was moving and unforgettable. The many great and unforgettable scenes in this film remain etched on my mind. Kudos to Randeep and Alay for their work in this film; they are awesome performers. I found myself crying at several junctures in this film. This is one to watch!"
" Criminal mind with such Ethics - rare or impossible!
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,8,"When I first saw Highway, I enjoyed it. What the critics claimed, came to me later. I would say it to be true. A criminal with such a mind would be rare or impossible to find. Despite that what I found when I first watched the movie was that, it was entertaining.Tone, Script & Story: It's an accidental kidnap story of an engaged women belonging to a prosperous family. How she turn out to her kidnappers and finally kidnappers fate. The thing I would like to highlight hear is the story would turn out would be different by what you would imagine by above given introduction. It is what wins your heart.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: It is very good. The city, the mountain, the village, the river, it's all beautiful. It is another enjoyable treat from Imtiaz Ali. Music: Music coming from A R Rahman, it was very good as well. It included local treats. Acting: I liked Randeep most, others were good too.Final Verdict: It's an entertaining treat, if you don't go into details of real world. Watch it and see for yourself."
" An awesome Journey
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,10,There are fewer movies which takes you to a journey and you are completely transformed at the end like you fill you are there with protagonist.... One of the best acting by a leading actress
" Have a journey with them, You will feel better.
",2018-03-12 00:00:00,10,"It is my first review here although I am a regular visitor of imdb but till today i was looking for a movie which can force a lazy creature like me to write something here. I watched this movie way back in 2014 but watching it again after 4 years I cant resist myself to write this review. 
After watching this movie i am quiet sure that i can't be a writer's office work, somebody has to experience those events themselves to even try to shoot such an emotional masterpiece. If you have ever experienced lonely in your life , mark my words after watching this you would become much more stronger person than you are.
Whenever I start loosing my trust in bollywood somebody like Imtiyaz Ali and Neeraj Pandey come to its rescue. I guess that is the power of bollywood after 50 commercial movies they will produce a gem like this to compensate it all. I hope bollywood will increase it's frequency to produce movies like this.
kudos to Imtiyaz Ali.
No comments about the actors , they have produced their best and that was sufficient."
" beautiful movie
",2018-01-10 00:00:00,9,"Beautiful movie..... conveys many concepts - child abuse, city life, poverty and crime. appreciate the director, alia and randeep. camera work is excellent and music adds more life to it."
" Writing/Directing for Money
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,2,"A totally irresponsible storyline of the well known Stockholm syndrome where the kidnapped begins to identify with the kidnappers and even joins in their criminal activities. The kidnappers were even willing to shoot at innocent quick gas/shop convenience store customers and workers in this scenario. The sad part of this story is that the writer/director has no concept of what almost always happens in reality with this event. 95+% of the time the kidnapped is either dead or psychological traumatized or forever isolated from family. This film romanticized such an event. Even filming in beautiful landscapes to make it seem fairytale like. And, sadly film can be a motivator for some. Seems like this writer/director is in it for the money no matter the consequences."
" Halfway
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,6,"Good plot, had heart, nice scenery throughout the film and lots of effort must have been put in it but for every well executed scene or great dialogue there is also a bland dialogue. When one of the kidnappers shoves Veera against the windshield putting her face to face with her fiancé, the fiancé was like ""I told you so"". Was he supposed to be an ass or is it the adrenaline. How one would react in such a situation is really unpredictable, but it sets the mean-spirited tone of the movie.I am not an expert on Stockholm syndrome but it felt too early for it to set in. Without even knowing anything about her captors to empathize with them she goes back to them when given the chance to run. After all this happens only then does she start seeing the captors' desperate state. The monologues of Veera was silly yet amusing. What with all that talk about hotel check-inns, hilarious. She becomes annoying and intolerable. Talking non-stop. Then she was given a second chance at escape when she hid from the cops. The truth comes out. Mahabir was chewing something while Veera talks about her uncle presenting her with imported chocolates when she was nine while she sat on his lap. Then it suddenly turns dark when she says that the uncle made her sit on his lap in the bathroom. Mahabir's chewing paused. Apparently her mother tells her to keep quiet about it.It was a shocker. It was obviously a movie for adults from the start but Bollywood movies in the past avoided such dark themes. Lately Bollywood movies went deep and dark. I honestly don't know if it is a good scene or not. Mahabir had his own tragic backstory.Mahabir literally hands Veera over to the cops but she returns to him. They would settle down happily but Mahabir gets a sinking feeling that something was going to go wrong and then it does. A sniper shoots and kills him. Veera was rescued. The way people were shunning her mention of her time spent in captivity was really frustrating yet cinematic. Then the uncle appears. She reveals the childhood incident to the whole household. Awkward and cringing it was to watch but it was the confrontation one was looking forward to since the mention of it.The uncle gets up and leaves. Lots of crying. The plot drags on to a disappointing climax with no justice done to the uncle for his actions but the world's a dangerous place even in your own house.It was a roller coaster ride and I think 6 rating is fair as the pros only just exceeds the cons."
" Copied from Zee serial Rishtey Highway
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,7,"This story is copied from original serial Zee TV serial Rishtey.

" it was awesome
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,9,"the films takes in into the real world. i have wondered and I'm waiting for my trip... the love part of this story seems okay. i love travel side, u must watch it. the main part of this film is travel and it watch it or travel purpose only, this might be good feed for travel motivated persons ever like Vera!! the acting of the both character was too good the travel in tempo was good plan but comparing to rich it has some problem, i recommend you to travel in bike! traveling with girl is not possible as like as we think. in this film they did not concentrate with public issues. but look good film everyone must see for traveling thrust. if u seen this your leg will not be stand simply.have good journey"
