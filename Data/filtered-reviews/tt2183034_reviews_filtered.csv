" Good.
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,8,It's my favorite movie when i was 9 but now it's good
" Greatest alien adventure film ever.
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,10,"This movie is severely underrated, it's very thrilling and funny and I love it. They perfectly made it look like a kid held the camera. They introduced the characters perfectly and the way they tell the stiry is brilliant."
" a film Steven Spielberg could have imagined
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,6,"In the tradition of E.T. and the Goonies, comes one the best family adventure movies out there and yet to become a new modern classic that's out of this world. filmed in a found footage genre via Cloverfield and the Blair Witch Project along with incredible special effects that something Industrial Light and Magic would have done, the story is really decent with the sub plot of the friendship between 3 best friends long until they're about to move because of a construction project begins in there neighborhood and they go on this remarkable adventure (via the Goonies and Stand By Me) to help there new friend who's a robotic, telekinetic alien (who's kind of like a cross between E.T. and Wall-e) after receiving messages on there phones, plus the characters are decent and more stereotypical as usually including some of the teenagers who party at Tuck's house, plus this film marked Dave Green's directorial debut and despite the title wasn't shown at the beginning compared to the Dark Knight Trilogy and the Last Mimzy but it's okay in everyone's book, if you like E.T. the extra-terrestrial then you'll definitely enjoy this as well as kids younger than 7 and up."
" Repetitive storyline
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,5,"This movie is great, I'm not saying it isn't. It's just feels like the storyline is repeated, as there are so many other movies exactly with same plotline. Aliens drop, kids help, adults stop, aliens free to go. It's all repeated man, the movie's concept of spaceship lying underground was good but it could've been better. Although I appreciate the efforts made,keep up the work."
" ""Beep Bloop: Homeward Bound""
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,4,"Bad watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.I remembered this being decent the first time I watched it, but that was a Vidcon, so maybe it was the hype.This movie is an example of why people don't like found footage, just thrown together as if some stupid kid did it, and then there is active narration and editing from the camera person. That in itself isn't necessarily a bad thing to have happen, but this one is. Found footage should be found, this is more like first person account...or a fake-umentary.Echo itself (it is not a ""he"") is cute enough but spends a lot of time hiding and there is a communication barrier, but only one way. If it can connect to the smartphone, then it should be able to use the device as a speaker to express the language it understands from the kids.Alot of the movie is just young boys being defiant and ""girls have cooties, but I like it"". It fails as a ""coming of age"", it fails as a ""romance"", and it barely succeeds as sci-fi or ""evil secret organization"".This had the potential to be the next ""E.T."", but they just made weird choices throughout the design."
" For the tech savvy family
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,6,This plot are seen in many other movies like in PeteÂ´s Dragon and the Red Balloon. But this is handheld so be sure you can handle 1000 of handheld camera drops.
" It's a cute movie and my kid loves it. Why all the hate?
",2020-02-28 00:00:00,8,"When I first saw the rating for this movie, I was expecting to see something terrible. But the movie is actually pretty good. It's cute. My kid likes it. I like that it isn't animated and keeps his attention. There are some shakey camera moments, but it's being ""filmed"" by the kids as they go through the experience with Echo."
" Not a good movie
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,2,The story looks like collected from various previous sci-fi movies. And what's up with the camera. Man my eye literally hurts.
" Earth to Echo
",2019-07-31 00:00:00,4,"Yeah, the alien's cute and all that, now give me a storyline!"
" It could have be so much better
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,4,Camera never stops shaking and it just gets worse by half way through. I have labyrinthitis so had so stop watching in the middle.
" Exciting and very cute
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,8,Magnificent and very are a good the film. Brilliant plot and great acting. Everything is transmitted in perfect proportions.
" A fun adventure!
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,8,"When I first saw the trailer, I thought, ""This movie doesn't look that great"", but when I saw it, It was really cool and fun. First of all, I liked the robot Echo. Echo was so cute- looking. Second, I liked the most of the characters, the girl was really that necessary but she was ok. Lastly, most of you might not agree but I liked the CGI in the movie. It liked really cool in my opinion. If you haven't already, go see this movie. Some of you might like it, others might not, but it will be worth to watch. My score for this is a solid 8/10"
" THAT COULD HAVE GONE BETTER
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,6,"This film is basically ET with a hand held camera. Some kids get a phone signal that they decipher as a map. Late at night they take their bicycles (with bike cam) and travel 20 miles into the desert to find an alien mechanical device that needs help, but can only communicate through beeps. They go on a scavenger hunt tailed by the US government. The device can control electronics and make metal move around at will, except anything the US government uses to capture and dissect it.The film takes place in Nevada. They were able to demonstrate hand held film supposedly made by a thirteen year old is as bad as one made by a twenty something. The alien device was not exciting. Clearly a film made for targeted preteens/ early teens. Has a message on friendship.Parental Guide: No f-bombs,sex, or nudity. PG swearing."
" Inspired script that you enjoy watching (with family)!
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,8,"Tone, Script & Story: There are many movies that are based on plot that an alien is trapped on our planet earth and one or few of the earthlings help that alien get to its spaceship to escape earth. Some of the examples of such movies are Koi Mil gaya (Bollywood), PK (Bollywood), Super 8, Midnight Special, Earth to Echo and the list goes on. The first of this type of movie was E. T the Extraterrestrial directed by Steven Spielberg (being older cinema I have not watched it). For me, the script never gets old. I have liked the mentioned movies even if the difference introduced is little. Earth to Echo is one such movie.I won't get into deeper discussion as it would turn out to be spoiler. All I want to say is I like the script to build up the key to the spaceship which finally escapes. The parts moving here and there, assembling-disassembling are easy on eyes. You enjoy them. Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Justified. Assembling -Disassembling of mechanical parts is an eye treat. The alien itself appears in silver suit small in size is pleasant to watch.Final Verdict: Inspired script that you enjoy watching."
" I really loved this movie and don't understand the crappy rating.I
",2018-06-03 00:00:00,9,"I watched this on Amazon Prime, expecting nothing. I put it on the background while I was doing work, but then ended up watching it instead of doing my work. I thought the actors were natural and the story was sweet. It's really about friendship. And about kids trying to find their power to do things. I think it had several important messages. Perhaps kids wouldn't understand this movie fully until they grow up. I'm 44 and I thought it was a perfect movie for a Sunday afternoon and the alien was supercute."
" Gets worse with every viewing.
",2018-04-27 00:00:00,4,"This movie is dull and unoriginal. Its boring, has bad acting, a poorly-executed plot, and weak characters. This movie is painfully average, and not worth watching."
" Best use of Sci-Fi yet
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,10,I honestly don't get the hate for this movie. I went to see it with my friend and we both enjoyed it. It is a very awesome movie the best bit was when echo assembled his ship together and when the kids broke into the military base. Acting was decent and the spacial effects were good. I would definitely recomand it.
" Like E.T. Except Worse
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,4,"Three pre-teenage friends are being split up because of what seems to be (what I've heard called) ""imminent domain"". In this case the city, or whoever, wants to build a freeway right where an entire neighborhood is located. So they've bought out the residents in order to raze the homes and construct their freeway.These three friends decided to spend their last night together following a mysterious map that appeared on their phones. The map leads them to a seemingly useless piece of scrap metal which turns out to be more than that. What they eventually discover is an ailing alien that longs to go home.This movie reminds me of E.T. if someone used it for toilet paper. Or Super 8 if someone used it to blow their nose.Even if we take away the fact that the movie was shot P.O.V. (which is a style I abhor in most cases with the exception of Paranormal Activity and REC) the movie was still bad. Nothing in the movie made me take notice: not their friendship, not any one character, not the story and certainly not the alien. I watched anxiously hoping for something incredible or at least something satisfactory and I found neither.Perhaps this movie was something new and awesome to children but it was a big dud to me."
" The plot is good.
",2017-09-28 00:00:00,5,"The movie is good except the camera Style. Blair witch style is really awful. I think they should be remake it and film it as a movie not a mock documentary. I also didn't like the character of the Black kid, or more so his acting Style. It was as if he was reading his lines and he brought the movie down."
" Failed attempt to copy a work of art
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,4,"As the movie progresses you see that ET is increasingly resembling the ET, the problem is that it does not become good. At no time is it endearing and at times becomes boring and long.The 3d effects are superbly carried. Only in some moments they are noticed that they are 3d effects. But that alone does not make a good movie.It does not get to give you emotion in any moment. There is a moment that seems to see tension but focuses again on the guys alone and the tension is lost.It has a very bad picture, it does not accompany to create a great work. The address, as we will compare this with that of Master Spielberg. He has focused on taking the planes taken by the chambers carried by the children and it gives a direction aimless, crazy, with sometimes ugly plans. You do not see a beautiful staging, studied or cared for.It was a challenge too great and not even glimpsed."
