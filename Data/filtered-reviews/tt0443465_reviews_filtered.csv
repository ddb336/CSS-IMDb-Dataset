" Boring
",2021-03-30 00:00:00,1,Seriously boring movie that only centers around two individuals talking all night! Waste of time. Just stay away.
" BoRING soooo sadly Boring
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,3,"Worst movie ever. Terribly boring. Plot, wait what plot! Such a sad attempt at a movie. Sorry for Chris cos he's actually famous. Can't believe he did this movie."
" Unrealistic premise - Wannabe 'Before Sunrise'
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,2,"Not much to say other than the premise being completely unrealistic. The whole movie is played out on this premise of a guy trying to do a good deed and sticking with it to help her over the course of a long night. They delve into each of their personal issues along the way, but I just couldn't get past the premise being completely unbelievable and unrealistic, it was hard to get on board with the rest of the film, but nevertheless I sat through the whole thing. It's like they watched Before Sunrise and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (even stole a song from it) and tried to replicate the chemistry and complexity of those films and failed miserably. I would say avoid this movie at all costs and instead, watch either of those movies instead. Most notably, Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight if you are looking for this type of movie. Those are phenomenal."
" REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE LOW RATINGS
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,9,"Yes, I still can't believe that this movie have 27% Rotten tomatoes and 31% Metacritic 😒. After watching this movie I was like okay this movie is not perfect (you can easily see the flaws) but 27% 🤦 No, No
So, please watch this film irrespective of rating"
" The seeds of love
",2021-03-18 00:00:00,8,"The night of New York is the perfect set-up for the meeting of two people trapped in their own lives, unable or unwilling to make choices that allow them to plunge ahead and have a more fulfilling existence. Over the course of some hours, glances are taken (Brook's) and words are spoken (Nick's) in such a heartfelt manner, ultimately, giving way to the arising of new possibilities as a couple.Chris Evans' directorial debut is a gem of sensibility and commitment to the romantic genre, treating the viewer to an intimate perspective of two souls whose felicitous chance encounter has them looking at themselves and each other, while opening meaningful paths they never thought would be there to be taken.Evans and the gorgeous Alice Eve have great chemistry and play of each other beautifully, while never drawing attention to themselves. It's the message that matters, one that's eloquently delivered by this film.As a blind character said in a recent movie I watched: ""Every time you walk in this room you make me feel something I thought I never would again: possibilities."". In this department, ""Before We Go"" is unmistakable."
" Gentle romance with intelligent script.
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,8,"Some reviewers clearly have no romance in their souls by only dismissing this little gem with one or two stars. I was so pleased to sense from the start that this was not like most contemporary films. No swearing, no shouting, no crashing music, just a gentle slow building relationship between two lost souls who meet by accident at Grand Central Station in New York when a woman walking past a man sitting down, drops something that he picks up and then calls after her so that she stops. Chris Evans and Alice Eve play the couple who, finding they are caught in a moment where they can unburden some skeletons on each other and thus get some relief from their current problems, spend the night walking and talking and, obviously to us the audience, start to fall in love, although they are wrestling with their consciences and are clearly confused by their emerging feelings. To me this part of the film was the most charming and so well acted from all the little nuances displayed on their faces. This isn't so much about what is said as what their looks convey. We don't often see a film where so much time is spent building a relationship like this and I found it an absolute pleasure and I was quite smitten with Ms Eve. For years I've been a long term fan of her father, British actor Trevor Eve who i first took to in his TV series Shoestring many years ago and she's inherited much of his acting talent. Chris Evans who I had great difficulty in getting to like in those superhero roles, completely reverses my opinion in this lovely film and shows what a sensitive actor he can be, and he directed too. 8 stars from me but not for hard hearted. This shows beautifully how two people can fall in love. Don't be deceived by the comedy title above, romantic drama, yes, but not a comedy."
" the best movie
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,10,Best love movie I've ever seen. the two are perfect.no unnecessary nudity is also perfect. and love is beautiful.
" AMAZING
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,10,One of the most true and beautiful love movies we have ever produced. It takes place in an evening with real dialogues not the classic love story mushy and predictable. Delicate and very nice super recommended.
" Nice NY encounter with no sex or violence
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,7,"Very Before Sunrise but I really liked it. Maybe that's why. Just a couple of questions. What happened to room service, and where did she find the money for the train?"
" Before we go spend a night in newyork with a stranger
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,7,"A midnight adventures in New York !I know it partly drawn lines from before series, some of Allen film's. But it mesmerized me on few amusing moment's.
The Telephone to time Machine scene
(In before sunset they Both will talk kind of imagainary phones in a restaurant but seriously this is different I loved it).
And the accidental singing in scene in a party, hotel graffiti scene, pretending boyfriend one, the ending scenes.Literally I couldn't take away my eyesight on alice throughout the Film. Even Chris welly managed as a director and actor."
" Incredibly good an good acting Way beyond what I expected. True work of art.
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,10,"I was very impressed with this movie and the acting. It was one I was going to pass on because I didn't really feel the Excerpt of what it was about... so glad I gave it a chance anyway. I was in no way disappointed. This move should have gotten an award. Unfortunately, without nudity, sex and violence it didn't, however, I am a true fan."
" Romance...
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,6,"""Before We Go"" is a Comedy - Drama movie in which we watch a man helping a woman after she loses her purse, her phone and the train with which she would return to her city. A lot of things can happen or even change in one night and they both have many things to discuss.I liked this movie because it had a nice, simple plot with some beautiful scenes. The interpretations of both Alice Eve who played as Brooke and Chris Evans who played as Nick were very good and they made us feel that we are a part of their story while we followed them through the whole duration of the movie. Finally, I have to say that ""Before We Go"" reminded me of the movie ""Before Sunrise"" but I believe that ""Before We Go"" is far better than ""Before Sunrise"". I recommend everyone to watch this movie because it's simply beautiful and romantic movie that everyone has something to gain by watching it."
" Really liked it
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,9,Great characters without excessive dialog. Just shows professional critics are at times overpaid.
" ""Exceeds Expectations""
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,8,"This is my first review of any movie that I have seen. Well, the movie is quite simple, fun and adventurous. I did not know that Chris Evans directed it himself but the man has does a brilliant job. Some beautiful shots, great lines, fantastic performances. One of the movies to watch on date night or on the weekend with a loved one. I hope they make 2nd part continuing the story."
" Subverts Expectations
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,9,"I never write reviews but felt I had to for this film, it's far better than critics would have you believe. The chemistry between Evans & Eve is great & the whole film you think you know how it's gonna end & it defies traditional romantic films by not having them live happily ever after but hints to maybe just maybe they'll wind up together. It's was a great film & great directorial debut from Evans. ""Exceeds expectations"" 9/10"
" Please holy moly Make a 2nd part of this please
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,10,I'm very excited about the 2nd part rather than giving review to this movie
" It's not perfect but it's amazing for what it is
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,9,"I wouldn't say it's a perfect movie, but for what it is it's incredibly charming and really shows meaning to love in a way I couldn't describe in words. You won't regret watching it, don't listen to the critics."
" Underrated
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,9,"Chris Evans definitely did a great job as his directorial debut. This movie is so underrated. BEFORE WE GO is a movie with totally a different concept and the way 5 hrs late night romantic experience is described, makes it worth watching.
Seriously waiting for a sequel!"
" Good romantic movie..!!
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,7,"A guy and girl meets in train station then both fall in love...
Feel good movie and it explains love breakup pain...
Must watchable movie..!!"
" One of my favorite romantic & drama film
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,8,Watching this movie doesn't make me feel bored. I like the whole story I like how they talk to eachother it just like enjoyable.
" Captain America unthawed
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,1,"Perhaps it was that it was too long -- so that it jogged along lethargically, rather than racing, breathlessly? Perhaps it was that it was badly written? Perhaps it was that it was miscast? Perhaps it was that it was poorly directed?Whatever the cause, this just felt remarkably emotionless. The two leads were apparently going through some emotional turmoil and yet it felt like they were experiencing no emotions at all: all head, no heart.A very disappointing film."
" Lovelly film, a Modern Take on 'Brief Encounter'
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,9,"Capt. America proves his sreious acting and directing ability in this sensitive and very real take on two soul mates meeting, yet its too late for them to stay together.Chris Evans and the very hot Alice Eve shine in this modern version of the British classic 'Brief Encountter.'"
" Underrated
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,9,"I loved it, it's such a cool movie. There's some things that were missed, like why didn't he just charge his phone, but otherwise it was a great story. I love how the characters build up with progression of the film. You find yourself in the dilemma they are in. Do they fall in love and run. Or face the issues at hand before deciding what to do."
" 1/2 click up from Hallmark Movie
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,5,"I wanted to like this, but I found it boring and trite. I didn't feel the chemistry between the two. I stuck with it to the end but was anxious for it to be over."
" absolutely love this movie
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,9,"I watched this movie for the first time last night because its free to watch on youtube right now. Let me just say this movie exceeded my expectations. The cast and acting is great. The soundtrack is fantastic. It is an overall simple and cute movie. They did a great job of making you feel like you are literally in NYC with them. This movie made me laugh and it made me cry, the best of both worlds. It also has a ton of valuable lessons packed into it. I just love it and I would definitely recommend."
" First time review. REALLY LOVED IT
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,8,"Came across this little gem on youtube movies, free with ads. Fans of Eve and Evan's, sure why not.Rarely does a movie make me reflect on my own life, things done right/wrong, path not taken like this movie. Simple premise, but deceiving in its mystery. Ending? The answer is in the movie.Cant wait to watch again."
" It Is All There
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,9,"This may sound like a (late) copout but the first group of positive reviews nail it on this film. I found it well directed and well acted and well written; i.e., just plain close to perfect!"
" Absolute talent
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,9,"As we all know,Chris Evans is one of the most talented and loveliest actors in Hollywood and we all know that he plays a big part of the US society(he's the owner of America's ass😊),but if you really want to see he's talents just watch this magnificent movie. It's just a great journey with Chris and Alice directed by Chris himself,i recommend this movie to who ever loves love. it's really underrated,enjoy!"
" Much better than I thought it would be!
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,8,"Not sure how this one slipped by me in the past, but definitely an enjoyable little movie. Not familiar with either of the leads but will look for other things that each have done."
" Fell in love and made me believe in it too...
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,10,Haven't seen one this good since A fault in our stars and his movie is definately a classic....what I want is its second part..I want to know what happened...and if they will ever see each other again..😍
" What a movie
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,10,"Not a typical romantic movie , a work that you'll be attached to it days after you finished it , an amazing performance and great filming , with the presence of those elements you'll live an unforgettable lovely experience"
" very calm and soothing
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,6,For the people: Chris Evans was so good with his acting. The movie is very subtly calm and soothingly romantic drama. By the people.
" Love accidentally
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,7,The story showed the love between disappointed man and woman which had met in someday. It was a human chapter. They still had borderline relationship. I think it had a good at character and way to tell this story.
" Ordinary
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,3,"This story follows two people over one night. Nothing much happens. There are no major themes. It is like watching an ordinary one and half hour conversation between two people who are getting to know each other. Personally, I did not find the storyline very entertaining and I would not recommend. However, if you are recovering from a breakup, then you may find it inspirational and touching."
" A Breath of Fresh Air
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,8,"This is the cutest movie. Both the hero and heroin were superb in their roles. She needed help, and he came to her rescue and they had fun along the way. A fun movie that reflects that there are a few decent people left in the world. And both Chris Evans and Alice Eve are candy for the eye."
" Good work Chris Evans.
",2020-03-13 00:00:00,9,"I honestly adore almost everything about this film, ad I'm surprised to be saying that since I had NO EXPECTATIONS going in.Alice Eve is simultaneously charming and troubled, and allows you to quickly delve into her character, who bounces perfectly off of Evans'. She has a roughness to herself here that prevents her from being a generic love interest, and I really appreciated that. Chris Evans though is the highlight of this film; for two reasons. Firstly, his acting is stellar here; as he plays his usual charming role but with a more sorrowful, thoughtful approach. This lets him make you fall for him as Eve does, but also appreciate his sly smugness. Secondly because I've always wanted to see one of his directorial efforts, and I wasn't disappointed. The film oozes stylistically, editing-wise and has a strong flair for character and emotion; and you can tell Evans had a heavy hand in this!Music choices and their scarcity were honestly perfect. The tone was mellow but tense. The length was great. Some parts drag but in a good way (if that even makes sense?). And the idea to show this pair meet and become closer over what is almost real-time was a perfect choice for this story! I know its obviously already been done before, but I think it was done particularly well here, as development happens organically.Oh my god, and that ending! Freaking perfect! I loved it!I'm surprised to be giving this such a high score, and it might only be this high because of my initial feelings. But at the time of writing this; I honestly can't recommend this enough! Do yourself a favour and indulge in this perfectly cheesy and touching tale of love and self-discovery. I'm sure you won't regret it..."
" Surprisingly real and unique.
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,10,Well I went in to this film not knowing much about anything. Chris Evans is the man and this proves his talent behind the camera and in front.
" Modern version of Before Sunrise
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,5,Modern version of Before Sunrise that lacks all the qualities that Richard Linklater brought out the main actors.
" One of the most underrated movies of this decade
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,10,"Everyone should see this film, it's simply amazing. It's nothing like these cliché, cheesy romantic comedies. Chris blew me away with this, so proud of him. And I hope to see him direct more films. I love the story, loved the performance, and it's just amazing because it's honest.I'd say that in comparison to romantic comedies like Crazy stupid love and movies about love like 500 days of summer, this one is a mix of the two. This movie teaches you about love through love in a way that is real and pierces your heart in a slow and melancholic way. Two individuals with their own realities and completely different lives meet each other in the most mundane yet surprising way. One has everything to loose and the other has nothing to loose yet they both relate to each others' stories like no one in their respective worlds would. The interaction between the characters is cute, yet filled with harsh segments of reality but at the same time it's heartwarming- like meeting an old friend. The conversation isn't made up with perfect phrases and sentences that will make you marvel over it's poetic delivery but it's real- like the ones you'd have with your nearest friends, where it's sometimes simple and sometimes beautifully raw and emotional. The actors did a wonderful performance."
" Romance and love in their true selves !
",2019-12-24 00:00:00,10,"One more 10 star rating to add to this movie! It deserves it!
Wikipedia says that this movie was a direct-to-video and reception was mostly unfavorable ........... If in 2014 it wasn't well considered, then it would mean that Chris Evans was a visionary when he directed this movie! 5 years later, ""Before We Go"" feels so right!
I love that Alice behaves as such at the beginning, it is much closer to reality!I love the role that Chris plays throughout the movie, that is a REALLY good interpretation of how a man should behave: being rudely rejected at first from Alice but it doesn't affect his ego and still behaves as a real centred man should (joking about it and still being his true self); the only time he is being shaken up is when meeting his ex, which truth be told, is how most people who still have strong LOVE for their ex would react the same way. Making it more truthful. (No fun moment, joke moment or over reaction at that time !)I love that we don't see what they have drawn, it is THEIR moment of intimacy, and apparently either one of them have any idea what the other has created; so why should we?!I love that at the end, it is sudden; (again, it is not to us to know what is behind the paper, only her knows: maybe it is just ""I will love you forever"", maybe an address, maybe a phone number ... or another fun surprise from Nick like ""see at -train station- at -that time and date"")i love this movie for being romantic, but still very true to reality with no over drama, no over romantic, and no Hollywood style romance; in life we meet people, we attach to people, we say good bye to people ... and sometimes we meet again."
" ""I'm not enough""
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,10,"It's the idea we keep thinking about, the loud voice inside our heads that ruins our self-image, ""surely I'm not enough to be loved, I'm not that charming person, I'm not the most beautiful girl that my one would see, my talks are silly and my face is bad and my personality is boring"", here we are too vulnerable, here we can't stand if the one we chose to give him everthing simply abandoned us, letting us believe that we don't deserve love, we are too small for this.
He said ""I want to know that I'm enough, not for her but for me"" and such struggle is all what we gain after the experience..
It touched me very.. his last words ""don't tell her anything don't ruin it, just thank her that she let you know you could love more than one person in this life"", and for me, this is the best cure in the world for this case. To know, from your deep heart, that you can love more than one person in this life, and may be the other one is the suitable one."
" Simple and Deep
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,10,"Probably the most underrated film I have ever seen I definitely believe this couldn't have been more perfect The simplicity and, at the same time, depth of it all, the great actors, the perfectly portrayed emotions and feelings, the lessons we can draw from it...I could watch it a thousand times and it still would make me cry and get so touched and emotional. Chris, despite what critics say, you just nailed it Congratulations and Thank you for letting us see and feel this masterpiece"
" a movie that touches your soul
",2019-09-18 00:00:00,9,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, it's far from being cliche, it's beautifully directed, and the acting is well served, this movie explores so many aspects of love in a nightspan with the help of the two main protagonists going through such a rollercoaster of emotions, that at the end you only want them to heal each other's wounds and be happy.
And also the quotes ... it's filled with memorables ones."
" It's okay to be not okay?
",2019-09-15 00:00:00,7,"""But I guess I got to be grown up. Got to be okay with not being okay.""How can you not like a Chris Evans movie? 😍"
" Just a sweet story
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,8,"Spoilers - A man meets a girl. Right, typical love story but not. She's married and he's heart broken. They spend a night together trying to get the girl home to her husband. Chris Evans is the charming romantic guy that you expect him to be. Alice Eve is the the conflicted woman meeting a stranger but wanting to save her marriage. At the end of the day, what happens is what should happen. The hopeless romantic in me says these two people spent so many hours together for a reason and I can't hate it. For it to be Chris Evans's directorial debut I can't hate it either. Oscar worthy, obviously not but worth watching for those who love a sweet love story, absolutely."
" The movie is epic and the acting so natural
",2019-08-05 00:00:00,7,Can anybody please tell me the end I don't understand when she turns card what does that mean?
" Lost in Translation in New York?
",2019-07-30 00:00:00,9,"Feel good film.
Just watched this on Film4 in the UK.
Having been stranded in New York oneself aged 24 I was hooked from the start.
Both main characters were brilliant even though she was a pain in the arse at Grand Central Station and I probably might not have been so chivalrous.
Complicated characters keep you watching to find out truths. Funny scenes trying to make money to get home.
It was a slightly Planes Trains Automobiles ending until I just had to read another reviewers concept of 'Turn Over' meant at the end.
It's saved on my Tevo. Will watch again on a rainy day."
" Clock This
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,9,"Several people who posted here - and all the posts I read were favourable - noted similarities to Before Sunrise but they weren't really annoyed about it and are probably savvy enough to know that no one writes/creates in a vacuum and almost inevitably the influence earlier films/novels/plays had on us will filter through our own efforts. I also found elements of a much older movie than Before Sunrise, namely Vincente Minnelli's The Clock (sometimes billed as Under The Clock), a film that dates from the 1940s and features Judy Garland meeting oldier Robert Walker in Grand Central station and falling in love. Comparison with the black and white Minnelli movie more or less ends there because Minnelli fills his film with excellent supporting actors like James Gleasons' milkman and Garland and Walker actually obtain a special license and get married. I'm thinking more of the 'feel' of the film and the for want of a better word 'innocence', supplemented by charm, class, style, call it what you will you'll find it in The Clock, Before Sunrise, and Before We Go; would it wer to be found it more films."
" Good debut for Chris Evans
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,8,"Put this on as a filler whilst sick and did not regret it.
Evan's as a first time director made a good choice with his shot choices and both leads acted their roles subtly but with the power needed to not make them limp."
" The movie leaves you with very warm feeling
",2019-07-06 00:00:00,10,"I really liked this movie! I started it having no expectations but after I finished and wanted to give it a good review, I was surprised by all the low ratings it has. Def not true. Watch it, don't listen to anyone - it truly is a good movie! It is easy to watch, it has deep thoughts, it is entertaining and it just shows pure feelings of people. Will leave you hopeful and bring smile to your face."
" Wow. You know that you know, AND you don't know that you don't know... Great movie.
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,10,"Usually you know that the plot twists and turns, but wow. There are some big twists in this one. Great and good on the director. I love the angles the director gets of their faces. Priceless. It's as if you are the other person that is being talked to. You're right there... experiencing what they are experiencing. Quite the movie. I enjoyed every second of it. I thought that some stuff would happen, then it didn't. I thought things wouldn't happen, and they did. And... I thought things would happen and they did, also I thought things wouldn't happen and I was right. All in one movie! This is crazy. I like this movie. I will definitely be watching again and adding to my Greatest movies of all time list. I have a list. We all have a list. This is near the top."
" Short and amazing.
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,10,I actually loved this movie. I have never seen such.....
" Sensitive, Romantic and Sacrifice
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,10,"This is probably one of the movies that teaches us Sacrifice. It was amazing and also refreshing. There was silent romance probably the best. It reflects a beautiful relationship unexpressed. It was emotional and funny too but the former one weighin more.And the best line was ""Thank her for showing you that you can love more than one person in this life."" This was a good movie .
A must watch."
" loved it
",2019-06-08 00:00:00,9,East coast at its best. Didn't compare to other efforts w/ the same plot. The imperfections of the cast are the best part of this film.
" What an end
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,7,"Such a sentimental movie, amazing atmosphere, perfect breakup movie. But, pleaaaase. Can sb just tell me what they drew behind those paintings? And also, what did he write her on that hotel review? 😟😞"
" One for the books
",2019-05-28 00:00:00,10,"Being a Chris Evans and Alice Eve fan, my judgement maybe biased a little. But this movie hit close to the heart. There were scenes of utter silences in which no one was speaking, but the emotions said a ton. Waiting to see more movie like this one!"
" So much emotions and life changing scenes!
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,8,"I like this short dramas, it perfect example of what good acting can do to a movie. I felt like i was in that spot while watching movie, it was just everyday guy who helped this women at bad situation and so touching and lovely."
" Watch this movie before you go.
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,10,"All around great film. Great script, great
direction, great acting. The character chemistry is palpable. I don't think it's humanly possible for Chris Evans to not be charming. You want these characters to be together against all odds and logic. I mean with Alice Eve? Who wouldn't want to be with someone so beautiful and talented? It's not easy to make a heart-warming, funny, entertaining film about two people walking around a city but here it is. Don't go until you watch it."
" Surprised how much I hated it
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,1,"I love them both, especially Chris.. But this movie aghh it's just terrible with all the camera shaking all the f time 😫😬"
" Pleasant surprise
",2019-05-06 00:00:00,9,"I didn't really have any expectations going into this film, just looking for something I hadn't seen. I'm glad I gave it a shot. It turned out to be quite enjoyable. It's definitely a chick flick, but worth the watch."
" Awesome
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,10,"An excellent movie, good pace, good characters, the story's seem real, the actors did an amazing job"
" A soft and gentle touch
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,9,"It's been a long time since I watched a movie like this. I was telling myself during that I don't wanna have this ended, just continue it, this nice, soft and gentle touch. This movie is one of those reasons that why I love the Cinema!
Don't miss it, because you're gonna miss a sweet and warm smile at the end. :)"
" Not as bad as some say
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,5,"This isn't the finest film ever made - but it's by no means the worst. It's understated romance wins you over by the end. This is Chris Evans' directorial debut - I think he might have done better not to have taken the lead and spent more time behind the camera. It lacks sharpness and energy as a result.All that said Chris Evans and Alice Eve are both good looking on the screen, it's well filmed and it ably evokes the feeling of sitting around late night having missed a train waiting for something to happen.It's not a film that you say to a friend ""you must watch this!"" But it's OK if there's nothing else happening ;-)"
" An above average directorial debut of Chris Evans
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,6,"Chris Evans directorial debut before we go has its moments here and there. Story is pretty good, script is average and direction is neat. I liked the level of maturity Evans shown in portraying emotions and relationship. Climax is adequate. Chris Evans was perfect as lead and Alice eve was decent. But the movie is heavily inspired from before sunrise with only conversations going on with slow pace. Its not interesting as before sunrise. Also evans and eve lack a good chemistry which is a must for romantic films. If you loved before sunrise, you may end up liking it, but watch with less expectations."
" Loved it!
",2019-04-19 00:00:00,8,"This reminds me of many NY nights I've had. Things just happen, you just end wherever, you meet someone special and have one of those special life defining nights... I became a fan of Alice Eve after this."
" Heartbreaking but BEAUTIFUL

" Dizzying
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,6,"Ok, I get the trend towards handheld camera shots for ""realism"" but I got woozy watching this movie, especially the outdoor scenes; there was so much jiggly camera movements! Holy cow! Enough already!!!
The dialogue was too cutesy and cliche-ridden, especially Chris Evans' character.
I still gave it a pretty good rating overall. It was fairly entertaining."
" Don't Be Sad It's Over, Smile Because it Happened
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,7,"In what is clearly Chris Evans homage to Before Sunrise and other 'one night and one setting' romances, Before We Go still manages to do more than charm and romance, it brings new ideas and concepts to a genre that always seems to be flooded with cliches. I love what this film says about fate, friendship, and that life is really just a play where everyone plays their own role in an overall story. Evans and Alice Eve have great chemistry and it's brief runtime makes re-watchability feel like an easy and necessary task. I think this one has even the most cynical viewers finding something refreshing real in Before We Go.7.5/10"
" Marvellous movie
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,10,"A pieceful movie, very well played, deepening characters when it mov(i)es on. One of the best movies i've seen. Leaves me still a little bit awkward behind guessing what Brooke will do eventually. Staying with her treacherous husband or tracing her way back to Nick? The hotel evaluation note they filled in together at the hotel can be seen as leading in this riddle. In the hotel they responded on this note the question if they would come back to the hotel with: we 'll leave that open... smiling at eachother. In the train she noticed he had slipped this paper into her pocket and had written on it: 'see other side'. She turns it around and smiles deeply. Then it ends, or not?"
" This is one you will love.

",2018-12-17 00:00:00,5,"I saw both Playing it Cool and Before We Go this week. Both are Chris Evans rom-coms/dramas. Honestly, the chemistry between he and Monaghan in PIC was better than the chemistry between him and Alive Eve in BWG."

" Seriously??

" Unique
",2018-10-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie comes as a huge Surprise! In fact I've never seen a movie like this - fresh, smart, natural with incredible dialogues to quote on and on.
It is not a regular romantic story, that's for sure, its a romantic masterpiece with an oscar role well deserved by Chris Evans. The most characteristic thing about this movie is that it looks a bit like a document with a shaky operator hand, which makes it more realistic, natural, almost like you are watching the actions standing on the street next the them. Plus - these mimics, acting and looks these 2 main characters give to each other are simply stunning. One of the stories you can watch every few weeks and never get bored.
More movies like this please"

" Surprisingly moving, thoughtful romance
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,9,"This movie is very good, better than suggested by the professional critics' reviews. The premise is set early: a young man & woman have a Meet Cute / Not-Cute at Grand Central late at night, and we follow along for a few hours as they attempt to resolve their problems. I found the dialogue, the plot flow, and especially the confrontation of emotional burdens very natural, and very thoughtful and creative at the same time. The movie very much drew me in: I cared about the characters and was rooting for them.Keep an eye out for a small, but key role played by John Cullum (Holling Vincoeur from Northern Exposure). Character well written and portrayed!"
" Lovely romantic movie
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,10,"Very good movie,but left me wanting a sequel. Chris Evans was a very likable character in this movie."
" Bad movie
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,1,"Too simple storyline with not enough happening, which makes it boring. The ending is really vague. Don't recommend it."
" Cheesy dialogue but great storyline
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,8,"First off, the setting was quite unique with a more realistic view of new york than you'd normally see. The storyline and the characters are interesting, as they are dealing with adult problems and 'the real world' while still getting involved in a romantic love story. Parts of this film that i did not like, were the cheesy lines and the sometimes too-perfect acting of Chris Evans. Especially the conversations to past selves on the public telephones were just too perfectly worded to be realistic. I also would've wished there would have been a more in-depth background story of the main characters, since we didn't get too them that well. However, this film was still very enjoyable.I really appreciated the unique storyline and the many different 'real world problems' that made the movie very relatable."
" A refreshing start to a romantic indie
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,9,"Its either people don't understand filmmaking these days or they find romantic movies boring all the time, this movie is full of emotions and great dialogue, the chemistry between the 2 actors is astounding!, lets not forget about the setting of this movie."

" Honest but missing something
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,7,"At first this movie reminded me little of the movie 'Something Real and Good'. Great and natural story. I think lots of people can learn a lot from the way this man and women treat eachother. It's not like the typical lovestory, but something that can really happen. 
However all the positive sides of this movie, i do miss something. I became sad of the end of this movie. I really hoped to see how the relationship of the women turned out. If they ever had contact again. What the man wrote on the back of the hotelcard. Great, honest, real and sweet movie."

" A Night Can Change Your Life
",2018-05-02 00:00:00,8,"I want to clarify in the beginning that I haven't seen the 'Before' Trilogy, so cannot draw parallels with 'Before Sunrise'. I will review it as a standalone. That said, I'll dive into it.
Before We Go is the directorial debut of Chris Evans, who does a very decent job, I must say. The story revolves around Nick Vaughn(Chris Evans), a street musician and Brooke Dalton(Alice Eve), a painter. Both of them meet at a chance encounter at the Grand Central Station in New York, when Brooke misses her last train and she has no way to return back home (her purse gets stolen). Nick is packing his trumpet for the day, and readying himself for a jazz audition the next day. The station is closed and Brooke is left stranded. Nick lends a helping hand, and together, they spend the night roaming in the streets of New York, singing in marriage receptions, on trains, at a seers house and coffee shops.
The chemistry between the leads is not an immediate spark and flame, but is palpable and slow burning. The movie explores the perceptions of life, loss and love. Nick is left questioning about true love, while Brooke on her ruining marriage. The strangers who started off as being friendly, landed on spilling each others innermost secrets, turned each other's advisers and ended up as support. I honestly liked the way Evans handled the take on love: delicately, with meaningful perception and dialogue. Well, as Nick says, ""It is possible to love two people in a lifetime.""
Wouldn't mind a sequel of this indie drama."
" How is this a comedy?
",2018-04-27 00:00:00,1,"It's disappointing that I cannot give less than 1 star.
Just because they laugh, it doesn't make the movie funny at all.
And this movie doesn't make any sense. First, you can clearly see that he is still into his old girlfriend and 30 min later he is head over hills with this new girl !! How???
You wait all night for something to happen and for the movie to actually start and make any sense and they hint that something dramatic is going to happen but nothing is happening at all.
And they have absolutely no chemistry at all.
Very bad movie, the only good part is the guy is hot."

Spoiler
I was curious myself. I googled it but didn't find any useful answer. So I went to sleep and awoke with this possible interpretation in mind:First, think back to the scene where they were drawing on the back of the artwork at the hotel. Remember that we never got to see what they drew/wrote.In the end, as she is looking at the guest survey, and sees the arrow and instruction to ""turn over,"" she flips the card, and it looks like the word ""remember"" is there...I think he's reminding her that he has a message for her behind the artwork at the hotel (which she would also have to ""turn over"" to read). And of course to retrieve the message would mean another trip back to NYC, somehow acquiring or getting into that exact room, and hoping the message is still there.For two who seem to believe in serendipity, it's perfect. It leaves open the possibility of another adventure. And another adventure on top of that depending on what the message says.I'm pretty sure she'll take him up on the adventure.Anyway, that's my two cents."
" hoping very much
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,10,I hope this movie will be a continuation for nick and brooke ... sometime very hope. and at the end of this film is very touch when in the phone box I like the scane part is very touching. farewell and hope again they will meet again maybe in the hotel room they hahahaha thank you i love this movie
" Very Well Written
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,8,"A great film! Very well written and one of Chris Evans and Alice Eve's best. The acting is spot on and Evans and Eve have great chemistry. It's a funny film with sincere and true distresses in life, but it never becomes contrived which a lot of films like this tend to do. It stays true to itself and to life, never missing a beat. We all feel what these two characters have been through, it's a movie that will really hit home for most people watching it. I would like to see Chris Evans do more films like this, he's a terrific, and very underrated actor. Same goes for Alice Eve as well. A must see for all it's purity, sincerity and love."
" Stunningly boring
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,4,"Decent script. Alice Eve's accent is terrible. Chris Evans is a dream and totally gorgeous, she is frosty and unconvincing. Literally nothing happens in this whole film, except they seem to evade sleep. I can see what they are trying to do- but its just not interesting enough to keep my attention"
" Worth to watch!
",2017-10-20 00:00:00,10,"The movie is brilliant! Among all other movies in the box offices this one is like that rare jewel that glimmer in between of all. The movie leaves you with the feeling that things can be very simple and makes you feel happy. And it's all about us how to choose to speak and react to other people. Chris Evans did gate job - to work on something that it's not all for the fortune and glory, but for love and the simple things. Admiration!"
" Perfect movie
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,10,"""Before We Go"" is an amazing movie. So much, that I chose THIS movie to write my very first review! While you're seeing these two beautiful strangers slowly begin to unravel to one another, you also get that sense of mystery waiting to unravel too. It has the right amount of drama and excitement/adventure, while also kindling into a deeper feeling of romance and love. This is the kind of movie that takes you away...and isn't that why we all watch them? Perfect choice for the main roles too, especially giving credit to Chris Evans being the director and star! At one point in the movie he says,""Why is it that any one decision always seems too small to be the biggest decision of your life?"" This allows us as the viewers to relate in different aspects of our own lives as individuals. To me, this puts all of who I am and where I am in life on a broad spectrum based off of decision making and allows me to evaluate and reminisce. Then SHE says, ""I don't need to know my future, I'm gonna live it anyway."" When we tend to stress every ounce of the future, and so I again (personally), took that as reminder to relax..Then she further says,""You don't have to believe it for it to make an impact."" (Speaking in the aspect of seeing a psychic)...this goes alongside with a theory of subliminal messages that are real but not by choosing them to be. Ex; Like having a best friend tell you something negative about your significant other, and you don't want to face whatever it was that was said. Another eye opening quote. And the last one I want to point out is the psychic himself. He said,""You can't allow the people you love, to determine how you love."" Think about that...hits the spot! What I'm trying to say is that there are so many things to learn and endure from this movie on many levels. Each time there is an idea to fix the criticical issue she is having, they all seem to end up failing...So they're struggling, but finding that love is ""choosing who you want to struggle WITH"" sets into play. The ending initially made my heart drop once i realized it was over because it's a cliffhanger! After watching though, I'm sure we all get the picture! Overall, I give ""Before We Go"" a 10..it was simply? ...enchanting."
" Refreshing relationship drama
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,7,"Before We Go appears to be the directorial debut of Chris Evans. Having success playing Captain America, he has yet to be getting such high profile projects apart from those films or the Avenger films. This film is quite different as a relationship type romantic drama and it shows. For a film where there is mostly talking and running around from different location, it is not boring and we immediately like the lead character played by Chris Evans. Alice Eve does a good job in her role playing hard to get at first, then eventually everything comes into place as we see the chemistry smoothen.Though this film is very predictable, in that we know by the end of the film both characters will end up being together and will cause a ""meant to be with each other effect"" despite the plot and storyline having issues that the characters are married or dealing with pains from another relationship. We have seen story lines like this before in that there are little issues stopping the leads from being with each other but as the film goes, little details come out and eventually everything works for the best. Some negative reviews say that this movie felt a little unrealistic and that it seems Alive Eve's character was lying about getting robbed since the film did not show her actually getting robbed, but that made it better and slightly less predictable, in that we are assuming she is being honest but it also kept up guessing if she was really telling the truth. Had they thrown in a twist that she was conning to Chris Evans for whatever reason, the tone would have been drastically different. This movie did have a relatively low budget and it showed. Overall, this is the kind of film Hollywood rarely seems to make anymore, and we can see why the audience rates this film so highly (a 6.9 on IMDb) as opposed to critics. Recommend if like simple based romantic dramas."
" Goes on category ""1"" with no doubt.
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,10,"in my movie collection I have these categories for drama movies. they are category 1, 2, and 3. 1 is for the movies I loved, 2 is for the movies I liked, and 3 is for the movies I didn't like. sometimes when I really enjoyed a movie I had a hard time making decision if that movie should go to number 1 or 2. because sometimes I can put it in 1 just because I got caught up in the moment but when I really thought about it again, the movie isn't even that great.well, not for this movie. I have seen this movie for 3 times now and the feeling I get on the 3rd time is the same as when I saw it for the 1st time. and for that I knew I really love this movie.first of all I didn't really know that Chris Evans is a really good director. the cast is good and the characters are very well acted. but what appealed to me the most was how it is so beautifully written. the entire movie you see these 2 characters basically just talking about their own issues with their own spouses, and yet somehow it brought them closer to each other and built this unexpected connection between them. you're not gonna see some steamy acts or exaggerated conflict. but instead you're gonna see something so simple yet beautiful and honest, that will make you fall in love with the characters and the story itself. and I think that that is the essence of this movie."
" A mature story...
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,9,I don't know about the others but this movie made me feel great! Sooo lightweight... Like all the worries were gone... that everything has a reason to be... reminds me of this last when I forgot...Reminded me of the beauty of things... beauty of life... the beauty of life experiences...When we are mature... we don't act up on any minor thing... we control ourselves... this movie depicts maturity... a maturity I love seeing... the maturity that makes a simple human being a major being... that we can get so much dignity and respect out of simple acts... Maturity at times enhances and raises us so much we cant believe the impact! I know I loved this movie and I recommend it to everyone who wants the relive!
" Before we go, let's have a memorable night
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,7,"Chris Evans shows some silky talent in his directional debut, he stars alongside Alice Eve in a rather enjoyable, if short, tale of two strangers who spend an unplanned night together. After missing her 1:30 train from New York to Boston, Brooke is horrified to learn that she will be spending the night in the Big Apple, but with no money and no place to stay, she knew straight away that this would be a memorable night, what she didn't know was that the complete stranger that approached her at the station would be the guy she'd end up spending it with.Nick is a struggling musician who travels nowhere without his trusty trumpet, seeing a clearly upset albeit strong woman stuck at the train station, he swoops in and takes his chance. Before We Go chronicles the couples quickfire, one night only tale as they travel around New York like a pair of dreamy kids, with no money between them, they sure can find their own forms of entertainment. What I really liked about the film is the lack of sex, in films like these sex is generally the focal point, but not in this one, there was however a strong essence of sexual repression, but that made the story a whole more interesting and watchable. It reminded me of the films from a bygone era, where they could make an enjoyable film without any sex whatsoever.Certainly one of the better independent films I have seen for a while, both acting performances from the two leads were great, they demonstrated credible professional discipline and had wonderful chemistry together. Alice Eve has always been a personal favourite of mine and it was nice to see that Chris Evans can prove himself as a quality actor, and he isn't simply typecast as the over saturated super- dork Captain America.Set in the space of one night, it was refreshing to see a film so well made in such a tight space of time.Not world class by any stretch of the imagination, and in ten years most would've forgotten Before We Go even existed, but for what it is, it's defiantly a quality piece of film-making and all involved particularly Chris Evans and Alice Eve should be commended."
" 3 hour love story
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,7,"This movie is about two people who accidentally meet each other, after one of them missing a train to Boston. The movie revolves around 3 hours of their time together in New York City, healing each other's sorrows. Also, the starring actor of the movie is the director of this movie, How do they really do that?(I mean acting and directing together) anyway, the movie has a nice combination of comedy, drama, and romance. I enjoyed watching this movie."
" Wonderful.
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,10,"This film never fails to leave me feeling at peace with myself. The chemistry between the two main characters is natural and heartfelt. The direction is not forced in any way, and the story is simple enough to leave viewers satisfied yet still eventful in the sense that you want to continue to be part of the journey."
" Belongs to the cottage industry of Before Sunrise imitators
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,4,"There's a big problem with Chris Evans' debut. That problem is cell phones. To rewind a little bit: the film is about an incredibly handsome but sad busker (Chris Evans) working at Grand Central Terminal in NYC. Playing for the late crowd he stays long enough to see a woman (Alice Eve) rush out to catch the last train out. Her cellphone smashes as it falls out of her bag as she passes by. He does the right thing and tries to return it to her which is easy as she's missed the last train out. And she's been robbed. And being a poor busker despite his valiant attempts to be gentlemanly and help this woman this man, Nick, has no money. Also HIS cellphone is dead! And on it goes...It is perfectly plausible in real life that these inconveniences would pile up. In a movie it begins to stretch the boundaries of plausibility, especially since any person watching the film will know it's a romance and that these two attractive strangers will now be doomed to wander the city alone at night together slowly confessing secrets to one another and falling in love... Because yes, this belongs to the little cottage industry of Before Sunrise imitators. Before Sunrise for those not in the know, is a delightful little walking and talking movie from 1995. It also features two young gorgeous heterosexuals walking around a city (Vienna) and falling in love. Unfortunately for all the little imitators that have cropped up since, Before Sunrise is not as simple as it looks. It features two actors with great chemistry, a really genius script, and it takes place in the 90s when cellphones, credit cards and access to the internet weren't as ubiquitous as they are now. Unfortunately for Before We Go it really pales in comparison to a movie made nearly 20 years previous. Not only does the script not really ever get a handle on the cell phone issue (and I was reminded while watching this of Fort Tilden an excellent contemporary film about getting lost in a city where the characters have access to cellphones and ready cash and still manage to screw up their lives in increasingly hilarious, and yes plausible, ways) but the dialogue isn't that great either the reveal of why Alice Eve's character had to catch that train is dumb. The solution to her problem, when it comes, is dumb AND EASY. Chris Evans fans will be pleased though. The guy has charisma in spades and once Alice Eve's character gets over her fear that this guy Nick might be a creep rapist stalker, he's able to romance her with seductive looks. If you find Evans attractive and are willing to suspend your disbelief about how absurd a situation can get then by all means, watch this movie and allow yourself to be seduced by the romance. For everyone else it should be a hard pass."
" Lite 'n easy
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,7,"Nearly deep but drifts away when it could have got stuck in. Alice Eve just could not add a layer of drama to turn the delicate script into a serious examination of what holds hearts in place. By the end of their night the words ""Entitled whinger"" crept into my brain as her slight pout and dull eyes brought nothing. How true the words ""don't make a man your shrink"". Poor old Nick had to listen and listen. She needed passion and fire to convince the audience she was more than another princess having a naughty husband. Chris Evans acts deeply with the script but paired with an acting queen could have made a rocket instead of a dumpling."
" A worth 1 and a half hour spent.
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,10,"I am not usually a fan of this type of movies, because they usually talk to much and it gets old after a while, but this movie is the complete opposite. This movie has no dull moment from its very beginning to the very end. The dialogue was great and the acting was good you can actually see this happening in real life. That's what i liked about it the most, the realness of the movie makes it good. Chris Evans did an awesome job here. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this movie, even though the ending leaves you wanting to know what he wrote in that piece of paper, it still has a great ending. I highly recommend this movie to anybody. Even though it may have that chick flick feel to it, it's not. I give this a 10 out of 10."
" Not for the short attention span crowd
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,7,"Before We Go (2014) is an intelligent and interesting story of ""two ships that pass in the night"". Chris Evans (who also directed it) and Alice Eve play two people - each at different crossroads in their individual lives - who come across one another in Grand Central Station (New York City) as it closes for the evening.What transpires is a study of relationships and of life in general as each examines their own circumstances and those of the other. By helping one another, the two try to 'fix' problems borne of their own decisions and characteristics that have affected their personal lives and specific relationships with the opposite sex.There are several scenes in which the 'couple' has to work together in creative ways, attempting to solve a particular issue, which are as realistic as they are entertaining. John Cullum is excellent in his role - playing a psychic, no less - as one that assists them along the way.Spoiler - the interaction between the two leads is (almost entirely) platonic, which will frustrate moviegoers who expect or need more. But because director Evans really probes each character's flaws and vulnerabilities, there are truths that leave those willing to stay with the narrative very satisfied despite its nontraditional ending."

",2017-02-23 00:00:00,7,"""Before We Go"" is an unexpected gem in the countless independent romances featured on Netflix this valentine's season. This film highlights the softer side of America's favorite hero Chris Evans, who starred as the main actor, producer, and debuted his talents as a director. The film features two strangers struggling with relationship problems on their own who by coincidence find each other at their greatest time of need. The movie portrays romance and relationships that aren't just about sex and attraction, something that is overrated in the romance genre right now.The film manages the heartwarming tone of a traditional romance film, despite a plot based on heartbreak. The warm connection of the characters really boosts the overall feeling of the film. The subtle romance creates a hopeful and heartfelt experience that overcomes the underlying sad tones. The quick-moving nature of the plot made the film exciting and grasping to the audience. A subtle, yet vital, part of the light tone is the quirkiness of the characters, that makes a fun and innocent feeling, such as the characters pretend phone calls to their past selves.The film went in an interesting direction for a romance movie, in that the movie isn't about sex or attraction. The romance between the characters isn't sexual, it's emotional. The characters are both experiencing a difficult time emotionally and their deep trust, honesty, and connection help them learn from each other and overcome their challenges and in the process built a deep relationship.A struggle Evans faced as director was building the all the dynamics of the film without overwhelming the plot line. The film takes place over the course of one night and the movie runs for just over an hour. During that short period, the plot rapidly jumps between locations with little transition, making for a disorienting experience. The overwhelming number of locations was evident in the three wedding scenes, two train station scenes, a bus station scene, and many other scenes. The story got real confusing quickly.The actors gave a stunning performance; the feel couldn't have been more natural. As expected Evans played his role as Nick with grace and depth. Alice Eve, too, was spectacular in her role as Brook. The acting styles between her and Evans merged well and together created the perfect, cute romantic feeling of the film. ""Before We Go"" is an unexpectedly well-made film that reached levels of the emotional spectrum that traditional romance typically doesn't dare to go, and brings a heartwarming look at the struggle and growth of the characters. The plot is dense but still, the movie is an enjoying experience. This film is a Valentine's day must see."
