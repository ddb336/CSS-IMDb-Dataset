" Generic and unfunny
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,4,"I only recently got around to watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014). I put off watching this movie for so long mainly because of the bad reviews the movie received and because of how bad the CGI looked in the movies original trailer. Michael Bay who produced the live action Transformer movies wasn't satisfied ruining just one beloved cartoon series he just had to ruin another.This live action interpretation of the popular cartoon characters Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael is not just the worst live action turtles movie but is also one of the worst entries in the franchise altogether. This may sound like bit of an exaggeration but when you think back to the 80s and 90s interpretations no matter how cheesy or silly they were in terms of humour or costume quality, there was always something entertaining and memorable about watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In this ""new"" interpretation however there is nothing that really stands out other than the awful CGI.The turtles personalities have been watered down to their most basic character traits. Leonardo is the serious no nonsense leader, Donatello is the smart nerdy one who builds things and uses computers, Michelangelo is the loud and hyperactive one and Raphael is the moody rebel who clashes with Leonardo. That's the new turtles in a poorly written halfshell. The turtles do admittedly act a bit more like modern day teenagers but that's also the problem they act like modern day teenagers after drinking a six pack of red bull. The movies idea of humour is written more for modern day children than it is adults or actually teenagers only a young child would find this movie funny or entertaining.As you might have guessed all the turtles are animated by CGI. The turtles admittedly do look at lot more like actual turtles but sadly that leaves them looking like hideous green abominations that would have given my actual nightmares as a child. The worst looking character in the entire movie is master Splinter who looks a bit too much like a human sized rat. Splinters character looks genuinely terrifying like a five foot rat with wet fur that leaves him looking like plague rat.There isn't much fighting or action in the first half of the movie with most of first half focusing on April O Neil's character followed by an unnecessary turtles origin story. When the movie eventually gets round to scenes of the turtles fighting most of it just CGI with live backgrounds. The final fight scene between Shredder and the turtles is again just CGI and is less fighting and more the turtles getting knocked down by a single punch. The foot clan never fight hand to hand they instead use guns, bombs and shock wire launchers which makes them more like actual terrorists than a gang.Megan Fox plays reporter April O Neil and while her acting is definitely a step up from her performance in Transformers her character is written the exact same way as her character in Transformers. Megan Fox's purpose in this movie is just to wear a yellow jacket and basically be eye candy for teenage boys. There are several scene's throughout the movie that focus on Megan Fox's body for example one scene has her character jump up and down on a trampoline for no real reason. Another has her leaning out of a car window while another character stares at her behind in a close up shot. Michelangelos character has a crush on April which leads to several creepy scenes of April being hit on by a six foot CGI turtle who's character is meant to be a adolescent teenager.The main villain of the movie is of course the Shredder who's face is shown very early in the movie as just an average looking guy with some scars. After that the Shredders character only appears in the movie wearing a robotic samarai suit which is entirely CGI making the scene showing his face pointless. The original Shredder never showed his face which made the character both mysterious and intimidating. Shredders character was always instantly identifiable by his mask and deep voice in this movie Shredder is just a guy in a robotic samarai suit with a robotic personality to match.The only actor in this awful excuse for a movie that gives a genuinely good performance is William Fichtner who plays Shredders accomplice/adopted son. Fichtners character was originally supposed to play a much bigger part in the film but for some reason the script was rewritten to put more emphasis on Shredders character being the main villain.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) adds nothing of worth to the Turtles franchise which really didn't need another live action movie since we already have the 1990 original which perfectly captures the nostalgic Turtles craze of the 80s and 90s. If your an old school Turtles fan I recommend avoiding this movie if you can help it."
" Underrated
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,7,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a movie, that not many seem to like. They dislike it's story change, and how Splinter is just some rat, Megan Fox, etc. And while, I agree with Megan Fox being bad in the movie, this is a pretty good movie to just turn your mind off and watch the action. Great action and humor.
Recommend to action movie fans."
" Meh
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,4,"I only watched this because of Megan Fox (I think she is drop-dead gorgeous) and Will Arnett was a nice bonus but other than that, this is forgettable and generic. It is to TMNT what the Transformer movie was to Transformers (fortunately, she makes that movie watchable too). Anyhow, I'd suggest knitting a scarf or toque while you're watching this so at least there will be something to show for the time...."
" ""The Last Airbender"" of TMNT Movies
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,1,"I call this ""The Last Airbender"" of TMNT Movies because the amount of dislike that movie receives is what I feel for both this movie and its sequel. Never in my life had I ever been so disappointed in a film than this one. Yes, it tries something different and I can give the film credit for that, but that doesn't save this movie. The faces on the turtles are absolutely ugly and it feels like they went out of their way to make them as horrid as possible. There are several 'emotional' scenes that all fall flat, and never does it feel like there's any real danger happening. The worst of these 'emotional' scenes was towards the end where the turtles are falling and Raph decides to have this whole speech and the whole scene comes out of nowhere and adds nothing to the already lacking character development that the film doesn't have. The one saving grace from this movie is the elevator scene, which I generally enjoyed and is probably the only thing people remember about this film. Well, besides the hideous turtles of course."
" Cute...
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,7,"I love them, in fact, I only like them when they focus on the 4 and the master, all the lenga-lenga around the pantry, delicious humor, clumsy and intelligent, besides mutants, I liked the graphic and the turtles, modern and natural, true to the design .. ."
" Ignore the ignorant haters!! This movie is phenomenal especially in 3d!!!!!!!!!!
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,10,"People are always to critical , I especially cant stand the morons who say it's not believable or compare it to the other movies. Let's start by saying the obvious hey IDIOTS it's a movie about 6 feet tall ninja turtles that are superheroes!! Its an obvious fictional movie....DUH!! And it's a different era and different movie so its OBVIOUSLY going to be different from the original!! Just watch the movie and try not to think you're more talented than the director because YOUR NOT!!!! This movie was amazing, funny, GREAT action with phenomenal 3d, great cinematography, great 1 liners, excellent acting especially by the turtles and splinter, megan fox is her usual passable ok self, but this is a PHENOMENAL movie!! LOVED all of the TMNT movies but the last 2 are the best!! I love the extremely UNDERRATED Michael bay, 6 underground is the best action movie EVER!!!"
" Amazing, Absolutely Fantastic and Hilarious.
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,10,"An Absolute Fantastic Film. Highly Underrated in my opinion. Screw People that say this is Trash, This was Hilarious, Fun Packed And Enjoyable. The Main Character Incarnations were on Point. I heard a lot of people complaining About them being horrendous. But Cmon y'all, this is a LIVE ACTION film. They aren't meant to be like the 1990 Film. I Think these incarnations are some of the best from the franchise Being like there 2003 Incarnations. Shredder Looked like a Transformation though, but I really liked it because (A) Transformations I always loved, and (B) Shredder Has Always been a favourite Villain Of Myn. Splinter also looked very cool, and very wise of himself as he should be. The Cast was Very Entertaining Especially some of the stars Of this film being Will Arnett that Plays in some of the best films ever directed, as well as Megan Fox as April O Neil. I though Megan was the only Problem of the film cuz she was kinda of a jerk in this film. Thankfully, she's much better in the sequel. Now Some of the best scenes of this Amazing Film is the MC Mikey Scene(That is the film highlight of history). The ice chase Scene was Intense and kept me on my Toes, the final Fight was Epic and Insane Especially Seeing them doing the Buck-Buck Scene, Splinter battling shredder was on point and is such an epic scene, and the Best thing about this film is the ending with Mikey Singing Happy Together at the end. But another epic thing I liked about this film is the Song Called ""Shell Shocked"" That plays at the end of the credits. It was composed By Juicy J, Wiz Khalifa and Ty Dolla Sign with specials like Kill The Noise & Madsonik. The song is epic and is memorable with the turtles after saving the day. This Film is Highly Recommend For The kids especially the adults. This is a Family Movie that Is Definitely worth a Watch if Your a Big TMNT Fan. It's exactly what a TMNT Film has always been. Silly, Fun, Hilarious and Epic at the Same Time. You won't regret this. 10/10 COWABUNGA!!!!"
" Graphics and turtle animation (cgi)
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,10,"Amazing graphics and the turtles look very realistic, this movie really gives my Avenger vibes, because it has actions and great jokes, movie was just as I expected!"
" Bored me
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,5,"Flat, generic, CGI-filled. 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' bored me, unfortunately.I have a slight memory of seeing bits of TMNT when I was younger but never intentionally watched it, though have always been interested in viewing a film with them in. So in that sense, this disappointed. It just has nothing about it, no character or charm whatsoever. No reason to care for any of the onscreen bunch. Very plain.None of the cast stick out, particularly the voices. Megan Fox is probably the best this has to offer, though I didn't mind William Fichtner either... Whoopi Goldberg shows up in an alright minor role too, I guess?I found little to zero of the action scenes entertaining, not helped by some questionable editing and music. Another issue I did also notice is the humour, which falls flat at almost every opportunity - especially with the grating Michelangelo (Noel Fisher).I'll check out the sequel, because I always going to, but I ain't expecting much! This 2014 film isn't worth seeing."
" Not too bad, but casting...
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,6,"Didn't think it was as bad as many say.
It is TMNT, so it is a bit oversized and a bit overdone, but it's what one expects.
The Turtles are bigger and look like juggernauts, but why not?
The only issue is with the casting. Of course William Fitcher is a bad guy, usually is, though his performance is impressive as usual.
Regarding April O'Niel though, what was that about?
I am unsure if part of Fox's contract was the constant adoration and compliments, but it seemed unneeded. As for her character portrayal, seemed rather lackluster and forced. Would have been nicer to have a newer actress who was as ""hungry"" as April O'Niel was shown to be. Plus this wasn't the Transformers part 5 or whatever..."
" TMNT review...isn't as bad as people claim.
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,5,"The movie was good. It won't win any academy awards, but it is what it is! It is a TMNT turtles film created and assosiated with Nickelodeon. I actually liked the actors and the writing wasn't the worst i have seen. The special effects was over the top; thanks to Michael Bay. People didnt like Megan Fox as April O'Neal mainly because she didn't have red hair, but i can over look a small characteristic like that. The concept of the Shredders armor was incredible and the storyline sort of followed the Comic books. Its a family movie that will probably be forgotten, but if you watch it you won't be disappointed!"
" The devil is in the detail
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,1,"""(...) Even when the plot has nothing to do with Arabs or Palestinians, Hollywood inserts completely irrelevant Arabic/Muslim cultural indicators, often planted on the bad guy, creating a false link between evil and Arabs or Muslims. In ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" it is deemed appropriate, relevant and logical to use the Palestinian Keffiyeh scarf as a part of the Foot Clans' (Shredder's army) uniform even though the characters couldn't be any further from the Arab/Muslim world geographically, culturally, socially and politically; they were originally meant to be Japanese.

" Not great but not worst also
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,5,"I'm huge fan of the turtles and the first 3 movies but going digital is not my thing. That said, this is a ok movie to watch it's not as bad as the latest transformer movies. And the voice acting is really good and funny. Good job there. Megan fox as april is a bad cast, probably just because she was in the first transformers movie but totally out of place here."

" my childhood fav movie

we wait upcoming movie part
kindly imagine how we adore those great movie characters"
" It is not bad
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,8,"I don't get it why it is so hated the turtles were portrayed good like in the cartoons
Yeah you can say that Shredder wasn't very good but you know that Shredder is the heart of the franchise so he could not be deleted
The jokes are funny especially the one in the elevator The action is good but not the best and also don't hate on Michael Bay he is not the worst director
Overall is a good movie that I would rewatch it with pleasure"
" Very good entertainer
",2020-10-02 00:00:00,9,I dont know why there is so much negative reviews for this movie. I enjoyed watching this movie.
" I love Michelangelo
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,6,"It's not an original story, but it's not that bad ... There are scenes where it could have been better, but all in all it turned out well!
As a kid, I watched most of TMNT. So this takes me back to my childhood a bit!"
" Action - Packed
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,10,"I simply cannot believe all these bad reviews! I loved this movie.The movie includes lots of action, has funny jokes and has a heartwarming story to tell.I've been a fan of the ninja turtles since I was 6 years old.Lots of people complained that shredder looks too much like a Transformer but I like his suit!Screw the haters! Watch this movie!!! You will thank me later, trust me ;)"
" Really good action movie
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,7,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a really good action movie that's fun, funny and enjoyable. Johnny Knoxville, Jeremy Howard, Alan Ritchson and Noel Fisher are all great as the Turtles but could have used more screen time and Shredder is forgettable. Megan Fox, Will Arnett and William Fichtner are all good. The CG is impressive. Jonathan Liebsmann's direction is really good, it's well filmed and well paced. The music by Brian Tyler is also really good."

" Everything that could go wrong with this film DID go wrong
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,1,"First of all, Michael Bay was involved. So you just knew this film would be a total train wreck. It was doomed from the start and it snow-balled from there. I saw it for free and I still felt ripped off. This film is without a doubt the biggest sh!✝ stain on the TMNT franchise. Enough said."
" There goes my childhood
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,3,"The character design of both the turtles and Splinter looks terrible. The jokes are silly and the characters all unlikeable. Splinter is meant to be a loving father figure, but physically abuses his teenage boys. The Turtles have no real personality, except for Michelangelo, who is the most annoying character since Jar Jar Binks, but he has a dead ringer in Will Forte, being absolutely useless and profoundly unfunny in every scene. Megan Fox might not be a great Actress, but she is clearly the best thing in this mess.At least the voice acting is good. And the action scenes are fun in the typical Michael Bay style, which is evident all over this, sadly especially in the humor. This reboot has nothing on the classic movies from the 80s."
" I liked it
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,10,"There are lot of cliche scenes, but i liked it, cuz it's good to see my childhood with great modern effects."
" Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,4,"I've seen the not particularly good 1990 live-action men-in-suit version, and the terrible 2007 computer-animated movie, this was the third big screen attempt to bring us the heroes in a half shell, directed by Razzie nominated Jonathan Liebesman (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, Battle Los Angeles, Wrath of the Titans). Basically, in New York City, April O'Neil (Razzie winning Megan Fox) is a reporter for Channel 6 Eyewitness News, investigating the crimes of a group of criminals called the Foot Clan. She tracks to them to a dock at night, where they are raiding cargo containers. They are stopped by an unseen vigilante; April only finds a symbol left behind. April's supervisor Bernadette Thompson (Whoopi Goldberg) and her co-workers are oblivious to her story. April covers a charity event thrown by Sacks Industries, there she expresses gratitude to the company's CEO Eric Sacks (William Fichtner), who was her late father's lab partner. The Foot Clan's leader Shredder (Tohoru Masamune) is frustrated by the vigilante, and orders his men to draw them out, taking hostages at a subway station. April, at the scene, becomes a hostage herself. The Clan are taken out and the hostages are freed by four mysterious figures. April follows them to a rooftop and is shocked to see that the vigilantes are mutated anthropomorphic turtles. After fainting, she regains consciousness and they suggest she does not to tell anyone of them. As they leave, April hears the names Raphael and Leonardo. April returns to her apartment and remembers ""Project Renaissance"", her father's science experiment, which involved four turtles and rat called Splinter. April realises that the turtles: Leonardo (Pete Ploszek, voiced by Johnny Knoxville), Donatello (Jeremy Howard), Michelangelo (Noel Fisher), Raphael (Alan Ritchson) are the mutated vigilantes. But she is unable to convince Bernadette and she is fired. Her co-worker Vern Fenwick (Will Arnett) drives her to meet Sacks at his estate to tell him about her discovery. Sacks believes her and reveals that he and April's father had been experimenting on a mutagen created to cure disease, which was thought to be lost following the fire that killed her father. The Turtles' leader, mutated rat Splinter (Danny Woodburn, voiced by Tony Shalhoub), tells them to bring April to their sewer lair. Splinter explains April had saved them all from the fire and freed them into the sewers. The mutagen caused the five of them to grow and develop humanoid attributes. Splinter took on the role of their father, and finding a book on Ninjutsu, he proceeded to teach himself, then the Turtles, fighting skills. When April reveals she told Sacks about her discovery of the Turtles, Splinter informs her that Sacks turned on her father and killed him. Then, Shredder and the Foot Soldiers attack the lair, Splinter is defeated, Raphael is incapacitated, and the other Turtles are captured. April comes out of hiding and she and Raphael plan to save the others. At Sacks' estate, the Turtles' blood is drained to create an antidote to a deadly virus that Sacks plans to flood New York with, believing he will become rich from people seeking his cure. Raphael, April, and Vern storm the estate and free the other Turtles. The group escape the compound and pursue Sacks. On a radio tower in the city, Sacks and Shredder plant a device that will flood the city with the virus and Sacks prepares the mutagen blood to create a healing serum. April and Vern subdue Sacks in the lab, while the Turtles battle Shredder on the roof. During the fight, the support beams of the tower collapse. The turtles try to keep it from falling and infecting the city, while April confronts Shredder. In the struggle, the tower collapses and the Turtles pull April onto it, while Shredder falls to the ground and is captured by the police. The Turtles, believing they will die, confess a few secrets, and Raphael admits his love for his brothers, but they all land harmlessly onto the street. They vanish before the humans find them and return to the sewers, where they help Splinter to recover. Sometime later, April meets with Vern, who tries and fails to ask her on a date. The Turtles appear in a special modified ""Turtle Van"", which accidentally blows up Vern's new car. Before leaving, Mikey tries to serenade April with the song ""Happy Together"" by the band The Turtles, which annoys his brothers but amuses April. Also starring Abby Elliott as Taylor, K. Todd Freeman as Dr. Baxter Stockman and, Paul Fitzgerald as Dr. O'Neil. Fox is okay as the plucky reporter, Arnett is alright, Fichtner is reasonable as the villain, and the actors playing the Turtles are fine. I will admit I can see why it got negative reviews, it is a little bloated and overworked, but a little pop culture stuff, cartoon-style humour and fast-paced chase and fight sequences are well done, especially with the splendid special effects, a reasonable part-animated fantasy action. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay, and Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel. Okay!"
" Dissapointing remake
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,6,"I remember having Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures along with a toy Technodrome. I stopped watching that TV show around the time Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came on TV. Those earlier episodes of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that a lot of us remember when we were kids have long since not aired on TV. There were also a couple of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games I remember playing as a kid, like the 1989 Arcade version along with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles In Time for Super Nintendo. I played the 1989 Arcade Version as recently as 2006. My friend had the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game for Gamecube I think, and it had the original game. It was also at that time where the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had a newer series from 2003-2009. Now, I think kids today are familiar with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because I think there is a newer version of that show since 2012 which I haven't seen. We also remember the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies from the early '90s, where a lot of the action in those earlier movies is slapstick humor along with the turtles being played by people in costumes rather than CGI effects we are used to nowadays. They would later make a 2007 computer animated version of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles which I only saw once and didn't like it."
" Characters
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,6,"I like Michelangelo the short turtle, he the most interesting part of the movie for me. The heart or kindness is Micheangelo and it's what this movie needed more than anything."
" Suitable for teenagers
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,5,"I like comic book movies like Avengers, but I didn't like that.
The superheroes were too silly and childish for me.
For the story I give 7/10 and for the disappointing plot 3/10.
So a total of 5/10."
" Taste matters actually
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,9,"Watched this movie 4 years ago. And today again. Missed those turtles, their acting, their fighting just awesome. Although the story-line seems a little bit difficult to me, but that's not a big deal. I wish if I could fight like them! A big thumbs up for the director."
" Disappointed,Horrible,Disgusting
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,1,"How can I describe something as bad as this movie? First, I must thank the team that made the turtles and the master Splinter, because they did the worst job in the history of cinema. Do you remember the masks in the movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in 1990? In this film, the characterization was 100 times better than the 3D work they did in this film. I only have one word to describe this project: Crap"
" Saturday morning fun
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"See, Michael Bay? You CAN make a movie based on something from the '80's without ruining it. Surprisingly, I enjoyed this movie very much. Megan Fox actually does something in this movie other than sitting around and looking pretty. Will Arnett really steals the show as her sidekick and has some hilarious one-liners. Although the motion capture in this movie is incredibly creepy, once you get used to it, the movie really sucks you in. I feel like Michael Bay actually learned from his mistakes with ""Transformers"" and decided to research the source material instead of changing it completely. Although, you can tell he's not going to let people forget the ""Transformers"" movies because Shredder looks exactly like Megatron, no exaggeration. it's as if Michael Bay decided to subtly do a TMNT/Transformers crossover but left that part to himself. Although the Turtles' origins have been changed slightly (in this movie, they're April's pets who are experimented on by her father in a lab instead of mutated by goop in a sewer) it still works and didn't really bother me that much. Despite the PG-13 rating, it's quite family friendly. I'm pretty sure the only reason for the rating was because it's live action. If it had been completely animated it could have easily gotten a solid PG. Here's something I thought I'd never say about a Micheal Bay film; make a sequel. We could see Bebop and Rocksteady, Casey Jones, and Krang in the sequel. This was a great origin story film, but doesn't really have much else to offer die-hard fans.
Grade: B 8/10 3.5/5 stars"
" Awesome movie!
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,9,I don't know why people are hating this it's awesome full of comedy and action and the turtles look so real unlike the 1990 movie if you are a TMNT fan you should atlest try it
" Great! They understood the turtles.
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,9,"A lot of people my age, that grew up with the turtles resisted this movie because the turtles looked different. I don't care they still look like turtles. And what's the difference if they're mutated from ooze or from something from space? As long as they're mutated.And let's look at this objectively, we are talking about turtles, that are mutated, they are teenaged and happen to be ninjas. We can't take it too seriously, there isn't a lot to protect here.This movie nailed the characters and that's all I could ask for. The movie was fun and kept the spirit alive."
" So-so
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,6,"Fight scenes were good. Storyline could have been better. The turtles were funny and cool vfx work on them. I like Megan Fox but pity her character in this one. Seems quite air-headed with strange reaction. She's not able to close her mouth 90% of the time. Its not bad but not good either. On the grey area with... but kids will enjoy it. As an adult, I much prefer the old cartoons and first movie :)"
" Selvfish dumbass reporter April, NOT Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,1,"This movie follows April, who never were likeable in the original, and this wannabe TMNT is no different.
But compaired to the original, they choose to get rid of the great origin story, so April would have a personal connection to the turtles and there by ruin about any other connection that made the show make any sense.
And of course you can learn to become a highly skilled Ninja in just 10 year from reading books. D'oh.
This is just an embarrisment, nothing more.
I can only assume THE THREE WRITERS(really three) thought something like
""We good writers, make story gooder. 3 pea brain goodere then normal brain""."
" Die Hard w/ Turtles
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,7,It's like a Die Hard movie with turtles and it had a few decent laughs along the way. Just a combination of ridiculous action right after another.
" Not much here
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,1,Well I went into this with no expectations and an open mind. I started watching and boom whoopie goldberg was on my screen and I had to shut it off. That automatically makes me not watch so no review here.
" Entertaining on it's own merits, but underwelming.
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,6,"When the first Ninja Turtles movie came out in 1990, it was an ABSOLUTE BLAST to watch, simply because it was a faithful adaptation of the comic books with character development and stunning visuals to boot; no thanks in part to Jim Henson's workshop of wonders.I've skipped out on this movie when it was first released, but having just watched it now, I could say with all honesty that I was entertained for the most part, but said enjoyment was marred by the underdeveloped characters; just like it was in the first Transformers movie directed by Michael Bay and even though he only produced this film, his influence clearly is felt throughout this film; especially in the script, which is filled with tired, cliched dialogue and plot twists you can see coming a mile away. The end result is a widely derivative and phoned in experience.Aside from that, I enjoyed the fight scenes, which are a plenty, though strangely and surprisingly enough, aren't as numerous and overblown like the Transformers films, but they do their job admirably.But the biggest problem with the film is lack of character development. It's a shame that Megan Fox gets more screentime than the turtles; barely does Kirai and Shredder get any development and as a whole, the film feels disjointed and unbalanced. The original film had a nice balance between character development and action, something this film sorely lacks. Nobody expects Oscar-winning material in a Ninja Turtles movie, but at the very least, flesh out the characters more other than let one of them hog the spotlight for a significant amount of time.So in conclusion, I suppose the film was entertaining on it's own merits, but ultimately, it was underwhelming.Sad really, because I was really looking forward to a return to form from the titular reptilian heroes."
" Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014)
",2020-01-10 00:00:00,2,"Directed by Jonathan Liebesman. Starring Megan Fox, Will Arnett, William Fichtner, Tohoru Masamune, Minae Noji, Whoopi Goldberg, Abby Elliott, Taran Killam, (voices) Johnny Knoxville, Noel Fisher, Alan Ritchson, Jeremy Howard, Tony Shalhoub. (PG-13)Live-action reboot of the venerable franchise (created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird) about a quartet of, well, the title gives it away. Here, they're plugged into the been-there-done-that scenario of reporter April O'Neil (a badly miscast Fox) investigating strange goings-on involving the rise of a criminal organization called the Foot Clan and the mysterious, pizza-loving vigilantes trying to stop them. Overblown and overproduced action/effects extravaganza is devoid of wit and charm; any occasional clever idea, gadget or gimmick is steamrolled by garish photography, whiplash editing, and bleary direction. Never really had a chance to begin with, thanks to the truly ghastly creature/character design of the anthropomorphic turtles, but an abundance of chaotic action scenes (as cartoonish as anything from the TV show) and tiresome banter/wisecracks make it downright painful to endure at times. Should surprise no one when Michael Bay's name shows up as one of the producers.24/100"
" Amazing movie.
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,10,I think people expect more then what is sitting in front of you. Simple but with a good size budget. Cgi is not bad great cast. I think people want to see a huge plotline but that's not what the franchise stands for simple funny and action. I think they should have been smaller in size but that's my only complaint.
" It's really fun, very flawed, but fun.
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,6,"Tell me, what do you expect, is it ""The Godfather""? Or maybe it's ""The Dark Knight""? Because that's obviously not what you are going to get. But some people seem to not really understand that and come in to this movie wanting and already expecting to hate it and that, from my point of view, is a scummy thing to do.It doesn't matter if you have nostalgia for the older movies or if you hate the premise or even if you just hate action flicks in general, all movies deserve a chance, and, if you give ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" (2014) one, I think you will find there is much to like in it. It is by no means a perfect movie. No, not even close, it is flawed in many ways, it's plagued with childish humour and bad exposition scenes, but deep down, there are definitely things that work and are actually very competent.For one, some of the humour that sticks is great. I am not ashamed to say that I laughed very hard at some of the jokes, although not all.The CGI is also very good, and whilst it might be too much in your face in some scenes with the amount of explosions happening, it doesn't go for the awful trope that is shaky cam action.I did wish the movie focused more on the turtles and less on April though, I really wanted to see more of them, and even though I loved the first scene with her, she ended up being the weakest part of the film, along with the kinda of romance plot that's mashed in.Overall, please don't hate this movie just because and actually watch it to form an opinion. Thanks.C"
" 21st century TMNT
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,10,"Of course, this remake has neither the freshness nor the romanticism of the 1990s masterpiece, which I saw in a theater in New York City in the summer of 1990. Nevertheless, it marks the return of Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, Raphael, Splinter and April O'Neil with a lovely glimpse of the Big Apple and that delicious smell of pizza. Cowabunga!

" My Review!
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,8,"The scripting was damn good, specially of Michael Angelo. Megan did a fine job too. Guess some movies are better in Animated form. Not much ninja action. Nothing great about the story.Peace Out!"
" Just a bad movie
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,2,This movie and acting was so bad I almost lost my mind.
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,6,"Had some awesome, and had some sucky. had some amazing action scenes, and had some childish parts. had some funny parts, and had some corny parts. pretty good overall but could have been better. splinter is sooooo ugly, but beasted his fighting. i'm not fully convinced of the turtles' look. but it was really cool to see them finally be beasts. this movie is majorly flawed with lots of things you can pick at and make fun of, but if you turn your brain off you will be entertained, especially if for some reason you still have a soft spot for the toitles (2 viewings)"
" A tense bit dissapointing
",2019-04-19 00:00:00,4,"When I heard about this movie, I was excited to see the turtles back on the big screen! Unfortunately, when I left the movie proved to bee not all its cracked up to be. One issue I have with the film id that it gives 90 % of the screen time to Megan fox. I have nothing against Fox or the character of April, but this is about the turtles, therefore, most of the screen-time should be given to the heroes in a half-shell and April being in a more supporting role. Another thing i didn't like was that William Fintchhner is not the Shredder like early reports said he was going to be and the real shredder instead is kept in the shadows for most of the film except for 3 fight scens. The last issue I have is with the story and speacial effects. The turtles don't really look like ninja turtles more like a seas monster group. So the mocap wasn't so great and the story wasn't engaging enough and was honestly pretty boring. So yeah this film is not the best TMNT film made sadly."
" This one is really ordinary.
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,5,"The image of the mouse teacher is too bad. Feeling that fox's image was completely destroyed, I couldn't bear to look straight at it. I don't know if there will be a sequel."
" Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is definitely not ""turtle-y"" awesome.
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,4,"Whilst not directed by Michael Bay, his hand in the production team is clearly noticeable right from the first diagonal shot plagued with lens flares and...oh, would you look at that! Explosions! Now, I'm not the biggest fan of the source material, so was hoping for fresh adaptation with some genuine wit and memorability. Alas, it's just another loud disposable blockbuster that is infected with poor editing and minimal characterisation. New York is under threat by a clan that will soon destroy the city and its inhabitants. But four mutant turtles team up with a news reporter to stop the antagonising Shredder. Michelangelo, bam! Raphael, woosh! Donatello, kapow! And Leonardo, DiCaprio! Four hideously designed ""ninja mutant turtle teenagers"" that surprisingly have minimal character development and come across as annoying irritants (even more so than Megan Fox!). Speaking of, it's another case of good looks overwhelming acting ability because April O'Neil was absolutely useless at her job, constantly screamed at everything and was more of a lead character in comparison to the eponymous turtles. Splinter shows up for a wonderful ten minute scene of exposition, and then bites the dust whilst generating no emotional investment. Villain also makes the classic move of unveiling his plans to the heroes so that they can stop him. Eyes certainly rolled at that point. Some of the action scenes, such as the downhill mountain chase, were well edited and exciting. However the close combat sequences in the sewers were murky, poorly edited and nearly impossible to watch. The dialogue tried too hard at being funny, and ultimately failed. Although some of the conversations between the turtles did feel natural and gave them a sense a unity and family. Oh, and Whoopi Goldberg has a few lines! Why? No idea. Look, it's not a terrible film, but it's obvious that the target demographic is for younger audiences (despite its certification). Obnoxiously loud with only one or two scenes of pure entertainment."
" Nothing would change my happy memories of the TMNT no matter what.
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,2,"Having said that: why on earth would you make the turtles monstrosities? Why would you make them so ugly? Why would you make them with different body types? Why would you make them with so inmense that hiding gets even more implausible?ALL THE TURTLES ARE GOOD AT FIGHTING!
DONATELLO IS THE TECH GUY, BUT HE'S NOT A NERD!
RALPH IS THE MOST SARCASTIC, BUT NOT THIS FOOTBALL PLAYER DUMB BULLY!Or maybe they are taking inspiration on the newer cartoons, and in that case, I consider that decision quite dumb.Besides all of that, the movie is terrible in all they Michael Bay ways, with a weak script, terrible dialogue and worse jokes (and offensive), and a lead being a beautiful young woman (Megan Fox) incapable of lead anything with her acting skills. In this case Bay is just the producer and the director is Jonathan Liebesman, the guy that brought us the ""genious work"" Battle Los Angeles and Wrath of the Titans. Yeap. So, a big ""No"" to this. Painfully it took a sequel for this to end."

",2018-12-21 00:00:00,8,"Grew up watching tmnt cartoon and I absolutely liked it though Michaelangelo was a bit let down. Great action, surely a visual treat"
" Not as bad as they say.
",2018-11-12 00:00:00,6,"This new installment in the popular ""TMNT"" franchise might not win over many hard-core fans, but for more casual viewers, it is just an okay action comedy. The performances, plot and comedy are what you would expect from a movie about the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"". Ever if there is a lot to complain about, it still is just one of these movie you are going to watch with a bunch of friend while eating some pizza."
" Micheal bay must stop whatever he is doing
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,3,"This movie is really bad and let me tell you why.COMEDY
The humor is really cheap and lame and doesn't have any thought brought into it.
Ik this movie is for teenage boys but that isn't an excuse to the cheap and lazy humor.
EXAMPLE: When Vernon talked to April about being a serious reporter instead of making that joke short and simple they drag it out longer than it needs and that makes you pay more attention to it and see how bad that joke is.
EXAMPLE 2: Mickey farting isn't funny, fart jokes aren't funny for adults or teens it's just lazily written humor.DIALOGUE
The dialogue is cliche and boring especially when shredder speaks cause he says tons of cliche villain stuff like ""The Insert evil group here will rise again"", ""Your men are weak"", ""It's no surprise your mission failed"", ""No one will stop us in our quest
to reclaim victory"" or ""We will own this city"" those are a lot of cliche lines right there.
And also a small thing how can Shredder say that the Foot clan will rise again when they are never even defeated. They are big news out there and Shredder is acting like the foot clan are dead.
And the movie has also a problem explaining what we have already seen
EXAMPLE: They show how April wants to be a serious reporter but later Vernon says that April wants to be a serious reporter.
We already knew that but the people making this film think we are stupid so they explain everything we already know.
There are more examples of moments where they explain stuff we already know.CGI
The CGI isn't good.
The turtles look weird and unnatural and there are moments in the movie that you can clearly see are CGI.
It's often that the Action scenes are 100% CGI and if they are not then it's a lot of shaky cam.CHARACTERS
All the characters are one dimensional.
April the bland character who doesn't show any emotion at all.
They SAY in the movie that she has a deep connection to the turtles but she doesn't act like she has a deep connection to the turtles and Splinter, she barely speaks to them at all but the reason they SAY that she has a deep connection to the turtles and Splinter is because of plot convenience.
The turtles are also one dimensional.
Donatello the super smart nerdy boy, Leonardo the serious leader, Mickey the annoying comic relief who has a crush on April, Raphael is the only one in the team who has a little bit more depth but its not a lot of depth he has he is just the guy who acts tuff so he can hide his emotions.
They all act how they should act in TMNT but the problem is that they lack depth.
Splinter is the one dimensional wise sensei and they completely ignore the relationship he had with shredder which is wrong.ACTION
The action scene is a CGI mess if not then its a lot of shaky cam.
There are moments when the turtle fight that i'm like ""Oh that's pretty cool"" but those moments happened three times only.
When action scenes come the resolution to those action scenes are stupid.
EXAMPLE: When 3 of the turtles where captured, April Vernon and Raph broke into Eric Sacks house Eric sacks left Shredder to take care of everything Raph fought Shredder while April and Vernon stood there for awhile Shredder only fought Raph and didn't have any foot clan soldiers to back him up, April pressed random buttons and somehow managed to put Adrenaline so that the turtles could be strong again. and then Shredder left after Recking Raph.
I have another example which i will address later.VILLAINS
Shredder is the worst villain i have ever seen, he barely talks through out the movie and when he does it's cliche dialogue.
Shredder is a really important villain and just making him this small not really that important villain is wrong and stupid.
Eric Sacks is a bad villain but not as bad as Shredder.
All he wants to do is become rich the plan might sound smart but it's really not that smart and his motivation is weak and in the end of the Final battle he is just not that important anymore.FINAL ACT
This is the other example i'm gonna address
The final act was pretty bad.
instead of finding a clever way of defeating Shredder they hurt him by playing buk buk and then later April kicks shredder in the face. That just makes Shredder weak.
And also when the tower falls apart they try to have stakes by saying that If the spire falls and the toxin makes ground impact, it'll contaminate a 10-block radius.
And their chance of succeeding is 0.00000000003% so that means that it's almost impossible for them to succeed.
The reason they did that is so that there could be stakes but you don't need to do it like that it just sounds stupid and it's obvious that they will succeed.
They could just say there is a 40% chance that they will succeed or less.
And when the tower hits the ground they forgot all about the 10 lock radius stuff but remember plot convenience.VERDICT
Is a CGI mess with a bunch of one dimensional characters and a poorly written story with poorly written characters.
Don't watch this movie"
" A sloppy, half-baked version of the story we already know
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,4,"Michael Bay's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is basically unnecessary. This movie doesn't really offer anything new. It just gives us a sloppy, half-baked version of the story we already know with minor and annoying changes. Bay just throws in his trademarked visual noise to make it seem more interesting than it actually is. That's not to say there aren't some fun parts in this movie, there are, but the original live-action TMNT movies are far better."
" This is not an adaptation of the Turtles I remember as a kid.
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,2,This is a turd of a movie and I say this as a massive TMNT fan(especially of that 80s cartoon series). The turtles aren't friendly- they actually look menacing and quite frankly- creepy. April O Neill played with aplomb by Megan Fox who is subjected to so many voyeuristic shots of her body that I expected the makers of this travesty to put forth a disclaimer at the start: Not to be seen by feminists. But then this is the kind of subject no feminist would rather watch. The action- much like all of Bay's films is so fast and joyously edited that you forget who is who. It begins and ends and that is it. If you are a fan of the cartoon you will be borderline suicidal. If you are a new inquisitive to the turtle phenomenon you'd be bored and wondering when the interval will happen. This is one film you should definitely miss.
" Great entertainment
",2018-06-06 00:00:00,7,"What do people expect? This film doesn't try to be anything it isn't, just a good old fashioned entertaining action film, if you have been a fan of the Turtles you will enjoy this. Even if you aren't familiar and just want an hour and a half of popcorn entertainment then this is perfect, I really enjoyed it."
" The best Turtles movie!
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,7,"I was very surprised that I actually enjoyed the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie. I walked in with low expectations and found it well written and with cool action scenes and laughs. It finally told us back story of where the Turtles came from, how the ooze was invented and what Shredder and April O'Neil had to do with this. This is the first time I can actually say I enjoyed a Ninja Turtles movie!"
" Great modernization of a classic franchise.
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,8,I really enjoyed this movie despite it almost being ruined by Whoopi Goldberg's terrible acting. How does someone so awful keep getting cast in films. Thankfully her scenes are over quickly and Megan Fox performs wonderfully in one of her best roles thus far. The graphics of the turtles are amazing and definite eye candy.
" Great!
",2018-03-06 00:00:00,10,"I do not understand why it was so low. The film is great. Visual effects, vocals, sound effects, acting are at a high level. As good as Transformers."
" Totally awesome
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,10,"Im an old fan of TMNT.i dont know why there are so much bad reviews,
this is awesome"
" Shamefully bad
",2018-02-20 00:00:00,3,"TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES is a shamefully bad Hollywood comic book blockbuster produced by Michael Bay, who really should know better. I'm a fan of the 1980s TV series but this is nothing like that show and instead an example of the usual soulless, mindless, unoriginal trash currently filling cinemas. Gone has the look, warmth, and humour of the turtles themselves, to be replaced by motion captured CGI hulks who make incessant and deeply unfunny one-liner jokes whenever they're on screen. Watching their supposed 'camaraderie' is an embarrassment and don't get me started on the voice acting. Megan Fox shows up to remind you why she's never had a 'proper' Hollywood career while others like William Fichtner should really know better. As with all films like this, things start off slow but by the end it's turned into one giant, aimless, generic-feeling CGI action set-piece spectacular that just goes on and on and on."
" Be one with the blade
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,10,"This is a film I had put off watching for two reasons. The first was that I didn't grow up this this series. While I was familiar with it, I wasn't a fan. The second reason was because I couldn't stand the last film and feared I was going to watch a sequel being lost from the beginning. I discovered my fears were unfounded as this story starts from the beginning with an updated mildly hip-hop version of the series.Meagan Fox stars as April O'Neill, the froth reporter who has ties to the group. She is aided by her ""nerd"" camera man (Will Arnett) who wants to have ties to her, The Turtles are up against the Shredder, an evil Samurai robot who leads the Foot Clan intent on taking over NYC.This is a fun predictable action popcorn film. It is not on the Avenger level of films (what is?) but one the kids can enjoy without thinking too much.Guide: Cartoon style violence. ""Sh**, Damn, hell"""
" Some what amusing to watch
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,7,"Honestly, I was never really a fan of the turtle until they introduced the 3D demographics in 2012. But this movie was pretty decent and had few funny moments. Like when the turtles get stuck in a hole and Micky farts. 
The CGI in this movie is good the acting is decent but the story could have been improved.
The origin of the turtles is weird unless if it is the real origin because in this film April had the turtles as her pets and her dad gets killed. 
Overall not a bad movie but needs improving."
" Ignore the haters, please.
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,8,"Like the summary says, ignore the haters. This movie was awesome and long overdue. Aside from Megan Fox playing as April (which is why I didn't give it a full 10) I really enjoyed this movie. I don't understand what all the fuss is about. Everyone has their own opinions I guess but don't let all the bad reviews stop you from watching it."
" An average CGI turtles movie.
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,6,"This is another movie retread of the four ninja turtles. This time, they must face Shredder and his evil Foot Clan in New York City to defeat their power over the city's authorities.While the action was pretty intense and fun and the acting was OK, there is really nothing new in plot to the movie that we haven't seen in previous TMNT films. The main difference is the heavy use of CGI and modern-day technology references.I personally prefer the original 1990 TMNT motion picture, which was cheesy at times, but had character, humor, realistic-looking costumes and a more fast-paced and engaging story-line.Grade C+"
" An Honest Review
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,1,"Have you seen it? No? There is likely a very good reason for that...it stinks.Like nearly ALL the endless remakes and reboots that have been plaguing movie goers for the past decade or so....all this is, is a heartless version of the original.It has no heart.It has no soul.It is a retelling of a film that we all love and cherish...and it adds nothing to the story. It improves nothing but the special effects--which held up very well over time--and in some cases belittles the fans of the original...particularly in the fact that they remade the movie at all, without adding anything clever to it.Like so many other remakes it is a hallow shell of the original."
" OK movie but not the worse.
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,2,OK some of the things here were pretty neat with this movie and some were not i liked the fact that is was live action at the time but somethings were missing well the pilot was OK the writing was cheesy it needed work so that's one bad thing the actors were OK compared to other live action movies over the years the jokes weren't funny that's bad thing and the animation is not the best but OK considering it being in cgi so in summary not the worst movie but not the best movie.
" ""Please keep your arms and legs inside the shell at all times.""
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,6,"I never became a Ninja Turtle fan when they made their debut in the mid-Eighties as comic book heroes from Mirage Studios. Like any fad that catches on, they spawned a whole raft of toys, books, costumes, cartoons and movies. I've never seen any of the films until now, and basically as a treat for my eight year old granddaughter. She got the biggest kick out of this flick, but most of my enjoyment came from watching her eat it all up. For me, this wasn't much more than an animated cartoon set to live action, with as much over the top serio-comic action as could be packed into an hour and a half run time. One tip for the film makers - how about introducing your principal characters instead of making us try to figure out who's who. I know Raphael wore the red and Donatello the blue, but Michelangelo and Leonardo were a toss-up for the orange and purple. One interesting concept though as it relates to fine dining - I sure would like to try one of those ninety nine cheese pizzas. Cowabunga!"
