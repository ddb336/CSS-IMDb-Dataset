" Better than most movies of this type
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie. Either you like possession movies or you don't. I do, and this is one of the better movies of this type. I even liked the original Exorcist movie with it's poor makeup and special effects, but this movie is better."
" Enjoyable.
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,8,"Why has this got such a low rating? Mind you I don't trust this rating system at all. Actually most of the reviewers don't even know what they're watching tbh...Anyway it's not just ""another exorcism movie"". And anyway, they're barely released nowadays so how can that even be a relevant comment? It's filmed well, the lead up and how she reacts and the actual possession etc.I really enjoy these movies but unfortunately not a market for them anymore. What were ppl expecting in a possession movie? Lmao that's like saying 'i laughed' when watching a comedy...forget the reviews that are negative. This is a strong movie."
" Good cast, fairly decent movie, perhaps for select audiences only
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,6,"'The Vatican Tapes' is an okay movie. It's nothing extraordinary, but it's not bad, either. It may well be enjoyed by a general audience; alternatively, how much it finds favor with more niche viewers may depend on how discerning they are.This is a story about ill omens culminating in demonic possession and, as even early press releases foretold, attempted exorcism. From those plot points alone this is technically a horror feature, but at least for my part, there are more thrills here than genuine chills. Will fans of horror films, generally, like 'The Vatican Tapes?' Maybe.One of two things that I specifically enjoyed about 'The Vatican Tapes' is that build-up - the increasing sense of suspense, of something not being quite right, as the ill omens and eerie goings-on accumulate. So it is, with me, for just about any horror movie, and this is no different. Any horror film can throw blood, gore, monsters, and death in the viewer's face. Even in an otherwise mediocre feature, it takes a more deft hand to let pieces slowly settle into place, leading to a climax, than to immediately show one's hand.The emphasis in marketing, and the general thrust of the narrative, is the suggestion of exorcism, not unlike other exorcism horror films that find release every few years or so. If that's your cup of tea, great, but to be very honest, it's certainly not mine. It's a relatively rare horror film that I find in any way frightening to begin with, and it's harder still to take them seriously when the premise is constructed around some paranormal whatsit that select folks, in real life, somehow believe are very real things. Media that centers ""ghost-hunting"" is laughable for just that reason, and it's why I readily give exorcism films a pass, too. 'The Exorcist,' as far as I'm concerned, is highly overrated. So that's certainly not the appeal for me here.What is the draw? Well, the other thing that I specifically enjoy about 'The Vatican Tapes' - for me, as is undoubtedly true for others, it's the casting of Olivia Taylor Dudley that pulled me in. Djimon Hounsou and Michael Pena have the star power, but it's Dudley that has the featured role as possession victim Angela. Dudley cut her teeth with Internet sketch comedy group 5secondfilms, and as a fan of those hard-working rascals, I certainly can't turn down an opportunity to see an alumnus in a major feature film.And, truly - I 100% recognize that I'm a bit biased here; if not for Dudley's involvement, there's a significant chance I wouldn't care about this movie at all. Even so, as far as I'm concerned, Dudley's performance is ultimately the reason to watch 'The Vatican Tapes.' She convincingly makes Angela very relatable as she struggles to understand what's happening to her, and very believable as the film takes a turn heading into the very worthy climax. As the narrative resolves the climax and reaches toward its conclusion, Dudley perfectly exudes Angela's calm and cool demeanor, the ending suggesting further thrilling events beyond the roll of the credits here.Numerical ratings are less important in reviewing a movie than the words behind them, but even at that, I'm a little torn on how to summarize my feelings. I like the building tension, and love Olivia Taylor Dudley's performance (and I'm happy to see that at least some published critics agree with me on that count). I enjoy the ending. Yet I recognize my bias, and recognize that outside of these specific aspects of the movie that I enjoy, the film can be a bit middling, without much for audiences to necessarily be excited about.It's not revelatory, yet I like 'The Vatican Tapes.' Whether or not you will, too, probably depends on how much you like to engage with its constituent parts. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show - just don't expect an end-all-be-all picture."
" Antichrist
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,10,It was an terrifying movie . Am just scared of it. But it say something about Antichrist to this world .....💀😨
" Really quite good
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,8,"I was surprised at how good this movie turned out. Basically the devil obtains messianic power on earth as a woman rather than a man. The acting is good by everyone. Dougray Scott is superb as an American! Pena though is somewhat miscast I think. Yes, it's a typical exorcist movie but well worth a watch. Not as good as The Exorcist but not far off."
" Slightly worse than average
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,4,"Very basic kinda scary movie, was about a 5 until the end, as it was terrible. The acting was okay and the very few scary parts were decent. I honestly feel like im being a little generous with this 4 star. I don't recommend this unless you've already seen the majority of horror movies on netflix. It really isn't that scary and is a tad worse than your generic demon movie. Overall worth a watch but only if it's bedtime if you're binging random horror movies, not the worst but sure as hell not the best."
" Would bore even the evil one...
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,2,"Oh my. Where to start? I was looking for a different type of movie, and this caught my eye. I thought maybe it would have a different slant, or give a peek as to how a real exorcism is performed. The promo implies a heroic fight of good vs evil, so I thought I'd check it out.What's truly scary about this movie is that it was allowed to be released, and that they paid people real money to act in it.A young woman becomes possessed through...writing an article on the anti-Christ? Seriously? We know ""the drill""...attractive young person becomes possessed, it gets progressively worse, someone has the bright idea that it's probably a demonic possession, and let's get a priest over here pronto. About halfway through, I was wondering, when is the big fight of good vs evil going to happen?There were some startling scenes, but you were forewarned by the crescendo in the music, a raven showing up, and the actress having a contemptuous look on her face. Predictable.And, what's with all the focus on cameras? Maybe a subtext commentary? Who knows?Finally, the exorcism is planned and carried out. They didn't even get that right. First of all, real exorcisms take place in a sacred place, like a church or a chapel. Second, the priest will wear a purple stole, which is worn during hearing Confession and during an exorcism. It symbolizes his authority from the bishop, and representing Christ. It's also a symbol of healing and penance. The priest had no stole, and did a few other things that wouldn't necessarily happen during an exorcism.I was expecting the battle for Good vs Evil to happen after the ""big reveal""....but...then what?! All of a sudden, the credits start rolling. For TEN minutes. That means that the movie is only 1 hour, twenty minutes.The acting is ho-hum; the characters don't really have much depth to them, or reason for being there. This movie is really not worth your time, except maybe from a clinical standpoint.. Don't say I didn't warn you."
" Reveal Yourself DEMON!!!!!
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,5,"We begin with a brief synopsis of what the CHURCH fears. About Possession.And then we meet Angela. Angela is dating Pete. Angela has a military father who doesn't seem to take much crap.Angela cuts her finger cutting her own birthday cake. Angela gets stitches.

" Why all this hate
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,6,"Sure it was tongue in cheek had plot issues and a big step out of reality but none the less fun, not your last excorsim level of production but the protagonist did her best, one could tell she put her soul into the devil to get it right which was also hilarious cause you could tell she was acting her butt off, unfortunately for her the partner was a right tool and the things that happened in this movie is best forgotten so I gave it a solid 6 trust me ive seen much much worse with great ratings maybe my taste is different either way don't fall for bad ratings and lose out on a devil of a good time 😀 😉 👍 😜 😄 😁 😀"
" I'm a black or white type guy, either 1 or 10
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,10,"I love possession movies because that's really the only thing that scares me, I enjoyed it and had a cool ending! Plus I relate these movies to the real world, I feel earth is the devils playground, the ending made sense to me!"
" Nothing makes sense in this movie!
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,2,"While I won't go as far as to say this is one of the worst movies I've seen in recent years, it's certainly one of the stupidest. Frankly, this movie feels like it would serve better at a haunted house attraction where story isn't one of their top priorities. Not only is the premise forgettable, but the story itself is littered with plot holes, unanswered questions, corny dialogue, and hollow characters. Nothing is ever explained in this movie, and the creators know this. They don't even try to make an excuse for some of the events that happen. A lot of the conflict feels forced, so much so that I had to re-watch some parts to see if I missed anything because I thought I wasn't paying attention, but I was and they just left some parts out. There were a lot of obvious set-ups for cheap jump-scares. The pacing in this movie is non-existent, since it keeps bouncing from timeline to timeline. If you want to do that, at least be organized about it (a good example I would use is the first season of 'How to Get Away With Murder'). Not only does the movie lack in story, but it lacks in style. The camerawork is so shaky, it looks like parts were filmed during an earthquake. The coloring looks cheap (although, the majority of the movie looks cheap). Honestly, the best technical aspects were the CGI. It's not great by any means, but at least the people in that department were trying, and for a production where no one is trying other than some of the actors, I'll take what I can get. And if I'm cherishing that, then you know this movie is not worth watching. Even with the few good scenes in this film (I thought the actual exorcism was the best scene), there's not much going for it and you'd be praying on a miracle to find anything outstanding in this."
" i love it!!
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,10,"I am a horror fan. This had me shaking in my boots, it was all there. i felt it. Don't mind the ratings and watch it for yourself."
" Okay for the first half... then like, what?!
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,4,"The lead up to the exorcism isn't too bad, typical low budget scary movie vibes and all. But then all hell breaks loose (literally, I guess) and the ending is left unresolved and almost laughable."
" Horrible.
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,2,"One minute she's intubated and then she's just sleeping with no tube and then seconds later they are extubating her. Details? Not even a details, this is a major issue. And they have hospital alarms, but an unattended baby?? This is stupid. ""Code trauma, Call a code trauma!"" ""The doctor that stitched your finger gave you an antibiotic, probably because he feared a lawsuit."" (That must be why she's crazy, two months later) Good lord, that's normal practice. Don't you know nurses or have a consulting medical person? Who wrote this? They didn't even get the ""Lord's Prayer"" right. I'm a fan of some of the actors but this was a stinker."
" Wow
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,1,The acting...is so so so bad. It all happened way too fast. There was no buildup or storyline. But the worst part for me is definitely the horrendous acting especially the main character. She has no skill whatsoever.
" Utterly forgettable
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,2,"I forgot which ""sweet girl turns possessed creepy killer"" movie I was watching midway through and could never really figure it out. Honestly looking back on it now, even though I just watched it, it blends together in my mind with 10 or more other movies with the exact same premise. Nothing new, nothing special, completely forgettable."
" A solid entertaining film.
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,7,"I'm sure most horror fans with an interest in religion/exorcism based films will find something to enjoy here.Sure it's nothing new, but it's well acted and stylishly executed in terms of cinematography.There's not really any wasted time on screen, and it rattles along at a good pace.So many horror films these days have a cheap feel, this doesn't. It's not a classic like The Exorcist, or The Omen, but it's a heck of a lot better than most being made nowadays."
" Waste of human and material resources
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,3,"Nice argument, great artists but terrible direction.
Movie could have been better"
" BOORING
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,2,All that happens in the first third of this movie is we watch this girl going in and out of comas and having hallucinations. Don't bother...
" One of the best horror movies i've seen in the last years
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,8,"Yes same story again, a girl possesed by the evil gods etc, but its a well made movie with a nice script and it really is a horror movie. it gave me some chills and i dont remember many post-millenial horror movies to do that to me. recommended for sure!"
" Very weak
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,4,"Very weak despite having good actors, but they were very poorly used. The somewhat slow action fails to create tension, causing the film to drag."
" Not too too bad
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,5,"First thing first. During opening scenes when Roger was when in military uniform, it was impossible for me not to notice the following.Unit citations on right breast were out of order.
Name tag was above citations, not on pocket flap.
On his left pocket, his wings and his marksmanship badge should be in reverse order.
He wears an army good conduct ribbon, but he also wears commissioned officer rank. The good conduct metal is only awarded to enlisted ranks. Perhaps he was enlisted prior to being commissioned, but it also had device attached indicating it was awarded multiple times, yet he wears no nco development ribbon. Uncommon for a man that has been in long enough to receive multi good conduct metals.
Also not wearing an army service ribbon. Impossible if he is wearing a good conduct.
He needs a shave. Definitely unsatisfactory if in uniform.
Sorry folks, i was in far too long not to pick that up, as im sure other vets did.
In these times with the internet, would be simple to get that stuff right. Disappointed.
Movie dragged a bit during exorcism scenes, and an abrupt ending that can only be fixed by watching a sequel.
Over all not too too bad but was hoping for so much better."
" Actually Very Good
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,8,"Bemused by low scores for The Vatican Tapes, for me it was very good. It's a slow build-up, an original(ish) story - unlike some by-the-numbers possession-related flicks, and not ""predictable"". Worth an hour and a half of your time..."
" Better than I expected!
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Reading the reviews on here I saw some negative ones so I was hesitant to watch this move, but I gotta say I'm not disappointed. It really is better than I expected. It isn't the absolute best horror or exorcism movie in the world, but I still really enjoyed it and would watch it again. I'm glad I decided to ignore those negative reviews and give it a shot."
" Great original exorcist horror that ratchets up by degrees
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,9,"I've noticed in new horror coming out these days that there is a tendency to tell/suggest to the audience early on that the evil they face is way more powerful than mortals and no one has a chance. Somehow, we find the idea intriguing, and we want to keep watching to see if there is the slimmest chance the hero will triumph. It's clever film writing, as we are all hot-wired to assume there is a hope in hell, as we've been watching only a hope in hell movies, especially super-hero, big budget animation and blockbuster action, for decades now. We therefore don't react logically. Logically we'd all switch off and watch something else, as we know everyone is going to die. This power overload technique, always established early, I've now seen in several movies, including Grave Halloween (2013), and The Possession of Hannah Grace (2018), Slender Man (2018), and The Bye Bye Man (2017). Similar movies such as Truth or Dare (2018) or The Midnight Man (2016) also establish a huge evil power base, but at least give 'contestants' a fighting chance. The Vatican Tapes also establishes a massive evil power ability early on. Can it be fought? That's the crux and the delight of this movie. I really liked the way the filmmakers portrayed the evil as 'getting closer' by some very creepy fieldwork involving corridors and such. The sound was good, also creepy. I liked the way the evil seemed to be setting everything up, first by forcing a lifestyle that was headed outdoors to happiness to one that was headed very indoors to possible despair (or worse), and thus to that darkest of indoors, the institution. The Vatican Tapes is a fantastic, and original, expansion of the possession theme, a modern and current take, with fantastic actors at the top of their games. Top shelf horror.I docked it a point for the unnecessary shaky-cameras-from-several-angles-and sources-capture-footage that began the piece and went on for the first 20 minutes or so. I get the writers wanted to tie a realism back to the Vatican investigation, but there are more traditional ways to do that and this film didn't need the found footage stamp at all. Mind you, once you get through that it gets better by leaps and bounds and ends up a truly satisfying horror ride, quite deliciously prophetic too."
" A televangelists tale
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,5,"I was entertained for an hour and a half, and had my expectations subverted - in a positive way (not in a Rian Johnson way, thankfully). It is well shot, using good effects, it has a reasonable script, with on par performances all round."
" Absolutely horrendous 2 Is generous
",2019-12-06 00:00:00,2,"That was crap there's no other way to put it, the ending was one of the worst endings I've ever seen. The story was crap and the acting was worse. Michael Pena is the only reason why this didn't get a one incredible actor."
" The Vatican Tapes
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,4,"How many films were on exorcism? Ten? One hundred? One thousand? I think no less than a hundred for sure.
And this topic is no longer battered? Yes, if only!
Well, they would come up with something interesting, the behavior of the one who is possessed by the devil is always the same, he turns around, yells, throws things, tries to strangle someone.
And when I watched this movie, I didn't even know what to do. Screaming in fear or choking with laughter. So this movie is ridiculous.
The genre of horror is very delicate and making a good movie is good luck.
In this case, a miracle did not happen and the film, like hundreds of others on this subject, came out just as an absurd horror movie with more or less good actors. This can be noted as the only plus.
Kathleen Robertson looked very harmonious for example. Yes, I liked Michael Pena.
I do not recommend spending your 1.5 hours anyway."
" Misquoting the Bible
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,4,"In the credits this movie claims Revelation 19:20 says: this is the spirit of the antichrist which you heard was coming and now is in th world already.WRONG WRONG WRONGThis passage actually says: And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.Perhaps the former passage is from the catholic bible."
" Lacking Leadership
",2019-08-02 00:00:00,5,"Interesting enough story with grand ideas, but seemed to lack a strong enough director to bring those ideas to their full potential. Even with a lower budget and the visual shortcomings that come with it, it felt as if a high school film student was directing this film due to the poor production decisions that dominated throughout. Not a bad way to spend 90 minutes, but a disappointing example of wasted potential."
" An acceptable watchable exorcism thriller but with some failures , gaps and flaws
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,6,"THE VATICAN TAPES is a creepy and horror film about exorcism, professionally , though flawed , directed by Mark Neveldine . For 2,000 years the Vatican has recorded evidence of evil . May God have mercy on their souls. Truly terrifiyng story following the ultimate battle between good and evil - God versus Satan . Angela Holmes (Olivia Taylor) is an ordinary 27-year-old who lives with her boyfriend (John Patrick) . At the beginning Angela has an argument with her overprotective daddy (Dougray Scott) , shortly after she has a convulsion and her father and fiancé carry her to the hospital until she begins to have a devastating effect on anyone close, causing serious injury and death. Holmes is subsequently examined and possession is suspected, but when the Vatican is called upon to exorcise the demon, the possession proves to be an ancient satanic force more powerful than ever imagined . Later on, she is under psychiatric care under Dr. Richards (Kathleen Robertson) , suffering from the effects of being possessed by the devil . It's all up to Father Lozano (Michael Peña) to wage war for more than just Angela's soul, but for the world as we know it . She getting sicker by the time, being really possessed, as a demon into a young woman gone amok . Family relies on priests who start to visit her every day . There is something dark and sinister inside Angela , a nasty demon that goes bersek and she wants to eject it. Then , Cardinal Mattias Bruun (Peter Andersson) investigates the sinister happenings , as he attempts to help the possessed lass and he submits Angela a weird exorcism . There are some things best kept in secret.Horror picture shot in fits and starts with incoherent plot, dealing with a ghastly possession , as a young woman is possessed by a malevolent and heinous spirit causing creepy, scary and terrible moments ; then , a priest and two Vatican exorcists must do battle with an ancient satanic force to save the soul of the strange girl . A rare film about exorcism in similar style to The Exorcist 1973 by William Friedkin . This latter movie remains still startling and engrossing with every viewing, it spread countless sequels and imitations, one of them is this one, though , of course, it is far cry from the original Exorcist . Genuinely scary moments overcome some obvious plot devices. This is a juicy terrifying material fashioning an iconic diabolic possession, providing screams, thrills, shocks and chilling scenes .It has an extremely known premise spawns the film in ups and downs. All semblance of plausibility is extracted, leaving a main cast of little known actors : Olivia Taylor and John Patrick , to show their limited skills. However, the support cast is pretty good , such as : Dougray Scott , Michael Peña , Peter Andersson Djimon Hounsou , Kathleen Robertson , Michael Halsey .There appears briefly Michael Paré , Daniel Bernhardt and Alison Lohman who married director Mark Neveldine playing a Psych patient , but she has less than 2o seconds of screen time.It delivers a scary and eerie ambient thanks to an expert cameraman, Gerardo Madrazo . As well as a frightening, suspenseful and chilling musical score byJoseph Bishara . Being efficiently produced by Chris Morgan , Eric Reid and Richard Wright . This silly, non-sense , late night horror picture was decently directed by Mark Neveldine , though with no originality and it has some flaws and gaps. Mark Neveldine has directed a few acceptable films such as : ¨Crank¨, its sequel : ¨Crank high voltage¨, ¨Ghost Rider : Spirit of Vengeance¨and in pre-production ¨Finding Jack¨ . Rating 6/10 . Passable and decent exorcism/horror movie . No for squamish"
" Typical sensationalist drama
",2019-04-04 00:00:00,2,"The thing that annoys me about these kind of portrayals is that they don't tell a true story.Satan always appears to have at least a commensurate amount of power and influence as God. In fact he is just a creature, far less powerful than his creator.These stories also give the impression that those with faith in evil are equally powerful as those with faith in God. Thing is... it's not the amount of faith you have, but who your faith is in.So apart from providing a populist fantasy story, it fails abysmally in giving a balanced view of Satan's pathetic attempts at de-God-ing God."
" Pretty good filmmaking actually.
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,7,A Catholic exorcism that wasn't terrible with good talent & special effects.
" I've Seen Worse
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,6,"One of the worst things about being a horror buff is having already seen things done the same way over and over again. You are constantly trying to find something fresh but a lot of times you simply see the same thing with only the places and people changing. You become jaded and harsh to the newer films. I think that is some of what is happening with this film. I gonna review it not based on or in competition with others.This film isn't as bad as some have made it out to be. I felt that it carried a steady creepiness throughout and the actors were decent. The story was well scripted and it could've been setting itself up for a sequel. I didn't care for the pace. It seemed to drag at times. I thought the stunts weren't the best but they were ok. I didn't consider them or the CGI as being cheesy or too cheaply done.All-in-all, this isn't one of the best but it is a far cry from one of the worst."
" The best thing
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,7,The best thing in this film is the lovely Olivia Taylor Dudley. It's certainly a different version of an exorcist film with a surprising finale. It's not a memorable film but nevertheless has memorable moments.
" Solid and worthwhile exorcism effort
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,8,"Concerned with the world at large, a priest and a cardinal from the Vatican investigate the series of strange phenomenon surrounding a young woman in America who's at the center of a series of strange accidents only to discover something dangerous is inside her that will destroy mankind.This was a decent enough genre effort. One of the better features here is the fact that this one really works the low-key nature of the possession rather nicely in how it builds up her eventual situation. With the first half slowly building up her case about being possessed, running this in conjunction with the idea of trying to sell her new boyfriend to her father, the incidents at the birthday party or the bird attack on the bus-ride they take together gives this some rather fine starting points which gets extrapolated later on in several rather impressive sequences. The chilling scenes of her awakening from the coma inside the hospital and then later attacking the officers through supernatural influence when they appear to question her makes for quite an enjoyable time here as this one really goes out to offer the idea that she's become possessed by something as the fact that all this evidence is mounting together, alongside the visual changes to her body as well as the more traditional scenes of the possession as the speaking in tongues or knowing secrets she possibly couldn't. Even the extraordinary fun of the rampage at the asylum where she forces the inmates into a frenzy attacking each other and the staff through suggestion and creates such a disruption to their training that it sets up the great finale. Once it focuses on the idea of the possession and battling the demon inside, the exorcism sequence here is quite fun with the majority of the focus on trying to vanquish the evil which isn't new at all but certainly manages to maintain quite a fevered tone by the time it pulls out the fine twist at the end which fully reveals the fate in store for this one which is an incredibly chilling and powerful twist that works rather nicely. Together these manage to hold this one up over it's few minor flaws. The main issue with this one is the utterly unbelievable amount of setup needed to finally convince people of what's going on, with the entire first hour seemingly devoted to telling the idea of her being possessed through events that really should've been investigated a little further. The scenes at the hospital should've been more than enough to sell somebody on her situation, yet this one has to wait until the various rounds of interviews conducted at the asylum and then seeing the chaos caused which is so deep into the film after these other events that it seems ludicrous they'd wait this long and makes the exorcism come out of nowhere with little build-up. As well, the finale runs a little too long and really didn't need to be there, causing this one to come up with a brief exorcism attempt and then running way too long on the final reveal that doesn't really need to be there. These here really manage to hold it back.Rated PG-13: Violence and Language."
" Probably What You're Expecting
",2018-09-07 00:00:00,4,"While the vatican tapes isn't terrible, it's biggest downfall is honestly that it just doesn't do anything new. If you are a frequent watcher of horror you'll probably be able to plot out the movie pretty well; it's nothing extraordinary but still a good pick if you're in the mood for a supernatural flick that you don't have to think too much about. The biggest problems, I would say, are that the style and filming are fairly sloppy and disjointed for the beginning half of the movie, the pacing is really rough throughout the film, and much of the plot and character decisions are lacking motivation or purpose. The bright side is that the acting is not terrible, in fact Olivia Taylor Dudley is a stand out in this giving a pretty believable and powerful performance throughout the film. Overall it just doesn't just do much for me, it was pretty predictable and sloppy in parts, and though the premise (showcased in the last quarter of the film) and the ending is interesting it's done in a way that doesn't outweigh the good parts for the bad. Not terrible but I probably won't watch this again."
" Should of been way better!
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,3,"I thought that using the ""Vatican"" name in the title of the film would of been seeing how good over comes evil, especially with the twist of the plot, but this film was bad. The acting was mediocre, to much happy feeling from the cast, but Micheal Pena was not that strong in this film compare to his other work. The story gets you into the film, but not much in depth in how the church prepares to do battle with the anti-christ, where other exorcist like ""The Priest(korean)"" shows how the demon became and it's methods of defiance. There's hardly no bloody gore, it's not the type that has you closing your eyes so you will not see the ""horror""parts. Very bad film for its genre!"
" Nice ending seq but in general just a little overaverage
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,6,"The ending of this movie is sth new and quite interesting and uncommon in that sort of horror movies but generally the movie is just overaverage. I can recommend it to watch there is nothing more interesting in the last years to offer to a spectator.
They should stop making all that Exorcist-like stuff or make sth truly new to distinguish itself from the rest."
" plodding slow boil
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,5,"The Vatican has maintained tapes of possible satanic possessions over the years. Vicar Imani (Djimon Hounsou) shows Cardinal Bruun (Peter Andersson) the case of Angela Holmes (Olivia Taylor Dudley). Two months earlier, her boyfriend Pete Smith (John Patrick Amedori) throws her a surprise birthday party with her father (Dougray Scott) attending. She cuts herself with the cake knife and reluctantly goes to the hospital. Strange things start to happen including her unquenchable thirst. She is hospitalized. There's an incident and the police is called in but Father Lozano (Michael Peña) sees the supernatural. Angela is put into a group home under the supervision of psychiatrist Dr. Richards (Kathleen Robertson).It's a horror without scares. It's plodding. It has no style and no pace. It has worthwhile actors but not all of them stick around. It should have Father Lozano as the protagonist since he's the most natural point of view. Angela could work if it goes more into the demon world. The story is flat and unoriginal. It's on the slow boil and stays there. It's security camera footage and slow moving plot. There is some attempt at atmosphere. The exorcism doesn't have pea soup but it does have CGI fire. This was released theatrically but it's more fitting as one of the countless VOD offerings."
" The Devil can chose anyone
",2017-10-20 00:00:00,8,"The film opens as if it going to be a documentary on the various exorcism tapes collected by the Vatican, but in the first few minutes Cardinal Bruun (Peter Andersson) knows this is going to be an anti-Christ/exorcism film from watching Angela (Olivia Taylor Dudley) move her lips, perhaps giving away too much too soon. And we know how these things end. The anti-Christ either dies or it don't.Yes, we can all say ""been there done that"" and was done better. I particular liked how they did the first hour of the film and Olivia Taylor Dudley did a convincing job.Guide: No F-bombs. No sex or nudity. Some sex talk."
" what the ???
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,1,"the Antichrist is a woman ?? okay thats maybe fine but how did he came inside her by a knife ??? in here 25 birthday ?? or by the bird , and where is the chair in the movie it just disappeared that was weid and why the bird can contact who is the bird and why the father didn't die what happened to him this is not cool"
" Disappointing
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,3,"I was looking forward to watching this film, it seemed like it had so much potential, but I was very disappointed. I found the characters jarred against one another and the most believable was probably the raven. I feel that the bulk of what the film was really about all slumped to the latter end of the film, which made it seem rushed and inconsistent. What a shame."
" Not a possession movie
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,7,"I don't quite understand how this movie got such a low rating. It is a decent end-of-time movie, not a possession film. While I was watching, I was thinking that it should have a 5 to 6 IMDb star rating, but I thought maybe the ending would ruin the film just like so many other horror movies. The ending is quite good. Normally, I don't like endings that do not finish the story. So many horror films leave business unfinished so there will be an opportunity for sequels. This film could have a sequel but does not require one. The story is about the beginning of the end. If there were to be a sequel, it would have to be epic, a very different sort of film. Try ""Lord of the Rings"" epic. If not, then it should not be made at all.As I said before, it is not a possession movie. There may be an attempt to exorcise a demon, but if one pays attention, it is very clear why the exorcism does not work. Exorcism aims to remove a demon from the human host. It does not work if there is no demon to remove.There are many things that could be explained better, such as when the cardinal realizes he was not dealing with a run of the mill demon and when he realizes his attempt to get rid of it only serves to promote its progress. The parody of Christ's birth, death and resurrection is too subtle and needed to be more developed. We saw the cardinal's face. We know he realizes something, but most of us who are watching won't know what and won't know why he change his tactics, which turned out to be another mistake and confirmed what he already suspected, that there was no possession to be exorcised. This is not a movie about the final battle between good and evil. It's about the fight before the ultimate battle, a fight that the forces of good lose."
" One will come to mimic the Christ...
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,2,"I went into this movie feeling pretty skeptical, and sadly those doubts were completely justified (not that I expected much from a director otherwise known for Jason Statham action flicks). It feels like there have been a million possession movies over the years and, honestly, it's rare that I find one that I really love, and that isn't just a cookie cutter version of the same story (which, in itself, IS interesting and scary as hell, it's just rarely portrayed in a way that I find to be genuinely chilling).As if I really need to tell the plot, but Angela (Olivia Taylor Dudley) visits the hospital for a cut finger and, later on, for a related infection. On the way home she violently takes the wheel and crashes the car, winding up in a coma for 40 days (see what they did there?). Right as they are about to pull her off life support she wakes up, seemingly none the worse for wear. Her father (Dougray Scott) and boyfriend Pete (John Patrick Amedori) — who partake in some of the most predictable banter and relationship clashing ever — are very concerned as she starts to exhibit signs of demonic possession and is subsequently admitted to a psychiatric facility, where things just get crazier until the inevitable exorcism when her true form is revealed.It's just meh. The acting isn't bad, by any means, but it's nothing special, with Dudley being the standout but not by much. The scene where she ""forces"" the detective to smash the lightbulbs into his eyes is admittedly pretty awesome, but it's fleeting (not that I want to see more footage of eyeball-lightbulb-smashing, just saying it's a small glimmer of hope in an otherwise mediocre pool of movie). They use every trick in the book — Angela speaking in Aramaic, furniture moving on its own, the sudden bursts of violence by the other patients. The scene with her spitting up the eggs — apparently representing a perverted Holy Trinity — was pretty neat, as was Angela pulling on her chains so hard that she breaks her own back and arms.But they really missed the mark on most of it — they barely showed Vicar Imani (Djimon Hounsou) or Cardinal Bruun (Peter Andersson), who you would THINK would be more central characters given the name. I was hoping for a bit more backstory but instead they relied a bit too much on tired stereotypes, a fairly bland script, and unimpressive effects. Womp!"
