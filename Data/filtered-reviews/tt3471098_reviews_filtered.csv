" Weird film about weird people...
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,7,"...but it works. In fact, it's the weirdness that makes the film somewhat endearing.I have to say right off that there isn't a single actor in this film that I actually like. I can tolerate Ethan Hawke, depedning on the film...and there have been a couple of his films I have really liked...and others that I totally disliked. But he fits here, and he does it well. Somehow I have never caught one of Greta Gerwig's films, and I guess I'll have to see more to determine how I feel about her as an actress. I've never cared for Julianne Moore. Bill Hader's role here is rather bland, as is Maya Rudolph's. Yet together they work, which I guess makes this more a ensemble cast than a starring and supporting cast.All three of the main characters -- Hawke, Gerwig, and Moore -- are dysfunctional people, to one degree or another. In fact, it's their dysfunction that brings them together. And perhaps there's a lesson to learn from that -- that even dysfunctional people, given the right circumstances, can have a somewhat fulfilling life.I was disappointed in the ending of the film. I thought that the three of them were going to live together in an odd relationship, until briefly, at the very end of the film, the equally weird character Travis Fimmel -- who doesn't appear to own a pair of pants -- reappears. And I don't like movie endings that remain up in the air.This film is not going to have you on the edge of your seat. It rambles around a bit, but I found it generally satisfying. I won't want to watch it again...but it's good for a one-timer."
" The only thing redeeming about this film is...
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,2,The little girl Lily.Pretentious twaddle. Trying to hard to be a Woody Allen flick and failing miserably.Julian Moore is surprisingly terrible in this film.Ethan Hawke is pretty typical.Plot line was good but the execution was terrible.
" Nothing special
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,4,"Not bad movie and not good, you will feel bored in half of it."
" Go Greta Go!
",2019-09-19 00:00:00,8,"Very good at showing what at first seems right ends up being so wrong and what at first is overlooked deserves a second look. Story of my life if I may say so myself. Crossing Delancey with Amy Irving just had to be an inspiration for this movie. I mean, they both had overlooked pickle guys in them for goodness sake!"
" Ethan Hawke AND Greta Gerwig? SOLD
",2019-05-29 00:00:00,8,So good! Weird and quirky and I actually can't wait to see these two fabulous actors in the same movie again. Great watch!
" Very good movie; too much me, me, me
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,7,"This is a very well-written, well-acted movie. It's a love triangle with a curious but clever twist that starts about midway through the movie. The three lead actors do a great job, and the child actors are also very good, especially the actress who plays the oldest of the three. I found all the premises of the movie quite believable.I only write this review because I think I might have watched my last movie with Greta Gerwig in it. Why? Because to me she symbolizes the me, me, me, narcissistic millennial generation. Every time she speaks a line, I feel me, me, me. Both her and especially Ethan Hawke's characters in the movie are constantly trying to find themselves, constantly talking about how they feel about things, what they think about things (nothing wrong with this if it isn't so self-absorbed, of course), but it comes off to me as quite narcissistic. I felt as if these two and several other characters, while involved in their jobs, their children, etc., just couldn't wait to find a time and place to express me, me, me. So while I thought this was a good movie, I came away from it with a bad taste in my mouth."
" Woody Allen style rip off.
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,4,"""Maggie's Plan"" Well.....her plan was boring. Other than Greta character this dull drag of a movie boasted some unlikeable characters and a boring plot. Homewrecker frump Greta steals the husband (Ethan Hawke) of Julianne Moore (what the hell was that stupid accent?) then decides she made a mistake and helps Julianne win him back. Thats about it. Greta dressed like a bag lady throughout. Julianne sounded like a Russian madame and Ethan Hawke collected a paycheck. It put me to sleep."
" story takes a turn
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,9,This is one of the view romcom movies that is actually surprising. I would recommend this movie on a rainy day. It is a feel good movie in a not cliche way.
" Weird movie
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,5,"First of all, the very first scene in the movie basically starts with Maggie saying she wants a baby. No scene-setting or anything, it felt like the director just couldn't be bothered to somehow introduce the story. Then there's weird time warps in the middle of it, where we cut to her with a 3 year old kid who came out of nowhere, and the audience is supposed to guess who it is and who she had it with. Then the actual plot of the movie feels like she's somehow degressing and unravelling her life for no obvious reason. Why didn't she just dump the guy? It was just kind of pointless. And all the while the two female leads just forgive a man who brings nothing to the table, is unfaithful and a waste of space, but is somehow worthy of his family back and everyone going out of their way not to just break up with him and leave him to face his own actions. The whole movie was just so bleh."
" masterfully planned
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,10,"It is magnificent . I didn't have much hope with it as the lead is not much on my radar but it had Ethan Hawke ( not in leading role , however ) in it so I decided to watch it . it was amazing . beautiful performances on a realistic story . it ain't shiny so you have to be patient for the story to unfold . nice drama . again , not a blockbuster ."
" Easy-going rom-com
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,6,"'Maggie's Plan' is a fairly simple romantic-comedy - quite light and breezy, with a few laughs and nothing too dramatic to bog it down. Maggie (Gerwig) works at a New York university and her ""plan"" is to have a child by herself, since she's ready to be a mother (she's only meant to be 29, mind) and ""borrows"" some sperm off an old friend. The ""plan"" goes astray when she meets John (Hawke), a professor/anthropologist who's trying to write a novel, and falls in love with him.This is obviously further complicated by the fact John's married to Georgette (Moore), another professor - but she's Danish - and Maggie unwittingly becomes a homewrecker. She technically ends up with three kids - hers and John's, plus her two step-kids John & Georgette already had. Tony (Hader) and Felicia (Rudolph) play her long-married friends and have most of the laugh-out-loud moments. After a few years, Maggie's sick of John and her new ""plan"" is to get him back together with Georgette, which Tony accidentally gives away.The film's not as madcap as it may sound, and Gerwig plays Maggie as innocent and charming. It's real fun watching Hawke & Moore out of their comfort zone - Hawke as the bumbling/ignorant guy who has no idea what's going on in his life and Moore as a straight-and-narrow foreigner, but her accent is hilarious and her character a little deeper than it first appears. The film probably needed a bit more of Hader & Rudolph, but it's all quite sweet and nice, including the ending."
" Decisions
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,6,"The actors are really good in this. And you really feel for them, even when they go through stuff, where you might go ""so what?""! But it can still feel like a drag for some, which is why the viewers are split on this one. I did enjoy personally to a degree, but it's still not as good as some other indie movies are.What may be surprising to some, is the casual nudity that is being displayed. On the other hand I heard Americans are not as frigid anymore as they used to be ... generally speaking, not when it comes to the rating board of course. But this is more than just a shell, it's about how to grow up, when to grow up and what to make of ones life ... Which boils down to decisions ..."
" It will be great for the one who likes it
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,3,"I like to watch independent movies, but I also like to watch movies that I like. If you like Woody Allen you will love this movie.I've looked at the clock so many times that I do not remember how many.I do not know what the movie wants to tell me. I do not know if they themselves know they want to tell. I do not know if they clarify in their lives in any sense.It's such a cold movie that I've thought many times that the movie happens to the boy in the cart, is he ever going to walk? I like Julianne Moore, I always like and this time is no less. Everyone else too. I was surprised to see Travis Fimmel, his crazy look is incredible.It has a white photograph like video camera. I do not know why they always think it only takes one script, the other parts are important.Ugly and simple plans, slow direction, do not know that bored.I know that Allen is a movie god, but I do not like him"
" Nice offbeat romantic comedy, with a great cast
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,8,"I liked this offbeat romantic comedy, which has smart dialog, a strong cast, and an indie feel. Ethan Hawke is an outstanding actor, and his performance in this movie is no exception. I loved the scene where he explodes after having found out about something his wife has done (I'm being deliberately vague here). Greta Gerwig plays her part with just the right touches of awkwardness, honesty, naivet√©, and intelligence, and despite her scheming, her character is quite lovable. The scene where she's with her baby blowing bubbles in the bathtub is quite sweet, among many others. There are bits of wry comedy from Bill Hader and Maya Rudolph, and I found Julianna Moore's character and her accent amusing from beginning to end, but it's all pretty subtle. You may see the ending coming, but the parts in the middle may keep you off balance, and the pace of the movie is good."
" flighty anti-rom-com
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,6,"New Yorker Maggie Hardin (Greta Gerwig) wants to have a baby. Her relationships never last more than six months except her college romance with best friend Tony (Bill Hader) but that doesn't count. She decides to get sperm from college acquaintance, pickle entrepreneur Guy Childers. She works at an art school with Tony's wife Felicia (Maya Rudolph) and John Harding (Ethan Hawke). Maggie and John meet over a paycheck mixup and start a relationship over a novel he's trying to write. He's unhappily married to Columbia professor Georgette (Julianne Moore) with two kids.The appeal of this movie depends a lot on one's appreciation of Gerwig's flighty, quirky persona. It's a rom-com where the romance is not the most likable. Harding starts off poorly and I never find him a good match for Maggie. Even the pickle guy is better although Tony could be the best if there is no Felicia. I'm actually glad at the turn in the second half of the movie and it becomes an anti-rom-com. The funniest relationship is between Maggie and Georgette. The movie could do with more of them together."
" I expected funnier! 3/10
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,3,"Review: Although I knew this was going to be a chick flick, I was expecting it be witty, especially after seeing Bill Hader and Maya Rudolph in the cast but I did get a bit bored with the plot, because it seemed to be going round in circles. The movie is mainly about Maggie (Greta Gerwig), who has a terrible track record of relationships, and really wants to have a baby. After failing to go down the surrogate route, she finally falls for John Harding (Ethan Hawke), who is married to Georgette (Julianne Moore), with 3 kids. When John eventually leaves Georgette for Maggie, they have a little girl together but while he is struggling with his novel, Maggie starts to sense cracks in there relationship. She tries her best to make there relationship work but she becomes a glorified babysitter for all of the kids, which puts a strain on her career. She also can tell that John is unhappy with there marriage, so she puts together a plan to make John fall back in love with Georgette, as she feels guilty for taking him from his ex-wife. Strange but true! Julianne Moore and Ethan Hawke put in there usually top performance and Greta Gerwig was perfect for the leading role but there wasn't enough material to make the movie interesting. There was a few touching moments, like when Maggie was having a bath with her young girl but I still struggled to stay awake through the whole movie. Anyway, although the outcome was pretty predictable, it's still an average watch with some decent performances. Average!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Rebecca Miller, 54, who also brought you Angela in 1995, Personal Velocity: Three Portraits, The Ballad of Jack and Rose, and the Private Lives of Pippa Lee starring Robin Wright and Winona Ryder. She did put together quite a decent cast for this project, so I can honestly can say that the fault wasn't with the performances. I mainly had a problem with the script, which lacked originality and decent humour. I have seen worse in this genre but I still got bored after a while.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $4.9millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedy/romance/dramas, starring Greta Gerwig, Ethan Hawke, Julianne Moore, Bill Hader, Maya Rudolph and Wallace Shawn. 3/10"
