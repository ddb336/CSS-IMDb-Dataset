" This is Art house
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,8,"Artistic, adventurous, but also devastating. This a psychedelic journey that deals with the history of colonial oppression, religion, and madness.
Deserves every award."
" Loved it
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,9,"This one of the best ""true story"" movies I've ever seen. This movie jumps around to many different languages, none of which are English. So if u cant read subtitles this isn't the movie for you but it will be your loss."
" Patient, Artful And Significant
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,8,"A patient, artful film based on the real-life travel diaries of a man who explored deep into Amazonian territories and had sustained contact with people groups usually unnoticed and unengaged by the wider world. Occasionally the narrative lines feel a little confused, and at times it's a bit too patient. But where the film really succeeds is in enabling us to - as much as this is possible - to see events through the eyes of those who live in the land being explored, and not falling into to the all too common white saviour tropes. If the film also sometimes feel alienating. - especially in the closing minutes - it may be because of precisely this device which is what sets the film apart and makes it one that deserves to be seen and taken very seriously."
" A white man's journey through another world
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,8,"The movie is about two different separated European men, that are on a solo journey of discovery in the deep jungles of South America in the early 1900s. And both seek help from a isolated shaman of the indigenous people of that jungle. What we see is that the white man and the shaman comes from different worlds, because to say different cultures would be a way to mild of an explanation, no, different worlds. Movie is told in two separate timeliness also; one some years before the other one. But both about the same thing.It's about the new vs the old, meaning the ways of modern world that we know today in contrast or in battle with an more ancient way of looking at things. From the white men comes the scientific, pragmatic and factual modern view of the world. Against the shaman's way of looking at things, were facts and sience doesn't matter and the belief in dreams and intuition matters so much more or is the only thing that matters.The movie is very beautiful, the way it flows and the cinematography. But a bit long, I have to admit. And don't expect a action movie! But very beautiful movie. I myself am very accustomed to the modern world and enjoy living in it. But this movie still has a lot interesting views and concepts. A good and beautiful movie, although a bit long and slow."
" A faint scent of 'Heart of Darkness' by Joseph Conrad
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,9,Another example of how historically everything white men touch turns to pain.
" Unforgettable
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,10,"Antonio Bolivar is a new victim of covid-19, and this april month of 2020 starts without a man who allowed people from the whole world to approach Amazonas reality. This respected Huitoto, actor in two films, will remain as the face of an out of time indigenous dimension of life."
" somewhere up the river
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,10,"I had never heard of Theodor Koch-Grunberg or Richard Schultes before watching ""El abrazo de la serpiente"" (""Embrace of the Serpent"" in English), so that made it all the more fascinating. Ciro Guerra's Academy Award-nominated movie tests your attention span: in black and white with limited music, no big names, and spoken mostly in indigenous languages, you really have to stay alert with this one.The movie is a tribute to the lost indigenous cultures of South America, as an Amazonian shaman leads two different men up a river - the serpent of the title - thirty years apart in search of a sacred plant. It takes place in the context of the Amazon rubber boom, with the army ready to go after any perceived impediment. Not to mention the treatment by Catholic missionaries. Basically, colonialism never ended.Among the indigenous words that we learn are yakruna (the sacred plant) and chullachaqui (a hollow spirit). But more than anything we get a feeling of the South American jungles in their natural state, undisturbed by modernity. As a character in John Sayles's ""Men with Guns"" said, sometimes it's good to go where there are no white people.Definitely see it."
" So real, that I even forgot I was watching a movie...
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,9,"This is the story of two worlds meeting in one: the amazon jungle. I was fascinated by the beauty of the jungle, and charmed imagining tribes still living there. I was devastated by the horrible things we are doing to them, without even being conscious of that.We'll follow the story of a white man who goes to the amazon to meet a shaman who will hopefully cure his ""illness"". The film is structured in two different times, past and present - separated by 40 years- where two different men go to meet the shaman. Two different men, but the same reincarnation through the eyes of the shaman. The story was not important itself - personally speaking - the importance was in all the meaning it brings with it. Two worlds, two cultures, two times, two beliefs... meeting in one. Following the characters we'll visit the jungle together discovering the deepest meaning of its existence. Tribes in their habitat, in their time, in their world... and then the arrival of our religion, our beliefs, our problems. We brought our world, into theirs. A shaman that lives isolated from his tribe believing it was destroyed by a war, a shaman who uses natural remedies and isn't connected with his own people who changed because of us, the external world. A shaman who is so connected to essential things of life, in contrast with ""us""... again, we always carry so many objects. This is a feeling I lived when I was in India... we give so much importance to our objects, and we often forget the real values of life. Cultures, Origins, ways to live... all of these things makes us different, and we should all respect that. Not interfere. We are destroying a culture, we are killing people, we are killing an era.. because of ""material"" things of ""our"" world... we are damaging nature, the amazon and the tribes, without even realising it... we are killing a world, replacing it with our beliefs. With our desire of always wanting more... and more... and more... and at the end we get less. And we don't see that.This is the story of a world destroying another one, in a magical place that will not survive for long if we keep going this way: the amazon jungle. So real, that I even forgot I was watching a movie... maybe because it isn't."
" Embrace a masterpiece
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,10,"Embrace the Serpent (2015) is a black and white cinematic masterpiece now showing on Hulu.
The story of the relationship between Karamakate, an Amazonian shaman and last survivor of his people, and two scientists who work together over the course of forty years to search the Amazon for a sacred healing plant.
Directed by the auteur hands of Columbian director Cirro Guerra."
" A brilliant jungle mission cinematic masterpiece
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,10,"Embrace the Serpent (2015) is a jungle mission tale and international film by the genius of Columbian director Ciro Guerra, co-written with Jacques Toulemonde Vidal. Set in the jungles of South America, an Amazonian shaman known as Karamakate, well played by actor Nilbio Torres, leads two scientists, played by Belgium actor Jan Bijvoet and Brionne Davis, an actor actually from from Paris, Texas. The scientists follow a shaman on a quest to uncover the secrets of a rare, white healing flower known as yakruna.
Jan Bivoet plays Theo, who is struck by deathly illness from the jungle and needs the flower for healing. Briones Davis plays Evan who is an ethnographer who occasionally spins his antique style record player in the midst of the jungle night for relaxation. The story is at times a bit kooky by filled with humanity and important homage to Columbian native culture. One uniqueness of the story reveals a younger and older version of the shaman Karamakate. It is based over journals created through a forty year span.
The film premiered on May 15th at 2015 Cannes Film Festival Directors Fortnight section where it earned the acclaim of the Art Cinema Award. The film is told in black and white with carefull attention to masterful stoicism and crafted cinematography revealing a unique fashion as black and white cinematic piece and with auteur hands uncovering moments from the travels diaries, spanning over 40 years, of Theodor Koch-Grunberg and Richard Evan's Shultes. In ways it is similar to the masterpieces and cinematic triumphs of Roland Joffe' film The Mission (1986) and Alfonso Cuaro'n's Roma (2018).
The end reveals actual photography from the travels of the two scientists.
A masterpiece with unique heartfelt personality. Brilliant."
" WASTE OF TIME
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,1,"What a boring movie. Maybe it's me. It's just not my genre. I can't be politically correct and say that I liked this movie. I went to sleep watching it on Amazon. Save your time if you secretly want to be like all the other ""in"" people. Skip this one."
" As one of those trips that mark your life.
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,9,"""El abrazo de la serpiente"" is a film of sublime quality, as it had not been seen in South America for a long time. And this is saying a lot, given that South America is going through a very good moment in terms of the level of its film productions.
The recreation of the historical period is perfect. We do not know exactly how things looked at that time, or how people behaved. But that does not matter. The important thing is that this movie makes you feel like you are there.
The sound design is simply beautiful and touching.
The photography is impeccable. An epic artistic work manipulating lights and shadows to strengthen the story.
The plot is solid, touching, mobilizing, and at the same time leaves the audience full of deep dilemmas.
Above all, it stands out what the actors and the director achieve in terms of performances. Every gesture, every word, every sigh of the characters has an infinite truth."
" Thank you!
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,10,"This film is about us, yes us. The heart of darkness, The Secret Sharer, the search for truth. Beautiful Spiritual interpretations from Buddha to the vikings, from Aboriginal folklore to rap. Thank you for this beautiful film. Yes a 10!"
" Hard work, but beautiful in so many ways
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,7,"I was tempted to give this 5 or 6 as I have to confess I did find it hard work to get to the end. Maybe I was just having an impatient day when I watched it, or maybe it was just slow in parts, or maybe it was a combination of both.I ended up giving it a seven as it is quite simply a stunning work of art on so many levels. The cinematography is picture perfect. There are countless images that are so beautiful they could be framed as stills.In addition to the amazing imagery and images applause also have to go to the acting. There are many brilliant performances where the agony and ecstasy of life oozes through every frame.I would have loved to have given it a 9 or even a 10, but from a story perspective it just didn't grab me and suck me in as other movies have done. I wanted to feel empathy for the characters, but it would have been forced and as such, unnatural. Yes, the characters were very well portrayed and the performances were faultless, but I just struggled to connect. Again, this could just have been a personal thing for me on the day. Maybe if watched it a second time I may feel differently."
" deep
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,9,"Mysterious and deep movie, you have to meditate about what it means, great depiction of native tribes and their wisdom"
" History, metaphors, and entheogens
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,9,"A great flick, based on two scientists tracing the same path 30 years apart, in search of a mythical plant - one hopes it will heal him, the second claims the same, but really wants it because it might aid the rubber industry that hired him.Saying more would spoil the story. It may help to know that the dietary rules imposed upon both scientists, are required before taking ayahuasca - one plant yields a form of DMT that is broken down in the gut by the mono-amine-oxidase enzyme; the second contains an MAO inhibitor, so that the dmt can make it to the bloodstream, and brain. Blocking the MAO enzyme makes many common foods poisonous - hence the need for at least a week of strict dietary prep, before taking ayahuasca. That shamans figured this out, and westerners are still trying to figure it out, is pretty remarkable."
" If You Can Bear Viewing...
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,5,"...the Amazon Rainforest filmed in black-and-white, then this, if you are truly spiritual, will be one of the best films you have ever seen. The Christendom presented is historically accurate, sadly, while the two main Amazons (of two different tribes) quote appropriate verses, in Spanish. from the Bible to refute a false Catholic teacher in one scene. This is the Valhalla Rising of films about South America."
" An extremely well crafted film documentary style
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,10,"Shot in Black and white. The power of this movie is it is such an analogy to the world today. Many forces fighting to destroy what is left of the humanity of us.
It's shot simply and starkly. Even the use of Black/White verses color, makes you focus more on the story and the message inside the movie.Yes, you have to 'work' with the movie.. You just don't sit there like an ADD vegetable, ingesting by osmosis. It makes you think. Normally black/white, foreight language movies are not my cup of tea. But those factors help to make it all the more driving.It moves a little slow, but its a complex story with many factors, and positions in it.Worth the watch.."
" Instsant Classic
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,10,"My favorite film of 2015 - by far. The concerns two ethno-biological investigative journeys into the deep Amazon - by an European and an American at the beginning and end of the twentieth century. Ironically, they are guided to their destinations by the same shaman, the surviving member of his tribe, at both ends of his life. A film which says, if not all, a lot about our own culture and the impasse which industrialized society has reached. I particularly enjoyed the filmmakers' attempt to reach beyond material explanations in their analysis og what our world has become and our relation to it as individuals. Best of all, filmed in glorious black and white."
" Would rather watch a documentary
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,6,"This is a decent story of one of the last of a certain Amazonian people leading two separate white men to a healing plant over a long period of time. It's interesting and it's a decent adventure but it's more about showing the way of some Amazonian people and the damage that white people have done to their way of life over time. Like I said it's interesting but the whole way you kinda just feel like hey I want to learn more about these people. You see how they think about pictures (which is similar to how Native Americans felt), and you just want to see how they feel about more things. Throughout the story you do get these thoughts and how they perceive things but it'd almost be better to just see a comprehensive documentary. The journey isn't that interesting but the interactions between the different cultures is and that's what drives the film. It also looks amazing which does add something to it. I for sure became to like that guide (Karamakate) but I just kinda lost interest in the ""story"" of the search for that plant."
" A truly phenomenal film
",2018-06-08 00:00:00,10,"Phenomenal account of two explorers, 30 years apart, trying to find a mysterious healing plant in the Amazon jungle. We follow their journeys and see how the amazon is set to be torn apart by 'whites'. The shamen that is the last of his tribe leads both expeditions and teaches the explorers what it is to dream, be alive and at one with nature.There is one unforgettable moment when the expedition party encounters a rubber plant extractor. David Gallego's photography and the sound editing is just incredible. It's a unique spiritual experience. A remarkable film."
" A Mythical Allegory of Modern Civilization
",2018-05-24 00:00:00,8,"El Abrazo de la Serpiente is a thoughtful drama of two adventurers and their search for how to connect with the spiritual world of the Amazon rainforest. The movie implies notions of magical realism the convey an otherworldly feeling about the setting and how the people perceive their surroundings. Although the decision to film in black-and-white might put off some viewers at first, the movie's cinematography doesn't lack impressive exterior shots and draws the viewer's attention more towards the characters. In the end, El Abrazo de le Serpiente becomes an inherent progressive - if not overtly positive - view on tradition and cultural heritage, and is thus thematically much richer, than first the eye.Overall 8/10

" Mesmerising.
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,9,What a wonderful film. 2 hours of discovery in the Amazon jungle. Beautifully shot in black and white. Minimal and stark. Contemplative and terrifying. Mesmerising.
" What an amazing film!
",2017-11-03 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a special experience, taking us into the exotic Amazon jungles. When I'm watching, I'm not really sure whether I'm in Brazil, Argentina, Peru or Colombia. It's a little confusing but at times we do learn from the small details. Though, it doesn't matter too much. What strikes me is the way South America as a whole is a mixed pot of all the influences from other continents, particularly Europe... and how the native people are opposed to these changes. That for me is the heart of this film, this conflict between the native and the foreigner. There's sometimes a few clichés in this regard but the film does well to minimize this... that is the usual evil white man vs. the wise native. Nevertheless, this film is wise and deals with some big questions about man's greed, the exploitation of natural resources for dark means, corruption in nature and religion. I don't agree with everything it has to say, but whatever it did say was quite powerful and Embrace is an experience that is worth sacrificing your time for. There's not many films like it."
" Deep
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)Not just relating to the Amazon River but the introspection of depth that the man seeking a rare healing plant must dive into in order to find it. That is the core story line but there is much more to it and open to one's personal perspectives. The film is shot in rich black and white and has two timelines. Two white men, 40 years apart or so locate the same native who knows where to find the plant. So you get the see the native as a young buck and a wise old man. The two timelines allow the viewer to see the effect of some modern cultures that have slipped into their primitive world over time. Yet another story nugget is more spiritual. Both searches (old and new) are on long journeys through the jungle and as they search the native encourages the white man to help locate the plant by looking into his soul and feel for it and ask the jungle for help. Pretty interesting film with great cinematography, authentic cultural scenes and some very surreal moments yet some may find the pace a bit sluggish."
" The dreamlike odyssey of this movie feels important and tragic
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,8,"The dreamlike odyssey of this movie is important and tragic. It has revelation in its bones, not of profundity but of empathy. This movie is about more than the raping of entire cultures at the hands of colonialists and rubber barons, it's about the inescapable sadness in the human condition that results from an unfeeling universe. An entire culture torn asunder to be no more. One man, Karamakate, as its last shadow, barely able to remember even the most basic of his people's recipes, let alone the faces of those he loved. Doomed to be forgotten forever. It's not just the loss of homeland and trees but the loss of the spiritual side of nature and the planet around us. The reduction of things to ""things.""As a last hurrah, Karamakate saves one white man by showing him the limits of his own imagination -- a last attempt at preserving what once was, what can still be.Impeccable shot with black and white cinematography. Its purpose seems to be that the world has been blanked of color. Its meaning stripped down to its barest essentials."
" Most powerful message ever portrayed in a film.
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,"The way I saw it was, that Caapi (Ayahuasca) was calling the 2 white scientists via the spirits into the jungle, first with Theodor Koch- Grunberg, you can tell this when Karamakate has visions of the jaguar, telling him he must protect Theo after drinking Caapi, Karamakate realises that he must share the ancient healing brew with the white man before it is lost forever, but the anger he has for the white man is too strong and he ends up burning what he thinks is the last Yakruna. Somehow even after dying in the jungle Theo's diary's manage to make it back to the white man via Theo's guider companion Manduca, in the other half of the film many years on Richard Evans Schultes enters the rainforest met by an older wiser but inevitably lost Karamakate, he has lost all memory of his traditions and the art of making Caapi, Karamakate is chullachaqui an empty person unable to speak with nature any more or dream,Richard manages to find the location of Karuna through Karamakate's drawings on the rocks from years ago, Richard guides them to the plant with his compass, there in the mountains they find one last Yakruna flower, Karamakate saying ''you have to come one with it, it's our last hope'', Richard's white man ego still manifesting in the form of saying they need the rubber, Now I think he makes Richard drink it instead of saving the plant, because it's not the plant that will save humankind but the human soul itself. putting the emphasis on the teachings and the way of life than just the brew itself. I see this film as very prophetic, maybe the single most important juncture of human history as it all hangs on the balance of these Amazonian teaching's of Biophilia and the Transcendental ''spirit'' realm as our guiding force reaching the white man and dissolving our ego's to inevitably save it all from apocalypse. This In my opinion is the most powerful film ''as in the message'' ever made."
