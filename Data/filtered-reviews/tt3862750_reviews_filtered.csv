" Just a brief thought on this thriller.
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,6,"The perfect guy is the kind of flick your girlfriend is half way through watching when you get home and even though you know exactly what will happen scenes before they do, you sit down and watch the rest with your partner as it chugs along.This was a flick I always said to watch when I wasn't there and I found myself enjoying it.It's well paced, some solid supporting cast and the escalation of the antagonist doesn't feel forced.Give it a shot.... When there's nothing else."
" Disappointing script
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,3,I know for a fact that Michael Ealy is good. But this movie didn't do him or any of the other actors any justice
" What a Moon Moon. ðŸ™„
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,2,"If anything good is to come out of this movie, I hope it's that people will not want to be the kind of simp that is Leah Vaughn.This is infuriating!"
" Predicting but not terrible.
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,3,"It was cliche and predictable but not completely terrible. Acting was half decent compared to some other movies like this but I still don't think I will go out of my way to see it again. If you want to waste some time, I recommend it. But if you want decent acting with unpredictable story lines, go watch something else."
" BORING
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,5,"Predictable but that's not an easy, it's just extremely boring. I did like the ending though."

" The not so perfect guy
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,6,This was about a woman named Leah who break up with her boyfriend and get involve with a guy who she thought was perfect which she didn't know was monster from within who called carter which wasn't his real name when she discovered the truth. She try different efforts but couldn't barely ward off the obsessive guy who stalk and prey on her like a animal.
" Cliche plot, bad acting, bad script
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,2,"This felt like watching a middle-school play as far as the script and acting goes. I gave it a shot as it came up on auto-play after watching a different movie on Hulu (read: I was too lazy to change the ""channel"" so I left it playing). The beginning wasn't awful, so I'd hoped it would turn out to be a decent film.
It got bad quickly, however. I just could not get over the awful acting and horrendous dialogue. The plot itself was a bit ridiculous too: although not entirely implausible, it was just over-the-top.
I won't spoil anything just in case, but I can't recommend this movie."
" TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,6,"Lea (Sanaa Lathan) has the prefect boyfriend (Morris Chestnut) except he doesn't want kids. She meets another perfect man Carter (Michael Ealy) who drinks the same coffee as she does. She dumps one for the other and soon discovers Carter has some anger management issues and doesn't take rejection that well. This then turns itself into a mediocre stalker film adding nothing new to the genre.The film starts off really slow and takes awhile to get to the meat of the film. They could have shown some negative background on Carter to hold our interest, but that would eliminate the surprise plot spoiler element they put into every trailer anyway.Guide: No nudity. Minor sex scene. 1 F-bomb near end."
" Great thriller
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,9,Great psycho film. Kept me gripped all the way through
" Not bad, not good, just meh....
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,5,"This is one of those movies that could have been so much more than what we get on film. The characters had great potential, and there were 3 fairly good performers in the 3 lead roles. And a great supporting cast highlighted to me by Holt McCallany as Detective Hansen. The weakest performer to me was Michael Ealy. He played his character from the beginning as too one note. Even when all the friends and family were seeing him as a good guy in the beginning of their relationship, the way Ealy acted and used his eye movements I never could like him at all. The pacing to me was really bad too. They jumped over so much of the big moments in the first of the movie as if to get to the part of him stalking her. It was like they were rushing to get to what they saw as the good part. But the good part was so predictable. You could almost see everything coming before it happened. I never felt any tension or any feeling of the characters being in danger even though they were. It was a movie with a lot of potential but a big let down."
" The Imperfect Guise
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,6,"The title and story, albeit clichÃ©d and predictable - very much so, The Perfect Guy still ends up being an entertaining romance thriller.The movie does a good job at moving at an appropriate pace, cutting out all the unnecessary drama, which helps a whole lot in keeping the thrill alive.Sanaa Lathan is incredibly gorgeous and exudes a certain level of class, which makes her an absolute joy to watch. Ealy and Chestnut give satisfactory performances and the score also, gets a well deserved thumbs up.My biggest problems with this film, apart from its platitudes, is 1; Leah Vaughn complaining about being dated out, then went on to sleep with Carter in a club... A very dodgy looking club at that. It almost didn't quite make sense, however though, when you look at it from the angle of; ""The director trying to portray bit by bit, from different scopes, the type of person Leah is ""getting in bed with"", you sort of see that scenes purpose. 2. The ending. Carter was smart all through the movie, calm and composed, and instead of being defeated by an intelligent counter attack, he was defeated by what felt like, brute force.Nonetheless, The Perfect Guy was enjoyable. It didn't attempt to be more than what it was. A very solid 6.4/10."
" Pretty good movie
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,8,"This film has received lots of flack, and in my opinion, it is undeserved. The cast is great, every actor does a great job at portraying his/her role. The dialogue is well written too, it flows well throughout. The suspense/thriller aspect of the movie really works very well. And the chemistry between the actors is electric, both in a good and bad way depending on what characters you're talking about. The movie is longer in runtime than I expected and it's more detailed and involved than the stereotypical run of the mill suspense fatal attraction movie, which I of course loved. The film has nice well done pacing to it and the ending sequences are very thrilling and do not disappoint at all. I would suggest The Perfect Guy for any movie goer who enjoys a good, exciting, well made thriller/suspense fatal attraction type thriller. 8/10."
