" Highly recommended for all to see
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,10,"Without a drought this is one of the most under rated movies I have ever seen. John Tavolta is at his best in this movie. John's portrayal of a forger, who is a gifted artist, is wonderful; Christopher Plummer is excellent in his role as his father, and Tye Sheridan works very well playing the son. The rest of the cast also portray their characters well to round off a beautiful story directed by Philip Martin. Why this movie was not marketed to its potential is unknown, but there are no subplots written into the main story which reflect an alternative life style or a green environmental statement. What the focus of the movie is about family dealing with a situation in life we all can relate to. If I had three wishes before I die .... Highly recommended for all to see."
" Sweet
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,9,This is a very sweet movie. I think it is under-rated here.
" The lengths a loving father will go to
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,7,"I watched this movie solely because I wanted to see how three heavy hitting actors (Christopher Plummer, John Travolta and Tye Sheridan) would work together as grandfather, father and son. The net result is excellent even if some of the plot lines are sub par.What makes this movie sing is how a seeming derelict father (Travolta as Raymond Cutter) tries to rebuild a better relationship with his 15 year old son (Sheridan as Will). Ray is released early from a medium length jail term for fraud and forgery. His early release shocks his petty thief father (Plummer as Joseph) and it turn out Ray was sprung by a corrupt judge bought off by another crooked colleague who demands repayment of the bribe by Ray doing an art forgery of a Monet painting in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.And the reason why Ray was willing to risk an even longer sentence doing this latest job, Will is dying of a brain tumor and Ray wants to spend time with him before he dies. After years of dark living and neglect, making up with a 15 year old who has been abandoned, let down and raised by his grandfather is no easy task. Will has three wishes: to finally meet his mother who departed the scene when he was an infant, to get laid and to visit Tahiti. How these three wishes are fulfilled makes for an engaging and at times even funny movie.This is a rough, working class Southie Boston family and all three lead actors do a superb job including the accent. Travolta marries the toughness of a long time criminal with the compassion and love of a father trying to deal with a dying teenage son. Sheridan was one of the pre-eminent teenage actors of the 2010's and reprises this role with the aplomb he is renown for. And the flaws: the Monet switching story is quite implausible and Will Cutter, with the exception of a few medical collapses, comes across as a remarkably fit and spry boy dying of a brain tumor.All up a heartwarming story with some really touching moments."
" Not really worth the Monet...
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,5,"John Travolta is ""Ray"" - an imprisoned master forger who makes a deal with a criminal syndicate: get him out of jail and he will plan and execute a spectacular art heist and substitute his own perfect copy so the museum won't ever know. Once out, he enlists the help of his cranky old father Christopher Plummer and his none-to-friendly teenage son Tye Sheridan and sets about delivering his end of the bargain. The concept is quite good, but the pace is way, way too slow - and although it does eventually build to quite a fun denouement, I had rather lost interest by then. Plummer brings a certain amount of class to the proceedings but the dynamic between Travolta and his, as it turns out, poorly son doesn't really work; and the plots twists are all rather obvious - or predictable at any rate. It could have focussed more on the forgery aspects, but instead strays too close to estranged father/son melodrama for me, sorry."
" Take nothing for granted and love all those around you.
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,10,"Best Travolta movie in a long time and really digs into your heart and makes you realise what's important. Beyond that, great heist movie with a subtle approach ðŸ˜Š"
" A sweet movie
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,7,"Although it is a crime movie, I think the strongest axis of the movie is the relationship between father and son. Both roles are performed (by Travolta and Sheridan) in a very natural and convincing way and the movie leaves you with a warm and softly moving feeling"
" Really Good Movie
",2020-03-09 00:00:00,10,This movie has heart. It is more of a drama. John Travolta is very good in this movie. I thought it was well done.
" Not what I was expecting
",2019-09-18 00:00:00,10,"The synopsis gave me the impression that it'd be a cross between the uk hustle tv series and now you see me. It's not it's about travoltas 15 year son who's got terminal cancer and how he needs to earn money to spent the last six months with him and not be in jail. We see the drug addict mother and Christopher plumber (fantastic as usual). Really great film if not a little 'Bette Midler' there is about 15 mins of total grifter action, the rest is heart felt and a little sad. I would really recommend watching it. Good film"
" Got silly about an hour in
",2019-09-10 00:00:00,4,"Good acting by Travolta and Plummer but switched off when Travolta starts teaching his rebellious teenager son how to mix paints as the 19th century impressionists did (presumably he's going to teach him how to paint as well!) If the forger's that good, why not just con the person who ordered the theft of the original! Would save the hassle of nicking the original!"
" Decent
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,8,One of the best performances by Travolta in many years.
" Daring to be Claude Monet in just in few weeks!!!
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,6,"What about to be a true art impressionist's as Claude Monet in few weeks, well this picture dared to do that, the plot certainly from a twisted mind to think in so absurd premisse, l've try figure out what Travolta expected and had in mind when he'd acepted to make this awful production, more after make this painting copy of this masterpiece using a book's picture as reference was too much, you thinking that it's over??.......silly mistake, all thieves's family went to Museum to take the original, spare me for take a breath for a while, apart all this anomalous have a good moments between a remorseful father and a dying young son and a fine performance from the Christopher Plummer as a cheap thief grandpa!!!Resume:First watch: 2019 / How many: 1 / Source: DVD / Rating: 6"
" A Real Winner
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,8,"I have no idea why so many critics didn't think more of this film. All 3 of the Cutter family (John Travolta, Tye Sheridan & Christopher Plummer) are tetrific. Abigail Spencer, who I first saw in ""Chasing Mavericks"" (2012) with Gerard Butler & Jonny Weston. It is a true story about Jay Moriarity, who at age 16 became a world renowned big wave surfer (aka mavericks), then drowned free diving in the Maldives; only 21 years old. Abyway, Spencer is quite good in this film. It is also good to see Jennifer Ehle in a small role, too. I like the ending very much. Definitely worth a watch."
" THANKS FOR PRETENDING
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,7,"Raymond Cutter (John Travolta) a painting forger, arranges to get out of jail 9 months early at a very high cost. His criminal associate Keegan (Anson Mount) bribes a judge for his release. As payment Ray must forge a Claude Monet. He is on a time schedule as an art collector is in town and the painting is being shown locally. We discover Ray wanted to get out early was so he could spend some quality time with his son Will (Tye Sheridan) who has an inoperable stage 4 tumor in his head. He tells his son he has three wishes. As a subplot a pretty cop (Abigail Spencer) follows Ray around using him as bait for bigger fish.Travolta gives us a good performance as a man bonding with his son once again. This crime drama is more about the drama and personal interaction in the Cutter family than the crime."
" Don't Trust the Negative Reviews
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,6,"The Forger is nowhere near as most critics make it out to be. It has a talented cast, solid pacing, a great family component and a classic Travolta performance. It will keep you hooked throughout. However, it's never surprising and doesn't break any new ground. (3/5)"
" Great actors/mediocre script=Average flick!
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,7,"For me I think the actors carried this film, and done the best with what they are given. I love Tye Sheridan and have been a fan ever since I saw him in the movie ""Mud"". I was at a resell store and saw John Travolta, Christoper Plummer, and Tye Sheridan were in this movie, so took a chance and bought it. There were a lot of holes/pieces missing in the script and it could have been better written overall.. One thing that bothered me was the son was sick, only once did he have issues with his ailment. Most of the time he looked and acted healthy and the movie could have developed this much better into the storyline.. Too there were lots of other holes, huge gaping holes in the plot. Still I won't pan it too much because overall on a slow day I somewhat enjoyed it and the actors in it. Also a bonus was one of the main characters in the film was from the TV series ""Timeless"" which i enjoy, she played the agent. It's sad sometimes movies could have been blockbusters if they were better developed or given more to go on. In this case it was the writing, too it is very similar to a movie I have seen before. See if you can figure out which one I am thinking of and see for yourself if you think it was retreaded!!"
" Real life is not about the heist
",2018-04-21 00:00:00,8,"It is about motives. About loyalty, and how that fades away given the right amount of wrongdoing. It is about seizing opportunity against the odds. Looking for that spark of hope to hold on to. 
Yes, it all ends well, it Ã­s Hollywood after all. But this movie manages to hold on to that gloom of despair for a long time, and shows that it is not all sunshine after the clouds have gone. 
It shows in the end that human existence is short of one main ingredient only; the time spent with loved ones. 
There is a heist in here, there is a cop, some villains and a forgery. It's entertainment, and not the main subject of this movie. 
Well shot, well lit, with ample telling silences. I liked it a lot. I liked the characters a lot, I liked Travolta acting, especially when he acts alongside his ""son"""
" Paying the Price for Freedom
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,6,"Although he only has 10 months left on his prison sentence, ""Raymond J. Cutter"" (John Travolta) makes a deal with a drug dealer named ""Keegan"" (Anson Mount) to bribe a judge in order to get an early release. Of course, Keegan doesn't do things for free and Raymond knows only too well that he will have to make it up to him in some fashion quite soon. Sure enough, the price Keegan demands is that Raymond not only must duplicate a famous painting by Claude Monet but he must also steal the original from the museum and replace it with the copy. Although this is an extremely difficult task Raymond has to accept it if he wants to remain free-and there is an extremely important reason he needs out of prison. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a decent film which managed to successfully encompass two different subplots-at least for the most part. Likewise, John Travolta performed in his usual professional manner as did Christopher Plummer (as ""Joseph Cutter""). Slightly above average."
