" Kids could get exited
",2021-04-11 00:00:00,2,"Naive, one dimensional , flat . Childish, I guess that what the target was... Liked studio shots..."
" An important movie
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,7,I thought the film was unfocussed and too long but it's an important biopic about a cultural revolution.NWA's music was very important to me when I was young but I look back on it now and cringe. The misogyny and the homophobia is jarring.I'm glad I watched it but I could be we call it a great movie.
" Standout movie
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,7,A standout movie in Modern Black History - NWA have confirmed the accuracy of the movie and Ice Cube's son is playing his dad so who am I to say I don't like it. A very good movie that espechially rap lovers will enjoy as well - and you will put the tunes on after the movie.
" It was Pretty Good
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,8,"This film was really good! It's about how NWA was formed, their rise to the top and their subsequent fall. The film uses a lot of the music from the band which is nice if your a fan of gangsta rap and the entire film just feels like an accurate representation of what the band and black Americans were going through at the time. The movie talks about police violence and it's definitely relevant with what's going on at the moment. Great watch, would recommend. :)"
" Great biopic
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,9,"Straight Outta Compton is arguably the best Hip Hop film made in recent history. The film is a fly on the wall perspective of life in South LA. You will see a lot of people giving this film negative reviews because they do not understand what life is like in neighborhoods that American society has a habit of dismissing. I hate to break it to you but the LAPD was and is corrupt. One of the very few ways out of the ghetto is to sell drugs. The movie focuses on the fact that this group, NWA, managed to create amazing music that was a audio roadmap for the hood. The film is raw. This is because late 80s and early 90s Los Angeles was raw. I just wanted to tell others to ignore the 1 or 2 star reviews. They seem to be written by people who have no idea what it is like to be considered an old man in the hood at the age of just 20. The film angers those who do not try to understand. NWA was a group so far ahead of their time and peers. It's sad that decades later many people cannot accept a medium of art that is different than they are used to."
" As a film it's fantastic
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,9,"Quality film.I thoroughly enjoyed 'Straight Outta Compton', it had me gripped all the way through. That's despite me having little to no knowledge of N.W.A, I knew of their name and of Ice Cube and Dr. Dre but basically zilch about their actual story. I couldn't comment on how true it is to history, but as a film it's fantastic.You have great performances from O'Shea Jackson Jr., Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell and Paul Giamatti. Mitchell impressed me most as Eazy-E, while the casting of Jackson as Ice Cube - his father, of course - was a masterstroke. All the cast do very well, in truth.I love how gritty the film is too, it feels real - at least as real as film can get. There is some neat cinematography in there, while the music is entwinned nicely. The pacing is almost perfect, aside from a few moments in the middle. I also rate how it all ends, in terms of the story but also with the end credits. There's heart in there."
" The gist...
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,4,"So ""Straight out of Compton"" is a movie about a bunch of rappers that starts a childish beef and pretty much had lifes that wasn't eventful enough to make a movie about."
" BRLLIANT FILM AND ENJOYABLE TO WATCH
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,9,"This film was amzing to watch, and since I watched in early May I've revisited again, after listening to NWA's music. The acting was fantastic from actors who were basically debutants to large roles in major films, and I think they did a great job. Overall, a brilliant film with actors that portrayed their characters superbly."
" SUGE KNIGHT
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,8,"Really great thing. Story was amazing and also really grrrreat way to get informed about NWA. One thing only... Suge Knight was one of the deadliest men in the music industry back in the day and also maybe he was the deadliest ever. He was terrifying. But, in this movie this dude does not even look scary. I mean it's the actor and the whole thing, like how they portray him. That was really bad cause he could have been an amazing villain"
" Major issues as historic representation
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,3,"NWA were involved in electro before NWA. The story of NWA did not unfold as it did in the movie, even though there is a scene of DRE spinning an electro record that he did not produce, it completely overlooks DRE and NWA, releasing full EPs of electro material.Moreover, have you seen the graffiti in the movie. Now look at archives of graffiti from those years? Do they match? Not even close. The graffiti depicted is cutting edge graffiti by today's standard. As this is a hip-hop culture piece, it fails to properly address the culture properly. Which is ridiculous.The issue here is that this is barely history. To get such details wrong, and there are others, only 3 decades after the fact is really saying something about this an adequate representation of hip-hop culture. It's entertaining but dismally flawed."
" Not completely honest but worth a watch
",2020-09-08 00:00:00,8,"I didn't personally grow up with NWA's music but I'm aware of how impactful this group was to the music industry and I think this film will please fans of the NWA.Straight Outta Compton is about the formation of the well known rap group NWA, their impact on the music industry and the difficulties they faced as a group.Whilst the film is about the NWA, it mainly focuses on three of its members: Ice Cube, Eazy-E and Dr. Dre. I really enjoyed Straight Outta Compton. I loved how it showed scenes of them writing and performing their music. It conveyed the passion they had for music whilst living in a dangerous area. I thought F. Gary Gray managed to show the dangerous aspects of Compton in a great way. The editing of the film was done really well. The first half didn't feel like it was slowing down which left me fairly engaged with the story. The second half is where the film did get more dramatic and that's where I thought it started to slow down a bit but despite that I never felt bored. I think the issue with the film is its accuracy. Since Dr. Dre and Ice Cube produced this film, I think a fair amount of events weren't depicted as it would them look bad which does make sense. However, I do wish the film had been more honest with its story.The performances in this movie make the film really good. I enjoyed seeing some of the cameos of musical artists at that time. The casting for that was really done since so many of them resembled the look of the real life people and managed to act like them. O'Shea Jackson Jr., who is Ice Cube's son, plays the role of his father really well. Corey Hawkins does an excellent job as Dr. Dre and Jason Mitchell really surprised me with his performance as Eazy-E. Another surprise was Paul Giamatti who played the group's manager. He also did a very good job portraying Jerry Heller.Straight Outta Compton really worked for me. I loved F. Gary Gray's approach to this story and it addressed a few issues that still place in the world today. I still wish it had more honesty but I was thoroughly entertained by the story and the performances."
" Should have been better
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,6,"This is a movie that should have been more than the sum of its parts. It should have been about young gifted artists who transcend the horrors of their environment, their upbringing (though none of them had abusive families here), and discovered either themselves or were given insight into how the world works. Especially now that we know more about police brutality and the school to prison pipeline.But unfortunately, this doesn't happen. If we take this movie as fact, how does a young drug dealer who can't stay on beat suddenly become a rapper and perform in front of sold out crowds. And since Ice Cube (one of my favorite actors) is the one with the real talent, it doesn't show here with his penned lyrics . . . until we hear Straight Outta Compton. That was tight.But how did he get there. After a few more songs, I didn't hear genius anymore, just a lot of repetition. Yes, his lyrics captured the reality of his environment, but that's all it did, and it did glamorize violence. It did nothing to portray the sadness, the tears, the tragedy in his life. Just a lot of banging ho's and shooting up n*ggas. I'm sorry, but I believe the real life NWA did more than that.Unless I'm wrong. I hope not. They gave their community a voice but did little else but play into the game of police brutality and incarcerating their brothers and sisters. I only wish they had the insight to have done more in life and in fiction."
" Very good
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,9,"The story, just as we all know and it's been told. Great portrayals and soundtrack."
" White Sox didn't change logos until 1991
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,2,"First sign of trouble was Eazy E wearing a White Sox hat in the beginning when the group was forming in 1987.Only problem with that is he didn't wear that hat until 1991, when the White Sox changed their logo.Somebody looked at a photo of Eazy E and didn't take the time to figure out when the photo was taken and do their homework.That is what this movie is in a nutshell. It's not based on historical accuracy and actual descriptions of what took place.It is a big studio glamorization of a group which was never glamorized during their controversial tenure. Most of the dark areas of their lyrics and incidents are glossed over and ignored.One of the founding members is cut out of the movie entirely as if he didn't even exist.Total trash."
" A good and relevant biopic
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,8,"Usually I find biopics you be annoying and cheesy, but this is a very good film. The scenes of police brutality, for example, were very powerful and I find them more relevant today than ever, unfortunately... Acting was very good throughout. Directing and writing were very decent as well. Finally, a decent biopic!"
" Too conventional
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,6,"I had high hopes with this movie, but i did not get too excited seeing it. Some cliches about Black comunity confruntations with the police (I am not saying they are not reality based, but they are given in a too standard way and nothing out of common). The events are depicted without too much power or personality. I saw this movie out of curiosity for Eazy E, but I can say the actor who plays him is not a tenth of the rappers badass attitude. Missed opportunity to make a real good movie."
" Not good. Producers soothing their egos.
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,5,"I'm really glad some user reviews on here are actually truthful. Because it's Dr Dre (apparantly he can't do no wrong etc). Before I even see the film I knew Dre and Cube with their inflated egos would make themselves look great in this...oh a suprise.Secondly all the massively racial comments that literally come from zero brainpower. ""Why the cops always picking on us?"" Erm maybe because you think you're so innocent yet you're actually filming the fact you take lots of drugs, you pop caps in people's asses, erm you stop a bus and threaten a little kid with a gun. Maybe just maybe that's why the police pull you over because oh, you're just soooo innocent aren't you.Unbelievable I had to turn it off."
" Allowing Instagram to Decide What I Watch While in Isolation Day 8
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,8,"The (mostly) true story of N.W.A is the sort of film that never let's up. There is no real downtime within the near two and half hour run time. For fans of classic hip-hop this feels like a non-stop roller coaster ride through iconic stories and important moments in the genre's rise into the mainstream. That said I can totally imagine that for someone who is less familiar with the key players in the story the fast paced nature may be slightly off putting.Personally, I think this might be one of the best musician bio-pics ever made and a must see for all hip-hop fans."
" This Review is Straight Outta IMDb
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,6,"I liked watching this film enough to keep watching it. But, this film has a few historical inaccuracies because it has been Hollywoodized to some extent. What this film lacks is the full brutal reality of how the members of N.W.A. did terrible things to become famous and have powerful careers during a time where white supremacy influenced the American government that caused black people to be unrealistically depicted as criminals, gangsters, and drug addicts just because they were black people even though black people were the ones being unfairly oppressed by white people and black people who worked for the American government. Honestly, this film didn't pay enough attention to all members of N.W.A. It focused on Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, and Ice cube the most. Speaking of members of N.W.A. Members of N.W.A, Snoop Dogg, black activists, and other people were finishing what Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X, and Stokely Carmichael started after the 1960's to make sure that black people had equal access to opportunities in America. However, this film made Eazy-E look increasingly weak in this film in an insulting way. Ice Cube became a Hollywood sell-out and was a pugnacious jerk to girls and guys. Dr. Dre was arrogant when he was young until he got screwed over in the music industry that had censorship, soul-selling contracts that underpaid artists, and manipulative perverts who were discreetly doing drugs, pedophilia, brainwashing of their clients, sexual harassment, B.D.S.M, and other things. That's why the celebrities got psychologically screwed up in the music industry. Celebrities became drug addicts, pedophiles, brainwashed, sexual predators, and immoral opportunists in the music industry. I feel that members from the N.W.A. got psychologically screwed up and got more corrupt in the music industry. I could feel the pain, struggling, hustling, and sincerity in the actors when they portrayed the characters in this film. So, I appreciate what the actors did in this film. I don't think O'Shea Jackson, Jr. looks like Ice Cube. O'Shea Jackson, Jr. and Ice Cube have their physical differences if you pay good attention to both of their bodies. From my experience, I think O'Shea Jackson, Jr. and Ice Cube are both handsome, talented, smart, and assertive hustlers who get things done. Jerry Heller looks like the Hollywoodized Jew that would screw someone over in the music industry. Besides that, this film has great music, good enough writing, talented actors, scenes that are convincing, and a diversity of characters representing real people to some extent."
" getting it real
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,10,My fave music movie. outstanding acting directing and editing. a story we think we know from a different angle brings me back to a younger me
" Better than what I thought it would be
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,8,Great cast who portrayed their characters brilliantly. Obviously a fantastic soundtrack. I don't believe you have to be a fan of hip hop or rap to enjoy this film. At times It portrays how young African Americans were treated at the time. A well made film well worth watching.
" An interesting look at Compton rappers
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,7,"As I've always been interested in the old-school rap, this film definitely intrigued me. It was a really enjoyable experience. There was solid acting and a solid script, having had me hooked for the whole film. To see how these young and black people were opressed, but still made it was really interesting to see and I definitely recommend anyone watching it if you like the music."
" Awesome
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,8,I loved it. But I'm a big Eazy E fan. Fun to watch the entire story unfold. Very good.
" Very Entrertaining Movie
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,10,I could watch it again and again and still enjoy it.
" Straight Outta Compton - Great film
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,10,I mean going into watch this film and never listened to NWA in my life was a pretty big deal as at the time when they were around I was into NKOTB. Never really got the whole gangster rap scene but after watching this film I completely done a 180 and now love their music also want to point out I'm an eclectic fan of music now. I'll say this about this film though it was an absolutely brilliant film. Loved every minute of it and to be perfectly honest I love long films over short ones. I feel the longer the film the more effort goes into the finished product.The casting was spot on to the point I turned to my friend saying whoever played Ice Cube in this film they nailed only to find out who he was - only Ice Cube's son.I've watched this a few times now and I still can't get enough of it. 10/10
" Overrated
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,6,"It's not a bad movie, but it's too long, definitely not worth the 1/10 or 10/10 reviews. Music is good"
" For a Compton neophyte such as myself, pretty damn good
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,6,"Considering I know little about the group N.W.A and their chequered history going into this movie, it held my attention well enough.Who knew such musical luminaries as Dr. Dre and Ice Cube had such interesting pasts? I wasn't aware of Eazy E before, but poor guy. And obviously, the music is wall-to-wall rap, so if that's your jam prepare yourself for an aural treat.And that's not even to mention the constant violence and bad language... but I suppose, considering the rough neighbourhood these guys came from, the racism of the police and the various 'grudges' the group members had along the way, it does kinda come with the territory.This genre of music and gang culture is not really my thing, but by the end of this two-and-a-half hour 'epic' I didn't feel bored, and indeed I was quite enlightened as to what life was like during this period in history when N.W.A's and their contemporaries music began making it big.Or in the unique wording of our profane protagonists 'this  is DOPE'. 6/10"
" Super Awesome
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,10,As a musician and huge fan of their music...this movie allowed me an insight into their lives and I loved it
" Straight up story based on real life
",2019-09-30 00:00:00,8,"I should note that having watched for instance also ""The Dirt"" about Mötley Crüe and checking some of the background story, that not exactly checking out a 100% of the time but touching the truth instead, I don't know what part of this story is real and what part isn't. I can only say how it felt watching this movie...It didn't feel like Straight Outta Compton sugarcoated anything. It was more like a straight-up kind of experience with people using, abusing, walking into every single pitfall you may imagine no matter what ""side"" they choose to be on. The choices the based-on-real-life characters make are wrong a lot of the time, undermining the very opportunities presented to them by themselves, which is something they needed to recognize or maybe learn not to ignore.Pitfalls... Not knowing that as an artist you're the business, not some manager, any manager, that steps up to you saying that say, ""Hollywood"" or whatever is the business. You have to have produce and you need to sell. That's something they themselves had to figure out. They were doing good, doing better didn't mean signing with a manager, it meant hanging in there. Did they need a manager? If they did, why had the manager already heard of them then?Acting on impulses, listening to bad advice, that all led to trouble. Some lived to learn, some died, in real life too as we all very well know. I'm sorry to see not all lived to learn, but the movie, even though it can only be partially true to life, I think it's a fair warning. Do the business, enjoy your life but don't live it up beyond, sorry but I have to say it, love, keep working, don't fuck it up.That's the one thing the movie didn't do that I do : rub morals into your face. Sorry for that. Don't listen to me, watch the movie and draw your own conclusions."
" Dissapointing with a very convoluted plot.
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,4,"Just recently rewatched this and my main problem is lack of character development and the ""plot,"" if you even want to call it that.The plot isn't cohesive whatsoever. The plot starts out okay, I did like the introduction to all the main characters, but after that, it's all downhill. It's like this movie just skims through the NWA Wikipedia page very sloppily. That could work for a documentary, but it doesn't work for an actual feature film/story, it gets so boring. A feature film needs a cohesive plot and narrative. Even just random scenes happen just cuz they happened in real life or based on real life events. Just because something happened in real life doesn't mean you should put it in the story. When you're telling the story based off real life, you need to trim the fat. Like for example, Snoop Dogg randomly shows up, then we pretty much never see him again for the rest of the movie. His character and appearance adds nothing to the plot or anything. They just put him there because he's Snoop Dogg.Also lack of character development. They are just mostly angry most of the movie, and no real growth near the end. I would've gave Easy-E the most to do, most character development, and humanize him the most because he obviously dies at the end. They also sidelined MC Ren and DJ Yella. I know they are the lesser known members, but that's an ever better reason to give them more to do, they had do be doing more behind the scenes that most don't know about. That's another problem with this movie, they mainly just skim through most stuff that NWA fans and most Hip-Hop fans already knew, like the basic stuff. If you're an NWA fan, you're gonna learn nothing new in this movie about them. So what's the point? Unlike the Prince movie, ""Purple Rain,"" you learn so much about his life and struggles that most people didn't know before the movie's release. ""Purple Rain,"" an actual good music biopic. I would've forgave ""Straight Outta Compton"" for just telling us the basic details of their life if the plot and character development were amazing and engaging, but they weren't, they sucked.Then the movie ends with Dr. Dre saying, ""I'm gonna start Aftermath."" Cool, how does that even correlate with the rest of the movie? Barely anything correlates in this movie. As I said before, just because that's what Dre did in real life doesn't make it okay. If I made a story of my life, I wouldn't include so many random details all randomly stringed together, that's just bad writing, doesn't matter if everything I said actually happened. There still has to be a cohesive narrative.And don't tell me I don't understand this movie because I'm not from the hood or not a Hip-Hop head, etc. That's irrevant, a good story is a good story. I'm not from the Hood, but think ""Boyz-N-The-Hood"" is a 10/10 movie. Doesn't matter what walk of life anyone is from, a good story is a good story, and a bad story is a bad story. Execution of a story is very important. I'm sure there is a great story of NWA somewhere, but this isn't it, because it's executed horribly. It seems like a cheap straight-to-MTV movie."
" What we needed.
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,10,This movie was amazing! People can bash me and tell me that this movie doesn't deserve a 10 but it does. It showed up was the rap game used to be like- raw and unapologetic. N.W.A. Weren't afraid to talk about stuff that bothered them. The ending was perfect. It was sad to see Eazy go at such a young age but he will never be forgotten. One of the best movies I've seen in awhile.
" Straight Outta Compton

" A Masterpiece from the Musicians I grew up listening to.👌🏾
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,10,"This is such a wonderful movie from the days when rappers were rappers, when music was music and when real men stood for their rights. This is such an inspirational story and people need to know it."
" entertaining and powerful
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,7,"Great movie with great acting across the board and great casting to get actors that look like the real people. good story and very interesting to see how much of an effect this story had on society. very moving too (2 viewings, 11/14/2020)"
" Best movie I have ever watched
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,10,"F Gary Gray and Andre Young(Dr Dre) gave us more than just a Wikipedia article about NWA or any of these rappers, it could be even 2 hours longer and you still won't feel boredom throughout watching it"
" dope movie
",2019-06-19 00:00:00,8,"I love the authenticity that this film displays. It captures their trails and tribulations as they rise to become the pioneers of gangster rap. In an era that was dominated by east coast rap, they created a sound from the belly of the beast in the streets of Los Angeles with gang culture."
" Could've been a powerful film, but was too ""Hollywood"" and one-sided
",2019-04-15 00:00:00,4,"I loved this movie when I was younger, but today I could careless for it. It covers no new ground, and tries to uphold the cast as heroes without a strong case. I still enjoy some of their music, but other than the infamous police song and some of Cube's solo work, their music did not uplift the black community or make the world more aware of sociopolitical issues. The movie alludes to that and tries to tell us this, but we see more of the cast trying to act cool than them fighting for a cause, making it unconvincing in my eyes (Although my younger self was fooled). Let's all be honest, no one listens to N.W.A to ""be informed"". Their anger, aggression, and bluntnesss sells the music, and the consciousness is an afterthought (this doesn't mean it's wrong to enjoy them though). This isn't a morality crusade, but simply acknowledging a problem doesn't make you heroic, you have to take initiative to fix it.A lot of people say this movie is raw and gritty because of the swearing, violent imagery, and groupie sex scenes. However, that is more glamor than grit, and despite all the parental advisories about this film (Police at theaters making sure no one under 17 gets in, and FX plays about four different warnings before this film airs), it's very sugar coated and PG compared to the real story of N.W.A. Entire beefs were skipped, and details that made Cube and Dre look like jerks were skipped over too. I'd like to compare this to The New Edition Story. Although that was a PG-13 film, the cast put pretty much every thing on the table, even the details that made them look selfish or foolish, and showed that they did their fair share of dirt, even during their bubblegum pop days, making it feel more raw than this film. Here, we only see these sides of the characters if it makes them look more badass, making the whole experience feel contrived.And we all know that Eazy-E did not cry during the release of The Chronic. His popularity waned a bit from N.W.A's heyday, but he was still releasing music and signing new groups and artists. In fact, he received a portion of The Chronic's income. I did not appreciate the fact that they made him look weak and cowardly in the second half of the film. They made it look like he was nothing without N.W.A, but he fared well as a solo artist and would've further expanded his brand if it wasn't for his unfortunate death.N.W.A's story is vast and includes many characters and artists who followed their influence, so I could see why certain details and people were not included. But when the final product ends up as a sanitized story that boosts up two people and downplays everything else, it makes a very one-sided and dissatisfying film. And although the finale scene was meant to be a declaration of Dre's independence, it came off as very cheesy and overly ""Hollywood"". The way Suge and Dre talked in that scene sounded like something out of a Marvel movie, and was wholly unbelievable. There is some good acting, a few powerful scenes, and little doses of humor throughout the film, but these cannot make up for the storyEdit: The most helpful review on the site claims that the only reason someone could dislike this movie is because it dared to show ""angry black men"". Considering how watered down this film was, they weren't angry enough."

" Gritty, inspiring and impressive
",2019-03-28 00:00:00,8,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in recent years. I missed it at the cinema, as I was doubtful it would be any good but having now seen it three times, I thought I'd add this review.I had bought the album of the same name some years ago but never knew the background story, which turns out to be very inspiring and thoroughly engaging.Rap legends Dr Dre, Ice Cube and Easy E formed NWA in the late 80s. This biopic tells the riveting story of the band and their stereotypically manipulative manager Jerry Heller and we see some appearances from other characters along the way, like Snoop Dog, Suge Knight and Jimmy Iovine. It focusses on the formation of the band, their music and the events which drove their creativity. Fans of the original album, like myself, will probably get bonus enjoyment from seeing some tracks performed during the movie.The gangster myth surrounding the band is put in the spotlight here. These kids were no saints but they weren't hardened gang members and had the sense and drive to take their lives in the right direction. There's little difference, aside from the music, between the likes of NWA and other controversial bands like Motley Crue, yet the establishment's prejudice saw them as thugs and criminals.It's nothing entirely new - other band stories follow a similar theme of inception, climb to fame, controversy and turmoil, band splits, etc. but Straight Outa Compton has fantastic performances from all the cast - especially Jason Mitchell and Paul Giamatti - and is gripping on three levels.The first is witnessing the birth of the joint genius of Dr Dre, Cube and Easy E and where it takes them as the story unfolds. The second is the rise of the band and the usual issues that arise from fame and money in the music industry. The third and most powerful is the band's battle against the authorities and, in particular, the FBI. There are no dull moments in this movie and, at nearly 150 minutes, is a solid achievement for the writers and director F Gary Gray.Don't expect the uplifting vibes of Bohemian Rhapsody. It's aptly gritty in places and the movie's tone is in keeping with the hard edge of the band's music.For me, it does justice to their story and is an impressive film."
" A hip hop classic
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,10,"The way i see it is, you don't have to be a fan of hip hop to enjoy this film, even though i am. But seriously i can't fault this film in any way. the acting is brilliant and the structure and pacing made sure it doesn't drag or get boring in any way. And of course the music speaks for itself. I could be considered bias because of my love of 90s hip hop, but i strongly believe this is a top movie in its own right. 10/10 for me."
" Overall great
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,10,"I wasn't sure how I'd feel about this one, but knew I wanted to watch it. I grew up when all of this was going on. The film was well done, and I loved O'Shea Jackson Jr playing his dad."
" The story of how a storm gathers, strikes, and changes everything forever.
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,10,"It is an interesting and perhaps altogether mortifying thing to note that human progress, by and large, takes an awful lot of time. While our technological prowess grows exponentially by the day, threatening to overwhelm us and outrun us as we give it its own consciousness, we fail to understand that it is the very nature of the computer mind to NOT continue to make the same mistakes, over and over again, in pointless, deadly cycles. While that is very much the case for HUMAN minds.I haven't seen a much better case for said behavior than I did in F. Gary Gray's majesty of a movie, STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON. Even though there aren't any Terminators in it, nor are there any real technological threats to be seen. No, the threats noted here are the same, old, TIRED ones.Inequality. Oppression. Indignity. Ignorance.STUPIDITY.You have to admire racism for its stubbornness. It's not enough that people hate each other based on skin color and culture, you have to remember that the people that HAVE the skin color and culture you hate were brought to America against their will. They didn't ask to be here. And you're nothing more than a damned fool to simply say, ""Well then get the hell out"", after ancestors and generations of idiots enslaved, raped, tortured, and murdered them simply to profit from their labor and rise into strong, almost morally bankrupt country as a result. There's a stereotype that's been created here, for African Americans, and this is a movie that's not shy about illustrating that.It doesn't CHAMPION that, it ILLUSTRATES that. There's no judgment here, and that's one of this film's strongest points.When five young men in Compton decide, eventually, to join together to create a new, completely original music genre based on what they have to go through in the America of the late eighties and early nineties, at the resistance of almost everyone who thinks playing it safe is always the best way to go, they create something truly original. Great art comes from great suffering, and these men suffer regularly at the hands of a society that treats them poorly based on appearance more often than actual behavior, illustrated not only by scene but by historical reference throughout the film. What comes out of their mouths and out of their speakers is an outcry of anger, defiance, and resistance, and it is POWERFUL. Great art is also the subject of great change, and that is what these men have started here, with their bravery and talent.I think O'Shea Jackson Jr. (who plays Ice Cube and is, ironically, his son) and Corey Hawkins (who masterfully plays Dr. Dre) steal nearly every scene they are in. They are the brains of the bunch, the smartest and the most talented of the group, and you can see it and feel it in every scene. This is not to say that Jason Mitchell (who plays a touching, charming and moving Eazy-E), Neil Brown Jr. (who plays DJ Yella) and Aldis Hodge (who plays MC Ren) do not have their strengths, because they do. NOBODY in this production has a small role, from the extras in the backgrounds without names to the women that support our five stars as they battle their way to the front. Everyone is rich, the atmosphere is vibrant and alive, the soundtrack is perfectly placed and implemented, even the shots of city-scapes are those of beauty.I've left out Paul Giamatti as Jerry Heller, the man responsible for managing the up-and-coming N.W.A. Without giving away too much of the movie, I will say he delivers as he always does, being the perfect middle-man antagonist, that starts out seemingly innocent as he slowly grows into something more sinister.And finally we come to the message, which is this: Nothing is as simple as it seems. Nobody can be ascertained simply by appearance. Things just don't suddenly go wrong. Change does NOT happen overnight. And the biggest, most powerful message of all, the one that nobody learns, even though it's been repeated over and over again as we continue down this merry path to ever more creative means of self-destruction:You can't keep punching people in the face without expecting them to fight back. You can't continue to try to use fear to hold everybody down while you walk away the victorious tyrant. Those that dared to hold these guys down will be forgotten, while the words they said and the music they made will last long after everyone involved in this era of Americana become food for worms.STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is the kind of truth we need right now. And I absolutely loved it."
" You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge.
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,8,"Though 'Straight Outta Compton (2018)' may not be one-hundred percent historically accurate (with some 'undesirable' events being omitted seemingly simply due to the people producing the piece), this extremely entertaining bio-pic cuts to the heart of its story in an impressively acute way, always feeling innately cinematic and properly engaging as it weaves together its complex characters and events into a single narrative. It does brush past, and even entirely omit, a couple of its key players in an effort to focus on the trifecta of Cube, Dre and Easy, but this is just a casualty of a more concise narrative and is, essentially, completely necessarily, if unfortunate, in order for the film to work as well as it does. The two-and-a-half hour picture flies by as it really drives home the messages found within its focal group's music (even the ones they couldn't write into their lyrics) and paints a clear picture of the time, place and general situation that lead to its creation. Plus, all of the flick's actors give near-perfect performances that aren't just imitations and actually recreate the iconic songs themselves. 8/10"
" Wannabe gangster movie
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,2,"STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is another wannabe gangster movie charting the rise of a group of friends who start out as ex-cons and end up becoming worldwide superstars. Unfortunately for me, the subject matter is the music industry rather than drugs or crime, and I'll admit straight away that I have no interest in this NWA group or whatever they were called; I know Ice Cube from his acting career and that's about it. Inevitably this is a film that turns out to go through the motions, full of angry young black guys with a vendetta against society, singing songs full of hatred and misogyny. The film is one-sided and one-note throughout, with no depth whatsoever, and the attempt to make these deeply unpleasant characters sympathetic is quite laughable."

",2018-10-17 00:00:00,10,Great movie showing the rise of rap from the ghettos.
" Pretty good, but not great
",2018-09-06 00:00:00,6,"It's been a while since I've seen this movie, but reading the other reviews, it didn't get a fair treatment in my opinion. It started pretty well, wonderfully highlighting the difficulties these young men went through at the beginning of their careers. The first maybe 45 minutes or so was pretty good. I believe we get to the record deal, but it may have been a little longer. Then the movie kind of slows down. It seems to take forever, and honestly I kind of forgot what happened in the middle. I think the producer dude sells them out and the group breaks up. I'm not sure what happens, I just remember sitting in the theater wondering how much time has passed. Near the end, it seems like the writers realized their movie was over 2 hours and they needed to finish it up. It felt like they quickly mentioned that Ice Cube made Friday, and Easy-E contracted AIDS. Then they wrapped it up in the last thirty minutes with Easy-E's death and I was left wondering if I watched an Easy-E documentary. But all in all, it was a decent movie that was excessively drawn out."
" Very good
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,10,I thought the actor who portrays eazy e was very good and I felt he should have been nominated for an Oscar for it I do not understand why this movie was only nominated for one Oscar.
" Good biographic movie
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,7,"Music is a big part of my life, hip-hop being one of my favourite genres and I've been listening to NWA pretty much since they became famous so naturally I was keen to check this out, especially as I didn't know a great deal about the actual history of the group. Eazy E was arguably NWA's most colourful & controversial member and much of the film is focused on him. On the other hand Yella (who I saw live last year) and Ren sadly don't get much screen time. And apparently there are omissions in actual events too. 
I was in LA on my first trip to the USA during the Rodney King incident, I remember it well, and this is touched upon effectively several times throughout. The film is well made, has a good cast, obviously (if you like rap) has a great soundtrack & despite it's 2.5 hours running time it never gets boring. Great footage in the closing credits too, so keep watching!"
" Closed Minded people just won't get it.
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,9,"When you read the reviews on here, it's literally them complaining about the language, the message they were saying, it lacking and just hatred with rap music. Not stirring the political pot, right wings can have their voice but the left can't which is ridiculous. 1. The film depicts the reality of life on the streets so language is going to be strong (it is R rated), if that's a problem don't watch the movie. 2. They exercised their first amendment rights by speaking the truth about what's going on in areas that people don't frequent so it'll be a shock when viewing something that is new to you. 3. Too many people hate rap music for language, what they rap about, etc. Rap isn't for everyone but for those who can use it and channel their anger and express themselves, it gives way for some raw lyrics and great beats. But you can't go too hard or they'll get mad for speaking your mind in song. No one ever complains about all that Satanic rock music or rock music speaking about killing yourself and death but you hear the B word in a rap song and it's the end of the world. So in short, stop complaining about music you don't understand, and culture you choose not to associate with. Plenty of people of all color and background embrace rap music and this movie so what's the problem? I went and saw it amongst a mixed crowd and lot of men (white, Black, Hispanic) in their late 40's and early 50's watching it because the impact the group had on them which is powerful. Yes they left some things out, but what biopic is 100 percent accurate? The acting was on point especially O'Shea Jackson, Jr., Jason Mitchell and Corey Hawkins. So instead of bashing it because of language or what not, research the group and what the filmmakers captured instead of spewing your hate towards because you're offended. They didn't come together to make friends, they wanted to bring the reality or Hood and urban areas to the mainstream which still rings true today with police brutality and racism at an all time high."
" Fantastic film
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this thoroughly. A portrayal of a group of talented musicians describing life on the streets the only way they know how.The genius behind their lyrical minds was astonishing, writing from the unique perspective, breaking barriors, unnerving the establishment. Exactly the same way Punk Rock did 25yrs earlier."
" Hands down one of the best movies ever made!
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,10,"One of my favourute movies of all time, and one of the best biopics ever written, Straight Outta Compton is the birth of an iconic legacy that made the world explode into thrill-seeking hip-hop music that we love today.The movie firstly explores the true origins of one of the most beloved artists of all time, all their actors' portrayal knock off an act so beautifully, it details such a dazzling exploration of the real-life icons that made it to their success. From the rise to the hip-hop group N.W.A., to the fall of their band leader, Eazy-E, it surely brings it to a jam-rollercoaster, to an emotional level that becomes tearful, it shines a light on what REALLY happened to their lives that will never be forgotten. It really shows you the issues of Ice Cube leaving the band abs making his own Diss Track, and when Eazy-E's disagreement coming to see his illness. O'Shea Jackson, Jr knocks off a terrific performance of portaraying his real-life father and kicks off a new fresh turn of what he really experienced in the band. Corey Hawkins portrays the rap's doctor, who is now the owner of Apple's Dre beats, and the Jason Mitchell brings to life an artist that changed history until his faithful death. The movie makes it even better with unknown, fantastic new faces that portray one of the best artists ever: Snoop Dogg, 2Pac, and many more.The movie gives it all, and is one of the best biographical movies ever to be out on screen. GO AND WATCH THIS MOVIE! It will be a crime to miss it."
" A great movie very informative. Ignore the ones that are trash everyone is spamming.
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,8,"Me myself I don't really like rap or hip-hop. But it's nice to know what these men went through on the road to fame and success. Yeah it was a rocky road and they're not the best or Perfect People but they still are people who had real life stories to tell. No they're not my heroes, they are still people which perspective. I recommend this movie to anybody with an open mind who wants to see a portrayal of what it was like to grow up in this situation.Don't mind the one star ratings they're just spam"

" THE STRENGTH OF STREET KNOWLEDGE
",2018-04-29 00:00:00,10,"This film documents the history of N.W.A. (N-word With Attitude) from before its inception in 1986 up until the death of Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) of aids. We see them as kids who ""want the best for me"" and reject society. They consider themselves journalist because they report on what is going on outside their door, expressing frustration in explicit and provoking language known as ""gangsta rap"". The film covers the splitting up of the group, the highlights and the low-lights. O'Shea Jackson Jr. did an excellent job playing Ice Cube, most likely better than Ice Cube could have done himself, if you have ever seen him act. The film made me wonder who was the most Ruthless, the rappers, the police, or the record company. They could have named this film ""Ruthless."" This is the story behind the lyrics. It was well done, but may not be topical for a lot of viewers.Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity. Bye Felicia."
" THE ACCURATE REVIEW
",2018-04-19 00:00:00,10,"Dear loyal followers, Its time for an accurate, real and correct review of this off the scale 11/10 masterpiece. Lets start by analysing the techniques used to bring us this joyous, heartbreaking, emotionally warming and politically correct societal blockbuster hit. The use of actors was rather exciting, especially O'shea Jackson Jr playing the Angel of the lord himself - Ice Cube. Now many of you out there may criticise my beliefs and ideologies of how the genius Cube himself, is portrayed on his past experiences and work but not forgetting his colleagues who have made big success. Being a black man in the 80s was known to be quite traumatic and racist, so to see a group of young black rappers succeed was simply absurd but developed to be iconically phenomenal and game changing for the music industry as a whole. The music can I say made me feel quite peaceful and the classic hit '*UCK THA POLICE' is a song I listen to every morning for my daily meditation but also what I share with my clients to show them whatever you are going through is not that bad and it will be okay in the end. To all the haters out here I have one message 'go suck a duck', I shall change that word by simply replacing with a 'd', because most of you have 7pm bed curfews, and can not restrain from powerful language. This movie was beautifully crafted to reveal the true struggles of ethnic minorities. I will tell y'all a little secret, me and Ice go back a long way we have had our arguments over creative talent - ice always wins, which I think is fairly evident in this review of our lives. Now I have his digits on my cell, I won't hesitate to give him a call and arrange a little meet up with all you dictators. Cause Patricia B is crazy! Kind disregards Her Majesty Patricia Bateman Vanilla the 8thI gotta say it was a good day. P.s me and homeboy remember writing this back in 92' Peazy P outIts very hypocritical for this post to be declined multiple times due to other reviews being considered racist and patronising!"
" Fanatastic
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,10,Loved it. Always a fan of nwa back in the day and if you were then you'll love this movie.
" this movie is very good
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,10,This movie was excellent showing how LA treated African Amercians in the late 80s early 90s. i am a fan of political rap and this movie shows it. it not only shows the rise and fall of N.W.A but also what they had to go through to get to the top. i think straight outta compton came out in the right time with everything that happened between 2015 to 2016. it shined light and made everyone understand just a little bit. other than that the movie was excellent but i just had one problem with it. when N.W.A was recording straight outta compton Dr Dre went outside and was having baby mama trouble and then the cops drove by and looked out the window. After Dre's baby mama drove off the rest of nwa came out and asked what he did wrong and about 3 cop cars came from around the corner and harassed the group when everything was said and done cube comes up to Dre and thats how fuk da police came about. but thats not how the real story went
" Decent...
",2018-03-15 00:00:00,5,"A interesting look into the band and the many struggles it faced. However, it's debatable if the film is completely accurate or not. Has some good editing but not much unique cinematography, just rather conventional. The settings and lighting were very well done however; it has some very thoughtful locations that really add to the immersion. Some of the scenes are very well executed and extremely memorable. Most of the actors were quite good and look similar to the actual performers. The themes it focuses on were powerful and really added a deep layer to the film. However, the portrayal of women is awful. There are either completely objectified or absent through most of the film. It can be quite degrading watching how they are shown."
" Dee Barnes
",2018-03-12 00:00:00,1,"I would have given this film a better rating if the Dre/Dee Barnes incident had been included. Maybe a 6 for authenticity or something. I've been in South Central at midnight--and places in L.A. just as dangerous. So I've brushed shoulders with those who have been marginalized and have not looked to Jesus for their salvation but to drugs, sex, and money/power--all of which fail every one of us in the end. Anyway, this film should be Rated X even if for the one scene alone that shows actual cunnilingus and very possibly coitus, though the latter could have been simulated. But the Dee Barnes attack by Dr. Dre was never mentioned, and this is wrong. It should have been. It's an important part of the picture. Without it, the NWA crew are mostly made out to be good guys battling White America. But as rapper Sevin of HOGMOB so adroitly puts it, ""It's not a skin issue, it's a sin issue."""
" Good fun bio that takes it a little easy on Dre
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,7,"Dre and Ice cube are producers and so one can see the the way they whitewash certain aspects of their early lives. Having said that, the movie is done reasonably well. Ice Cube's son is pretty good casting as he resembles and sounds like his dad. The highlight of the movie is Jason Mitchell who is great as Easy E. JAson Mitchell deserved an acting nomination as he is one of our emerging great actors and has a very engaging screen presence as one can see in this movie and the TV series Chi. Paul Giamatti is good, but i wish they showed just a little more nuance in his shady character in the second half of the movie."
" What a great movie
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,10,A must watch for any rap/hip hop fan. Absolutely fantastic portrayals of the core five members of the band.
" You have got to be kidding.
",2018-01-20 00:00:00,8,"For all the people who wrote 1/10 reviews.
You have got to be kidding me.
There are so many people, who write uselessly negative reviews, and for what? Aggressive, throwing stuff like, I'd rate it negatively if I could, and such. Talking about the NWA like they are 5 happy misogynists, having sex all the time, depraved bums and are proud of it. Talking about them sinning and having sex all the time.
Listen to yourself.
This film shows the dark side of the 1990's. Look how people were treated back then. This film shows what shit people went through back then. This shows who they were. So what is they had sex. Look where they came from. This is trying to show how much of a shit-show America was back then. 
This film is trying to tell you about that.
The 80's and 90's weren't having a new brand systematically destroy America. America was destroying itself. These men were rappers. These men came from the streets. They grew up in a shit-show, and so they rap about it. They don't rap to prostitute their way to become millionaires. 
Look a little closer and stop focusing on all of the sex scenes for fucks sake. It's X-Rated, what do you expect?
It's the history of the NWA. Nothing is ever completely white and pure. 
For all of you that say that this film shows 5 misogynistic men, fucking their way through life and destroying America. These people were rascals, sure. These people were thugs sure. These people rapped about their troubles. 
For the people that rated 1/10.
You are very close minded, and are not aware of identities. Draw conclusions, not from the sex scenes and the swearing, but the story."
" Better than your average music biopic (but still a music biopic)
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,7,"Better than your average music biopic...but still a music biopic. The story felt uniquely relevant to 2015, partly because the director skillfully used police brutality, partly because the music felt fresh and partly because the performances were solid across the board. But the plot still felt scattered and long-ish; also, Easy E's coughing fits were representative of some TV movie tendencies (VH1 perhaps?). The film overcame those faults. But it was good, not great."
" The beginning of gangsta rap
",2017-10-28 00:00:00,8,"In F. Gary Gray's docudrama biopic, Straight Outta Compton, it tell's the story how six men from Compton, California (Eazy-E (singer), Ice Cube (songwriter, singer), Dr.Dre (DJ), DJ Yella (backup vocals), MC Ren (backup vocals), and The D.O.C. (backup vocals)) rose to fame their debuting album Straight Outta Compton by their band N.W.A. previously they all worked together on the hit- single Boyz In Da Hood by Eazy- E. After Boyz In Da Hood blow up, Eazy-E met with music manager Jerry Heller who was played by Paul Giamatti who I think did a great job playing the manager. Ice Cube's son O'Shea Jackson Jr. play's his father in the movie and does a good job at it acting like his old man and capturing his charm, eventually the manager Jerry doesn't pay Ice Cube the money he deserves and the legal representation to sign a record contract. So Cube leaves the group and start's his own music label and becomes a film actor starring in Boyz N the Hood and also becoming a film writer for the 1995 movie Friday and the film show's both these event's. Before Ice Cube splits the group their controversial song f the police show's the crew getting arrested and fighting for their freedom of speech. Leading to other rapper's basing their material to what N.W.A. did. Dr. Dre would leave and would discover Snoop Dogg, Tupac, 50 Cent, and Eminem which I personally loved how they introduced them. N.W.A. would now just be Eazy-E, MC Ren, and DJ Yella, Eazy-E now finally realizes that Jerry was screwing him over from the beginning and Dre and Cube were trying to tell him but he didn't listen, he tries to reunite N.W.A. without Jerry being involved which I think is pretty cool, he reconciles with Ice Cube and Dr. Dre but find's out he has HIV/AIDS dying shortly after he's diagnosed causing the group to grieve, but people will always remember him, finally Dr. Dre leaves Death Row Records because Suge Knight wasn't fair to him and starts his own label Aftermath which becomes very successful. The music for the movie was perfect, what wasn't was they never explained what happened to Jerry Heller after he was fired by Eazy-E. N.W.A. led a movement of modern day rap to let it be what it is, N.W.A. wasn't afraid to have changes in music which is what's great about the group."
" Pretty good but selective memory takes over
",2017-10-06 00:00:00,6,"Yes, the film is overlong but generally entertaining. Would have given it 7* but knocked off a star for the flagrant rewriting of history to favour the producers (Dr.Dre, Ice Cube and Tomica) Performances are generally good (esp. Ice Cube's son) Better editing and more honest portrayal of facts would have improved the film. Btw ignore the 1* reviews - don't watch a film about gangsta rap if it offends you so much!!"

I sure did and guess what? I'm not slinging dope or act disrespectful towards women. Some folks said the acting was horrible ... I disagree (Paul Giamatti as Heller, Cube's son playing his Dad, Jason Mitchell's portrayal of Eazy-E, and R. Marcos Taylor as Suge where on point to just name a few. Others claim the plot was weak ... or that it isn't based on the real facts. I just have to say A 2.5 hours are not enough to tell everything in 2 decades and B none of you were there ... so don't pretend you know anything. If you are outraged about the strong language or the nude scenes, go back to finding Nemo. And people quit bashing ... Try to write some positive reviews nobody cares why your feelings got hurt."

" Conflicted - Good movie but would Eric Wright wanted to be portrayed that way?
",2017-07-19 00:00:00,7,"As a movie, it's great. The casting was spot on and the actors are perfect. It keeps you on the age of your seat for the first 1hr 45 mins and then winds down from there. It has some humour in it and shows the human side of them all. They all have their flaws, but they have qualities that outweigh them. I loved this as a movie. 7 is a high score for me and I would have given this movie an 8 if not for the last hour of the movie. The portrayal of Eazy-E struggling seems very disrespectful to me. If Eric were alive, would he have wanted himself being portrayed that way? He had a good solo career, he was working closely with Bone Thugs n Harmony who were nowhere to be seen. It skipped his rap beef with Dre and his diss records to Death Row and Suge Knight. He even ends up bagging up cannabis to sell and make ends meet. It's very disrespectful to a man who isn't here to see that his legacy get's shown tastefully. He was a very proud man and would want to come across as stronger. When Future generations watch this movie they will think Eric was a struggling solo rapper who couldn't function without NWA. The truth is he wasn't doing too bad financially, he had a successful solo career that was only slowed down due to his deteriorating health, and was helping many up and coming artists. He was still being paid for every record Dre sent out for the time he was under contract with Ruthless.Despite it being a very good movie, it isn't the best biopic due to their portrayal of Eazy-E."
" Worth a watch but not too accurate
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,5,"All in all, the movie isn't so bad... Especially considering how awful some biopics are. However, I don't believe the film is very accurate. Now, before you go like ""What?! the films' producers are two of the main characters, of course it's damn accurate!"" to which I'll say: That exactly is the problem..."" Besides not including a pivotal member in the formation and release of NWA's first record and pretending he never existed (I'm referring to Arabian Prince here), the movie focuses too much on Dre and Ice Cube, since they're the two members that achieved the most fame as solo artists, and Eazy E of course, since 1- He's deceased and it's out of respect for his legacy, 2- His - controversial and not really liked- widow serves as a producer for the film also. The film really takes away the importance of DJ Yella and MC Ren and minimizes their roles in NWA to focus on Dre and Ice Cube probably because it was assumed that it'll attract the audience more as to this day these are two huge names in the hip hop world whilst DJ yella and MC Ren -despite being real OGs- aren't as known to the mainstream audiences. So, overlooking the fact that history is re-written, the cast does live up o the expectation, especially Ice Cube's son: He does a wonderful job portraying his father, so does Paul GIamatti as Jerry Heller. Some scenes are a little cliché (Ice cube listening to NWA dissing him and hopping in the studio to spit ""No Vaseline"" and NAW in turn listening to it sitting in Heller's office arguing if Ice Cube knows what anti-semitism is... -,-' ) Conclusion: it's worth a watch but to get the real NWA story and beefs, it's best to do some reading from around the web."
" One Of The Best Biopics
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,9,"Based on the true story of the rap group NWA (Niggaz With Attitude) that started in the 1980s and revolutionized rap, ""Straight Outta Compton"" is a mesmerizing movie that holds your attention with its brutal, gritty scenes, good acting, energetic concert sequences, and powerful, in your face music.O'Shea Jackson Jr., Corey Hawkins, and Jason Mitchell portray three of the NWA founding members, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, and Eazy-E, respectively. From the mean, gang infested streets of L.A., these young men will hone and use their talents to rise above the killing fields and forge a new path for rap that is still felt today. Brutal cops, vicious gangbangers, a sketchy manager (played by Paul Giamatti), jealousy and infighting among NWA members, and censorship will test the bonds the group members have. Some will get stronger, some will fall by the wayside; but their music lives on.My most memorable, movie moment is the scene when NWA is harassed by the LAPD just for standing around a building that houses a recording studio they are using. That harassment inspires Ice Cube to write the lyrics for the song ""Fuck Tha Police."" ""Straight Outta Compton"" is one of the best biopics to have come out in the past decade, filled with a raw energy that can suck you in even if you are not a fan of rap songs. And for those who do like rap, this movie will be much more enjoyable for you.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
" Awesome
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,10,"Being a huge NWA fan since year 10 in high school,now (29)this movie was a dream come true,about my favourite hip hop act of all time. The cast did a great job especially the actors playing the 3 main leads(DR.DRE,ICE CUBE,EAZY-E). The movie paces itself brilliantly and everyone is given ample screen time."
" Entertaining movie but not a great script
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,6,"I watched this movie because I wanted to know a little bit more about N.W.A and their history. After finishing the movie I can say I was pleased with the movie and had a good time while watching it but there is nothing really great about it.The performances are pretty good and everyone portrayed their character in a very good and realistic way. The way in which they incorporated the rap music was very good and the soundtrack is great of course.I have to say that the most interesting parts of the movie are the beginning and the middle. When we can see the whole group together and we see them do all kinds of crazy sh*t. In the third act of the film, you get what happens after N.W.A gets separated and everyone goes in their own path and it wasn't really that interesting. I really wasn't that invested in the story by the third act.I think that the main problem with the movie is the pacing and the story itself. The pacing is kinda off and sometimes you couldn't tell how much time had passed between different events. Also, the story does not lend itself to a very straight forward narrative. I think that they tried to cover a lot of events that happened and that led to damaging the story-line of beginning-middle-End.The problem is this: The beginning is the formation and rise to fame of N.W.A. The middle is the golden years of N.W.A and the album ""Straight outta Compton"". The end should be when Ice Cube leaves N.W.A and the whole group disintegrates, but they preferred to cover the story until the death of Eazy-E, which makes the third act feel like a whole different movie.Also, since the producers of this film are Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, they decided to take out a lot of events and things that they did in order to protect their status. I think it is okay to protect yourself if you are the producer, but because of that they kind of make themselves look wiser and on top of the situation when they really weren't.In the end, it is an OK movie. You can watch it and have a good time with it, but do not expect anything great."
" A great hip-hop biopic with quality acting and storytelling

" Great old Compton fun!
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,8,"Loved this movie from the start of it; by the fact, I listen to their music all the time. The time period that the film settles in works, the soundtrack is epic, the characters are great and the story was just top-notch and powering. Way better than ""Notorious"" and by far, the best movie I have ever seen in 2015!"
" Great film, worth more than 1* reviews the muppets on here keep grading it as...
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,8,"I'm only writing this as a kind of response to the outrageously low marks, and occasionally racist reviews. I know a little bit about the story, I followed this stuff when I was growing up. I was about 10 or 11 when I started to listen to rap music (I listen to ALL types of music not just rap! I have a very wide taste in music and a huge record/CD collection to back that up!)... OK, basically, I LOVED this film. I enjoyed how the story was told, all these crappy reviews on here are very suspicious indeed as some of them are virtually identical to each other! People moaning about the swearing? You've got to be f**king kidding me! People moaning about young angry black men being glamorised for their choices in life and how they act? F**k. Off. I don't see people slagging off mafia films like Goodfellas or Casino in the same way! And some people on here complaining about it being an 'Adult' movie!?! Swearing, sex, nudity, gang activities etc. Of COURSE it's and ADULT MOVIE! SO F**KING WHAT!? There's even some reviews bringing the good lard G- zuz into it! How? What the f**k does Jesus have to do with it?! Less Jesus, More G's, please!It's a film, it's Hollywood, even I expect errors in these biopics because of that! The acting was very good indeed I thought. Certainly no problem there. Some things were left out, but as I said, I kind of expect that from Hollywood.These 1 star reviews are suspicious cos they certainly don't reflect accurate feedback. If my mate, who didn't know who NWA were and has never ever listened to rap music, can become engrossed in this biopic, and actually say to me at the end ""Man, that was actually really good! I found that thoroughly enjoyable!"" We watched it late at night when he was dropping off to sleep. Instead, he got into it and woke up cos he was enjoying it so much... So, ultimately, I'm not going to say much about the film as there's no real point. It was just a reaction to the 1 star, bordering racist, filled with crappy personal irrelevant opinions reviews... Nuff said..."
" Emotional, entertaining, riveting.
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,10,"Wow, what a movie. Where to begin? So I saw highlights of this movie on HBO and what drew me in wasn't the actual backstory of N.W.A. but the soundtrack. I love music so that drew me in immediately, considering that I knew most of the songs. I don't know how true to life this movie is, but I was impressed with both Ice Cube's and Easy-E's character. This movie explains (to me anyway) why Ice Cube hardly ever smiles, and I had no idea he was a key contributor to N.W.A. Ice Cube was and still is a really talented dude. Same with Dre - his scratching - was amazing to watch. To be honest, this movie has some emotional elements to it, despite the Compton feel and hardcore background. I cried when Dre got the bad news and when Easy-E found out he had AIDS.It was a completely riveting movie and all the actors did a phenomenal job, especially Ice Cube's son. He pulled off his Dad perfectly!Great movie 10/10."
" Great Movie! Best in its kind!
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,10,"First of all, i must say, i really enjoyed this movie! I've been a fan of NWA since the early 2000's, i listened to all of their songs, watched all the interviews and documentaries. So, i wasn't a stranger to the plot, and most of the time the production stayed true to the real events i thought, except some part of the feud between the rappers. But i don't think anyone will watch the movie with a critic eye, everything was great.The actors did a really good job, huge thanks to the real characters who mentored them, and had a big part in the aspect of credibility. The Compton atmosphere was really old school too, and well synchronized with the music that was used. Really loved it, great acting, great directing, great production. Definitely worth it, and really loved it."
" It's enticing, invigorating, and a harsh mirror for the people that lived in the late 80's and early 90's, and today's people too...
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,8,"A lot of people are saying that this movie glamorizes the thug life, and it portrays the protagonists as heroes even though they're bad role models etcetera etcetera. The truth is, this movie is down right amazing. The plot, the casting, the producing, whatever, it's all good. Straight Outta Compton simply shows the struggle that the rap pioneers endured in their era. Racism was a big deal, and so was police brutality. The 80's and 90's had the same problems that we have today. that's why 'Fuck Tha Police' was so controversial. This movie is telling it how it is, or was. People are just mad because this movie shows the reality of America and its police. Alright, the movie is a little embellished. They exaggerated some of the events, and cut out others, but that doesn't change the struggle. That doesn't change that the police were dicks, and that doesn't change NWA's talent. Nobody likes to look in the mirror, and that is what this movie is; it is a mirror for white America."
" Fantastic movie, whether you're a fan of the music or not
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,9,"This is a movie which will grip you even if you're not a big fan of rap pioneers NWA, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Dogg. If you are a fan, you'll probably be in heaven. Either way, I highly recommend this movie, which has it all: great acting, a compelling story, riveting direction, and most importantly, honesty. It doesn't make excuses, but at the same time, you see the genesis for NWA's incendiary lyrics: blatant racism and brutality by the LAPD at the direction of Daryl Gates, vast economic disparity relative to other citizens of LA, and an environment of gang violence. Can you imagine being held at gunpoint by thugs entering your school bus because you had made a few gestures at them out your window? Being forced to the ground with hands behind your back by the police for no other reason than the color of your skin?You also see NWA's defense so eloquently put by Ice Cube (well, his son, O'Shea Jackson, Jr., who plays him brilliantly): they were simply reflecting their world, honestly, and were also protected by the First Amendment. There isn't a lot of visibility put into the misogynistic lyrics of the genre and these artists, but it is clear that they were young men acting out, and when we see the older Cube a family man, sagely reflecting back on a video he made was younger, we appreciate that. We tend to have barriers and stereotypes built up, demonizing others we don't understand particularly when they confront and challenge the status quo, and this movie really helps break those down. At the same time, the attitude and actions against women were the areas that I felt the artists got too much of a pass, and a perfectly honest movie would have included those elements.I liked seeing all of the personalities in what was a very special time in music history, similar to when McCartney met Lennon or Jagger met Richards. Fans of those bands, calm down, I'm not suggesting NWA reached the heights of the Beatles or Stones, but what an incredible influence they had on an entire genre from the crucible that was Compton in the 80's. You see the fiery lyrics of Ice Cube, the visionary genius of Dr. Dre, and the tragic story of Eazy-E. Corey Hawkins plays Dre and Jason Mitchell plays Eazy-E, and both are fantastic. You see great nuance in the character of the band's manager Paul Heller, played by Paul Giamatti, who advocates for them and advances them, but also ultimately screws them. You see the jealousies between the band members lead to a schism. You see Snoop Dogg (Keith Stanfield) arrive on the scene, and you see a real villain in Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor), who at first seems to be helping them get out of a situation in which they're being taken advantage of, but quickly does that himself, and in addition, exercise extreme violence in asserting his power. The quality of the acting is consistently high. The story itself is fascinating, and Director F. Gary Gray did a great job of figuring out what to leave in and what to leave out. Even though it's 147 minutes, which is long, you'll find it flies by and doesn't seem long, which is the sign of a great story-teller. It's quite surprising that none of these fine actors, the director, or the movie itself were even nominated for an Oscar, and quite right that that fact was widely protested. Definitely go see this movie."
