" Terrific
",2021-03-25 00:00:00,8,Hats off to the technical advisors and Director. This is a tight wonderfully edited film. The actors don't seem to be acting at all....sooo good. It's an action film but way more. Denis Villeneuve draws or allows these Actors to do their thing and they do. Pretty Great.
" Very good
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,9,"It's hard to top the intensity and tension of the whole sequence where they are driving through mexico, especially at the border."
" Super top movie
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,10,"My whole life I have been an amateur of good movies. A good plot, a solid story, a motivated director and the perfect cast... not so easy to come by.
This movie has it all. It takes yu on a super rollercoaster from the opening scene untill the atypic end.the best movie i've seen in a decade"
" Ppl gave it a 10 seriously??
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,5,"Acting was pretty bad from the main character, just weird overall. If you let her out of this movie you wouldnt notice.
Story is pretty simple, very little action.
If i knew before, i would pass this one..."
" Highly recommend
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,7,"Really beautiful movie
You will never get bored during any part of itGreat job"
" Nearly as good as it gets
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,9,"This is a truly brilliant film. Extremely well made, super tight production, great cast, and the direction could hardly be any better.The only issue I have with the movie is that the supposed moral compass that they tried to implant into the movie, in the figures of Kate and Reggie nearly brought the movie down. They represented the weak PC, fake moral puritanism that is making America such an incredibly weak nation.I can only hope that what is being portrayed in this movie is actually happening in real life, rather than the pathetic and horribly confused law and order, that the incredibly incompetent and pathetic FBI, and the ethically bankrupt DEA does on a daily basis. Not to mention the other agencies that pretent to ""protect"" us.Politics aside, a great effort and not a dull moment."
" Childish. For 11-year olds or Americans.
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,1,"Emily Blunt with her model looks is a super tough hero commander of a SWAT FBI unit. As she leads her men in a break-in a bad guy doesn't surrender, even though he has no escape route, but prepares to ambush her. Of course, she dodges the bullet and kills him with a single shot while falling because this is an American movie (Yawn). The house is full of bodies which the Mexican cartel, instead of disposing them in conventional ways, has buried standing up in various locations in the house. The bodies stay perfectly.vertical and do not crumple, but of course neother the director nor the average viewer of this flick is bothered by realism. The policemen trigger an explosion when they try to open a booby-trapped basement.
Why would the criminals booby-trap a place if they are not expecting a raid and are living there? Because in this kind of movie there has to be an explosion every two minutes. In short, the story is idiotic. Laughable. If you aren't from the two categories noted above, do yourself a favour and stay away from this rubbish."
" Great Story with stupid & useless characters
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,5,"Every actors in this film did an amazing performance with their characters, including Emily Blunt & Daniel Kaluuya. But their character did nothing to the story and useless. They look so stupid for FBI agents, in fact, worse then a normal cops we found on the road.Furthermore, there's some unnecessary scene also, like a scene at the cop house with his family.This film might get my 10 stars if they removed or replace that 2 stupid characters."
" just wow
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,10,The most realistic action movie I've ever seen. in general i hate action motives that in real life we cannot find such senses contained in the movies but this film you feel its action documentary some time it holds your breath.
" Blunt Weapon
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,6,"Emily Blunt remains whippet-thin and in top physical condition for her job as an elite SWAT agent on the frontline of the FBI's war on Coumbian drug barons despite her enjoyment of frequent beers and cigarettes in this efficient, glacial thriller. Lots of people die violently, yet after two hours you still don't feel much has actually happened."
" Let me be Blunt
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,5,"This film looked and sounded great.Intense, raw storytelling absolutely ruined by Emily Blunts character.Out of all the people to choose to join the team, why did they choose a stupid, emotional do-gooder.Blunts character added nothing to the story apart from moans and groans every time she made a ridiculous decision or spoke about procedure.Thanos and the Collector are brilliant in this. Each character is different but focused on what they need to do.In summation, this film could have been brilliant. There's a reason Blunts character isn't in the sequel."
" Exceptional
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,9,"On rewatch, this is still an exceptional film. What strikes most - apart from marvelling once again at Deakins' camera work - is the brevity of the film's key scenes; for all that they stick in the memory - and they really do - and for all that individual scenes and the film as a whole are all replete with tension and uncertainty - it races by. Not one scene is a moment longer than it needs to be, and the result is an unforgettable, coherent whole. Del Toro and Blunt are both outstanding, of course. I remember when we first saw this in the cinema my wife felt the ending let down the way the narrative is centred on a woman, forced as she is to compromise. For me, that remains an open question and one I haven't seen addressed elsewhere - but whatever the answer there, it's a remarkable film."
" Swung for the fences and came up short
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,7,"This movie has all the components that you would consider to be required to make a classic film. Great cast, well shot, good soundtrack etc.What it doesn't have is depth or a story that really goes anywhere. At the end of the film you are left kind of going 'oh'.It has a chance to grab you by the balls but fails to get a good grip!"
" In the beginning its brilliant. But......
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,5,It ultimately fails to consistently deliver. Its one of those movies that could have been so much more üëéüèº
" The excellent movie from Denis Villeneuve
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,9,The excellent movie from Denis Villeneuve. Despite a simple plot the movie surprises with the realism. The excellent movie about a drug mafia. Without the American pathos and patriotism. Just excellent history reflecting our real life.
" So dark but so good!
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,9,This movie is even better when you see this for the second time. It's so dark and the score is also great and dark.
" Really Good Thriller
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,9,"Everything that Evanoil says about this film is correct - it is an outstanding thriller. My only beef is the lead female character - Kate. She simply does not measure up to her new role in the 'new team' and this is at total variance with her supposedly great career in the police/FBI. She has no backbone and just does not get on board with the strategy being developed by the CIA.Apart from that, the film is excellent and I will recommend it to everyone. Fast-paced, intelligent, well-acted and it credits the viewer with some intelligence as well"
" Suspense delivered while showing an horrific war against the roughless cartel
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Del toro and brolin killed it in this thriller that keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat. I guess you need unorthodox measures in this unorthodox drug war and that is what this movie is all about. It might be confusing, harsh and unsatisfying at times but it's part of the deal. Please don't expect guns blazing, explosions and jumping of buildings like a cheap action movie. Appreciate the slower pace, the suspense it builds and the real life tactics this movie shows. I believe this is the fourth time I have watched it and i am still enjoying this master piece by dennis villeneuve. 10 out of 10 easy."
" Firmly settled
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,7,"Everyone act well, you just love 'Benicio Del Tora' what a cool & realistic actor, just love him, but Josh Brolin (matt) just over act , you never felt naturalistic about his acting."
" Incendiary filmmaking
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,10,"An all-encompassing firestorm of a thriller from one of the world's finest filmmakers. The set pieces are taut, thrilling affairs, particularly the jaunt into Juarez, which is one of the most breathtaking sequences of recent years. Adding to the film's tension is a soundtrack that seems to be perpetually building; a real pulsating beat. It should go without saying, but the cinematography is nothing short of masterful. Deakins really pulled out all the stops. I just can't find fault with this film, from the dramatic first fifteen minutes, until the satisfying climax, this is filmmaking how it should be done. Kudos to Villeneuve for the great direction and to Sheridan for his script. He's really maturing into one of the great American screenwriters."
" My all time favorite movie
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,10,"For me Villeneuve is the best regisseur out there. I love Prisoners, Arrival is one of the best movies I've ever seen and Sicario is for me the ""perfect"" film. I see no weaknesses in this movie."
" A Great Thriller
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,9,"A very deep and intense thriller. There are two aspects of the movie you need to know going in: 1) You are watching it in the perspective of Emily Blunt's character. Since her character gets left in the dark for three-fourths of the movie, so are you. 2) It is a movie that weighs how far are you willing to go to really make a change. When it comes to gang violence down at the border, by the book rules will not bring change, the question is how far are you willing to go to bring actual change. That is what Emily Blunt's character goes through.If you understand those two aspects of the movie you should love the movie. If you hate not knowing what is going on or have a weak stomach it is not for you. I think this movie is beautifully shot and tells a great story. The Writer and Director of this movie are responsible for some of my favorite movies, and they do an excellent job doing this one as well.93/100."
" A great movie. Until the end
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,5,"Yes this is a very well done movie. Even though there are only 2 likeable characters in the movie. And even then I feel like I want to kick their asses. But the ending just sucks. it really, really sucks. Mainly because it is very realistic. No, I don't want a sappy Hollywood, feel good ending. But having the 2 main, almost likeable, characters so thoroughly defeated is a draining experience. Maybe that's the point. To make the audience feel as defeated as the protagonists. But I didn't care for that. At all. It made me feel like I had wasted my time watching this movie."
" Amazing Thriller with Underwhelming Character Depth
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,8,"Sicario is an experience with a great score by Johann Johannsson and incredible cinematography by Roger Deakins. The movie sound and looks spectacular. It was a joy to watch this movie, I was never bored other than a few scenes in the middle. The thrill in this movie is one of the bests of the decade thanks to Denis Villeneuve. He handles the action perfectly by taking his time to build up the scenes. The action is very subtle whereas the build-up is carefully planned. Technically, this movie is a masterpiece. I can't say the same for the story though. Don't get me wrong, it is good but it mostly does nothing special. Emily Blunt portrays Kate Macer very well, but the source material is not good enough. She meanders throughout the movie, and yes in a way she is like the audience in the movie: Trying to understand what is going on. That's not a bad idea in general but her character is so centralized that we expect something from her. Instead her storyline becomes a mediocre one in the middle when she meets Ted played by Jon Bernthal. I feel like there is about a 20 minute part in the middle which can be cut easily so that the plot could move smoother and in addition we could have seen more of Del Toro's character so that the ""narrator"" shift wouldn't feel so rushed and unexpected. The other side characters are just there for the plot purposes and are very stereotypical. Nevertheless, Sicario is a great movie and a must watch for thriller fans."
" White knuckled ride from start to finish
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,9,This film kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. I found myself clenching my fists for a good portion of it.
" A Superb Modern Western
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,10,"This film dark, gritty, and suspenseful in all the right ways. Starring Emily Blunt (A Quiet Place) as an FBI agent thrust into the violent heart of the Mexican drug cartels by the by the strange, sandal wearing Graver played by Josh Brolin (No Country For Old Men). A secret operation into Mexico is being launched and being spearheaded by a quiet, well dressed man named Alejandro, this being Benicio del Toro. Blunt's character, FBI Agent Kate Mercer, just doesn't fully know what her role in this operation is nor the full extent either side will go to to win a seemingly never-ending war.Considered one of a trilogy of films written by the masterful Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone) that include Sicario, Hell or High Water, and Wind River this movie has all the hallmarks of his work. Long slow burns of tension and sudden explosions of indiscriminate violent separated only by vast, desolate and often hauntingly beautiful scenery. Honestly the score by Johann Johansson was itself almost an integral character in this film. Director Vilenueve uses all the stellar talents in this film flawlessly.
This is a movie that pulls no punches and therefore stays with you long after the credits have rolled. From numerous quotable scenes, the sweeping landscapes and outright brutality of certain moments this will be a standout for quite some time. Even compared to it's subpar sequel."
" Mess
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,1,Emily blunt was a total weak mess in this. She contributed nothing to this movie. I have no idea why her character was even there. Do they pay people to give c r a p movies a Hugh rating??
" Suspension, drama, guns... absolutely amazing movie
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,10,"A proper film. Beautifully executed. Throughly enjoyed it from start to finish, was on the edge of my seat."
" My favourite fiom of all time
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,10,"I would have given this film every Oscar, acting, directing, photography, editing and the music score is superb."
" So I can breathe now?
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,9,"Sicario is directed by Denis Villeneuve and follows Kate Macer. A by the book FBI agent, played by the amazing Emily Blunt as she gets recruited for a government task force to stop the war on drugs in the border between Mexico and the US. The cast includes heavy hitters Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin as part of the task force, as well as Daniel Kaluuya as Emily Blunt's partner. Denis Villeneuve's sharp direction paired with Roger Deakins's cinematography gives the film a dark, gritty, very real look and feel. A big part of what makes Sicario work besides the great performances, the direction, and cinematography is the suspenseful score by J√≥hann J√≥hannsson. Quoting Chris Stuckmann, ""the film is like a snake that weaves around you and squeezes the breath out of you."" Benicio Del Toro gives one of his best performances and so does Emily Blunt. Sicario is undoubtedly one of the best crime dramas of the 2010s."
" Great movie
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,7,Great movie. Entertaining and suspenseful. Not sure it has rewatch value though
" Massively overrated.
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,5,"Finally got around to watching this after buying it on a streaming service over a year ago and I am disappointed to say the least. I can see why critics loved it, because its the kind of slow moving horse manure they seem to get very excited about. Del Toro and Brolin put in good performances but Blunt's character is pointless and ultimately the biggest disappointment in the film. By all means watch it if you have absolutely nothing better to do and its free."
" Too long without necessity
",2020-09-08 00:00:00,4,"A slowly, boring and painful to watch movie. The idea is not bad but the development is just sooooo slowly you have to fight against yourself to not fall asleep. This could have been a great 90 minutes movie."
" It's just over there...
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,9,"My adult life was raised in Arizona, in the east valley. Miles away from us, 180 to be approximate, is the Sonoran desert. Less than 20 miles away is Chandler, where the film opens. I thought to myself, watching these opening moments, how close to home is this? How much do we really see about the Cartel, and never think ""That's happening just over there.""I continued watching, engaged in a morbid curiosity.Our perspective is granted by the protagonist Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), an experienced FBI agent who is attached to an extrajudicial CIA outfit lead by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), under the pretense of supporting them in El Paso. She boards a plane, learns that they're actually bound for Juarez, Mexico, and acquaints herself with Graver's mysterious companion, Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro).Throughout the course of the film, Macer is consistently faced with the fact that her morals and principals do not function in the Sonoran Desert. She tries her best to steel herself for every encounter between Graver's outfit and the Cartel, only to learn that she has waded into a riptide, and is swiftly losing the shoreline.By the end, Kate's only power move is to hold onto her principals. She insists going to talk about what the CIA did in Juarez. But Alejandro reminds her where she is, and who /he/ is, with a gun to her chin, and a strong encouragement to sign the NDA he's placed before her. She signs, and as Alejandro leaves, she goes to her balcony and draws a weapon on him. He welcomes whatever's next, but she relents. She holds onto her last principal, she regains control, and even though she lost the battle with Graver, she won the war for herself.--Overall, the film is an excellent fish-out-of-water tale with an underscore on human fragility. Every moment is caked in realism. Every character, one could assume, has a purpose until their purpose is used. 'Sicario' is a film that tells the viewer ""Nobody's bulletproof"", and delivers on that concept in spades.Denis Villenueve will always deliver as a director. The action in the film is as contained as the characters need it to be, and the mood of apprehension is pervasive, thanks in major part to the late J√≥hann J√≥hannsson's incredible score. Taylor Sheridan, as a writer, delivers an awareness to the human condition. Between all of them, 'Sicario' developed into a well-shot, well-acted exploration into what it feels like to be a sheep in the land of the wolves."
" Nice cinematography
",2020-09-01 00:00:00,8,If you like dead bodies and beautiful skies then this is the film for you.
" Watched it Five Times.
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,10,"This is one awesome picture. I come back to it with some gin and tonic. The action is live and alive. You can smell the towns and the cars and the bullets. It's that good. Acting, top notch, dialog is fast and true to form. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and hit play."
" Lah dee dah
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,6,"What an insanely overrated movie. Too bad, Villeneuve is usually a greta director, but this is just meh."
" It was a good movie, except for the protagonist.
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,4,"It's hard not to observe that the writer wants us to feel conflict and pity for Kate, the straight laced cop, but for an otherwise exceptional movie this character was just so poorly written inside and out. She's supposed to be this excellent super-cop, yet barely resembles one. She's supposed to be struggling to accept the ethical dilemma of questionable CIA activities, but it comes off as patent nativity to an absurd extreme. She cares too much about bureaucracy for someone who has watched the bad guys murder everyone around her for years.Don't get me wrong, the actress performed wonderfully and beautifully. Her script is just broken. Uncharacteristic of any police officer. Unbelievable of any regular human being. The viewer cannot connect with her.There's also a flaw near the beginning of the movie. A police officer is blown off his feet in an explosion. He flails his arms and legs wildly in front of him while flying backwards. In a real explosion, he would not have the strength to move his extremities against the force of the blast. I wish they'd stop wiggling so much."
" Sicario. (2015)
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,10,"Rousing and incredibly tightly staged thriller with outstanding actors, especially Emily Blunt, who in her role forms the moral anchor point for the audience, and Benicio del Toro, who takes on the multi-layered role of the antihero. With the help of a terrific soundtrack and great camera work, Denis Villeneuves tells a story that is bitter reality and leaves you wondering in the end."
" Nerve-racking
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,8,"I have to admit that this was one of the most tense and stressful movies I have ever seen. It is completly imposible to turn your head around because you are always waiting for something to happen. Like them, you feel that letting your guard down can have devastating consequences.The cinematography and sound edit are marvellous and key aspects that make this movie so immersive.Furthermore, Emilly Blunt's and Del Toro's performances are outstanding.The only possible downside is that it could have had more psychological development on the charaters because for example Kate's character is pretty straightforward and she doesn't undergo any major change during the movie despite everything she has been through."
" What the hell was that
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,2,"This could have been a good movie. It started well but quickly lost steam. Great cast, an important topic and a plot with potential for some serious drama. But (almost) everyone involved screwed up. And that is quite an accomplishment. The boring script just doesn't work and the directing by Denis Villeneuve does not even attempt to build up suspense. And that soundtrack. Like the noise from some old engine. Horrible. I don't understand the high ratings and share the views of every one and two star reviews."
" Great viewing
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,8,"Awesome entertainment & if you like this one you will love the sequel even more. I found Emily's character a little too over the top politically correct (just happened to be a woman... yep, you guessed it: against all bad men) I watched this movie again straight after watching the sequel & I must admit the sequel just ever so slightly wins for entertainment value. Now that is rare that a sequel is even good let alone awesome. Well done to the director & team for both"
" Tense intelligent filmmaking for 2010 decade
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,10,"If you desire a film to challenge your socio-political beliefs while delivering a powerfully presented message for the past decade, this is the film.This movie deals with how American security/LEO organizations are dealing with drug cartels in the present time frame. It's not a pretty or jingoistic presentation.Villanueve deftly gives the viewer all the particulars and let's the viewer draw their own conclusions given the story's background and present day situation. The movie explores the complexities that face the LEO and other government agencies trying to curb the multi-million dollar drug trade conducted in America from foreign actors. It's clear early on that the FBI is depicted as the naive child in this arrangement. CIA and other shadowy government officials are calling the shots.Once, the plot unfolds, the movie heads to its third act that really challenges the viewer's opinions how America should or should not be fighting the war against the drug traffickers. The acting, writing, directing are all outstanding. Of particular note, legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins is on the camera. This alone should drive any seasoned film buff to seek out this film.
Deakins' work is breathtaking to behold. If you love political action thrillers check this one out..."
" Very well shot. You get frustrated until a point of realization
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,9,"Great shooting. Brilliant colors.You are following this adventure of the drug war in Mexico and how the US is fighting back.Except, the protagonist makes you mad. Then you figure out that character is not the lead, and the real lead is understated. That moment is when the film goes from mildly annoying to brilliant."
" I never give a film a perfect score
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,10,"It's all there on the screen; great casting, direction, cinematography, editing, soundtrack................ The film has a persistent menace that gets under your skin. It is an intense experience. Casting Blunt was a stroke of genius. She seems so unlikely! The film avoids all the pitfalls of heavy macho cliches to present a truly gritty vision. Great filmmaking."
" Violence Drama Cartel Movie

",2020-06-12 00:00:00,10,"This is a movie where you won't be able to pause or take your eyes of the screen. It's what a crime thriller should be like, with nothing but good acting and beautiful camera work."
" Good as expected
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,7,"When I start to watch this movie i didn't expect a full feature action and I expect this movie
All casts done well..From director to actors and miscellaneous.
I also love Emily Blunt for her great acting.
but some flaws irritated me. first the pace of the movie was too slow for me and the second one was that I think exaggeration makes a movie out of mind.
overall i like it. (not love it)"
" Tense and beautifully shot.
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,9,"This film is intense. It's a simple concept that does not follow the cliche plot lines of the genre it's in. Sicario is unpredictable and dark. Something you could see taking place in the real world.Roger Deakins is the cinematographer for this film. He lives up to his name, once again, and gives us a beautiful movie to look at. Some of the shots are breathtaking.The acting is also top notch. Emily Blunt, now perhaps my favorite actress, is flawless in this film and gives us a great character to see the story through. However, Del Toro is the star of the show...he is badass and nailed every scene he is in; definitely the most fascinating character in the movie.Sicario is yet another great movie from Denis. He is one of the most talented directors working today and this film illustrates that fact."

",2020-05-17 00:00:00,7,"Due stupid circumstances I watched the second Sicario first which I found stunning. So here in the first one I do get to know what and who and why but it's a complete different flic then the second one.Here it's more blah blah and action and blah blah and action, but still it isn't that bad after all. It's not your usual mob flick. It's not a typical Hollywood flick, it urely is worth watching and do so so you can see entry number 2 which is more brutal and full of action.

" Really good, brutal and phenomenal 7/10
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,7,"Emily Blunt is great, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro are fantastic. The whole story is really creative and original. The characters are great and how they act is real. You can maybe agree with there actions or you can disagree, have common thoughts. It doesn't seem like there is a main bad guy in the film. It's just the ""good guys"" with mixed thoughts on what they are doing."
" Three of the greatest of the greats.
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,10,"I've seen thousands of films, long have lost even rough count of the books I've read. I see the best films more than once, the very best three or more times, the ones that improve with each viewing. Seen Sicario five times. It's one of the greats. And I'll watch it again, because so far it has not only been better every time, but breathtaking every time. Primarily, I attribute this phenomenon to one of the greatest performances of all time, by Emily Blunt in the lead role, around which everything revolves. Two of the greatest of the greats: this film and Blunt's performance.But everyone in this film comes through, in every performance and technical role. And that is due to the direction by Denis Villeneuve, who is among the greatest of the great directors of all time. I have not heard of a great film offered in the English language that I have not seen, and I have never seen a better film than this."
" Yes please
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,10,"We need a third one ASAP simple as that. This is one of the best modern military films, so well directed, acted and written."
" Wonderful
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,8,"For two hours, sicario, a thriller about a drug cartel, gripped the audience's throats. From the gender of the main character to its ambiguous theme of morality, the film constantly breaks through the constraints of genre films. In a rare combination of the serious themes of a mainstream drama and the sheer entertainment of a torture cell film, and with one of the best cast combinations, the film doesn't mess around at all."
" Fast and full of energy but missing a lot of points
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,6,"Sicario is a fast thriller pumped with a lot of energy. Makes the viewer sitting glued to her spot. Felt very realistic, as if I was right there, the lack of music in many parts only increased this feeling. I saw people complaining of the movie having no ""main story"" but I think this was its strength, getting an insight into a 2 w mission, not too dramatic, not too boring, it felt like a documentary turned movie and definitely got your heart rate up.
On the other hand there was a lot of  turndowns; especially Kate's character which is described as a green, sentimental, newbie. They could easily have chosen a man for that role but why bother? Additionally her partner is the only coloured in the movie and sadly he has to play a side role and chauffeur (even though he is a lawyer!). It's tiresome to see those patterns repeat themselves in movie directing and too realistic to turn the blind eye to."
" Much ambition, little substance
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,5,"It is done with great ambition and a big budget. But, it has very little to show for it.Yes, some of the scenes are very well done. They may not look beautiful, because they are not meant to be, but, they have an effect. The aerial views of the wastelands and poor cities of Mexico, the sequence in the underground tunnel... Well done and impactful, but, nothing really special, it's been done before.It does feature decent pefromances by the main actors, but, not nearly as much as hyped. Emily Blunt is not very good, really. Sure, her character is highly implausible, she's tough and strong and emotional and indecisive and butch and feminine... it's almost impossible to play well. Still, she's not doing almost any of that believably. Del Toro is OK, but, he's just ""doing his thing"", we see very little glimpse of his torment for the loss of his wife and daughter. Sure, by that time, he might have pushed it back in his mind, but, then he wouldn't still be on the revenge path with such passion. Brolin is mostly faking it. The only one to do a really good job is Victor Garber, whose ""I just work in this government agency"" routine is spot on, it was like looking at one of those people.The story is pretty weak and without much sense or impact. Things just happen and are tragic, but, it's way too unrealistic to pass as a kind of ""scripted documentary"", so the lack of sense or conclusion makes it pretty much pointless. Sure, we know that drug cartels, Mexican in particular, are very violent and that CIA and such are essentially ""playing along"" and it makes sense to point this out to those that actually don't know this. But, to have that impact, movie had to be very different. It also doesn't work as the story about Del Toro's character (which the title implies), he's too little in the story.So, if you like violent thrillers that have some loose sense of reality or correlation to real-world events that also look well done, this is a movie for you. Otherwise, pass."
" Close to Perfect
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,9,"While the cinematographic beauty or the great score are nothing we haven't learned to expect from Villeneuve, what really stands out here is the incredibly well made and tense action sequences.Villeneuve takes a story that could easily have been borrowed from a cheap action flick and makes a cinematic masterpiece out of it, a meticulously paced tense slow burner, showing us the face of the drug war more up close and personal than the photography would have you expect."
" Fantastic movie
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,10,"Great plot, great acting, great score, great action. Tense, edgy, totally captivating. Watch it"
" A B-movie in A-movie dress
",2020-03-21 00:00:00,6,"Featuring tough-as-nails C.I.A. agents freelancing in the drugs trade, 'Sicaro' follows a fairly well-worn path. Nonetheless, I quite enjoyed it's first half, with its disorienting but realistic feel. Further on, however, the plot goes downhill, starting with a hook-up that goes implausibly wrong, and ending with a deeply unconvincing conclusion. In between, the movie swaps protagonists, and abandons Emily Blunt's heroine to show the vigilante-style antics of another character, even though until this point the central mystery of the film was that she (but also us, the viewers) didn't know what to make of him. The film's final scene affects to show real concern for those who live in northern Mexico under the rule of the drugs barons; unfortunately, there's a B-movie not too far behind this superficially serious portrait of their reign."
" So Close, but No Cigar
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,9,"I'm watching Sicario now for the umpteenth time as I'm on lock-down due to the coronavirus (all bars are closed and football is postponed-what do you do with yourself in Spain without these options?). I haven't reviewed it before so that motivates me to watch it again carefully. This was almost an excellent film. It's about 80% excellent, and very close to one of the best in this genre. One of the obstacles keeping it from being excellent was Emily Blunt and her character, equal parts of both.What the film does well, it does very well. It starts off with a real bang. The opening minutes a very compelling, and then the story segues into a complicated and interesting story. The action is soon ramped up to the highest level with the scene crossing into Mexico, a scene filled with foreboding and tension until the climax.""Why are we going?""
""Because CIA can't operate within U.S. borders without a domestic agency attached.""This brief exchange is why the movie is good but falls short of great. Had her character not been the protagonist, had some other person been picked for this honor, the film would have been outstanding. The director was a little too intent on pointing out the moral ambiguities in the drug war and ended up erroring on the side of confusing and boring.Instead of highlighting Emily Blunt's character, imagine a lot more time devoted to that of Benicio del Toro. Alejandro had so much more at stake in this war than she. I would have loved to see his back story, the loss of his family. This was something that also could have been covered in the dreadful sequel to this film."
" Suspense without over-doing
",2020-03-10 00:00:00,8,"I love this type of movie. Short bursts of action intertwined with long episodes of ""nothing happens"" where everythinh actually happens"
" Fantastic, dark, slick, action thriller
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,10,"Sicario breaks the mould of the sterotypical action movie, yet still has great action sequences intertwined with a great storyline. It displays the contrast between good and evil and also the people inbetween those two worlds. You have idealist Emily Blunt who wants to bring down the Mexican Cartels, but inbetween all that is the likes of Josh Brolin's and Benicio Del Toro's characters. The film is tense and stylish, soundtrack is eerie. It shows a dark side to law enforcement and the questionable things that are required to be done for the right reasons. It reflects the world as a whole in some respects, that some things are never as they appear. Another great film by Dennis Villeneuve. Just a shame they tried to make a sequel."
" Good at the beginning, then it just gets boring
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,5,"I'd say the first half of the movie was very intriguing, but after that it just drags and I wanted the movie to end so badly. The problem with the movie is that it's too slow paced and can make you feel uninterested during parts of the movie. I thought that the action scenes were okay, but I wanted to see more action from the last scene where they go into the tunnel. Overall, for me the movie is just too slow which can easily make you uninterested."
" One of the best crafted cartel thrillers ( American A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,10,"Found this movie more exciting than expected. enjoyed how complex each character was. Lots of moral grey areas that were highlighted , Closer to the underbelly of reality than one thinks, watching it just like a movie. These are not far fetched from the real, which is even worse. Nicely made. Not noisy but still intense."
" I don't really want to think about it, but maybe we do need some of that ""diversity"" stuff
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,5,"I went into ""Sicario"" with really high expectations and left feeling quite disappointed. Perhaps this movie has just aged really rapidly, as movies often do.I won't be writing any spoilers, but we all know that this film is based on the on-going ""Great Mexican-American Drug War"". Emily Blunt plays an FBI agent and the other Americans are a bunch of shady operatives. I'm an aging (God it hurts to admit that) American male and naturally drawn to action movies, although they're the minority of films I watch.This film starts off under a steady rain of testosterone, which keeps building steadily throughout the movie, until it's a straight-up Category 5 hurricane by the end. Basically, it's about hard men in a hard world. Playing on that theme, I expect that copies this movie are being peddled in the back of men's magazines alongside ""pheromones"" and ""natural Viagra"". Way before it ended, I was overdosing. (Maybe I'm just too virile as it is and simply couldn't take any more hits, at least not without an opportunity to work it out of my system winning the Tour de France or becoming a home run king.) At least ""Mission Impossible"" flicks aren't intended to be serious commentaries on society.Emily Blunt's character was a joke. I'm not that big a guy and not in the best shape of my life, but unless she's some kind of black belt, I'd rip her limb-from-limb. Playing an up-and-coming, hard-core, door-breaking, FBI agent just seemed ridiculous and there was no way to suspend disbelief on this matter. Mostly she came across as a whiny, 90 pound, teenage girl. This isn't misogyny, only the hurtful truth. Total miscasting.Still, this film's testosterone overload makes a pretty good case for all those annoying diversity activists (should have more particularly mentioned that I'm a white male--the worst kind). Quite reasonably, most of us probably don't want the anti-heroes of ""Sicario"" solving the world's problems. I'm pretty certain that these ""Ultimate Men"" could do no better than another ""Ultimate Solution"", a bit of history best not repeated. Guys like these are the ""Typhoid Marys"" of PTSD. It's like when you elect a psychopath as President--the President's just fine, it's everybody else who suffers. I never thought that I'd ever find myself using that abhorrent, simple-minded, put-down ""toxic"" masculinity, but I'd consider making an exception here. Even the bits of supposed nuance in this film hit you over the head like a 20 pound sledge hammer.In the end, I'm still giving ""Sicario"" 5 stars, because, at least if you're a guy, it'll almost certainly hold you attention all the way to the end. Shamefully, it did for me. Also it's a very slick production. I remain personally very disappointed though, since so many reviews implied that the plot had depth. I suppose if you're extremely unfortunate you can drown in a wading pool, but it's still not the deep end, even if you can't swim and it's really windy."
" Sicario
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,10,"Sicario was first released back in 2015. I just watched it for the first time last week...and I really have no excuse other than I'm an idiot. I knew I'd like it, I'd heard nothing but amazing things, and five minutes into the movie I completely regretted not watching it sooner. Sicario is, hands down, one of the best action/thrillers of the decade. Director Denis Villeneuve manages to create so much suspense and intensity throughout 120 minutes that at times it's almost unbearable. Needless to say, my fingernails did not survive this movie. The plot itself is fairly basic - the FBI teams up with some shady people to fight a brutal Mexican drug cartel. Emily Blunt plays the young FBI agent recruited into the fight, and for most of the movie the audience is just as confused and suspicious as she is. It delivers plenty of wonderful ""what the hell?"" moments, as you never really get a sense of anyone's true motivations until the end. The performances are universally terrific and the dialogue is sharp, but the main reason the movie works so masterfully is Villeneuve. With the help of some striking cinematography and a brilliant score, he gives us one of the most surprising, tense, and atmospheric thrillers in the history of the genre. If you've never seen Sicario, please don't make my mistake and see it ASAP."
" One of the best action movies of all time
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,10,Without a doubt this movie will stand the test of time as one of the best action movies.
" Quite dynamic, thriller-like and drama-like
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,9,"After watching it, I was left wondering, but not for long. I wasn't blown away, let's say (that's why 9 stars). If you want to understand politics and politicians, this is the right film; even though, none appear in it. This is how I see it. Excellent acting, script and music.. And not predictable."
" Not worth watching if you're looking for something good...
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,5,"Look, if you're into basic cop shows then maybe this is for you... otherwise this is NOT worth your time. A few interesting scenes but an overall waste of time. Might be good to put on if you want an easy watch. If you want a really enjoyable, good movie, it's not this.."
" Could be great but the protagonist is boring af
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,6,"Quite exciting movie, after the first 15 minutes I thought it's gonne be great. I thought the protagonist would develop and play an important role in killing the boss. But then she acted all scared and anti - DEA. So I thought she would do something against the DEA guys. So yeah, I was dissapointed when the movie was over and she did - well, nothing really. Still quite entertaining because of those narcos vibes, a lot of blood and money, and the story of the guy seeking revenge was quite exciting."
" Realistic but too many lengths
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,6,"As the title perfectly sums it up.I liked the very realistic side of the film: both in the actions of the characters, and in the often subjective way of filming, which gives us the impression of being part of the action.
Del Toro plays a dark role that fits him like a glove.Only one downside to ""heroin"" (the girl, not the drugs... :D) a little too ""teddy bear"" for my taste.
I find it hard to find credible that a SWAT team leader can still believe in Santa Claus and imagine that we're stopping and fighting a Mexican drug cartel scourge by the usual little legal procedures, filing files in court and pleading to a bar association...
And who, in his immense sense of infallible justice, persists and signs (or precisely would refrain from signing, even under the threat of a revolver under his chin) to think that one should stick to procedure, even after having seen all the ruthless methods that are the law in ""this universe""?
Mouais, and the marmot puts the chocolate in the tinfoil.But what bothered me the most was the multiple lengths.
However, it started off pretty strong with this SWAT arrest scene.
The tension comes down perfectly afterwards, as if to let the spectator and the characters breathe, who evacuate the tension of what they have just experienced.
And then after about a third of the film... It gets too much... you get bored with each one of these scenes that go on and on...
Any of them? Never mind. But then I come out with the feeling that it was always an exchange between a bit of action, and length... a bit of action... and length.... length... etc... etc....Several tens of seconds and almost ten different shots to film the desert seen from the sky from a jet in flight ... Is it really useful or was it to fill a lack of elements to hold a ""conventional"" film length?
Ditto with the surveillance camera images, before stopping a smuggler...Anyway, it's a pity.
It doesn't have to be a big fart to make a dynamic movie, but here, the overall action seems a bit too limited in favor of images and scenes not necessarily useful to the story, and, what's more, boring.To sum up, I liked the film, no doubt, but I was a bit disappointed by so many unjustified lengths in my opinion"
" Harsh reality handled beautifully
",2020-01-16 00:00:00,10,"Of all the things this movie is, it is first and foremost honest.
Yeah we want Emily Blunt to kick doors down, shoot the bad guys, and overpower any of the men who consistently overpower her. However, the female FBI operative who is new to the drug war and constantly in the dark about what is going on cannot do any of those things and is forced to submit time and time again as the strong exploit the weak.
Set against the backdrop of the Mexican drug war but not about it, Sicario asks how far you would go to actually make a difference, and what it would take to push you further. Emily Blunt time and time again makes the right and good decision, and then gets shot, abused, or otherwise traumatized with no payoff. Real life is much like this: despite a hero's or-in this case-heroine's best efforts, the strong often just take what they want.
Backed by beautiful cinematography and a constant tension from the heartbeat-like soundtrack and personal camera work, Sicario weaves complex themes together into an intense yet digestible movie."
" Confusion confusion everywhere
",2020-01-10 00:00:00,5,"The key element of the movie is the viewpoint of someone, who is confused by all the things happening around her. However, it leaves the viewer confused too. If you're living on an other continent, and not involved in the US- Mexican situation deeply, then you have to do a lot of reading, to understand the motives and the main plot. The story would be great, if the creators had given the viewers enough clue to understand it."
" Good but flawed on one major point
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,6,"I was blown away with the cinematography, soundtrack, acting of Del Toro and Brolin. And I was very entertained. Great premise, only spoiled by Blunt's character.
Don't get me wrong, I love a strong female lead, and the part was well acted, just not well written. Here's my issue.
Blunt is hired after being a presumably superb firearms/Swat cop after narrowly being shot and taking out a cartel member and discovering a grisly scene of 45 cartel victims secreted in a house, which is booby trapped.
She is then hand picked, interviewed, and accepts the job, knowing they're going for cartel members. Massively dangerous job. That, in fact, is why she accepts.
Why then, does she (and her male colleague) then behave like a naiive primary school teacher?
Why, when on a top secret mission, does she choose to go out, go to a redneck bar and pull some random guy? (who proves to be her would be assassin?) Why does she pull a gun on del Toro and punch Brolin?
I understand the need for some conflict of character between Del Toro at one extreme, and her, but it was like she just didn't get it one bit, even after, about a third of the way in, Brolin and Del Toro literally SPELL IT OUT to her about why she's there. Yet, she carries on with the mission, and still whines about why she's there.
When she was in the tunnel, and her head hit the ceiling, so she takes off the helmet and draws a sidearm when she can hear raging automatic fire? Come on. I know we don't have to be ultra realistic, but from a highly trained firearms officer?
Maybe the director should have shown a character arc. For example, Blunt ends up on the final mission with Del Toro and SHE ends up killing the cartel boss and his family. Now that would really give her and us something to think about. Disappointed, because this could have been amazing with some character progression. Won't be watching it again."
" Once again, toxic reviews strike again
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,10,"If you wanna write a bad review maybe write more good reviews for other films so we readers know what movies you think are good. I hate it when people write only ONE bad review, and it's also disappointing to find people writing good reviews for the marvel movies and bad reviews for great works of art like, Sicario."
" It all fits together to make for a fabulous movie
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,9,"What makes a movie great? It is that I don't think it's a movie. This feels real. it doesn't moralize, everything appears to be in its correct place and I was disappointed that it ended too soon. I just wanted it to go on and on. I could never tire of this even though I've only seen it once. Meaning that I only like to see a movie once then move on. But I know I could see this again and would still be glued to back of my seat in awe of what is unfolding before me."
" If you like blackhawk helicopters and humvees
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,10,"If you like blackhawk helicopters and humvees this movie is for you.
Some ego but not the tank factor seen in some movies like Sniper.
Sicario is well done.
If you dont like Blackhawk helicopters, this movie is not for you"
" If you like helicopters and humvees
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,10,"If you like helicopters, SUVs and Humvees, this show is for you.
While some military movies go all wankee, this show pulls off ego and gives a realistic feel while giving a great storyline.
Those that dont like Humvees will down rate this show but if you like helicopters, this movie is done well.
The background music really adds to the feel."

" sicario
",2019-12-15 00:00:00,8,"Sicario is another hit from villenueve who did maybe the best cartel based film i ever saw,it has intersting start that gets follow up by great but dark story from both sides,in some moments even for me some parts with its themes were sick and disgusting but that just shows in what kind of world we are living it,expecely considering del toro character who was absolutly shady but at same times fun to watch and exploring his way in all of this,only part with blunt character and her partner were overshadowed and the most of their screentime werent so good as other ones"
" Excellent cinematography papers over the cracks
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,7,"This film is undoubtedly beautiful to look at, there has clearly been a lot of care and thought put into framing each scene, with tremendous results. Unfortunately despite excellent performances from the leads neither is enough to paper over some of the plot holes which undermine and other wise excellent movie."
" A disservice to everyone.
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,5,"Emily Blunt and Daniel Kaluuya delivered the most boring, uninterested delivery I have ever seen in a movie as theatrical as Sicario.Beautifully crafted set pieces throughout the movie keep the tension at a steady level where you always need to be on your toes as an audience member. You never knew what Del Toro and Brolin were planning.Brolin and Del Toros characters were completely captivating throughout the entire movie.Then Emily and Daniel show up to kill the mood.First, Emily Blunt was done a humongous disservice by this film. Her character is quite literally *walk here, complain, get owned*It happens over and over and over again. Her character was poorly written, and is almost so naive it is sickening.
First thing she does of any importance is accidently get and murdered by her Hitman, her Sicario. She is saved by none other than Benicio Del Toro. Then she holds a gun on Del Toro later in the next seen from the tunnel and is surprised when she gets shot at by a Columbian cartel lone wolf Hitman. She knew he was a Hitman and still decided to go through with this plan.Next scene, she hit Josh Brolin in the face and then her supporting actor Daniel Kaluuya heroically comes to the rescue as they pick a fight with several spec ops soldiers. He gets owned. That's his role. Don't see him again. He is a taxi service, then he complains, walks somewhere, complains, gets owned.Emily blunt in the last scene after standing by all her morals the entire movie, instead of accepting death like the stoic female lead she is, she caves and signs the paper saying that everything she saw was done by the book.To cap it all off, she decided once again to rush to the balcony and point a gun at Del Toro. Again.The reason I'm giving a 5/10 is because of Blunt and Kaluuya are detractors to the entire flow of the film. If it we're just Brolin and Del Toro 9/10."
" Benicio sold the movie
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,8,"As much as Emily Blunt was focused in on this movie for the first half of the movie, the twist of Del Toro's character was what sold the film with Blunt's character falling flat in the third act."
" amazing
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,9,This film is amazing loved it emily blunt rocks so does benicio del toro and josh brolin the film is dark and moody in places and sometime hard to watch but it is worth it i give this movie a 9
" Non-stop
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,9,Couldn't take pause. This is a straight watcher and you can't take your eyes from the tv. Better of the two sicarios. Emily Blunt plays perfect as always.
" Action packed yet slow enough to keep you imvolved
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,10,When I saw trailer before in theaters I was super stoked . When I finally saw the film i was mot let down and was actually one of those rare films that was better then in trailer. I wish I could say Josh Brolan or Banicio carry the film but Miss Emily Blunt fights very well in the ring. Just incredible film.
" Meh
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,6,Not buying Emily Blunt as a tough guy.She's got too much of that Engish-Rose thing going on.
" Tense, Dark, and Gritty
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,8,"Found this movie more exciting than expected.Moved a bit slow but enjoyed how complex each character was. Lots of moral grey areas that were highlighted. Yet, found Emily Blunt's character annoying and felt like she was dragged on like a sandbag throughout most of the movie.3.5/5. Did enjoy how this movie expand a lot on Mexican narco culture, yet felt as if there was lots of fluff that slowed the story."
" Denis, Deakins, Blunt, Benicio, Brolin.
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,8,"And each reigns in their own way. One of the few thrillers in recent memory that does not drag, does not quiver, and firmly pulls the trigger only when needed. Blunt turns out one of the best performances of her eclectic career, with her go-getting, no-nonsense, (and frankly, blunt) character who ends up near-buried under the enmity of the Mexican drug war. Denis Villeneuve does not shy from showing the seemingly sempiternal rough edges of this world, highlighted exquisitely by a tracking shot through the Ju√°rez slums, and a following scene at the border crossing which rivals the tension in the opening of ""Inglorious Basterds"" and ""No Country for Old Men""'s coin toss. Deakins produces the best shots of the year, and Del Toro's frightening Alejandro steals the scene on several occasions. Much praise has to be placed on the writer, Taylor Sheridan, as scripting something original that is both taut and question-raising is certainly little seen nowadays. An excellent film."
" Dark, effective thriller
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,8,"Emily Blunt is Kate Macer, an FBI agent who volunteers for an interagency operation designed to bring down the head of a vicious Mexican cartel only to find that the rules by which her new colleagues play are very different than hers. The story is brutal, gripping' and plausible (by movie standards) although there are a few unnecessary coincidences that should have been written out or set up better (despite their efficiency and resources, the cartel heavies don't seem very well prepared at times) and the premise that a document signed at gunpoint would have any merit in an investigation seems ludicrous (of course, if the signer was then 'found dead of suicide', the document would carry more weight - an alternative outcome to the scene that (IMHO) would have been shockingly awesome). The cast is good, especially Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin but I found Blunt's character to be oddly peripheral to the story and not all that interesting. The cinematography is excellent and the action sequences gripping, all back-dropped by an excellent, tension-building score. Nice work by director Denis Villeneuve."
" Haunting thriller
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,10,Excellent acting and relationships between the characters. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
" The Sicario of Denis Villeneuve retains the mystery.
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,7,"The Sicario of Denis Villeneuve retains the mystery. While not necessarily sprinting in at almost 2 hours, Sicario manages to maintain interest in what comes down in the final. In spite of the fact that the film tones and slows down after its intense introduction and first act, the story pushes to its conclusion. The work of the camera and the visuals selected help to animate what would be a very monotonous and laborious setting. The action keeps the film from becoming a bore, although not in gigantic bundles. While Emily Blunt takes the lead and delivers the most emotion throughout the picture, the more intriguing character Benicio Del Toro finds himself.Not much to argue with Josh Brolin completing the remaining major characters. Sicario lives up to his title as an action thriller. Run for the frontier."
" Nice acting and directing, but ultra poor (politically correct?) story.
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,5,"The acting was good, the cinematography was good, action scenes were good, music was outstanding, but the story was just meh.Why is Kate (Emily Blunt), an FBI agent, so damn worried about some text book rules? Do they carry out operations completely legally? The whole highway scene was intense, but Kate's reaction ruined it. What were they supposed to do when thugs are about to shoot them? Keep idle because it's illegal to retaliate in foreign soil?Me, who is a foreigner as far as US or Mexico is concerned can see the faults in Kate's character. It doesn't take much to figure out that one needs to bend the rules to get things done. Josh Brolin's character did what needs to be done, and all Kate could have done, if she wanted to help serve her country was to be just a mute witness to the proceedings. But she was all concerned about the legality of the procedures.I don't know, maybe this movie is targeted to those people who are too much into some human rights thing or something. They'll talk about drug dealers and terrorists having to be put through legal trial just to show that the country runs according to some humanitarian rules.They should've gotten rid of Kate and just went about showing us how they deal with the drug problem."
" Not that great
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,5,"Sicario has some decent action sequences (especially in the last third) and an effectively intimidating performance by Benicio Del Toro, but these positives are outweighed by a pretty dull (and at times, hard-to-follow) script and a somewhat cardboard protagonist in Emily Blunt.She broods, cries and pouts a lot for most of the movie, and ultimately doesn't do very much. Unless they lowered the bar in a misguided attempt to achieve gender parity at the FBI, it's very difficult to accept her as an elite agent... she's no J Lo in Out Of Sight, that's for sure.I really don't have much more to add. With a more proactive lead, and a lot more of the excitement we got in the final reel, perhaps I could recommend Sicario. But the amount of chaff you have to sit through to get to the good stuff, it simply ain't worth it. File under 'Could Do Better'. 5/10"
" I don't know what the director wanted to show!
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,1,"Look, I have watched as many drug, gangster, ops movies to comment worthily that this movie falls into no class. It keeps you waiting and waiting without giving you what's going on. The director raised the tension from the very beginning, but disappointed the viewer by leaving them blank, without a clue. Music seems to be very tension-raising... but no points to be tensed about. Screenplay tries to allude so much that it misses the main point right away. Nothing's clarified. Not a clue. You remain clueless till the end. Equations doesn't hold.
Could have been a masterpiece, however."
" Devastating thriller
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,9,"A masterclass thriller, from the opening sequence to the incredible closing scenes, it never misses a bit. Believable characters which you care about are brilliantly acted, including the support roles. The action is first rate, very realistically done, and in perfect balance with the rest of the storytelling. The story, which is about vengeance and ethics in the ""war on drugs"" is interesting, as are the human and societal themes it raises. Pace and tension throughout is just right. Filming is superb and naturally done, with some great aerial and landscape shots, and the score and sound work excellent. The movie is serious, exciting and emotionally engaging, whilst avoiding any hackneyed devices or cliches. Absolutely engaging and superb."
" Wow
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,10,"Really good movie which will keep you entertained, lots of action and a must watch"
" Law and morality: not a coincidence
",2019-09-15 00:00:00,8,"While a lot of action/war/thriller movies are produced in stereotypical and commercial ways, ""Sicario"" manages to mix action entertainment with a real psychological detecting. The difference between two kind of police agent groups, that have to work together, bring the the relation between them to fight against law or moral sense. The main protagonist is a woman that thinks police as an activity all based on the respect of laws: attending this different group for a mission in a cruel Mexico, she discovers the fact that other policemen acts for justice but often using their ways, destroying strict rules or also mixing job with personal revenge. The evolution of Blunt's character is all played inside this space of not coincidence between law and morality, and the difficult to understand what is really good to do. The movie passes in a series of cigarettes and psychological problems, without a univocal solution."
" Outstanding film about revealing the perils of na√Øvet√©.
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,10,"Kate Macer is such a square peg in a round hole in this movie that I refer to her as Doink the clown, who was a wrestler. She falls on her ass about a half a dozen times in this movie, once while wrestling a a corrupt cop. She has no idea what it takes to catch the bad guys who are constantly winning the drug wars. Great photography, a compelling score and a standout performance by Benicio Del Toro make this one of the best films of the decade."
" Real and Powerful
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,7,"Shockingly real and raw and filled with beautiful shots. Sicario is a beautifully done film. My issue personally with the film is that I didn't feel like there was much of a climax, and I also feel like Kate doesn't do much during the film."
" If you ever had apprehension about going to Mexico

",2019-07-18 00:00:00,10,"Flawless movie really whether you consider the tight script, control and depth of characters throughout, and absolutely stunning cinematography ... I think the musical score is also incredibly terrifying and deeply adds to the film. At the end, you are left asking a thousand questions and thats the hallmark of a good film."
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,6,Good movie with great directing and awesome cinematography. Great acting and some intense scenes. A few very creative scenes as well. lost a little bit of impact the second time around. and it is a little slow at times (2 viewings)
" Presentation elevates the material
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,8,"Another example of a movie with average characters, story and depth. But it comes of as so suspenseful, so well acted, so fantastically scored and so beautifully filmed, that I'd call it a pretty great movie."
" BEST !!!
",2019-05-31 00:00:00,8,Sicario is everything and more you could want in a thriller bringing realism and gritty action sequences into a marvel of twists and turns all while shedding light on the changing and complex climate of the southern border
" Tense and Gritty
",2019-05-23 00:00:00,10,"I'm convinced that Denis Villeneuve can't make a bad movie. The man is a genius, and this film is a perfect showcase of his talents. The film is slow and methodical, building tension and dread as it moves towards its disturbing finale. This is perhaps the best drug trafficking movie since ""Traffic"" (2000), which, coincidentally, Benicio Del Toro won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. ""Sicario"" is a ruthless, violent, and grim thriller that is crafted with such skill and precision that it's darn near impossible to look away. Some people I've talked to complain about the pacing of this movie, or the way that the action scenes aren't actiony enough for them. I urge those people to watch this again. Subtle dialogue, incredible direction and acting, and a disturbingly dark ending make for one of the most taught thrillers I've seen in years."
" Really good!!

" ""We'll do anything to get the result we want.""
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,9,"Wow. From the very first scene, this film is intense and it only builds from there. The more you learn, the more exciting the plot twists become until you're left with the logical conclusion.
Kind of like a Mexican drug cartel version of ""Zero Dark Thirty"", ""Sicario"" takes you on a thrilling ride that says ""we'll do anything to get the result we want."""
" Extremely tense and entertaining !!!!!

" The Hard-Hit Thriller
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,8,"Sicario blends a neo-western with a cop thriller to package this hard-hitting story and commentary on border control, military politics, and the war on drugs. The movie allows the viewer to witness the border wars without censorship and Hollywood tropes getting in the way."
" One of the Best movie of 2015
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Keeps you locked in, can watch multiple times and not be bored. Definitely recommend to watch this with grownups family members. Definitely exited for the next one."
" After much hype, left bitterly disappointed
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,6,"Sicario was billed to me as a great movie to watch.
I was expecting something along the lines of Crash, silence of the lambs mexican style or essentially a confronting movie with blood, gore, police fights and telling chases.Instead were left with a slow plot instead.The start of the movie delivered exactly what I expected. A confronting Gang hiding people in walls and life being cheap. Perfect, we see clearly why Emily would go on a mission south. Now we find Emily and a Mexican police escort posse 15 cars long go into the dangerous zone with corpses hanging by the side of the road warding them off. Good start.Then the traffic jam! wow this convoy is stuck in traffic and they see 2 gang cars in the distance also stuck in traffic. How convenient, so they wonder over, gang cars pull guns on them, get shot and they get a crumb of information.... right I bought that plot leap!Now we have this 'shock' that US agencies go across the border to arrest and torture bad guys who appear to be quite bad. No redeeming features of them, just gang thugs being pushed to confess. Emily and her partner push to their boss wanting more details and answers...flagging their procedural concerns there. It's illuminating but sicario fails to ramp up the tension. It's officers asking their boss ""are we ok to do this""...""yes"".
It doesn't bring out the objections clear enough. The biggest problem being the FBI involved are 'in the dark', not the torture nor their reaction to the torture.So Emily gets drunk, her partner introduces her to a ""good man"" they get it on. When she realises he was carrying a bank note wrap identical to the wrap used in this mornings bust at the bank. After playing an almost helpless white female, a man comes to her rescue and gets this corrupt cop off her.Again how convenient. Lets just have a QF make another plot leap. Now they interrogate the corrupt cop and find out the location of the other corrupt cops. The only redeeming factor here is the corrupt cop being told that it's his family in protective custody or their addresses posted on Reddit.Then there is the tunnel scene which is meant to impress us with IR technology. Emily confronts Del Toro after he finds another corrupt cop ""silvio"" loading money in the trunk. Emily goes to stop him and Del Toro shoots her in her armor.
Del toro then proceeds to use the corrupt cop to get into the gang mansion and kill everyone there. Including the gang leaders family as they sit to eat a meal. It is 100% unclear if Emily knows any of this or if Del Toro is just immune to bullets.Also this is the death of Silvio, the father of the mexican kid playing soccer. the Kid being bossed around to get his bratty father stuff while he lives the life of the family father god. I had no idea why this was added. You make a heartfelt father and kill him I would understand as this provides connection to the brown people being blown apart, tortured and killed during the movie. You make a flawed and real father then you get a real connection. Instead you have made a demanding father that does nothing with his kid who the kid feels ambivalent about his passing in circumstances unknown. what was the point!The real crunch, Del toro this assassin is the one who confronts Emily to fill in the paperwork greenlighting the whole operation and to say it followed procedure. Right, your assassin paid to take out another drug cartel is the one ensuring the paperwork is signed! After wanting to see this for a few years and hearing a lot of hype, this is a fizza."
" Brilliant cinematography and dark realism
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,7,"Sicario is an enigma: some of the film is near perfect (notably the border crossing scene), striking the right balance of tension and drama, without losing realism. The portrayal of cartel-controlled Mexico is bleak and unforgiving, creating an appropriate sense of paranoia and isolating the American soldiers sent across the border. Unfortunately, between these scenes, there is a lack of meaningful storyline - Emily Blunt's character seems miscast, constantly unaware of the situation. Whilst (to an extent) this makes sense, as the film progresses this begins to drag somewhat.The real character of interest is undoubtedly the understated mercenary Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), someone connected to the cartels but with his own personal stake in the matter; his introduction scene (involving some suggested torture) is darkly realistic, and his motives remain a mystery until the very end. This, however, is part of the issue with Sicario - the ""take down the drugs trade from the inside"" plot device feels unimportant until you realise the underlying goal of the mission, preventing this film from really exceeding expectations. Whilst no doubt interesting, not engaging with the story makes enjoying Sicario more difficult than necessary."
" Emily Blunt character is useless
",2019-04-18 00:00:00,4,The Emily Blunt character is useless to this movie.
" Such an overwhelming film experience
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,9,"Sicario Directed by Denis Villeneuve contains such a compelling story along side incredible performances. This film takes you on a journey from the perspective of Emily Blunt's character. You think and feel as she would during some of the most uneasy situations I've experienced in a film. For the entire runtime, I felt consistently torn between characters I could trust and those who where manipulators. This is a film which plays with your emotions, and leaves you feeling on edge consistently. When the credits rolled I honestly felt dirty, due to the gritty visuals and blurring of morals. This tone was all successfully achieved from Denis' amazing direction combined with Roger Deakins' stunning cinematography. The beautiful natural shots with no artificial lighting, captures the most realistic darkness I've seen in film. Also Emily Blunt's performance was phenomenal. Her exhaustion, confusion, frustration and intense trauma was portrayed with such realism, that I genuinely forgot she was acting. Sicario was such an overwhelming film experience, containing such incredible filmmaking. So therefore I give It a 9."
" Watch once if you're into this Genre
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,5,"Found it long winded, average acting, crappy unrealistic plot, sets and scenery poor, soundtrack ""Rubbish"". Gets a 5 because it's my favourite genre but will be decades before I would want to re watch."
" Snooze-fest
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,2,"So, I watched Sicario yesterday. I had two friends suggest this movie to me. Also the good rating on imdb and a very good cast made me decide to watch it. The movie is 2 hours long and not only did it feel like 4 hours but especially in the first 55 minutes you have absolutely NO IDEA what the hell is going on! And even after you get some explanation, it still doesn't seem enough. I found myself feeling frustrated many times and I was just hoping for something interesting to happen. The only good things about it, are some drone shots and that's about it. It feels like half the time you just see people driving from one place to another or near the end just walk in pitch black for 10 minutes! We learn about Emily Blunt's role in the operation after 80 minutes have gone by! They only needed her because she was a domestic agent and not because of her skills. Even that revelation doesn't force any change to her character which is ridiculous. Also, some scenes went on for much longer than they should have. The only interesting scene is the one where Alejandro enters the Cartel bosses mansion and kills everyone. That's it! Emily Blunt's character is beyond boring and she is supposed to be the protagonist. Actually none of the characters are likable and the movie fails to make you care for any of them. At some point I was actually hoping for everyone to die so that this travesty would end sooner. The final scene is as anti-climactic as it gets... The fact that this has a 7.6 rating in imdb is beyond me! Total snooze-fest! I had already downloaded the sequel, but after that steaming pile of garbage I had just watched, deleting it immediately was the right thing to do..."
" Great potential, bad execution...
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,7,"One of the best thrillers in 2015, that's for sure. The only thing that REALLY bothers me about this movie, are the characters of Kate and Reggie. It feels like they're transported to this movie from some mushy drama and they don't fit at all! What is the point of these two characters in this movie? If they weren't included, I'd easily give this movie 10 stars, but since they are here, and their presence and mushiness can't be ignored, I have to lower my rating and give it 7 stars"
" Technically an exellent movie,very suspensul and interesting
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,7,"This is a very unique movie,fotography is on spot,as the audio,which make the movie catchy since the beginning;
But as the movie goes explosions and gunshot are replaced with suspensful silence,whitch is the real core of the movie;
Benicio del Toro nails the part,but Emily Blunt and Josh Brolin are really good too.Worth to watch it in blu-ray"
" One of the movies I would take to the desert island
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,10,"I think that like all great movies you have to watch this one more than once. Besides the topic being actual, I like the acting both of Benicio del Toro and Emily Blunt, and they match perfectly.
Del Toro is perfect to show the conflict arising from him being lawyer and officer in the same person. Blunt starts as an agent with clear certainties and ending with existential doubts.
This is the message of the movie about drug war: there is no good or bad, it is just a dirty war.
It is probably this ambiguity disappointing many (action) fans, despite the many brilliant scenes in breathtaking ambiances. No answers at the end, more questions instead."
" Very good film
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,8,"Tension, great acting, convincing story. No stupid superheroes, no unnecessary CGI, believable action and no cheesy music.Someone has just reviewed this with a '1' and I'm starting to realise that film/movie reviews are valueless as half of them are wrong - the challenge is working out which half.I think the answer is that 50% of the reviews are 7-8 or above then you can safely ignore all the negative reviews as they are inept."
" Junk
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,1,"Nothing happens.

" VERY REALISTIC AND DAUNTING.
",2019-02-26 00:00:00,7,"This 2015 thriller is one of the most realistic movies i have seen ever! The only problem with the film is that its slightly slow paced and dreary but manages to disturb you revealing underlying evil in the mexican underworld theres not a scene in this movie thats going to make you smile its very grim and thought provoking with a subplot that leads to a memorable ending , emily blunt is sexy and engaging and puts in a very good believable performance and benicio del toro - well, WOW ! he is brilliant in this. 7/10"
" Disjointed narrative but interesting cinematography
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,4,"Emily Blunt plays Kate, a honest agent who mingles with the wrong law enforcement crowd. The first scene establishes Kate as a brave cop, but it is a totally gratuitous plunge into a horror movie and unnecessary to the main plot.The main plot being Kate joining a motley crew of macho men, travelling to Mexico for a suspicious operation. Among the crew is strong, silent Del Toro as Alejandro. Being a foreigner, his presence as a ""consultant"" sounds fishy from the start.After the extraction and torture of a Mexican cartel member and several lies later, we finally discover that Alejandro was indeed a disreputable character and that Kate is in the wrong line of business.Most memorable is the scene in the tunnel, with an unusual but captivating cinematography. Overall, the plot is fairly predictable, with the expected statement about the West being the father of all evils - just before being shot, the Mexican drug lord tells his killer that it was the Americans who taught him his methods...Whatever the story may be, looks like there are plenty of non-Westerns who are willing to learn and even surpass their alleged masters in cruelty and cunning. Perhaps it's time they should start taking their own responsibilities."
" Devil in the Details
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,10,"CONTROL. COMPROMISE. VENGEANCE.I would credit Sicario as being one of the movies responsible for my deeply-rooted respect and admiration for the medium of film. Directed by Denis Villeneuve and acting as writer Taylor Sheridan's induction into the screenwriting business, Sicario is a tense, thought-provoking thriller that sets the audience on edge and keeps them there until the end credits begin to roll. With each re-watching of the film, one comes to appreciate Villeneuve's moviemaking on a deeper level and the faint subtleties he slips into every scene to enhance the film as a whole. The story follows FBI Agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) as she volunteers for a joint government task force to help bring down the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel. Heading up the task force is DOD ""Adviser"" Matt Graves (Josh Brolin), a lifelong soldier hellbent on bringing down yet another threat to his country. Acting as Graves' shadow is the mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) a seemingly reserved man of few words. Agent Macer is thrown into the world of espionage and operations that don't technically exist with both feet, serving as a conduit for the audience who have also never been privy to such things. Villeneuve takes advantage of everything from lighting to wardrobe to help subconsciously tell Sheridan's story. From lighting certain characters so that they faces are in light while others are in darkness to the last scene of the film where Macer is wearing a pure white shirt in contrast to Alejandro's dark suit the director used every opportunity to compare and contrast the characters. Emily Blunt plays Kate perfectly, a by-the-book FBI Agent thrust into a world of wolves that has no ruling law. Macer is understandably upset and thrown off balance by the constantly shifting ground beneath her feet and the audience sees the toll it takes upon the character from the dark circles beneath her eyes and picking her smoking habit up again. Both Graves and Alejandro have lived in the world of shadows for so long that they too are shadows and we see two sides of the coin in their handling of the horrors they've seen and/or perpetrated. Although the movie follows the plot through Kate's perspective, it is Benicio Del Toro's performance as Alejandro that steals the show. Taking over every scene that he is in with his intense, silent demeanor, Alejandro carries himself like a predator, always ready to pounce should the situation call for him to. Graves on the other hand, deals with the dark madness around him through humor, smiling and laughing as though he doesn't have a care in the world when in reality, lying just beneath the surface, is a predator waiting to take down its prey. Throughout the film, the musical score by J√≥hann J√≥hannsson enhances every emotion felt in each scene. With a steady heartbeat of drums and deep thrums of string instruments, J√≥hannsson raises the tension level and sets those watching on edge as they wait to see what happens next. Each character comes into the plot with their own objectives and motivations, Kate desires to strike a blow at the cartels killing innocent people, Graves perceives a threat to the United States of America and is willing to do anything and everything to protect his country, and Alejandro wishes to avenge the deaths of his wife and daughter who were brutally slaughtered by the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel. Every step taken leading the climax of the film takes the audience down farther and farther down the very dark, malicious rabbit hole that is the drug trade. This film shows every aspect of how the destructive disease infects and destroys all those it touches and how the United States is searching for the vaccine. Villeneuve and Sheridan craft a masterful tale of the chaos that reigns along America's southern border and all of those it affects, showing that in the face of lawless chaos and evil intentions, one must fight fire with fire or be turned to ash."
" Very confusing and unlikable characters make this a terrible movie
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,2,"We were waiting and waiting for something interesting to happen, and it never does. Boring, with fake drama and senseless shooting to fill the time.
Emily Blunt is wasted as she could've been replaced with a nobody here. In the end, this is just another revenge story. I recommend you avoid this gratuitous violence movie."
" Too murderous and poor acting
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,1,"If you like child killing, death, and poor continuity and acting, then this is the movie for you! Too violent. Bad."
" Drug Cartel Movie at it's Best
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,8,"Now, a 10/10 movie is superb, perfect filmmaking for me. I give a lot of 7s and 8s, but for a film to be a 9, it must have something great about it.And so I present to you Sicario. There is something very grotesque and disturbingly mysterious about the Mexican drug cartels and the killing that ensues. Americans need their illegal drugs, and Mexicans are more than happy to make a quick buck. But how they use that money and flaunt it through such a detrimental earning method, is very scary.Sicario presents the scenario from the cops as well as the cartel insiders. Benicia Del Toro is fantastic, and Josh Brolin plays the cool US cop guy very well. I have never been a fan of Emily Blunt, but she did her job in this film.I highly, highly recommend watching this movie. It may be moreso that I am a fan of drug cartel movies, but this is definitely a must watch.9 stars"
" Blunt and del Toro
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,9,"In my opinion Emily Blunt¬¥s character is vital to the movie. Anyone who criticizes her being ""fake"" is wrong. She brings the necessary human point of view to the proceedings and is a person you can relate to. Without her this movie would be rather uninteresting.Benicio of course owns the movie. The script, principal photography, direction and score by Johanssen are perfect. My only gripe concerns the lack of ""soul"", which is rather common with technically brilliant movies and directors - say Christopher Nolan and Stanley Kubrick for instance. That is perhaps the only thing that hinders Sicario from entering the club of truly classic crime films like The French Connection and L.A Confidential."
" Masterclass in how to create suspense
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,8,"Sicario is a cineast's dream: great plot, spot-on acting, razor-sharp editing, and an absolutely epic score. What I love most about Villeneuve's style is that he allows shots to ""breathe"", giving the viewer enough time for the beautiful compositions to soak in.Sicario is quite violent and will surely keep you at the edge of your seat, but it also has depth, both in terms of having interesting characters, as well as in terms of the commentary it makes about the politics of drug wars and border control.All in all, Sicario is a masterpiece."
" Eventually A Penetrating Look At The Dark Side
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,"13 May 2016. With strong elements from Traffic (2000) in which Benecio Del Toro won a best support actor Oscar and again gets to star in Sicario in a somewhat different role, Emily Blunt becomes our eyes and ears in this dark criminal drama. There are some great intense scenes that the audience participants in as observers to the efforts to make a difference in the war on drugs. Sicario has taken some hard-hitting actions scenes from Phillip Noyce's Clear and Present Danger (1994), Tony Scott's Spy Game (2001), and even Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker (2008).There are some weaknesses that appear in this movie. Emily Blunt's character without any character development seems to lack the depth of character to establish her persona and role that she presents on the screen. By the end of the movie, though, it becomes quite clear that even without Blunt's depth of character and backstory how the painful moral dilemma arose and becomes a sharp dagger against some's throat. There is a lack of balance between the American and Mexican characters, especially the important role of the Mexican police officer that is highlighted in the movie. There is also some fine landscape photography, especially of a jet taking off, but missing a similar opportunity to experience the wondrous sensation of its landing too. Finally, the mainstream photography of a high quality production seems to actually diminish the raw, jagged hard edge of the undertone of the movie.Even so, this movie as a whole is reflects a good attempt at pushing the envelope in quality, innovative ways of transporting the audience into the war zone of America's drug war."
" So so
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,6,"Yeah, this is a good flick. But extremely overrated. Frankly, a little too campy towards the end. Ultimately this film was hurt by trying to cater to a mainstream audience when the subject matter needs to be raw."
" Solid picture
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Tense, well-acted, and beautifully shot. I didn't think Emily Blunt had the chops for this role but she changed my mind."
" Very Compelling

" A Beacon if light in the storm of darkness that covers our world
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,9,"Outside of it being a total revenge story, Josh Brolins character was a true hero and Emily Blunts character was not. Anyone with a drop of common sense floating around in the mud puddle of their minds has to realise the inky way to combat darkness is to engage it with a greater force of darkness."

",2018-12-18 00:00:00,7,"Many of you might think, oh no, another drug dealing movie about what is going on at the border between the USA and Mexico... and yes, you are right, this is another movie about what is happening but we don't want to know is happening day after day... but let me tell you something, the movie is really catchy and why is that? Well besides how it has been filmed there something different from the others movie: the main character is a woman.Emily's Blunt character is what makes this movie terrifyingly real and to gain our attention among all the movies from the same topic. She is the newcomer in a land of men, as one might say. she is coming from the bureau where everything follows some rules and there is the law. Here she has to learn to not follow said rules and even forget about the law. Time to sort of one priorities.The plot itself is nothing out of the ordinary but it is the actors' work that make this movie one movie to remember (or not to forget). It is really an entertaining movie that gets your attention with what is happening and with its reality that not many other movies can comply. Really worth your time.Review written: 19/10/2015"
" RUBBISH
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,1,"My so called mate told me to watch this movie claiming it was action packed, however once i slapped it on my plasma screen i thought very different. it was extremely boring and i prayed they did not make a sequel. 3 years later this nightmare came true and i am now on the way to my mates house to bust him a new one"
" A beautiful and tense movie
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,7,"This review contains spoilers.Sicario is an action thriller film that premiered in 2015. The movie is directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro, and Josh Brolin. The movie follows Kate Macer played by Emily Blunt that discovers cartel activity in a FBI raid. Kate and her partner join a task force that seeks to bring the cartel to justice.Denis Villeneuve should be commended for his great directing. This direction is one of the movies biggest strengths as the entire movie is pretty to watch. Every scene sets up the stakes well and also the intention of every scene is crystal clear. This movie has gorgeous panoramic vistas and overhead shots. There is a night vision and thermal scene that simply is cool to experience.The action in the action scenes are not the complete focus in Sicario. This movie prefers to set up the plot of the movie and prioritize that for its action set pieces. This is absolutely worth the build-up as it makes the action scenes and the effects of it more satisfying. One of the examples in this movie is when the tunnel is raided. The tunnel being raided is both a cool scene to watch as well as leading to the finale that built up Alejandro. The movie is riddled with examples like this that make the movie more exciting to watch.All of the actors do a great performance in this movie Emily Blunt's Kate Macer is a naive Federal Bureau of Investigation agent in the world of the Mexican drug cartel. Kate is more of the audience's character than a character that is meant to be mysterious. The characters that take the show are Benicio del Toro's Alejandro and Josh Brolin's Matt Graver. These two character's experience in the world of the Mexican cartels is evident. The movie's secret protagonist is Benicio del Toro's Alejandro. This character undergoes his own personal story that both Kate Macer and the audience experiences.There are some aspects of the movie that are meandering without much point. One of these is the plot with Mexican police officer Silvio. This plot got pointless and did not connect with the main story well. The story was already understood to impact many civilian lives. When Silvio runs into Alejandro the result is already clear. The entire setup was not worth the result.I would recommend Sicario. The movie is a tight action thriller.Grade: B"
" Sicario is stressful - very, very stressful.
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,8,"Sicario is stressful - very, very stressful. And the scariest thing is that this film doesn't seem too far detached from reality. Emily Blunt gives a powerful and emotional performance, and Benicio Del Toro is mesmerizing as the mysterious Alejandro. This is not a movie that I can pop in anytime and enjoy, but it is a well-crafted piece of cinema."
" Worth A Watch
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,9,"For me, this movie is near perfection. The ambiance of the cinematography paired with the nerve rattling score make this movie experience intense. Josh Brolin and Batman Benecio Del Toro provide a good cop bad cop performance rivaling any I have seen. The audience takes the vantage point of Emily Blunt in this movie while she provides an incredible performance almost mimicking the audiences reactions to the scenes unfolding. The story reveals itself in a unique way in that the true nature of what is happening is not revealed until near the end and the ride getting there was a journey itself. I recommend this movie to any cinephile, fans of Brolin, Del Toro, Blunt and/or Denis. V. and fans of crime and/or mystery films."
" Darkness alert!
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,8,"Sicario is directed by Denis Villeneuve, written by Taylor Sheridan and starring Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro.In the lawless border area stretching between the U.S. and Mexico, an idealistic FBI agent is enlisted by an elite government task force official to aid in the escalating war against drugs. Led by an enigmatic consultant with a questionable past , the team sets out on a clandestine journey forcing Kate to question everything that she believes in order to survive.A great fast-paced, dark and powerful story, with an amazing direction adding some very talented cast, but with a couple of flaws, this is how Sicario was born.Let's jump to the flaws.. Emily Blunt's character wasn't so necessary, she had no goal but just going with the waves of this movie, but with her amazing performance, she convinced me -or I pretended being convinced- that her goal is cleaning the world of it's dark crimes, but for me, it's uneven.Some scenes were so confusing, and there was nothing to give any hope, it's just dark.. from the beginning to the very very end!These are the flaws of this movie, everything else was well made.. the breathtaking scenes mixed with amazing performances with great story.Sicario is a great movie, and I'm gonna give it an A-.Alright, next one is Sicario: Day of the Soldado, stick around. And thanks for reading my review, wish you like it."
" Refreshing.
",2018-11-09 00:00:00,9,Enjoyed the film from start to finish. Like others reviewers have said films like this don't come out that often these days and this Sicario is very welcome.
" Hitman
",2018-11-09 00:00:00,9,"A movie which will penetrate deep within and make you think. Not your typical FBI movie, it is clean and to the point. The direction seemed brilliant and Emily Blunt being the main lead still isn't the protagonist. I might have guessed the twist right from the beginning but that doesn't take away from how brilliant the movie really is. Restore the control !!!"
" You-get-it-hard Movie
",2018-11-09 00:00:00,9,"This is the movie I watched second time. I guess the first time was hasty and thus could not concentrate on what it meant to me!Now I understand it very well that the FBI agent Kate (Emily Blunt) and her Partner Reggie actually led a successful drive against Mexican drug cartel and reached a safehouse and rescued the corpses standing in the wall even of two police officers. She finished the mission successfully even killing some other enemies and this brought her focus in the nation.Next, a taskforce was initiated where she was attached as part of the mission. However, the planner Matt and the Hitman (Alejandro) took her in the taskforce to have legitimacy. Hitman was said to be coming from CIA which required domestic agency to initiate any program inside US.In the beginning part it was seen they entered into Mexico and saw the inhuman and explosive environment due to the upshots of the drug cartel and its impacts on the human life in Mexico. They brought the brother of Manual Diez, the prominent member of drug cartel in Mexico entering into USA.The taskforce tortured the brother, Guillermo and captured magnificent information about the locations where they trade and found ideas of tunnels through which they pass off the drugs and its locations.All these enraged her and partner. They even could not know what their rules are. They were made to watch what Matt and Alejandro did. In the meantime, Kate even could trace the money laundering crimes of Diez in the US by which she wanted to prosecute against him which the taskforce laughed at.This led to create distrust specially in Reggie the partner of Kate. Even they thought of leaving the taskforce and Kate resisted and started to get prepared for the tunnel mission.The taskforce took with them other professional fighters and tech experts. They were massive in size and operational courage. In the evening when light started to dim off, they initiated their mission. Night vision goggles and other night stuffs were used. In the tunnels, firing continued. The Mexican sides started to fall. In the other side, Alejandro appeared and caught the corrupt police officer who used to pass the drugs from Mexico to the entry of the tunnel. Simultaneously, Kate appeared there which surprised Hitman and Hitman fired on the bulletproof vest of Kate when she pointed gun at Hitman.Hitman took that Cop with him on gun point to the road leading to catching Diez. In the street, he found Diez and fired in the leg and made him pull off from street and get back to driving to the house of Fausto Alarcon, cousin of Diez and Guillermo.Hitman killed the guards of the Alarcon house, the boss of the drug cartel. And hitman came back to USA. Kate got back and confronted Matt and this led to muffling. Matt said that they don't want to end it they want control like once by Madellin. Hitman even was working in the Madellin. The wife and daughter of Alejandro were killed by Alarcon which was another personal reason why he was used as Hitman in the taskforce. This induced him more and led to reaching the Drug Boss and killing his family in front of his eyes and then killing drug boss finally.Alejandro took the sign for approval of the taskforce on gun point from Kate and in the end, she had space to fire him from the veranda. She did not."
" Not my cup of tea though it's a unique one.
",2018-11-09 00:00:00,7,"Sicario is no doubt a very well made film with a director with a vision and imagination as he is always. The music written for the film along with the cinematography must be taught to those who want to make a good movie. The action scenes were done brilliantly by Villeneuve and made me in the middle of the action as If I were there along with the camera movement and it's live shooting with the direct gun shooting. However, despite the great performances , the movie lacked a powerful story and protagonist, by power I mean a solid story with more action scenes and not stretching in the drama and plot scenes that caused me some boring. Also Emily's character despite being the protagonist was completely restricted to it's fear , Ignorance of what's happening and being shocked. Even the movie's end didn't depend on her but gave her a scene in the end which was completely pointless for me and through her vision I couldn't feel the whole film as It suppose to be and it's pointless to have her neglected like that. I can tell that It's one of the weakest protagonist I have ever scene despite being a good character. Villeneuve's work and scenes are distinctive in the film , but the drama scenes that most of the film depended on it with a few action scenes wasn't that good. I say that I can be satisfied with cinematography , the music , the 3 or 4 action scenes including the beginning and ending and not satisfied about the rest even the screenplay that had good lines. 6.5/10"
" Good movie
",2018-11-07 00:00:00,6,Nice Sunday action movie. Well worth watching. Good storyline to this and a nice pace to the action looking form to part 2

She is selected to work with a federal task force to go after Manuel Diaz, the drug lord over US operations. The task force is lead by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) an unorthodox individual with large government pockets. They do things their own way which she describes as ""illegal"" and is apprehensive of being part of a force , but is reassured ""the boundaries been moved. ""Kate is working with a part of the government that doesn't play. I felt the intensity as if this was an Iraqi war film. Kate had a well developed character. There was a good bit of action... ""those aren't fireworks."" This was a different kind of film on the drug war. Good film for those who like war movies.Guide: F-bomb. Near sex. No nudity."
" I'm late!
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,9,"So I just watched Sicario. I know I'm late to the party. I have to say this is a pretty good action/drama. Flows well, not overly suspenseful. The ending is able to wrap things up while still leaving it open for more. Interesting & real enough."
" Great Action
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,7,"When FBI makes a raid on a cartel house in Arizona, they discover several bodies and two local police officers are killed by a booby trap. The leader of the operation Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is summoned to a meeting in the Department of Justice and Kate is invited to join a special force commanded by CIA Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) to fight the cartels. The idealistic Kate brings her partner Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya) and they team up with the force. They learn that the team has the intent to promote havoc in the Sonora Cartel to force one well-known kingpin to come to Mexico to meet the drug lord Fausto Alarcon (Julio Cesar Cedillo) and find his whereabouts. But soon Kate finds that the assignments led by Matt and Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) are absolutely illegal and she discovers why she was invited to join the team.""Sicario"" is a great action film with excellent sequences of shootings. The storyline shows the dilemma of a dedicated and idealistic FBI agent that learns that there is a thin and blurred line between the right and wrong. The plot is well resolved and there is a sequel unfortunately without Emily Blunt. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Sicario: Terra de Ningu√©m"" (""Sicario: No Man Land"")"
" Slow burning, but very intense with shocking scenes, brutal violence and profound realisations.
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,9,"Great acting with an authentic, realistic style and setting which slowly reveals the story to you and lets you draw your own conclusions on whether the actions performed on both sides of the conflict are justifiable."
" Brilliant Movie-Making
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,10,"This isn't a film for wimps. Though I've no first-hand knowledge, I imagine this film brings the viewer about as close to futility, brutality, frustration, and pure adrenaline rush that's felt by law enforcement every day as they continue waging our War on Drugs. It also weaves in storylines of smaller-time players that inevitably get caught up in this multi-billion dollar ""business"" of narcotics, terror, and murder. As good as Traffic was in its day, Sicario narrows the focus somewhat, following Natalie Blunt's character throughout most of the film with only rare (but memorable) shifts to Del Toro's anti-hero. It's also less preachy than Traffic, allowing the audience to draw some of its own conclusions. The violence is measured, at times, but shocking at others. Definitely not for the feint of heart."
" Is acting out of bounds a good thing?
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,8,"Plot (8 out of 10): Although some aspects of it are expected and some characters are not deeply explored, the plot grabs your attention throughout most of the movie.Thrill (7 out of 10): It might be considered way too slow paced for some audience.Entertainment (9 out of 10): If you're up for some heavy crime drama, this movie's up for the task.Soudntrack (7 out of 10): Soundtrack is enough to make the scene, but nothing really stands out.Special Effects (8 out of 10): Some weird ""body heat"" effects towards the end. Most of the movie is fine.Final Score: 7.8 (8).Summary: Sicario is a crime drama thriller about ""making the law"" through dirty acts. It makes you question if that's the way to solve things. I found it straightforward, but something on it took my attention. Acting is great and feels real. Recommended."
" Incredibly Directed movie
",2018-10-05 00:00:00,10,"Sicario is a kind of movie that pull you into it by the pure brilliance of Acting, Direction, Cinematography and Sound. Story Is decent but other elements is top notch and you will be hooked till the end. Del Toro is incredible as emotionless hitman. A scene near the end which shows his Ruthlessness is unique."
" Not bad
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,6,"It's 2018, Hollywood loves to make Mexicans look like innocent people in movies cause of Trump. Watch this movie and they are bad drug dealers trying to get to the US. When was it made? 2014, before Trump was the President. Hmmmmmm Hollywood. That being said, it was an ok movie. Kinda reminded me of a backward Scareface. A bit slow for me though."
" Awful film
",2018-09-27 00:00:00,1,"The best spin I could put on this movie is that it did not really know what it wanted to be. I suspect that the writer(s) wanted to make some PC point about the CIA operating on U.S. soil. Of course, they had to put a woman and a black guy as the leads for this story. Both are wooden and uninspired, especially Blunt, who mostly just looks like she is going to cry because the boys won't let her play. Now *that's* a good role model for your young daughters!The other part of the movie is simply a revenge flick, and not all that good either.It is hard to quarrel with other reviewers who point out the vast disconnect between the critical acclaim and the actual product. I would advise you not to waste 2 hours of your life with this film."
" Great movie
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely fantastic plot, action and suspense! Great actors too."
" great

" Average Film
",2018-09-22 00:00:00,6,Film belongs to the thriller category hence I expected a thrilling experience combined with a curious story. But both were not maintained during the entire film duration. I was looking to uncover the next move of the story in very few occasions but a good thriller should always keep some part of the next move hidden and reveal to the audience later. Thrill comes when there is something more in the story that you donot know and something which will keep you guessing all the time.Invincible Villain who was off the grid for such a long time was really easily captured by the hero. Astonishingly he had like fewer than 10 guards and very low security protocol. He was clearly living in a separate mansion which should be easily target for any enemy. So the plot is some what shaky and has many loopholes.
" mostly good
",2018-09-21 00:00:00,7,"In the southwestern U.S. , an FBI agent (Emily Blunt) is assigned to work for a CIA boss (Josh Brolin) and his associate (Benicio del Toro) in order to break into the leadership of a Mexican drug cartel that was responsible for a kidnapping operation in Arizona .Among the law enforcers, ""Sicario"" gives us the traditional battle between those who go by the book (Blunt) vs. those who just want to get things done (Brolin and del Toro). The performances are all good especially del Toro as a human-turned-animal whose presence is a force of nature. Sadly, the story lacks enough character development that might have added more heft in the conflicts involving principle.The true star of the film is the powerful direction by Denis Villeneuve. Every scene, even those with stillness, has an eerie edge that leaves viewers feeling like they've entered the dark side. There are also a few crowd/action scenes that are brilliantly executed with just the right amount of build-up tension leading to the action. While the film has the expected amount of violence, Villeneuve takes different approaches to minimize the effect such as scenes that show only the shooter but not the victims.Villeneuve has an impressive list of films highlighted by (in my opinion) ""Polytechnique"" (2009). ""Sicario"" is his second Hollywood film, ""Prisoners"" (2013) being the other. Both are good films but I feel each is a build-up to his eventual Hollywood masterpiece (maybe more than one) that is yet to come. I can hardly wait for the event."
" Mix bag
",2018-09-20 00:00:00,6,"The first 30 minutes, and the final 30 minutes are great! The middle hour is rather boring, and it drags on and on. It is funny because Del Toro is mostly in the first 30 minutes and last 30 minutes. He is the highlight of this movie and has the best action scenes. Speaking of action, this movie barely has any action. There is an intense and cool little shootout on a Mexican bridge, and then there is a cool final 20 minutes that have a lot of action and thrills, but overall this movie is actionless. Even if it didn't have action, I would mind if the characters were interesting. Del Toro and Brolin are the two most interesting in this movie, but they decide to focus on Blunt, whose character is so annoying. All she says is ""What is this? What is happening? What the hell? What are we doing?"" Her character is also poorly written because she is so scare and suspicious about what Del Toro and Brolin are doing in Mexico, but then she goes to a bar and hooks up with a dude without any suspicious thinking. She eventually gets attacked and almost raped by the man.Overall, the sounds of the guns are great, and the music is thrilling. I just wished this movie had more action and less of Blunt's character. The movie does end with a really cool quote that would fit perfectly in 'Game of Thrones,"" or ""Lord of The Rings."""
" Nice movie
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,8,"You can't expect where this movie goes to. I like movies you can't imagine the end. If you don't hesitate to watch a bit grotesque movies, you should watch it!"

" garbage packed mive
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,1,"Ive seen good movies and bad ones, and this one is definitely on my top 3 list of the worst moives ive ever seen, its like a movie made by a 10 yrs old kid who thinks that to make an action movie you just need to pack some action scenes and there you go, logic? doesnt matter, story? not needed? any connection between the scenes? thats asking too much.
this is complete garbage, i wont ask you to save your money but save you sanity and dont go watch this garbage, it was sooo bad that i had this angry face throught the whole movie and i still had it 3 or 4 hours later"
" It's good but
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,4,"Even I get Alejandro mission, I get Josh character job but if I was Kate I would have shot Medellin for taking his time to save her, and then shot twice at her then cuts Brolins balls why? Cause they use should have tell her and invate her in, the way they treat her and hurt her that's why I don't like the movie and it's really good and the screep is great and the music, the Spanish not so much but the juarez in the border parts are really good, Alejandro revange is horrible but epic. But I don't like how manipulate her and leaves me with bad taste."

Right?Well...it was okay...I guess. It wasn't bad. I didn't hate it. That's good right? When you don't hate something. I just don't understand why anybody loved it. Great acting yes. Great cinematography yes but I didn't care about the characters. That's most important. What am I missing, other people are seeing? Well I am now missing the sequel ! 6/10"
" Awesome
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,8,Wow where do I star from ? An Absolutely brilliant thriller. While watching this movie I start to remind myself why thrillers are my favourite movies. Does Emily Blunt ever Star in bad movies ? She's such a powerful actress. It's nice to see a female actress play a leading role with stripping down. Awesome move which will keep you on the edge of your seat.
" Slow wins

" Artfully done
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,9,I have rewatched this film 5 times now. It's stunning. The acting is phenomenal. The cinematography is gorgeous. The pacing of scenes to build tension and disturb you is almost mathematical. The score of the film is a great contribution as well to the building of tension or dread depending on the scene. Definitely watch

" Taylor Sheridan is one of the greatest screenwriters in the world.
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,7,"Very realistic. Exciting but a bit boring. I'm looking forward to seeing The Day of Soldado. In my opinion,Wind River is really good. It's better than Hell or High Wartsr. And Hell or High Warter is better than Sicario. What I'm sure to say is that Taylor Sheridan is one of the greatest screenwriters in the world."

" 2 interesting characters...dragged down by 1 weak one
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,6,"Brolin & Del Toro are the stars of the film, second half of the film is almost exclusively focused on Benny the Bull, and is the best part of the movie.Unfortunately, the first half spends far too much time with Blunt's barely competent FBI agent. Either sitting in dark hotel rooms talking about her bra. Or sitting in dark hotel rooms surfing Google Images, because, you know, that's how FBI agents research Mexican Cartels. Or just sitting in dark hotel rooms looking like she'll burst into tears at any minute. Well, that's how she looks for the whole film actually.But I can't completely blame Blunt for this, it's a poorly written character that is used as a clumsy exposition device for the first half of the movie. ""Who are you?"" ""Who is he?"" ""Where are we going?"" ""What are we doing?""
Once all that information has been passed to the viewer, there is no need for the character anymore, and she barely features after that. A better written role or a better actress, probably both, was needed to make this character interesting.The good parts of the film are all about Brolin & Del Toro. The two actors have great chemistry but sadly, Brolin is sorely under used. Benny gets his starring turn, and it is as majestic as it is brutal.Watch it for those two."
" This is no Traffic
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,5,"Can't believe the high rating here(the main reason I tried to stick with it) this is a clunking pile. A decent cast, mouthing clich√© after clich√©. Kate(Blunt) hasn't a clue what's going on so neither do we. I can only surmise that all the positive reviews have been written by company shills. Dross."
" How did this get a sequel?
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,1,"This movie is just down right boring. I am not sure how it has so many good reviews. Emily Blunt's character is just downright whiny & annoying. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it just flops. Not going to be lining up for the sequel."
" Stupidest opening scene ever.
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,3,"The opening scene shows a swat team invading a house. Two guys sit calmly watching TV in the living room when the armored vehicle crashes thru the wall. Eventually the swat team opens up newly dry-walled walls, the screw holes having been spackled. Inside the walls are dozens of dead bodies, wrapped in plastic, standing upright. What is wrong with this? The guys watching TV have no problem with the smell of decaying corpses. The swatters don't smell anything until they start opening the walls. The corpses stand upright without any visible support (rigor mortis is very temporary). The walls are being prepared for painting. Did they think no one would notice how thick the walls would have to be to enclose dead bodies?"
" Shocking & Powerful Yet Subdued Thriller
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,8,"The pace and captivating screenplay give nods to what is going on. Nothing is made clear and the subtleties are something you explore as you watch. A Film that isn't too loud but isn't too quiet either. 
 It may lose your attention at certain points but persevere and watch to the end for the brutal moments that depict a powerful story of US special operations and simple revenge that drags down all that stand in it's wake."
" An adventure
",2018-07-18 00:00:00,7,"Sicario is a timely movie as our nation focuses on the conflicts that come from the border. In this movie the top levels of the US government are trying to create a diversion. As most hatch out plans, this one does not go as planned. A good action adventure movie."
" Movie or a Documentary??
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,4,"With a high IMDB rating and reviews, I decided to watch this movie and was disappointed. It seems like a Documentary or a TV show packaged as Movie. 
Someone who has grown up on 80's action, the type of action shown in this, fails to impress. In the name of realism, there is only sound and light show. With movies like this, labelled as action/thriller, I can see why comic book movies are doing so good. Even if its CGI, its action, its thrill, its fantasy. 
In the name of realism I came across something boring. 
I don't care about that technical brilliance, if its dull and boring. Even the plot doesn't have much substance. I mean, there are many loose ends. Who were those people, whose bodies we saw in opening and why were they killed etc etc. From kidnapping, to illegal immigrants, it finally zeroes on to drug use.Everyone is clueless in movie about why certain things are happening, what to do etc etc. Only Josh Brolin and that other guy Benicio Del Toro seem to know everything and they are keeping it to themselves. 
In the end they reveal everything, with a casual one liner. Which doesn't even raise an eye brow, neither from the viewers or even actors. 
Emily Blunt, she looks tired and worn out.
Better to call it a Drama, with a international border drug smuggling theme than an action/thriller, because there was hardly any thrill in it."
" Underrated, gripping, and real
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,9,"The action set pieces are terrific, there is heavy realism, the morality aspect binds the entire movie together. Great performances from all actors."
" Intense with no cheap gimmicks
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,9,"I really liked this movie. It just has a different mood to it, and as the plot uncoils, I feel like it all makes sense, as to why it feels this way. I'll be off to see the 2nd offering soon."
" Very intense, entertaining and emotional
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,10,"Unlike many movies, I didn't get tired at the middle of it. Benicio del Toro and Emily Blunt were both incredible. I hope Sicario 2 does justice this year."
" Killed By Horrible Writing
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,1,"Powerful presentation of the reality of life in the hellhole of Juarez, of the struggle to escape into the US, of the ruthlessness of all sides of the cartel war, and US agency efforts to fight back; but the story is essentially killed by the absurd portrayal of FBI agents who are supposed to be 'idealistic' but come across as zombie wimps. And the whole premise of inserting FBI agents into a cross-border CIA operation just to give authority for stateside operations, and refusing to tell them what they are doing, is absurd, as is the FBI agents whining about questionable procedures. Blunt's character is just annoying in her timidity, particularly when she is portrayed in the first scenes as a kick-butt, door smashing federal cop. Here is where the writing is horrible - FBI / CIA chief (it isn't clear) tells Blunt's character that she is volunteering for a joint agency operation, authorized by the President (or, an 'elected official'), and doesn't tell her the nature of the operation? And then she and her silent FBI partner spend the rest of the movie whining about the questionable nature of the operation. This would have been a phenomenal movie if the conflict with the timid FBI agents had been left out. I'm hoping that Sicario 2 will delete the wimpy sideshow, and just show the reality of the cartel war."
" Bland
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,1,"Upon recommendation I watched this feature with anticipation. After the first ten minutes I thought yeah great, original and feasible action. And that was it until ten minutes from the end where it picked up again. Whole feature could have been condensed into 25 minutes. Direction good, production okay, cast average and storyline poor. Wont get that two hours back."
" This is the land of wolves now.
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,7,"Emily Blunt plays Kate Macer, the leader of a rescue response unit with the FBI. She gets recruited for a major offensive against drug cartels in Mexico, having to work for some very cagey people. The guy in charge is Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), and he's not forthcoming with many details. She also must deal with an enigmatic stranger named Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), along for the ride in some sort of advisory capacity. There will be some surprises in store for Kate as she embarks upon this sordid journey.The term ""Sicario"" gets explained at the outset; in Mexico, it's the word for ""hitman"". That lets us know that we're going to be in for something a bit different. You won't see the sort of typical action-movie treatment of such material. In fact, there are no real action set pieces to speak of. In their place, we get a nuanced, low-key, somewhat grounded drama of cops vs. crooks. We also get a narrative (written by Taylor Sheridan) in which ""good"" guys aren't always so clearly defined, and where you have people like Graver, whose job it is to sort of ""shake things up"" so that drug lords like Fausto Alarcon (Julio Cesar Cedillo) deviate from their usual patterns. In the end, this war on drugs reduces some people to utterly ruthless and cold-blooded methods.Director Denis Villeneuve never tries to dazzle you. His filmmaking efficiency is of a more matter-of-fact style, as he eases you into the story bit by bit. There is a fairly devastating explosion (and loss of life) near the beginning that does influence Kates' actions for the rest of the picture, and a decent shootout in traffic as obviously unsavoury types are spotted by the authorities.Extremely well shot (the cinematography is by Roger Deakins, so that comes as no surprise), it features good acting by a cast also including Victor Garber (""Titanic"" '97), Jon Bernthal ('The Walking Dead'), Daniel Kaluuya (""Get Out""), Jeffrey Donovan ('Burn Notice'), and Raoul Max Trujillo (""Apocalypto""). Blunt is fine as an idealistic young woman who gets an eye-opening, Brolin is pretty amusing, and Del Toro is excellent as he gives a very controlled performance.Much tragedy and devastation has been the result of decades of drug wars, and ""Sicario"" illustrates this quite well.Seven out of 10."
" Why is the rating so high?
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,3,"This is an extremely boring movie. All the characters are 2 dimensional, and unlikeable. What a waste."
" Incredibly tense , all round great thriller!
",2018-07-07 00:00:00,8,"Denis Villeneuve is on a roll...........this film is great and only enhances his position as one of the best up and coming modern directors today. Right from the opening scenes this film entices you in and never lets go of you, it is incredibly tense and hard to watch at times. There are two main reasons this film grabs a hold of you, one being the fantastic story/writing and the other is the characters/performances. The directing across the board is sublime, gorgeous shots of Mexico that are obviously enhanced by Roger Deakins cinematography. These beautiful wide angel shots are complimented extremely well with really close up action set pieces. The set piece across the boarder in the traffic jam has got to be one of the most tense scenes in a film recently, incredible work.As previously mention the story/writing of this film is extremely good and makes for a riveting watch. It carries along a really tough subject with a lot of complex character background without letting one overshadowing the other. All the characters backstories are fleshed out really well throughout the film whilst still contributing to the overall story. Taylor Sheridan definitely deserves a shout out for this, really good work. A story that I've never seen before, extremely realistic and grounded.The cast is very very good, firstly Emily Blunt who is the audiences eyes as the film progresses as she is seeing the same things we are for the first time. Plays a sort of fish out of water but can stand her own ground. What I mean by fish out of water is the fact that she is completely out of her depth and doesn't know what is going in the outset. Her character arc throughout is really good and has a satisfying end. Josh Brolin is very good as the charismatic leader of the team that definitely has his complexities to him. As the film goes a long you never really know 100 percent if he is telling the whole truth, he is a little bit wild and unpredictable. This makes is relationship between his character and Blunts all the more interesting. However the best performance of the film is Benicio del Toro, just jaw dropping at times, is seemingly peaceful and friendly one minute and the next he is brutally murdering people. Fantastic performance all round, probably has the most depth to his character as well, as to the reason why he is helping the Americans. Brutally fantastic.Last couple of positives are Roger Deakins, his cinematography is always incredible and is probably the best cinematography around, truly beautiful work. The last positive is the score by Johann Johannsson which is extremely haunting and only increases the tension throughout the film, simply brilliant score and fantastic use of it, it comes and goes and is only used when necessary.Overall this film is 85% out of 100 or 8.5 out of 10, this is a very good film that has opened up an entirely new genre to explore, fantastic work from Denis Villeneuve, will this man ever make a bad film, probably not. Taylor Sheridan for the incredible story and characters. The three main cast members are all fantastic, must also quickly shoutout Daniel Kaluuya, good little role from him. Score and Cinematography are real highlights as well, there aren't any negatives really, I suppose it can drag a little and pace of the film can be hit and miss at times. All in all and truly great film not for everyone but extremely riveting and entertaining."
" Perfect in its own right
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,10,"This move is simply outstanding. The directing, the acting from the 3 main characters, being Josh Brolin, Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro is very believable. The story is very compelling. The cinematography is gorgeous. The futility of the drug war, and its literal elimination of morality, lingers throughout the film. Emily Blunt and Del Toro are flawless in tension together as their values clash, and Brolin fits the typical American bravado role seamlessly. It is one of its kind, a movie addressing the Mexican/US drug cartel concerns, and executing it with utter class, style and realism."
" A movie worth to watch
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,8,"As an amateur viewer so do not bury me with you cinema knowledge for that.I saw this film and i really liked that.
In my personal point of view the best part of the movie is Del Toro acting. Beautiful , real and disciplined acting by Del Toro. His acting and movements so professional and classy.
Cinematography is perfect. Sound edit way perfect than it looks.
Most important thing is camera movement, Smooth .Simple and Enough , No camera on hand and run like crazy unlike the Hollywood movies these days. (Damn that camera on hands are headaches.)There is just 1 minor problem in storytelling . I think the script needed to be saturated some more about the drug cartels and their operations.And there is 1 big problem and that is Emily Blunt and Daniel Kaluuya acting.
Blunt is flimsy and heavy , very much filled with fake and made-up confusing looks. She is so much unreal that you will ask during the whole movie : Why she is here ?! If you want to get to a cartel leader then you should know there is no written procedures for this type of operations. And if you do not like it , then why you and Kaluuya are here ? You cannot pretend to want some maniac Druglord badly and yet behave like you don't know what these Druglords look like and question everything and demand everyone their intents plus their reasons and if she does not like those she threaten to walk.
No body forces her and his mate to join for this kind of operations.Overall , this is very well made movie with a very good acting and story."
" Great movie....
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,9,Just a handful of movies that i wish it wouldn't end after the first 100 minutes...griping from the first second. The cinematography was captivating and beautiful with its areal shots....just watch this movie and enjoy it...it deserves much more accolades and awards than what its gotten...
" An uneasy and tense thriller, rendered in shades of grey.
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,8,"There's an underlying seediness to 'Sicario (2015)', an unseen sense of evil that strengthens with each scene that blurs the line between 'good' and 'bad'. This is amplified by every aspect of the production, from the astute and assured direction to the earthy and understated screenplay, which leads to an experience steeped in tension and weight, one that communicates just as much through its fantastically framed vistas as it does through its brief but frenetic violence. It's a slow burn of a thriller, one that doesn't culminate in a massive action set-piece but rather a demolition of what you previously understood was going on - in terms of plot, morality and, especially, character. After a an act of pure brutality finally pulls back the curtain on a previously mysterious character - and, by extension, a certain way of thinking - in an unexpected and gut-wrenching way, all preconceptions fall away and you realise just how dark the narrative really is. The movie's haunting end implies devastating consequences for those on the ground-level of this ever escalating war on drugs. The movie doesn't give you any easy answers and makes you question everything you see the supposed 'good guys' do, soon shedding any suggestion of such a thing even existing. If you don't think you're doing the right thing, though, then how can you do it? It is a phenomenally deep question and one that resides in the heart of our protagonist and the overall piece. It's these shades of grey that really make the movie so compelling and ripe for discussion. It aims to start a conversation and can easily do so. Most importantly, it's an engaging and impactful experience. It will get under your skin and, almost certainly, truly affect you, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout, sometimes unnerved but always unable to look away. 8/10"

" Suspense Captured With Perfect Precision
",2018-06-29 00:00:00,9,"Decided to rewatch Denis Villeneuve's Sicario in preparation for Sicario 2. I still consider Sicario to be one of the best movies ever made in terms of ""technicality."" Nearly all the editing and visual aspects inserted in this film are perfectly crafted in my opinion. It has a nice, slow, steady pace that Villeneuve has learned to master exceptionally at this point. Performances are top notch, and the third act of this film blows me away every time I witness it. It's indeed, a traumatizing look into the world we live in today and the dark incentives the human mind will develop. (Verdict: A)"
" Women hating crap
",2018-06-27 00:00:00,3,"This film had one female role and she can barely hold a gun even though she is squat made no sense at all, full of male machismo bs aren't we all tired of this genre? Yes we are"
" Has some Charm
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,7,"I'll be honest with you and mention that half the reason I ended up watching this film was because I was captivated by the trailer for the sequel. Well, I guess the producers would be pretty happy with that, but then again I probably shouldn't get too caught up with trailers because sometimes they really don't tell you all that much about the film. Then again, I guess getting another opportunity to watch Thanos, or rather Josh Borlin, in action was going to suit me well.
 As it turned out I didn't mind this film all that much, particularly since it was pretty much told from the perspective of Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) who is trying to work out what is going on. She starts off as an FBI agent working in the kidnap squad (give them points for that, since most of the time they are either working homicide or narcotics - kidnap is original) when she uncovers a house were a heap of bodies have been hidden in the walls (and how nobody actually smelled the stench in the entire neighbourhood, let alone as soon as they entered is beyond me - then again they might have been responding to a 'there is a putrid smell coming from next door' call, but why send the FBI, why not sanitation).
 Anyway, she attracts the attention of Josh Brolin who asks if she wants to tag along for an operation. She invites her buddy along, only to discover that he isn't allowed into the airforce base, only to tag along for the rest of the film, you know, for somebody to actually talk to because Brolin and this Mexican friend (del Toro) are just so full of conversation. We can't have an actor suffering in silence, can we, especially since Brolin falls straight asleep as soon as they get on the private jet.
 So, lets start with this whole going into Mexico and kidnapping a prisoner, only to have the entire police force, you know the ones who are just so effective against the drug lords, escort them through town and back again. Then there is the hugely packed road back into the United States, which conveniently gives the gangsters an opportunity to make a strike at them, when if these guys are like black ops, and have authority from on high, surely they could have used the less crowded opposite side of the road. Oh, and then there is all this CIA this, you know, they guess that he is CIA, but he denies it, and they all talk about how CIA aren't allowed to operate in the United States, only to suddenly have it revealed at the end that they can, if they are attached to a domestic agency, which is why we end up having all these FBI 'observers' on CIA missions. Surely, surely, surely they would have known that, but then again it would have undermined the big reveal, the 'we have been denying that he is CIA for the entire movie to suddenly admit that he is in fact CIA'.
 Look, this movie isn't all that bad, a little slow at parts, though I did appreciate Kate 'only has one T-shirt in her entire wardrobe' Macer. Then again Blunt seems to play this tough characters pretty well, if some of her other films are anything to go by. Also the fact that the entire story is actually told from her perspective also gives this film a bit more panache than many of the other films do. A bit unrealistic in parts, but still good."
" Dark and beautiful, cannot wait for the sequel
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,9,"A career best for Del Toro, who is unusually articulate in this beautifully shot, masterful work. Underrated and dark, dark, dark."
" Time to meet God.
",2018-06-21 00:00:00,10,"Sicario means ""Hitman"" in spanish. And that's all you need to know for the plot.Emily Blunt plays Kate, an FBI agent specialized in SWAT work and heavy cases.But she finds herself wrapped in something much much more complex, a drug case of epic proportions without mercy affecting both sides of the border. She gives an oscar-worthy performance here, someone who knows so so much but at the same time so little. She portrays everything the audience feels and she is badass but with enough weakness for you to sympathize with her.Josh Brolin plays Matt, and he does an amazing job with his role as a DOD Advisor. Theres a lot of questions i have for his character, and i can't wait to see him more in Soldado.The visuals and soundtrack deserve praise, with the late Johan Johannson providing the soundtrack which is eerie and terrifiyng.And Benicio Del Toro. 
He gives a career-best performence as the ghost, the man without mercy. Alejandro is a perfect combination of writing and performance, and he steals every scene he is in.
Sicario is well worth the watch. A razor sharp thriller without mercy and its jawdropping visuals boost it higher then most. And when you see him, the wolf, the hitman, the one who ends it all.
You'll see why it is called Sicario.10/10"
" Intense, thoughtful, elegant, yet runs dry...
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,7,"Do not be misguided by my headline, I loved this movie and Villeneuve's ability to give it such a gritty, realistic feel. It truly inspired me to think about my own moral values and what I would do under the circumstances of the characters portrayed. But it did not make me want a sequel.This is not an angry review about Hollywood's inability to leave a good movie alone, it is simply about how this movie ended without the viewer wanting more. The ending was solid, but not enticing enough for me to truly believe Kate would do something about the corrupt government, and especially didn't beg me to wonder what Alejandro was up to next. This isn't a flaw, this was done on purpose. After all of the twists and turns, Sicario gives us an ending that leaves us comfortable with its resolution. The acting was perfect, the writing behind it all was ingenious, and the directing was sufficient enough to pull out a film that makes people think about the story as much as the action.My only complaint is the editing. Cut down that freaking night scene where they enter the tunnel a couple minutes so that I don't fall asleep watching glowing figures point guns at nothing. It didn't add to the suspense, the suspense was meant to be in the tunnel itself, where I ended up seeing only one cartel member already knifed to death on the ground. Then what the heck is Blunt's character doing after Del Toro's is already in Mexico? No idea, they chose not to bring her back until he's back in the US threatening to kill her. 7/10 for me simply because it was really great, with an ending of relief not having to go through more poorly edited action scenes. Villeneuve, stick to dramas, they are your cup of tea."
" Emily Blunt looks pensive and then...wait for it..wait some more.
",2018-06-18 00:00:00,3,"40 minutes into this and Blunt has 70% of the screen time and 5% of the dialogue. Its like she was given the same instruction as A Quiet Place -- don't say anything. One reviewer compared this to Traffic. In that it is about Mexican drug wars, yes. Traffic however had script, plot, character development. Note to the director; maybe two or three shots per film you can extract some artistic value from an actor's facial expressions, if you do it 9 out of 10 shots it gets lame fast. Really unbelievable scene at the El Paso border just adds to the non-cerebral result of this film. Going to my review of Miss Sloan now; 9/10. Sloan has more dialogue in first 5 minutes than Blunt has in the whole film of Sicaro."
" Had to watch it twice to allow me to write this review
",2018-06-14 00:00:00,6,"REVIEW - SICARIOWas told about this 2015 film from a guy who I work with who loved it so much he went out and bought the DVD. Finally got round to watching it. Whilst the story is interesting with a few twists it doesn't really grab and keep your attention which is important for a film like this because it is a story you have to follow. Had to watch the film twice to allow me to write this review. Ok nothing special, interesting worth watching, couldn't happen in red life but certainly entertaining. 2 gripes which stood out, hence why I had to watch the film twice. The police officer who wore the Green and Pink wrist band, we the audience saw him taking a call after the FBI or whoever they were froze all of the money but how did the female FBI officer know about the wrist band and another thing, as they were drinking in the bar how did she not see the wrist band sooner. But the main gripe for me was the female FBI agent, why was she even there? She served no real use or purpose?Was expecting a 10 from being told how great it was but honestly only got a.........Sicario 2 is out soon, I think I'll be giving it a miss. Rating 6 out of 10"
" Dark, Gritty, Sometimes Disturbing...
",2018-06-02 00:00:00,9,"... but still amazing. Let me list off a few things: the cinematography is gorgeous, the dialogue is genuine, the actors are spot on and the score is harmonious with the plot. This is such a well put together film.Surprisingly my favorite part of Sicario is Emily Blunt's character--not because I agree with her, far from it, but I can understand where she is coming from. Her precarious involvement and her contrasting beliefs with the others just makes this for me.Another thing: the tension and realism in this movie is perfect. PERFECT!This is not a high-paced action film. If you loved Hell or High Water and Law Abiding Citizen you will greatly appreciate this movie."
" Do not miss this crime thriller at any cost !
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,9,"Denis Villeneuve is in top form and Sicario should further prove the point that he is a master director, one of the best modern auteurs. Impeccably acted by Blunt, Brolin and Del Toro Sicario is suspenseful and exciting."
" Pessimistic
",2018-05-05 00:00:00,4,"Production is top-rate but some aspects of story are weak. Surely Kate (FBI) would be aware why Matt (CIA) needed her along. This was obviously withheld to add an extra element of suspense. But it's really a trick and probably like Kate we don't like being fooled! Later, I read a review that said the film is wholly pessimistic. This is very true. Kate (Blunt) is outmanoeuvred at every turn and is unable to fight back. We are left feeling helpless that government cannot do anything but play outside the rules. And all that was really achieved was vengeance."
" Incredible movie!
",2018-04-24 00:00:00,10,"So amazing, definately the best movie i have ever seen."
" Taylor Sheridan is a genius!
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,8,"Besides the masterful technical aspect and the powerful performances, the movie has earned its place among the best revenge thriller movies due to telling this story from a new perspective.This is the thing that make every turning point and every reveal seems like a subtle plot twist.The moral dilemma is the weakest point in Sicario; as it was represented in a very direct way, made me less captivated throughout the movie, and also made me take a while to engage with the story. (8/10)"
" The Gum Chewing Is a Real Distraction to an Otherwise Good Film
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,8,"Real and gritty, but seriously -- there is no reason for all the disgusting chewing. It totally ruins many of Josh Brolin's scenes."
" That's what I'm talking about!!!
",2018-04-11 00:00:00,9,I can watch this movie every 4 months and enjoy it everytime.
" Not present tense for sure
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,3,"I heard this movie is tense. I cannot comprehend this judgment. It's slow, and there is simply nothing happening to create the tension. Characters act like things are tense, and mumble psychopathic one-liners that seem to be supposed to shock the viewer and show how hardened they are, but it's just grotesque. The scenery keeps throwing unsubtle hints at you to claim there's imminent danger, but there's none. When it finally arrives, it's underwhelming. Makes one wonder how cartels weren't all just shot to death yet. I gave up after 40 minutes of nearly silent walking and driving around, pretentiously gazing into the void, with a couple minutes of establishing how blindly idealistic the main character is against all logic.I'm guessing (so not a spoiler) it'll be her downfall, she'll be betrayed, and no matter if her character will develop (probably not!) she'll have no effect on the plot and the baddies will win. So edgy. Then the movie will pretend it's some insightful social commentary. No. It's clich√©, banal and predictable, that's what it is. Given how sedating and kitschy it is so far, I don't even care to find out. Ask yourself, do you?"
" Superb ! Tense thriller !
",2018-03-27 00:00:00,8,"A must watch thriller based on crackdown efforts by US joint-agencies on the Mexican Drug mafia. Emily Blunt, playing the role of an idealistic FBI agent in the plot represents the general audience, through her actions and reactions to the out-of-the-book methods of the team.
One of those movies which are rightly paced at right moments, with excellent cinematography and background music score. The build-up to the tense moments, when the viewer knows something is about to happen but when and how, is the USP of this movie.
A must watch for those seeking tense, paced and realistic action thriller, with no over-the-top action sequences and silly dialogues."
" What the ... ?
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,7,"I have no idea why this movie got such a high rating. I really wanted to see it and I was really disappointed when I did. It's not stupid or horrible, it's just empty. This is probably going to be my shortest review ever because I have nothing good nor bad to say about it, it's just 2 hours of talking with a 2min gunfight. Which would be kinda fine if the trailer and the poster wasn't trying to sell you an action thriller..."
" Rare modern masterpiece
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,9,"Intensely pinpointing your attention while increasing the heartbeat until the last second! Ultimately rare masterpiece of action and thriller, upon which many should learn how it should be done."
" I feel bad leaving this movie a review.
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,5,"I probably shouldn't be writing this movie a review because I didn't finish it, but I am anyways. It was really boring so I stopped about 20 minutes in. The sound design is bad. The acting is bad. Nothing really happens its just boring. Maybe it gets better, I don't know, but what I watched was just boring."
" Can't Wait For The Next One
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,9,"The performances made by Benecio Del Toro, Josh Brolin and Emily Blunt are sure to toy with your emotions. This was an amazing depiction of the dire state of affairs in cartel/gang controlled territories where the daily monotony of life is truly unconscionable. The story line examines how law enforcement is engaging with an enemy that is dangerous enough to overthrow the Mexican government. It is made very clear that the boundaries of morality are no longer defined, meaning that the viewer will be left to decide for themselves whether the each of these characters are justified in how the cope with their own plight. Captivating shootouts and shocking realism are constant theme in the movie. Couldn't look away from start to finish and would certainly watch again sometime."
" 2nd favorite movie of 2015
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,9,"This was just behind Spotlight for me in 2015. In addition to a great story and acting, I really liked the soundtrack to this film."
" Another brilliant piece of Villeneue
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,9,"The exciting crime-drama from Canadian director Denis Villeneue, brought the already-perfect work of cinema to a more popular genre. His early work with films such as ""enemy"" didn't seem catch the audience as much as Sicario did. We follow Emely Blunts character who dwells into the unknown territory of federal organisations, when hunting down mobsters and drug-lords in Mexico. The longer into the plot we go, the more interesting it gets! The acting is really good, and the cinematography and setting is extremely satisfying to watch. From beginning to end, the film keeps us guessing in different directions, while the best parts of the plot are almost hidden in the details. This makes the film hard to follow for the first viewing, which is why you should watch it at least twice! Because there's a ton of details and characteristics to analyse on."
" You know it's bad when...
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,2,"...you're hoping the lead character gets blown up by a cartel. But trust me, it would be a mercy killing! Good LORD Emily Blunt's character was ANNOYING. She destroyed the whole movie, what there was of it. Why in the WORLD would ANY task force WANT to recruit that whiny biotch?!!! WHY??!!! That's what I kept asking myself throughout the first hour of this torture. After that, it was moot. I turned it off. Take some real world advice...do yourself a favor and follow suit. You've been warned. (And some advice for anyone doing any kind of serious interrogation: forget about water boarding; make your suspect watch the full 2 hours of THIS mess. S/he will BEG YOU to turn it off and gladly tell you everything you want to know in exchange.)"
" Brutal, haunting film
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,9,"I was riveted by this film from beginning to end.I won't quibble too much with some of the negative reviews here, but I think some of the reviewers missed the point. As a society, we are caught in a trap of violence, which the writer, Taylor Sheridan explores in his three recent films. We know the 'drug wars' are brutal...but we don't really understand just how brutal it is. To me, that's the reason for the charnel house opening scene, to really try and grasp how inhuman people have become.Emily Blunt's character is obviously there as the point of view of the audience, 'the good cop', who believes in the rule of law, who knows that there is almost unimaginable violence in the world--but hasn't really accepted it yet.Her having to face that brutality, and to turn away from her foundational belief in that rule of law is her character arc, and it's superbly done.Everything about the film was excellent. Brolin and Del Toro were very compelling and I'm excited to see more of their story this summer. The cinematography was gorgeous, the raw landscape and towering skies are an integral part of the story. I thought the music great as well.I've watched the film several times now, and have been impressed each time. Highly recommended."
" Sicario builds tension through suspenseful orchestrated set pieces.
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Let's face it, it has put me off going to Mexico...forever. Joking aside, the visceral gritty thrills portrays Ju√°rez as cartel central. Whether or not the depiction is entirely accurate, it's hard not to be absorbed by the dark world that is perceived. A keen FBI agent is recruited by a mysterious individual tasked with targeting the head of a Mexican cartel. She encounters Alejandro who's motives are blurred and, with cartel members around every corner, paranoia starts to settle. Denis Villeneuve's cinematic direction, Taylor Sheridan's sharp script, Roger Deakins' beautiful cinematography and the late J√≥hann J√≥hannson's unsettling score are impeccable. A symphony of tension that is individually powered by electrifying technical components. It comes to no surprise that all of the above are outstanding, they each just make film making effortless. The perfect scene to illustrate my point is the night vision tunnel infiltration. Monochromatic night vision, bass heavy score, first person viewpoint and dialogue that could prepare a succulent fajita in seconds. Absolutely incredible, scenes like that are rare to find in modern thrillers. Then we come to Benicio Del Toro who portrays a very elusive character, to which is one of his best performances. His stance, his cutthroat dialogue and his death stare all blend together to create an utterly intimidating enigma. Do not mess with him! Josh Brolin, Emily Blunt and Daniel Kaluuya also bring their A-game. Several critics disagreed with the ending, however I found the tonal shift to work. The change in character focus which reveals true motives within the plot was seamless. What I do not agree with, is the use of Kate. As a protagonist, she was pointless and simply was a plot device which therefore meant I didn't connect with her. The incarnation of female empowerment she is not. This might be my least favourite Villeneuve film, but it's still impressive nonetheless. He has yet to put a foot wrong."
" The King is Dead, Long Live the King
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,8,"I re-watched Sicario lately and well, it is still a fine piece of a movie. A great cast with Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and the great Benicio Del Toro, a good story, a good directing, and a top production.This movie gives us a really dark glimpse into the world of the big bizz of drug-trafficking and the war against drugs and its kings. Dark, outstanding and a must-see. One of the best movies in the past few years regarding the genre of crime and drama with a good shot of action."
" The ineffectiveness of idealism
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,8,"Sicario places you in the shoes of an idealistic FBI agent, Kate, as she naively enters the enigmatic and brutal world of covert operations within the cross-border drug trade, hoping to make a difference. Kate represents our own naivete and idealism about the war on drugs. Like her character, the viewer is completely lost most of the time and occasionally enlightened to certain aspects of the operation only to later realize that they understood nothing at all. The film ultimately strives to break down your idealism and put its efficacy into question. The CIA has essentially contracted a Colombian hit man, Alejandro, who is apparently a former Colombian prosecutor whose family was brutally murdered by a merciless Mexican drug lord. How Alejandro went from lawyer to special forces assassin is besides the point. Ultimately the CIA assists Alejandro in murdering this Mexican drug lord to help the Colombian cartel take over because, supposedly, they were better at keeping order, don't murder as many innocent people, and have probably made a deal to keep the brutality of the drug trade away from crossing the U.S. border. That's the end game: to reduce the violence by placing a less brutal leader at the head of the Mexican drug trade. The CIA are not presented as good guys but simply as problem solvers. They know that as long as drugs are illegal in the U.S. and the public provides a demand, the war for control of the drug trade within Mexico will continue to rage. Inconveniently, however, it has gotten too close to home and spilled over the border and onto U.S. soil because the current drug lord didn't get the memo that he can't do that. And so this presents the problem they have been tasked with solving. They have to dethrone the gang that has lost control and allowed this spillover of violence onto U.S. soil. So they turn to the Colombian drug cartels for help. Everyone is a pawn, Alejandro is using the CIA to get his own revenge, the Columbian cartel is using Alejandro and the CIA to gain control over the Mexican drug trade, and finally the CIA is using Kate to legitimize an illegal operation.Over the course of the film, Kate's idealism is systematically broken down, which leads to the conclusion of the movie where she is forced to sign the paperwork legitimizing the operation. While she tries to hold on to some vestige of her idealism in initially refusing to sign the paperwork, she ultimately chooses not to shoot Alejandro as he is walking away. Why? Because she reluctantly has come to understand what he did and its necessity, and because she is not sure whether shooting him is the wrong or the right thing to do, just like the viewer is not sure what is wrong and what is right throughout the entire film, even as everything is finally revealed. That's how she holds on to the last piece of her idealism, she doesn't take action, making her ineffective. That is why she is not a wolf in a town full of wolves, as Alejandro tells her before he leaves. Ultimately, the film suggests there is no place for idealists in war, or at least the war on drugs, because idealists are paralyzed by their idealism and are ultimately ineffective because they cannot justify the means with the ends. At the same time, the subtlety of the film might also suggest that the idealists are better than the pragmatists and that the pragmatists like to think they are more effective than they actually are."
" Bloody smashing
",2018-02-12 00:00:00,8,"Denis Villeneuve knows how to make them real, tense and smart. Flaws are few but there are some. A SWAT girl not knowing enough about the drug war to not get upset, seems unlikely. Also not listening to their experienced parners seems a big no-no when bullets flies that often. A big boss not having more than 4 body guards, also not likely. As a documentary, no, but as a film, yes. Bravo!"
" Breathtaking
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,8,"Simply brutal. It grabs you by the collar and throws you around without any mercy or compassion and does not give you a mere split second to get your breath back. Just like Mercer, you're very much left in the dark throughtout the majority of the runtime and that really helps building tension and making you feel at unease. ""Sicario"" doesn¬¥t spare anything , it shoots it all against the wall wether you like it or not.""(...) and this is the land of wolves now""."
" Decent movie but why the PC propaganda?
",2018-01-30 00:00:00,7,"Why does Hollywood deliberately make an obvious attempt to PC down the movies?Emily Blunt as a FBI task force agent? Really? It feels distracting and forced. There is no way Emily Blunt would be doing this in real life, nor did I believe for a second Blunt was a FBI agent.What did she add? Nothing. She was weak and not up for the task. There was ZERO reason to cast her other than to put a women in.Everything she did made no sense. Questioning her superiors in front of other people, constantly calling them out for dong something ""wrong."" It grew tiresome very quickly. She claimed not to be a soldier but in the beginning she was part of a SWAT team during a raid. And are we really supposed to believe for one second she almost overpowered the big dude in the hotel? And the worst part of it is, she constantly says yes to the mission of getting the people she wants to get, but every step of the way she speaks against the mission. That is one fundamental flaw that takes this film down a few notches.Without Emily Blunt this would have been an awesome movie, but she brought it down, not her acting, but her character, decisions and her even being put in the situations.I don't even care that they used her. Her own behavior was ridiculous and not of any law enforcement on that level that volunteered to fight the top Mexican cartels. No cop is told NOT to do something and then just goes ahead and does it anyway. Especially when it is something she repeatedly says she wants to do.They tell her not to do something, of course she does it. I mean, who does that? Only in the movies.Also, does everyone in Hollywood have to be British nowadays? Why couldn't they find an American actress to play the part? And she had to be ""the one"" they went to? Come on, how dumb do they think we are? Stop casting people based on gender and race. And just cast whoever is best.Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro are the best thing about this. The movie does get better over time. Cinematography is amazing, so kudos to Deakins."
" Everyone uses everyone
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,8,"The score of this film consists of threatening hums and rumbles, underscoring the bleakness that pervades Sicario. In an effort to get at a cartel jefe, everyone uses everyone. A Medell√≠n operative uses US agents to get the man who killed his family. US agents use and innocent FBI agent to legitimize a completely illegitimate operation. Everyone uses everyone in some way.The drama (there is no action, except killings after killings to illustrate the depravity of the situation, on all sides, and even those with no side) stays tense throughout the film. No secrets are kept from the viewer as the main characters slowly learn what is really happening, very much in the style of Hitchcock thrillers, where the tension never relied on viewer ignorance beyond any ignorance of the characters.It's a depressing film, but seems only too believable. When the fight for 'good' stoops to the same low level as 'evil,' everything just seems crass and brutish and disgusting. No wonder the heroine is about the only major character a viewer can identify with. She's like a babe in arms thrown to the wolves, as Benicio del Toro remarks towards the end of the film. Strangely, although she cannot kill him, she's the only character with any courage in this film, even though she signs off an affidavit legitimizing the whole affair with a gun at her throat.The film made me mostly just shudder while watching it. If you're inclined to think that most drugs should be legitimized (like alcohol was after the prohibition), this film will do about the best possible to support your view. Cigarettes and alcohol kill a lot of people, but not with as much collateral damage."
" Del Toro is del bomb!
",2018-01-08 00:00:00,9,"In Spanish, Sicario means a hired assassin or killer. Boy does it!
Great opening! The first 7 minutes are crazy intense! Actually, the whole film is! It seems like every scene is filled with tension, stress, and danger. It's a very good movie, a deep look at the ""war on drugs"" along the U.S./Mexico border. And Benicio Del Toro is just awesomely savage and amazing in his role! My only negative, is that it really reminds me of a book that I read, ""The Power of the Dog"" by Don Winslow, which came out 9 years before this movie. It does not take anything away from the power of this film, I'm just saying they seem similar."
" Smooth intensity
",2018-01-03 00:00:00,9,"If you need to take your mind away from something that is worrying you, watch this movie. You'd not have time to think about anything else. The intensity is very high and the editing is superbly done --- it's a smooth intensity.If firearms is your forte, you'd also like the good variety of military small arms.All in all, the entertainment factor is very high and the story nicely crafted."
" Flawed Casting, Flawed Script, Flawed Execution
",2017-12-31 00:00:00,4,"It's actually difficult to tell where the fault lies with this one. Is it a case of Emily Blunt being completely mis-cast as a bad-ass, door-kicking FBI agent? Is it the script that sets up story lines and background and then ignores all the foundation it just established? Is it the direction that wants so badly to focus on the chases and shooting that he just gives up on coherence altogether? Whatever it is, the beginning and the rest of the movie are completely disconnected.We start out with Emily Blunt as a supposedly bad-ass FBI agent who's been""kicking in doors"" being asked to join a mysterious task force with no explanation and no reason for choosing her in particular. Fact is, she's just not convincing in the role. She seems way to fragile to support her back story. If they were looking for someone with her talents and skills, they never use any of them. If they were just looking for a patsy to take the fall, why pick a great agent instead of some dead wood from a back office? It makes no sense and just goes downhill from there.Our tough, professional heroine instantly turns into a wet dishrag and complete victim with no spine. She gets ignored, disrespected, beaten, shot and takes it all with a blank expression or simpering tears, but never does she do anything meaningful to change her situation. The rest of the cliched drug cartel story is the same stuff you see on any of the weekly cop shows, nothing new is added except a few extra on screen murders and some extra blood.Very glad I didn't pay to see this one, I only wasted 2 hours instead of a lot of cash."
" Intense
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,9,Let me preface this by saying I never write reviews. I am now writing after my 3rd play-through of this amazing movie!The suspense is non-stop and I mean non-stop. You know that feeling in your gut right before you start a roller-coaster ride? You feel that through this entire movie.Gripping movie man. Must watch!
" booooring
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,1,One of the stupid and boring movies that i ever saw
" Plenty of intensity, but less nuance
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,7,"Intensity? Check. Performances? Check. Nuance? Not so much. Granted, 2/3 ain't bad. This drug war movie was highly watchable. If ""traffic"" told, this film showed. And it captures the pointless anarchy of it all beautifully and suspensefully. But the characters felt like cardboard cutouts, and the morality a tad too cliche. Worth watching, but not re-watching."
" An interesting take on U.S's war on drugs
",2017-12-25 00:00:00,7,"In the lawless border area stretching between the U.S. and Mexico, an idealistic FBI agent (Emily Blunt) is enlisted to aid in the escalating war against drugs.Also starring, Josh Brolin, Daniel Kaluuya, Benicio Del Toro, Victor Garber, Jon Bernthal.""Sicario"" was the only movie in English directed by Denis Villeneuve that I hadn't seen yet. All five (including ""Prisoners"", ""Enemy"", ""Arrival"", ""Blade Runner 2049"") have been cult hits and among the most critically acclaimed screen works of given release year.Villeneuve's movies are emotionally distant, slow-burning, and usually more dependent on mood than sharp storytelling. I am not the fan of his style - it's too slow, rather uneventful, lacks sharp dialogue and character building - but I gotta admit that it always pays off.I could also say that ""Sicario"" doesn't really offer any intriguing characters except Del Toro's (good that he's gonna be back for sequel ""Soldado"") and the best drug war / trafficking stories are just more captivating (especially ""The Wire"" and ""Breaking Bad"")...But it doesn't change the fact that it's a solid thriller, and a cool movie which makes you gradually more and more thankful that you endured the rather slow first half."
" Sicario delivers.
",2017-12-25 00:00:00,7,"Here is a spoiler free review of Sicario (2015):Benecio Del Toro delivers HARD in this movie. The plot isn't too crazy and seems grounded enough for someone like me who has had experience in counter terror operations. It also isn't too far fetched. I know I know movies can be far fetched because they are just that. They are dealing with REAL bad guys and it's just another day. Emily Blunt plays her part beautifully and is in serious Synergy with Brolin and Del Toro. If you want to watch a movie that's not to over the top with bullets and has an actual story, watch Sicario. This film doesn't just put you on auto pilot it draws you in wanting more."
" im at a loss for words...
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,10,"Again, who are the people reviewing these movies? this is a solid flick. great action, very intense, and you cant help but respect the people who really fight this kind of crime on a day to day basis. I cant wait for the 2nd one coming out. 7.6? jurassic park is at 7.2?!? this is deff a 8-9 movie. watch it, thank me later."
" Hitchcock said:
",2017-12-18 00:00:00,8,"""You should start your film with an eartquake and then build up on that"". Sicario accomplishes that widely and althought its superb tension has been praised it is sometimes regarded as a minor achievement, as if films with this level of production value were a guarantee of thrill. That¬¥s just wrong. Denis Villeneuve is an outstanding director who should be granted a blank check for every movie he makes and this level of technical brilliance should be celebrated without reserves. Special mention to the superb soundtrack.In this case the only problem seems to be the story, the only possible way to pick on a Villeneuve¬¥s film. Apparently, it doesn¬¥t cover the intricate set of interests in the drug cartel. Now, how many movies, specially big ones, completely lose it precisely because of an over-sized ambition to explain everything? (I¬¥m not looking at anybody, Mr. Nolan). Sicario doesn¬¥t fall in that trap. It never tries to bite off more than it can chew and it succeeds at portraying a complicated matter the only possible way: narrowing the scope.The only thing that matters is Kate, Emily Blunt¬¥s character, on her way to ""finally understand"" the big picture. The first half of the film does a special good job at making the audience know as little as she does and although we may step out of her character a couple of times, it¬¥s only the bare minimum so we can get the big picture as well. Sicario is easily one of the best films of the decade. The film industry should work relentlessly to give this man great scripts, we don¬¥t want another ""Prisoners"", please."
" Unbelievably bad writing (spoiler alert)
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,1,"The cinematography is fine, but the story is the flimsiest of reeds to try and hang pretty video shots on. I give one glaring example, out of many that could be chosen.Early in the movie the good guys fly into Mexico secretly. At the end of the movie a huge deal is made of the same group sneaking into Mexico through a tunnel. No explanation of why they could not just fly in like they did before: the target was being tracked, no need for the lucky break to find a car on the Mexican side of the tunnel to be used to get to the target. How this ever got a 7.6 rating is beyond me."
" Pretty.... disappointing
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,2,"Yes there is much eye candy on show here with beautiful landscapes in between some nasty nasty men doing baaaad things to themselves and each other. Some kind of government people come along and talk amongst themselves then go and have a look but remember to bring along some heavies with guns just in case. Not only that their cars have really good suspension so bumps don't matter to their teeth or tools. Once they have had a good look around they go back to queue jumping... oh I missed a bit as they get to use the fancy firearms on some underwhelming locals for some reason. Meanwhile, a girl cop hides on the back seat looking bewildered but never mind the nice beefy men gather round to show how tough they are and she doesn't have to do anything.. then some other things happen involved underground shenanigans and bad stuff like drugs they shouldn't be having. Along the way there is some swearing and sweating maybe a little grunting but not really enough to fill 120 minutes of our time and attention. Poor little Ms Blunt getting hornswoggled into this disappointment... go watch Narcos or Escobar for some proper fun..."
" Confuse, Slow and with bad ending.
",2017-11-29 00:00:00,2,"The movie starts very good, giving a high expectation of action and drama, but then it suddenly gets too slow and boring, as well as very confuse. You soon may start to question what the ** is the movie about, just as the main characters question it themselves every 5 minutes. The ending is also really disappointing, sadly =/."
" Great performances elevate intriguing
",2017-11-19 00:00:00,9,"Sicario has been described as another crime drama based on the war of Mexico-USA border. Though, Sicario does many things well such as its storytelling and the overall plot. The film has a slow build up within its first hour but afterwards becomes very much quick paced and more intriguing and engaging. The performances from its leads is what elevates the film as it becomes a much more enjoyable and deserving watch. Especially by Benecio Del Toro as he steals his scenes within the second half. Josh Brolin plays his role well, as does Emily Blunt as the central character (although we can see as to why her character is considered the worst of the three).Sicario was not as big of a success at the box office (making $85 million on a $30 million budget) but since it has been praised from critics and fans, a sequel is on its way next year, as we expect bigger success than the original. As the film passes, it becomes more intense which is always a positive for thrillers. Although not many twists are included, the film becomes a much watch. Highly recommend.
As a rewatch 05/16/19' Sicario remains one of the finer drug cartel drama thrillers to date. Position stand by the characters, with Del Toro being the most intriguing character between him, Josh Brolin and Emily Blunt."
" Straight up incredible filmmaking.
",2017-11-03 00:00:00,10,"Almost every movie has one element of either its production or story that draws special attention away from everything else. Lord of the Rings' costume design, Jurassic Park's cutting-edge effects, the Sixth Sense's twist, Anton in No Country for Old Men etc. In Sicario, however, nothing stands out, but in the best way. Everything gels together, complimenting every aspect of the film. The characters are complex and rich with personality, the set design is a perfect recreation of the Mexican slums, the dialogue is natural, the cinematography by legend Roger Deakins is spectacular. I could honestly go on, but I'll end this by saying that Sicario is the most well-made film that anybody has bothered to make in the past decade. Definitely one to see."
" Not a Hollywood/American Morality Piece
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,8,"There are many reviews here that go over why Sicario is a good movie, and I agree with many of them for a variety of reasons, so I won't add to the pile of praise.And for the record, I will say that I don't think this movie is the best thing sliced bread by any means, but it is a solid film.What I will offer is a word to some of those that disliked the movie for reasons I actually find quite silly and misguided.However, before that I will point out that there are people who claim the movie didn't click with them for a variety of ""movie"" reasons, and it simply wasn't their thing. This is totally fine, of course, because every single person is entitled to their personal feelings of *enjoyment* of a movie.But what is objectively wrong is when critiques of this film are based on false pretenses and expectations. There are two very wrong critiques of this movie:1. The first set of critiques that are misguided are the ones that claim this movie has no real central plot or character development. They often frame their points by beating up Emily Blunt's character, and claiming how the plot built up but didn't real do much with itself at the end.This is simply not true. I will suggest that perhaps the frustration here for those who claim this is that they did not get to see a classic Hollywood morality tale when it comes to law enforcement. There was no central character, agency, or group who in the middle of this drug cartel mess are morally righteous or easy to side with. There wasn't even fully an anti-hero.This film explores the moral ambiguity of the USA/Mexico/Latin America drug cartel/war issues, and tops it off by making a clear point that this mess of moral ambiguity and cycle of violence MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE affects people who are innocent and never asked to be a part of the mess that is the drug trade/war.Just because the film mostly follows those involved with law enforcement in the U.S. doesn't mean that you should expect a clear-cut good vs. evil story, and that's exactly the way it is in real life.2. Another set of critiques levied against this movie centers around Emily Blunt's character being surrounded by a mess of people doing a bunch of violent things etc., and how her character seems to be caught in the middle of everything with no real capability to change the events and outcomes around her.These critiques go further to explain how the movie portrays law enforcement in the drug war as an arena of violence with a bunch of higher-ups running around calling the shots, while underlings carrying out the dirty work on both sides without really having an authority on the outcome of their situation.I would invite anyone who feels they agree with that ""critique"" of the film after watching the movie to really re-read the two paragraphs I wrote above and decide if that's an accurate representation of the drug war or not. If you're expecting a movie like this to reflect the ""reality"" of the drug war by serving up a John Wayne type character taking heroic and full control of a dangerous situation and solving the problems of the world, then I would sincerely suggest that you ask yourself if you have a realistic view on the drug war itself.After all is said and done, Sicario, isn't a good vs. evil movie about the drug war, nor is it an action-thriller about law enforcement and the drug war.This movie is about the wandering and hopeless feeling that ongoing violence creates, regardless of who is involved. It is accented by the point that getting involved in these situations (no matter the side you're on) requires you to sacrifice what you think is right or wrong to a degree, and reminds you of the terribly unfortunate human collateral damage caused by the ongoing cycle of the drug war‚Äîboth physical and spiritual."
" successful
",2017-10-26 00:00:00,8,"It is a very high-quality film that shows how the American state is doing a lot of dirty work, the techniques it uses are mostly out of compliance with the law, but it is very clear how it was adapted. The issues we are not strangers actually. Players, shootings, music, thrill ... everything is perfect. A lot of things do not watch."
" A Really Well Crafted Thriller, With One of the Most Interesting Directors
",2017-10-23 00:00:00,9,"Denis Villenueve is slowly becoming one of my favorite directors nowadays. He usually creates great movies, with great atmospheres, with gorgeous visuals and a fantastic cast. This are his main trademarks.Sicario is about a group of agents and police men of the USA government who are trying to stop the horrible things that are happening because of the drug cartel in the frontier between USA and Mexico. The story is not that original, I think, but what is great about this movie is that it takes a simple story and tells us that story in an original and fascinating way. I was staring at the screen for a really big part of the movie, watching the amazing cinematography, the tense moments and the fantastic cast.The main character is Kate and FBI agent played wonderfully by Emily Blunt. She is the character who introduces us to the story, and with her facial expressions she is able to transport us to the dark and gritty world of the drug traffic. But she is not the only one who delivers. Josh Brolin also creates a really good character, charismatic but also enigmatic, but the true star of the show is, without a doubt, Benicio del Toro. He is the most enigmatic character, the one that says the least, and the one that you really want to know more about. He is fantastic in the role and I think he won a really deserved Oscar in the supporting role category.The problem (not big, but still a problem) I have with this movie, and that's why not the 10 stars rating, is the role of the friend of Kate, that I don't really feel he adds anything to the story, more than some moments of friendship between them. And also, there were some moments around the middle of the movie, that I felt a bit slow, and almost unnecessary, but maybe it's a bit of nitpicking on my side.Apart from that the movie really keeps you on the edge, but with no need of explosions or car chases. Just with the visuals, you are stuck. That is because of the amazing directing by Villenueve, that keeps you in tension in each scene, with the help of the wonderful Roger Deakins, who is able to keep all the shots interesting and beautiful, transmitting you the tension even in a just talking scene. Also, I need to mention the hypnotic score by Johan Johannsson, who add a lot to the building tension of the movie.Definitely a must see to the cinema lovers, to the lovers of Villenueve, and to everyone who wants a good story told in an amazing and fascinating way."
" Holy F@$# the Modern Western is Alive!!!
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,10,"First of all, this cast is brilliant, period. Everyone nails their roles and Benicio Del Toro, Josh Brolin, and Emily Blunt are just amazing.That said, let's be sure about one thing, this movie is a modern Western. If you love a good old days of shoot 'em up for revenge type of flick, a la Clint Eastwood style movie, you are in for a treat. Granted this is not the good ol' west, this the modern day version and holy cow does it deliver.I'm trying to find a reason to not give it a 10, but I can't."
" Lots of gritty realism
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,6,"SICARIO is an intense and gritty drug war thriller that follows an FBI agent as she teams up with some DEA agents to wage war on drug gangs in south-of-the-border Mexico. It's a film that features oodles of gritty realism, along with graphic depictions of violence and the like, much like Denis Villeneuve's previous movie PRISONERS. The grand, epic-style action sequences that fuel SICARIO make it a superior film to that, although I still found it a little lacking.Despite the length of the film and the big speeches and the like, the story actually turns out to be very simplistic and little different from the story lines in an average low rent action flick. I'm no fan of Emily Blunt, aside from her role in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, and as in LOOPER she feels out of place here. Luckily you get veteran genre actors like Benicio Del Toro to balance things out a bit. Some of the establishing shots, like of the convoy of soldiers riding through the streets of Mexico, are quite breathtaking, and the film has an excellent soundtrack that adds plenty of suspense to the proceedings. Overall, I did find it all a little hollow though."
" Irresponsible in the way it depicts sicarios and drug war violence
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,6,"This movie gets way too much hype for the fantasy that it actually is. The vast majority of murders and kidnappings in the Mexico cartel wars are carried out by males in their 20s and in mostly amateur fashion. The depiction of the Super Sicario here is pure Hollywood. The idea of a Super Sicario who expertly hunts down American agents and moves within their ranks is absolutely ridiculous. Also, the idea that there are delta force (type) raids and assassinations going on with U.S. military or covert assets is simply not accurate. When a Mexican cartel boss or lieutenant is brought down in real life, it's generally in boring fashion while they hide in a hotel room or get involved in a shootout with a rival cartel. Finally, illegal practices such as torture are glamorized and depicted as effective, when all real-world intel gathering professionals will tell you otherwise. Cross border tunnel raids in which dozens are killed is just the icing on the Hollywood cake. In any case, this is obviously fiction and the film does try to depict the nebulous nature of the war on drugs near the U.S.-Mexico border. The story is taut and very well directed by Villeneuve. The film does not take a stand on one side or the other - the drug trade and all the violence that it entails, especially in the 2000's, is the direct result of American demand for the product. Further, the movie attempts to demonstrate that the volume of drugs passing through (or under) our border crossings simply would not be possible without massive corruption on both sides. All in all I was disappointed because I am very familiar with the areas in which it was set and the U.S-Mexico dialectic concerning the war on (some) drugs and horrific cartel violence in Juarez, MX. I thought that while the direction was more than competent, it wasn't Villeneuve's best work and that Taylor Sheridan took way too much creative license and that the end result was a highly stylized flick that doesn't capture the boring and even more horrifying aspects of the situation in Mexico. I suppose my main problem with the movie, however, was the idea of a super assassin and that it depicts the U.S. as way more interested in what is going on down there than it actually is."
" What's it all about?
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,5,"Emily Blunt is kept in the dark... so are we. Very very weak reasons for her entanglement in this drug cartel movie. 6 American SUV's barrelling down the Juarez highway in a super- coordinated prisoner pickup, and then that convoy being held up by a vehicle broken down in the border line up is a bit hard to believe. But .. it's great scenery and it does have Josh Brolin in it so it must be good,right?Well let's put it this way, he's good because he slots into these type of roles easily and pulls it off. The movie is well shot and is a typical portrayal of the American perception of the best way to deal with those nasty purveyors of pollution. Shoot'em dead with no mercy is their answer and so they happily employ goons and psychos to slaughter people in the mistaken belief that the more you get rid of, the less there are to deal with.It's like stamping on ants at the entrance to their nest! In my innocent mind and in my little world, in my little circle of friends, I don't know any drug takers or dealers and the problem I have with the theme of this movie is the level of society's resources committed to stamp out the use of narcotics by maybe 3% of the population. Blowing the suppliers to smithereens doesn't make one iota of difference to the production line, it makes for good movie scenes, it makes for rough justice but it doesn't solve any problems at all. Even with these prejudices I got absorbed by Del Toro's ruthless character, I wasn't that impressed by Emily Blunt and it seemed to me that she spent most of the movie with her mouth open, gobsmacked by the stuff unfolding in front of her, not much in the way of building any empathy. I still can't get over the way these goons and thugs (the good guys I might add) wander into buildings , flit round a corner and think they're safe with a gun in their hand, I suppose it's necessary theatre but it's really stupid . To sum up , I was disappointed with a lazy script and a sub par performance from the cast, the scenery constantly outshines the rest of the project."
" Crosses the tour-De-force border of film-making
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,10,"'Sicario' had me stoked from the start. It is hard to go wrong with the involvement of cinematographer Roger Deakins, director Denis Villeneuve, writer Taylor Sheridan, advertising that really makes one want to see the film, its critical acclaim and a cast like Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro.In no way was 'Sicario' a let down. It completely lived up to the hype and all of the attractions/reasons for seeing the film were among the things that made 'Sicario' so good. 'Sicario' to me really is one of the best films of 2015, one of the best crime thriller films in years and a standout film of the decade. Its one stumbling block was that more could have been done with the character of Kate, the character and her motivations seemed a little underwritten somewhat and not always as decisive or plausible as ought. However, it was nowhere near as big a problem as made out (also was completely masked by how brilliant the rest of the film was), because it was clear that she was meant to be something of a fish out of water character and that was brought out very well, meaning that to me some of her actions made sense somewhat.Everything about the film in general is brilliant and a tour-De-force of film-making, though it is understandable if it doesn't connect with all. 'Sicario' is impeccably made for starters, the setting is both audacious and visceral in showing the horrors and brutality of the setting and the editing is tight, stylish and enhances the brutal atmosphere. Best of all is the cinematography (in close competition in that year's Oscar category with 'The Revenant, which was a deserved winner), with Roger Deakins demonstrating once again why he is one of the best contemporary cinematographers in the business with cinematography that's stunning and darkly gritty, also bringing out the visceral horror.Denis Villeneuve's directing has a beautiful darkness but also a hard edge that is perfect for the story that 'Sicario' tries to tell. The music score is haunting and pulse-pulsating, one can actually feel their heart beat with tension and anticipation. Can totally see why it was nominated for the Oscar and an easy second to Ennio Morricone's work for 'The Hateful Eight'. Can also see the acclaim for the sound editing, which added a huge amount to the film's authenticity, again up against tight competition in the category that year at the Oscars.The script is tightly structured and rich in complexity, while the story doesn't need attention-grabbing set pieces to impress or make its point and has more than that on its mind. And all the better for it. It is heavily reliant on atmosphere, this is brutal, harrowing stuff that effectively shows the horrors of the situation and setting without overdoing or sugar-coating it, also showing respect to it. It's wonderfully murky and dark, while also taut and kinetic in its energy (despite the sometimes deliberate, but never dull, pacing).You couldn't have gotten better performances. The standout is Benicio Del Toro, with the most interesting character (especially in the genuinely shocking final act) and giving a magnificently shady performance that's chilling but also conflicted. Emily Blunt conveys great strength and touching vulnerability, while Josh Brolin is tongue-in-cheek and charming with a touch of ambiguity. Daniel Kaluuya is sort of a moral compass character, something that Kaluuya is movingly sympathetic bringing out.Overall, a masterpiece tour-De-force with only one minor and ignorable stumbling block. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
" Outstanding!
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,10,"(Flash Review)The topic is pretty typical with a highly skilled special opts team infiltrates the Mexico drug world to reach up the drug lord ladder to take down a top dog. Very reminiscent of Traffic. Production value: High quality, gritty and real.Editing: Crisp and communicativeCinematography: Told the story without dialog or complimented the tone of the scene. Script: Told just enough without embellishment and left just enough for the viewer to use their minds to complete the scene.Music Score: Wow. It really was unique, effective and powerful. Often it was the invisible character in the scene. Plot: Developed, changed and twisted as the film progressed.Scene transitions: Some were very effective, abstracted and unique and some were stunning. One great shot of an all-black SUV convoy, viewed from an aerial shot, was flatted to the point that they began to take form of a snake weaving through traffic and the streets. Overall: the film kept me fully engrossed from the first frame to the last and a couple times in between my mouth was agape with shock."
" this, a drama film. no thriller
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,1,"I didn't bother watching the whole movie. instead I read some bad reviews here, and it just confirmed everything I thought. In the beginning, there is some action, for a few minutes. then the main character volunteers for a job, but she does't get any info. that means the viewers don't know what's going on either, and it drags on. they drive into a Mexican city and they don't cut, we have to watch them driving all the way. and since no one knows whats going on, it's completely unnecessary. Emily Blunt gives a bad performance, but it's not her fault. The character is just a terribly written coward, in a male dominated sexist environment. What's the point of a movie that does not reveal anything about the plot in the first 45 minutes???I guess it's supposed to be a tense feeling about it, and artsy, complete fail."
" ""Nothing will make sense to your American ears and you will question everything we do, but in the end you will understand""
",2017-08-18 00:00:00,9,"That quote is one of the things Alejendro (Benicio Del Toro's character) says to Kate Macer (Emily Blunt's character) at the beginning of the film and it really sums up this film perfectly as the viewer is basically in the same position as Kate in regards to understanding what is going on in this film and as a result, you really do question everything that is going on and you really don't understand everything until the end. Honestly, this is one of the best drug related movies I have seen in a very long time!!I don't want to give any spoilers away as to do so would be a crime to the people that haven't seen this film yet. Its got an absolutely fantastic script and the directing and cinematography are both absolutely off the hook brilliant. One of the things that stood out the most for me was just how amazing the control of tension was in this film. There is a scene in the beginning where the team crosses over to Juarez Mexico to pick up a high level drug detainee and brings him back across to the US. It was roughly 10-15 minutes of the movie and the tension in that scene just builds and builds throughout the entire scene. It was just a masterfully crafted sequence of the film, in every single aspect of film making, and the film only gets better and better from there. The cinematography in general was just absolutely brilliant throughout the entire film. The car scene I just mentioned in the beginning, the amazing aerial photography shot on the border and in the city of Juarez, and in particular the use of satellite imagery, drone imagery, and the use of night vision photography towards the end of the film. They even use security camera footage. Its just a masterful blending of a whole slew of different photographic tools and styles and it really helps give the film a sense of realism and really helps put you in the shoes of Kate and the team. I'm a professional photographer so I tend to focus on cinematography more than your average film goer, but this cinematography is so well done that I think most movie goers that appreciate a beautifully shot film will be talking about just how amazing this aspect of this film was when the credits start rolling. And the casting is just top notch. Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, and Benicio Del Toro all give top notch performances. Benicio Del Toro's performance is definitely the best of the 3, but that's mostly because his character was the most interesting of the 3. There is a lot of mystery and intrigue behind his character and you don't find out the real story behind Alejando until the end of the film and Del Toro does a brilliant job with the role. You can see Kate trying to figure out just who Alejendro is from the very beginning of the film and were only given small bits of information on his character as the film goes on. One of my favorite aspects of Josh Brolin's character, Matt Graver, was just how much he enjoys sticking it to the bad guys. He is a man that truly loves what he is doing and you see him smiling in many scenes where most people wouldn't be. And Emily Blunt definitely holds her own. All 3 play off each other really well and the result is one of the best acted films I have seen in awhile.If there was one weakness in regards to the casting it was with Kate's partner Reggie. Its not that he did a bad job, its just everyone else did such an amazing job that his character just doesn't hold up and feels kinda boring. Fortunately, even when he is there, the focus is usually on one of the other team members so his performance really doesn't hurt the film at all. Again, his performance just wasn't up to par with the rest of the performances in the film. All in all, Sicario is just a brilliant film. It has a fantastic script, great casting, top notch performances, and some of the best cinematography I have seen in some time. It has action, tension, intrigue, and it has some great twists and a great ending. Ultimately, this film was a very different take on the whole ""war on drugs"" genre of films. Definitely a solid 9/10 for me!!"
" Best movie of 2015, period!
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,10,"Sicario is so deep, so dark and so real. The performances from Del Toro, Brolin, Blunt and Bernthal made it so real that we really get out of the theater thinking about all of it. Thinking about the daily life of people on the other side of the border, the life of people that dedicated their lives fighting the war on drugs, and the people that are actually willing to sacrifice themselves to change anything. This is The Movie of 2015. This movie deserved tons of Oscars. Bravo Denis Villeneuve. Bravo J√≥hann J√≥hannsson. Waiting for Soldado although I think that the current movie is already a true masterpiece that will live on for many years to come. Let's hope that Soldado is as good as Sicario even without Blunt."
" A good suspenseful thriller
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,7,"I have now finished my Dennis Villeneuve series with sicario, and I liked this film even though I think it is a little bit overrated. The premise of this film sees a FBI agent sent to a new task force to go after the cartels in Mexico. Emily blunt plays the lead in this film and she is great in the role, she is a strong female character but also portrays her vulnerability really well to make you truly care about her character. For the majority of the film you see this situation from her viewpoint and it causes you to root for her even more. The best part of this film has to be the performance of benicio del torro, he is easily the best character in this film. As you see his character develop throughout the film you become more and more interested in his journey during the film. Josh brolin plays the head of the task force in this film and he is a complex character as you try and see where his character is coming from. Victor Garber, Jon bernthal and Daniel kaluuya are also really good in there smaller roles. The story is interesting seeing these different people trying to deal with this crime in different ways some making unique moral decisions. But even though it is my favourite part of the movie the 3rd act is really bizarre as it shifts focus from blunt to del torro and it makes a weird ending. The script has some good dramatic dialogue in it but not a lot that stands out also the humour doesn't really work in this movie when used. The style of the film though is beautiful, the cinematography is terrific making this film a visual marvel to watch. But this film suffers from some real pacing issues that hurt its overall viewing pleasure as it trundles along at times. Overall I liked sicario and I think that if you are a fan of cartel thrillers then this is definitely a film for you."
" Dark, Brutal, and Benicio Del Toro
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,8,"One of those rare movies when the flagship star is completely sidelined by veteran steamrollers. Like a dark cloud getting lost in the afterglow of the silver-lining.I am not an American, but I could see some political undertones in this movie, and I cannot comment on it. As an uninformed viewer, I tend to agree with most of the reviewers here in that this movie is fantastic.It is one of those subtle, insidious thrillers that take you to the edge of your seat without you even realising it. I watched it on a lazy Sunday evening, and despite the cold rainy weather, I suddenly became part of a delta team that was undertaking a covert operation.The best part about the movie is that it does not rely on 'blockbuster' action sequences. It banks on the human element, and it pays off in the most consummate of ways.Despite the presence of Emily Blunt, who did a blisteringly good job, the movie rides on the very able, intense shoulders of the Bull, egged on by the staggeringly awesome tongue-in cheekily serious performance of Josh Brolin.This is one movie you ought to watch!"
" Moral dilemmas abound in 'Sicario'
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,7,"The Mexican drug cartels that are responsible for a large part of drug trafficking across the United States' southern border and the FBI that is responsible for pursuing them are front and center in Denis Villeneuve's thriller 'Sicario.' The cat-and-mouse chase that is widely known by many but understood by few makes for an interesting plot, but it's really the politics, red tape and difficult decisions that need to be made that are explored in the film.In 'Sicario,' an up-and-coming FBI agent named Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is summoned to support a multi-agency effort to weed out a kingpin drug lord on the El Jason border - an effort led by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and a chameleonesque Mexican agent played by Benicio Del Toro. As the sting gets underway, Macer quickly learns things are not quite how they appear on the surface, and through the process she is tasked with acting on her principles or what others believe is the appropriate thing to do. This set of moral dilemmas is what increases the interest level in 'Sicario,' rather than the action sequences that dominate the screen time.The film's strengths are namely the screenplay, cinematography (including earning an Academy Award nomination) and acting performances, particularly when it comes to Blunt, Brolin and Del Toro. The tug-of-war between the dueling priorities among the U.S. team's side makes for an exciting premise from an acting standpoint, as there is a lot of tough talk and tense situations that must be navigated. There are plenty of twists and turns before we get to the climax, and it's fair to say the resolution will leave many questions among audiences.'Sicario' is the kind of thriller that will fly under the radar but still be held in high regard among fans of the genre."
" Action + Very well directed Suspense
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,9,"Sicario is a movie Directed by Denis Villeneuve the same director and writer associated with the new and amazing revelation of 2016 Arrival. The first thing we have to keep in mind is how deep the characters are, and how well portrayed. Emily Blunt translates this action movie into a personal drama making every second of it agonizing and pretty emotional. Benicio Del Toro represents the opposite, Ice cold murderer with a very justifiable goal. Amazing pace and incredible end."
" Very smartly written, excellent audio, fantastic ride into another world.
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,9,"SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSHave yet to see over the decades whether it ranks up there with Luc Besson's Leon for re-watchability, smart writing, excellent story telling and characterization, but Sicario has been one movie I've re-watched happily several times because of all this.The brilliant cinematography manages to make a typical 'soldier movie' very unnerving and dynamic. You don't feel a static moment in the entire movie and it just rockets from start to finish with unrelenting inevitability for the main hero.Because the story isn't a 'standard' war movie, it allows for the hero to feel uncomfortable and uneasy throughout, and that's further brought up by the excellent audio and music mix that accompanies it. It's one of the cases where the audio really does heighten the tension, and adds much more to the cinematography.Without relying on tons of special effects due to the smaller budget also gives this movie a far more 'real' feel than the latest 'Battleship' and such because everyone's forced to work on location rather than green-screened. Multi-dimensional story, characters with good conflicts in difficult situations, and the feel that everything is constantly out of balance.Wonderful, worth watching in the theater and the BluRay buy. Really wish they had a 4k special edition with tons more behind the scenes, etc!"
" Great actors, terrible movie
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,1,"I watched this movie because of the excellent reviews and riveting trailer. Unfortunately, watching it was a big mistake. Instead of the lead character, Emily Blunt, making thoughtful (or even halfway reasonable) decisions, she repeatedly chooses to do things that leave the end feeling completely empty. This is not a movie without sequences of intense action, and if that is all you look for in a movie -- rest assured, you will find that and more with Sicario. However, if you want a logically coherent main character who isn't a bumbling idiot, a plot with more than a cursory explanation at the end, and in general some closure, you will not be happy with this movie. At the end it was incredibly hard not to be frustrated with the decisions of the main character. This boring story of revenge with nobody having the guts to make a good decision was, quite frankly, disgusting."
" Lacks a lot but still good.
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,8,"All criticism about Blunt's role, the superficial script, and the lack of a thrilling story are true but the movie is so well recorded that you don't realize them till the day after you watched it. You will say ""Wow! What a good movie that was?"" after you are finished with the movie. I think that is the important thing with a movie. Yes, it would be much better if Blunt's character hadn't ever existed in the story and plot focused on the Del Toro's character and went a little deeper into his story but I didn't think of it while watching. So, it's worth watching and very enjoyable."
" Completely Plot-less
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,3,"That movie was a thorough disappointment. One could think than in 2 hours you just HAVE to have some plot to put all the visuals together. But not here. Director uses dialogue only when absolutely needed, so plot is almost non-existent. We get stunning visuals and interesting locations, but it's like watching bizarre video-clip. For the whole movie I questioned motivations of main characters. (major spoilers ahead) Even first scene raised my eyebrows, when our agents find dozens of bodies hidden behind the dry-walls in a safe house. Let that stink sink for a moment... Dozens of decaying bodies in apparently occupied safe house. Why? Does the great boss like to torture his soldiers with stink? Does he fell awkward digging holes so he went with vertical storage instead? Or maybe it's just poor plot-vehicle to show our agent is angry enough and ready to go after big bad guy? DING DING DING So Kate joins the group and guess what they do next? They exfiltrate local gang boss... from a Mexico. Because Freedom goes wherever it wants to go. Not only that but they kill some gang members right on a crowded highway just before border. Just a normal day at work I guess. Kate (our main character) doesn't like it, but hey - they are big boys and she wants to be a big boy too. Why do they choose to torture local boss on American soil and prepare risky convoy ride instead of going by helicopter? Because (redacted), that's why. I don't want to go further, but every part of the movie is filled with stupid, inconsistent decisions that do not make any sense at all. If National Geographic went to document lives of narco bosses - it would be just like this movie. Chaotic, brutal and completely plot-less. The movie ends where it started - NOWHERE."
" A tense look at the drugs war on America's southern border
",2017-05-31 00:00:00,9,"Kate Macer is an FBI agent who is part of an anti-kidnap squad but after taking part in a raid that leads to the discovery of dozens of bodies, victims of a drug cartel, she finds herself seconded to a specialist task force that is targeting the cartel. This task force is led Matt Graver, a CIA operative and includes Alejandro Gillick, a Mexican former prosecutor with shadowy motives, and several members of Special Forces. She quickly starts to wonder what she has got herself into. On her first day they cross into Mexico to extradite a senior cartel member; an operation that ends with a shootout on a highway just north of the border. This man gives information that leads to the location of a cartel tunnel under the border as well as cartel bank accounts. The real plan then becomes clear; the hope is that by creating such chaos for the cartels will recall their senior man in the US and he can be tracked to the cartel's leader.This is a tense thriller that had me gripped from start to finish; it is not a feel-good film though. Apart from Agent Macer and her FBI partner there are no really good characters; Graver and Gillick are morally questionable as it emerges that Macer is only really there to rubber stamp operations that would otherwise be illegal. This doesn't mean we can't sympathise with them as we see the brutality of the cartels¬Ö the sight of numerous bodies hidden in the walls of a house and hanging from a bridge in Ju√°rez is quite disturbing. The action is restricted to a few brief moments but when it happens it is sudden, intense and feels real. The cast to a great job; Emily Blunt is a convincing lead as Kate Macer and Josh Brolin impresses as Graver however it is Benicio del Toro who stands out as Gillick, a character who's loyalty is far from obvious. Director Denis Villeneuve does a fine job making it all feel very real. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody who wants a really tense thriller without a blank and white morality."
" Dreary movie that falls flat and wastes talent
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,5,"Dreary is the best word that comes to mind if I had to pick one to describe SicarioDramatically uninvolving, sluggishly paced, and poorly acted, Sicario gives us a sample of the Federal Bureau's war on drugs with Mexico without illuminating anything about the people involved that makes it a story worth telling.Emily Blunt is massively underwhelming in the main role. She goes through the motions with no motivation other than doing the scripts bidding, and she lacks the fortitude needed to be a convincing FBI agent.Director Denis Villeneuvre was a small Quebecois director who has, in relatively short time, found his way into Hollywood. It is truly a remarkable achievement because he does not make loud or bright movies, his movies are very quiet. His approach was better suited to his last film Prisoners (which resembled se7en) but in Sicario he fails to channel the same level of ominous and suspense that made you hold your breath at times. Aside from some spectacular aerial shots Sicario is Visually uninteresting, bland and dramatically empty."
" Lost War on Drugs
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,9,"Dennis Villeneuve is one of the best directing talents in recent times, has proved it with Prisoners and Enemy, this one is a more mainstream effort from him. The so called War on Drugs as one knows has been a long drawn out affair,that has cost billions of dollars, countless lives and has not seen any resolution to yet. And I doubt it will. For the last 4 years or so,Mexico has turned into a war zone of sorts, with daily battles between the entrenched drug cartels and the Government. A dirty battle, marked by unprecedented viciousness, cruelty, and which really has seen no winners at all.And I guess that is the best part of Sicario, it treads into the grey zone, there are no heroes in this war. Both the sides play it equally dirty, throwing all rules and ethics out of the window. As the idealistic Fed agent Kate Macer( Emily Blunt) discovers , when her boss tells her bluntly, the boundaries have expanded, and there is no question of operating outside them now. In a sense Kate undergoes a loss of innocence, as she watches her colleague, a Dept of Defense adviser Matt( Josh Brolin), and his mysterious partner Alejandro( Benicio Del Toro), break every rule in the book. She seems to be the odd one out in a dirty and ruthless world, where no one is what it seems.One of the most shocking opening scenes ever, where the raiding party, discovers a home stuffed with caracasses in the wall and rigged with explosives. You know this is not going to be your conventional popcorn action flick. The pacing is slow, and the tension is more like a slow poison sort, that envelops you steadily. The violence is brutal and realistic, it just makes you squirm, you are thankful that you are not there. One particularly brilliant scene, when the Agents intercept the cartel men in a traffic jam near the border, the way Villeneueve builds up the tension here is superb. The movie sticks to the point, and at no stage is the focus diverted. The tension is relentlessly drilled into your head, until it overwhelms you.The camera work is outstanding, the desert scenes, the aerial shots of the border towns, are so brilliantly shot, as well as the scene where they go into the tunnel. Add to it, the movie is marked by some top notch performances. Emily Blunt is first rate as the idealistic Fed agent, who has a rude awakening to reality. Josh Brolin as the street smart DOD agent, who would do anything to get to his target is great as usual. And it is good to see Benicio Del Toro, back in a real meaty role, as Brolin's partner, who seemingly has a lot to hide. Here is my recommendation, Go for it."
" Silly
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,4,"This movie starts off ridiculous. First of all, the title. Somebody probably learned a new Spanish word and thought it would be cool to use it as the title of a movie. The only problem is that this movie does not involve a sicario. There's no sicario in this movie. A sicario is a hit man. It's that simple. You pay someone money, and then they kill someone for you.This movie is about a lawyer who is seeking revenge against a drug dealer for the murder of his family. He doesn't hire a hit man. He does it himself.This is your typical tough guy/gal movie. Middle class people who attended schools for the performing arts dress up in flak jackets and pretend to shoot weapons. It's like watching little boys play cops and robbers.A Big Yawner"
" Well made but ultimately reactionary and pointless
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,5,"I was really excited about Sicario after being a big fan of Prisoners and other films by Denis Villeneuve. However while I enjoyed certain sequences of the film, I have to say that overall it was a disappointing experience. I guess what bothered me the most about the film was that it seemed very misogynistic to me. Emily Blunt is established as this tough female character in the first scene but then for the remainder of the film she's stuck as a fragile woman in distress. The way the film piled humiliation upon humiliation on her character started to feel increasingly predictable and almost sadistic. Some reviews seemed to suggest that this was to show the corruption of the system and the impossibility of a truly good character (ie:Blunt) making a positive change. Yet, Benicio Del Toro's character is given the opportunity to have a riveting action sequence and Blunt's character seems sidelined. I liked the soundtrack and a few of the sequences were well-directed and riveting. But the only message I could get from the film was a kind of might makes right viewpoint."
" Benicio is the star
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,9,"He is brilliant in this movie.Emily, as always, is horrible. How she gets work is mind-boggling. I guess whenever Hollywood needs an unattractive, shrill, entitled actress, they can turn to her.Josh Brolin ain't bad, but this movie is a showcase for BDT and boy does he deliver. He is a gem in a Hollywood filled with hacks and duds.The movie deals with the reality and the geopolitics of two borderless countries with different ideals and priorities.There's plenty of intrigue with just the right amount of action. It has an intelligent and brutally honest script. It deals with narcoterrorism and the feckless way the USA and Mexico deal with it.It also delves into the internal politics that govern both countries law enforcement establishment. I want to compare it to ""Blow"" and ""Traffic"", but it is honestly better than those two movies. And I thought those two moves were great, so that should tell you how good this movie is."
" A Emotional Violence ""Sicario""
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,8,"It is a terrific emotional violence,Sicario is not a movie what are you expected for, its all about what are you looking for a long time. it is really rare that you fell sorry for the BAD guys and happy for the fiendish one!and the background music will give you extra hype for next scene!"
" Cinematically charged social drama
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,8,"Whether it's the limitless expanse of the Desert Southwest or the danger-filled streets of Ciudad Juarez as captured by cinematographer Roger Deakins, ""Sicario"" is a film utterly attuned to the drama of its spaces - especially when, within those spaces, there is occurring an intractable drug war that threatens to lay waste to the land and the people on both sides of the U.S./Mexico border. Directed with brio and style and an unerring instinct for visual impact by Denis Villeneuve, ""Sicario"" stars Emily Blunt and Daniel Kaluuya as two FBI agents brought in to lend ""legitimacy"" to a shady CIA operation headed by Josh Brolin. The ostensible goal is to bring the head of a Mexican drug cartel to justice, but could there be another, more personal reason for the mission - and exactly how far should two federal officers, sworn to uphold the law, be willing to go in overlooking some of the questionable means being used to achieve that end?The screenplay by Taylor Sheridan takes us to a dimly-lit world of bloody cartels and government malfeasance where morality is murky and all sorts of ethical lines are crossed in pursuit of some larger goal - be it ""justice"" in a cosmic sense or just plain revenge for a wrong done and a personal loss suffered. Sheridan keeps not only Blunt and Kaluuya's characters in the dark much of the time but the audience as well, generating and sustaining an air of mystery and heightening the suspense.""Sicario"" features excellent performances from its cast, with a special shout-out to Benicio del Toro as an enigmatic, shadowy figure whose role in the proceedings is initially unclear but who steps forward, in sometimes shocking ways, as a major player in the series of events as they play themselves out.""Sicario"" is rare among American movies in that it refuses to provide the kind of neatly packaged conclusion we've come to expect from commercial enterprises, choosing instead to show that there are no easy solutions to complex problems and no happy endings for anyone involved in the messy, violent business we euphemistically call ""the war on drugs."""
" This is a very bad film overall that somehow has great reviews.
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,2,"Why does this movie have such high reviews? Good acting and bad everything else. The trailer made it seem like an action movie, it is not. The music makes it seem like a good drama, it is not. What it is? Very boring. I considered turning it off half way through but decided to tough it out in hopes it would get better, it did not. Ignore the good reviews and move on with your life. You could not pay me to watch this movie again."
" Overrated
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,6,"Unfortunately, I can't share the enthusiasm with which some others here review this movie. While I do agree that the plot-line is quite clever and that you don't really guess what will be revealed in the end, there are mainly two major issues that kind of ruined the film for me.The first thing is that I find the characters quite unbelievable. With the exception of Benicio del Toro maybe, all of the characters remain flat. There is an agent that is supposed to carry out the toughest missions and worst crimes imaginable, that is, apart from all moral doubts, close to tears for literally all of the movie. I don't think that a person with her characterization would have ever gotten into such a position. On the other end of course, the tough experienced fighter, who sleeps in the plane and wears flip flops at work, not caring of anything because he is way above it all. I really don't get what is so hard about creating believable characters. Those are definitely not.The second is that this is again America over everything. Maybe not concerning the moral but apart from that there are the American Super-Forces who show the simple people in Mexico how to do the job.All in all, those two points drew my attention away from the plot so much that I couldn't really enjoy the good sides, that definitely are there. Shortly said: This is not a Don't-watch but it's, and here I disagree, one of the best movies of any year."
" Sicario Has Style But Has It Intelligence?
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,6,"The introduction for this film gave initial promise by shrewdly adding a title that states: Sicario were early warriors of Jerusalem who hunted down Roman invaders, but then goes on to tell us Sicario: also means Hit-Man in Mexican (doesn't leave much to aspire to). It's a studied exercise in the ugliness of today's drug trade ‚Äì its main claim to fame lies in its overall style, both visual and directorial. Denis Villeneuvie's direction is taut (reminiscent in style to the interesting John Guillermin from the mid 50s ‚Äì late 80s). Much of Sicario's success at seducing the audience to overlook several plot implausibility's is gained from the superb work of British cinematographer/cameraman Roger Deakins. This brilliant director of photography is worthy of higher projects to better use his considerable talents. It would have been interesting to have had the opportunity for him work with the likes of David Lean or Carol Reed. To date, perhaps the most intelligent use of his talent may have been ""Defence of the Realm"" in '85 ‚Äì with possibly the most stylish being ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" in '94. I credit this fellow with adding much to the success of Cohen Bros movies than perhaps the often overrated Cohens themselves. There's also an evocative 'soundscape' score by Icelandic artist Johann Johannsson to help it along. As for the screenplay by TV actor Taylor Sheridan - it adds little new ground to a heavily pre-trodden scenario and if not for the combination of smart direction, photography and slick editing its many plot deficiencies would be even more self evident. If modern movies are going to set themselves up as realistically true to life, then there has to be a greater level of believability, otherwise they remain simply the 'artificial recreations of reality' they always have been ‚Äì except now of course, they just have to be overloaded with all the vile language and grotesque violent details that can be crammed into an average two hour plot. This work also has the feel of many TV series that stretch-out thin plots to fill endless episodes. Thankfully this is all over in two hours. Sheridan's characters are mostly made up of so-called 'elite' professionals - lead by an idealistic female SWAT team member played by Emily Blunt (who holds her implausible character quite well) but, for high profile professionals they tend to make so many foolish decisions ‚Äì Not to mention the many silly plot set-ups:(some minor spoilers here if not already seen) Sequences such as the corrupt policeman who just happened to be in an obscure roadside bar that is 'randomly' visited (totally without plan) by our heroine - coupled with the sudden appearance of her 'protector' are just too much to overlook. To top it off the Del Toro character's involvement is reduced down to just another clich√©d 'revenge' plot ‚Äì complete with his being able to gain access to one of the biggest players in the business by single-handily murdering all the personal protectors (who just happen to be in earshot of his victims but miraculously no-one hears anything) its just another of many stretches of credibility (like Kate's ex-SWAT partner who just happens to always be there, despite being previously rejected by the current government undercover team). There's also an ugly start to this folly with drug dealers hiding numerous badly decomposing bodies in the plaster wall cavities of a house. What possible purpose was that intended to serve? For those who simply watch movies and go blindly with the flow - without thinking - this is seemingly good entertainment but, for a movie to be hailed as great or award winning, there has to be more depth. So, if you are looking for something offering intelligence, you may not find it here.Also most disappointing is the obvious re-introduction of excessive cigarette smoking into movies (throughout the world) don't tell me this isn't deadly commercial product placement at its unsubtle worst - this sets the integrity of today's movie industry back over 50 years."
" Taut, simple-ish but realistic-looking thriller with very downbeat message
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,8,"As a huge Emily Blunt fan with enthusiasm extending somewhat beyond the purely rational, I was somewhat surprised to see her (in the role of the FBI's Kate Macer) handing over control of the plot - and hence the starring role - on at least two occasions in ""Sicario"" - in an interesting enough technique and one we get to see deployed surprisingly rarely in films. Still, Emily does not disappoint in her role, though Benicio del Toro as Alejandro certainly has a mountain of screen presence, and his part differs from hers in remaining competent at all times, while Macer is in truth out of her depth as she joins a combined-agencies anti-drugs operation (initially detailed quite well and - one would feel - extremely realistically, but later assuming more of a ""sketchy"" look). A further co-star here is Josh Brolin, who sadly comes up with the distinctly irritating character of Matt Graver (CIA). Nevertheless, one is more than tempted to believe that those with ""the A"" can indeed be like this, so presumably it's only reasonable.The plot here is a relatively straightforward one, which the above mini-description goes a long way towards encapsulating; but the ""fun"" here, while it lasts, lies in the depiction of some very ""interesting"" relationships on and around the US-Mexican border (at times well or even stunningly presented by aerial shots and so on). Indeed, how could this border be other than a star of the film in its own right - given the truth about the circumstances of the neighbouring El Paso (Texas) and Ciudad Juarez (Mexico)? For there they sit, with normal-ish, civilised life on one side of the border and anarchy and misery and mass murder on the other. Art of course imitates life here, as documentaries like Simon Reeve's excellent ""Tropic of Cancer"" and the superb ""Toughest Place to be a Nurse"" (both HUGELY to be recommended, by the way) have covered this ground in reality, and indeed Sicario's fictionalised version cannot top those real-life stories, though we do at least know how authentic and impressive (impressively scary) the former looks.This film does no favours to Mexico as a tourist destination or in any other light, but it throws up the expected number of questions about what methods are justified and who are really the good guys - indeed it probably asks more questions even than we anticipate (not least in a very interesting vignette starring Julio Cedillo). Real answers seem few and far between, however, and the fact that this is now ""the way of the world"" hardly seems satisfactory, all the more so given the potential sentence-ending of ""and forever will be""... We know this is a war that is not being won, and we can scarcely extract much satisfaction from the idea that ""desperate situations call for desperate measures"". Naturally, our Emily stays on the right side of that kind of line - pretty much; but then she is told in no uncertain terms what we the viewers have already come to appreciate (perhaps even shockingly, given our experiences of supremely self-assured Blunt characters, such as the one in ""Edge of Tomorrow"") - that here is someone whose methods fail and are out-of-date, a fish out of water (as indeed anybody interested in traditional, transparent procedures would now seem to be). And that is a far from pretty thought.Overall, then, this film offers up an appropriate degree of tension, looks mostly authentic, and leaves one feeling both alarmed and miserable. Job well done, then, Director Denis Villeneuve and writer Taylor Sheridan, but in no way is this any kind of pleasure watching.Worthwhile it probably will be, however, and much recommended for that reason..."
" Intense Film That Puts You In The Fight Against Drug Cartels
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,9,"Director Dennis Villeneuve crashed the Hollywood directors scene in 2013 with the brutal (yet spectacular) ""Prisoners"". Later that same year, he crafted the ingenious mind-bender ""Enemy"". After those two films, I knew I had to see what he would come up with next. ""Sicario"" is a much different kind of movie than those previous two, but even so it still manages to showcase Villeneuve's talents behind the camera.For a basic plot summary, ""Sicario"" is a story about the Mexican drug cartels. Kate Mercer (Emily Blunt) is a cop who deals with the drug problems caused by the cartels every day. After one particularly frustrating operation, Kate is given the opportunity by her boss (Josh Brolin) to strike at the heart of the problem in Mexico itself. This is a big-time operation, with the decisions being made in it equally as complex. Along for the ride is Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), a shadowy figure you get the feeling isn't quite who or what he seems.""Sicario"" is a solid movie on two levels:First, it really captures the tension of the drug cartel scene. It's like those kind of episodes from ""Breaking Bad"", but ratcheting up the intensity tenfold. This genre is not usually my cup of tea in the least, but there is such an atmosphere of tension that I couldn't help but be sucked into the action. There are scenes, like a tense border crossing and a shootout in dug-out cartel tunnels, that will literally have you on the edge of your seat. Not a boring moment in the entire film.Secondly, and perhaps equally as important, Villeneuve is able to take such a serious topic and layer great character narratives on top of it. There are even multiple surprises along the way, including an ending that you won't see coming and would traditionally seem out of place for a typical film of this subject matter. That's why I'm being pretty tight-lipped about the plot, as I don't want to spoil anything. When was the last time you had to worry about spoilers for a drug cartel film?!Thus, I have to say that ""Sicario"" was a great success for Villeneuve, as it proves that his unique style can translate into pretty much any kind of cinema format. He's that savvy. This is a great, tense, film that will hold your interest and never let it wane even for a moment. It doesn't matter if you prefer action, narratives, twist, etc., as ""Sicario"" provides them all in equal value. I'm very excited to see what this relatively new director can pull out of his bag of tricks next!"
" Breathless
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,10,"As perfectly told in the Guardian, Sicario uses private planes, public roads and clandestine tunnels to slip back and forth across borders both moral and geographical, between Mexico and the United States of America. The title means ""hitman"" in English language. The movie keeps its plot to its climax. The performance of Del Toro and Blunt are remarkable. Would definitely recommend to watch or to add to your watch-list."
" Got 30 mins in and its like some girly feely movie
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,2,"I'm sorry, got as far as 30 mins into this trying hard but it seems to be some kind of girly feeling stuff sort of thing as its spent staring at some woman policeperson's face reacting to things and nothing out of ordinary TV happening. Boring boring boring. Yet more usual hyped up Hollywood nonsense? I don't know, I have a life to lead.Apparently I have to write 5 more lines of text because I wasn't clear enough with the first 5. Well, I'm all for the women's point of view and equality and all that. I'm just bored out of my wits, being a man, with watching some poor woman's face all day long as she reacts to emotional stuff. Those guys have a job to do. Get over it and get on with it. Yes people get killed because of the drug trade. We know that. There have been a hundred films about it already.All the Hollywood hype is just plain shite."
" What was the tone supposed to be here?
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,4,"Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is an FBI agent working in Arizona to take down the Mexican drug cartel and their distributors within US. She gets recommended to a joint task force that is designed to take the fight to the enemy on the other side of the border. The team consists of long time veterans of the drug war and it quickly becomes clear that Kate is very much not in the know.Sicario was directed by Denis Villeneuve, who has made a lot of noise recently in the film circles and whose scifi film Arrival is just about to be released. Personally I've seen from him the movie Prisoners. It was a nihilistic, overly dark thriller about the darkness of human condition. It seemed to hate humanity and life in general, setting as its goal to drag the viewer down to dirt with it and make him realize that it's a miserable planet to live on. Deep down everyone is rotten and flawed, most people think only of themselves and even altruistic people are prevented from doing much by those around them. In a word it was depressing. Sicario is the same.Now, to be fair, it is a very professional movie. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the slow panning shots of Mexico. The realistic style serves the subject matter well. The dialogue is, if not overly memorable, at least interesting enough to follow. And the final confrontation between a member of the task force and the drug cartel boss is a great piece of cinema without a doubt. It's intense, filled with hinted backstory and suitably brutal in its conclusion, fitting the movie as a whole.But here's the problem. The said confrontation is not between Kate and the drug boss. Instead it's Benecio del Toro's character that confronts the boss. And del Toro's character is by far the best in the whole movie. He has the most backstory, the best presence and the most memorable characteristics. So why wasn't the movie about him in the first place? And believe me, I have absolutely no problems with seeing Emily Blunt in a role requiring her to be tough and action-oriented. I know she can pull it off. But in this movie her character is a tool. Now, she is a tool on purpose, because it fits the plot, but it makes the movie aggravating to watch from the audience point of view, because we feel alongside her that we have nothing to contribute. That we have no control. That we're only being used. And yes, that is an intentional choice on the film makers' part, but it's one I cannot agree with.And that's Sicario. It's a well-made crime thriller and probably well-deserving of its praise. I just personally hate its message, its whole style. I don't watch movies to realize that the world is an ugly place. I don't watch them to be depressed. As such, this movie has earned my scorn."
" Zero Stars
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,1,"I expected a decent watch from this. The cast seemed up to scratch but the only redeeming character is played by Benicio Del Toro he played an amazing role. Unfortunately he wasn't enough to save this rubbish movie. It was unrealistic, slow and boring. It had so much more potential to be great but missed every opportunity. At times I had trouble following the story line due to the holes in the movie. Emily Blunt is boring and was the absolute worst choice for a lead female in this instance. I was so disappointed with it it's put me off any movies by this director and that feature Emily Blunt and Josh Brolan at least for the immediate future. Bored to death!!"
" Cold
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,10,"Back when I was younger we had a slang for certain people. It was used for people who we considered heartless or maybe someone that operated on a ""I don't give a bleep"" level. We called them cold-blooded, or cold. It was a term of endearment though. ""Man, you cold."" Like, man you're doing some stuff I could never work up the nerve to do.That's how I would characterize this movie. Cold. Along with cold it was extremely intense. Like that hold-your-breath-so-you-can-be-aware-of-everything-that's-going-on intensity. And the pervasive musical score with the low bass chords added to the intensity. I thought the movie was going to be a hit-man/double agent/super spy movie with extreme gadgets, extreme explosions, extreme stunts and an extreme death toll. It's not that. Or I'll say, it's not quite that. This movie went for authenticity. There's no 007/Ethan Hunt/super spy performing these miraculous fight moves, deftly killing people with the most unlikely weapon and escaping death defying situations. Upon seeing Emily Blunt (Kate Macer), I figured she'd be a super badass that would be kicking butt and taking names and could outdo even the best man. She was bad, but there was a realistic limit to her skill set.The action was gritty, slow moving, calculated action that conforms to the rules of physics and reality. There's tactical planning on a basic level, constant communication and methodical execution of said plans. And did I mention that it's cold?The story is a simple yet terrific one. The U.S. is stepping up its effort to curtail drugs flowing into the U.S. from Mexico with the help of an ""adviser"". This adviser has a right hand man, Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), who adds an element of mystery to the entire operation. And he adds the frigidness. This man sleeps in a freezer. He drinks water and pees ice. Every scene he was in the temperature dropped. He was one cold piece of work.The movie was masterfully done. It drove home the seriousness of the drug violence without making it look fake and superfluous. Even the subdued nature of the acting added to the quality of the film. No person was out of place or there to make a splash. This was just one of those movies where the pieces fit perfectly. Sicario has just become one of my favorites."
" disappointing and lacking Michael Mann style authenticity
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,6,"i had very high hopes for this movie, with the general buzz surrounding director Denis Villeneuve, who also directed Arrival (which I thought was OK and not great) and who is now directing Blade Runner 2 which I no longer have high hopes for after seeing this..the movie lacks basic authenticity and this gets worse as the story progresses, culminating with the ending.. we are expected to believe that a Mexican drug boss one down from the top of the food chain will drive alone at night through the desert, and that the big boss himself has 4 bodyguards the way that the central female character becomes a snivelling girl and pawn at the end, is also highly disappointing, and more than a bit patronisingtechnically i thought the night vision camera scenes looked and sounded really cheap, and the sound mix is all over the map throughout the movie, I haven't had to ride the volume button so much in quite a while Michael Mann is the master of authenticity when it comes to this type of movie, he gets details right, and he makes Villeneuve look extremely amateur"
" One of THEE worst movies you'd ever watch, you'd be better off going to the supermarket and compare biscuits
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,1,"I would give it less than one if it wasn't for Del-Toro's part- which was the badass part. Other than that, usually I wouldn't write a review, but this movie annoyed me so much that i had to. No story whatsoever, The chick's part is a sexist chick's part, has no taste, has no meaning, only a waste of time and cigarettes. No action- maybe 50 shots fired, and maybe 10 people killed overall (nicely done by an Del-Toro). Other than that, I'd rather hear my grandma talk about knitting heart shapes on a green sweater, while watching the history channel on 3am. If it wasn't for the high rating and the awesome yet dull in this Del-Toro i would've never watched this movie or recommend anyone to ever watch it, ever. And ever and ever. I would rather count how many sheets of paper are in a paper towel. The movie is HIGHLY overrated on IMDb AND any other website you would see. Do yourself a favor, go mow the lawn or renew your library pass or something like that- you'd have more fun."
" Blah!
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,5,"Blah but you can follow the story. Sicario has a story-line which keeps the viewer captive for how, and what will happen with the ending. Regrettably the characters are 2 dimensional and flat. Emily Blunt is the Jodi Foster type character from Silence of the Lambs who is disjointed and filled with doubt! Benicio Del Toro is the cold South of the border hit man right out of every mob movie. Josh Brolin the evil C I A guy aka Tommy Lee Jones style which was cold/calculating. Daniel Kaluuya flat character is the moral support of the Jodi Foster style character. The character development/character driven stories are so old/predictable which kills the story. Shocking ending became another predictable C I A government is evil story with the what did just do story-line. I wish there was a plot twist, or character twist. Saw the ending coming. 5 out of 10 stars."
" Where's Sigourney When You Need Her?
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,3,"Yes, this is another one of those movies where skinny armed girls fire high caliber weapons without suffering any kickback. The opening scene sets the silliness. Emily Blunt is a member of an assault team taking down a drug lords house. Blunt looks like Snoopy in his flight helmet, her tiny head overwhelmed by the armor. After the action, we slide fast into the ""knitted brow"" school of acting pioneered by knocked knee, flat footed superstar Leo DiCaprio; the knitting of the brow compensating for the lack of physical grace needed for a believable action star (Mitchum, McQueen, The Duke, Eastwood). Blunt can knit a brow along with the best but it just can't save this PC casting silliness."
