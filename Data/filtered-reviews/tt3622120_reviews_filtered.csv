" Completely Absorbing True Story
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,9,"I was totally absorbed for the entirety of this film's 108 minutes. It starts off a little slow, thankfully, to get you acquainted with its group of protagonists. This is a true story, so you really need to know who is who, and who they are as people, to get the full effect.Back in 2006 a group of British soldiers in Helmand Province, Afghanistan wound up in a landmine in a dry river bed, tending to the hideous wounds of one of their own. Attempts to leave resulted in further detonations and various other complications, which leads to some extremely hard viewing in the retelling here.I won't give away any more of the 'plot' than that as it would dilute the effect of this brilliantly-made film but I will take the chance here to praise the cinematography, editing, and a script that's funny, tragic, tense and various combinations of those things at different times.The very best war films do a few things. They make you understand and empathise with the differing motivations of a plurality of characters. They make you understand how people do extreme things in a combat situation or zone. And they make show you the violence and horror of war without glamourising it. This film knocks it out of the park on all those points.Highly recommended."
" Sorry... really?
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,3,"Any 5 year old playing XBOX will know that after one mine goes off, you are better off by firing shots to the ground than just using your ruck sack as a snowboard or a spring board!!!U N B E L I A V A B L E"
" A moving, superb watch.
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,10,"Nothing over the top, raw and real. A superb film showcasing camaraderie between brothers in the British Army."
" Real war
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,10,"This is possibly one of the most realistic war films ever made. No glamour. No sweeping music. Just grit, raw and true. For anyone who was out there - it is real. A salute to brave men, to courage and also to their training and determination. It should be viewed by anyone who really wants to know and care."
" Just check you really want to watch it
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,7,"The other reviews are all correct, Kajaki is honest, illuminating, and brilliantly delivered. I only point out for the sake of other people deciding whether to watch this, it really is harrowing. If you don't have a specific interest in the realities of war, you might find yourself wishing you hadn't started it.Does this story need to be told? Absolutely
Do I wish I'd watched a comedy instead? Yes"
" Good film. Tense and very real
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,8,I almost felt like I was their mates. Was on the edge of my seat throughout. Good film.
" Real undiluted war education film
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,10,"The most realistic depiction of war on film I have ever seen. The film is about British Soldiers, so it is spoken in English with real English accents and with British military slang.
So..If you only like war filmA where all guns are blazing and the hero has unlimited ammo and bullets magically miss him and history is rewritten for you amusement.Or if you're an American that has not yet realised you don't actually speak English.Don't watch it, don't review it. Just do us all a solid and just jog on."
" Dreadful
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,4,I can't believe the reviews. I tried and only gods know I really did. I just couldn't take it Any more I had to turn it off.
" Dark, humourous, tragic
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,7,"I was expecting something different, and the film does well to keep you captivated considering the plot and budget.I'm not sure how real this is, but looks about right for an unfortunate untrained bunch"
" Rubbish.
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,5,How did this film get such a high review? Just the opening 20 minutes I was ready to switch off. Sick of seeing these young jack the lad cocky little idiots being in someone else's country and thinking they bloody own the place. I don't think the Afghans wanted you to fight their battles you know. If you're going to do various tours as a soldier then don't take the p**s out of the locals. Is this a British thing then?Before anyone says anything I'm British but the way these soldiers were acting made me turn off.Garbage.
" WHATVTHE HECK?!
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,1,Where in the heck did those British soldiers/actors come from? I can understand a damn thing but all their damn bad words! You people are need to dub this one! I think it was only made for Brit TV.
" One of the best war films
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,10,"Other reviewers have said it, so I'll keep it short - stunning.This isn't Hollywood - there aren't chisel-jawed action heroes with kevlar plot armour to see them out of harm's way. This is reality - ordinary soldiers, who talk like soldiers actually talk instead of how scriptwriters think they should - in a horrendous situation. It actually happened, too."
" Horrifying and moving in equal measure
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,9,"I saw this film a few years ago and I was haunted by it for weeks after. Having a family member who has served in this theatre, I was left more thankful than ever for his safe return. The horror of what transpired this day and the bravery of both those stricken and their rescuers left me in bits and full of respect for anyone who has to deal with the aftermath of a mass-casualty incident. The story is told in a frank, unexploitative tone without any histrionics to cheapen the impact of what you are witnessing. The only caveat I would add is that many audiences will find the dialogue very hard to follow, particularly where it concerns the Scottish characters although this isn't an especially wordy film. I myself struggled at times to keep up, despite having Scottish relatives and a passing familiarity with British military lingo (knowing what a ""bimble"" is could prove useful, for example). Ultimately though, the story isn't rooted in the dialogue but in the experiences of the men involved and I doubt it's impact would be much diminished for anyone who can't fully understand what's being said.
I was profoundly moved by this film and I cannot recommend it highly enough, just be warned that it is by no means an easy watch."
" If you are a squaddie, then you'll know
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,9,"If you have ever served in the British Army in the recent past, then this film will speak to you.
You don't fight for Queen, you don't fight for Country. You fight for the bloke on either side of you. And that's how the British Army has worked for decades, even centuries. This film & the story it tells shows that."
" Unforgettable unmissable
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,10,"Heartbreaking, gripping account of British soldiers in a pointless war who display heroism for their mates regiment and country slowish start and difficult to watch at times almost unknown very underrated film, Graphic scenes!"
" Gripping from start to finish absolute must watch
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,10,One of the best war films I've ever seen. The realism is what makes it stand out. Brings more excitement and anxiety than anything else. It really brings a connection to the soldiers and at times is hilarious and tragic. Nothing compares to this masterpiece.
" Gritty and plausible story of a war in a far off place.
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,7,"There are few films from the Afghan theatre of operations that feature a perspective from one of the allies - and this does that quite well. A British squad set off to investigate Taliban activity near their hilltop position at the Kajaki Dam. As they cross a wadi, they discover, horrifically, that it is riddled with landmines and they have to try to negotiate their way our of it - an extremely perilous proposition. Paul Katas directs a team of actors - none especially famous - that well encapsulates the team spirit and reliance as well as demonstrating the fear and horror of their predicament; there are no simple solutions; sudden helo-evacuations just a preponderance of well presented terror! I can't speak for the authenticity of the depiction - but the absence of any overt Hollywood treatment seems to give this more credibility and there ain't no happy endings for everyone either... Well worth a watch, but it doesnt pull it's punches so whilst it is not gratuitous, it is definitely not for the squeamish."
" A movie for video game lovers who have never ventured into the real world.
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,1,"The most obvious place for a mine.....is on the path. Because one mine blows your mate up... it dosn't mean there are no more. Because a second mind blows another mate up.......... ""Damn me"", ...why would you still think there are no more? Maybe the 3rd mine blowing you up....might just get through to you that you're in a mine field."
" A very intimate and grisly war film
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,9,"It doesn't get much more real than this film. ""Kajaki"" is a true story about the fate of a group of British soldiers who found themselves stuck in a mine-field in Afghanistan in 2006. They were based at a quiet remote outpost, and while conducting a patrol of a dried-up riverbed just down from their fortifications, one of their men stepped on a mine and had his leg blown off. When more men went down from the hill, including medics, a few more mines went off and maimed more soldiers, leaving the ones that were alive with no choice but to sit still in the ditch and wait for air-extraction, which, surprisingly and frustratingly, was awkward and long about coming.""Kajaki"" is one of the most intimate and realistic war films that I've ever seen, because of the superb acting and directing. It's very realistic and the natural performances from the cast contribute in making it seem real, almost like documentary footage. It's also very intense, as you don't know what step is going to reveal a landmine and another limb being blown off. You can feel the heat and the dust in your eyes and mouth."
" Boring
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,5,The movie is boring but i feel for the people who serves in the war to their country. I like war movies but with some action and this one was not that kind if you are more into action movies.
" A hidden gem!
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,9,"Really enjoyed this film. A group of British heroes get stuck in a mine field and all hell breaks loose.
Characters played very well by some fairly unknown actors who id like to see more of in the future in bigger films.
Loved seeing the real heroes at the end compared to the actors who played them.
Filmed and written very well, this film really is a hidden gem!"
" Not the elite
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,3,"The SAS are elite soldiers. This is a film about stupid soldiers. One gets his leg blown off unexpectedly - no one could predict that. But after, instead of clearing a safe path by firing at the ground or throwing rocks the're jumping about on a knapsack. This is not a film about military bravery - it is about military stupidity. War should be waged by highly fit, highly intelligent, highly focused professional soldiers not thick 'heroes'."
" All round horror show
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,1,"Bad acting, filming, directing. I didn't enjoy a single minute of this movie. No connection with the characters, stinted dialogue. I'm actually upset I wasted time on this."
" Very hard to watch
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,7,"I'll admit I didn't finish it. Whilst the graphic nature of the depiction of injuries is fully in context, the hopelessness of the situation is heartbreaking. It brings home the stark reality of battlefield trauma and, so well is this film presented, the audience lives it. I wish I could have stuck with it but just could not."
" Heartbreaking
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,10,Just goes to show what these men and women do for our country. 🇬🇧
" Should have been a documentary.
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,5,"The only words I could understand we're swear words.
Probably well crafted. Kudos to the real soldiers but this was not my cuppa tea."
" Real War
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,10,Real War. British perspective. All I can say is watch it. Forget the Hollywood garbage.
" Do not let your wives see it !
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,10,"Cos' mine cried for two nights , and i ... i think i've got PTSD just for seeing that movie . And i was in the military . Perhaps cos' i can block what's happened to me , but not to others .
Really folks, this so lately movie seen by me and then me missus , it's so realistic and to top it off inspired from a real story , that is no wonder Harry ( former prince now ) quit the "" Firm "" who is sending young guys to loose limb and life in the defense of England outside its borders . I bet he had seen some really bad stuff .
A very well done movie , describing the horrors or war and the suffering of those trying to make a living out of it .
Ten stars for a shockingly realistic movie , ten stars for a very good job done by everyone ."
" Had To Turn On the Subtitles
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,10,Haha great movie but my simple Alabama country self couldn't understand a word these dudes were sayin'. For real though I loved it.
" Dang
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,8,"This movie once it gets going, it really gets crazy! I will say the first 30 or so minutes were VERY slow, and I was on the verge of being bored...but I'm very glad I stuck it out, because once it gets moving ...it never lets up.The carnage is very realistic, and the reaction of the men feels very authentic as well.It's very intense, and it shows the bravery of these men.We all owe our respect to these men, far too often we forget that we didn't go into Iraq alone, right or wrong (reason for going) England, and a few others stuck by us and went to fight in a war that wasn't their war. We owe them our thanks.This film is unlike any other as there is almost no, actually I don't think there is any firefights, but it's action packed in a way that isn't a popcorn flick."
" Shocking and eye opening
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,10,I found myself getting anxiety waiting for the warriors to taken out of danger while being in aww of their bravery. The tone/ situation came through the screen. I found myself realizing how small my problems are
" Absolutely incredible!!
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,8,"'Kajaki' is probably one of the most intense war movies you will ever watch. Having said this, note this is not a full-on war movie. Instead, this is dramatic events as a result of war.The film is incredibly well made and realistic. Thus some of the scenes are almost unbearable to watch. 'Kajaki' is one of those rare films that are almost too well made to sit through thinking this is entertainment. It plays like a documentary - almost like a found footage tape, only its not found footage style. It is heart wrenching, cringe worthy, and also a sad reality. The acting was superb. The lack of CGI made it all that more realistic. The film also has no score. Most of the film is in absolute silence, which is highly effective and also very creative.The dialogue features many codes and lingo I didn't understand. The dialogue was really strange, yet realistic, but very difficult to follow. Despite that, the film itself was easy enough to follow. The make-up is incredible! 'Kajaki' is a film you can't really describe to anyone - you have to experience it for yourself - maybe best viewed alone at least once. This certainly is a film I will remember for a very long time.https://paulsmoviereviews.wordpress.com/2019/10/10/kajaki-kilo-two-bravo-2014/"
" Graphic And Tense; A Good Depiction Of A War Zone
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,7,"It's hard to find the right words to describe this film. Gritty. Realistic. Sombre. Tense. All of them fit as a good description. The strength of this movie is that it seems to offer a very accurate portrayal of life in a war zone. The story is about a British unit who find themselves hopelessly stuck in a mine field in Afghanistan in 2006. Several are wounded (the wounds are graphically depicted) and they have no way of knowing where the rest of the mines are or how many there are Theyre stuck; they can't move. All they can do is wait for a helicopter evacuation that seems to take an eternity to arrive. The tension of the mine field is easily felt, and it's a superb contrast to the opening of the movie, that deals with a great deal of character development and seems t make the point that, for the most part, life in a war zone is pretty boring. There's really nothing much happening for this unit; there's really very little for them to do. That probably sums up an average day in many or most war zones. But the sudden shift into a crisis was startling and well presented. As the wounded soldiers lie on the ground, tended by an overwhelmed medic, we listen as they prepare to die - asking for final words to be passed on to their families and coming to terms with the end approaching.Everything in this is very well portrayed. War is certainly not glorified in this. It's either dull or nauseatingly bloody. I've never been to war, but I've had the chance in my life to know a lot of veterans, and I think they'd probably agree with the way war is presented here. It's quite a well done account of a true story, although it's probably not for those who are squeamish about the sight of blood or severed limbs - of which there are many. (7/10)"
" Scottish soldier with perfect teeth=goof !!!!
",2019-08-28 00:00:00,10,"I watched this film a couple of weeks ago and noticed that one (or two?) Scottish soldier had perfect teeth, this doesn't happen in real life, IRN BRU...I enjoyed this film, great acting and great story........"
" Very intense Movie
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,8,I'm Waiting a Very intense Movie it's very touching really fill for the guys
" where every step can be your last
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,10,"I watched this and suddenly became immersed In this observation and kind of felt i was there, a spooky feeling, we are overlooking the Kajaki dam, its on high ground, its hot, dry, mind draining stuff.. we join the story with the resupply, and get to know the people we with... we watch a air strike overnight and the next day we are out with a small patrol, call sign Kilo Two Bravo, and off we go with this patrol, walking with them, every step. The tension is intense and this comes through to us watching them work, My heart is going, the adrenalin pumps and I think all is ok..should be an easy shift....No such thing in these badlands...then all hell breaks out as we suddenly have Casualties within the patrol and realise we just walked in to a mine field, we patch up our men and need assistance asap...I soon understand the fear our men are experiencing, the pain and the anger as recovery is ballsed up,finally our Medic TUG gets to and he is now keeping his boys alive, the Boss Mark Wright is Also serious Injured..despite this he keeps his boys going, sorting meds etc In serious need of an evac the patrol and rescue patrol eventually get lifted out we all get rescued, we are living this patrol, and are feeling the same emotions they are..but we are alive...we survived this one..unaware of whats going on with our mates ahead of us.. ,there is no one single hero in this observation, in my opinion They are all heroes... there are casualties in War and ""policings"" Kilo Two Zero is no exception...with their share that day of many who were working that day in the country..it later transpires there are maps available of the minefields ? why the bases and men are not issued with them is a matter for the Upper echelons of Army Command and Whitehall to sort out and ensure they are issued
This is snapshot of daily life for ISAF in Afghan of one small UNIT, where all our servicemen and women who complete their tour or tours are in my mind heroes in their own right, but they wont say that, like their grandparents great grandparents, they are doing a job, serving their queen and masters...they are the Unassuming heroes of our time and we must honour them...Just view this film, the actors are top of their game, and this in my opinion is one of the best modern films made about our men and women who serve ...to keep us , their mates safe in a dangerous world...I apologise in advance for the disjointed review....i hope i get the point over how good this movie is"
" hard to watch
",2019-06-16 00:00:00,7,"This film shows the true courage they had to deal with what was a mess. They walked in to uknown russian minefied from a prevoius war. one moment of madness almost cost them all their lifes. This is classsed as collatral damage, but maybe they should not have been put in that situation."
" Spoilers- Horrific but has a beauty of its own
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,10,"The first time I watched this, I watched it a second time straight away.I know someone who met some of these guy while serving. They're relationships and their selflessness was brotherly love and duty at its best.Beautiful acted and edited, I would love to shake the hand of every veteran and actor. My heart goes out to the family of the fallen and I hope they get some comfort from seeing his heroic acts and the love and relationship between him and his platoon.Thank you to all who serve and it's terrible to see this unnecessary loss from heirloom mines."
" Heart wrenching but a must-see
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,9,Very well done. Excellent movieDid anyone else have to watch the whole movie with closed captioning on just to understand what they were saying?
" If you know what war is, actually, then this movie is a waste of your time
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,3,"Some soldiers get gruesomely injured and/or die a slow and pointless death in a pointless mission of a political, invasive war. The movie is a slow trainwreck and I feel cheated of my time. The only positive I can voice is that it's relatively moderate in its attempts at glorifying this whole mess..."
" Didn't expected much from this movie but very glad i saw this.
",2018-12-12 00:00:00,10,"I didn't knew much about this movie and thought it to be the usual war movie, but glad i watched it. The movie is more about the horrors of war and survival. The situation this soldiers get into and the way it escalates one after other is intense. One could feel their fear and pain. Just watch this and the start is a bit slow, but bear with it and you will be pleased. And ya it's also based on true story."
" Up There With Hurt Locker: Kajaki
",2018-12-04 00:00:00,7,"This film has a lot in common with Hurt Locker, except it is represented by a different nationality. This makes absolutely no difference in warfare. Wasted and ruined lives are tragic in all wars within all nationalities. This war was a complete waste; Afghanistan. No one learns from history. The Russians, who were far more brutal than the British and Americans, couldn't win in seven years there. How ignorant and arrogant of our country's political and military leaders to think we could succeed where the Russians failed. America is very good at ignoring history. We did exactly the same thing in Vietnam. I support these young men and their families, not the idiotic wars that our irresponsible government sends them into. A film that should be shown to congressmen and all chiefs of staff at the Pentagon before taking various military actions. Good acting and direction."
" Good story, shame about the script
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,4,"KAJAKI: A TRUE STORY is a simple, small scale tale about a group of British soldiers fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. Unfortunately their squad wanders into a mine field, men are trapped and wounded, and the survivors have to figure out how to get everyone out of the situation. This was a true story and it's a film made with a decent premise, but if I'm truthful I was expecting more. The first third of the film feels like padding, attempting to introduce the characters but failing to make them interesting or likeable. Mark Stanley, best known as Grenn in GAME OF THRONES, bags the lead role and is miles away from his best-known character. Once the action shifts to the mine field the tension increases, but it does flag a little before the credits roll. My main gripe with this is that the script is pretty bone-headed, constant swearing and repetition; I would have preferred no dialogue at all to this."
" So real
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,9,Unbelievably realistic and horrific war film. Excellent
" It's hard to watch at times but it's definitely worth watching.
",2017-12-11 00:00:00,8,"I've seen quite a bit hard-to-watch-movies. But in most of those cases it were fictional movies like The Human Centipede, Hostel, Saw or A Serbian Movie. But with Kajaki it's different because it tells a true story. So your mind is set up to watch this movie as it was real. And I have to admit I was sometimes physically unwell during some scenes. They are hard to watch, so if you have a weak stomach I wouldn't recommend you to watch some scenes. But about the movie itself it is a brilliant movie. Certainly one of the most captivating war movies I've seen. It's not about we are the good ones and the others are the bad ones. It's about the devastating consequences of mines. Most of the movie is shot at the same place but the intensity of the stress moments gave me all those emotions. The absurdity of wars, the footsoldiers being seen just as expendable losses, it's sometimes hard to conceive. The acting was brilliant. It was like being with them in war territory. Kajaki is a movie I won't easily forget. It's one of those movies I will talk about among friends for a long time."
" War without the Hollywood Hype
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,10,"This is a gripping, realistic film portraying events in Afghanistan as experienced by British Paras. It's interesting to read reviews by ex- servicemen & those with knowledge of the subject matter and the praises heaped (quite rightly) upon the movie and all associated with it in comparison to those who aren't ex-servicemen and lack knowledge regarding the issues men face in war and their sad little comments about 'how they'd do things if they were there'.War can be dull, dreary and interminable. Kudos to the production team for giving us reality instead of the over-hyped patriotic dross we see in American Sniper & 13 Hours."
" good, if depressing
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,10,"Great movie. Dialogue often hard to follow, even for one from a British family. One grandfather did 30 years with Cape Mounted Rifles of SA and at times a bodyguard for Rhodes, whom he disliked for his poor treatment of his horses; other grandfather was a Gloster from Jersey in Great War; father was reserve Gloster in WW2. 28th, remember Egypt!"
" Too painful to watch.
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,9,"Having served this film is often too painful to watch (the reason for my giving it a 9/10). It expresses the suffering and comradeship of warfare. This isn't just a film it's an education for a society disassociated from war. For those critics war isn't glorious or romantic. It's dirty and boring, and yes, people screw up. If you're stuck in a minefield without all the Gucci kit it's a bayonet and you're belt buckle, and it's hot and tiring and you make mistakes. Soldiers (at least the Toms) don't speak received English (so maybe you might have to pay more attention to what is being said)and yes they swear, live with it! There are plenty of wonderful war films where the (usually American) protagonists win the day with either a fashionable injury or glorious death; this isn't one of them. There is however humour and pathos in war and this expressed in loads. If everyone knew what war was really like nobody would want anything to do with one."
" A six-and-a-half-hour ordeal
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,6,"The film starts off slowly, it is low budget with some unknown actors giving it a naturalistic setting, but it really drags you in and at times you really want to close your eyes as the bombs keep going off and you hear the men scream.Kajaki is based on a true story, set in Afghanistan in 2006, a British army unit is providing security at a Hydro electric dam.The area is looming with minefields not from the post 2001 invasion but from the Soviet invasion in 1979. Some of the soldiers go to checkout an illegal Taliban checkpoint and are trapped and injured after stepping on a mine.The other soldiers need to go and rescue them but they need to avoid stepping into the mines, a rescue helicopter is called but they do not know that the vibrations of the blades could set off the mines and the chopper cannot land or winch the injured soldiers.Over the course of the film, the injuries increase, even the injured soldiers get re-injured, we get to learn more about the characters and their bravery.This is brutal uncomfortable viewing, there is some humour, some of it is bleak, one of the soldiers was in immense pain as the morphine did not work on him as he was allergic to it."
" Harrowing Film
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,10,"All politicians should see this harrowing film, before they casually commit our troops to harms way and death. To often they resort to the death and desruction option than exhausting non political alternatives A truly terrifying film, bringing home the realities of war, not like the American glorification of war"
" The Problem With Realism
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,7,"This came with a fair bit of acclaim in the build up to its release . Upon its release it did very little. This shouldn't be seen as to a comment on its quality , more down to the fact that a lot of British films fail to attract a major distribution deal. There's possibly something else and that is by 2014 Afghanistan had become a forgotten . NATO had done its best to make a fractured failed state in to a secular democracy. It was a failure but a noble one. It was also a conflict that was often waged by the Taliban via roadside bombs and other booby traps. In other words it's not a conflict that'll lend itself to pitched ""war porn"" type battles by Hollywood studios. If nothing else any film featuring Afghanistan can't be any worse than the previous British effort THE PATROL from the year before Thankfully KAJAKI does nail the mentality of the modern volunteer soldier. Conscription ended in Britain in 1960 and no one was happier than the British military themselves . If you have a military composed of people who want to be there you've got a better military machine and it's good to see the rest of NATO adopt a voluntary military. From the outset KAJAKI nails this point very accurately with Tug saying he left the army after being disappointed by the lack of action he saw in Iraq and re-enlisted when Britain extended its mission in Afghanistan. Civilians in general and the anti-war brigade in particular constantly forget that young men join the army to see some heavy duty adventure. Indeed one of the legacies of the Afghan conflict was the phenomena of ""The grief whore"" who'd line the streets of Wootan Bssset every time they'd hear bodies of military personal were repatriated As it stands KAJAKI is a story of British courage. In some ways it's a stark , poignant metaphor for the NATO mission to Afghanistan . It shows the unbreakable bond between soldiers and a heroic courage most humans are unaware of. The downside is that ""war is 99% boredom and 1% terror"". There's a danger that if you're making a film based on fact then if you're embellishing a story then the truth becomes more and more diluted due to embellishment. I don't feel KAJAKI suffers from embellishment but at the same time there does seem to be something missing. I guess that's because I'm a civilian and death on the battlefield is something unknown to me ? At the end of the day the veterans are more qualified than me to comment on the conflict in Afghanistan and I'll look forward to reading their comments"
" An extremely realistic and extremely boring movie
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,1,"The film is definitely very, very realistic; and that is what makes it very, very boring. With all respect for the real victims of that action, I am still bound to review a movie, and the paradox is that the movie pays a big price to hyper-realism; essentially, you see three men jumping on three mines on a goat track at the bottom of a valley in Afghanistan, and you then spend a hour and half watching them suffer, bleed, scream. The camera indulges very often in very realistic and crude close up of truncated legs, arms, fingers and various injuries. The reality of the action must have been absolutely dramatic, and the courage of some of the soldiers remarkable; unfortunately, this does not make a good movie."
