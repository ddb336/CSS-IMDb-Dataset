" Werewolves on a train! What's not to like about that?
",2021-04-11 00:00:00,7,"Werewolves on a train! What's not to like about that?! A bunch of varied commuters get stranded on a broken down late night train in the middle of the woods. After the driver disappears, they try to walk up the tracks they soon regret it - something is out there and it wants in! This creature feature totally does what it says on the tin - scary as hell monsters, believable characters from different background fighting to live through the night - plenty of gore but loads of fun too. A real stand out bad guy performance from Elliot Cowan as a psycho banker determined to survive. Great comic relief too from Amit Shah as a nerdy accountant who turns out to be surprisingly handy in a fight! Great cameos from Sean Pertwee, Rosie Day and Duncan Preston. Recommended."
" Gothic horror
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,6,"A survival moving train movie , where every passenger try to save from creature trying to kill everyone, there are many goosebumps seans, and there is a bit of lacking in storyline, Every character in the movie was done quietly good, A one time watachable movie"
" Great
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,7,"Howl's really a great film for horror genre but i felt a little strange to see that the character of billy is too heroic, he wasn't even afraid of werewolves. I felt a little strange on that but else the movie is awesome. Nice graphics and overall it is a good movie."
" A great popcorn flick
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,8,"A fun monster movie that plays to its strengths and doesn't try to overextend itself in any one direction. The directing, the cinematography and the acting are all great.I was a big fan of how the werewolves were handled in this movie, mostly kept as dark silhouettes with florescent yellow eyes. Very creepy and very effective. The only real negative I had with them is the design of the creatures. From the shoulders down to their toes they are perfect, it's just their faces I don't agree with; as their appearance ranges from slightly deformed human to gargoyle-like. None have the traditional wolfish design. But that is a small gripe.As mentioned before, the acting is quite solid as you can really understand every character as they go through the situation of being stranded in the middle of kilometers of forestry while monsters roam outside looking to get in. Although, to my own personal entertainment, it was very amusing to see a group of characters make all the worst possible decisions, almost as if they didn't want to survive the situation they were in. There's something wrong if the intended human antagonist of the film is the one with the practical ideas.Despite any nitpicks I have, this is still the best werewolf movie I've seen in recent years since Late Phases. While not a top tier classic like American Werewolf in London, Dog Soldiers or The Howling, this is still very entertaining and well worth watching."
" Solid and simple
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,4,Below telltale game quality level writing. But the action is somewhat interesting. It would be a good horror game.
" Bad lighting
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,1,The whole film takes place in the dark. The lighting is so bad you can't really see anything.
" ClichÃ© but fun...
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,9,"Hahaha, very good, a horror with a comic and trashy touch, irrelevant technical quality, but all very captivating, we create little bond with the characters, except the protagonist, who in his defeat and humiliation conquers us by pity, far from being a production exquisite, as will be a respectful cult for genre lovers... ClichÃ© but fun..."
" You may enjoy this more than me. It's around average (+ or -)
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,4,"There was nothing egregiously wrong with this movie. It definitely doesn't rank above b-movie. The premise itself is good, and it could have been a lot better if more time was spent caring about the script. The dialogue is very stupid, and some of the acting is very below-average and melodramatic, which doesn't add to the suspense at all.
In terms of the creatures, it's like the cast of the Thriller video and Gollum had babies, and instead of making dope music a videos or searching for rings, they ate you alive. For me, they weren't very threatening. I'm also just not that into werewolves, so if that's your thing, you may live this. I probably would have given it more credit if the baddies were sharks.
I won't see it again, but you should give it a try at least once!"
" Train full of wolf bait and no one to root for.
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,5,Seriously people. Most movie today just suck. No other way to put it. Literally every single person but maybe one on this train has any redeeming qualities or intelligence. Like many others the special effects are good. I just dont give a flying f@#$ if any of them survive. Everyone of the characters (except one in this) care only for themselves when crap hits the fan. Shows a lot about modern society. We cant even make up stories where people care for each other anymore. Maybe unbelievable romantic movies that are pure fantasy and not real.
" Watch it and you won't regret
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,6,"Watch it and you won't regret.Don't rely on reviews by rotten tomatoes or anyone else just watch and judge it yourself.The movie has little bit of lacking in storylines and all but definitely it's no less than any horror movie . Thrills you every moment and doesn't have any unwanted scenes in it.
The place where the train is stuck i.e creepy forest, fog and all makes it scary.
Direction , background music and graphics are good . Even though this is a low budget movie the werewolf looks realistic and adds quality to the film.
It can compete with the better ones in this genre.I regret not watching it earlier."
" It is a BEAST of a Movie! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘‘ðŸ‘‘ðŸ‘‘
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,9,"I'm describing the beginning scenes( 15 mins), but no spoilers or details on the rest.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The film starts its first 12-15 min playing out the characters' personalities,
and despite the mundane work of the train ticket inspector, he carries
the dead end job and low esteem feeling clearly through to the camera.Middle Class
One of the memorable scenes is when the ""middle class"" woman acts
polite at first when she ""can't find her ticket"" and plays a routine that
suggests she often enough got away with not paying a fine in these situations,
but she was visibly charged, when the ticket inspector insisted on her paying
the fine(pressured by his supervisor earlier, that he hadn't done so in 6 weeks).And look at that, she magically conjured British pounds in cash, and tensely waited for her change, ha ha, so much for ""looking"" like middle class, I guess
she notices that she's getting older and that routine works less and less and she's more angry about THAT, than paying the fine.
TEEN
Then there wis another passenger, an incredibly obnoxious teenager speaking loudly at her phone, seemingly fused to it, pretending not to hear the inspector
calling for her ticket, she keeps on talking. Here again, you feel the ticket inspector's lack of confidence as he barely croaks out the words ""ticket please"", and he needs a few more goes changing up the words, as if the words are the problem, lol, before his voice becomes notable enough for this self absorbed teenager to notice him and show the valid ticket.Ha ha ha, i'm sure the audience wanted to see what happened if she got fined, but the film makers switched this possibility around focusing instead on this so called middle class woman who tried to dodge the fare.
PLEASURE
There is another scene where he miserably tries to pick a conversation with
the stewardess, and progressively wanes in his confidence outputting after
each pathetic try, that kinda makes you feel for him, awwhhh ha ha ha.Her trolley falls over and he tries to pick it up for her, but even here he fails, as his lack of physical strength clearly shows, and the middle aged man, i'd say about 42, who happens to stand next to her, just picks it up in 0.2 seconds, making the inspector, I'd say 35, look even more pathetic, and the stewardess
is quietly but visibly impressed by that ""man's"" action, the camera is positioned well to show that. The inspector hangs around, looking aimless and somewhat distraught, and she finally suggests if he wants to move on to the next carriage, and so misery goes, ha ha.It is probably now I should mention that this particular carriage is empty and looks different, the lights are much less bright in there, and there seems to be some visibly obscure spaces available and the doors to the carriage are lockable ....
I'll leave the rest to your imagination, he he he.After a while the 42y old bloke comes out of that carriage, seemingly pumped and even more cocky, yeah ... I wonder what could have ""helped to massage"" his now invigorated state ..... wouldn't you ;) ?So 15 mins pass, and despite the monotony of this scene, i couldn't put my 2k resolution-screen phone down. Then finally, we see some action. The train halts in the middle of nowhere and the train driver goes out to see where the problem lies. After a while, the inspector uses the intercom to call the drivers cockpit. After a while again, he decides to use his key to enter the cockpit, I'm sure the 42y old bloke enjoyed that ha ha, and finds the driver not present and the door leading outside open.
THE MAIN COURSE
So here I will keep the rest short and obscure, if you haven't watched this well done must see film. I'll talk around, describing feeling rather than detail.There is something in the woods, a tense realization builds within the passengers. Of course authorities are to be called. And the feeling acts on the numbers by truth, the real objectivity of their situation.Their situation makes clear that leaving the train is not an option.The way the macabre is handled, the camera shots, is intense, oncoming, and severe at moments, going from obscure to fleetingly visible, to full head-on collision of the matter.Some discoveries go beyond what I expected, going the full mile, delicious and delightful in their gore.Some scenes are truly shocking, by their sound, and suggestion coupled with the appropriate visuals aiding the imaginations.
I'll give it 9/10 it is a done, but very well done story, using the constriction of the train to its full advantage."
" Just put it on.
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,8,"If you're like me, and you've watched close to every horror movie on Netflix and Hulu, save yourself some scrolling time and just put this on. You'll be glad you did.
It's so much better than its 5 star average review. There's an original werewolf design, and it's practical. Sure the people on the train are ""unlikable"" but, are you here to make friends or watch people get torn apart by werewolves? Especially unlikable people.
It's shot and acted well. There's some spooky moments in the dark of the forest, under a sky that promises if you just hang in a bit longer the sun will rise and it'll all go away.
Is it your typical people stuck somewhere surrounded by monsters movie, sure, but it IS one of the better ones."
" Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!!!
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,10,"My wife and I are always seeking original horror movies to watch. Sometimes finding one can be a real chore, despite the thousands of movies available across countless platforms. Then we stumbled onto this gem. Great story, great acting, great monsters! Loved every second of it. It's an old school horror flick for a new generation."
" Powerful and exciting!
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,10,"I have an affinity for British movies and TV. This is a brilliantly written, acted, and directed film. Ed Speleers is a brilliant young actor. He's here in America doing some films too. I thought that I had given up biting my nails, but this film had me on the edge of my seat. The twists are awesome. If you like creative horror, this film is for you."
" Howl is not bad movie
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,7,"Although I'm not quite a fan of werewolf movies, I have to say that this movie wasn't bad at all. Pretty good atmosphere and relatively well made masks. And most importantly, I wasn't bored with the film. Of course, it's still a long way from being a movie hit, but it's like not is bad movie."
" BORING!!!
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,2,Over acting from some actors...Bad script and boring movie overall
" Utterly boring non sense
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,1,"Watch if u want to waste 90 min of your life. Entire movie is boring, no logics, silly reasons, bad screen play. One dimensional characters..."
" Solid Addition to Werewolf Cinema
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,8,"""Howl"" honestly surprised me. I wasn't sure whether to expect a Christopher Smith-esque, straight laced horror, or something more akin to Neil Marshall's coal black humour. Interestingly, it fell somewhere in between the two. The central conceit of ""Howl"" is a little daft, but then again, what ISN'T daft when set against the backdrop of British banality? Taking its central premise seriously works in the film's favour as the tone never shifts away from being perfectly appropriate to the events unfolding on screen.No real scares, but a good atmosphere, and the practical effects look pretty great when considering that it was more than likely a low budget affair. Top notch lupine based horror."
" A nice addition to the British werewolf genre
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,8,"I always rate movies based on their genre, otherwise I would just compare apples with pinball machines. This is a werewolf movie and as such it is great! Not as good as Dog Soldiers, perhaps (that Sean Pertwee gag was funny, I guess), but still well acted, scary without having to rely on jumpscares or absurd characters and well done overall.The problem comes at the end, when the tension breaks and we see the weres, which are kind of makeshift and ugly and not so impressive as when you don't see them. And it really gets worse towards the very end, like they lost any interest in keeping it tight. However, overall it is a good low budget horror film which doesn't feel clichee and made just for the money, as most horror films are today."
" Not terrible but not great either
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,5,Very average low budget horror movie. Put it on in the background but it's not something you'll really remember.
" Only the millionth title with same storyline.
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,4,"A star for the fact that it looks like a professional movie, color grading and composition is reasonably good.
A star for the actors, they acted reasonably believable.
A star for the all the people who came together and finished a complete movie.So that's a total of 4 stars. 1 is the minimum and 3 for all the reasons above."
" Edge of the seat action
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,8,"This is one such movie that seems to be average but turns out to be pretty good. The setting for the movie is pretty standard for any horror movie, what makes it separate is it character building and plot building. It has been done perfectly. I loved every second of it."
" Howlingly pleasing..
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,7,"It is much better movie than the ratings suggest you to believe. A little gem if I may..
An ordinary red-eye train ride turns into an unexpected horror. Very well directed, cast and executed. It is very fluid camera keeps rolling and you with it..
Don't miss it!"
" ""Watchable"" at best
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,5,"It's crazy how different people's opinions are from half saying this movie is complete crap to half saying it's the best werewolf movie out there. Saying it's the best werewolf movie is a bit of a stretch! It's watchable at best. It's not bad for low budget. There's no great CGI or transformations, etc. But there is some okay gore. I gave it a 5 is because I was able to at least finish it, rather than just give up and turn it off. There was definitely no character development so nobody was even likable. But my biggest issue is that once again it's as if the director/writers ran out of ideas and just ended the movie."
" Below average in every way.
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,2,"A lazily made film lacking in a variety of inventive ways to kill the werewolves which should have happened to entertain the audience but the makers couldn't be bothered. A bit of a poor script and character development which leads to the audience not caring what happens to them. Very little in the way of frights which for an alleged horror film was again just lazy film making. Be like the film makers, be lazy and don't bother watching it. It was also far too darkly lit for 90% of the running time which makes special effects a bit cheaper of course."
" Werewolves On the Prowl In Rural England!
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,10,"This movie had an excellent cast, believable characters, lots of suspense and twists and turns and a spooky atmosphere. Recommended especially around Halloween! ðŸŽƒ"
" Decent Werewolf Movie
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,6,This film was ok - it was about a group of people on a train who get stuck and attacked by werewolves. It has a nice creepy script and some cool monsters. It's not great - but nothing about it sucks. There isn't any moment in the movie where I wish I was watching something else. A very passable monster movie that falls short of being memorable but a decent enough horror film. I would watch other movies from this creative team.
" Someone fix these peoples brains!
",2020-09-25 00:00:00,1,"Every character is laughably STUPID. The ""villain"" is the good guy till the end he says we gotta leave someone behind other than that he's the only one with a brain yeah he was quite a d**** but atleast he Had a slightly bigger iq than the rest. How would that help exactly, they are fast that would only buy a little time. Plus throughout every one goes shhhh shhh shhh don't let them hear us. THEY ALREADY KNOW WHERE YOU ARE THEY WATCHED YOU GO THROUGH THE DOOR AND STOP. The werewolf's are terrible, it's not even slightly scary, not tense, awful boring action too and already said beyond stupid characters. There is also a guy who unblocks the door then goes to the bathroom after the werewolf has attacked because big brain. Then a girl after watching another girl attacked through a door and bit savagely says ""what happened to her"" wtf do you think musta been the gravity change that happens all the time then her flesh fell off."
" Fun flick!! Decent cast and story!!
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,8,"Not original by any means and more horror than comedy but it did what its supposed to do it entertained us!! Everyone always makes it difficult and creates reasons why a movie isn't good, but it always comes down to 1 thing...entertainment!!
Enjoy this fun flick!!"
" Great Movie(Howl)
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,8,This movie is really so Entertaining me.I love it.Totally timepass movie.Wow.
" A really good werewolf movie
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,8,"It's a solid entry in the werewolf genre, and I am very picky about horror. The werewolves look great, and there is enough character development and drama to make it really interesting. Highly recommended if you like this genre."
" Nice werewolf movie...
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,6,"Pretty enjoyable horror movie, but what hapenend to the guy who tried to fix the train?"
" Cool Werewold Flick
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,7,"431. Howl. A bark at the moon good time! Yes, no? Oh well... Joe, a train guard on a passenger train, just finished his shift, heads to his locker to get changed, there's a note inside, from the boss, Joe didn't get promoted. His rival David quickly comes over to fill him in that he got the job, and his first role as boss is to tell Joe he's gotta do another shift. Joy. So off he goes, his cute co-worker offers her condolences on the job, Joe takes this as flirting, asks her out, gets turned down, now he gets to work with her all night!! And just when the trip gets going good, the train strikes a large animal on the tracks. The conductors and ya know, other train types, go out to look at the damage and don't return leaving Joe in charge. However those pesky passengers convince him that they gotta leave the train, off they go, and they meet what kept the train peeps, a freaking werewolf! A decent werewolf tale, took it's time introducing characters and building tension, good effects, creature looked cool, funny at times and good acting. Worth checking out! If werewolf flicks are in your realm of fancy. Filmbufftim on FB."
" Stupid movie
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,1,"A stupid movie with lots of cringe...its a waste of time and totally nonsense.
Even this movie doesn't deserve 1 star."
" Decent enough by the numbers horror
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,6,"Standard horror film, doesn't do anything new or throw many surprises at you, but does do some small things well.The first 20 minutes set the scene quite well showing a broad cross section of today's society, one Each of a different type of person On this doomed train, and how they treat each other when things are normal, and then when things go wrong. character choices are confusing at times, The standard horror ""don't go over there alone!"" cliches are plentiful, but I've spent worse 90 minutes on films than this.Decent enough but ultimately not much to get excited about."
" Werewolves in (and around) London ain't what they used to be...
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,5,"Like most horror lovers, I'm crazy about werewolves. An adoration that got sparked by the legendary transformation scene in ""An American Werewolf in London"". But if you are really honest ... How many truly great werewolf movies are there? Maybe 10 or 15 over the course of cinematic history? In the past decade, I saw two very enjoyable titles (notably ""Lobos de Arga"" and ""Late Phases"") and had high hopes for a third one. The third one being ""Howl"", but it actually turned out a minor disappointment. The omens were nevertheless very positive: directed by make-up effects wizard Paul Hyett, who's first effort as a director ""The Seasoning House"" was quite solid, and a fantastically claustrophobic setting aboard a night train in the outskirts of London.There certainly isn't anything wrong in terms of body count, gore and make-up effects. The lycanthropes feasting their way through the train carriages full of nitwits look reasonably impressive, and they like their buffets messy and gooey. The problem merely lies with the ""nitwits"" and the script. Regrettably, this is yet another film full of dreadful clichÃ©s (people wandering off into the woods by themselves, etc...) and a cast full of annoying stereotypes (the dorky anti-hero, the fat football-fan, the fancy jerk, the elderly couple, ...). You simply don't feel much empathy for any of them, and the only more or less unpredictable thing about them is the order in which they die.A final word of advice: unless you have lived your entire life in London already, I strongly suggest purchasing a DVD-version with subtitles. I like to think of myself I speak and understand English fairly well, but I missed out on a good 20-30% of the dialogues because of heavy London accent/dialect."
" Definitely Won't be Riding a Train anytime soon.
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,4,Sort of a standard creature feature and somewhat entertaining but not that great. Didn't really make me feel for any of the characters. It Did make me see a few reasons why I'd never want to travel long distances on a train when there are plenty of perfectly good planes around!
" Disappointing, low budget, straight to video fare
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,4,"The themes, jump scares and screenplay are so predictable as a train leaves London Waterloo station and some time later comes to a shuddering halt in the middle of nowhere.The passengers (all 8 or so of them!) along with a hapless guard and trolley person come under attack from werewolf like creatures from the woods. Oh scary and so original!I found myself quite literally switching off concentration through boredom at the sheer monotony around the halfway stage. In my opinion avoid if at all possible."
" not bad for a pass time film ... quite entertaining
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,6,I'll do the negative first....I watched this because it said Sean pertwee was in it.... turns out he has a 2 minute part and I was gutted... he is such a good actor so it was a shame....I did not care about the characters accept for the train guard and the young guy with the fire sticksthe movie lacked the ability to get emotionally connectedNOW THE POSITIVESthe monsters are not too shabby for a low b rate horrorthe two young lads: the guard and the fire stick guy were really goodit was fun to watch and I'm glad I did watch itit was very realistic... train ticket that was extortionate in price... crappy train that had appalling toilets and was falling apart.. tired train guard.... aweful general public.... and because of this it gave me something to resonate with.... I've been on a train like this many times so for me I could really imagine being there...overall if you like b rate monsters then you will like this
" Not bad
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,5,"Nothing special here but it's fun. The acting is pretty good, the action is decent and the werewolves do their job. Worthy of a viewing."
" I don't know why I hate it, but I do.
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,4,"There's nothing particularly ""bad"" about this film. It's average in almost every way, although the concept is fairly interesting and the effects on the werewolves are pretty damn good. I just hated it, without reason. This rarely happens with me, but something about this just didn't sit right. I felt nothing for many of the characters; they just didn't feel like human beings to me. And that's it. I just didn't like the feeling of it."
" A werewolf movie with bite
",2020-03-04 00:00:00,8,"The staff and passengers on board a late night train out of London find themselves besieged by a pack of vicious werewolves after the train breaks down in the middle of nowhere.Director Paul Hyett relates the gripping story at a quick pace, adroitly crafts a creepy gloom-doom atmosphere, maintains a grimly serious take-no-prisoners tone throughout (this is one horror film that isn't afraid to bump off the more likeable characters), generates a substantial amount of nerve-wracking tension, and stages the savage attack scenes with go-for-the-throat skill and gusto. The sound acting by the capable cast helps a lot: Ed Speleers as meek conductor Joe, Holly Weston as sweet stewardess Ellen, Shauna Macdonald as the feisty Kate, Elliot Cowan as smarmy rich jerk Adrian, Amit Shah as the nerdy Matthew, Sam Gittins as the brave and resourceful Billy, Rosie Day as self-absorbed teen Nina, Duncan Preston as tough old man Ged, and Calvin A. Dean as tubby lunkhead Paul. Sean Pertwee pops up briefly as the ill-fated driver who gets killed first. The werewolves are quite ferocious and frightening. Kudos are also in order for Adam Biddle's sharp widescreen cinematography and the shuddery score by Paul Edward-Francis. Bloody good stuff."
" NOT REALLY
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,4,"Okay so, the idea was great, stuck on the train, hunted by werewolf family, BUT all of the character is stupid, somehow they made a stupid decision, and most of the char get panic out of nowhere, i mean u can get panic in that situation but theyre so idiot, too ignorant, the lady who got bite had weird symptoms, and didnt do something about it, if they dont want to kill her, at least put her on another cart, jeez, also the young girl and the laptop lady *sigh* whatever, the glasses guy, comeon dude, seriously? the old guy just ignorant af, the football dude, is he get high or something? those staff was idiot too, sorry to say, how in the hell, they choose or let the other to barricade that cart, why not the locomotive + the second cart? i think they barricade only the third or second, whichis still stupid for me, which mean the set was s*ck, the only char that did things right is the engineer guy, too sad they make him dead"
" A decent werewolf B-movie
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,6,"A night train from London to the boondocks breaks down as it passes through an isolated area and the ragtag group of passengers must face-off against a werewolf or four, or five, until the sun comes up. One of them is depressed train guard Joe, who is getting no respect from anyone and is unable to stand up for himself. It's thin characterisation, but it's the best the movie has to offer and Ed Speelers handles it well. The rest of the cast have little-to-nothing to work with, but it functions nonetheless.Taking cues from the Evil Dead, The Howling, From Dusk Til Dawn, Dog Soldiers, and even Resident Evil, which I think I caught a few recycled sound effects from. It doesn't have much of a voice of its own though, and fails to define itself or stand out from the (wolf) pack. For such a low budget the cinematography is pretty good, with some very atmospheric shots and a sense of abandon. I do with the interior of the train was a little better designed as it was a bit ugly to look at.If only the movie could have done something, anything to make it memorable. The isolated setting of the train is a great set-up, but the budget restricts the possibilities, and the pay-off is weak. A noble effort though."
" Low budget but ok
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,6,"Low budget British horror can spell disaster more often than not. This one gets by but by the strength of the cast. No big names but all put in a convincing shift were you are rooting for some and hope others get killed off.
A late night train is halted on the tracks and the driver gets out to investigate. The passangers are then prey for the predators outside hunting them.
Not in the same league as the brilliant dog soldiers but a good effort."
" Great beginning, bad ending
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,6,"Howl starts great - non standard situation, good display of characters, gradually growing the tension. In the middle the film promises to be a shining discovery...
... and then everything is ruined. The plot is sliding towards the banal development of a low grade zombie and vampire movie - everyone must die except one. And when in the ending... no, I will not spoil the film but... do you really think we deserve such childish ending?!"
" So they had me until the end...
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,4,"Kept my attention. Low budget, but done well. Then...the end. WTH? Clearly these wolves are people at some point, I figured they would give the mousy guard a second chance to be a bad a$$ wolf once a month, but no. Someone else mentioned this, which really ruined it too, they sun. It was freakin daylight and wolves are walking around?? Sorry guys, missed the mark."
" neat little werewolf flick
",2019-09-21 00:00:00,6,Pretty niche. It wasnt scary horror just action werewolf horror on a train in england. I would rate it on more of a made for tv horror level because it wasnt inventive or tried to do anything different. That said I was entertained. Id call it a 6 but not a 7 because they could have spent more time on the prosthetics. Not bad but subpar. The cgi stuff looked really nice.
" Excellent Werewolf movie!!!!
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the best werewolf movies I've ever seen. Great storyline w talented actors.
Definitely one I will buy."
" Solid werewolf horror
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,8,"I will be the first to admit, I usually shy away from any werewolf horror movie. They're usually just too unrealistic looking due to poor special effects and makeup, and the plots usually blow... Happy to say not the case with this one! Not only does the werewolf in this film come across as realistic, the setting of being stranded in the dark, foggy English countryside adds a major creep factor, the acting is far above average compared to most horror films, in the plot is actually good. As far as horror movies go, this is right up there with some of my favorite creature features and an overall good movie. A steady 'A' grade here from me. This one is good enough to at least give a shot. Definitely not a waste of time (unlike a great many horror movies unfortunately) by any means!"
" Good start, horrible from the middle
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,3,"The movie is full of unrealistic behavior displayed by people who are facing danger.The acting was OKish. Nothing very good, but ok.I will now describe the whole plot, spoiling it and highlighting how bad it is.The cast: Male and female conductors. An old couple. The annoying hipster. The working lady. The mechanic. The Indian. The playboy. The fat guy.The movie starts great by introducing the characters by the male conductor going through the train asking for tickets. One lady with a dog was introduced here, and never seen again after this scene. She was literally pointless to the plot of this movie, and I guess the director felt the same, mid filming. Then the train stops in the middle of nowhere and after a while, upon finding out that rescue is 4 hours away, the playboy suggests that everyone instead walks to the next station, he even suggests that they might get telephone reception back by then. This is where the movie stops being good.They go out, encounter a beast in the woods, run back to the train. Old lady gets bitten in the leg, but survives the encounter. They find that fat man was locked in a jammed washroom this whole time. They tell him what they encountered outside, and he reacts as realistic as a cartoon character would, stating that he cannot believe what he heard, that he missed his stop while being locked in the washroom. I could hear a ba dum tsssss in the background.The characters wait for an hour hiding from the beast in the train wagons. Then, somehow, hipster girl gets a phone call and gets snagged by the warewolf through the window. Remember when the playboy said they might get phone reception again if they walk towards the next station? Inconsistent writing.Ok, they just lost hipster girl through a very gory event. No more joking around. They decide to barricade the windows...with tools, which include axes... They were attacked by a beast, hid from it, and no one thought of weapons. Then, after using the tools to barricade themselves, they forget about the axes again.Fat man cannot stand holding it in though, so he HAS to go to the washroom again, without telling anyone no less, beasts or no beasts, consequences be damned. The rest of the passengers notice fat man is not there and male conductor finds him in the washroom, which is in the next wagon, right outside the wagon they barricaded. Its the same washroom with the jammed door he was found in. The ridiculousness of this scene is unaccaptable. The beast finds out and tries to get fat man through the roof of the wagon, shredding it to bits, DESPITE a window being available and him already successfully getting hipster girl through a window before! Beast kills fat man and decides to go in and kill the rest. It backfires and the terrified passengers almost kill the beast with improvised weapons, including pipes, and fire extinguishers, and when they almost finish it off, the Indian comes with the axe to finish it off! That axe is an elusive creature in this horror movie, never there when it's needed.After this they discover that it's a warewolf, and based on howling, that there are more of them! Waiting will not get them anywhere, so they decide to try to fix the train. Two characters go out. The mechanic, and the Indian. The mechanic explains to the conductors what to do when he fixes the train, it's literally 3 instructions, and BOTH conductors stay in the driver's cabin to wait for the signal. Why? One of them was not needed there. Were 3 moves too much to memorize?Back to the mechanic and Indian. The Indian, despite offering to be the lookout doesn't look around as the mechanic is under the train trying to locate the fault. Despite being 2 meters away from brushes form which a warewolf could attack at any moment, he drops the axe on the ground, crouches, and holds the flashlight for the mechanic, while looking also at what the mechanic is looking at. Illogical behavior considering what they saw and know is around them. Suddenly, the Indian hears a whispering plea for help out of the woods. Without feeling the need to tell anything to the mechanic, he takes the axe and enters the forest, leaving the mechanic alone. The cries are from hipster girl! She survived, despite losing half a bucket of blood during the scene when she was taken. She survived for at least 2 hours, and when she is found, a warewolf was eating her organs, while she is still clearly whispering for help, no gurgling of blood or anything, barely an inconvenience! WTF?! Adults wrote and directed this BS! Anyway, the Indian dies there, but the mechanic repairs the train and it starts moving. Despite that, the warewolves manage to keep up with the moving train before it stops again. It's as if it didn't move. Old woman turns to warewolf due to bite mark and kills old man. Conductors kill old woman. Playboy decides to try to run while sacrificing the conductors, by locking them up in the train with the warevolves and taking his chances with the forest. Just as the conductors are about to be killed, the mechanic comes to their rescue and keeps the warevolves at bay with flames. The mechanic gives a crowbar to the conductors and tells them to open the locked door, while he holds the warewolves off in front of him. They open the door, go through it, and you know what the mechanic does? He turns his BACK to the warewolves as he tries to follow the conductors, instead of leaving while moving backwards and still facing the danger. Mechanic dies.So we are left with the 2 conductors running through a well lit black and white forest. Seriously, it feels like they decided to shoot the movie in one night and since they couldn't, when dawn came in, they thought they could hide the light with a filter? So the male conductor decides to stop, and talk to the female conductor for 20 seconds how they can't run away, and that she should run. There is literally no visible reason for him to think they cannot make it at that point. It feels like he is insisting to die, forced by the plot. Speaking of forcing, he almost forces a kiss on the female conductor. While it was hinted that he likes her, there was no reason for her to accept the kiss at a time when both of them are supposedly being chased by bloodthirsty beasts! The female conductor finally accepts his proposal and continues running down a trail, which is still surrounded by forest, and she is running away from beasts who kept up with a moving train. OK. Male conductor dies. She despite the odds, gets away.It's early morning, maybe 5 am at this time judging by the light. Seriously, you can see that sunlight is out. We see playboy who tried to sacrifice the conductors is walking through the forest, talking as if he didn't just face something that would scar a man for life and rob him of his senses, promising he will buy the forest and burn it, when he gets surrounded BY THE WAREWOLVES, IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, one of them the turned male conductor!Horrible! I regret watching it. I am not a movie director or a screen writer, but I, and most people who see this, could have done better."

" Good ""Werewolves on a Train"" flick, but no depth or moral
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,6,"When a train in England is forced to make an emergency stop in a notorious forest, the passengers have to work together to survive the night against a pack of... werewolves.""Howl"" (2015) is an English production that combines the werewolves of ""Howling VI: The Freaks"" (1991) and ""Dog Soldiers"" (2002) with the train survival situation of ""Short Walk to Daylight"" (1972); the British countryside and characters also bring to mind ""Dog Soldiers."" While the plot is naturally reminiscent of ""Horror Express"" (1972), ""Howl"" isn't really like that movie mostly due to the modern setting (the events in ""Horror Express"" take place just after the Victorian Era in 1906).It's an effective werewolf flick and good in many ways, but there's no meat on the bones. In the end it's pointless. But maybe that's the nihilistic non-message? There are three fairly worthy women, but the creators never really take advantage of their presence.The film runs 1 hour, 29 minutes and was shot in Black Park Country Park, Buckinghamshire, England and London (train interiors and station).GRADE: B- (6/10)"
" The mundane British Rail journey is turned it into a feast of B movie horror.
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,5,"A decent direct-to-video British indie horror movie directed by Paul Hyett. A bunch of obnoxious passengers get on board the last train out of London and get stranded in a remote forest after hitting something on the tracks, pretty soon they find themselves being picked off by a pack of ravenous lycanthropes. Ed Speleers from Downton Abbey is the put upon train conductor who is always getting trampled on by people, forced to become a hero when he has to meet challenges that weren't in his job description. Sean Pertwee (from the much better Dog Soldiers) cameos as the train driver who is the first to die. There are some decent twists towards the end, including a passenger who becomes infected after being bitten and turns into a werewolf, and an instant karma style ending which sees a selfish passenger get his come uppance. There are a few decent gory special effects, but the werewolves are a real let down, and the movie would have been more effective if they had stayed hidden from the audience. Also starring Shauna Macdonald who played the lead role Sarah in The Descent. Howl had no theatrical release, but was shown at a number of international film festivals before its release on home video. The Horror Addict channel on YouTube premiered the official trailer, and the video currently has almost two and a half million views."
" My worst nightmare!!!!!!
",2019-04-18 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie, maybe not box office hit, but was very enjoyable. I just imagined I was in their predicament and I was scared to death. Just think about it, out in the middle of no where, and no one to help you."
" AN EXCELLENT WEREWOLF SURVIVE THE NIGHT HORROR & MY FAVOURITE WEREWOLF FILM!!!
",2019-04-12 00:00:00,8,"""Howl"" was excellent & really well made & really well directed, it reminded me of an updated version of an old fashioned 70's Hammer Horror film, it had that real British Horror feel & that's a good thing along with the tense Atmosphere.
""Howl"" is really a fun throwback to creature feature seige films such as ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (1996) it's got similar themes like in ""Dusk Till Dawn"" the group are trapped in a bar with vampires trying to get in & eat everyone & in ""Howl"" it's werewolves trying to get into a broken down train & eat everyone, the wolf creatures look similar to the vamps in Dusk Till Dawn intentional or not?
But it's all done really well with a cast of very ordinary average people on the late train & get stuck on the track accross some mountains & big forests, with mist & fog floating about & that's one of the best shots of the movie as it gives it that classic old school Horror look & atmosphere.The cast are all ok just very average folk & that's fine that gives it that natural real & raw quality when they start to get attacked , the wolf creatures look fantastic & all old school practical FX & thank goodness for that as these creatures look so scary & so cool, like they used to in films like Joe Dante's ""The Howling""(1981) ""Dog Soldiers"" (2001) & ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (1996) so it's made in that great mould.
The siege aspect is very exciting, intense & scary i mean massive terrifying wolf like creatures surrounding a broken down train in the middle of a stormy foggy night is pure Horror delight, i TOTALLY enjoyed the hell out of it.""Howl"" is an excellent survive the night Horror film with excellent creatures so if you love Horror films or creature features is a great mix.
This has become my favourite ""Werewolf"" movie!!!"
" A werewolf horror movie!!
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,5,"This is a horror movie about some train passengers attacked by a bunch of werewolves. To start with the concept and story is good but the execution could've been better. The movie has some nice scenes. Acting is good, screenplay could've been better and you can feel that the movie diverts from the topic. Background music supports the ongoing scenario. Film makers are continuing the same decade old theories of turning into creature after bitten by them and this is turning monotonous. Overall this is a nice horror movie which could've been better."
" Good werewolf films are hard to find but this is one
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,8,"Everything ericnolan said: good traditional werewolf story (but original setting), good acting, good direction. Best new werewolf film i've seen since Dog Soldiers."
" Bad really bad
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,1,Worst movie I have ever seen..makes hammer films of the 60s and 70s look special..cannot recommend
" Hilariously trash
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,5,"This very low budget, low rent offering manages to make Dog Soldiers look like a serious award winner. There is nothing logical about thus poorly thought out tripe.
The British rail transport system still manages to be more horrific.
By the way I still found it fun."
" Pretty good actually
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,7,"Pretty chilling and pretty scary if you watch at night, i gotta say the CGI was kinda good, the acting is not that bad but i still think they should improve it a bit more, entertaining too, somewhat predictable, i'll say the movie got me entertained, but how the werewolves attack was goofy, they should improve that, thou it wasn't that bad, i'm gonna give this a 7.7/10"
" Howl
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,5,"The last train at night out of London Waterloo breaks down in a dark wood infected by werewolves - blood letting follows.Despite a few gaping plot holes and some just about ok werewolves, this is quite enjoyable, though unremarkable low budget gory British horror fare. The sterling British cast of a hundred Midsomer Murders and Poirot episodes are good fun and overall this cheap Hammer Horror / Doctor Who hybrid is definitely worth a watch after a few beers on a Friday night"
" Mediocre movie.
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,5,"I would say that more or less everything in this movie were mediocre: The script, acting, special effects and more or less everything else. On top of that a couple of things annoyed me, as when the people in the movie tried to block a pair of sliding doors with a wrench through the door handles! Not only once, but TWICE!! How on earth did anyone during the making of this movie think that this could in any way lock sliding doors, and how is it that NO ONE pointed this out during the making/editing of the movie??For me the transformation into werewolves in this movie did not fit into the timeline of previously established mythology. And since when did canines have eyes that glows in the dark like cat eyes??? Deviations from ""facts"" like this irritates me a little bit. At least as long as the deviations are not justified and explained.But in the end the movie was OK to watch. And in spite of everything, I developed a sympathy for most of the characters in the movie, and timed passed reasonably quick (and considering the relative short time this movie lasts, it would have been really bad if it had felt long...)."
" A refreshing and more unique werewolf film
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,7,"I feel that this movie is underrated. It doesn't have the greatest set of actors or the best visual effects, but I felt that its premise and werewolf design were unique. I wasn't expecting too much coming into this film, but I was pleasantly surprised by itI love werewolf movies and this was something I hadn't seen in that genre before. The premise is a late night train in England breaks down in the middle of the woods, and the staff and passengers are slowly hunted down by an unknown creature (werewolf).The design of the werewolves in this film were like ones I hadn't seen before. They don't appear very wolf-like or have much fur. They look more like mutated humanoids with stretched out skin and long, thinning hair on their heads. They have large, canine-like legs. They have long, bony fingers with claws, pointed ears, and large fangs. Their faces mostly resemble a human's but with wrinkled skin and yellow eyes.I definitely recommend giving this movie a watch."
" Howwwwwl! Is excellent
",2018-12-21 00:00:00,8,This movie is like Train to Busain with werewolves.
" I Didn't Care Whether They Lived or Died
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,5,"The plot was OK but the problem with this film is most of the passengers were rude and selfish, making it difficult to care whether they lived or died. Combine that with the stupid decisions they make, the film fails to rise above mediocrity."
" 45 minutes in ""Do you have any tools on this train""
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,5,"Is probably my favourite line in this film as it gave me such a belly-laugh. A very real ""duh"" moment to be true.Having said that, a film that was competently put together and with some really fun special effects, so that it's flaws of storytelling and VERY basic premise are disguised just enough for you to enjoy it.This is a good film if you're eating takeout with a couple of beers.As Ric Mayall once said - Bottom fish banana. Etc..."
" Nice suprise...
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,7,"...this movie become, seeing note 5 didnt expect much but it's really good. not bad special effects, not too annoying characters and story make it one of best werewolf movie in recent years."
" Could be so much better.
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,4,"When I first heard of this film I was intrigued. Werewolves on a train sounded like a great concept. This concept is also set up well in the first act; but unfortunately the interesting film that had just been set up is dropped and exchanged for laziness. It's almost as if they just gave up half way through the film.The cinematography is good for the most part; but, the lazy story, the terrible acting, the bad continuity and the terrible werewolf designs really let's this film down. What starts off as an interesting film, turns into a lazy, funny and just plain awful film.
Do not watch this. It will get your hopes up and then crush them."
" Could have been better.
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,4,"This film has an interesting concept, that is set up fairly well in the first act (if not a bit slowly). When I first heard of this film it sounded really interesting but upon watching it, it is truly terrible. It's almost as if the people making this film gave up half way through. Don't bother with this film; it has an interesting idea, done with a poor and lazy attitude."
" Great start, but dwindles very fast.
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,4,"After a brilliantly suspenseful first half, the film deteriorates into silliness. All the characters act stupidly, which is just not normal behavior, and the creatures are more comical than scary. (Great tension and atmosphere in the first half)."

The rest of the crew and passengers then attempt to survive the onslaught of the creatures.People are dragged through windows, after being bitten an old woman turns into a Werewolf. Blood, guts, limbs are thrown about. The Werewolves are more human-like in this case but having wolves teeth and triple jointed legs. In the early stages of transformation they look more like Zombies.Directed by Paul Hyett known mostly for his special make up effects on Doomsday, The Children and The Descent.

" I CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED MY STOP
",2018-04-19 00:00:00,7,"Joe (Ed Speleers) is the guard or conductor on a midnight train out of London. We discover he was passed over for a promotion and is working a double shift. After we get 10 minutes of his boring character, we get to know the passengers by his brief encounters as he checks their tickets. It is a rainy night. There is a full moon and Joe doesn't get any respect from his passengers ""why don't you get a real job.""The train is soon forced to a stop, surrounded by woods. We anticipate the struggle that is about to commence and have already decided who we want to see die first and survive. The DVD cover reveals the face of the creature described as a werewolf in the write-up. In reality it is more like an Urak-hai Orc with the face of a Morlock and wolf legs. You will get to see plenty of it, just hang in there.

" 3 jointed men..
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,4,"I will be honest any British horror movie is one that always leaves the mind wondering. But I'd say give it a go if you have LITERALLY NOTHING ELSE to watch. The ""wolves"" look more like Hagravens from Skyrim. But as I said if it's a last resort watch it, but fuel it with alcohol as it is needed!"
" british werewolves attack passengers on a train
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,8,"I found this film by chance, and was very pleased, asi like werewolves and i like trains. spoiler alert. this film is simple, but effective, follows the myth of the were wolf, loosely, but to good effect, its as good as dog soldiers ,which also like, has many different characters who react in different ways, not always predictable. well filmed, didnt feel cheap and the acting is good for a horror film,i plan to buy the dvd, to keep it in my collection"
" Spoilers follow ...
",2017-10-11 00:00:00,8,"This is a terrific production. Constantly under-valued Joe is given guard duties on a train. Despite being told he gets on well with passengers, when he checks the tickets, he is met by the kind of casual ignorance and rudeness you would expect from the complaining, self-obsessed, terminally dissatisfied general public. The train driver is played by Sean Pertwee in little more than a cameo, and he is the first victim of the howling horrors 'out there' in the night that seemingly cause the train to halt in the middle of nowhere. That the miscreants appear to be werewolves is bad news for Pertwee, who has previous form with lycanthropes (1994's 'Dog Soldiers').Ed Speleers is excellent as Joe, whose wearisome tolerance of his increasingly dire situation is written in the wrinkles on his forehead. He clearly wants to be somewhere â€“ anywhere â€“ else, from the get-go, and our sympathies are with him. This is particularly apparent in his relationship with tea-trolley girl Ellen (Holly Weston), who â€“ alongside the rest of the passengers â€“ is constantly being charmed by the authoritative clever-clogs Adrian (Elliot Cowan), who always seems to do and say the right thing. For a while at least.Other passengers include a teen girl who uses accusations of sexual impropriety to get her own way, Duncan Preston as the elderly Ged whose patience is constantly wearing thing and an overweight man who is never quite aware of what is happening around him. These characters are believable and very well played. And they all have no truck with poor Joe. The courteous and polite Matthew is the exception, and Amit Shah's playing of him losing his composure and killing the first of the creatures we see is very powerful. Jenny, Ged's wife, is also very well played by Ania Marson.Visually, the were-beasts are sometimes very impressive and sometimes not so much. However, they thoroughly convince as virtually unstoppable, rampaging killers. In the darkness of the wilderness surrounding the stranded train, they are exceptional with glowing eyes and shaggy manes.As a whole, I had a great time watching this. It is a good, solidly made traditional werewolf/horror picture, beautifully directed by Paul Hyett. Some people may be irked that more wasn't revealed about why and how the pack exist undetected in the English countryside, but the lack of explanation doesn't bother me at all, especially when the results are this good."
" Good werewolf movie
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,7,"I don't know why Howl is described as being fantasy, comedy, horror here on IMDb - it's a HORROR film, and a damn good one at that! I like that the film makers have been creative with the creatures, but I don't like Sean Pertwee's part being nothing more than a cameo, despite star billing."
" Werewolf movie that is out of the ordinary.
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,7,"Attention, spoilers ahead...This is a good movie for suspense, but some of the things in this really don't add up. The movie lets viewers know that the moon is responsible for what is happening, just like any other werewolf movie, but what doesn't add up is that after night wears on the creatures are still creatures. What is the point of showing the moon as the culprit reason when the creatures don't resort back to human. Otherwise, great movie with loaded horror and classic horror."
" What a waste
",2017-05-26 00:00:00,1,"I should have known it would turn out to be a lousy film when they killed off Sean Pertwee in act one, without giving him a single line of dialogue. How do you put the star of Dog Soldiers in a werewolf film and dispose of him like that? I have a theory: they didn't have the money to actually pay him to play a proper role and they just wanted his name for the DVD cover to try and sell it.That's pretty naughty, and unnecessary. Instead of tricking the audience they should have got someone to fix their stupid script. That would have worked better.You see, this film started well, and it really had promise. The cinematography was adequate. It gave the film a dreamlike, spooky feel, which I liked a lot. The lead character was likable. The set was pretty basic, but persuasive, and perfect for the plot. Then the monster appeared and seemed scary enough. There even came a nice twist: they actually kill the monster early in act two. That's pretty original. And no, it does not come back to life. It is really dead.But it is at this point that whoever wrote the script ran out of ideas, and bad, boring, and irritating clichÃ©s followed one after another. Also, the tone was shattered and the audience became confused as to where the film was going. As it turned out, it was not going anywhere. The third act confused us even more instead of wrapping things up in a satisfying way.There is some pointless and badly done character development, a lot of confusing actions undertaken by the protagonists, the introduction of new monsters, which didn't work well at all, the unbelievably irritating clichÃ© whereby a bitten person transforms into a werewolf while everyone remains in denial about what's happening to that person even as it starts to growl and grow monster teeth... I was hoping the film would be intelligent enough to at least treat these clichÃ©s with irony. Alas, it did not happen. There is also a 'bad guy' who is as weak a character as all the others, and doesn't really do anything. And as for the protagonist, who everyone expects to undergo the obvious arc from a cowardly loser to a tough guy in control of his life... It doesn't really happen, and he ends up dead.I really thought this film would make up for the lack of budget with some intelligent and innovative plot twists. Unfortunately, it derailed early in act two and kept getting worse and worse until the very last scene. It boggles the mind, really, because any decent scriptwriter would have written a better script. I would have done it for less money than they paid Pertwee to show up in a single scene."
" Quite Scary and Watchable
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,7,"Howl is a good horror flick at least until the end where it got predictable and weak yet it engages you nevertheless. Any effects or makeup used are also done quite realistically. Probably the best performance among the characters would be Elliot Cowan as the cocky, selfish Adrian and even Ania Marson as the frail Jenny. The thick forest, a full moon, a train stuck at the tracks, the howls..all are captured so well to add to the spook factor. Few scenes lack conviction, for example initially the werewolves are unable to open the train doors but they do it easily later in the movie. And as told earlier, the climax could have been as tense as the rest of the movie. Yet, this movie is very watchable, grab your popcorn :)"
" Where's the chihuahua?
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,4,"This clunker runs through the usual clichÃ©s, from everybody making the absolutely wrong decision (like splitting up and walking into the woods alone)to the cell phones not working. But the only interesting thing is . . .SPOILER: An entire car of people just vanishes like Richie Cunningham's older brother. The ticket agent/guard walks through the cars and in one of them meets two young women, a vanilla dude, and an old bag with an angry dog. After the train stops, those folks are never again seen, just written out of the script. They aren't attacked, as ALL of the passengers meet up front to yell at the crew, except these four are nowhere to be seen, long gone before any monster shows up. Little things like that are a distraction. Makes this '6' movie a '4'."
" Just like the good old days...
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,6,"""Howl"" is a glorious return to the old school type of werewolf movie, and it was definitely a return to the ways when werewolf movies were made efficiently and interestingly.Now, while starts out fairly slow, don't give up on the movie easily, because it takes a little while for it to get up into gear. But once it has gotten in gear, it sky rockets off for a thrill ride of great speed and with lots of thrills and excitement.The atmosphere that director Paul Hyett managed to establish in ""Howl"" was just phenomenal. There is a real sense of dread and fear permeating the movie, especially as the werewolves close in on the individuals trapped in the train. And the fact that most of the movie takes place in the small confined space of a train just adds to the atmosphere and to the sense of claustrophobia and despair.As for the story in ""Howl"", well it was quite straight forward. It seemed like it was an homage to the classic werewolf movies; the movies that I grew up with and loved. So it was particularly great to watch ""Howl"".The effects in the movie were quite good, and again really captured the essence of the way Hollywood used to make werewolf movies. So it was indeed a treat to behold on the screen. And the werewolves actually had quite an interesting conceptual design, and the special effects team managed to create something really great.They also had a pretty good ensemble of cast to portray the various characters and roles in the movie. I enjoyed watching Sean Pertwee in yet another werewolf movie, although it was a shame that he was not one of the main cast and only had a smaller role in the movie.""Howl"" turned out to be quite a nice surprise of a movie, and it is definitely a worthy addition to the werewolf genre. If you haven't seen ""Howl"" already and if you enjoy the werewolf movies from the 1980s and 1990s, then ""Howl"" will definitely appeal to you."
" Not Quite There
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,6,"I wanted to really love this movie, from other reviews I'd read, it seemed like I would. But alas, I didn't. However, nor did I hate it. The setting was creepy - you can't get better than an English forest for a werewolf setting, but the filmmakers didn't utilize it as much as they could have, probably due to budgetary and scheduling constraints - it's tough and time consuming to do too many setups in a forest (I've been there and done that, so I can talk from experience). I also think they spent too much time on the bickering passengers. I understand that they were trying to develop characters and create tension, but in the end, the tension should have been derived more from the attacking creatures. The in-fighting of the passengers just got annoying in the end. After all, we know most of these people were just meat for the beast so who cares that much about them? And really, if this happened in reality, I think folks would very quickly realize that something supernatural was happening and get serious. The last thing that bothered me was, although the creatures were cool and horrifying, they did not look so much like werewolves except for their feet. They resembled a cross between Nosferatu and a Chupacabra. And I think that if you're making a werewolf picture, your monsters should be traditional. All in all though, I'm glad I've got this in my collection."
" Delayed due to werewolves on the line.
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,7,"Every carriage is a buffet car for a pack of werewolves when a red-eye train from Waterloo comes to a sudden halt on the track, having hit a stag. Down on his luck guard Joe (Ed Speleers) tries to keep his passengers calm while the driver (Sean Pertwee) inspects the damage, but finds his job more stressful than usual when the lycanthropes lurking in the woods launch an attack.There are several moments in Howl where one cannot help but roll their eyes, far-fetched elements including the barricading of a carriage using some handy dandy tools, an engineering student who knows how to operate and repair a train, and one dumb sap who wanders off into his fog shrouded surroundings because he hears a plaintive cry for help (needless to say, he doesn't make it back alive).In its favour, however, are a well-drawn cast of characters, plenty of tense action and atmosphere, a reasonable amount of blood and gore, and some of the most impressive looking cinematic werewolves since Neil Marshall's Dog Soldiers: ugly buggers with glowing eyes, massive maws full of razor sharp teeth, manky skin and matted fur, realised by an effective mix of practical makeup and CGI. So while the script might not rewrite the rules, Howl still has lots to recommend it."
" I'm speechless
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,10,"In my opinion its really amazing i can admit that. And its keeping me 'breathless' on my seat, and i couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!! i couldn't even imagine how will i survive in that condition and its just... AMAZING!! I'm really surprised for the ending,its really unexpected to see. During i'm watching the movie, my mind are full of curiosity about how will it goes. I felt like i'm in that kind of situation and it makes me jump in my seat all the time, if i would be one of cinematic critics, i would give an enormous stars and comments:) just to say that kind of frightening a bit, because i always look at my window all the time. STAY AWESOME!!! :)"
" Less ""howl,"" more ""yawn""
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,4,"Unconvincing horror movie about train passengers stuck on a train stopped in a supposed forest, set upon by a band of werewolves. Or something like werewolves -- it's not exactly clear what these creatures are, nor where they come from, nor how they manage to survive in what looks more like a tame park than wilderness. Given that England obliterated most of its forests centuries ago, it can be challenging to execute the human vs. nature motif in films set there, but lots of movies have managed it nicely, from some Hammer horror films to ""An American Werewolf in London."" This one doesn't quite manage it. Unfortunately, it doesn't manage much else either, except a few tense scenes from time to time. The actors, led by ""Downton Abbey""'s Ed Speleers. do what they can to breath some individuality into the stock characters they are stuck playing, but the script, the direction and even the costuming don't do much to make any of them memorable or interesting. I found it difficult to work up much concern about whether the mostly likable characters lived or the mostly unlikable characters died.There are, at least, some decent production values and some good moments when the action ramps up. You have to sit through a slow start which, in a better movie, would be spent establishing something unique about the various assorted train passengers and crew, and a lot of wheel-spinning. The creature design is fine, but not so inspired as to make this a must-see for creature feature fans. All in all, while mildly and intermittently entertaining, this is a big ""meh."""
