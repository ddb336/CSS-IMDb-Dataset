" An Interesting Adaptation from the Short Film
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,7,They have stretched the horror short into a feature length film here and done it well enough to keep you interested. The characters are solid and the relationship between the mother and daughter and the younger brother is well developed enough to keep you involved in the story. The concept of a creature that can only be see in the dark is original enough to make this worth a watch. While its not as satisfying as some horror films it is definitely an interesting addition to the genre and worth a watch at least once.
" The ghost was terrified
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,9,"Simple plot and good enough to be understandable. Teresa Palmer & Gabriel Bateman did an amazing performance on this film.Creepy and the ghost was very scary, but this film was too short, an extra 20-30 minutes will be better,yet this is still a great horror film."
" Great movie
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,9,"Teresa Palmer and Mr. Bateman's chemistry adds to this film a lot, and side character Bret is awesome, look at all the things he does to fight Diana. This movie is great"
" Decent enough
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,6,Decent enough movie just feels like a rip off of darkness falls.similar story
" Afraid of the dark?
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,6,"The fact that this was produced from a short film I saw on youtube, it's pretty awesome. The premise regarding the entity that haunts the characters is rather weak and unforgiveable. Unfortunately this drags the movie down a lot. However, the acting is great all around and peoples reactions seemed realistic with an unnerving feeling throughout. The scares were great and for the most part very creative. Teresa Palmer is a decent actress that doesn't get a lot of quality roles that exploit her potential but she does well here. Maria Bello feels authentic as the disturbed parent and the son carries his scenes with dignity. If you want a horror to watch, this is proof that they don't need to be R rated to achieve a good scare."
" Better Than Most
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,9,I really liked this movie. Great characters and a fun plot. I have to give points to this movie for actually developing the characters and giving them a little bit more depth than the average horror flick. It's nice to root for the main characters for once. Minus a star for the jump-scare-apaloozafest but it's definitely worth it.
" Pretty good
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,7,"The idea of the film is that there is a creature that has some kind of longstanding connection to Rebecca and Martin's mother Sophie. This horrifying entity only becomes visible when there is darkness. If there is light upon it then it suddenly disappears. Undoubtedly the creature is creepy and is actually quite an interesting character. It provides us with a few jump scares and has a fairly intriguing back story. Unfortunately the film (at 81m) was perhaps at least 15-20 mins too short. It left me with unanswered questions about where the entity originally came from and also the background of Sophie, which I'd really liked to have known more about. I think if we did have that extra back story then it would have made for a much clearer movie. Maria Bello obviously being the biggest name in the film lived up to that with a pretty good performance. I just wish there was more of her character and her relationship with the entity. A minor issue is the editing. There were a few other moments where things were jumping randomly from scene to scene. I was also never sure what the movie wanted to be. On the whole, Lights Out had the potential to be pretty scary, and to some extent it was. The original idea was good, unfortunately it was all let down by being a bit too short."
" Very classy
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,4,"Lights out is usually every child's first fear! And we usually grow up with it, and yet as an adult when you hear a noise or see something sketchy you turn on the lights, for a clearer view and a better understanding of the situation!
Unfortunately this film, turned on the light to our first childhood fear by explaining it all the way through! Once you know what that is, its not a horror movie anymore! It may makes you jump but its just a sound effect! Or in another word, it doesnt leave a scar! You wont get paranoid, or your imaginations wont be effected! Its almost like a re assurance!
If it wasnt for a good acting, i wouldnt even leave 4 stars rating!"
" VERY VERY VERY AWFUL
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,6,"Light ... black ... light ... black ... light ... black. The fear of the dark pure and simple! So the story is based on that! I find it just a shame that they do not fully explain the reason for this ""Monster""."
" A jump scare classic
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,7,"If your looking for suspense, a twisted story line and an eerie feel. This film is perfect."
" I thought it was okay
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,7,"I was entertained because usually when I watch ""the conjuring"" or some horror films like that, personally I am bored and I feel like it's whatever but this movie was fun (in my opinion anyways)I do think the ending lacked a bit? I felt like it was kind of anti climatic but it was alright, would give it a watch if you haven't watched it but I wouldn't watch it again if someone offered me to"
" Amazing!
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,10,As a horror fanatic I can easily say THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING FILM! It GENUINELY scared me. That is VERY rare!
" Good PG-13 Horror Movie
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,7,"This movie is terrifying! It has a original premise and it builds and builds upon that premise. It doesn't under-do it, nor does it overdo it. It's just right. I do have one thing bad to say about it though, the jumpscares get tiring after a while. At first, they are genuinely scary, but then they just start using the same jumpscare over and over again. The only thing different about each one is the setting it's in, also the person the antagonist is jumpscaring. Other than that though, it is a good movie that I highly suggest."
" Mega spooky
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,10,"This film delivers right from the start. Instead of relying upon special effects to make it's point it relies on good storytelling, superb acting and great filming.Who hasn't been afraid of the dark at some point in their life; especially when they were a kid. This plays on that old fear engrained in mankind, it is truly spooky and delivers the scares.Took me back to childhood and growing up in a very frightening, large, Victorian house, which I am convinced was haunted. This is definitely worth watching. If you like horror and your ghost stories you will like this. You may have to sleep with the lights on after though."
" Please do not go by the negative reviews and watch before judging it
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,8,"Lights out is a Horror mystery movie directed by David F. Sandberg and stars Teresa Palmer, Gabriel Bateman, Maria Bello and Billy Burke.After seeing the movie i was not able to understand such a low rating of this movie on IMDB as this is one of the best horror movie i have seen in recent times. I also started watching the movie with least exception but the movie had proved me wrong.The plot of the movie is good and the execution is superb, the screenplay is tight and will keep you holding throughout the scenes. The best part of the movie is that it doesn't wastes much time in reveling the plot and starts very early. Mostly jump scares is used to terrify and to scare and is used perfectly. Acting is also great and every character were very well written and enacted.The cinematography is good and the climax is strong with a great ending. If you loves jump scares movies, this movie is for you. A Must watch."
" A ""nice"" horror movie.
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,7,"Lights out is all about darkness of fear the concept is good and the story as well
In the movie Diana (ghost) like to stay in the darkness and gets connect to the lady (Sophie). diana doesn't wanna leave her I must say this is nice horror film some scenes are really creepy which will definitely make scare you."
" Fun Watch but Nothing Special
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,6,It's a fun horror flick that doesn't try to get to cute or smart with it's premise. There aren't any extremely memorable or shocking moments. It's mostly jump scares and a typical shadowy supernatural figure doing ghost things. Rules are laid out for how the entity-thing can interact with the characters and it doesn't really stray from that. The ending wrapped everything up all nice and neat with a bow on top which was disappointing.
" Stellar Film!
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,9,"I love this movie! It never gets boring! The only thing I didn't particularly like is how it ended so abruptly. Other than that, it's amazing! It was very surprising and I just love it. I'm not even very into movies like that. I have almost all good things to say! Would recommend!"
" Pretty good chiller
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,7,"Produced by James Wan, this has that 'Conjuring Universe' feel (although it isn't). Cool premise (the entity can only be glimpsed when the lights are out) and some good performances. Feels a bit rushed towards the end (the running time is pretty short - 77 min; it could have easily used another 10 minutes) and the resolution is weak compared to the build-up. Good effects. 7/10 Apparently there's a sequel in the works."
" Engaging Enough Horror Flick
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,6,"Lights Out is a short film premise stretched to nearly the breaking point, but a fine performance by Maria Bello helps things moving along at a decent clip and some of the scares are very effective. Like most horror films, the film gets a little more dull and less frightening once they reveal the reasons as to why this spirit is haunting them, but it's not enough to cancel out all the good that came before it. It's not one you have to run and see, but it's also not something you'd change the channel on if it popped up on TV."
" Bad plot
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,2,The plot was lackluster. They had terrible character development and not much really happened. Wouldn't reccomend.
" Loved it
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,8,"Lights Out was great. I started watching movie with least expectations (mainly after seeing mixed reviews) but it was much more than my expectations. I totally enjoyed it.This movie will get your pulse up fast, revealing the ""horror"" very early on. Interestingly enough, it keeps that pulse up throughout the movie despite of this. The concept of something that can only appear and be seen if it's dark is bound to lead to a jump scare whenever it appears. Towards the end you've almost gotten so used to it that the scare effect wears off a bit, and is one of two reason I don't rank this a 10. But thanks to a good story and good actors, the movie still holds its ground to the very end.The characters are really good, well written and performed. The plot has some weight and emotion to it, and with a solid ending that wraps things up in a much more satisfying way.All in all you get everything you want from a jump scare movie with Lights Out, with a good plot and good actors that deliver, and a scare factor we all can relate to."
" If you're a horror fan, Lights Out is a must watch.
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,8,"In terms of acting, Teresa Palmer was the standout in this movie acting as the older sister to a young boy (Gabriel Bateman, who was equally great) plagued by his mother's demons. The fact that the entity had to avoid light added another layer of complexity, as the constant darkness created continuing paranoia throughout the movie. It was nice they were able to pack plenty of good, quality scares into such a short runtime. Another aspect of the movie that stood out to me was the fantastic sound design. Everything from Diana's voice, to the scratching on the floor sounded as creepy as possible. I'm not always a fan of backstories for villains, but in this case the backstory helped elevate Diana's character by giving her more depth. David Sandberg also did a great job of creating tension between family members to isolate them during some of the most chilling points of the movie. To me he's proved to be one of the best horror directors in the business after coming out with two stellar horror films within the span of a few years. What really made this movie stand above most other horror movies was the family dynamic. It was one of the more accurate depictions of mental illness and a family struggling to cope with it that I've seen in a while."
" A Breathtaking Horror Film that isn't without its weaker moments
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,9,"A truly horrifying and well acted little horror flick, Lights Out's somwhat simple premise may stretch itself a bit at times, but it proves to be just unique enough to hold itself together with scares to spare. I am quite dumbfounded at the fact at how scary this film is for being just PG-13. I am not a huge fan of PG-13 horror flicks, and it truly surprised me at how ruthless this film was in comparison to so many other flicks of the same rating, easily being the scariest of the bunch since The Ring back in 2002. The film is made with a somewhat small budget, just under 5 million, and it certainly looks that way if you pay close enough attention- although nothing really feels cheap about it. The visual horror is without a doubt striking whenever you catch it on screen, and due to Sandberg's use of primarily practical effects instead of CGI, it is without a doubt a very impressive collection of frightful moments that I can't help but admire. As for the script, for the most part, the characters do prove to be quite basic, but the premise does luckily shine through. There are certainly moments throughout, notably more so towards the beginning, that seem to stretch the plot as much as possible in order to make a theatrical length. That being said, I wasn't ever bored watching it, there are just clearer moments where the film is more dull than others. Though the characters aren't anything too speical, there are several smart twists throughout, and the actors due truly give the film the most of their ability. In the end, Lights Out is a fun and rather scary horror flick that is certainly a good watch for horror fans- and a rather decent one for film buffs alike.
My Rating: 9.25/10"
" Outstanding!
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,9,"The story is interesting, unpredictable and... terrifying! Incredible feature film debut for mr. Sandberg."
" Lights out, Frights on
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,10,"Incredible concept. Simple and effective but most of all super scary. Easily one of the best horrors I've seen in the past decade.Plenty of scares, really good script, score and direction and all the actors do a fine job especially the lead.
If you're interested in the movies origins you still should be able to find the no budget homemade short film of the same name director David F Sandberg created that got the big producers on board."
" One of My Favorites
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,9,"This film is so well done on every level. It's one of my favorite horror movies. It's scary, well-acted, and a lot of fun to watch. James Wan is a horror genius. His films are smart, effective and contemporary, and this is one of his best."
" Lights on

" Uber Jumpy
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,7,"Yep, this one worked. Just dark and foreboding, and some effective jump scares. My one downer was Rebecca. If Vocal Fry pees you off, she has it in spades. Apart from that, worth a few quid to watch. In the dark."
" The anticipation is exhausting.. loved every bit of it and the jumps were awesome.
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,8,"As an adaptation of a genuinely scary horror short film, it provides a thrilling and suspenseful viewing experience that expands on the story without sacrificing narrative coherence. It has excellent performances, solid production values and lots of scares. Scary concept! Honestly just gotta watch this for yourself. S"
" Teasing & Anticipatory but...
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,5,"... the viewer, having risen to the jump scare challenge, is left unsatisfied with the intensely unoriginal anticlimactic closure - it promises much but leaves you to play on your own."
" Great, Short Horror Movie
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,9,"Without giving spoilers, I was really satisfied with this movie's ending! I was scared from the beginning, screamed out loud several times, and cared about the characters quite a bit. And it was short!"
" Scary movie!
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,9,Very scary movie if you're in the right mood for it. Plays on your base fears of being afraid of the dark.
" It's a perfect haunted house.
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,6,"For a limited budget horror flick, this was pretty good. Somewhat original, plus the acting was pretty decent. Id say it was a pretty scary movie as well. One of the best parts is that it isn't frustrating, almost everything people do is logical."
" Very scary
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,10,"This is avery well_crafted and SCARY movie. In a universe of boring cookie cutter horror movies, this is an inventive and frightening movie with appealling characters and effective special effects. Watch it."
" Lights out
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,6,Story seems interesting. The acting is reasonable.
" Great horror
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,10,What can I say this film was great from start to finish when my mam asked me to put on a good horror I told her about this film and that it was good. Because she was having to stay in bed because of a accident and was in pain I put it on for her I later found out she could not watch it because it was making her jump she said she only watched the first 20 mins and knocked it off I can't wait for lights out 2.
" Lights out
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,8,"It wasn't until I checked the credits that I realized this was based off of the short film by David F. Sandberg. I knew the lights off/lights on shadow figure thing seemed familiar. While I really loved the short film, I don't necessarily agree that it needed the full length treatment. I feel like we see this a lot - capitalize off some popular internet thing that, when extended, loses some of what made it special in the first place. The short film was unsettling and creepy as it was; giving it a back story and more detail made it feel cheapened. I'm not a huge fan of ""BOO!"" gotcha horror movies, though; I come from a generation that was raised on the original Halloween and, for me, that is the apex of subtle, creepy, slow burn etc - everything that makes one get enveloped in a movie. When there are two many jump-atchas, it is jarring and does not make for high replay value (for me, anyway). I thought the mental asylum backstory was so played out; I feel like maybe that trope should be burned alive. We get it. Although that's kind of how I also feel about kids being creepy (or ""troubled""), too. There's just so little variation in horror these days. Not all bad, though - I feel like the choice of Teresa Palmer as Maria Bello (Sophie)'s character's daughter was a fantastic choice. I not only enjoyed her performance but I feel she looks the part; she looks like a younger version of her."
" A simple yet moderately weighty story that's concept demonstrates the continuous creativity the horror genre contributes
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,8,"A simple yet moderately weighty story that's concept demonstrates the continuous creativity the horror genre contributes. The cinematography is nothing special, however David Sandberg's clever use of lighting sprinkles scenes with an allurement that appetizes shots. Despite various jump scares feeling cheap in their execution, several were reasonably creative, adapting the already unique concept into a fresh fright for the viewer. Although the placement of characters such as Sophie was clumsily juggled from scene to scene, most characters were considerately fleshed out and gave valid justifications to serve not just the plot but their own and others story archs. And I appreciated the plots focus wasn't purely of the 'monster' needing to be defeated but on character's quarrels, interactions based on these quarrels and growth learnt from these quarrels which in all expanded the movie beyond a typical horror flick. Bret however, felt substantially shoehorned in at times and although provided support for Rebecca, possibly could of been written out. Acting on all parts wasn't horrible nor was the dialogue thrown from character to character but rarely did this thieve from the experience. Diana, along with her backstory, was interesting yet confusing at times as beyond light being her biggest weakness, her abilities were hardly discussed, therefore giving her an almost limitless use of her powers. As well as this, throughout the movie it felt as though there was a constant need to amplify minuscule happenings and although being a horror, it was overused and fatigued further important moments. The finale was unexpected which granted a more enjoyable ending to what could of been a typical bland horror finish. Overall, both an amazing movie for Sandberg's first flick and an appealing watch for horror fans looking for a unique new concept to immerse themselves in."

" Above average
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,8,Far better than I thought. Added to the short film enough but not so much it was convoluted. Would've been better in theaters. I saw it on HBO but still worth a gander
" David F. Sandberg, wow.
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,6,What a scary film. He plays on our fear of the dark and uses it to spectacular effect. So good.
" Movie which creates it's own rules and break them all.
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,2,"Acording to movie's physics the monster is hurt by light and can only appear in dark, yet many times small light burst doesn't or barely hurt it or even worse she does something in a completely lit area without any consequences."
" Unique concept of horror movie
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,8,Beautifully crafted movie. A very unique and brand new concept of horror movie put into Place. A Must watch for Horror lovers
" Fun movie for a casual night of scares
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,7,"Granted, this movie isn't the best horror movie ever made. However, it's pretty damn cool visually. Uses fun ways to play with lighting and darkness for jump scares and to keep it creepy. If you're looking for a fun monster flick with a ghoul that goes bump in the night this is for you."
" Starts great, but quickly turns into a disappointment
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,5,"The movie starts off nicely. The first few scenes are great, the connection to the light/darkness looks interesting, the main characters are all likable and the acting is good. However, cringy dialog, particularly from the kid, as well as indecision in the film direction and dumb character decisions quickly derail the movie off the tracks.
Ultimately, the movie is unsure of what it wants to be, a monster movie (like 2013 movie Mama) or a movie about depression and grief (like Babadook from 2014), and it ends up failing as both, coming short of both movies which deal with subjects much better.
The ending sends a terrible message, painting suicide as an answer to depression, and other than few jump scares, the movie has nothing relevant to offer and it ends up being forgettable."

" ""It's Getting Worse!""...

In addition, Martin has seen some sort of entity that appears to be interacting with his mother.Enter Martin's sister, Rebecca (Teresa Palmer), who takes her brother to her place until their mother ""gets better"". Unfortunately, the solution isn't that simple. Whatever is going on stretches back many years into / prior to Rebecca's childhood. As things unfold, Rebecca discovers that mom might not be as crazy as she thinks she is.This is a movie about light, darkness, and tragic loss. The supernatural terror builds fairly quickly, culminating in a berserk finale. The story seems a bit rushed and choppy in places, and could have been fleshed out more. The mystery behind the entity is barely touched on, and at times it's as though no one takes it all that seriously.

" headline
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,9,Pretty good film. the concept was well executed and it makes you feel very afraid to have the lights turn off on you.
" You *might* be sleeping with the lights on tonight...
",2019-11-07 00:00:00,7,"If you want to make it in Hollywood's horror industry nowadays, you have to make a scarily good short movie with one terrific idea and a handful of spooky images, and then simply hope that it'll go viral on the internet. If it works, influential producers will undoubtedly offer you a big sum of money to turn the short into a full-feature film and, with a bit of luck, your career is launched. It worked for Andy Muschietti with ""Mama"", and now he's helming the massively popular ""It"" remakes. It even worked for James Wan in 2003 already, with ""Saw"", and he's now so successful that he can act as influential producer to launch the careers of new arrivals, like he did for David F. Sandberg and his splendid ""Lights Out"".I'm honestly happy to state that ""Lights Out"" is - at least in my own personal and humble opinion - the first mainstream horror movie in a very long time that is truly good and genuinely frightening. As cliched as it might sound, ""Lights Out"" is the type of fresh new film that restores hope and faith in in the horror genre for old and narrowly cynical fans like myself. The story is simple but highly effective, the lead characters are sympathetic and identifiable for a change, and the special effects (or even the lack thereof) definitely rank the most unnerving ones of the decade. Yes, it's another tale of an eerie ghost terrorizing a poor family, and admittedly several of the jump-scare moments are foreseeable, but the Diana character is authentically nightmarish and for me it was quite exceptional that I hoped for all these likable lead characters to survive instead of to die a quick & painfully."
" Great performances + characterizations for a horror movie
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,8,"I've been watching a ton of horror movies lately, and I can say that the greatest weakness of horror movies in general are in character development and the choice of actors. But this movie nailed casting exactly right. Teresa Palmer's performance in particular is fantastic and deserves mention. Both she and Maria Bello developed their characters and have given us ""real"" flawed people. (The actor playing the boyfriend also does a nice job.) My one complaint with the film is that the filmmakers were too much in a rush to deliver scares. The story could have been more layered and built more suspense -- rather than going for cheap scares. We see the creature too often. But again this film is notable for the fine performances and should find a permanent place in your horror library -- if just for the characterizations. This film made me a Teresa Palmer fan -- that's for sure. She's like a more talented version of Kristen Stewart. In my opinion, Teresa Palmer has real star quality."
" The horror genre is so tired and laboured right now !
",2019-10-07 00:00:00,3,"I could go on at length about how the horror genre is so genuinely over-saturated with movies that are retreading, retreating, rehashing, and repeating the same tired and cliche-riddled narratives, and that Lights Out delivers nothing new to the landscape, but we all kind of know that already. And still we perpetuate with wasting time watching the same old storytelling, and the same old scares. The Babadook visited this uninspiring sub-genre but delivered in a much more satisfying way. Somehow filmmakers need to find the universal fears of the dark, the unseen, and the unknown, in a different setting, an unusual location, or in a story that shows us an unfamiliar hero, world, or a set of unusual circumstances. Maybe then we'll have something to really rave about. Or maybe this film just says more about the level of movie smarts in people who enjoyed it as filmmakers are always trying to adjust content and theme to the lowest common denominator. There was nothing poor about this film technically, in the performances, the direction or the set design. It was just.......narratively boring. Creature features that rely on a mystical, or other worldly antagonist really need to follow the ""Alien"" strategy. In that masterpiece of horror storytelling suspense was generated through NOT revealing the fullness of the creature. Once that cat is out of the bag (sorry, an Alien pun) it is very difficult to maintain any tension. Especially in a supernatural tale that relies so heavily on audiences being fearful of the ghost / entity / demon / spirit. A good backstory can really add depth to character interactions, to setting, to motivations and decision making, but it must be full, easy to understand, meaningful thematically so that it resonates, and most importantly, impactful. When films don't articulate this, a backstory's inclusion feels forced, manipulated, and contrived. I've seen many short horror films on Shudder, and Alter, and many more with better, more deserving (of feature film treatment) stories than Lights Out. I guess it's a luck thing - I just don't get how something so filmically basic as a short went viral. It wasn't even THAT good. I've seen way more impressive offerings. Anyway, all that aside, Lights Out was competently put together, well shot, well acted, and decently directed. I've no doubt that James Wan's involvement took it to a level it otherwise might not have achieved based on the story alone."

Brilliant movie n unpredictable little gem.

Acters were top notch too n effects were great! I don't want to spoil it but it's a shocker!"
" An actually very very solid horror film
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,8,"I used to think that the metacritic score was the point of reference when it comes to the quality of a certain movie. But it's increasingly obvious it's jsut agendas. Sometimes they get it right, but sometimes they give high scores to films that are just mediocre or flat-out crap while they make promising or even solid films out to me low-quality. If this were a feminist propaganda film, it would've been a 9 or a ten.Regardless, let's not go there.
I came in with low expectations but I've been left pleasantly surprised. This is a good,solid horror film. In many ways it feels like of the great supernatural episodes back in the day when Supernatural used to be good and hadn't jumped the shark. As there aren't a whole lot of good horror movies, I could safely say this could work its way into my top 10, offhand."
" Easily enjoyable with many enticing jump scares!
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,7,"Expected quite a low budget feel to this movie, and was very pleasantly surprised. Kept us engrossed the whole time, was scary throughout with no boring lulls in the script, and an actual intriguing storyline. I'd definitely recommend a watch, it hits home the fear we all used to have (and still have in my case), of the unknown in the dark."
" Good
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,10,"A fun teen horror film with a decent amount of scares and enjoyable actors. Some comical moments even slipped in!

" Title has it right: You don't need the lights on for this one.
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,4,"This is the second review I've written for this movie. Because the first one was a for a movie that I realised too late was actually meant for a different movie: ""The Darkness"".So that's the impact this movie had on me: completely interchangeable with another movie.Like ""Hole in the ground"" it had a good premise for one section but it was stretched a bit thin as a whole movie. A lot of it is eclipsed by its generic drama subplot. It doesn't enrichen the story, it's just filler."
" Goosebumps - not often raised on me
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,7,"A clever, quite scary and we'll acted film. I rate this as in my top 3 scariest films, and I love horror!!!!"
" Best left as a YouTube short
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,5,"I love David Sandjberg and have followed him ever since his Ponysmasher days on YouTube (check out their channel) where you'll find the original premise, a 2 minute short which is excellent!It was always going to be incredibly difficult to make a feature length movie out of this short but he did the best he could, with the material he had, which makes it worth the watch. I'd definitely recommend checking out the original short on his YouTube channel as mentioned above as their's some great horror shorts to found there!"
" A strong 5
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,5,Most horror films rated around a six are either full of jump scares and/or they have an awfully meaningless plot. However this short film keeps me interested in the plot meanwhile keeping me tense. Honestly the best horror I've seen of this type.
" Good one
",2019-07-17 00:00:00,6,I'd have liked an ending in which Sophie could have been saved. But still a better horror movies than many.
" Scary movie lacking good story
",2019-07-10 00:00:00,6,"This movie is not so brilliant neither bad . The concept of the movie is good but it lacks to give a good and complete story .
The movie provides you many jumpscares from starting till the end .Overall, it's a good horror movie but the story of the movie is somehow disappointing ."
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,6,"Good movie. entertaining and creepy. i have no issues with this movie. (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
I did like how we started seeing scary stuff early in the movie instead of most scary movies where nothing ""real"" happens until an hour into the movie."
" Disappointed
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,4,"I felt disappointed with this, especially as it's received some good reviews on here but I guess everyone has different expectations.This is basically a long version of one of those three minute horror stories I saw ages ago. Every time the lights go out, the monster gets a little closer until.... BOOM! Loud music and lazy jump scares.I rolled my eyes when the guy in the opening sequence realises the monster is afraid of the light just before his lights fail for no reason.Predictable, unoriginal and sadly lacking in anything to make it memorable for me."
" Finally a horror film after so long!
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,10,"I am a fan of bottom line horrors like The Grudge, The Ring, etc. I had been following the trend for quite so long that those horror films that leaves you frightened with the thought of sleeping alone or wandering alone in your house in the dark, are long gone. The new horror movies are scary and they givesl you jumpscares for a couple of times throughout the movie and that is good. But an intense horror that is been carried throughtout the film with a climax scene that is the most scary of them all are not to be found now a days. If you are a die hard fan of films like The Grudge and so, you won't find it exactly up that level but you won't have a bad time. And if you are faint of heart then you are gonna be terrified!"
" starts scary, but kind of loses it
",2019-06-04 00:00:00,5,"I was a big fan of the original short on YouTube, and I heard good things about this movie, so I decided to give it a shot. The opening scene was excellent, and about a quarter of the way through I thought this was going to be an excellent movie with well placed drama elements. However, once I reached the halfway point the premise started to become gimmicky, and failed to deliver scares.That being said, the film does have a pretty neat premise that is thoroughly explained through backstory, which is quite rare for a horror film. Usually, horror backstories are under elaborated on, which makes me feel unsatisfied, even if more perplexed. However, this did not make the movie scary, but it did make the movie feel more high quality.I blame the camera work for the reason why the film fell flat. There aren't many creative shots at all, it's pretty bland. There's even one super cheap jumpscare that just annoyed me.
It wasn't a total waste of time, but it wasn't a movie I was especially glad I watched, either."
" A regular horror
",2019-05-31 00:00:00,4,"If you like regular horror movies with sudden jumps., it is a good choice for you to get entertained. It also tries to introduce a new form of relation between spiritual entities and humans. However not very well explained and just like many other regular horror movies is full of flows."
" Lights out
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,9,"Over-reliant on jump scares and thin on character development, Lights Out does make terrific use of all the usual horror clichés to deliver the chills but its lack of both a sturdy plot & interesting set of characters results in a cinematic experience that's often startling but never compelling.Based on the short film of the same name, the story of Lights Out follows a young woman who attempts to find the root of the evil after her brother is terrorised by similar events that tested her sanity back when she was a kid and eventually uncovers a disturbing truth that concerns their own mother."
" Better than you expect!
",2019-05-17 00:00:00,9,"It was amazing. Powerful creature with such a great potential, I am sad because she was killed in the end, maybe in some way she can be still alive to continue the movie. I loved it, it diserves way more than 6.3 rating"
" Was okay
",2019-05-01 00:00:00,4,"Not scary at all. But the undertones made the story worth watching. Wouldn't watch again though, wasn't entertained."
" This is nightmare fuel.
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,8,"This simple but effective horror movie seems to do everything exactly right. It's smart, clever, and very scary, and it doesn't bother with any of the lazy, cynical stuff associated with the horror genre today."
" Ok feeling from the start!
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,7,"Good movie, good acting, right kind of atmosphere. It was a good purchase."
" Certainly was 'lights out' for me
",2019-04-12 00:00:00,3,"Certainly was 'lights out' for meI read the reviews in advance of watching, but I never get a really, truly, honest critical appraisal. This is simply because - let's face it - there are too many people lacking in good taste.High ratings should be strictly be reserved for such classics as Citizen Kane, The Third Man, Ben Hur etc etc etc). How people can give ridiculously high ratings for what amounts to nothing more than 'bubble-gum-head' trash... is beyond me.Ok, I wouldn't say this film was completely trash, but it's along those lines. I suppose (for those easily pleased) it's ok as a shocker if there's nothing better to do or to watch. However, as a cinematic 'work of art' (which, ok ok, it doesn't set itself up as) it's way short of the mark.The film started off quite well with a good idea for a plot. Therefore, I started thinking (well, hoping really) that this was not going to disappoint.It disappointed!Underpinned by mediocre, insubstantial acting, it wasn't long before this film descended into the usual clichéd repetitive boredom. Hands coming out of walls and doors, the entity (""Diana"") appearing randomly etc.How this has managed to attain an average 6.3 rating on IMDB... I fail to understand.In making half-decent shocker/thriller/'horror' movies, there are (in my opinion) certain things that should be avoided, the main one being:Don't give too much (ie. 'less is more').
We don't *need* to see the demon, the creature, the ghost all the time (perhaps not even at all! Its implied presence is what's important... THiS is what's truly scary.Anyway, bottom line is that I feel this film deserved about a 4.5 rating. However, as there are no half-points available, I'll (in my usual policy) err lower and give a 4. In fact, the more I think about it... a 3/10 is more appropriate."
" Jump-scare-tastic!
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,8,"This exceptional, unpretentious chiller wastes no time in putting the wind up the audience. Here are creatures that exist in shadow, but disappear in the light - a terrific concept for jump scares, and is an idea that has been used in various guises over the years (not least in the form of The Weeping Angels in Doctor Who). Wayward goth Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) is taking care of her little step brother Martin (Gabriel Bateman) , whose father has been killed (in an effective opening scene); his mother Sophie (Maria Bello) has seemingly gone mad, talking to a shadowy entity called Diana. Between them, and boyfriend Bret (Alicia Vela-Bailey), they aim to get to the bottom of this shady business.The use of jump-scares has reached epidemic proportions in horror films recently, coupled with a crescendo screeching of soundtrack violins, and is in danger of wringing itself dry through over-use. But here, the whole concept is a series of such scares - you know they're coming but you don't know when; and they are the fabric of the story. And they are very effective.Director David F. Sandberg has based this on his own 2013 short of the same name. I have not seen this, but it has been critically acclaimed. This expanded version doesn't feel padded in any way, the extra time possibly being given over to brief explanations of Diana's original story, and fleshing out of the characters, all of which are extremely well played (and cast). Also, for a film which *might* uncharitably be dismissed as a succession of 'boo!' moments, the tension builds throughout with no real feeling of repetition. There is emotion here, too, without ever becoming syrupy. Deservedly, 'Lights Out' proved to be a commercial and critical success upon its release."
" Creepy and entertaining
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,7,"Entertaining and creepy film, a good watch, u won't be disappointed, it's fasting moving and original horror concept"
" A kinda mediocre horror movie
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,6,"I decently enjoyed this movie because of the premise and the creature attached to the mother. The creature has a cool past that I found interesting. Other things that I really enjoyed was the opening and the first time we see the mom talking to the creature, it was legitimately creepy. Everything else kinda sucked. The acting kinda sucked, the lead was pretty bad in my opinion and was mainly emotionless. The cinematography kinda sucked, and the special effects REALLY were bad. The sequence of events is passable I guess, however it felt really boring. Not much else to say, the short film this was based off of is probably better. 7/10."
" It was Perfectly scary!!!
",2019-03-05 00:00:00,10,Loved this! Watched it with my teenage daughter and I actually enjoyed the storyline! The actors were FANTASTIC!
" Nice and different.

" Do not kill the lights
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,8,"It's been a while to watch a really scary film like this one, Now I can say that this movie is a horror, in this film I did not see the struggle to make people believe the events but I saw the truth of the events that have already happened and this is what we do not see so much in the films, now that is something special and it is worth the time."

" When the ligh out, you better scram.
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,7,"This scary movie's goal of being frightening film worked out, but it wasn't good enough to be a flawless masterpiece, or a haunting film, and that's mostly because filmmakers (especially the directors)trivialize the power of people's notice, or they care less about the specifics, all that matters to them is pulling off the overall story, and whether the graphics look sharp or not, and that upsets horror enthusiasts.
Well-chosen actors and actresses;I believe some actors play major role in movies' commercial success. The sound effects were on point, however, there are lots of abrupt startles which are found in most of the horror films. I think the sequence of the events come off as a predictable one, and the plot line lacked the surprising unforeseen events, because honestly, they weren't impressive. The uniqueness of the film is manifested in the way spiritual horror and physical (kind of gory) conjointly been put together. Altogether this is a legitimate horror movie, as long as you don't get your hopes up you will be satisfied."
" Watch it with the Lights Out
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,7,"A good horror film that is simplistic in its scares and creative in its relationships. I get tired of the same old tropes, and I felt the characters were well written and acted. The ending was powerful and they didn't make you cringe with one last scare...which keeps the focus on the important things. The effects really got to me, while it wasn't the scariest ghost I've ever seen on the screen I couldn't help but loved the way she appeared and disappeared. She wasn't overpowered or too weak, I felt there was enough back and forth with the different characters gaining the upper hand in a believable way. I was kind of surprised a pg13 movie delivered as much high tension as this one did. Kudos to the director, and actors and everyone involved. The idea was surely not original, but This could have been much worse. T
he end result was enjoyable and well finished."
" Creepy imagery, mundane story
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,6,"Lights Out features some very creepy imagery, but those eerie moments are surrounded by a predictable storyline and melodramatic acting. The original short film this movie is based on is less than three minutes long, and it seems they had to cram in a lot of filler and repeat themselves to get this concept up to 81 minutes. Still, this is an entertaining PG-13 horror movie that's good for a few chills."
" Decent but room for improvement
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,7,"First of all the acting is awesome, secondly the story gets a little confusing throughout the middle of the movie, the ending is set up good but could of been improved, some creative kills, the whole flashlight thing going on in the late parts of the film is a good concept and works perfectly. Overall it's a decent horror movie"
" A Good Horror film

" thumbs up
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,7,A nicely crafted horror movie. It is super scary and comes up with a good plot. After watching the movie you will be concerned about the characters of the movie. A horror film with a strong story.

",2018-11-04 00:00:00,7,A great story and well made horror. It's creepy and enjoyable and at less than 90 minutes it's not too long and doesn't drag. It's not a classic horror but it you like the genre You will enjoy it.
" Wow! This one was good and scary!
",2018-10-19 00:00:00,8,I would definitely recommend this movie to others! It was scary! It ends with a big twist.
" Cool idea but it lacks...
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,6,"The concept of the ghost only appearing only when the lights are switched off is really creepy but I really feel they wasted this opportunity. There was so much potential for this film to be better also considering this is from James Wan. Poor acting, Decent scare factor but poorly executed. 6/10"
" Ends well ...

" Meh.
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,5,"This is good for a scary movie at a pre-teen slumber party, but not much else. I will admit that I haven't seen the short that's mentioned, but I'm going to make a point to hint for it now. I will also say that this movie met my expectations/I wasn't expecting a total masterpiece. Most of this movie's issue is the concept. I will give cast and production credit where credit is due: David F. Sanberg and James Wan made the best that they possibly could out of the mud puddle of a plot. If you like far fetched plots on the same tier as Orphan and are not completely fed up by movies overdoing jump scares, you'll probably like this one."
" Bret is best character
",2018-07-22 00:00:00,7,"This movie is your run of the mill jump scare horror film. It has a neat concept that will keep you worried for a few days, but it's nothing groundbreaking. However, the character Bret is by far one of my favorite characters in any movie. He is compassionate, understanding, fearless, and helpful. There isn't a bad bone in that guys body, and he is a role model for men everywhere. Just him alone made this movie worth watching."

" One line and a decent concept
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,6,Lights out has decent scares and a strong concept to drive it. But unfortunately it's second half doesn't quite live up to its first 35 minutes.
" This and Conjuring 2 might make a good double feature.
",2018-05-25 00:00:00,7,Hi. I just saw an interesting horror movie called Lights Out. I can honestly say that the story was surprising and scary in the old fashioned boo sense. James Wan produced it and seems to enjoy haunted house movies...without the house being haunted from the start.
" Good horror
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,8,"Young Martin lives with mum Sophie. Dad was recently brutally murdered, and adult half-sister Rebecca moved out ages ago. Mum (who has struggled with depression since childhood) appears to talk regularly with someone who isn't actually there. But we have seen some sort of creature which dwells only in darkness - put on the light and it is gone.This horror film gives us a new and intriguing monster. Reminiscent of Doctor Who's Weeping Angels, this entity appears to exist only in darkness: flood it with light, and it is gone. Gradually we uncover the backstory between Sophie and childhood friend Diana, and how it impinges on the horror the family is going through.The story is fun, though not wholly convincing (the effect of light is inconsistent: sometimes the entity appears to disappear, sometime it appears to become invisible but it's still there, and sometimes it is visible and the light blisters it. And what exactly happened to Diana to create this entity, and how does the link with Sophie work?). More to the point, I thought the relationships between Sophie (Maria Bello), Martin (Gabriel Bateman), Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) and Rebecca's boyfriend Bret (Alexander DiPersia) were credible, well-written, and very well performed. We were given characters who were real people: we cared, and hoped they could survive their ordeal. It is unusual to find such well-realised characters in a horror film.The film was visually effective, with the lights on/lights off moments being particularly well done. There was an over-reliance on mad-you-jump sound hits - these weren't necessary because the basic set-up was scary enough on its own.I saw the resolution coming slightly ahead of time, but it worked well nevertheless. And I was particularly pleased that the movie didn't have a contrived shock additional ending tacked on at the very end.This is one of the better horror movies of recent years."
" An interesting horror movie
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,7,I can honestly say that the story was surprising and scary in the old fashioned boo sense. James Wan produced it and seems to enjoy haunted house movies...without the house being haunted from the start. So I recommend both this and Conjuring 2. Might make a good double feature.
" Bad acting and stupid plot
",2018-05-15 00:00:00,4,"I didn't expect much from this movie. It seemed to go on forever on turning the light off and on again. 
The plot or the backstory of the entity is just plain stupid and takes a lot from the movie as it just ain't something you can accept is plausible."
" Awful. Will never ever watch the sequel (if it's possible and if there's any)
",2018-05-05 00:00:00,1,"I had watched this in a room dimmed by some people in the afternoon (why would they?) while watching this movie. The acting was bland and horrible. Bad special effects were added to the mess and I almost had a nightmare. What if children younger than ten were here? I will never watch garbage movies. When related to this, never again. I'd steer away from this pile of crap."
" What did I just watch?
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,1,"After seeing the viral horror short, which was pretty effective I thought maybe it carry over to a feature, but not a chance.This was the 2-minute short scare gags running for 90-minutes. Scene after scene with just unbelievable bad writing and unrealistic situations. Every piece of dialogue was overly written exposition to make sure we got jam packed information of background stories so we are supposed to care about them. Typical formula Hollywood writing. Cram in information through dialogue (TELL) rather than SHOWING us.Sometimes you don't need to give us that much exposition. It can inferred in good writing scenes.A prime example of bad writing it the scene where the boy's sisters takes him from his mom in the beginning. The mom doesn't want this to happen but she just stands there helpless and et's her ""daughter"" take her son away. Not even an attempt to resist. Nothing. No mother would ever let that happen. the movie is just filled ridiculous scene after scene like that. The boyfriend brings this up, not at the time or in the car, but AFTER they get home. Right, again, would never happen.Skip it."
" Overall crap
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,5,"Cheap jump scares throughout. There are some genuinely scary moments but it wasn't enough. The acting is decent thankfully, but that couldn't save the film for me. The story in itself while somewhat original was unbelievable and ridiculous. What happened to the horror genre? That's my review in a nutshell. No point in going on for six paragraphs."
" Needed a Light Switch, in Story.
",2018-03-24 00:00:00,5,"Being bloated is never a good thing, however, also being too short while not really delivering the full story, and/or the full story in a compelling way, is also not a good thing. Lights Out lost me with its weak story development, its pacing as well as its short running time.Nobody ever explains the full situation to Bret. Diana's story comes to light in a very dim fashion. Rebecca is busy calling here mother a ""nutjob"", while she knows exactly what she is going through, and what makes it especially worse, is how that was shown literally in the scene before that comment. Sure, perhaps she is in denial, however the film doesn't portray that very well about her. All she seems like is distant, walls up, closed in and impersonal.Also, Martin knew at his age that Diana was the cause of his father's death, yet Rebecca spent all her life, under the impression that her father just ran out on them, when she went through the very same ordeal Martin did. Okay sure, maybe she didn't click for whatever reason, but for her to inform her mother, as if she didn't know either, just raises some concerns.The movie cutting to post Paul's death without some kind of reference or anchor, was jarring. For a short while you find yourself asking, how long has he been dead? It feels like its been a day, but the film gives the impression that it has been much longer, maybe even years, but is it? Can it?Then there's Rebecca still opting to stay in the house, to try and save her mother, when she already knows that Diana cannot harm her, which renders the entire endeavour moot.Lights Out has issues, that aren't necessarily plot holes, but rather more disregarded and dismissed expositions, and at 1 hour 15 minutes, I guess something was always going to suffer.From there, as gorgeous as Teresa Palmer is, and my oh my she is a stunner, her performance in this film was subpar, while everybody else was somewhat forgettable. The horror bit of the film was satisfying enough however, though it felt a bit repeated since it occurred in the same manner throughout the film without evolving. 5.4/10."
" I felt like I'd already seen this movie a hundred times
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,4,"With decent metascores, I figured this movie would be worth a watch. The trailer looked cool, the concept seemed cool, even the movie poster was cool. But I have to say, while I made it through till the end, and was mildly entertained, it was just nothing special.This movie is fairly formulated...and I felt like I had seen it before. I had, but in parts of many other horror movies. From the kid being drug under the bed by his ankles, to the basement door slamming shut and locking the people in the basement, to the cops getting killed because they ignored the pleas of the people who knew about the monster, to the discovered box of files linking the monster to a dead mental institution patient, I just felt like I'd seen this all a hundred times.Marie Bello was good, as always, but the rest of the acting was just OK. The little boy was annoying because he didn't act very well. The effects were good, and the monster was creepy. Other than that I don't have much positive things to say about it.If you are looking for a good movie in this genre, watch The Babadook instead."
" The Dark Really Can Be a Scary Place
",2018-02-13 00:00:00,7,"When we were young, it was normal that we were afraid of things that go bump in the night, or that monsters were hiding under the bed or in the closet and that going to bed at night seemed labourious not to mention frightful. As we get older we adult up and try to overcome our fears and manifestations and expunge all that nonsense. But in reality, the dark isn't the scary things, but the things that come when only it is dark. The slightest house settling noise can send chills down your spine. And if that doesn't make one hide under the covers, how about a freaky, wiry-haired silhouette gazing down at you from a nearby doorway? And once you turn the lights on, it disappears. This aforementioned spook is the terror is the topic from the directing debut of David F. Sandberg 2016 horror film ""Lights Out"". The creepy figure fueling nightmares galore is an evil demonic spirit of Diana who was a longtime friend of a mentally unstable mother named Sophie (Maria Bello) who was killed when a medical experiment went awry and that the exposure to the light took her life away. Thirty years later, Sophie has been in contact with her and seems to materialize when it's dark, but once you turn on the lights, the vanishes. Diana was the only childhood friend of Sophie's and Diana will likely attack if her personal existence feels threatened and will dish out destruction with no mercy or remorse. Although she is a powerful force to be reckoned with, she still has a sensitivity towards light and the only way to avoid her vengeance is to stay out of the shadows.Sophie was once wed to someone who left her several years ago and has two off-springs. She has an adult daughter named Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) who has left her troubled way and has moved into a one bedroom apartment with her boyfriend Bret (Alexander DiPersia) and a preteen son named Martin (Gabriel Bateman) who unfortunately has to face the wrath of his mother's insanity. Everything that Rebecca encountered when she was young, Martin is now facing the the same consequences. When Martin tells Rebecca that Sophie is conversing to a spirit, Rebecca send Martin to move into their place to keep him safe from any possible evil lurking in that house. But then social-services chimes in and disapproves of the idea, so then Rebecca returns back to their home and confront this evil presence that's terrorized her when she was small. Originally based off of Sandberg's short film, the material has successfully been expanded to the 81 minute mark. Though considered short by movie standards, it's actually the contrast that leads to the archaic philosophical statement of ""less means more"" and that saying never comes truer than this movie. It goes straight on with the story and doesn't go back on its delivery and doesn't cut corners in any way possible to expose out all its fear to leave even strong people emotionally scarred. The first scenes are chilling and stays its way throughout and no cliche is padded on, even the flashback of Sophie's childhood memory with Diana has an effective moment where you can feel a bit of sympathy and remorse for both Sophie and Diane. It is also a breath of fresh air to make our leading heroine like Rebecca as a strong, independent character, which happens quite frequently, but Palmer does a serviceable job of indicating what it means to be when dealing with being raised in a broken family. Although a film of this genre and situations has been done to death, ""Lights Out"" is also guarded with a PG-13 banter which means there will be jump-scares a plenty, but the movie is still a cut above the other horror films with its effective use of lighting and the dankness keeps the story alive while you're heart is palpitating while the scenarios succeeds to make things all the more unsettling."
" Waste of Time
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,3,"I will first admit to not liking ghost stories of any kind, so if you do, maybe this is for you. A woman who has spent time in a nut house has recurring visits from a ghost who was a previous tenant of the crazy house. We get a husband, a son and a daughter. The daughter attempts to care for her younger brother, as mom is pretty much out to lunch. A family custody struggle ensues, and, of course some bad things happen to all involved. Lights out is neither scary or entertaining in any way. Do your self a favor and avoid this snooze fest and watch a few episodes of the Twilight Zone instead."
" A movie for idiots
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,3,"Probably the worst big-budget horror movie I've ever seen. It's basically ""Scary Movie"" without the comedy aspect. Imagine that.The characters are simple-minded idiots who make the single stupidest choice in every single dilemma they encounter. The monster has a set of rules, but never follows them.The movie is also riddled with derivative stuff that will make you cringe. It has zero originality and copied everything that came before but in a worst way.I give it 3 stars because the editing is good and the movie was able to screen in the projector at the theater. The rest is a train-wreck if I've ever seen one.This director is now in my list of banned director. People who I will never watch another from again. Take your place alonside Jason Friedberg, Aaron Seltzer and Uwe Poll please."
" I'm not impressed with your performance...
",2018-01-13 00:00:00,5,"I heard such good reviews on this movie but when I watched this I thought, ""Wow. What is this?"" This really reminded me of The Devil's Candy mixed with Insidious mixed with Mama. This was such a disappointment to watch and is as bad as any remake of a horror movie.
I did enjoy the first 2 thirds but on the last third it was terrible. Just watch it for yourself because the last third is straight out of a comic book for X Men."
" Better as a Short Film
",2018-01-08 00:00:00,5,"Loved the short story film and thought it was a cool concept. The movie wasn't great but I was on board until we found out that the ""monster"" was a person with a skin disease that was turned into a ghost after ""light therapy"". What a stretch! Why not just leave it as an open ended scary creature or being.Trying to stretch the short film into a feature length movie definitely created some plot hole!"
" I am still waiting for a sequal of ""The Sixth Sense"" but it looks like it will not happen
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,6,"I enjoy horror movies, a lot, but not these melodramas mixing mental issues and supernatural. They lack the essence of a good horror movie which is to entice the audience in a psychological thriller to a point where you believe that what is going on the big screen could potentially happen when you go back to your house. Especially if you are American and live in one of those nice big houses. Ghosts usually do not pick Latin America houses. That's because they will probably have to haunt a studio place, where the living room is also the bedroom and there is one bathroom which in a standard American house would be a cat or do; g area. Anyway, my point is, this movie is a 5 or 6, it will scare you in a couple of scenes but that's it. As soon as you leave the theater, you will turn on your cell, check some e-mails, FB, and think of what you will see next time. This movie will definitely not stick only that when someone ask, you will probably say: ""Oh yes, I saw it once"". Please make the Sixth Sense sequal."
" Well-made horror fun
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Lights Out' is a semi-conventional haunted house film, with one person being haunted, but the rest of the family able to see the spirit/demon/ghost/whatever, rather than one of those movies where it's only visible to the kid. Good start, with the shadowy apparition offing Paul (Burke), who is Rebecca (Palmer)'s step-dad, Martin (Bateman)'s dad, and Sophie (Bello)'s husband. Turns out the thing can't appear or been seen in the light and lurks in the shadows...The film does a good job of introducing the characters, including Rebecca's boyfriend Brett (DiPersia), but also doesn't let too long go without any scares or tension. The beauty of the evil being in the shadows means that you're always looking behind characters or in the corners of every shot! The backstory of how Diana was Sophie's childhood friend emerges and goes some (but certainly not all) of the way to explaining the haunting.There's a decent body count, scares, tension and shocks throughout, a good score, and it doesn't overstay it's welcome. The ending is good and logical. All the actors, including the kid, are above average. One of the better horror films I've seen in a while - scary, without being too stupid or gory."
" Not bad, but not great
",2017-12-31 00:00:00,6,"The premise had possibilities, but the execution was sub-par. The characters were flat, with no real development or motivation, save the typical horror movie tropes. It wasn't a bad film to watch, but could have been so much better, giving a real reason. To be afraid of the dark."
" A very nice movie!
",2017-12-20 00:00:00,10,Even the intro alone got me really really shocked. One of the best movies ever.
" great visual concept
",2017-12-16 00:00:00,7,Martin is a little boy hounded by a monster in the dark. His dad (Billy Burke) is killed by a woman in the dark. His mother (Maria Bello) seems to be talking to that mysterious being called Diana. Children's Services calls in his step-sister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) who has commitment issues unwilling to even let Bret keep one sock at her place. Rebecca takes Martin to her home upon seeing her mother in dire mental state.The visual concept of a lurker in the dark is quite compelling. The movie could have done more with a slower burn. It does a big kill right at the beginning which leaves the shock of discovery less overwhelming. It becomes the same move over and over again. It's a great move but it would work so much better with a gradual ramp up. The mother's madness is intriguing. A little more thought could be used to maximize the story.
" Should've stayed short
",2017-12-15 00:00:00,5,"There is some good use of jump horrors and the concept of the ghost disappearing in light has been used to create diverse ideas to be used. But basically, the short film was great because it was straight to the point without trying to be anything more. Here they've tried to create a backstory and reasons which really doesn't suit overall and felt like they are overdoing it. It's commendable they tried to include some social issues but with some stupid and corny dialogues all along that wasn't remotely effective."
" Fresh Take On The Haunted House Tale
",2017-12-07 00:00:00,7,"Not bad at all for a film about psychosis which uses the idea of the evil human spirit--as opposed to the demon--as the enemy of people who want to live normal lives. The child actor is brilliant--a real natural. The remaining actors are good, and believable. Nothing fantastic, really, but certainly not your run-of-the-mill ghost story. Big fan of the ghost story here, and this one has that certain something I like."
" Based on the short film of the same name.
",2017-12-01 00:00:00,6,"A malevolent supernatural entity called Diana (Alicia Vela-Bailey), who can only attack when the lights are out, terrorises a young boy, Martin (Gabriel Bateman). With his mentally ill mother (Maria Bello) unable to protect him, it is up to Martin's older sister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) and her boyfriend Bret (Alexander DiPersia) to try and battle the creature.The original 3 minute short of Lights Out was a well-executed and extremely efficient exercise in creepiness, a one-trick terror trip, light on story but heavy on atmosphere and scares. When I heard that creator David F. Sandberg was going to turn it into a full-length feature, I was intrigued: what kind of storyline would he come up with in order to substantiate the spookiness?It didn't come as too much of a surprise to discover that Sandberg's plot for this movie is a little on the flimsy side, and just a tad confusing, but thankfully the film's novelty—a supernatural being that only exists in the shadows—is well handled and still proves very effective, providing enough thrills to make the movie a reasonably satisfying chiller. I might still be in the dark about exactly who or what Diana was, and I could have done with Sandberg shedding more light on her motivation, but I know for sure that I wouldn't like to bump into her in the middle of the night."
" Restored my faith in supernatural themed movies
",2017-12-01 00:00:00,10,Wasn't expecting much to be honest as all supernatural based movies have been rather... Well dull and disappointing this was different this was brilliant. Teresa Palmer really surprised me.... She was fantastic in this. I mean the story was good the jump scares were good it was honestly.. Genuinely the first supernatural themed movie I've enjoyed in a long time can't praise it enough it was fantastic watch it
" Scary without the usual jump scares
",2017-11-28 00:00:00,7,"I watched it last night and it did a good job of making me afraid of the dark for a bit. The movie is very well done where it does not rely so much on the usual jump scares but sets up the creepy environment in such a way where u are already feeling scared when the lights are out. I think it did a decent job of accomplishing what it went after. My complaints were that it was too short, barely an hour and 15 min. They did a good job that they did not stretch it out too think but at the same time they could have invested more time in the script and made it even better and added more to it coz it seemed to end abruptly. I feel the score could have been more scarier.The Verdict: 6.5/10 The Good: Overall a good horror movie, well made, very different than the standard haunted house theme or CGI ghosts. Worth a watch if you are a horror fan The Bad: Very short , slightly weaker story in terms of character development, could have invested a bit more time in building the immersive environment"
" Note: this review might have a some spoilers in it.
",2017-11-02 00:00:00,10,"Lights OutOne of the scariest films I've seen is called Lights Out. This movie was directed by David Sandberg, who is actually a Swedish film director. He is mainly known for his short horror films, but he has gotten most of his recognition from Lights Out. The movie came out in theaters in 2016. There aren't any really big known actors in this movie, but everyone plays their part well. This whole movie will have you on edge, and it escalates pretty quickly. I've seen the movie twice, and it still makes me jump during the scary scenes.Lights Out is about a family that is haunted by a female ghost named ""Diana"", that was once the mother's friend when she was a little girl. She is a tall, skinny, and dark figure who attacks them in the dark because when she was alive she has a skin condition that would not let her be exposed to any light. The ghost haunts the little brother first, then his older sister, who gets involved while trying to help him. Unfortunately, the mother has issues because the ghost tends to get inside of her head and manipulate her into thinking everything is OK, so at first she doesn't see her as a problem. The ghost wants to control the mother, so it takes away both of her husbands to keep her all for herself. The rest of the movie shows how the ghost is trying to take away both of her children as they find out more about who she was, and ways to get rid of her for good.When I first saw the film, I was very excited because it had just came out in theaters. I already knew it was going to be scary, and it kept me on edge, which made it even better. In the theater, there was a lot of people, and they all would scream or jump during the crazy scenes. The way the ghost looked and acted in the movie was so creepy that it made me want to close my eyes but keep them open at the same time to see her next move. Something that stuck out to me was how they had her kill somebody in the beginning of the movie. It didn't actually show her kill the guy in the beginning, but you saw how he looked afterwards. For me, I just think it was wild how they had the movie climax, and scare me that early. The characters played their parts really well. It wasn't one of those movies where there was too much acting from the characters, or too little acting either. I personally didn't want any of the main characters to die because they were all good people. They were all scared, but still stuck together and made an effort to help each other when in danger, which I liked a lot. Unfortunately the mother died. I felt bad about that even though at first, she wasn't really on her children's side, but towards the end, she was. One of the good things about the movie was that the filming was good. On the scenes where the ghost would speed up, the camera stayed still and was clear. It didn't shake or move from her trying to attack the other characters. I think movies that do that are annoying, because then the audience can't really see what is going on. Of course the sounds that came out during the scary scenes were good too. Overall the qualities of the movie were good.The movie kept my family, friends, other people, and me on edge in the theater. It got reactions out of everyone in there. The second time I watched it, I had friends with me that never seen it, and they reacted the same way I did, maybe more scared. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get scared by a movie with a good story line. The whole display and all the climaxed scenes will keep you on the edge of your seats. If you look up the percent on Google of how many people liked the movie it would show 82%. It'll pop up right on your screen on the right, Also if you watch the trailer, I'm sure it would convince you to go see it. My thoughts on the movie before I saw it was that I wouldn't jump as much as I did, but I was wrong. I personally thought it was a good horror movie."
" Don't take Diana home
",2017-10-28 00:00:00,7,"Paul (Billy Burke) has it all. A pretty wife Sophie (Maria Bello) who talks to herself, a great kid Martin (Gabriel Bateman), and a killer ghost Diana (Alicia Vela-Bailey) haunting him when the lights go out. Unfortunately for Paul, it's lights out in the first scene. Diana can't survive in the light. Diana and Sophie have an old relationship...a thrill on Mulberry Hill mental institute. Grown daughter Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) comes to help out and solve the plot.The film is short jump scares with a creepy dark figure, over and over again.Guide: No swearing sex, or nudity. Good one for kids to see right before bed time."
" Good scares, decent acting, dry writing.
",2017-10-20 00:00:00,6,"Let's start with what we all see horror movies for, the horror. Lights out succeeds in this department. Though it fails to build any real atmosphere, its scary scenes are pretty well done as far as jump scares go and the antagonist entity is well handled in the scenes involving it. It's nowhere near the terror induced by films like Insidious or The Conjuring, but for a movie that is only an hour and 20 minutes long, the scares are worth the time.As for the acting, all the actors put on a solid, if not dry, performance. Not much to work with in the script to be fair.Which leads to the writing, the story itself. A pretty generic ""entity"" tale albeit well handled and with a very interesting background. I wish the writers had taken more time to build on the back story, which had me intrigued from the start. As for the characters, they were all pretty basic and one dimensional, no real development. Although, I did sympathize more with these characters then I do with those of most horror films. I felt the ending was very clean and was fitting to the film. Many horror films are perfectly good right up until the last half hour, where they derail. But that was not the case with lights out. It was well handled and more intense than I expected. And though it really has nothing to do with the movie, I was relieved that in this day and age of every movie having to become a franchise, they didn't try to tease a sequel and instead let the story wrap up nicely.Overall, a solid horror film with an interesting premise, some good scares, and a well handled ending. Could have been much more but considering it's relatively short run time, definitely worth watching."
" Doesn't make the dark seem any scarier
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,5,"After a long stretch of misfires, the supernatural horror/thriller genre finally struck gold in the mid 2010s thanks to a few well-received low-budget films. 2016's 'Lights Out' fits this mold, as the $4.5M costing fright-fest spooked up $60M+ in the US and found a pretty big audience worldwide.At its core, 'Lights' explores one of man's oldest fears - the dark, and what may or may not lurk in it. We follow the lives of a young boy named Martin (Gabriel Bateman) and his older sister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) as they try to support their troubled mother, Sophie (Maria Bello), who is mentally ill. But it's the focus on a spirit named ""Diana"" that ratchets up the creep factor, as it attaches itself to Sophie and makes everyone's lives a living hell. While this premise sets up 'Lights' to be at the level of classics like the 'Paranormal Activity' series or 'The Blair Witch Project,' it falls face-first in execution with a bark much worse than its bite.For one, the special effects/CGI look plain bad. ""Diana"" comes off looking like a silhouette of the Predator (like, the Arnold Schwarzenegger one) albeit one that is much smaller and less threatening. Also not helping matters is Rebecca's dimwit boyfriend Bret (Alexander DiPersia), as he seems to dumb down every scene he's in. There are only a few scenes that could be considered traditionally ""scary,"" but even those are ruined by bad acting or poor camera-work. Perhaps the only real highlight in 'Lights' is Bello, as she is believable in her role and comes off as being pretty sympathetic, all things considered. Perhaps if James Wan had been at the helm of this, things would have been a little different (and by ""different"" I mean ""better"").If you're expecting some sort of super scary experience, you'll be disappointed by 'Lights Out.' But if you're just looking for cheap thrills, no harm done."
" It's OK, We're all a little afraid of the dark
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,7,"Its brilliance lies in its simplicity. Lights out doesn't attempt to confuse anyone, nor does it look to introduce a totally original idea. Instead, it boldly and unambiguously taunts the audience with the message, ""you were all afraid of the dark as kids and most of you still are."" Never has a scary movie villain had such an easy foil—light. Literally any kind of light—sun, fluorescent, bright. They each work perfectly well. Shine any sort of light in the direction of this movie's monster and she disappears. Poof. She's gone and everyone is safe. Writing this, I recognize that this doesn't sound even the tiniest bit scary. Yet somehow, as I sat in my well-lit house after watching the movie, I felt afraid. A brief telling of the plot: there's a monster-demon-ghost-girl named Diana that lives only in darkness because light hurts her, and sometimes she kills people. She haunts other people in the movie who try to not be killed by her and also they try to defeat her. That's really all there is to know. Yes, it's a very simple plot, but still an enjoyable one, at least in this instance.Something about the beautiful simplicity of the scare tactics just worked. Nothing confusing, nothing shocking. There weren't even very many classic hanging suspense moments interrupted by loud, jolt scares. These we textbook jump scares. A seemingly safe moment with normal amounts of sound that slowly drifts to silence then POW! A jump scare. You may be thinking, ""this sounds lame. How does this brutally basic approach yields effective scares?"" Great question, my astute and thoughtful reader. I've thought about this question and come up with a few explanations. First, we owe a tremendous credit to the actress who played Diana (Alicia Vela-Baley). Her intimidating posture and sickly contorting and Freddy Kruegerish flailing arms bring to life a terrifying character, whose mere presence on screen is enough to leave viewers unsettled. There's something about crouching, and Vela-Baley is great at it. Seeing a person crouch in a well-lit area is comical. But looking at a crouching figure in the shadows, that will make your skin crawl. The other explanation that I will offer is the visceral nature of the scares. Much of the movie takes place in the dark and the dark is scary. We are evolutionarily predispositioned to fear the dark. It's a survival instinct. Don't argue with me on this. I'm right. Anyway, the dimly-lit, shadowy settings are the perfect playground for visceral and pure jump scares. Director David F. Sandberg hits all the right beats in framing and lurking camera movement to maximize this simple and smart approach. So, that's it. If you can't stand jump scares or scary movies, don't see Lights Out. Honestly, I'm not sure why you're even reading this review if you don't like scary movies. If you do like jump scares and scary movies, watch Lights Out. And maybe buy a couple extra lightbulbs or a nightlight before you do."
" An enjoyable if slightly flawed effort
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,7,"After returning to her childhood home, a young woman with a fear of the dark finds her younger brother being troubled by the release of the same spirit her mother befriended years ago and must find a way to stop the spirit from tormenting her and her family.This here was a rather fun and engaging effort. One of the bright spots involved with this one is the fact that there's a lot of great work done to accomplish the threat of the spirit upon the family. The scenes of the ghost in the store hallway where it appears in the blackness with some rather stellar jump-scares give this a strong start, while the apartment confrontations where it appears to be stalking him during their appointment together or coming at him in the bedroom all conspire to make this somewhat thrilling during those moments. Even better is the later confrontation in the house where they confront the ghost in the basement or the attack outside which sets up the celebrated sequence in the storage room lit with black-light where they manage to stumble upon the real manner of keeping her away from them which gets this setup for the finale brawl in which the police involvement helps out the action nicely. That these play together so well is a huge testament to the effectiveness of how they feed into the fear of darkness as there are constant mentions of keeping the light on, trying to power up flashlights or frantically waving candles in front of them to stay out of danger. This all goes hand in hand with the spirit's look, which is rather freaky and genuinely makes for a dynamic, dark look overall. These here all make for a good time here over the film's few minor flaws. One of the main issues here is the fact that the film's condensed running time doesn't really mean it should've included several extraneous plot lines. This one manages to feature several story lines that don't really need to be there, from the troubled relationship with the mother to the personal background with the spirit herself as a young girl which really manages to make this all seem stretched out far longer than it needs to be. These are simply issues that spark the concept of the film being adapted from its source material into the longer format as they scream as filler made out to be included merely for the use of stretching the film out. There's also no real reason why the spirit targets the family, as the fact that the spirit comes after the friend yet targets the others makes no sense and could've been explored more. Coupled with the overall tameness of the film due to the rating, these here are what hold this one back.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and children-in-danger."
" My Favorite Horror Flick at this Point.
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,10,"It would seem that this film didn't get high ratings on IMDb or Rotten Toms, but I wasn't disappointed watching it. There were jump scares and it was creepy. Isn't that what horror offers as drama? I'm not entirely certain which films are scarier than this one, but if you can suggest some, please let me know. I think that after horror fans see enough horror films, that some of the unnerving effect wears off. I'm not sure how The Conjuring got such high ratings and The Exorcist original only got 8 stars, but perhaps horror fans that expect more could clue the rest of in as to which films are better. Billy Burke looked younger in this film than in the Twilight films. Teresa Palmer carried the film well as the lead. I've seen plenty of horror films that were worse. So if you've seen so many horror films that the fear factor has worn off, I don't know if this film will impress you. But if you love horror like I do, and enjoy many of the modern films of the last 10 years, I'd think you'd like this."
" True horror
",2017-10-04 00:00:00,10,This is the only true 'ghost' horror movie I have seen that has truly scared me there were nicely done jump scares and not too many of them. My only critique is that the kid didn't show much emotion he had just a blank face with a tiny bit of 'scaredness'. But great horror all round best one I have seen in a long time!!
" This, ladies and gentlemen, is a real Horror movie.
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,7,"I would say everything in this movie is good, the plot line, the acting, the idea, it has got all a Horror movie needs. It is one of the very few movies which gave me chills because of the scenes. Directing and editing was so good, and it knew how to get us into the movie !7/10"
" Utter crap....
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,1,"I'm generally not a fan of these supernatural horror films, but I decided to give this one a go, and this film did not add any hope for me in this genre. I'm baffled by the good reviews this is getting. This has to be one of the most lamest horror movies I have ever seen. The acting is very pedestrian, and it's jump scares are just utterly laughable. There is no plot whatsoever, I was just waiting to see the whole film for some action to actually start rolling, but all I got was some lame jump scares every 15 minutes or so. Good thrillers, and even good movies in general, are supposed to follow a certain protocol; beginning is supposed to introduce us to the characters, build up the tension, get them in the setting. Around 25 minutes or so, the action is supposed to start rolling and not end until the final 15 minutes or so of the film. This films follows no structure whatsoever. Anyway, like I said I'm not a fan of the supernatural horror films, not because it's not realistic, but because it's a lazy excuse for horror writing in general."

",2017-09-09 00:00:00,6,"An estranged daughter rescues her little brother from her mother's home, but once they get to her apartment things start going bump in the night ...Solid horror, with good pace and structure, and the characters are damaged so there's room for them to develop. The use of light is intrinsic to the story and, while it's fairly original, it didn't feel all that stylish. For example, in one of the Insidious films there's a scene where the psychic goes into the otherworld holding a lamp aloft in the suffocating darkness and the effect is gorgeous and spooky - but nothing in this compares. The ghost is menacing, but nothing we haven't already seen in vintage J-horror.The screenplay delivers a literal manifestation of mental illness, and a pointed dilemma at the climax, which for me is much more effective than metaphorical horror like The Babadook. Maybe the story would have benefited from more emphasis on the mother's anguish, instead of clunky exposition on a long gone loony bin. And one good line: There is no you without me.The acting is good, especially the terrified close-ups of the lead actress. Several so-so jump scares. Don't remember much about the music.Overall: Effective, no complaints"
" I couldn't quite give it a 7
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,6,"This is a decent one, not a good one. Where it goes downhill is at the climax: there's no reason for the mother to delay her suicide just to confirm to the ghost that she can't exist without her. We're watching the movie so we already know that. Realistically, she would just shut up and pull the trigger. What is the reiteration going to do? It's unnecessary. Then, the movie gives one last suspension with the flickering light in the ambulance. That's stupid and unnecessary because we already know what the deal was, so if the ghost WAS still around, it wouldn't make sense."
" A Journey into the Paranormal
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,5,"""Lights out"" is the story of a young woman, who overthrew with her mother some years ago and now has to save her brother from the ghost that haunts her family in the form of an old friend of her mother who fears the light and only appears in the dark.The production is carried out carefully and you get the standard you can expect from a horror movie with some production value behind it. The movie clearly has its moments and you do feel uneasy when confronted with the happenings but I'm just generally not a huge fan of paranormal horror. In my eyes it would have been even scarier if the plot evolved around a real woman, left in the dark and now so psychically damaged that she holds on to the only friend she ever had for every price. But that's not really the fault of the film, rather personal taste and thus I can't say too much negative about it, apart from some plot details that seem to be rather hard to believe and vague to create a story-line.All in all this is your usual paranormal horror film and what you see is pretty much also what you get. If you are a fan of the genre in general, you'll have your fun with this and even if not you'll have some entertainment. Just don't expect a genre-changer or anything alike."

" damn
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,5,"They should have called this sh-t Cringetopia, cause that's exactly what it is. The acting is horrible, especially that mom, man she dumb as f-, everything is delivered over the top extra edgy and sh-t, i couldn't keep watching man. The daughter character is a walking cliché, there's a7x posters on her walls, she dating a sinister gates lookalike, the green bong in her apartment like ""sh---t, i'm this edgy messy chick man."", the back story for Diana is paper thin, the movie doesn't even let us in on her friendship with the mom and we're all expected to feel empathetic towards it, weak as sh-t angle. The dude is a complete goofball and his existence sh-ts all over the plot, which in itself is already sh-t. At first i thought this might be good, like maybe if it was told from a psychological disorder angle, but instead we get this f-King x-men mutant character with origins that make zero sense, they barely even expand on the father's character, it's like names keep popping up but there's zero emotional connection to them, like who even the f-ck is that, WHO THE F-CK IS DIANA?! was she like a lesbian lover? a coworker? a patient? WHOSE patient? What kind of experimenting were they doing on her cause it kinda sounded like they were just straight up murdering her. There's plot holes everywhere, but you know what? It got me laughing so i'm gonna crank the score up to a 5. If you like getting baked and eating snacks while a sh-t movie plays in the background, this is it, this movie's gonna kick your night up to the next level."
" A year later.
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,1,"Saw this sh**-house movie a year ago. Reviewing because there are far too many good reviews of this cold piece of poo. Also because I'm going to see the new Annabelle flick, despite it being directed by this guy. This movie has been done before... It was called Darkness Falls. But that movie kinda ripped, despite being a pg-13 mainstream flick.Lights Out sucks. People who like it suck. I'm mean. Suck."
" Boring, not scary and treats the audience like idiots
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,3,"I'd heard decent things about this movie and had watched the short it was based on. This movie is quite terrible. The characters are constantly explaining the plot even after flashbacks show exactly what they're talking about. As it sits under 80 minutes in length I think it's painfully obvious they didn't have enough story to make it feature length. Any time there's no action it's just characters talking and it's always exposition.It decently shot but for a movie that's supposed to be about someone that can only get you in the dark it was always pretty well-lit. Rather than use actual darkness to create tension it was 'movie' darkness where everything seemed to be lit by a full moon or something.As for the acting, it's tough to gauge since they're almost exclusively talking about the plot so it's clunky and dull. There's another movie that came out around this called Don't Breathe that creates a lot more suspense using darkness and sound design. Don't bother with this one."
" Scares, thrills, awesome acting & strange red lighting
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,8,"Alright, so I'll admit going into this film I was a skeptical of the idea of a ghost haunting a family. I mean how many times have we seen awesome trailers that turned out to be Major let downs. ""Lights Out"", however, is one of those revolutionary pieces of film that should have inspired other film makers to force the boundaries of conventional horror films. One of the most innovative and outstanding pieces of work in this film is the character, Diana. Formless, and only visible in the dark, Diana is what we as children feared. However, her suffering as a child with a severe skin condition also allows you to have pity for this strange creature. But besides the pity and fear there is something about this character, and this movie as a whole, that will convince you to be afraid of the dark."
" Your typical dumb, clichéd ""horror"" film
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,3,"Let's start with the good things: this film is short. Only 80 minutes. That is good. And that is it.Now on with what doesn't work: does it suffice to say ""everything""? No? OK, let's go into detail. The concept: another film, the umpteenth, where there is a family whose children are haunted by some evil presence that lurks in the dark and disappears when there is light. How many, just HOW many more movies based on this concept are we doomed to watch? HOW many have we already seen? Enough please!Realization of the concept: there is one aspect I just can't stress enough (apply suspension of disbelief here): supernatural phenomena are supposed not to be seen or touched. Evil spirits, ghosts, entities are supposed to be immaterial, invisible. You can ""feel"" them, see the effects or their presence, but you just cannot see THEM. Let alone touch them. Every time a movie features some evil spirit which takes shape and substance, like this one, two things happen: in the first place, they all look the same: some shadowy human figure with long messy hair, long fingers and a zombie face - enough of that, I beg you. In the second place, and that's the most relevant problem, all the tension, the mystery, the eerie feeling, the fear of the unknown instantly disappear, and it all turns into a clumsy and ridiculous puppet show.The story: thin as a sheet of paper, no character development, an unstable and slapdash backstory, and the course of events that unendlessly repeats itself: the three main characters move from a house to another back and forth, and every night lights out, creepy woman drags somebody across the room, lights on, creepy woman disappears, lights out, lights in, lights out, lights in, a lot of screaming, and finally we get to the ending.The ending: I could have placed it among the good things, barely because it exists and finally puts away all the suffering from watching this mess. But it is so utterly dumb and totally unexplained that it just stamps the letters BS on the sealing wax that closes this joke of a movie. Please spare me from mentioning the final dialogue among the three characters, the worthy conclusion of a totally pointless script.The acting: I watched this movie dubbed in Italian, so I can only judge a 50% of it, but apparently the only good acting comes from the very beautiful Teresa Palmer. The kid looks stiff and awkward, the mother is rather good, but somewhat overacted, the boyfriend, oh man... a boiled fish would have been more expressive and dynamic.So, what else to say? I suppose you got it: stay away."
" Suffers from some of the same problems that plague many horror films, but it's creepy and fairly effective in what it does
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,7,"A supernatural entity is terrorising a family and it appears that the mother of the family Sophie (Maria Bello) is the key to giving the entity the strength it requires to continue with its reign of terror. Although they initially dismiss their mother as being crazy, they soon realise that the entity that she is communicating with is very real and very deadly...Lights Out is a fairly effective horror film that utilises good camera work and special effects to provide it with a very creepy vibe. It suffers slightly in its early stages when it seems to rely on cheap jump scares and another problem that it has is that it does take its time in developing its story (despite the fact that it only clocks in with a running time of around 80 minutes or so).Having said that when it does get going and once you've had the necessary exposition to get an inkling of what is going on then it isn't half bad; as I've already said the film is pretty creepy and the narrative has just about enough steam to be able to keep driving things forward (in spite of the familiarity). Aside from being fairly creepy, director David F Sandberg also deserves praise for his 'claustrophobic' style direction - there are lots of shots that are framed in tight spaces and even when the camera is in open spaces it rarely sits still which gives the film plenty of adrenalin which helps to keep it enjoyable.The cast are all good and help to draw us in to their terror; Maria Bello is probably the only recognisable face to many people and despite her giving rather mixed performances in the past she is actually really good here. Palmer and Bateman are both strong natural actors and both give excellent performances.In order to try and give some balance I feel that I have to address some of the negatives with this film; whilst it is a creepy film, some of the scares are cheap jump scares and sadly they are a tad repetitive at times. On a minor note, I was also puzzled by how a 13 year old dead girl somehow morphed into a 6 foot tall undead presence??? I mean I'm all for artistic licence when it comes to the occult/supernatural, but surely when you're dead and if you were to return as a ghost then you'd surely be the same size as when you died so unless Diana was a giant when she died this makes no sense at all????Despite the above, Lights Out is still a very good horror film that manages to be creepy, but never to the point where it feels as though it is trying too hard resulting in it being a detriment to the film. It has its share of flaws here and there, but it has enough selling points to make it worth watching."
" don't waste your time
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,1,"This movie is mostly characters screaming each others name for about 50% of the time. Also with that being said I'm still unclear if the ""boyfriend's"" name is Brett, Brad or Bread. I liken watching this movie to turtle heading on the toilet but no matter how hard you push you get no satisfaction. This dialog is weak and delivered so slowly that the kids who ride the short bus are yelling at the screen to hurry the hell up The movie is at no point scary, only had 1 or 2 supposed jump scares that didn't work. it had a decent premise for a story that didn't go past the brain storming phase. Not a hint of character development in site. This movie isn't even worth renting out of a redbox as 15yr old trying to get in the pants of his 14yr old girlfriend"
" Good solid horror with a very creepy creature.
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,8,"I liked it. It's not very original of course, we've seen it all before like a million times (evil creature haunting a disturbed family) and the explanation of the why and how of this creature is way too elaborate and far-fetched for my taste (the painting of such background-information always takes lots of screen-time with the risk of the tension sagging-in), but this having said, this movie sure makes great and very effective use of the clichés. For one, the acting by the female lead Teresa Palmer and by little Gabriel Bateman is great. The latter deserves special mention, he is not just cute but totally convincing as the terrified yet firm and in-spite-of-himself brave son and little brother. Two: the CGI of the creature is very well done. The concept of seeing only its extremely creepy silhouette in the dark and nothing when the lights are on, but when the lights are turned off again it turns out to have leapt several yards forward gives a hair-raising effect. The final showdown is fast paced and exciting and the solution as to how the creature is destroyed is quite harsh and unexpected. I also liked the ending after all the turmoils of the showdown, at last a horror-movie without the usual ultimate 5 seconds shock-image to proof that the monster is not dead after-all or that there's another one or a whole nest, suggesting that the the horror will continue for ever and ever. Here the survivors are allowed to just cuddle up into each-others arms and heave a well-deserved sigh of relieve. Oh, and watch the closing credits roll by for a change, they're beautiful and very ingeniously designed, totally in style with the movie."
" A good horror movie
",2017-06-21 00:00:00,8,"My wife and I watched this flick without any particular expectation. The plot was relatively simple and straightforward. The acting was good by all the crew - particularly Gabriel Bateman and Maria Bello. The special effects were appropriate without exaggeration, which is good for me. It causes fear without lots of blood or dead bodies and without low blows. Another good point for this kind of movie is that they kept it short, and thus avoided being overly repetitive and boring. If you enjoy horror movies, this one is for you."
" Save Some Time and Money, Watch the Youtube Version.
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,5,"I found myself really bored and not at all frightened throughout the film. Most of the film was spent with 2 characters talking about how bad the antagonist was, only 2 (possibly 3) people died throughout, and the attack sequences on the main characters were very repetitive and (this may be a minor spoiler) I never actually felt afraid that the characters would die (end possible spoiler).Though that may have actually been because none of the characters had enough depth for me to care about them. The main character had some potential for exploration when her mother mentioned ""She only pretends to be strong"" but that development died off soon after. Otherwise our protagonist seems like she's out of place; her apartment throughout the film looks like it's waiting for an emo girl with half a jewelry store on her face to come home and start crying eyeliner onto her pillow while listening to Avenged Sevenfold. Though our pretty blonde narrator does seem to cry eyeliner on occasion (a rather unexpected and slightly amusing touch) she looks like she would better fit in at a (shutters) KE$HA concert.....if those exist (shutters again).From a technical standpoint, I guess the lighting rigs combined with the camera work were clever. It had to be, the antagonist apparently can only attack in the dark.....or maybe not? why does she always wait to be seen before she attacks?.....except for those couple times....but she still has physical form and moves around in the light so that means when protagonist turns on the light RIGHT when she's about to get swiped she should've gotten swiped...whatever, I'd go back and verify but honestly, I don't think I can sit through the endless dialogue about the same thing every scene again. Anyway, I would've given this a 4.5 almost purely because the idea had potential and the rigging was cool. But I give it an extra half star because at least the main character was attractive. Just watch the Youtube version, it's scarier and only takes 5 minutes."
" I did not like this movie
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,2,"I am an avid horror fan but I did not like or enjoy this movie. It is seriously dark, with a strong air of melancholy throughout. The film is just suffering, fear and mental and emotional trauma. I found it extremely frustrating and clichéd at times. I really didn't find anything about the film enjoyable, the characters were not likable and the story was not particularly interesting. There was nothing new or original."
" Has potential and is quite good, but not a classic nor ""re-birth of horror""
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,7,"The current 6,4 is a great score for a horror movie. I went into it thinking it would indeed be ""re- birth of horror genre"" as some of the other reviews say. Well, I wouldn't go quite that far, but it was rather good.This movie relies on the lights off / lights on, now you see it / now you don't trick where a figure appears when you turn off the lights, but disappears when you turn them on. It's an effective trick and actually very simple to do, which makes one wonder how it wasn't invented earlier. You could've done it as soon as they could cut film stock. Maybe they did, but lately it's been quite fashionable in horror movies.We have Diana, a ""person/ghost/entity"" who only exists in darkness, and a family who she disturbs. The mother - who is not quite mentally stable - has a special connection to Diana. The story is rather good, but IMO would've needed a lot of beefing up. I could've seen at least 30 extra minutes of this movie, at 80 min total it's way too short. There's so much good in this movie that it actually makes me quite disappointed that it's so short.Acting is good. Would've liked to see much more of Bello. Theresa Palmer makes a great horror lead. The short cast list and lack of ""bigger scenes"" gives this movie a bit of a small budget feel.I would've liked to see this movie take place somewhere else than LA, which just lacks any style and proper mood IMO. The timber framed ""mansion"" (!) where the mother lives was nice, but the other apartment where the movie takes places was just Melrose Place tacky all the way to colorful walls and Avenged Sevenfold posters. LA just makes me think of big cars, tattoo shops, eternal sunshine, bodybuilders, beaches etc, not really the location for horror like this. I'm sure it was a budget decision.The cinematography was OK at best, although lighting and the Diana character was very well made.As for horror, there are jump scares and it's generally well made. The atmosphere lacks IMO, which comes a lot from the locations etc and shortage of material. There are some very clichéd ""why in the hell do you go to a dark basement"" kind of scenes, but I guess they are a part of this genre.Recommended yes, but not really a classic by any means."

" Hey, Diana, I slept with the lights OFF
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,2,"Bad acting, especially the child actor. Man, that kid really can't act. And then the grown adult main character who acts like a 16 year old angsty teenager. The silly plot. Everything that is good in the movie is already in the trailer. So watching the trailer is enough. Lights on, lights off, and then lights on again and off again. That's about all there is to this movie. If you know the bad supernatural entity whatsoever can easily turn off your power source as it likes, the logical thing to do is to have all kinds of lights (batteries and whatnot) ready at all times. Any normal person would think of that. But no, you keep relying on the house's electricity and act surprised when the main power source is cut off. Sorry, this didn't work for me. The 2 stars are for the trailer, because the trailer was creepier than the whole movie."
" Started off promising, quickly fizzled

" a really good horror movie.
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,8,"i would recommend giving this movie a try,it's scary with very interesting and entertaining story, don't let the low rating on IMDb miss out on this amazing scary movie experience and trust me watch this movie with lights turned off and you will know exactly why this movie is called lights out."
" Intense quality
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,8,"They have managed to do something original with pretty standard horror basics. A demon or monster in a horror movie is, of course, nothing surprising. But I find the way it has been worked out in this movie to be very inventive. The early scares do their work perfectly and leave you feeling greatly uncomfortable. The quality of the movie keeps up the whole play through. Credible acting, effective camera work, a terrifying demon and a backstory that makes to think about. An intense, high quality horror movie. Really 'liked' this one."
" Good but not great
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,7,"Lights Out started out on a strong note. In fact, this was probably the only movie I've watched this year that managed to scare me other than Sinister. Like Sinister however, it failed to maintain the horror factor throughout the entirety of the movie and began to become repetitive and tiresome somewhere around the middle of the film. Unlike Sinister, it ended on a higher note. Lights Out is probably one of the better horror releases this year with strong performances from most of the cast, especially the young Gabriel Bateman. It did seem to rehash horror standards with some of the plot devices and also relied heavily on jump scares- which worked surprisingly well in this case. Unfortunately, although it does make a stab at substance, it tends to come off a little cliché. In summation, Lights Out is a very enjoyable horror movie, but probably not one you're gonna find yourself watching more than once."
" Teresa Palmer's fixation with choosing Kristen Stewart's discards
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,6,"PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE SPOILED!!!--- --- ---Remember Warm Bodies? It was a better version of Twilight and Teresa Palmer's loose rendition of what Bella Swan should really have been like was much appreciated by yours truly. This is a rendition of yet another Kristen Stewart role. This time it's The Messengers -- check out the little brother (again with the little brother and the brave older sister) being protected by the sister from a demonic presence in their home. Not that there's anything wrong with Stewart's role in the Messengers but it's eerie that this is the second time Palmer's following in Stewart's footsteps. In and of itself, Lights out is a spooky, atmospheric vehicle with quite a few jump-out-of-skin scares. I liked how sold the ""boyfriend"" was on Teresa's character. He was stuck to her like glue (yet another Twilight nod... ugh) and very protective of her and her family. Maria Bello was wasted in this role and the little brother was sadly underused. Other than this, the depression angle seemed to be the only way out of the dilemma this story presented but it must have killed any hopes of a sequel for its die-hard fans (thank god). My rating -- a solid 6 with little re-watch potential. Btw, IMDb - I am STILL mad at you for taking away our discussion boards. Not cool and a really bad move."
" Big screen adaptation of a Youtube short
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,6,"LIGHTS OUT is the big screen, mainstream version of a famous Youtube short about a female apparition that only appears in the dark. It's a small scale production that attempts to induce intense fear in the viewer, but as somebody with a long history of horror viewing I must admit that I didn't find it particularly nerve-wracking despite the proliferation of jump scares.The film this one most resembles is DARKNESS FALLS, a movie I really enjoyed despite the negative reviews. LIGHTS OUT benefits from some pretty good performances from the lead actors in their attempts to sell the story to the viewer; Billy Burke and Maria Bello are fine in small roles, but it's Teresa Palmer who handles the brunt of the work. At least the film focuses on the horror content, and that consistency works in its favour, although it's inferior in comparison to something like the excellent IT FOLLOWS. That doesn't prevent it from being worth a watch for genre aficionados, however."
" I liked it. It is spooky and it has Heart
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,7,"This is a somewhat lower budget film. There are no name actors and a few plot holes. The effects are not mind blowing. That said, this film is downright creepy and though the story is somewhat derivative of films like ""The Ring"" it has an original flair. Many of the scares are shock scares, but they are good shock scares. They don't feel cheap because the spook is downright scary. The production is decent quality and the cast did a good job. Sometimes, with a horror movie you cut it a lot of slack if it has heart ..."
" Turn the Lights Out, settle back, grab some popcorn, and be prepared to be terrified of shadows for a while.
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,8,"There are those horror films that only pop up once in a while; the ones that are genuinely scary, have strong characters, have a good plot and premises, and actually leave you with a buzz. Lights Out is definitely one of these films.Lights Out is based off of a short film, made by David Sandberg and released in 2013. It went viral on YouTube, and was quickly given a large amount of publicity worldwide. It rakes in views, and Sandberg decided to do a feature length film on the same premises. The story of both is a shadowy figure that cannot be seen in light, haunting the main character. This is extended in the feature length film to become a source of malevolent terror, ruining the life of the main family we see, and breaking down the links between a family to get it's own way.There are very strong characters in this film, and it was absolutely wonderful to see. Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) plays a character that we see as weak at the start of the film. She ran away when things got hard and doesn't look back, not because it hurts to, but because she does not want to. She refuses to. Over the course of the film, we get the pleasure of seeing her adapt and become stronger and stronger. We see her develop as a character and she becomes relatable. Someone who wants to protect her little brother, and be there for him as danger becomes more apparent in his home. The young actor Gabriel Bateman, who plays Michael, did an absolutely stunning job within Lights Out. Never before have I been so taken back by a child actor, and Bateman comes only second to Asa Butterfield in The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. Bateman's acting was breathtaking. At every moment, my parental instincts flared up as he acted out his character's terror. The use of the camera when creating this was shabby at the start. It was hard to focus properly as the camera twisted and turned in the first few scenes, but this levelled out eventually. The tonal range of the camera in this film is not that bright. It's between light and dark, brightness and shadows. It represents well what the film is about and is a wonderful touch to see on the screen.There wasn't much of a soundtrack in this film, and it played it well. The most sound that was used was the background noise of horror, such as the shadow figure scratching away and the sounds it makes when it stands up. The dramatic beats of tones to make the audience jump when something happened was well administered to the film, and the bold decision to make this a film without a solid soundtrack really paid off. Overall, this was a stunning film that has left me with a slight fear of the shadows around my dark bedroom. Lights Off? I'll be sleeping with the lights on for a few days."
" Some Good Chills, But A Confusing Story
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,6,"Just on the basis of the ""creep factor"" alone, anyone would have to say that ""Lights Out"" was a pretty effective horror movie. At its best, it has the ability to make you jump and to send chills up and down your spine. Since, basically, that's the goal of any horror movie, this has to be rated as a success. Right from the beginning, it's creepy and even scary. With no background at all into what's happening or why it's happening those opening scenes are disorienting and certainly capture your attention and make you want to keep watching. The basic premise - of some sort of monster who appears only in the dark - lends itself to a wonderful atmosphere that's used to very good effect. A lot of this movie is shot in the dark or with very dim light that adds to the tension. I also appreciated the fact that unlike a lot of today's horror movies, there's very little blood or gore in this. It really does depend on the atmosphere - something that we see too little of. Every now and then there's even a little bit of humour thrown in (whether it was intentional or whether it was just something that struck me I'm not sure of, but I did chuckle at Bret's escape from the house.) So there was a lot to like in this - including a pretty decent performance from Maria Bello as the mentally ill and tormented mom Sophie.What didn't work so well for me, though, was the basic story. I just really didn't understand Diana. I understand the backstory - but where did she come from? And how? It seems as if she existed in Sophie's mind - and yet she was able to do a lot of physical things to a lot of people, even sometimes when Sophie wasn't around (such as in those opening scenes, or in Rebecca's apartment.) I can be forgiving of horror movies that have outlandish plots. These are horror movies, after all, and outlandish plots are just a part of the genre. But somehow and in some way you have to be able to suspend your disbelief enough to make the story work. I had trouble doing that with Diana. I just couldn't make her ""work."" I couldn't find a way to make her make sense to me. Sure - maybe I'm thinking too hard about it, but that really took away from the movie for me. I needed something a little more coherent to make this a truly great horror movie.But it does have chills, and it can make you jump a little bit from time to time. Lots of horror movies don't manage to do that. So it does deserve some credit for that. (6/10)"
" Decent movie ruined by seemingly unnoticed plot hole.
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,4,"I was mildly enjoying this title, not a super scary movie but lots of jump scenes, when it was totally ruined by what I thought was a large plot hole that seems to be unnoticed or disregarded. I don't understand how Diana could exist in the black light. Black light is made up of high radiation UV light. Now we know Diana can't exist in sunlight as she never comes out during the day and in the picture she was hiding under an umbrella. Sunlight is made up of visible and UV light! If she couldn't go out in the sun how can she survive in black light???"
" Your run o'the mill scare-jump horror movie.
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,6,"No character development, no involving narrative, no suspense build-up, just a poor excuse for a basic plot with a series of scare jumps done a thousand times before - girl walks towards door, something mysterious lurks behind it, will she open it or will she not? She tries to open it, it's locked, so she turns around to leave and THE CREATURE IS RIGHT BEHIND HER! Shocking, not frightening. What is more shocking is all the reviews here giving this mediocre horror movie a gazillion stars. It's disturbing that this is what the horror film genre has come to with an almost complete disregard for building an engaging story that makes sense and involves the viewer emotionally. Even the music, strings shrieking every time the monster shows up, is the same music found in a hundred other movies. I agree with those who said that a clever visual idea first presented in the Lights Out short has been developed into an insipid mush. I stopped the movie an hour and 5 minutes into it, didn't care what happened any more, and the worst thing that can happen to a movie is when it doesn't get you to care about its characters. 6 out of 10."
" Best boyfriend in horror. Ever.
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,8,"Nice concept, pretty well executed and I swear to f*cking Christ almighty Bret is one of the most levelheaded, supportive and all around nice guys I've ever seen in a horror movie. The complete antithesis of your regular 'dumb sacrificial lamb' boyfriend. Everyone was pretty great, but holy hell I loved him. Bret alone is enough for 8/10"
" It lurks in the dark. It deserves fear; not trust.
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,6,"Producer James Wan wants to scare you witless. Never a dull moment and fair share of scares. Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) is a young woman that is compelled to protect her young step-brother Martin (Gabriel Bateman) from a horrifying apparition that manifest only in the total darkness. This fearsome entity is connected to Martin's mentally ill mother Sophie (Maria Bello). Sophie is protective of the entity she calls Diana (Alicia Vela-Bailey). But what is the actual reason for the dedication? Directed by David F. Sanderg. Also in the cast: Billy Burke, Andi Osho, Maria Russell, Rolando Boyce and Alexander DiPersia."
" How much I needed this and didn't know!
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,10,"Oh boy, how much I needed this and didn't know! I was skeptical about watching this movie, but once I started I fell in love with it. The cast was amazing, the origin story about Diana and how the dots connected, the reason she was doing that and the end was a fantastic way of bringing this amazing movie a dignified ending.In these days, every horror story has already been told, since it's hard and almost impossible create an original script and movie without being compared with others, and that's why I love this movie and it was created in a way I think it's the best way of dealing with told stories. Like I said, originality is almost impossible today, so you must play with the unpredictable card, I mean, used the cliché we all know so well, like the spirit that haunts a family, and change the course a cliché would follow, and in this movie it paid of. Everyone could say, oh another haunted family movie, it's just like the others that came before, but no, the writers and director did an excellent job changing the typical line that every other movie of it's genre follow.I really loved this movie, to me everything made sense, the dots were all connected, with a bit of supernatural in it that justifies how Diana was there. My only wish is that they don't make a sequel for this movie, it did so well as a stand alone, that no one can do justice for a Lights Out 2, I mean, the ending was a good closure, there's no need for a second installment."
" Better than I thought it would be
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,6,"I wasn't quite sure what to make of Lights Out from the previews. These low-budget horror movies can be really hit or miss. It ended up being better than I thought it would be, but it could have gone deeper. It borrowed the janky-legged female shape from The Grudge and The Ring and the main points of the story were presented via exposition rather than having the viewer experience them. The mother's relationship with the children was executed quite well and led to one of the creepier moments of the film. It does have jump scares, but it has the necessary creepiness to make that work well. It was smart to use the dark as the driving force of the movie because we all still have a little of that fear left in us."
" keep your lights on people
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,7,If you were never afraid of the dark you will be after watching this.Because the only way you can stay safe from the demon is to keep your lights on.this would definitely give you a sleepless night or two or a high electric bill for sleeping with your lights on!!!Overall the plot is good and the jumpscares do their job it makes you jumpIt scares you and give you nightmares which is what horror movies are made for.Watch it and see if you can keep your lights off
" Super suspense horror, wow
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,10,"This was one of the most impressive horror films from a debut director that I have ever seen and I will certainly be seeking out some of his short films on the strength of this. It's a simple premise that is pulled off with such brilliance it will be a classic horror that I keep going back to. It's one that I missed at the cinema but I found it just as effective watching it at home. I love horror films but very few truly scare me or even make me jump because the genre is populated with so many clichés I can usually see the scares coming a mile away but this was surprising, terrifying and had such a gut punch of an ending that it's not one that will easily be forgotten."
" Lights out or on, it doesn't really matter
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,6,"After watching the trailer I had pretty high hopes for this movie. But at the end the trailer was just a teaser and you didn't get what you were expecting in return. To me it wasn't as scary as they promised. The story was too weak to be entertaining. Okay it's a new concept but that's not a guarantee for success. The cast is okay though, nothing bad to say about them. They tried but at the end the story just failed. It just doesn't make any sense at all at some points. How can that body burn in the lights if it disappears every time there is light? Also a little bit more explanation about the history should have been welcome. All in all it's okay to watch once but I wouldn't class it as the best horror movie ever like some others on here want to make you believe."
" Don't Waste Your Time
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,1,"I do not understand how this movie is getting 10 stars. I'm sorry butthis is one of the cheesiest horror movies I've ever seen. I couldn'teven watch the whole movie. If there were no other scary horror moviesout there, than maybe but this was just Bad! Now Insidious 1 & 2. TheConjuring 1 & 2. Annabelle... All Very good movies. This.... is Not!!!Don't Waste Your Time. This movie is absolutely horrible. If you'veseen the trailer, you've already seen every ""scary"" scene. This moviespoiled itself by its own trailers?!?! I have to have 10 lines on this review. But the only things I can think of to keep saying is that this movie is very very bad. Just trying to save someone's time and money from renting this. If you do get it, you will remember this review. It's really bad"
" I've seen better
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,5,"What can I say about this one? I can not write a very positive review. I really liked Teresa Palmer's role and the rest of the plays, however I found the story too much confuse. The movie ends and we still don't know quite well who or what is Diana. At the beginning I was enjoying the argument and it gave me great expectations but during the film it gets awful, this forces me to give the movie a bad rate, still, congratulations to Teresa (who remains one of my favorites by the way) and the kid (Gabriel Bateman), it was the first time I had seen him playing and I confess that he really did a great job on his roleRicardo Sacadura"
" Jump scare film ruined by unsympathetic characters
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,1,"Lights Out is a jump scare horror with a good concept and some well executed jump scares that are legitimately scary. Problem is the entire film premise is shown and told in the first 5 minutes. Then it just goes on in the same way.That could have worked out anyway, but the problem is the unsympathetic characters. 2016 apparently was the year of the feminist casting. Like Ouija Board 2, this is also a film with 2 women as headliners.Nothing wrong with that except when you make the younger female cast a shrieking b*tch who speaks with the worst rendition of vocal fry I've ever heard. The tone is set when she kicks her ""boyfriend"" of 8 months out after sex, even if he wants to stay the night. Apparently she does that every night. Throughout the movie she is condescending, rude and arrogant, but hey, You Go Girl! I am a single woman who don't need no man! Or something.The other female lead is a crazy woman who takes psychiatric drugs and is treated for juvenile depression. How common are children with depression, outside mistreatment or abuse? Not very, perhaps the script was co-written by the American pediatric psychiatrists association.2016 will remain in my memory as the year of aggressive, negative feminism in films. The vicious misandrist kind. This movie is a part of that genre.I wish I could write a better review, but I simply will not contribute my time and money to this particular negative Hollywood fad."
" Don't turn the 'Lights Out'!
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,6,"So far there have been several good horror movies for the year 2016. Next up on the list is 'Lights Out' from first time feature film director David F. Sandberg. This is one of those movies that was actually a short film that was then made into a feature film, which is always fun to see the differences. 'Lights Out' conjures up some decent scares and even made me sleep with the light on.The ghost/creature in the film is haunting and should cause you to think twice when you walk down the dark hallway, however, the film just relies on one single genre trope throughout the whole film, which is walking slowly in dark rooms, inspecting the surroundings only to have a hand or something jump out and scare you. It's effective, but gets old fairly fast. Still, for this first time filmmaker, he uses his camera well to notch up the suspense and tension throughout with the use of lighting or lack thereof, and keeping the shots tight and quick.The film centers on a dysfunctional family where a recently widowed mother named Sophie (Maria Bello) is starting to lose her mind again and manifests an evil spirit named Diana, who can only be seen in the dark. Sophie's kids try to talk some sense into her, but nothing seems to work out and things just spiral downwards quickly as the movie goes on. There is a decent backstory to everything, but the best moments of this story are never followed through on. Instead, it's just replaced with more scenes of opening creaky doors in the dark and walking slowly through hallways looking for Diana.I wish the filmmakers explored more of the backstory and had more than just one trick up their sleeve here, because that would have made this horror film one of the best in recent memory. Unfortunately, that's not the case here. Don't get me wrong, there are a bunch of good moments throughout the film, as well as some smart characters, and decent scares that you'll think of later while in the dark, but it never crosses over that horror hump into something memorable.WORTH A LOOK!"
" Out; not only the lights.
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,3,"Lights. Scares. Originality. Enthusiasm. All out. Another tiresome, clichéd and by the numbers horror outing to check the box of the annual horror quota, Lights Out's embarrassingly repetitive premise, breaks no new grounds in the genre, in any aspect whatsoever. The setup, introduction, so called development and conclusion are all awkwardly unoriginal to a clinical degree as the plot has the characters move on autopilot from A-B at the exact time and using the same dull devices the audience foresaw far in advance. The exasperating predictability is not compensated by any effective notion of atmosphere or mise-en-scène, rendering the lack of plot and pedestrian acting all the more evident."
" Not as frightening as I thought it would be. I'm sure some will leave the light on at night after seeing it.
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,5,"""You should let me stay at your place, just for a night. Good luck with that one, buddy.""In the vinyl era (Indeed, I experienced those days as well) you could purchase an extended version of a single. The so-called maxi-single. Sometimes you were surprised by the extended version of the single because not so bad sounding variations were added in an artistic way. However, in most cases it was just a miserable elongated version with unnecessary repetitions and tedious long intros and outros. The final feeling was more like a slight disappointment and a sudden realization that the music industry tricked you again and took away your laboriously saved money in a shrewd way. A maxi-single wasn't a guarantee that a sublime sounding music tune would sound even more impressive. I have the same feeling about ""Lights out"". The short film (this movie is based on) went viral on You Tube and reached a very high level in terms of originality and entertainment. This version is nothing more than a stretched version with the same phenomenon repeating itself over and over again. And that's an entity which is only visible when the lights go out. And believe me, there are a lot of non-functioning lights or incidents in which the lights suddenly stop functioning. An irritating number of times.People don't feel at ease in the dark instinctively. Children and even adults are afraid in the dark sometimes. That's a form of self-protection. Protection against the unknown and against taking any risks. And that uneasy feeling is exploited in ""Lights out"" thoroughly. And the fact that the threat can be eliminated again and again by making use of a light source, is a unique feature that can be used in an interesting way. Sadly enough, the mystery and the origin of the creature is being revealed already early. No surprise anymore and less excitement. The only thing remaining in this typical horror are the acting and the use of jump scares. And fortunately this wasn't so bad. Most horrors fail in this area as well. They try to scare you by showing scary or terrible, gory incidents. ""Lights out"" tries to instill fear by using that what you can't see.You don't need to wait long in this movie before the scary events start. Before you know it, you're witnessing how this scary-looking creature wanders in the darkness and makes its first victim. A warning for heart patients. This first confrontation could result in a heart failure. And believe me, such frightening moments will occur frequently. This thing that dwells in the dark, looks extremely creepy and made me think of the phenomenon that could be admired in ""Mama"". The next victims could be the young boy Martin (Gabriel Bateman), who still lives with his mentally unstable mother Sophie (Maria Bello), and his older sister Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) who apparently faced the same appearance in the past and therefore left home. In some way, there is a connection between the entity and Rebecca. A kind of materialized delusion that exists solely because of the depressive moods and the delusional state of the insane mother. That's why it acts so aggressively towards persons that could disturb that relationship. Well, maybe I'm wrong but I thought this was the explanation of it all.As mentioned earlier, at times it's really exciting and the movie will scare the wits out of you. The story as a whole is a bit of a setback and far-fetched. As I read somewhere on the Internet: ""The script can basically be summed up as The babadook but dumb"". No complains about the acting though. The three main characters deliver a brilliant performance. Unfortunately, despite the original concept, they still used some predictable and weak options (such as a filing cabinet located in the basement with all the answers to hard questions being found). Sadly this feature film lacks the finesse of the short film. So, it isn't really innovative. But it's still entertaining enough.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"
" Lights Out is Great
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,7,"Lights Out is like all of those childhood nightmares you had in the past, thinking that something is in the dark. This movie is a great horror movie, it has this great creeping factor to it. Every minute watching it I had chills going up my back. It has great jump scares at times; I felt like I was jumping out of my skin. The story of the movie is great too, I won't talk much about the story so I won't have any spoilers. In the movie there were some down falls to it. Like how at some parts it was to predictable, but I won't tell what parts so I won't spoil it. Also, the acting wasn't the best. I felt like they weren't selling it very much. Other than that the movie was pretty good. If you ever have a chance to go see the movie I would, it is worth the money."
" A great movie experience; worth your time
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,10,"I rate Lights Out 10/10 because I honestly couldn't find one reason to not completely love it. The characters were phenomenal, the story line caught my attention from the beginning, and I honestly felt it was one of the better horror movies of 2016. Although I have watched other movies with similar plots, this one really drew me in with the choice of main characters, and I was rooting for them the entire time. The ""bad guy"" was honestly creepy and had me jumping out of my skin a couple of times- and I am a lover of horror who doesn't scare easily. So, in conclusion, if you have two hours of your time to spare, head to your nearest Redbox and rent this awesome movie- I'm almost certain you won't regret it!"
" Well, it was what I expected.
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,5,"Lights Out was what I expected, a predictable terror, and with a plot More of the same, well the cast is competent, no actor compromises the Movie, but also has no spectacular acting, but I I particularly liked the performance of Maria Bello, I found it very good On paper, managed to convey the problems of his character, the direction Of the Swedish David F. Sandberg is good for his first film, it seems That he will follow the sequence of terror Annabelle, I hope he does a good job. Lights Out, he did even good times, I Initial scene, was where I took the biggest scare, which were up to few, the Script is problematic, some dialogues are weak, and I did not like the Final scene and neither of the history of the film, more Lights Out is not enough Bad, more was what I expected. Note 5.8"
" Reliably scary - solid horror movie!
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,9,"Excellent casting - Teresa Palmer (channelling Kristen Stewart something fierce) as the female lead, Gabriel Bateman as the boy, and Alexander DePersia as the boyfriend work well as a trio. Maria Bello as the ""unwell"" mother is also solid. The casting is particularly good because Palmer and Bello look like they could be related, which adds another layer of realism to the film.Like all good horror movies, it doesn't take itself too seriously - there's some light relief in there at the right moments.I find horror films much scarier if the characters do what I would do, and in Lights Out, they do exactly that. At the beginning Paul (Billy Burke) gets into trouble. What would I do? Run for the light and some kind of weapon. That's exactly what he does! Yeah, it doesn't help him in the end, but the fact that he acted believably makes the film so much more immersive.In terms of jump scares, the filmmakers use them but don't abuse them. Which is to say, they use sound effectively without relying on it to create the scares."
" By leveraging the best from all its departments, Lights Out delivers a simple yet entertaining horror movie full of thrills
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"There is no doubt the horror movies have improved for the best in recent times at least for the quality of their thrills. Lights Out fall in this category where the premise is of the simplest nature with no complexity whatsoever and also doesn't have a big revelation to look forward to. The strengths and limitations of the antagonist are clearly defined right from the start and hints on how it is going to end were given away miles ahead in the journey. Having all these going against it, Lights Out still delivers a successful horror movie primarily because of its well conceived and executed thrills. Sophie (Maria Bello) is a twice widowed mother of an estranged daughter Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) and Martin (Gabriel Bateman) and lost both her husbands in a violent and mysterious ways. When Martin starts to see a horrific figure Diana in their house frightening him to sleepless nights, he confides in this to his sister who had similar experiences in the past. Rebecca with the help of her prospective boyfriend Bret (Alexander DiPersia) uncovers some disturbing truth and about this supernatural entity and comes up with a plan to destroy it forever.Best part about this movie is its no nonsense approach about not having any characters or subplots that aren't necessary to the central plot, no manipulative baiters for hooking audience for that big revelation in the climax. Its all linear, simple and the money is right on the objective - scare the hell out of its viewers which it succeeds quite well. The supernatural entity screen time is minimal and mostly shadowy owing to script requirement which complements the thrill factor too. It is also apt to commend some good performances by the actors donning the central characters who doesn't go overboard to keep the premise as realistic as possible. Though it doesn't come anywhere close to being a classic of sorts in this genre, a good combination of direction, production values, acting, screenplay and runtime (editing) keeps this movie afloat in an overcrowded genre. By leveraging the best from all its departments, Lights Out delivers a simple yet entertaining horror movie full of thrills."
