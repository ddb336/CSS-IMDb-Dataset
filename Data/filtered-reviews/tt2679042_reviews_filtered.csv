" So disappointed
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,1,"I was looking forward to seeing it but after I seen it I was so disappointed. I gave up after 20 minutes, it's not a patch on the 2007 film"
" Did they even watch parts of the game?
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,2,"The whole movie has nothing to do with the character, apart from the suit & the tattoo...why make a ""hitman"" movie which has nothing to do with the game?"
" Complete garbage
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,1,"On the bright side, the 2007 film with Timothy Oliphant no longer seems as bad.
There's nothing like being kicked in the nuts to make your stubbed toe seem like nothing in comparison."
" Understand the character before you try
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,2,"If you didn't play the game, you could have watched the previous film
Are you that lazy? Or were you aiming for aome kind of wow factor with a beliefe that you would provide a masterpiece that would get fans to change everything they love about the franchis?Ok here is what you got
Bad story
Bad plot
The actor wasn't bad, yet he didnt understand the character
If you want to change the context and character that much why would you name the film after a loved franchise?
Create a new one..."

never the less, i enjoyed the flick

" why this movie exist?
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,1,"Its just bad and nothing doesent look like the games,awful"
" Rupert Friend is not good actor for Hitman
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,5,"I don't know but i think that Friend is not good actor for this kind of action movie. First ""Hitman"" movie was hit on target, same as actor Timothy Olyphant. They said that new Hitman movie will be pronounced in 2021, and I really hope that Timothy Olyphant is new/old actor, it would be pleasure to watch him again as Agent 47."
" Wimpy weird movie that makes the 2007 film look like a masterpiece
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,1,"The lead actor's American accent slips in more than a few places. On top of that, he has a wimpy nasally voice that is completely ridiculous. He has the energy/vibe of a teenager. Why was he cast in this role? I thought Tim Olyphant was a strange casting decision, but this one is far, far worse. Beyond that, the film is just a paint-by-numbers bland action movie."
" Not that bad
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,7,"Hitman: Agent 47 is a pretty decent thriller/action movie. It was probably not as cool as I expected after watching the trailer, but I still enjoyed it.The story of course has wholes, inconsistencies and illogical moments, but if you just want to see some action and let it flow, then you will enjoy it as well. The main characters deliver and my rather small complaint would that neither of them are actual martial artists and as there are a lot of hand-to-hand combat, sometimes it was not as smooth as it was supposed to be, but still very watchable.Recommended for action movie nights."
" Awful : why did they change the lead actor?
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,1,"When Agent 47 released, I watched it right away. I was expecting a great movie. Unfortunately, such a waste of money and time. It didn't have Timothy Olyphant's version of soul! Plot was bad. Acting was ok. Why did they change the lead actor? Timothy O. could have made Agent 47 more watchable! I still watch Hitman a few times a year but this one: only once and no intention to watch it again!"
" Weak, dumb, dull movie...
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,4,"You know this is a bad movie when even the gunshot sounds was ridicilous... bad acting, dumb fight scenes, dull action scenes...
I don't recommend this movie at all...
3.5/10"
" More than expected
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,10,"I did not know about this movie. I just played the game. My friend suggest me to watch this movie. After seeing this, I found that movie can me more attractive than a video game. Thanks Jeff, you suggested me to watch this."
" 2 loosers escape from mental institution and wreck havok on the world
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,1,"If you have seen what i wrote above then yes you know what i am saying there is not story in this mess of a movie is this even a movie what a shame its so bad its funny there is no story or plot here its just like 2 people one guy and girl who escaped from mental hospital and they take out their revenge on the world and kill people for no reasons they look like drug addicts because of the crazy things they do in this movie and go totally berserk they went full crazy this is it, for those who know hitman series well enough will catch my reference to why i said it mental institution this is i am refering to hitman codename 47 2000 the first game in the series in the game story 47 actually escapes from the facitly .and being a educated highly trained guy and assasin as for this movie its get nothing from the games at all its so hilarious its a joke..the first one hitman 2007 of timothy olayphant actually feels like a true hitman film .compared to this this is junk..its by same idiot producers who are now about to ruin theif game series someone better stop these guys so they can no longer make video game movies.the blame should be on those greedy game companies who gives hollywood their copyrights so they can use and ruin the games without caring about source material or fans..what a shameless project this was whole concept of hitman is sent to trash.same thing happened with bloodshot this year no comic no game nothing is safe from hollywood nonsense.the only great hollywood guy is tom cruise because his films actually has quality and surpasses anyone and even himself when it comes to high standards and quality film making the guy is a king legend icon...thats another debate. and when you look at crap like this hitman 47 ..it mockery ,made by buffoons..my rating is 1/10..as for Hanna Ware please leave acting as this movie ruined your career."
" No silent assassin in this movie.
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,3,The 1st movie was better.This was just a terrible travesty. It had nothing to do with the character from the iconic video games.He was emotional and reckless. That reckless leads to him being a clown of a hitman.Hitman fans. Do not watch this.
" Agent 007!
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,2,"Where to begin. This film just like the title, should be named 'Hitman Agent 007'. It's a cross between James bond and the 1st Terminator. If the action scenes were carried out in the game like they was in this film, you wouldn't of got passed the first level. Instead of an in-depth film about how he was made to be Agent 47 and getting in touch with how the personality was created, we get an invisible Terminator destructing and killing everything in his way from the jump. Making me feel like I couldn't of cared less if Agent 47 was shot down and then brutally decapitated anytime in this movie. His skills in silent assassination are about as smooth as grit painted on concrete. I think the guy in the movie got his barcode out of a Kellogg's cereal box. Say no more."
" Agent 47
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,5,"There seems to have been a great opportunity here to do something very Bourne-esque with the premise, but alas, it's just another average Hollywood action movie where everything is very silly, totally unbelievable and lacking depth. Still, if you just want to watch something with some action, then this is as good of a time-killer as anything else, maybe even more so if you're a fan of the video games that it's based on, although I suppose that would depend on just how faithful they've been to the source material. There's been better and there's been worse."
" About the Movie
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,10,I just watched the movie on demand and hope that there will be a squeal to it.
" senseless action / shooting
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,5,"The story is lame and uninteresting.
The action offers a lot of action, but bored me.
I saw both parts, only the second one was OK."
" ""We determine who we are by what we do.""
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,6,"There seems to be a disconnect between the creation of the first super-human elite assassin, and the nearly five decade interval that a clandestine group calling itself the Syndicate International wants to get back in the game to create an army of them. What took them so long? And in the meantime, Dr. Peter Aaron Litvenko (Ciarán Hinds) had already come up with a far advanced and superior Agent 90 in the guise of his daughter Katia van Dees (Hannah Ware), who by the way, and it didn't strike me until just now, doesn't have the same last name as her father Litvenko. All that probably won't matter to action fans who go for this kind of stuff, but it does sort of bring down the credibility of the story. With a few minor twists, it's a passable flick if you put your brain on hold, as the principals perform their roles well enough without actually being likeable characters. It wasn't explained very well how Syndicate agent John Smith (Zachary Quinto) came back from the dead, since these 'super agents' were still flesh and blood people after all, and the punishment and damage they suffered didn't jive with reality. In fact, the entire time I'm watching the movie I'm thinking Agent 47 (Rupert Friend) as more of a robot or android than an actual human being. Which becomes even more than credible when a second Agent looking just like him shows up at the end of the picture. Don't even try to explain that one."

" This is not a hitman movie
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,4,"This is not a bad action movie, but it is not a hitman movie. Its not about a sneaky hitman. And rupert does not get the part right... This is not living up to the first hitman movie that was awesome"
" Awful
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,2,"Even the first Hitman movie was better. What a shame. Hitman is perfect for a suspencefull thriller, so stop it with the loud action movies."
" Not as good as 2007
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,4,"Hitman 2007 was my favourite and Timothy Oliphant has had it nailed. But the hit man in this movie was just a pencil sketch of Timothy.
Plus the storyline was utter nonsense.
A sequel with Olga Kurylenko would've made it 100 times better. That woman is an impeccable piece of work. And what's with the 6th sense of the female lead? Are you kidding ?"

" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,4,"Had some cool scenes and moments of badassery, some decent action. but sucked in a lot of ways and some really dumb stuff. bad special effects and fight scenes (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
the scene near the end where he sees an enemy pick up a gun to point at his girl, he decides that the best course of action is to stand in front of her and get shot. rather then the much quicker and logical task of shooting the bad guy , which he has been shown to be able to do with ridiculous accuracy. for a second I thought maybe he was out of ammo. But immediately after he turns around and shoots the guy. Prototypical OMG moment"
" Stolen story, bad action scenes, disappointing ending
",2019-06-11 00:00:00,2,"Only gave it one star for the actors. Really one of the worst movies, especially the bad action scenes."
" Poor remake of Matrix/Bourne franchise
",2019-06-08 00:00:00,3,"I watched this movie without any prior experience with the game or the earlier films/TV-episodes. So I didn't have any expectations regarding this movie.While watching the movie it struck me that the movie showed a lot of resemblance with scenes used in The Matrix and things I've seen before in the Bourne franchise.
With regard to the Matrix some examples : the fight on the railway track could easily be compared to the subway fight between Neo and Mr. Smith, John Smith could be compared to Mr. Smith (Matrix), during one fight scene John Smith punches a hole in the wall just like Mr Smith did while fighting Morpheus, the US Embassy scene can easily be compared with the hotel lobby scene from Matrix, the front shot Agent 47 and Katia enter the elevator was an exact copy of the shot with the Neo and Trinity entering the elevator and so on, and so on. The similarities were stacking up and it really got me out of the movie while watching it.The storyline was losing credibility and the choreography was lacking originality. Too much deja vu for me."
" Really bad but fun in places
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,4,"Hitman: Agent 47 is a bad video game adaptation. The cg is cheap, the acting is bad, the plot is stupid and filled with plot holes and a surprising amount of the action is poorly filmed. However, it's only 90 minutes, it's fun in places in a so bad it's extremely funny way and Rupert Friend is good as Agent 47."
" Missing an S off the front
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,3,"Two strikes and out for Agent 47. They tried to make it a thing in 2007 with Timothy Olyphant but I honestly cannot remember a thing about it. Eight years later they tried to reboot it and did slightly better, but I'm not holding my breath that Fox will ever make a decent movie out this popular video game series. I quite enjoy the Hitman games and there's a stripped-down purity to the story, so why are the movies so over-plotted and stupid?Perhaps because Skip Woods (the worst writer in Hollywood) has been hired to pen the script for both of them. Why do this? Did Fox really look at his used toilet paper screenplay for Die Hard 5 and say ""yeah, this is a guy we want to continually employ""? It boggles the mind. There has been much debate over whether Skip Woods is actually a real person and not just a name that writers use when they are embarrassed to be associated with a movie. Sadly, he does exist and all of his work really is that bad.Is the plot really even worth reciting? I'll do my best, as I was a little drunk watching this (the only way to remotely enjoy it). Agent 47 is out to kill/protect a girl who's father started ""the program"" and now they want to start it back up again and make better hitmen but she's in hiding so she must be found and...blah...blah...blah. Lots of people shot, dozens of lackeys willing to give up their lives for a soulless organization that clearly doesn't value them. One wonders what the job advert description would read for these unfortunate men.The action scenes are okay, there is some nice photography of European locations, and Rupert Friend embodies role much better than Olyphant-man did in 2007. The support from his leading lady was pretty bad. I hated her character and I don't want to see her in any other movies. The music, by Marco Beltrami, is, as expected, completely forgettable. He's certainly on the lower rungs of Hollywood composers who constantly get work despite more talented people ready and able to do better. Director Aleksander Bach literally has no other work on his resume (Hitman is his only film) but doesn't seem to be much of a fan of the games, where you can off the targets with a zillion different methods. Here, Agent 47 just shoots everyone. There's no stealth whatsoever, despite that being the main suspenseful drive of the game.Not terrible, but not a movie I'll ever be in a rush to watch again."
" OMFG BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!!
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,10,"OH MY GOD, i cant even begin to explain how speculate this god movie was. This was better than John wick, jason bourne, and even the first hitman. Now i know people might hate this movie because it is nothing like the videogame and i can see how people can react that way but thankfully i have never played or even seen any gameplay for any hitman game at all so i guess yay for me. I dont have a favorite scene because the whole movie is insane. Every second was heart pounding and most of the time i yelled WOAH because of the intense action and kills. I hate to say that this is my favorite movie because the terminator 1984 was and will be my favorite movie but i dont really know about that one now. All i can say is wow. Theres no need to talk about the cgi and acting because all of it in the end was phenomenal!!! I beg you to watch this film and you will see what i mean."
" Slick and stylist all gun action thriller
",2019-03-05 00:00:00,9,"Amazing stunts, brilliantly choreographed gun-fights, slamming car chases, all add up to a good 90 mins of pure entertainment, supported by a beautiful leading lady, a disciplined to-the-point hitman and a couple of dastardly villeins. I've seen at least one of previous Hitman movies and this is a major leap forward. Bond movies would be jealous. What they did with a helicopter was insane. It could have had a little more sophistication, perhaps with the soundtrack and better use of world locations, but that would be as far as true criticisms could venture. The other Hitman movies were good, this one is great."

" An Good Improvement on the Spy/Sci Fi Genre
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,"21 August 2015. Hit-man 47 (2015). This movie might be best called a euro-movie hybrid that captures the spy/assassin, sci fi movie genres and creates a contemporary action thriller with an Asian motif. There are some amazing, unusual architectural design background and foreground shots that light up the screen. There are elements of the kick-ass and blow them up of Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003), the amazing female acrobatics of Hanna (2011), along with the combat of titans from Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).Along the way, there are few mental flaws with the logic of the movie with one person getting away from death too easily and another breaking what should have been impregnable windows. As for the martial arts and fighting scenes, it's hard to believe everything on the screen unlike Matt Damon's performance in The Bourne Identity (2002). On the other hand, there is time for a more natural character development along with a focused emotive theme that doesn't resort to flashy stereotypes.First time director Aleksander Bach brings a fresh cinematographic style to the full screen and maintains a bait and fish game until half way through the movie when it turns into a meticulous chase scene with some nice mental considerations for avoiding electronic tracking and use spy strategy in addition the more traditional physical superiority skills.Overall, this movie is an improvement on the state of current movies out there, while it doesn't have any breakthroughs, it is a solid and step up from many of its predecessor's.Second review (7/9/2017). Beginning fight sequence seems too over the top, unlike the more consistently and deliberately styled and choreography of Bunraku (2010). But for a lot of this movie, it becomes a sort of Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) duo fighting theme one against another. Then there's the added component of humanistic identity as depicted in Kurt Russell's character in Soldier (1998). A bit of weak point includes Hannah Ware's character caught so blatantly on a video camera, a little too scripted even though there is a subsequent explanation. Then does Hannah Ware really go for a dip without a top? Couldn't tell, a small missed opportunity to enhance an intimate, informal, voyeuristic moment. But interestingly Zachary Quinto's character, wait for it, wait for it, has a nice surprise later in the movie though earlier it seemed to suck.This action assassin thriller is distinctive in its educational style theme in the first half of the movie similar to but less direct than the sequences found in The Spy Game (2001) with Robert Redford as the teacher and Brad Pitt the student. And there is a pretty obvious resemblance to fighting scenes and some of the same spy strategies as employed in the Bourne Identity (2002) series mostly in the beginning and main bulk of the movie. This movie nicely has a human heart at its core that eventually is displayed in a typical but effective scene as well as the predictable emotional consequences that never really get overly nor sickly sweetly steamy. There is also a nice but delicate balance of a tinge of humor spread throughout the movie. And finally there is also a little bit of director Quentin Tarantino influence by the end of the movie. An enjoyable, action thriller worth the ride."

" Hitman : Agent 47
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,5,"""Hitman"" though was an amazing and unforgettable game the film franchise didn't pulled it off well. Though the first film was an amazing film it did not succeed financially. The next film did not achieved in both aspects.The film had so many good action sequences but the story line was so shallow it looked like that agent 47 all had was his muscle but no strategies. It kinda loses it's story on the way as well.So overall so much funds and technology wasted for another pointless action film."
" Different ideology from the video game, but still great
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,8,"Honestly speaking, it is very true that the movie doesnt exactly follow the trend of the game, but that shouldnt be used as a total benchmark to judge the movie. I for one, found the movie quite interesting and enjoyable. I dont understand all this critics, if the movie was exactly like the game, what would be the point making it if we are already aware of what would happen. I strongly feel that the differences were worth it."
" hitman diverted away from the game
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I really liked this movie because it shows that hitman may have human compassion based on the situation. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Just a simple action flick!
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,7,"Hitman: Agent 47 won't win any awards at the Oscars, but it is still a fun movie that can pass the time! Some of the hate following this movie is irrelevant, some say this movie sucks because of it's product placement for Audi. Like really, that's not even a valid argument. Hitman is still a good movie, not perfect not bad, just good in it's own ways."
" Best action movies all time
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,9,I m friends of action movies and it is hillarious action movie ever every action scene is great and specially when Hitman in lockup. I watch it many time. But I can not understand why this movie have low rating. I wait for next installment of this movie
" Good Action Scenes
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,8,"To be honest I didn't even know this movie was based off of a game. But I enjoyed it. It has good action scenes and to me the ideas for how the characters see things I found innovative and pretty cool. Good cast. Good acting. Caught stuff the second time I watched it which made the story make more sense. Its like any movie translating from a book. There are changes, but unlike video games, books are much more indept with the details. I feel like video game movies get more freedom because it doesn't have as much development."
" Terrible, wooden. . and did I mention terrible
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,3,"This dire , crass and facile reboot indeed makes oliphants 2007 film seem grand by comparison! The model turned actress is about as wooden as you can get and it's no surprise she seems to have disappeared since without trace."
" Not nearly as bad as game fans make out
",2018-05-04 00:00:00,6,"I came to this film by accident, a present from a friend who knew I really enjoyed ""Hitman (with Timothy Olyphant, Dougray Scott, Olga Kurylenko). I was initially disappointed, having hoped it was that original, but having watched it last night I found it worthwhile (while not coming close to the original).
The premise is interesting - once you can get your head round a rival with titanium injected under the skin that makes him bulletproof! It's a step further than Bond, which is sufficiently realistic to make it credible, for the most part - but for people who accept the Marvel universe it's an easy step.
The film follows through on the action precept, but what I found most interesting is the gradual awakening of the heroine to her full potential and the influence she has on her machine-like 'partner', based on the premise that we are what we choose to live by. It is a promise of potential redemption for a great many people who feel trapped into a future they want to escape.
The ending was a little weird, since 47 took a bullet for 90, yet seemed to suffer no ill effects, and then the two of them were confronted by a look-alike Agent 48, ordered up by controller Diana because 47 didn't take out 90 as well as the prime target. Assuming they survived, the pieces are all in place for a very good sequel, as 47 and 90 would presumably never feel safe as long as the other agents are still around and following Diana's orders.
And if they didn't survive, then presumably the other agents will continue operating for Diana (or her boss?) in a world akin to the videogame series (which I have not seen, I confess)."
" Good generic action movie but a bad Hitman movie
",2018-04-27 00:00:00,1,"It all comes down to the fact that Agent 47 doesn't look or act the part. The suit, gloves, his weapons - they're all very authentic, but his looks, voice, and especially his guns blazing style with explosions and insane noise making - it's all wrong. This isn't a silent assassin, it's more like Bruice WIllis in a suit on the set of Die Hard.First thing I noticed about the ""world"" of this movie is how badly men are portrayed - generic ""fat losers playing games"", generic wife beaters, generic all bad things. And they're included for no reason whatsoever. Just your typical ""we threw this unrelated scene in here to remind you men are horrible because we are Hollywood"". The vast, general unoriginality of this movie is shining almost as bright as the visual effects inside the many computer screens showing flashy animations unlike how any software works in real life but like how they often appear in most bad hacker movies.As per Hollywood law there's also a raggedy female sidekick wearing hipster homeless man clothes and untied shoes, waving a gun around (as you know, we need the strong whamen to be featured in every movie despite Agent 47's only minor sidekick being Agent Smith - a man, and even including him would've been a mistake).What killed me is that suddenly Diana makes an appearance and she's a generic demanding asian woman instead of a classy, middle aged british woman. Laughed my ass off. How hard was it to at least do this one simple thing right and hire a british woman to play a british woman? I bet she'll be black in the next movie, and maybe black, transgender and with purple hair in the third one, right? Lame ass virtue signalling Hollywood racial politics b/s.Seeing and hearing Diana, that's when I was finally like ""okay, I'm definitely not watching a Hitman movie"".Also, 47 isn't even the main character. ""The girl"" is. She's worthless until 47 finds her, then suddenly she's a ""cool killing machine"". She's ungrateful and annoying, just the most generic forced female character. So the movie isn't even about 47. The camera's on her way more than him. It's trash show on all ends. Speaking of ends, the ending is just as corny as the rest of it, and far from anything related to the games. Where as in the games Diana and 47 have a connection and care for each other, asian Diana here seems to not because it's more edgy that way according to Hollywood.Did I mention 47 ends up fighting a Terminator? Yes, it's not just Die Hard, ideas are rehashed from Terminator as well.They seem to have taken clues only from the one Hitman game that nobody likes and didn't have much to do with the franchise itself - Absolution.The best way to sum up this movie is calling it a mash-up of tired old action movie ideas with a knock-off Agent 47 thrown in it.I could've enjoyed the action aspects of it at least, if the story was somehow related to the game, or if men weren't portrayed this badly in no relation to the plot or any reason whatsoever. Or if the actor playing Hitman at least sort of looked or sounded like him. I don't understand why you won't just hire the voice actor for Agent 47 - he might be an older gent but he looks and SOUNDS the part - make a movie about 47 in his later years, whatever, I don't know. Bruice Willis is old and still stars in action movies - it can work. Of course even getting the real deal to play 47, you'll need good writing and this didn't have that.For fans of absolutely the most generic action movies of the 80's and 90's, and zero knowledge on the game series - you might enjoy this. For fans of the game series - you'll definitely not enjoy it, it's almost as bad as the previous Hitman movie with Timothy Olyphant, and that's some achievement."
" You missed
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,7,"The film is based on a video game which I never played. The plot, which was basically explained in the first 10 minutes, I found a bit confusing. There is a group of people who want to genetically engineer an army of elite sociopath killers. They run into problems and want the doctor (Ciarán Hinds) who had once created such people back in August or 1967. They are able to identify his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) through world wide facial recognition software. John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is tasked from the agency to find the daughter, now in Berlin. Meanwhile Agent 47, an old school genetically engineered assassin, is tasked with...well what assassins do.It seems, like a video game, the plot is immaterial, we just want to see shoot 'em up action, with impossible scenes, with the bad guys driving Jaguars...or in this case Audi's. Try not to follow the plot, just wait for the action scenes. And yes Mr. Spock has a few surprises too to even the odds.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Better than the games
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,10,"I'm afraid I don't share your opinion on this one, people. With the twists and 47 not being only a silent killing machine who just walks around murdering people, this movie is absolutely fantastic. I know people can hardly let go of what they got used to, just like with Duke Nukem Forever and its previous games. Still, this movie is a masterpiece."
" Dear oh dear where do I start.
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,1,"Pros: I stopped watching after 20 minutes so I didn't waste too much of my life.Cons: 47 not bald Absolutely no silence whatsoever. Explosions, explosions everywhere. Stupidly boring acting from whoever is playing 47.And the main thing that really bugged me from minute one of that awful monologue, they didn't even get the name of the cloning scientist right. It was Dr Ort-Meyer. Not whoever in the blue hell this ""Litvinenko"" chap is.Honestly I would have settled for them using ANY of the Five Fathers to be the ""creator"" or ""monetary backer"" for the cloning program, but no, instead they made it up."
" Better than the first, but not great
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,5,"Hit-man: Agent 47 is a follow-up to the 2007 dud and thankfully an improved production, although still only average overall. The plot features a young woman with special powers who is being pursued by assassins and a sinister organisation with plans to create an army of super soldiers. Rupert Friend takes on the lead role, replacing Timothy Olyphant in the original, and the good news is that he's a far better fit and a better actor to boot. The rest of the film is dominated with action sequences - reminiscent of JOHN WICK at times, with the director of that film handling the choreography, although not on the same level - and lots of meagre CGI effects which look like they were created on the cheap. It's a passable piece of entertainment, and anything with Ciaran Hinds in it has to be worth a look in my mind, but it's also completely forgettable."
" More style than substance
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,3,"Unfortunately, the movie doesn't follow the success of the game. We only get a glimpse of 47' history and background, the character lacks depth and the whole premise stands out of the Hit-man concept. Pacing is not very good, acting is quite poor and so is the script. The plot is not bad but the delivery is flawed. There is a lot of action, fight scenes are naive and there are a lot of errors.Personally, I only wanted to see the movie because of Rupert Friend who gave a solid performance, but I must say it was a complete waste of time."
" Why changing the main actor ?
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,4,"HelloThis is my first review and i have no idea how it will be.Re-watching the movie again,both actually,got me thinking that in the first part,Agent 47 was so bad a** and tough looking guy compared to the new one. That is actually why i gave 10 stars to the first and only 4 to the sequel.Now can someone tell/explain me why they changed the actor of Agent 47 ?Thanks Cheers"
" Cool action flick
",2017-05-26 00:00:00,8,"I know, I know, this movie is rather superficial and simple. More effort has been spent on cool action than on depth of the story. Well, you know what? I do not care! I quite liked this movie. Agent 47 is cool and kicks ass. The bad guys gets plenty of ass whooping. The action is good. There is quite a lot of high tech and gadgets. What is there not to like? The movie starts of with a quite cool sequence introducing Agent 47. I have to say that I got into quite a bit of ""wow"" mode right a way there. The movie continues with plenty of action sequences with just a wee bit of slowdown in between. Actually the first-half, at least, of the movie is pretty much one long chase.Perhaps I should point out that I have not played Hit-man and do not really know what the original story is about. From a lot of the comments I have read it appears That this might be to my advantage when it comes to enjoying the movie.Some people are probably complaining about bad acting since Agent 47 do not really show much in terms of facial expressions or emotions. Well, news for you, he is not supposed to! He is supposed to be a cold emotionless killing machine so stop whining. Personally I found Agent 47 to be an excellent character. the re is on scene in particular that I liked where Agent 47 intentionally allows himself to be caught in a embassy. Once inside he, to no one in the audience surprise starts to tear the place apart. You have to see it to know what I mean.The second part, or perhaps just the last third, of the movie turns into more of a search and destroy for Agent 47 and his new ""partner"". this part is of course as action filled as the first part of the movie. Naturally it all leads to a big show down between the Agent 47 & Co. The and itself did not really deliver any surprises but was satisfying.The one thing in the movie that annoyed me was this subdermal armor stuff. The idea was not a too bad one but they really overplayed it. Come on! Just shoot him in the head or an eye or some other ""sensitive"" part for Christ sake. Bulletproof my arse! I honestly do not understand the low rating this movie has received. 5.7 at IMDb is really a bit harsh. Rotten Tomatoes rating is, not very surprisingly, abysmal. Rotten Tomatoes and their ""critics"" ratings must be the worst of any ratings site. When these dickwads rate down a movie, that's when I start to get interested. First step is to drill down into the real audience ratings which more often that not gives a different picture.Any way I digress. Bottom line is that, for me, this is a simple, straightforward, high octane action movie and I quite enjoyed it."
" I Love This Movie
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,10,"I don't understand why this movie received so many bad reviews. Perhaps the film deviates from the comics and computer game it's supposed to be based on, neither of which I am familiar with.All the actors gave excellent performances. I was especially impressed by Rupert Friend and Hannah Ware.I saw this movie for the first time on TV and then bought the DVD for my collection. It's a great action/adventure/mystery/thriller film. I love how the two main characters progress from beginning to end. They were not what I expected and I was delighted.I really hope there is a sequel to this film (hurry, please!) and that both Rupert Friend and Hannah Ware reprise their roles.Very entertaining and enjoyable film!!"
" why they made this movie ?
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,2,"i like the first one (hitman 2007), and when I heard about this , i was so excited i thought it's the sequel or something like that , but after i watched it , omg !? this one was so so disappointed .it's supposed to be a movie about (hitman) which means crime ,action and blood, etc. but they turn the movie to a (superhero genre) who take many bullets and still walk !! really !! wtf .overall 2/10."
" 47 Ronin
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,6,"First, let's get this out of the way. This is not as good as the video game that spawned it. Rupert Friend almost looks the part but simply doesn't have that Agent 47 quality. It is a little like if you had Jennifer Aniston play Lara Croft. Rupert isn't helped by a plot that suffers from this time it's personal syndrome (see latest Bond films). Everybody is someone's sister, father, cousin, former chiropractor's receptionist. It is a tired idea that has been beaten to death in action films of late.So the acting is subpar, the story is filled with tired tropes and it doesn't do justice to the source material. Thank god it looks so good and the action set pieces that start okay get more spectacular as the movie moves along. If you can get past the someone subpar opening bit that is more Steven Seagal than Terminator the ride improves. That all this movie really is, a forgettable ride among some nice scenery. Sometimes that is enough for a Saturday night on the couch with the wife."
