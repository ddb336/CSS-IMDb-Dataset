" When you can't do right for doing wrong...
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,7,"There is something quite plausible and touching about this rather heart-rending story of ""Tom"" (Michael Fasbender), a WWI war veteran who takes up a position keeping an extremely remote lighthouse off the Australian coast. The solitude is all he thinks he wants until on an occasional visit to the mainland, he meets ""Isabelle"" (Alice Wikander) and she rekindles his ardour, they wed, and both return to his remote job. Their love is deep, and true - but is soon under enormous strain as tragedy strikes twice, in quick succession, leaving them reeling. It's only by chance that they discover a small lifeboat near their island containing a dead man and a (just about) alive baby - one which she immediately takes to. After some soul-searching they decide to adopt it as their own - even faking the birth certificate. Proceed a while and back on the mainland, their plans start to unravel as the identity of their ""daughter"" is questioned, and ultimately the ""birth"" mother ""Hannah"" (Rachel Weisz) and legal process upset their idyllic existence. All three at the top of the bill are on very good form here, their emotional performances are strong and engrossing - without any cloying sentiment. Derek Cianfrance has cleverly combined elements of both masculine and feminine frailty, touching on depression, loneliness, PTSD and the characterisations effectively draw us into their unfolding story. I can't say I cared much for the ending - it all just seemed a little unnecessary, but as piece of dramatic cinema with some beautiful photography and a frequently poignant, sparing, script - this is a good film."
" Decent movie
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,7,"I liked it a lot, but I wanted to like it more. Unfortunately, the exhibition of some very unreal human reactions which I cannot pass over literally made me give a a star less to this moving, heart-whelming and beautiful moody drama-romance."
" Did I fall asleep and miss something?
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,6,"I'm so glad I decided to watch this on catch-up, rather than staying up into the early hours. I was attracted by the synopsis in the tv listing; more refined dramas appeal and I don't worry about a lack of action, as I look for the meaning as represented by music and cinematography as well as plot. The time devoted to the story before and after the plot-changing event is allocated wrongly. Little happens for far too long, and while I understand their relationship up to finding the baby has to be established, nobody is dense enough to need such protraction. When it came to the final ~25 minutes, there seemed to be chunks of story missing - what exactly were the repercussions of the couple's actions? Why did Rachel Weisz'z character say one thing, then do the exact opposite? The jump of 18 years or so happened without us having any idea how the situation was left, and felt tacked on as an afterthought to offer some sort of conclusion. If I were told Derek Cianfrance had skipped a chapter of the book when writing the screenplay I would believe it. It's all very pretty to look at, the acting is of a good standard, but the story is incomplete and unsatisfactory."
" Dull on the island of Dull McDull
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,4,"Acting from Fassbender and Weisz is good but as usual Vikander is just a bit of fluff on a stick for the boys to ogle at; not a great acress compared to the others and she just makes this thing altogether more depressing and pointless than it actually is.It is far too long and overly sentimental with a mawkishly ""woe is me"" scenario and I did try and maintain attention hoping for something interesting but it just leaves me cold and I can do these types of female oriented movies but not this one - I think most of the positive reviewers must be women who obviously empathise much more with the characters or perhaps they have been through the experience of losing a child so are giving it ludicrously high marks without actually reviewing it for the story and acting etc.Cinematography is good but sadly this does not a movie make and the longer this dreary effort dragged on the more I began to do some internet browsing and updating my accounts spreadsheet so that should tell you all you need to know about this one - Unless you are trying to impress a first date and show her your sentimental and empathetic side I would avoid this like the plague."
" Occupies an overlooked place in Disney history
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,7,"In 1984, Disney's first release through their new adult-skewing label (Touchstone Pictures) was Splash, and the opening shot is a closeup of the ocean. In 2016, this film was Touchstone's last, and it ends with an expansive view of the ocean. There's an unintentional metaphor here.In the decades between Splash and Oceans, Disney's market cap ballooned from around $2 billion to over $200 billion. Michael Eisner was named Disney's CEO six months after Splash's release, and his subsequent growth of their movie business via Touchstone led to the birth of similar enterprises like Hollywood Pictures (more movies), Touchstone Television (huge expansion of TV production), Hollywood Records (music beyond soundtracks) and Hyperion Publishing (mainstream books). To put it in Disneyesque terms, Steamboat Willie was beginning to chart a new course, and the financial peril the company faced in the '70s and early '80s was finally hitting the rear-view mirror.All these new off-brand units became so successful that Disney supercharged this strategy, ultimately going outside the company and buying Miramax & Dimension Films (yet more movies), ABC, ESPN, A&E, Lifetime, History, Freeform (a formidable chunk of the TV business that became Disney's biggest profit center) and Infoseek (a fruitless yet deeply prescient search engine). In a poignantly bizarre twist, they even ended up briefly owning the Kansas City Star, the newspaper Walt used to slog through the snow to deliver as a kid.The company that had spent over half a century building from within realized it was just as shrewd at unlocking hidden value in acquired assets as it was finding the zillionth way to leverage a certain mouse. How many of Walt's peers back in the day would have ever guessed his company would close out the 20th century as one of the largest sports broadcasters in the world? There have been years where ESPN was about half of Disney's entire profit, a tectonic shift from Walt's day. Eisner effectively re-founded the company.In 2005, he passed the baton to Bob Iger, who carried on with the Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and (almost) Twitter acquisitions. And, shortly after Touchstone began to sputter out of existence, Disney forged ahead with their biggest deal of all and bought 21st Century Fox, bringing Hulu, FX, National Geographic, 20th Century Studios, Searchlight Pictures, 20th Television, Hotstar and more into their fold. They now ride herd over far and away the largest film and TV library ever assembled under one ownership umbrella, a very far cry from where Disney was when Splash was released. Much distance was traversed by the time the sun quietly set on Touchstone 32 years later with this movie.When I saw Oceans, the projector broke before the movie began, and they moved us to the only available theater. As a result, I ended up watching Touchstone's final release in an almost comically oversized, practically empty theater better suited to a tentpole than the final gasp of a near-moribund brand. Seeing the label's lightning bolt logo flash across the absurdly gigantic screen is something I won't soon forget, stupid as saying goodbye to a corporate imprint might sound. Without Touchstone's initial success, though, there's a reasonable chance history would be flipped and Disney would be a small subsidiary of something else instead of the one absorbing everything.Touchstone was Disney's first overtly intentional move into storytelling that doesn't revolve exclusively around entertaining the collective family unit, something they'd not really ventured into until over 60 years had passed since the company's founding in 1923. The label's position in Disney's modern history remains chronically forgotten, despite its integral role in igniting an extraordinary level of growth never seen before in a business built entirely on entertainment. How many publicly traded corporations worth a third of a trillion dollars, a Dow component no less, sell things no one technically needs? It's an historical anomaly.It's easy to joke about Disney's various idiosyncrasies. Like how they have to keep finding new ways to convince people to spend thousands to subject themselves to a proverbial people trap set by a mouse in the middle of a Florida swamp. And yet, doesn't that sound harder than making the case to consumers that they need to buy food? Or vital medical service? Prescriptions? Or phone service? How about internet? The list goes on of all the large cap businesses that never have to question whether their customers actually need their products.Disney, for nearly a century, has always had to confront a basic truth: that the movies, TV shows, music, theme parks, merchandise, etc. they sell are not technically needed by anyone. Yet they're the only business in the world to find ways to supercharge non-essential products to such scale that their enterprise value is comparable to some of the largest tech, banking, utility, chemical, etc. companies in the world. All of whom-no matter how complex or cutthroat their businesses may be-sell things people actually need, a luxury utterly foreign to the mouse house's business model.Disney figured out how to build a brand overflowing with non-staple goods that has risen to a place in many consumers' minds that verges on quasi-essential. And then figured it all out again under brands that would give them the flexibility to sell non-family-centric entertainment. Ultimately mastering it to the point of becoming just as valuable as many businesses that sell all those things people (often literally) can't live without.To me, Splash's opening shot-a sparkling close-up of ocean water-represents a small-yet-storied company dipping their toes into new territory, knowing they'll eventually have to swim in it to survive in a wider tide of cultural change. 32 years later, the massive, all-embracing seascape that closes Oceans perfectly mirrors where Disney ended up: thriving in much bigger, choppier waters and transforming into the largest entertainment company in the world. There's plenty to dislike about corporate behemoths, but my baseline fascination with Disney has always been the sheer scale they've achieved through only selling things no one actually needs. It's singularly remarkable, for better or worse. To go back to Disneyesque terms, they found a way to make a little mouse roar.Despite the obviousness of a movie with Oceans in its title closing with a sweeping vision of the sea, it was a little poignant watching Touchstone end essentially as it began, despite all the water (apologies) under the bridge. There's virtually zero chance this was planned, but it's a weird little coincidence that Touchstone's 32 year, 250+ movie run-and the meteoric growth Disney experienced in-between-is literally book-ended by both the intimacy and vastness of the ocean. A perfect emblem of the voyage they took from venerable relic to cultural colossus, and a quiet reminder of the elemental building block of life that came before and will remain after corporate successes and failures are long forgotten.I recognize this is arguably one of the dorkiest reviews ever written, so thanks if you made it all the way through."
" A tale as old as time
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,4,"A mentally unstable woman manipulates her husband into committing a crime on a remote island to obtain a child. When it is eventually found out, she abandons her husband to the police, lies about the story to allow him to incriminate himself, then awaits his death for it. She finally tells the truth in a moment of sacrificing her potential happiness.Jump to the end and find out she was obsessed and infatuated until her death.It is shot well, great locations, and good acting."
" Worth watching!
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,9,This film had such beautiful cinematography. It was a slower drama but filled with brilliant acting. Worth watching.
" Beautiful film
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,10,I think this is an absolutely beautiful and well made film. The acting is so real and it's just raw at some moments. They deserved more recognition for this honestly
" Abit slow but great acting.
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed it although it was abit slow. They totally succeeded to deliver every emotion. I could feel the pain of loss of thier children the hope she found when she found the little baby. I could understand how hard to live with such a lie with tom's character you can't live with a lie and here they built their life on it, When hanna was ready to let go for the sake of her child. And so much more emotions throughout the movie. I just hoped that things could get faster for a much better more rich ending."
" Superficial
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,4,Impossible premise . Seems there is a total lack of screen writing ability to have to go to this somewaht absurd and silly premise.
" What can I say. It's boring, just boring
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,2,"Let's not beat around the bush. Nothing works here. Terrible sound, especially the slurred dialogues, too many sunsets, slow moving and very blant acting. Every single actor walks and talks like they are bored to death. It's one of these strangely overhyped touchy feely movies that actually manages to keep you untouched and indifferent to the story. Not worth your time let alone money."
" Tugging at the heartstrings
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,8,"Tom Sherborne (Michael Fassbender), fresh from the traumatic experiences of WW1, takes up an assignment as a temporary lighthouse keeper off the coast of Western Australia, replacing his predecessor who suffered from cabin fever. Tom prefers extreme solitude to recover from his war trauma, but cannot help falling in love with Isabel (Alicia Vikander) who lives in the mainland, resulting in marriage soon. Isabel and Tom begin their family life at the lighthouse and it's not too long before they expect their child. Unfortunately Isabel undergoes a miscarriage and breaks down. A second attempt to conceive meets with similar consequences and just when despair overcomes Isabel, as if by providence a boat washes ashore on day, with a dead man and an angelic baby girl. Tom is certain that his duties require him to report the event to the authorities, but Isabel convinces him instead to grant the man a decent burial in the island and keep the baby who is named Lucy. Reluctantly Tom agrees and soon their life is filled with love, happiness and sunshine as Lucy takes centre stage. But fate has other plans for them as Tom soon chances across Hannah (Rachel Weisz), the grieving widow of the dead man on the boat, Lucy's biological mother. Torn between his conscience and the love for his fragile family, he takes the extreme step of leaving cryptic clues for Hannah that eventually help the police track them down, arrest Tom for the alleged murder of Hannah's husband and take away young Lucy.The Light Between Oceans charts a series of events hereafter that are heartbreaking as the young and emotional Lucy grapples between her biological mother and Isabel, who affectionately looked after her for over four years and Tom is consigned to be behind bars as Isabel is unable to forgive him for his actions. It tugs at the heartstrings when a grown up Grace-Lucy turns up at Tom's doorstep years later, redeeming the series of events that changed the lives of many people a couple of decades ago. Michael Fassbender's mellow, warm and controlled performance is delightful, whilst Alicia Vikander is effervescent, volatile and emotional. The Light...... leaves one thinking if Tom's conscientious actions were rational, and how life may have been if he allowed status quo to prevail."
" It'll make your heart break
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,8,"This is a heartbreaking story that blurs the line between right & wrong. The performances are magnificent, the scenery sublime, but be warned - you'll need your tissues for this one!"
" Awesome
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,9,One of the best Hollywood movie... DNT miss it
" Exhausting.
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,6,"133 minutes of an exhausting story, told in long dragged out scenes, with ocean-snail pacing. This film needed to be sped up 2x and/or 30-40 mins cut/edited out. What's even more sad, is that Fassbender and Vikander's chemistry just wasn't there in this film - when in fact they have a real life relationship together. Can you say ""awkward"" lol? Interesting story concept with great landscapes and cinematography. But that's pretty much it. The two lead stars couldn't save this film with it's terrible screenplay and directing."
" A Heart-Breaking Story with No Villain Somehow Still Lacks the Emotional Connection
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,5,"The Light Between Oceans is a love story between Tom and Isabel and has a magnificent idea inside it: ""Who is your real parent?"" The way I found this film is really funny. I was checking Desplat for his scores and somehow found this movie. The actings are superb both from Vikander and Fassbender. The story is sloppy, sometimes dragging a bit and silly. The silliness comes from the way the story is told. The perspectives and most importantly the timelines are really bad. The time spent on each year is distributed inefficently and I think this is why it lacks at emotion. We don't see Tom's past(really important to the story in many ways) we don't really spend time in aftermath of the main event and it really drags in the middle. I checked the time in the middle of the movie and thought that this movie really was a slow-burn. You might think that it is a good thing but no, the ending is so sloppy and rushed compared to its start. The tempo is all over the place. The idea of parenting in a lighthouse and the parent stuff are both great but when they are combined it becomes ridiculous and starts to lose its reality and it becomes really silly when the movie takes these parts too seriously(the acting saves it at least). Desplat's score is not prominent but still great. The story is good on its own but in the details it is all over the place. Would I recommend you seeing it? It depends. If you think, acting and its core idea is enough to watch a film, then you can watch it. As I said the main idea and the acting are superb."
" Great movie with strong acting
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,10,"Spoiler warnings:I really enjoyed this movie & have since watched it five times. I've always enjoyed films made during the early 1900/post WW1 & this is a very good movie that doesn't disappoint.
Both Michael Fassbender & Alicia Vikander were very strong in their acting, but you can also see a great chemistry between them, which obviously helps strengthen their acting and the film.
Since watching & googling them both, I now know they are since married, obviously found great chemistry & it definitely shows in the movie.
Beautiful scenery, strong acting, gut wrenching miscarriages and still births only add the the very sad circumstances & shows just how much heartache, depression and devastion miscarriages & stillbirths cause. Unusual & difficult circumstances forces this couple to claim a infant baby that they found through unusual circumstances as their own, a baby who they rescued that doesn't belong to them, which again reiterates that desperate grieving parents would do unthinkable out of normal character things when grieving the loss of their own babies.
The movie shows the dilemma Fassbender went through whilst riddled with guilt over keeping this baby that didn't belong to them, yet wanting to help his grief stricken wife who he is so in love with, overcome her grief over another miscarriage by allowing her to keep this baby. The things we can do when we love someone.
They both loved, cherished & adored this baby girl who they raised. Yet his guilt & wanting the rightful mother to know her child was loved & safe made him leave notes & hints to let her know the baby was loved & cherished. Obviously it backfired because the police found out & traced it back to them.
The hardest part of this movie is when the true mother of the baby finally gets the baby back, who by now is about 3 or 4??
The child is suffering from missing the only parents she knew (Vikander & Fassbender) & the difficulties the child & real mother faced while trying to reinstate the child back into her true family.
Great scenery, great acting with a good script. Not a fast paced movie, but well worth watching.
I score this a 10/10 for so many reasons."
" Beautiful
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,9,Beautifully shot & acted. A real tear jerker. Highly recommended.
" Really good but melodramatic drama
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,7,The Light Between Oceans is a really good but melodramatic drama. The opening feels a little rushed but it's technically well made and beautifully filmed. Michael Fassbinder and Alicia Vikander both give great performances and have excellent chemistry. Rachel Weisz is really good. Derek Cianfrance's direction is really good as well as the music by Alexandre Desplat.
" Tries too hard, just isn't as elegant as it wants to be
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,4,"And ends up being a drag. Fassbender does well enough with the material given to him, so does Weisz, but the casting of Vikander is a big let down. Most critics have a lolita complex-a fetish for 14 year old girls, and that is why she is a favorite of theirs. It always comes off as a kid out of her depth , taking herself too seriously pretending to ""act"". Perhaps many women relate to that as not everyone can be a Rachel Weisz. The story could have really powered through all of that, but instead it's too hung up on itself, a bore, a caricature of what it wants to be, and ultimately a waste of time."
" Beautiful Movie
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,9,"I actually went from thinking this was a boring love story to really enjoying it.
The acting was superb, Michael Fassbender acting better than ever and Alicia VIklander was superb.
The story was so well presented that I wondered if it was a true story.
Scenery amazing and the only disappointment was the ending seemed disjointed and rushed."
" The two faces
",2019-06-14 00:00:00,5,"The Light Between Oceans is a wonderfully shot old fashioned romance melodrama.After the end of world war one. A traumatic Tom Sherbourne (Michael Fassbender) feels guilty in surviving the war. He is offered the job of a lighthouse keeper in the remote Australian island of Janus. The lighthouse faces both oceans and Tom crave the solitude.Tom is a silent stoic type, a man of few words. A local girl Isabel Graysmark (Alicia Vikander) is smittened by him and they get married.Although they live happily at the lighthouse, she has miscarried twice. One day they spot a boat with a dead man and a baby girl which by some miracle is still alive.Isabel wants to keep the baby and raise it as her own. No one would know as they think she is already pregnant. However one day, Tom encounters Hannah Roennfeldt (Rachel Weisz) who is looking for her missing husband and child. Tom is overcome with guilt for his and Alicia's actions which eats at him for some years.The story works if you examine it as a series of decisions made by a devastated man. The film is a story of love, guilt, redemption and loss.I found the movie well paced and times moving. It did veer to being a bit too cheesy like a Lifetime film too many times for comfort, but with a prestigious cast. It needed to make use of some kind of lyrical magical realism in its narrative. What else could explain how the baby survived but the father dying."
" Important and touching movie about the love for a child.
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,10,"I cried my heart out because it was relatable.
It teaches us to do the right thing, about forgiveness and that it is Not just normal to have healthy children. Once you are a mother, you will always be a mother (wether the child is with you or not)
The acting was great by the male lead, Alicia, Rachel and the child!"
" Worth waiting...
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,8,"This movie takes a little while to really starts but is worth waiting for the final acts. However I believe that all expressions are full of sense. I only disagree with the one saying ""nothing last"". Love always last, through time and people."
" Terrible film adaptation
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,2,"Even without having first read the novel the screenplay is devoid of the elements that make a cohesive story; the decision to omit Tom's first meeting with Hannah on board the vessel prior to Tom's arrival at Partageuse being the most glaringly poor one. Isabel's 3 miscarriages, the shift of focus from the lighthouse and all its metaphors, the diminishing of Bluey and Ralph's significance as chief protagonists in Isabel's decision to finally reconnect with Tom, these omissions all impact the final rendition. This is reflected in a significantly less visceral experience of love, loss, life and death as portrayed in the astonishingly poignant work of Stedman. It took a while for my disappointment to become apparent. The cinematography is tremendous, depicting the desolation and ferocity of the landscape Tom's character was so drawn to as he succumbed to the need for warmth of human connection.Some of the acting was seemingly affected by the camera presence - see Isabel's reaction to the piano tuning and subsequent miscarriage. (Did she just look at me critiquing the film in my usual scathing manner?)The story seems to lose momentum as it hits the climax and drags on and on with seemingly poor choice in which events to focus on. What a shame the Lulu's first disappearance is left out, with the viewer none the wiser to the pacing of the story and significance of this in Tom's and Isabel's relationship.'Oh dear' moments resounded throughout. I was left feeling I'd watched a patchy storyline and had filled in the blanks as I went. As a first time viewer this would have meant a very superficial reading."
" Emotional, beautiful, heart-wrenching
",2019-02-13 00:00:00,10,"I haven't written a film review for years but having just finished watching this film I felt compelled to. I watched it alone one evening on the offchance of it being an entertaining alternative to watching the football with my husband. Two hours later I was completely gripped, moved, overwrought with emotion and desperate to know how the story would play out. Action-packed it's not, but emotion-packed it definitely is. The cinematography is just beautiful, all of the acting is superb, and the film is highly recommended - as long as you're feeling emotionally up to it!"
" Great film, very sad, but brilliant
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,10,"I haven't cried this much in a long time. This film was brilliantly acted, with a great script, and defiantly deserves better ratings, it was done very well"
" Moral tale in a beautiful place
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,"Such a fantastic location for a moral dilemma take. Well written, fantastically acted and made more special by the fact fasbender met his beau for real here. A must watch if you like a film that has a tale to tell, a dilemma to resolve and love great cinematography."
" A great heartbreaking story
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,8,"As sad as movie is, it is also very engaging and full of emotions. Very powerful acting. I also like movies that are or can happen in real life better. Very good one to watch!"
" Didn't like it
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,2,"Utter trash i couldn't keep watching when the husband saw the sad weeping mother of the child they stole in the graveyard, couldn't see his and his wife's faces anymore"
" I wanted to like it...
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,5,"This had everything i like in a movie. promises to be emotional, wonderful scenery, beautiful music, michael fassbender 😍....so i felt a bit flat actually watching it.It felt like watching a combination of a grimms fairy tale with bleak drama. it's not quite one or the other. it unfolds in a linear process with minimal layers of story telling.I thought there were missed opportunities to really play with the audience's perception of the moral choices. it was also overly long and not well paced.I think the themes of loss and attachment are really powerful. but because the film isn't told from the child's perspective, I think some of this power is dissolved."
" One of the best romantic movies in recent years
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,9,"Let's be frank. The story is a cliche'. It has plot holes, blah blah blah.
But we are missing a big point if we just focus on that. I mean, why do we watch a movie when the story is already in a book?
That's right. We watch a movie because we want to SEE something. The acts, the scenery, the music, etc.The acting was superb. Way beyond the expectations. I was really REALLY surprised that none of the actors were on the Oscar list, especially Alicia Vikander (oh, such a lovely girl!). I mean, seriously? You s**kers have such a poor taste.And the amazing camera work. Just mesmerizing...I do recommend watching this movie and I will watch it again myself if I get the time."
" Slow movie, actions questionable.
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,6,This is very slow but gets interesting when lighthouse keepers Fassbender and Vikander discover the boat. Everything is fine for a while until Fassbender discovers Rachel Weisz inland and the movie goes off the rails with his actions which are questionable. Moral dilemma's occur and it destroys the family cliche mostly because of Fassbender behaviour. Its ok. Worth watching.
" What a gut punch of reality. This movie went up, down and sideways through my heart.
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,10,"Good timing for an old lady who has much experience. What a gut punch of reality. 
This movie went up, down and sideways through my heart. I have had 10 babies over the course of 12 years of my first marriage. 3 were stillborn, the first very similar to the 2 in the movie. 5 more miscarriages so I have experienced every exactly every feeling of loss that these two ladies experienced. I also had legal custody of my young nephew from birth for 5 years until his parents, who had given up theit parental rights to useless to to her mental deficiencies. Then at the age of 5, his parents got back together decided they wanted their son back and went behind our backs through the court so we had no time to prepare him, me, or our family. We experienced a similar separation with screams of ""MAMA"" & ""MICHAEL"" in a very public place. My husband, after 12 years also left and sued for divorce. In those 12 years I was either trying to get pregnant, stay pregnant or recover from loss. He tried to get full custody of both my 2 living children, my12 year old daughter and my 4 year old son. And, at first he won, my relatives were non-existent (I was adopted, and that's a whole other story.) We finally 'settled"" on a miserable joint arrangement.But this movie had me curled up like a ball, splayedeaca across the bed, and kneeling in front of thr TV set as I relived every moment of this exquisitely done movie. My kids are 38 and 30 this year and the this movie made pain return in a snap. I am searching for my parents now, without much luck, but maybe... I could watch this movie over and over again and cry as much every time."
" Too Slow and Boring
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,1,I didn't like the way the grace/lucy discovery and it folded out.
" A touching story
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,9,The story maybe slow but its impact is non the less deep. This has nice cinematography and the performances of the actors literally make you go thru all the feelings and emotions. Vikander is so perfect for such roles. All the actors did perform very well. A joy to watch!
" Beautiful
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,10,I thought the story was incredible! The acting was really good. I would say it is a beautiful film that is a must see
" Engrossing, Powerful, and Satisfying
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,10,"It took three tries to watch this all the way through. The first time I was annoyed by the story line about half way through. The second time I found the story line too painful to stay with about 2/3 through. The third time was a revelation. It was completely plausible and extraordinary in affect. One cannot help but be greatly moved. In the end, there is a great deal of inspiration and satisfaction which is bittersweet. It is one of those films I have savored long after. Both leads are just incredible and though I was already a big Vikander fan, I am getting more and more enamored with the ability of Fassbender. This is a very special film and I hope many more see it all the way through."
" Beutiful, touching film
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,9,"The actors are excellent (especially Alicia Vikander), the scenery gorgeous, the story - moving, reconstructing the reality very well and real. It wasn't so clear what happened in 15 years jump to 1950. It shows values that we forgot in our time. I wish there would be more films like this one. It is a pleasure watching it. I loved it."
" Heartbreaking Story with Magnificent Performances
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,8,"In December 1918, the traumatized military Tom Sherbourne (Michael Fassbender) is temporarily hired as lightkeeper to work alone for six months at a lighthouse at Janus Rock, Australia. He meets the joyful local girl Isabel Graysmark (Alicia Vikander) and they fall in love with each other. Soon they marry each other and Isabel moves to Janus Rock with Tom. Along the next years, Isabel has two miscarriages and while traumatized with her second loss, Tom rescues a rowboat on the shore with a dead man and a baby girl. When he is ready to report the incident, Isabel persuades Tom to keep the baby as if she were their child. The reluctant Tom has difficulties to agree, but keep the baby named Lisa. In Lisa´s baptism, Tom sees the local Hannah Roennfeldt (Rachel Weisz) praying at a grave and he learns that she is the real mother of Lisa. He writes an anonymous note to Hannah telling that her missing daughter is safe and sound. When Tom meets Hannah again four years late, he takes an attitude that will change the lives of many persons.  ""The Light Between Oceans"" is a beautiful film with a heartbreaking story and magnificent performances. It is easy to understand why Tom has difficulties to live a lie based on his rigid military principles but it is difficult to understand why the revelation four years after meeting Lisa´s real mother since he should be aware that his attitude would affect the lives of many people mainly Lisa and his wife. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Luz Entre Oceanos"" (""The Light Between Oceans"")"
" Lovely scenery
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,7,"I haven't read the book, so this based entirely on the film. Loved the windswept grasses on the island, the lighthouse interior, period clothing, especially the knitted baby caps and sweaters, the birds singing in the churchyard rhododendrons, and all the actors. The story was spare, so details matter. I will mention a couple of little plot points that annoyed me: The town was a very small seaside hamlet, (Stanley, Tasmania, pop 481, standing in for fictional Partageuse.) Hannah and Gwen's father, Septimus Potts, was the richest man in town, and a local benefactor. Isabel Graysmark, Hannah and her sister, Gwen Potts, were longtime, (perhaps lifelong?) residents who might have even attended the same school; yet neither Isabel or her parents know who they are, or that Hannah's husband and baby were lost in a rowboat at sea. That surely would have been the biggest news in the little town; it also defies logic that the Commonwealth wouldn't have sent a cable to Tom the Lightkeeper to be on the lookout for a lost baby in a rowboat.Second, while questioning Tom Sherborne, the constable said that Frank Roennfeldt still had ""the (German) accent, by all accounts,"" yet when he was sitting in bed talking about forgiveness with his wife, Hannah, Frank speaks with a perfect English accent.I also thought that Hannah going to Isabel's house and offering to give back Lucy Grace in exchange for testimony against Tom to be unbelievable on the whole, and somewhat cruel to Isabel, ostensibly in an effort to ""do what's right for her daughter,"" after LG ran away. Other than those sticking points, I enjoyed the film."
" Badly paced, unlikely characters, mechanical plot
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,7,"Tom Sherbourne, traumatised on the western front, takes a job as lighthouse keeper on an island off a remote part of the Australian coast. Local young woman Isabel marries him, joins him on his island, but has two miscarriages. Immediately after the second, a dinghy containing a dead man and a live baby washes up on the lighthouse island: Isabel persuades Tom not to report it and to pass off the baby as their own, so he buries the body. At the baby's christening back on the mainland he encounters the child's real mother and finds himself vastly conflicted.I usually start by considering the things I liked about a film: here I have to start with what I didn't like and, what I disliked most was the story. There is an expression in British theatre called ""plonking"" - when the script introduces an element which is obviously solely for the purpose of justifying something which will happen later, it has been ""plonked"" down in front of the audience.
This story is full of plonks. The lighthouse being on an island, the dinghy arriving at the same time as the second miscarriage, the baby's father being German, the mother being at the church at the same time as the christening, the rattle a) being seen by a visitor to the island and b) being small enough to fit in an envelope, her father being wealthy enough to fund a reward about the rattle - all these, and others, are clumsy mechanisms which exist only in order to fit the story together. The reasons for them existing are so obvious that the story appears gracelessly cobbled together rather than organically grown.Added to which, the two main characters, their motivations and actions, are hugely improbable. It may be that the novel does a better job of filling in detail here, but it seems that (for instance) Isabel falls in love with Tom because he took her for a picnic and has an air of melancholy about him. Well, I suppose people have got married for less, but still... These two individuals are more story contrivance than characters.The pacing is all wrong, too. Starting out as a romance, it turns out that it is no such thing: the first hour is all set-up for the actual drama of the second half, and could - and should - have been trimmed.Turning to more positive aspects, Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander are both wonderful actors, and they do an exemplary job - better than the story deserves - of fleshing out these two cardboard cut-outs into living, breathing, halfway-credible people. Rachel Weisz is adequate as the mother.The look of the film is good: the desolate beauty of the isolated lighthouse island is beautifully photographed, and the direction is broadly good, too, albeit the pacing issues can be laid at the feet of writer/director Derek Cianfrance.The mature ladies in the audience who were there because they'd read the book all snuffled dutifully at the end of two hours of blatant emotional manipulation: I fear I remained resolutely unmoved.Looking on the bright side, Fassbender and Vikander became an Item during the filming: think on that as your attention wanders."
" Interesting movie about moral choices and decisions
",2018-05-11 00:00:00,5,"It's slow-paced although much of the content is interesting enough to keep you watching. A second hand on the tiller would have improved the script and direction - yes writer/director again, although he doesn't do a bad job and it is based on a book - but it's worth persevering with if you like a weepie drama.It's a fascinating look at moral choices and the decisions people make. In this case, the decisions are made by the various story members but you might want to ask yourself what you'd do in the same situation.The two leads a superb - Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander - and the scenery is wonderful and atmospheric.Not a movie I'd watch again and you have to like a particular type of movie to enjoy it but give it a whirl and see what you think."
" For everyone's sake get on with it
",2018-04-30 00:00:00,5,"Another movie that could have been very good if there was just one uplifting second. Morose and too moving to be moving, you find yourself shouting at the screen for the story to just hurry up. It's not a complicated story and could have been told in half an hour. Too many short scenes that should have been a lot longer and far, far too many long scene that could have been told in minutes. I haven't read the book so I don't know if any sub plots were taken out to facilitate this piece of hard work. I rarely get an hour into a film and give up watching and I didn't for this one. I wish I had."
" Like the filming...hated the premise
",2018-04-19 00:00:00,6,"These two character were insane. I just cannot figure out who was more insane the woman who wanted to keep another woman's baby or the husband that enabled her to do so. You find a baby in a dingy with a dead man but never think of all the possibilities of why they were there. Maybe the dead man was a kidnapper and the real mother was going nuts looking for her baby or the actual story... a man who dies while in the dingy, for whatever reason, with his baby. There could have been a thousand explanations but these idiots decide to keep their dirty little secret. Who would do that? How come they never heard of this dead man until that day in the church cemetery? Wouldn't a tragedy like that have been front page news on the mainland especially being that the mother of the baby was from a wealthy notable family? And didn't these two on the island come in contact with folks form the mainland periodically? Whew!I found the story annoying and I wanted to smack the female character who stole another woman's baby for completely selfish reasons."
" Wonderful piece of Art and Soul inspiration
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,10,"An absolutely wonderful movie with an incredible Love story and with lessons about the value of Life and of abandoning any resentment. A little too dramatic at the beginning but of course it can represent a real situation, which makes everyone understand without judging the roles. Alicia Vikander and Michael Fassbender outweigh any expectations as to quality of interpretation. Photography, music, ... A work of Art with spiritual and personal inspirations."
" Emotional
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,9,I thoroughly enjoyed this film and cried like a baby at the end. Ending confused me but I don't think anyone can slate this. Truest heart warming
" Love story beautifully written and acted out
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,10,"No words can explain how touched I was when I watched it.. This movie made me pout, smile, tense up, cry, and smile again..made of various kind of love all shown and felt throughout it made me warm inside :)"
" The Light Between Oceans is epic, both in its romanticism and the overabundance of melodrama.
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,7,"There are many moments of sweetness that will make you smile as you wipe away a tear or two (not me...I'm dead inside). But for the most part it's depressing, which is good for me as you all know I do like a melancholic drama. In this tale, a couple reside on a remote island where, after failing to give birth twice, they decide to keep a baby from a boat that has been washed ashore. Riddled with guilt, the husband can't help but contact the real mother who is still mourning her presumed deceased baby. Just that premise alone makes me feel sad. The story as a whole really worked, I was emotionally invested and found the pacing to be consistent...for the first two acts. It starts to lose steam during the final thirty minutes but was pleasantly surprised how quick the time went. It's a tale filled with ultimatums and will evoke the precedent question of ""what would I do in that situation?"". The film explores this well, and Derek Cianfrance's direction was beautiful. I mean he is already an accomplished director, but my word the visual imagery and the landscape shots were breathtaking. Powerhouse performances all round. Fassbender, Vikander and Weisz all fight to own every scene. There's so much acting here that it's difficult to determine if the narrative was overacted or not. I wanted more from Weisz and the screenplay didn't give her the opportunity. Fassbender and Vikander were perfect though, on screen chemistry was electric (regardless of their off screen relationship). Loved the environment of Western Australia and thought the costumes were authentic and captured the post-WWI years very well. Slightly too melodramatic for my taste, clearly giving cues for the audiences when to cry. And it felt like at least fifty letters were being narrated during its runtime. So. Many. Handwritten. Letters. However, I found this to be heart achingly beautiful but just tried too hard at going for awards. Love the title of the film though!"
" Knowing yourself is the outcome
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,9,"What do we do when we encounter a situation where there is no definitive correct course of action? Do your own motivations overtake your moral compass? Most of us are fortunate enough never to be tested in this manner. Until we have each faced such challenging decisions it is impossible to know how we might react. There are no good guys or bad guys. No winners or losers. Just those left to deal with the outcome. I know this completely as I am one of the characters in this story. It is not a story for the faint of heart. If you are emotionally mature enough to withstand an in depth examination of your soul, then give this film a go. It will challenge you."
" Tom showed what life is all about.That is to be courageous and calm in the worst emotional situtations.
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,10,"I really loved the entire story. It touched my heart.The main character Tom showed what is life all about. The moment he came to know about the truth of whom the child belong to, he immediately responded in his best capable ways even in such an emotionally difficult situation. That needs lot of courage.Definetly life of Tom and his wife was worse in the sense they have to go through all this. They were put into helpless situations. Definetly rest of their lives they were living through immense pain and could never have a happy time. It looks like bad things happened to good people.Definetly God wanted that child to be given protection and safely sent back to the original mother. Only a couple like Tom and his wife were capable of that. God knowing their greatness he arranged them to be there at that time. And at the end the child was very grateful for that. Definelty God will be himself obliged and grateful to Tom and his wife for all their thankless life to become an instrument in the ultimate plan of the Lord. Only for such persons to whom God becomes sold out."
" One of the best dramas I have ever seen - worthy every second
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,9,"I am not writing movie review much, however, I could not resist after watching this masterpiece. This movie is undoubtedly one of the best dramas I have ever seen and comparable with some big shots like Philadelphia, Schindler's List or Crash. Frankly, I am surprised that the movie was omitted at Academy Awards and Golden Globes.
Why nine stars? 
3 stars for the cast: The cast is simply great and led by strong performance of Michael Fassbender (one of the best male actor of his age) as an introvert yet very sensitive and upright WWI veteran, followed by Alicia Vikander bringing all range of the femine emotions on the screen from a naive local beauty up to an emotionally destroyed mother (Academy Award worthy) and finally strong performance delivered by Rachel Weisz as loving and forgiving mother. In particular, the chemistry between Fassbender and Vikander is absolutely powerful in portraying of a lovely couple. No wonder :-)
3 stars for the story: The story attracts you from very first moment and is underlined by great casting and cinematography. Every seconds counts and you wish the movie is running longer. You really feel the ethical conflicts of the characters and questioning your own attitude in such matters. These conflicts are very realistic and not pathetic at all.
3 start for movie-making (cinematography, music, etc.): The Light Between Oceans is also very intense because of the very powerful cinematography and music. You really feel a salty cold wind in your face :-)
Where is one star missing? Frankly, I wish we would have experienced more about the period between the time in jail and Isabel's death. It would be interesting to follow their romance. Despite this fact, the movie is amazing and worthy every second. Quite rare feeling nowadays."
" The most beautiful story I have ever seen.
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,10,"The movie starts with little emotion and as the movie progressive it takes you to realm of emotions, it makes you feel the story and makes it very hard not to cry. The movie was brilliant and beautiful worth every tear I must say. This movie takes up a space in your heart and even after it finishes it stays there. A must watch indeed."
" Captain January ...
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,3,".... seems to be the core influence of the story. No tap-dancing curly haired moppets, but the the main gist is the same. JMO."
" Morose
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,7,"A touching story from the beginning, it had me connecting for quite a while. The tragedies suffered by the couple were sad and could be relatable to people trying to start families. The moral questions that this movie raises are controversial. Desperate times, desperate measures, and karma, forgiveness....all these are in there. I found the acting powerful from both Fassbender and Vikander...but I feel the slow pace of the film and the melodramatic second half caused the movie to suffer."
" Thought it would be better
",2018-01-06 00:00:00,7,"While I'm a fan of Michael Fassbender, I was too caught up in the fact the two leads were dating and now married, so I couldn't get emotional, even though the story was pretty sad. I understand he loved her so much to take the fall after they were found out, but after reading the girl from her arms, it just made it worse for her, AND being without her husband. The movie was beautifully shot, I love the sights and sounds of the ocean's crashing waves. It would've made more sense if the Rachel Weisz character knew that Isabel miscarried twice, although she was very sympathetic to not sending them both to jail for a long time."
" Law and duty on one side, basic human need on the other - in fact quite challenging
",2017-12-25 00:00:00,9,"Australian author ML Stedman wrote the book turned into a quite-impressive film by Derek Cianfrance. There are two villains here - a proximate one and an ultimate one. The proximate villain is the miscarriage and how it can affect a young woman (here Isabel Graysmark, played strikingly well by Alicia Vikander). For this reason, I think it is fair to say that this NOT a film for those recently stung by the impact of miscarriage in real life, be they male or female. The ultimate villain is of course the First World War, and its impact on all the world, but notably on Australia itself, where young men unscathed either physically or mentally are a somewhat rare commodity, hence Isabels's interest in Tom, a focus of some chemistry unsurprising perhaps given actor Michael Fassbender's (now) real-life status as Vikander's husband.Even Tom has his issues, hence his desire to flee from civilisation and be a lighthouse keeper on an amazingly remote island which meets the criteria set by the film title in being located where the Southern and Indian Oceans meet (in real life the quite spectacular filming is of a light in New Zealand).When Isabel joins Tom, it looks like their existence might be idyllic - until the above problems put paid to that. But then a chance (entirely dependent on the First World War and its consequences) comes along and they seize it, primarily out of Isabel's yearnings, and it gets them into a great deal of trouble.To say more would spoil what is quite a gripping and occasionally disturbing tale. But suffice to say that it's rather unusual, nicely filmed and thought-provoking in respect of its morality, and in the light of what one might do for love. It also has a quite complex and demanding ending, which I personally found satisfying."
" A heartbreaking story
",2017-11-10 00:00:00,10,"I can't believe it took me over a year before I finally got to see this movie. Tom (Michael Fassbender) and Isabel (Alicia Vikanda) were outstanding in their performances and the scenery was breathtaking.Tom was offered a temporary post for 6 months as lighthouse keeper after returning from the war whilst the occupant of the position was recuperating. Upon the death of the occupant, Tom was offered a 3 year contract which he took. Being a lighthouse keeper was very isolating.On a return trip back to the mainland, Tom was invited for a meal where he met Isabel. The following day Isabel and Tom went for a picnic and she asked Tom if she could write to him when he returned to the lighthouse. Letters went backwards and forwards and finally Tom asked Isabel to marry him. They were both very happy at the lighthouse but, sadly, Isabel suffered two miscarriages. One night whilst at his post in the lighthouse, Tom saw a boat out at sea and both he and Isabel went to investigate. They found a dead man and a baby. Tom wanted to report the finding, as was his obligation, but Isabel, having lost two children, wanted to keep the baby, and this is where things get rather messy. Without going any further into detail, it was a heart breaking story but one well worth seeing."
" Far & Beyond A Mere Chick Flick
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,10,"From the ultra-close face shots very reminiscent of those of Carl Dreyer's 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' to the tender chemistry between the two main characters to the fantastic acting of the 4-year-old version of the orphan, this film deserves the highest rating that can be given. This is, in a way, a chick flick, but in a far deeper way it is a study of right and wrong and how a seemingly innocent decision, designed to alleviate a destructive psychic pain, can set into motion events which spiral out of control and involve many more people than were originally considered. Too, if you love stories set during the Great War, or stories about lighthouses, this one was filmed with you in mind. The limits of true love and marital commitment are put to the test with seeming betrayal and unfounded suspicions--and on a broader scale we see the Christ willing to die in the place of His spouse Humanity after He has been wrongly condemned by her suspicious mind which did not grasp His love for her to the letter of his marriage vow-- which promised her 'better, or worse, 'til death do us part'."
" It's not a movie for television, but it's close.
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,3,"Not that I expected much of this movie, but it has given me little. It is too long and as cold as your picture. In addition photography, when illuminated through the windows, sheds so much light that leaves the actors who look like ghosts.The actors are great, but I do not know why he does not get into the movie.It's one of the worst pictures I've ever seen in American cinema, it does not count, it does not transmit anything, it's ugly and it puts too much light on the windows.The direction is so bad, that often does not know or frame. The planes are ugly and often do not make sense.Of course, I did not expect the end that has, I was surprised in that aspect."
" A tour de force for Fassbender.
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,9,"One of the most poignant love stories I have ever seen. It is so sad that it will tug at your heart. All actors are superb. The script is correct and the narrative believable. Filmed in New Zealand it portrays perfectly the bleakness of the life of a lonely lighthouse keeper. Tom finds love and with it comes tragedy, A must see film for those who love fine acting. The story unfolds slowly and there are no surprises, there is an inevitability about it all, but the ending is quite perfect and satisfactory ."
" Don't fall in love with a mad woman
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,5,"From the very first moment when Tom lays eyes on Isabel he senses he will be dealing with a crazy lady. What kind of lady spends time on her own, ignoring anyone in sight, apart from some hungry seagulls? What kind of lady forces a man into taking her out for a 'picnic' on the very day she meets him, and then, not long after, she forces him into actual marriage? A war distraught Tom falls for the beauty and (in)sanity of Isabel, deciding to take her with him and live in seclusion at the light house. All romantic and nice until she loses two pregnancies, and on the same very day of the passing of her second child, they find a baby in a boat and she forces him into keeping the baby. Kudos for the man for deciding to follow his reason and heart, when he meets the real mother of the child. The film made me feel really upset with the main female character for how she was portrayed, the villain, the insane unable-to-have- her-own-baby-let-me-steal- one mother who could easily say about the man who offered her everything "" I will never forgive that man for as long as I live."" Am I supposed to pity her in any way? I could not. It bothered me so much when she decided to pick up the little girl in the shop and not let her go, making things worse. I think all of it could have been avoided if he did not decide to marry the first one crazy single lady that crossed his path. Also, I think because she is really the villain in this story, she never gets to have closure. She never gets to see ""her"" daughter again. Though wonderfully acted by the actors, great editing, I will have to say I did not enjoy the film as much as it is probably meant to be enjoyed. As a conclusion, I will follow the German dead guy in a boat advice ""You only have to forgive once. To resent, you have to do it all day, every day, all the time. You have to keep remembering the bad things. It's too much work"" and forgive myself for having watched this film, and definitely not recommend it to anyone."
" A love story
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,9,"I really enjoyed this movie and I only write reviews if I seriously think others should watch it. The story and actors are really well directed, the setting is a mix of breathtaking charm, the camera shots leave you inquisitive. It's a love story on many levels, but I don't want to spoil. Good cast and it held my attention from start to finish. It's a smart movie."
" Sad but worthwhile movie
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,9,"I thought this was an excellent movie, though it was too sad to describe it as ""enjoyable"". In my opinion, the struggle within each character to do what is right in contrast to do what would meet his/her emotional needs was well depicted. This was one of the saddest movies I've seen in a long while, and I think it was because it was a microcosm of real life, in which so much seems to go awry. Life is complicated, and this film exemplified that."
" Dragging but Effectivey Moving
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,8,"I really have high expectations from Alicia Vikander. She is an amazing actress. And I could say, she nailed it again.The story is very common so it's up to the actors on how they will convey the emotions in stored. I was getting emotional as the story progresses. I actually cried and only few movies do that to me. So congratulations to all the people behind this film. P.S. I find Michael super hot. Lol"
" Great Drama
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,10,"A great drama again from Alicia. This film showed the real culture of old Europe in a simple film. The town, the island and the scenes were wonderful for a drama story in 1917. Very good Director and Cast. It isn't the first film I watch to Alicia, but this film touched my feelings and I repeated some scenes from every movie I watched because of the complete drama."
" The Light Between Oceans Shines in Multiple Directions
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,9,"Being in awe of the expanse and moods of the sea, as well as the romance and drama of navigational Lighthouses – when my brother-in- law mentioned this movie, just knew it had to be seen. This is a relatively uncommon film by today's standards and it's pleasing to see it actually made money rather than be ignored by younger, action-oriented audiences. Rarely have vistas of a coastal shoreline been captured so stunningly as we see in the Light Between Oceans. Various locations have been lovingly sought out and photographed in a manner that puts the viewer directly 'into the picture'. You feel the power of sea, wind, and the accompanying isolation. Australian authoress, M.L.Stedman's book has been carefully adapted by interesting American director Derek Cianfrance - he and Australian cinematographer Adam Arkapaw apply a great deal of attention to their craft and the effect is at times, an exhausting emotional experience. Under this fine director, all cast members give convincing performances. Michael Fassbender conveys the torment of war memories combined with a decision he's beckoned to make by his new wife – well played by lovely Alicia Vikander (Testament Of Youth). Jane Menelaus (Mrs Jeffery Rush) is touching as her Mother, with British-born Rachel Weisz as a local woman sharing a secret with the light keeper and his wife. I'm pleased the director dropped 20mins from his first cut as the stories pace would not sustain more than 2hrs. If anything may detract from this fine film it might be the timing of finding the babe – otherwise, this is first class modern cinema. Prolific composer Alexandre Desplat provides a nicely arranged, classic style score and the visual montage used under the end credits is artistically masterful."
" More than a box of tissues, a mob and bucket is needed
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,9,"I didn't think films like this were still made. A 'women's weepie' to rival Love Story, pushing all the right buttons. What woman would not want a husband like Tom, played so beautifully by Michael Fassbender, or be willing to accompany him to an isolated lighthouse station for years on end?PLOT SPOILER AHEAD:Everything in this gentle slow paced film was perfect except for a couple of wrong notes beginning with the casting of Rachel Wiesz as Hannah, who at 46 was too old for the part. I realise that acting is make believe and that a good actor can convince the audience of everything, but Ms. Wiesz did not have the benefit of good lighting which would have softened her appearance. I have not read the book, so it may be that Hannah was one of the million or more surplus women who faced spinsterhood after WWI had wiped out almost the entire generation of marriageable men, and had grabbed the young German as a last resort. This would have made her 42 at the time of Grace's birth and 4 years later unlikely to have another chance. Otherwise, she would have more likely been around 24 when Grace was found. Earlier in the film Isabel's father had commented that the Commonwealth would not have had too many applicants for the lighthouse job as there were not too many men around. The speed with which Isabel proposed to Tom on second meeting after mentioning the loss of her two brothers in the war indicated that she was afraid of letting the chance of a husband go by. PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD:I did not feel it necessary to conceal the death of the German. They could have reported it but not mentioned the child. If Isabel's baby was not due, they could have pretended she was still waiting, then announced the birth later. One other failing was with the film not explaining what happened to Tom and Isabel after Isabel had admitted her part in the crime. Did they go to prison as the policeman speculated, or was Hannah able to testify on their behalf and get them off? Perhaps I should get the book, a large box of tissues, a box of chocolates and a rainy night."
" Fassbender and Vikander keep the Lights UP between the Ocean of HEARTS!
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,8,"Romantic, heartbreaking and epic all describe ""The Light Between Oceans,"" a sweeping film based on M.L. Stedman's best-selling novel. Michael Fassbender stars as Tom, a World War I veteran who takes a position as a lighthouse keeper on the isolated island Janus Rock, off the coast of Australia.After the horrors of war, Tom looks forward to finding some peace of mind on the remote island. Then he meets Isabelle (Alicia Vikander), who lives with her family on Point Partageuse, the nearest land to Janus Rock. The two fall in love and get married, with dreams of raising a family in the lighthouse's idyllic location.But parenthood eludes them, as Isabelle suffers not one, but two painful miscarriages, leaving the couple heartbroken. Then Tom spots a boat floating in the middle of the sea. He brings the boat into shore and finds a deceased man and a baby girl very much alive. Tom wants to report the baby to the authorities, but Isabelle feels this is a gift from God, and pleads with him to keep the baby and raise it as their own – which he does, reluctantly.For several years, they raise baby Lucy and live a happy life on the remote island. But on one of their visits to Isabelle's family, Tom encounters a woman (Rachel Weisz) who might be connected to the baby. Tom and Isabelle disagree on what they should do, but either path leads to guilt and heartbreak.You can't go wrong with director Derek Cianfrance (""The Place Beyond the Pines,"" ""Blue Valentine"") paired with the excellent acting skills of Fassbender, Vikander and Weisz. (As a side note, this movie is also the one where Fassbender and Vikander fell in love in real life.)Like Cianfrance's other films, ""The Light Between Oceans"" is moody and dramatic, only with more sweeping cinematography – in this case, of the gorgeous Australian landscape and ocean. Cianfrance makes sure we're fully invested in Tom and Isabelle as characters before upending their happy life for a grief-stricken, uncertain future. This movie is not for the faint of heart. It's rated PG-13, but with themes of profound grief and intimacy torn apart, I'm going with kids aged 15 and older on this one. But it's also a really beautiful film that's worth a look – if you can handle the heartbreaking moments."
" Sound was horrible
",2017-06-21 00:00:00,3,Tried to watch this movie but between the sound of the ocean and the background music it was too painful to try to listen. Seems like a lot of films recently have background music that overwhelms the dialog. I guess the sound engineers are more concerned about their work than the film itself. Too bad as it detracts from the enjoyment.
" Syrupy
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,3,"Too many sunsets, too many dawns, too many minutes (30, at least, perhaps 40) make this film very cloying, sometimes almost unbearable. Pity. The story is not much but it has something, and with a soberer director... Really ridiculous at the end, when Tom says to Lucy: a pity you did not come before (when Isabel was still alive), and she just answers that she couldn't. What the hack was she doing, during 20 years?"
" Problem with sound
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,4,"The story-line is good, but really, one cannot hear what they say, so a lot gets lost. That is really a disappointment. Photography not good - too dark, even if it is a tragic story. I cannot believe that meeting each other so briefly, it could lead to a marriage. The story have gaps. One would have liked a better introduction."
" Classic storytelling in need of better editing
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,5,"Fassbender plays Tom, a traumatized WWI veteran, who wants to spend some months away from humankind, after having survived four years of war. He gets a job as lighthouse keeper and en route to the remote location, he meets young Isabel, falls in love and marries her.Unfortunately, the couple is reproductively challenged and Isabel starts loosing it after the second miscarriage. Then destiny brings on their lonely shores a boat with a dead man and a living baby.Isabel insists to ""keep"" the baby, like a child who found a puppy. Tom is not so sure, but eventually he caves. You can see some tough moral issues on the making, made worse by the fact that the baby's mother is alive and none too happy about loosing her family at sea.In the course of a few years the situation reaches boiling point, with Tom - also suffering from survivor's guilt - deciding to find a solution.The plot develops a bit too slowly and the final part seems contrived to squeeze some more tears from the audience. On the plus point, the photography is great and the locations - albeit very windy - ruggedly beautiful. I also got a weird sense of dislocation, since it was not clear for a while where the story actually took place (not that it is relevant to the plot).Considering the overdose of emotions and moral dilemmas, a tighter editing would have been welcomed."
" ""Finders keepers - Losers weepers""as seen by Ingmar Bergman
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,4,"I wanted to enjoy this because the novel was good but unfortunately much of the edge has been taken off the story in adapting it for the screen.Furthermore the production company has chosen to present it as an ""hommage"" to Northern European 1960s cinema. Significant looks,long brooding silences,a ""locked - in"" male lead in a role Mr M.von Sydow would have had trouble interpreting. The limpid piano music that is sub - sub Mozartian was soporific and repetitive. The wholly serendipitous appearance of a rowing boat containing a baby of exactly the same age as the one tragically miscarried was a plot contrivance hard to swallow in the book but at least there was a detailed and acceptable back story which is only casually referred to in the film. The even more serendipitous discovery that the baby comes from the same town as the childless couple stretched credulity rather further than I would have liked. Mr ""locked - in"" becomes Mr conscience - struck and begins leaving clues in the real mother's letter box and as quick as you can say Jack Robinson the truth is out. The ending comes so abruptly it could almost be considered rude. If this is what joining the Commonwealth Lighthouse Service does to you I can't see surge in the number of recruits,particularly among married men."
" Interesting premise
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,7,"The Light Between the Oceans appears to be a time piece drama set at the end of World War I. Starring Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander as a couple beginning their life together off the coast of Western Australia. The chemistry is what is shown in the film as both leads make their presence felt, and the audience caring for what were are seeing.Foremost, Alicia Vikander puts in an absorbing performance as Isabel, the sparky small-town girl who spies an escape when the new lighthouse keeper is invited. Directed by Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine, The Place beyond the Pines), this film shares some similarities to those films although The light between the ocean may have not received as critical acclaim. Often slow, and calm down, this film is quite interesting but is lacking something to make it stand out."
" I'm not a drama person, But this movie is amazing.
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,9,"After the war Tom applies to a job as a lighthouse keeper in a deserted island. Before he goes there he meets the beautiful Isabel and after a while they get married and she moves with him to the deserted island. The rest , wheel you have to see it and i assure you you won't be sorry of taking the time to watch this movie.Like i said, i prefer sci-fi, horror , thriller, so i started watching this movie without many expectations, but after a while the story just keeps you glued to the screen.Good acting, beautiful island, and great story, i found myself really emotional on the end of this movie, love at the best, even you're doing the wrong thing for the right reasons. Please watch this movie, you won't be sorry."
" It did not end happily for me
",2017-05-05 00:00:00,7,"This was an amazing story with a lot of twists. The scenery is beautiful. It felt that it was impossible to know how this movie would end. I do not think it gives the conclusion away to say that I thought the ending was unhappy. I'm sure that others may disagree with me. When a movie is fictional, as this one is, I do not know why the writer would want us to feel sad at the end!"
" Stealing isn't nice...
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,5,"When you truly love someone you'll go to jail for them!I love Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander but in this movie the pace moved like a turtle stuck in molasses. The story tugs and pulls at your emotions way too much. The movie might have been better if it were shortened by 30 minutes or so. Ugh. I tried to read the book, I did manage to make it all the way through the movie. But yuck."
" beautiful and slow
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,6,"It's December 1918. Tom Sherbourne (Michael Fassbender) returns from the war tired and seeking isolation. He takes a job at a remote lighthouse and marries local girl Isabel Graysmark (Alicia Vikander). She has miscarriage after miscarriage. One day, they find a boat washed ashore with a baby and a dead man aboard. She wants to keep her and convinces Tom to cover up the discovery. He learns of Hannah Roennfeldt (Rachel Weisz) who lost her husband Frank and their baby when a mob chased the German to row out into the sea.This is beautifully filmed but slow as heck. There is limited tension. It is overwrought and a big emotional epic. Being over two hours does not help. The first half hour lacks any tension with the no drama courtship. There is a flatness to the start of the movie that throws the rest into jeopardy. It never picks up enough speed to truly get started. It would be an easy fix but the movie is intentionally without action. Tom is haunted by war but the movie doesn't show any war scenes. Frank's escape from the mob could be heart-pounding but it doesn't show that either. The story-telling seems very old fashion but it's darn beautiful. By the time the movie get emotionally epic, it had already spent almost two hours of bumping around."
" good movie but slow
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,7,"Once again I say Michael Fassbender has finally come into his own. This movie was very well done although on the slow side. I've been told it follows the book, which I never read. There moments when you just want to jump through the screen and straighten everyone out but all in all I would highly recommend this movie."
" A tale of imbalance between love and grief.
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,8,"The film was based on the Australian novel of the same name. It was a recent book, but a period drama about a World War I veteran who just returned home. So I feel this film was made too soon. Because it seems so classic, only if we had given some time to pick up its popularity. I mean the literature version which at least needed a decade of freedom before heading to the big screen. You know, this same kind of tales from the past is what now we consider epic, which looks even better in the cinema. Anyway, this film was good, but the future adaptations will be much more effective for its viewers.From the director of 'The Place Beyond the Pines' who also wrote for the screen. The title gives a brief insight of what kind of a tale it is. But the film was even deeper and darker with emotionally strong. The island where it takes place reminded me 'Song of the Sea', though it is not a fantasy film. If you love views, nature, particularly seaside, this film will suit you.Besides, the story was much stronger, so the backgrounds will fade away when all your focus fall on its narration. For me the location was the first in the film, the hundred year old setting, away from normal society was the most impressive. It helped to narrate this wonderful drama which contained the message of moral imbalance.Tom Sherbourne, a World War I hero who relieved from the duty returns home and becomes a lighthouse keeper in an isolated island on the west coast of Australia. He marries a woman whom he has instantly fallen in love. Now they are living far from the human world. A couple of tragedy strikes in their life following one another.Before coming out of that trauma, they find a baby on a lifeboat that washed up on their island and decides to adopt her. But after some times when they return to the mainland, they come to realise what they're doing is not legally nor morally correct. From onwards how it affects their each others trust, how far it all goes and how the story ends was told in the remaining parts.❝You only have to forgive once. To resent, you have to do it all day, every day.❞Despite the book was modern, the storytelling was so vintage. I'm talking about the way the plot and characters developed, including how it concludes. For the present generation, if you are familiar with a few similar works from the past, then you would predict this film. I mean not the entire film, but some scenes are at its initial stage can be foreseen. Because sometimes, some developments are called coincidence, but when you have plenty of them, that is called very intentional. That was the only negative of this film. By avoiding them the tale would not be possible. In other way, it could have had stretched even further which are unnecessary details.I did not care the clichés. For me it was a fine drama. The performances were magnificent. It looked to me an Oscar worthy, from both Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander. Even Rachel Weisz was for the supporting role. So tick marks for cast and locations, also the screenplay and score. But the sad part is the film was not received very well, especially by the jackass film critics.It's not the same case with regular movie goers, particular I think the older and matured people would like it better. But it's not another 'Pride and Prejudice' from the family audience perspective. The events of the film and the outcome can be wrongly judged. Most importantly, it sets in the same world as ours, so everything is the near fact based. So the right and wrongs are inside the film, but not applicable for the filmmaking which I think a well done job.The post climax scene, the one that comes before the end credit was very good. For this kind of tale, that kind of outro sets a final tone. Despite not an inspiring storyline, all the portrayal in the film was so poetic. Mainly because of slow narration with high influence of sentiments and most of the occasions being dialogueless. The length was not an issue if you like period dramas. Anyway, it was engaging theme, there's always something keeps happening. So I think this is one of the under-rated films of the year. It deserves much better recognition. If you haven't watched it yet, I recommend it and highly if you are 30+.8/10"
" Moving, well made and absorbing film from Australia.
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,8,"Michael Fassbender plays Tom Sherbourne who is a returning veteran from 'The Great War'. In an attempt to find peace after the violence, death and din of the Western Front he applies to be a relief lighthouse keeper on a remote and solitary island.En route he meets the beautiful and vivacious Isabel Graysmark (Alicia Vikander), he is rather taken with her and she is drawn to him. Despite the separation of his stint on the island she is still keen upon his return. The fortunes of their relationship though will ebb and flow like the tides that carry the boats past the lonely lighthouse. Soon those self same tides will bring some flotsam that will change both their lives forever.Now this is an historical romance first and foremost but it is also a story of love in all its forms and how true love can affect someone to their very core. It is beautifully filmed, the acting is exceptional and the score is pretty much perfect for a film of such majestic leanings and ambition. It is over two hours long too but seems like mere minutes such is the force that it carries – completely recommended."
" A fabulous film
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,9,This is a fabulous and understated film. Beautifully shot. The story and its development are excellent. Realistic and not at all clichéd. You are never quite sure where the film is going to end up. It is not your typical predictable Hollywood-style garbage. A great rainy Sunday afternoon entertainer.
" Well done. But....
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Honestly, my wife and I watched the trailer to this before renting and the dang trailer almost had us in tears. Lol. However, I didn't agree with the outcome. Could have been a much better ending. Trying to explain without spoilers. It's well worth the watch. And you'll probably be battling some serious tears, then let us know what you thought of the story and ending."
" A powerful moving drama delivered by Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,8,"The Light Between Oceans is a romantic drama that delivers an outstanding performance from Michael Fassbender, Alicia Vikander, and Rachel Weisz. All while delivering a sympathetic story about love and guilt and really tries to pull all these strings to get an emotional reaction out of you. The plot follows Tom (Michael Fassbender), after being haunted by his past in World War I. He moves to a lighthouse, where he can try to find peace within himself. He falls in love with a local girl Isabel (Alicia Vikander). She moves with him in an isolated island in a lighthouse. She gets pregnant and hoping to start a family. And she miscarries. Leaving them devastated. Until, a boat arrives to shore with a baby in it. They both raise the baby as their own, hiding the truth from the town folks about their miscarriage. And the baby that was drifting on a boat. Only until Tom discovers that Hannah (Rachel Weisz) lost her husband and her baby girl out in the sea when their ship supposedly was ship wrecked. Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander were great with their performances. Every time, they were on screen, it was hard to take eyes off the screen. They both are very talented and their work shows. Fassbender playing a war veteran, who is still traumatized from his war experiences. Faces the conflict of living a lie and hiding the truth. Vikander is so stunning, she is gorgeous and her performance is great playing a character that is lost and depressed after the incident. Director Derek Cianfrance tried to build a romantic story about two characters falling in love and an incident strikes them both. Only to be given another chance, when a baby shows up that fixes the missing link with what they both were wanting. The consequences of hiding the truth for there own good. It all comes down to if they rather live a lie. Or face the exposed truth that can break them apart. Cianfrance does well in making this drama unsettling, even as two lovable characters are facing the conflict of losing their happiness. The film does have some beautiful cinematography camera work in capturing the landscapes of the island and the ocean view. Also, capturing these two characters building a lifestyle of living alone on the lighthouse island. The one thing I did not like about The Light Between Oceans is the slow moving pace. It does have a strong drama conflict that can make the audience feel unsettled and messing with the emotions as it pulls the heart strings seeing these characters fall apart. The first two act of the film is very slow moving. Slowly building up with Tom arriving in town and meeting the town folks. Meeting Isabel and the picnic date that they began falling for each other. To writing messages to each other talking about their future. Otherwise, The Light Between Oceans is a good drama period that pulls the emotional strings with these characters, delivering amazing performances, and capturing some beautiful settings."
" Very touching movie that makes you think about the hard decisions in life
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,8,"When the movie started, it seemed to be boring and slow paced. It is little dull in the first 20 minutes but after that you will be fully immersed in the movie. It is a touching movie that makes you how much a person can get desperate to have a child to raise. This movie made me tear several times. All of your body will shiver while watching it. I recommend this movie as it has a strong message to deliver. It will make you think about life and family several days after watching the movie. I am a father and understand how much joy a girl brings to her father and how devastating it is not to be able to have kids for your own."
" Tragedy Or Not?
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,8,"The majority of the movies being made today are made for young people. They almost always involve some overuse of CGI, foul language/humor or are a remake/sequel. Now don't get me wrong, none of these things necessarily make for a bad movie. But dramas of late have been severely lacking. Not only that they rarely get noticed. So when a solid, decent drama comes out that I'm made aware of I like to let others know about it. THE LIGHT BETWEEN OCEANS is one of those movies.Michael Fassbender stars as Tom Sherbourne. Recently returned from four years of service during the First World War, Tom is a bit shell shocked and withdrawn. Coming back to New Zealand, he takes a job as a fill in at a lighthouse until the regular keeper can return. The seclusion of the lighthouse combined with the death of his wife left that previous keeper a bit off. Miles away and only reachable by boat, Tom takes to the tasks at hand with ease and the solitude as well, a man lost in his own thoughts.All of this changes as he begins thinking about a young woman he met the day he first went off to the lighthouse. Isabel Graysmark (Alicia Vikander) is the young daughter of a local school master. Her family has suffered from the war as well with both of her brothers having given their lives. When Tom returns to the mainland for a few days, he courts Isabel and eventually the two wed and head out to live their lives together on the island lighthouse station.The pair love being together. Isabel returns Tom to the land of the living, a sense of renewed hope that life can go on. When she becomes pregnant even more so. But she loses the child. And then another. Miraculously after the death of the second child Tom sees a dinghy nearing the shoreline. He rushes down to find a man now deceased and an infant child. The baby is fine and Isabel takes care of her. Tom wants to notify the authorities but Isabel convinces him to stay silent for the night.The next day she continues on. She tells Tom that this is a sign that the child was meant to arrive there. Guilt ridden over what has happened, Tom agrees to her plan. He buries the dead man and the two begin to raise the child as their own, naming her Lucy. So much so that they send word that this is the baby that Isabel was carrying.But that guilt will prey on Tom's mind. When they gather together with Isabel's family to christen the baby he sees a woman, Helena (Rachel Weisz) in the nearby cemetery mourning at a graveside. Looking at the tombstone after she leaves he sees she lost her husband and infant child to the sea at the same time Lucy arrived on their island. The story changes then from a couple trying to raise a child that seemed destined for them to a tale of a woman whose only love, her husband and child, were taken from her still searching for them. Their stories coincide as the guilt weighs on Tom's conscience, Isabel's determination not to surrender the child grows and Helena's search for her child leads her to them.The film moves along at a slower pace than most but that's because the story is unfolding before us rather than being tossed slapdash upon the screen. We develop and understanding of the characters of Tom and Isabel before we see them thrown into the difficulties that occur in their lives. We see them develop a deep rooted affection for the child they have raised. And we see the possibility of even deeper pain that could come should they be forced to surrender that child. But we're not unsympathetic to Helena at the same time. Her pain is just as relevant and just as intense. It boils down to two sets of characters that viewers can support no matter which way it ends.Fassbender is becoming one of my favorite actors. He makes the roles he chooses, be it Tom here or Magneto in an X-Men movie more real than most would believe. He's making wise choices, playing action heroes and taking on more serious roles at the same time. Vikander is making a name for herself as well, be in in sci-fi films like EX-MACHINA or the film version of THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. In this film we witness her joy and pain and confusion over just what to do. Weisz has always done an amazing job and she continues here, although her part seems small in comparison to the two leads.As I said at the start, it is rare to see movies like this these days. While all movies have an audience out there my hope is that this one will find the one that it missed at the box office. Those that are willing to take the journey, to embrace the seclusion of the lighthouse life and to decide for themselves just who should be raising this child will walk away feeling satisfied at a well-made drama that may just stand the test of time."
" Beautifully Heartwrenching
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,9,"As many have said, The Light Between Oceans has an old world feeling about it. Aside from being story driven, it also doesn't wrap things up in a neat little bow like so many films today.I must admit, that as conflicts increased I began to question my initial positive feelings about the film. However, by the time it ended, they were confirmed, despite the emotional roller coaster we, the viewers, are forced to endure.Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander have a wonderful chemistry together and are both quality actors. Their portrayals of Tom and Isabel pull you in and make you feel everything they are feeling right alongside them.I'm reading the book in tandem with having seen the movie. Together or apart, the film is worth watching."
" Soundtrack problem
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,8,"I am mostly enjoying this movie, watching it on DVD, the cinematography is quite beautiful, the characterisation is pretty good I think, even if the casting is not perfect they have done a good job. I read the book about a year ago so know the story, which was my main reason for choosing to watch this movie, the book was such a great read. My only issue is parts of the soundtrack. The sound editing isn't the best. The background music is often too loud especially if there was dialogue at the same time. And I find a lot of the dialogue too quiet, it is very often quite a strain to hear, if I didn't know the story I would be a bit lost at times."
" A movie illustrating ""real life""
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,8,"The light between oceans is a movie about forgiving, letting go, even if it really hurts. People go through so much in life, and under varying circumstances, make decisions that are neither wrong nor right. But that's life, everyone has needs, and events sometimes occur for no clear purpose, cruel as it may be, perhaps its just to help us learn to forgive and let go. No one was the complete victim nor the definite guilty in this movie, the characters just arrive at where they are from all that they've been through. Which made this a tear-worthy movie, seeing the main characters suffer partially from their own doings yet not. I give it an eight out of ten, definitely a movie that illustrates how ""real life"" is. The composition of the scenes had a calming effect to it, coupling with the plot, helps quiet the mind and provoke feelings in the heart."
" 'You only have to forgive once. To resent, you have to do it all day, every day.'
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,9,"M.L. Stedman's novel THE LIGHT BETWEEN OCEANS has been beautifully transcribed to the screen by writer/director Derek Cianfrance ('The Place Beyond the Pines', 'Blue Valentine' etc). Thought he story takes place in Australia, the elected filming location was New Zealand, sharing some of the most beautiful vistas we've seen in a long time. The story's tagline – 'Love demands everything' - is very well chosen.The movie opens in 1918 with Tom Sherbourne (Michael Fassbender) traveling by boat to a remote village off the coast of Western Australia. He has accepted the temporary position of lighthouse keeper on the island of Janus Rock. Janus Rock is a small island linked to the mainland, and only visited by boat four times a year by the shopkeeper, Harry, who brings grocery orders, supplies and mail. Because of Janus Rock's remote location and isolation, it was a difficult post to fill before Tom took it over. The permanent lighthouse keeper will return to his job in six months. Tom visits the mainland, meets Isabel (Alicia Vikander), and after a whirlwind romance they marry. Tom and radiant, spirited Isabel live together in married bliss on Janus but their windswept world is turned upside down when after two miscarriages Isabel learns that she's unable to bear a child. One day, a drifting lifeboat washes ashore with a deceased man and crying baby in it. The dilemma the couple now face will echo far beyond the island, engulfing and irrevocably impacting their world -- and that of a stranger Hannah Roennfeldt (Rachel Weisz) -- in a passionate story about love, hope, and a fateful choice. The manner in which the decision is made as to who should keep the now four-year-old Lucy/Grace (Florence Clery) involves concepts of birth mother versus adopted mother, guilt in deciding how love plays in the role of justice, and any number of other issues so beautifully managed by the story and the script and the actors.The well-assembled supporting cast includes Thomas Unger as the critical decisive character of Bluey, Jane Menelaus and Garry McDonald as the parents of Hannah (whose frightened German husband Frank (Leon Ford) attempted to escape with their baby when prejudice against Germans broke out in their town), and others. Alexandre Desplat provides the moody musical score and the cinematography is the work of Adam Arkapaw. The film is majestically beautiful to see and carries messages that ask the viewer to think, to consider, to understand. A bit long at 133 minutes but the cast handles the story beautifully."
" Outstanding
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,9,"Outstanding, Fassbender's, Vikander's and Weisz's performances, not to mention the rest of the crew, either you have it or not, this is chemistry from the finest, filmed and surrounded in an incredible landscape, they choose to place the lighthouse in the middle of this story like a symbol of hope, love, despair, loneliness and courage, what would we do or choose in such a situation, a lie remains a lie as little it is, even for the sake of the one you love, what a tragedy, one bad decision changed the life of all concerned and there seemed to be no hope, but fortunately forgiveness and unconditional love triumphed in the end, superb!"
" The Light Between Oceans(2016) - Predictable but beautiful
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"Usually when I start the tagline with predictable, it is usually followed by passable or formulaic but this time I have to give it to the movie. The setting of the movie, in itself, is so picturesque and the cinematographer, Adam Arkapaw did a splendid job by using the scenery to complement every emotion and scene.SCREENPLAY - I haven't read the book, so those who have read it, please don't come at me with pitch-forks. The director, who is also the writer of the screen-play, I think has done a marvellous job because it gave me the feeling that I am actually reading a book. Now, the major problem lies in the fact that you don't read a book in one go. I know some who do, but I don't and there lies the problem. The first one hour has been put onto the screen very aptly, but the second half begins to drag due to over-expository sequences. I think the second half could have been a little more tighter because the second half had more going on in it. Now, you may think that if there is more going on then it should take more time. My answer to that is ""No"", because the events of the 1st half had made the 2nd half a bit predictable so what is the point of prolonging it? DIRECTION - The director of The Place Beyond the Pines(2012) comes back after a humongous gap of four years. Dude has something to do with bleakness, right? He is also the director of Blue Valentine(2010) and I never finished that movie. It was too depressing for me. This man knows how to make you smile and then just snatch it all away from you. He has full control over the emotions of the character and the emotions of the audience and he puts that to full use. This movie reminded me of Lootera(2013). If you haven't watched it, I strongly recommend you to watch it. Now, where Lootera succeeds and this movie lags behind is the final intimate moments. It was captured in the first half of the movie so well but completely faltered in the second half. That is why some things during the final moments of the movie felt a bit rushed.ACTING - I saw a movie of Michael Fassbender a few days ago and now I am seeing this and I am in awe. He doesn't make any major changes in his physicality or any noticeable changes but he transforms into the character he is playing. He has played a mutant, a war veteran, a thief and an assassin, all in the span of one year and he is every bit convincing as each of those characters. Alicia Vikander is also a force to reckon with. She defines the word finesse. It's not in the dialogues in which she portrays her emotions, but it's in the little things. Those little things cannot be taught in an acting school. It's sheer talent and I admire her for that. Rachel Weisz, also gives a subdued yet powerful performance. I think I saw her last in The Lobster(2015), which is also one of my favourite movies. I just saw that they had used multiple actresses for Lucy/Grace for each age and I have to say, all of them were cute and amazing.FINAL VERDICT - I am no fan of love stories. I have a handful of love stories which I like watching. Though this does not make the list, but it is certainly worth a watch due to the performances of Vikander and Fassbender. I mean, I can watch Vikander and Fassbender for hours reading a book and simultaneously emoting every single moment in it. That too will be worth watching, I suppose."
" The acting is good but the movie drug way too much for it to have the emotional impact it tried for.

Isabel talks him into keeping the child for their own. Tom hesitates but agrees. After meeting a woman who could be the mother he has a difficult choice to make. This was a movie that I was worried about watching because I expected something super depressing. While this isn't a happy movie at all it wasn't nearly as sad as I expected, but I think it had to do with the fact that the movie was just a little too slow for me to get invested in. That's not to say this is a bad movie at all but I really struggled with it. When done right movies like this have a lasting impact, Atonement comes to mind, but for me it was just too slow moving and repetitive for me to really invest in fully. Overall, the acting is good but the movie drug way too much for it to have the emotional impact it tried for. I give this a C+."
" The Worst Movie Ending I've Ever Watched
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,1,"I've never watched a movie ending as heartless as this movie. I think that's the reason why this movie failed terribly in terms of box office and being overlook in award season. I feel pity for Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander effort. They gave one of their best performance in this movie but it was overshadowed by the worst ending. The blame all goes to Derek Cianfrance of course. Because he is the one who wrote the screenplay and direct the movie. The movie is so good before the ending comes. The movie shows a few signs as a hope for Tom and Isabel but it suddenly goes anti climax. If you don't want to give them happy ending, at least do not give any hope to the audience. If you want to give the ending as in the book then make the story as what written in the book, don't change the story then you give the ending as the novel."
" The Vidiot Reviews...
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,6,"The Light Between OceansA surefire way to get pregnant is to pretend you're high school students with bright futures.However, it's going to take divine intervention for the married couple is this drama.Shell-shocked solider Tom Sherbourne (Michael Fassbender) returns to Australia a changed man. Choosing the solitary existence of a lighthouse keeper, he takes up correspondence with a mainlander (Alicia Vikander), whom he later marries.After two failed pregnancies, one day a rowboat washes ashore with a newborn aboard that the couple raises as their own. But news that the babe's mother (Rachel Weisz) still lives tears the lighthouse keeper's family asunder.Beautifully shot and finely acted, this adaptation of the Aussie bestseller skillfully explores survivor's guilt from a trio of perspectives, each with their own personal pathos. Nonetheless, that suffering slowly becomes taxing and ultimately depressing. Furthermore, performance anxiety is perfectly normal when you live inside of a colossal blinking penis.

" Beautiful story about sacrifice, forgiveness, selflessness, tragedy and love.
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,9,"The Light Between Oceans (2016) is a beautifully well-told story about sacrifice, forgiveness, selflessness, tragedy and love. Every major character within this story is faced with a moral dilemma surrounding an infant who was lost at sea with her father and the decisions that were made by a couple living on an island lighthouse to keep her when they found the infant in a small rowboat washed up on the coast with her father who had passed.Every character is well developed and I could not help to feel for each of them and what they were going through. Each one faces a moral dilemma between their own self-interest and sacrificing their wants for the great love of doing what is best for a child. This film gave me a lump in my throat that sunk heavy in my stomach as the film progressed, and in the process reminded me to be less selfish and more giving towards others. I won't go into the details of the film because the film's descriptions pretty much set up the plot and the less you know going into the movie, the more powerful its' moral points might affect you as it did me. If you are the compassionate type, you will love this film."

" Slow but there is a story
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,6,This slow moving story is beautifully filmed and well acted. There is something that reminds of an abducted child lifetime custody battle movie but with more A list actors and a historic setting. The story is surprisingly well structured story that comes together. Things could have been rushed a bit.A childless couple who live on an island with a lighthouse come across a baby in a boat and decide to keep it as their own. But later they come across the mother of the child.Alicia Vikander is good at acting sad. Michael Fassbender and her act well together - hence the real life romance. Rachel Weisz is a little out of place.Not a must watch.
" I don't read books, I watch movies
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,9,"I don't read books, I watch movies. The only books I read are Comics. Also I don't appreciate people that exhibits vulgar display of power like the ones that posts: ""Uh! I prefere the book...oh! the book is much better...OH! you should read the book...Oh! i can read...and yes, I read books, I'm smart...I'm sofisticated"". Saying that, I think this movie is great. Loved it. Fassbender is one of the best actors alive. Love all his work. The pace is alright, the cinematography not bad, the story is good. But the drama, the interpretations, the dilemmas, the moral issues, are much more intense than any other movie i saw during the last decade. I think that it's impossible not feel very strong emotions when watching the movie. Actually I think it's impossible not to cry. I only wish that the soundtrack would be more envolving and intense. I mean it's not bad, but there's no ""Vangelis"" or ""Zimmer"" material here. And this movie deserves an epic song. It's very very strong. It's very very intense. One of the best dramas I ever saw. And like i said if you don't cry, i find it weird."
" A little too melodramatic, but well shot and interpreted
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,6,"The plot does not make the beauty either of a book or a movie. This is the case with ""The light between the oceans"", where the predictable and sometimes too melodramatic plot is still able to awaken the emotional involvement of the viewer thanks to its cinematography and acting. I liked the slow but poignant shooting, able to capture the characters' emotional inner world, thus transcending the melodramatic imprinting of the story. And I also appreciated the delicacy of the couple's love story and the sober but intense interpretation by Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikande, and Rachel Weizs also added something valuable. The moral issue of what doing the right thing means is probably too simplistically faced as well as the meaning of parenthood and raising a child. On the whole, the form was far better than the content, but still enjoyable."
