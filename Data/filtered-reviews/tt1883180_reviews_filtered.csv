" Cinema Omnivore - A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence (2014) 7.9/10
",2021-04-01 00:00:00,8,"""In A PIGEON..., two traveling novelty salesman Jonathan (Holger Andersson) and Sam (Nils Westblom) are the token leads, their 3-fold merchandize is too dreary to enliven anyone's life, which is enfolded in multifarious sketches, off the top of yours truly's head, notable ones include the three incidents about death in the beginning, a rotund flamenco teacher relentlessly fondles her student, a poem indicates the film's title, a pair's post-coital smoke break, a lab experiment on a monkey, among others. There are also anachronistic skits, the ones about King Karl XII (1682-1718), marching armies filtering in the background like a painting in motion, to an expedition against Russia, the young King even takes a fancy to a young boy (inviting him to stay in his tent), Andersson's humor is dry and perverse, when the King returns in the wake of the battlefield debacle, he can barely walk, his command of using the bathroom is met with another kick in the teeth.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks."
" Swedish Melancholy
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,6,"The film contains several episodes featuring two salesman and their encounters with other people. Especially towards the end, it becomes more and more clear that director is aiming a shot at Sweden and its politics (""Is it ok to use other people for your needs?"") Although it gives good pleasure to watch, my feeling is that it does not transcend above the borders of Sweden. Stories are strongly linked with the country and its people. Still recommended though, to get to know this extraordinary director. One should check About Endlesness for stories with more global connection."
" Motion Comic Strip
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,9,This movie is so unique. It reminds the traditional comic strips in newspaper. I find it's quite humorous.
" I'm glad to hear you're doing fine - a Clockwork Existence
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,8,"Although this film is pitched as a Swedish 'Comedy' it is actually more of a morbid observation of human existence in todays world. A loose collection of small vignettes tenuously held together by some recurring characters, this film is not for everybody and is certainly strange. Very slow pace and a 'plot' that meanders may put a lot of general movie goers off seeing this. If you are into Art movies - or even slightly 'odd' ones - this may be rewarding. The REAL thrust of this Film is to highlight just how we have all been bogged down in 'routine' and just keep turning the treadmill towards death. Doesn't sound like a laugh - and for much of this film - it certainly isn't. Looked at from a certain point of view it shows how sad and appalling our 'modern' lives have become. People stuck in 'dead' Jobs, dead relationships, dead lives, until all these people have left is their base routine going round and round. There are other observations - the Hubris of Charles XII's Army as it leaves for an utter defeat - and slaves being being forced into a metal cylinder to tread it around and around (for an audience of obviously wealthy Capitalists).
Overall, this Film is NOT for every viewer but it does have something devastating to observe about the way the current world is.
Like machines, human beings now just spout soundbites - all through the movie people are heard to say ""I'm glad to hear you're doing fine"" - even when you know that is FAR from the truth."
" Monty Python and Buñuel made it better
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,6,"Swedish surrealist dark humor, innovative but sluggish. After many stupid deaths, two unfunny sellers of joke articles meet Buñuel and Monty Python throw windows and inside musical pubs in the lands of king Karl XII. Yes, nonsense. More visual than substance. More weirdness than laughs."
" Symbolism
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,9,"The use of verbal/ visual symbolism was great. The film was more poetic for me. There were sentences which needed to be encrypted with care, which would eventually lead to a state of enlightenment after decoding them.
This was a philosophical art work.
The symbolism of vampire teeth, laughing bag,mask were relating to the greediness of people, absence of true happiness and pretending like others behind masks was great."
" 1 Hour and 50 Minutes of Brilliantly Dark and Depressing Cinema
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,8,"A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence is certainly not a film to watch when feeling down or hopeless, as it may just take the last remains of faith in human happiness away. This film is certainly not a fun watch, however it does have merit if you can handle 1 hour and 50 minutes of brilliantly dark and depressing cinema.As the third installment of Roy Andersson's 'Living' trilogy, it acts as the crescendo in Andersson's studies on the human condition, which is the focal point of these deadpan, deeply dark and ironic studies of humans. The deep irony is that the loose narrative follows two novelty items salesmen that state the reasons for doing so is to bring fun and joy to people, despite being two of the most melancholic characters ever to have appeared on screen. Their slow shuffling walk, paired with their hunched over postures mirror the pain of the world they inhibit, with one of the pair suffering from depression and dark dreams, including a particularly hard to watch scene where a line of people are marched in and burned alive in an enormous brass barrel as a group of elderly people watch on whilst being served cocktails.The expertly composed still frame which is present in each equally odd scene puts the viewer at an awkward distance from the action. We are far away enough to feel like voyeurs of the absurd nature of each scene, but close enough to see the details on the characters pale white face painted faces. As the viewer, you find yourself studying every element of the frame in great detail, noticing small things that add to such small nuances to each character, for example a soldering iron in one of the salesmen's bedrooms in their prison-like residence. The colour palette also adds another element as the pastel tones of the expertly dressed sets are pulled out and build another layer of melancholic feeling to this raw and unforgiving tale of human disgustingness.Just when you feel like the scene is making sense in some strange otherworldly way, something will happen to throw you off completely, the best example of this being when a seemingly normal bar scene comprised of slow, awkward dialogue (which most of the film is) turns completely when an army enters a bar on horseback and removes all of the women from the establishment. This happens often and it cannot be avoided that Andersson likes to bring attention to humans historical ugliness as well as our contemporary condition too, with this film stitching them together somewhat seamlessly in the creation of this absurd, but also recognisable other 'world'."
" Review
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"A pigeons dream. It sat on a porch. It stared at the life stream. Which are millions of invisable orders swooping around intentionally, cramming into the heads of living things. When the pigeon woke up from this dream he looked up. There was tall man eating a piece of pizza, it was blinding out because of the sun."
" Probably my favorite movie
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,10,Its first scenes are the best cinematographic work of this century. No s**t. Must watch.
" Rubbish Arthouse for the foolish.
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,1,My Rating : 0/10Very pretentious arthouse.It is original but what's the point?Boring. Dull. Meaningless. Sad that critics always rate these types of movies high.
" What an unusual find
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,10,"The title is A Pigeon sat on a branch relflecting on it's existence. Now if you picked up a book w this title or better yet a poem , what would you expect? 
So now you see this movie recommend because of in my case the Sweedish series "" Occupied "". So this is connected in some way. Plot? no, thriller ? no, mood? maybe a lil, home language of the film? I believe so. But who cares. There are bits of humanity here sad, ironic, absurd, humerous, bleak, anachronistic and surreal. I guarantee you will come back to this movie and some of the images will stay w you. I would like to see more of this director. It almost makes you want to write or create something . Once again I say the title is A Pigeon sits on a branch reflecting on its existence, what are you expecting. Just enjoy a total different kind of film."
" Bouncing between two extremes
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,7,"Pigeon is made in the same style as You, the Living. Again we have plenty of short scenes, shot from one angle, with no cuts. Filled with absurdity, no actual plot, various way of interpretation. Too deep or too obvious, Andersson bounces between two extremes. The characters and the scenes are overdrawn. Everything happens in one, slow pace. Silence is boring and dulling the vigilance. In comparison, You, the Living seemed more... lively.If Andersson shows Swedish society, I felt the criticism towards it in one scene, mocking it in the second and a direct reference to it in the third. The critique is present in a scene with elderly elegant Swedes observing the cruelty, done by non-Sweden. For me this is a reflection on Swedish neutrality in the 20th century. Mocking the Swedish society appears in the last scene. Bunch of people is waiting at the bus stop and one of the men starts to ask if today it's really Wednesday, cause for him it felt like Thursday. The group assures him that yes indeed, it's Wednesday. Additionally, the other man explains, that we all have to agree that it's Wednesday, otherwise there's gonna be chaos. Of course the first man did not imply that we wished it's another day of the week or that he is still gonna pretend it's not Wednesday. It did not hinder the other man to make sure that everything is clear - even if you feel like something else, you have to agree with everyone else in order to keep peace and organization. It might be exaggerated reference to Jantelagen (no one is special, no one should act like they are superior to one another). It is established that it's Wednesday, everyone has to adjust.And then it's my favourite scene with Charles XII. He, as a Swedish king, should be a clear indicator that Andersson tells something about Sweden. Okay, we have a king with absolute power, everyone serves him even if he has the most ridiculous demands. But... this could be any monarch, right? So for me by using him, the director was more about praising the modernization, understood both as moving from kingdoms to democracy and as equalization of the societies. Choosing Charles XII could simply just give Andersson space to mock king's homosexual needs, which was directly shown. Despite different possible interpretations, I admire Andersson for the technical management of this scene. It's the longest one in the movie and the most complicated. So many elements could go wrong and in the end there is this final version with no cut. Standing ovation.What if we look at Pigeon not as a portrait of Swedish life, but a life itself? All the feelings are phlegmatic. Even love, even anger, even laughter. Is the life so unfair or do we make it this way ourselves? I think that Swedish societ"" is just a frame. Andersson is using some obvious cliches and stereotypes (which still can be true!) about his motherland in order to explain something more, something common to all human beings. Or I'm just trying to find deeper meaning which really isn't there. If so, this is just another proof of this director's strength - his movies can be seen through so many shades of interpretation."
" The realistic isn't always real
",2017-12-06 00:00:00,1,"People have been duped into thinking that a film is realistic if each thing in it, taken by itself, is realistic. But the selection and assemblage into a whole is what makes a film, and Roy Andersson's selection is not a realistic look at life. It is a relentless montage of death and despair. Life is better than this.In context, it is just another dreary product of the post-modernist highbrow elite trying to convince the masses that their lives aren't worth living, in the hopes that they will destroy their culture so that they, the elite, can build a new utopia on its ashes.(Also, it's extremely boring. If Andersson had eliminated all of the disconnected scenes, including most of the ones at the start of the film, it would just be boring, which would be a great improvement.)"
" ""We want people to have fun.""
",2017-11-27 00:00:00,10,"Don't ask me why, it can't be explained, but I just love this flick. I found myself laughing irresistibly during any number of scenes because of the absurdist elements the director Roy Andersson decides to focus on. Along with the theme expressed in my summary line, which was a staple of the two novelty salesmen, a recurring thought throughout the film had various characters stating that they were 'happy to hear you're doing fine'. It was mentioned in various iterations a minimum of nine times by my count, even though we never get to see what the person on the other end of the line was supposed to be feeling fine about.What's clever are the scenes within scenes, as in the segment of an official looking gentleman missing an appointment while through the window of a cafe we see a distraught dance teacher reacting to her rejection by a male student, this a continuation of an earlier sequence. Andersson blends the surreal with the mundane in such a way that one can't help contemplate the absurdity of existence. How else to explain the drunken accordionist being refused entry to his own apartment until he sobers up? Without even checking the negative reviews on this board, I knew that there would be plenty of folks who wouldn't care for this picture, casting aside it's absurdist framework and failing to see the hysterical randomness of existence that the director chooses to portray. Personally, I wouldn't have even attempted to assign meaning to any of the scenes, but if you look up the comments of reviewer 'kboote', you may pick up some insights that you weren't even aware you had.When the film opened, it mentioned that this was the third part of a trilogy of movies, though that doesn't seem to be confirmed by anything on this site, or stated by Andersson in the brief bio page attached to this film. Perhaps one can make the case with some of the prior films he's directed, but not having seen them I can only speculate. But it wouldn't be a bad idea to get hold of them if they offer the same kind of illuminating and hysterical insight."
" More like Reflecting on Non-Existence
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,3,"The movie takes painstaking care to portray humanity at its worst. With thespian scenes, set camera and no movement, the unlucky viewer is led through a series of mostly disconnected tragedies of the mundane and less mundane life, with the actors generally mostly half-way to their grave both in agility and complexion. Lacking respect of death and the dying, death, greed, cruelty, slavery, torture, poverty, heart-break, loneliness, depression, suicide, war, grief. There is no character development, no hope, no love, no colour. In a regrettably dystopian image of a world, Andersson is treating the audience to misery and despair, without bothering with too much imagination. Attempts of understated comedian expression repeatedly fall flat. The end credits come as a relief from utter boredom."
" Huh?
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,5,"A Monty Python movie, without any of the irony or the humor. Reading the subtitles in a British accent actually enhances the experience. I'm proud to say, I did just that. The colors of the film are washed out and ugly, and so are all of the characters. Love it or hate it, it's purely original."
" Weird, static, oddly magnetic
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,5,"If you were to assume that a film with a title like tthis would be a bit weird, you wouldn't be disappointed upon actually watching it. 'A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence' consists entirely of grotesque, absurdist tableaux, all filmed from a distant, static camera so that one can hardly even see some of the details referred to by the script. And while some characters recur, there certainly isn't anything that could be described as a conventional plot. Oddly, the movie has a certain magnetic quality, and it's by no means as unwatchable as it should be by right. But it's still a deeply peculiar movie, and it's hard to conclude that director Roy Andersson made it for any reason other than that."
