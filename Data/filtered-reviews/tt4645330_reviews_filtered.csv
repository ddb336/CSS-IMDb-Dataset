" Thrilling courtroom drama
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,8,"The Holocaust denial historian David Irving is suing his American colleague Deborah E. Lipstadt, a Holocaust specialist. He did not accept that the latter accused him in a book of falsifying history. The trial, whose outcome is anything but obvious, is held in England. Frustrated at not being able to speak for herself, Deborah is well represented for all that by the lawyer Richard Rampton.Based on the transcripts of the Irving vs. Lipstadt trial that took place in London in 2000, Mick Jackson's film exudes authenticity. The question of Holocaust denial and how to combat it, which is at the heart of the debates, is posed with a commendable clarity that is never boring. The pace is lively and the suspense effective (which of the two enemies will win the battle is impossible to guess until the very last moment). The film is further vitalized by its trio of actors, fully invested in their roles: Rachel Weisz, a raging ball of nerves, Tom Wilkinson, calm and reassuring as the experienced lawyer he plays and the talented Timothy Spall (Peter Pettigrew, Voldemort's servant in ""Harry Potter""). He really looks the part, if there is such a thing. With all these virtues, ""Denial"" will please everyone, except the deniers!"
" Surprisingly effective courtroom drama
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,7,"An American academic (Rachel Weisz as Deborah Lipstadt) has to defend a libel (written defamation) suit in London - based on real events.Making an entertaining and authentic movie out of a 32-day libel trial in an English court (with no jury) is no mean feat: Denial delivers the goods, and there's very little wasted screen time. Much emotional impact is wrung from the fact that it's about the denial of the WWII holocaust by self-styled historian David Irving. The defence team has to prove Lipstadt's claim that he deliberately falsified his stories.Timothy Spall's performance of Irving is as unflattering as Scott's portrayal of Julius is flattering. I was a classmate of Anthony Julius (the lead solicitor, who gently but firmly educates Lipstadt in the mysteries of English law), and it's very strange watching a handsome, slim, sexy actor (Anthony Scott) doing an impression of somebody who would to have had a major makeover in the intervening 20 years to look like that! (Sorry, Tone!)Spall's Irving comes across as completely batty, rather than wicked, though Irving represents a tiny part of English society that is very real and very nasty. But hey, SPOILER - history is written by the winner.It's a slick, atmospheric, expensive movie, best watched with a good bottle of claret, probably. All that's missing is a bit at the end where it would say, ""Mishcon De Reya (Julius' law firm) - because you're worth it."""
" EXCELLENT FILM WITH GREAT ACTING and MESSAGE
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,10,"""Denial"" is based on the book ""History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier."" It is the story of Deborah E. Lipstadt (Rachel Weiss) and her legal battle in a libel trial brought by David Irving (Timothy Spall) a pathetic figure blind to how his racism and antisemitism corrupted his writings and beliefs. Deborah must prove that the historian lied with intention. Of course for any sane human being, it's beyond belief that a Holocaust denier could achieve even a modicum of attention or notoriety, much less have the audacity to bring suit against a scholar who simply published descriptions of that denier's own words. (Tom Wilkinson) is the outstanding, impressive barrister Richard Rampton who advocates for Ms. Lipstadt and Penguin Books. He must prove Irving was a racist, an Anti-Semite and knowingly misrepresented the facts in his works as a Holocaust denier. Though courtroom drama and corresponding legal work takes up much of the film, the most moving scene was the team's visit to Auschwitz. Heart and soul scenes that speak for themselves. This film is well-written, well-acted, directed and thought provoking. The court exchanges are acted out verbatim - as they actually happened. A reminder of how current society continues to struggle with such inexplicable thoughts."
" So fantastic
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,8,"This is a film based on a real case, focusing on the existence of the auschwitz massacre. It introduces the characteristics of the British legal trial in detail, and the debate in the trial is also very exciting. It is a good legal film, and more importantly, it shows the judicial justice.
Finally, the female professor won the lawsuit, she said with emotion; It turns out that the truth of history can be tried in court. She told survivors who came to find her. You have not been silenced in the court, but your voices have been heard all over the world by the verdict and in the annals of history."
" Worth it for the opposing side alone.
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,8,"I've been intrigued by this movie for many years but always forget to look it up. I found it on Hulu today and was impressed. My main morbid curiosity was watching a holocaust denier defend himself. As I expected, it was embarrassing, which is why he lost the case. He grasped at straws the whole time. I kept waiting to see how he'd crawl out of the hole he'd dig himself. The worst part was the footage of his speaking and people applauding his nonsense. The fact that multiple people like that exist is terrifying. I think people are being cruel to Weisz's performance. Her character was essentially silenced, and she owned every scene she was allowed to express emotion in. Another thing people aren't taking into account is this film was 1998ish. There's too much complaining about the dialogue (all taken verbatim by the way) the style, etc. it is true to the time. It does not take place in 2016. Maybe the most important lesson we learned about this movie is people need to pay better attention."
" Wonderful cast
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,8,Rachel Weisz always delightful to see her on the screen.
" Could have been a classic with better casting
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,6,"This is an ok film to watch though I'd expected more. Tom Wilkinson and Spall are great, however Rachel Weisz and andrew Scott are tragically bad and amateur."
" Worth the watch for the content
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,7,"Particularly interesting for the subject matter and an important piece of recent history. Though made in 2016, however, the movie views like it was filmed in the 90s, which is a bit weird, but perhaps intentional?"
" In denial, and that is final...
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,7,"Two neo-Nazis confront one another in a conversation midway through the 2001 film ""The Believer"": one denies the Holocaust happened, the other berates him and says '...of course it did - why else would there be a reason to idolise Hitler if he wasn't responsible for the deaths of all those Jews?' Well, why indeed? We know the Nazis hated Jews and Jewry, first through the words of Mein Kampf and then through the post-1933 actions of their government when the race was socially marginalised; taxed unfairly; boycotted and then eventually had synagogues and any real-estate either vandalised or confiscated. We know concentration camps existed, but that they were different places in 1944 compared to 1934. We know that Eastern Europe was once swimming with Jews, but that now the population of Israel alone is something like a mere eight million. Where did they all go?None of the above is, in essence, 'deniable' - we are aware it physically happened and in a very particular order, but what does any of it necessarily say about the fact there were/were not gas chambers at Auschwitz? 'At Auschwitz...' Raul Hilberg once said '...history was destroyed at the same time history was made'. Indeed, and the whole thing is still rumbling on - still creating its own kind of history - in the twenty-first century.If the Second World War was fought on the grounds that Europe, even the world, was to be saved from Fascism, a constituent part of which is the removing of one's right to an opinion, should it not therefore be acceptable to allow one to one's opinion that certain elements of Holocaust are spurious? ""Denial"" is the taut drama, more a legal thriller, about the true-to-life case of British historian David Irving (Timothy Spall) taking the Jewish-American academic Deborah Lipstadt (Rachel Weisz) to court in 1996 on grounds of libel, a case which lasted for four years. It is something which eventually seems to spill out into a wider discussion on the holocaust's authenticity, when the matter is actually as to whether Lipstadt is right that Irving 'misinterprets evidence' and whether a gas fuelled genocide occurred at Auschwitz at all.The film certainly presents itself early on as a piece depicting a battle of wits between the aforementioned two - deliberately introducing them doing the same thing, public speaking, with Irving cracking jokes to affluent elderly men somewhere after a dinner and Lipstadt giving a passionate talk on the issue of Holocaust Studies in her day job as a teacher. A few scenes later, the two of them clash within the confines of this very kind of venue as Lipstadt is giving a lecture; Irving interrupts and crisply rebuts her 'facts', even embarrassing her, but then resorts to shouting and is eventually escorted out looking like a bit of a crank. Determined not to let that be the end of it, Lipstadt is informed of the aforementioned libel case against her and battle appears to commence.Despite this early pretext, what comes to transpire is Weisz's character essentially being depicted battling her male dominated legal team more than anything else, which occurs when they persistently advise her not to take the stand so as to allow the men to do the work. There is one woman in the team, however, but she's very young and it's her first time... Best to just let the men take care of it. I was struck, thus, by how strangely passive Lipstadt becomes in what seemed to be her own story as people do the work around her.Despite being part-produced by the 'impartial' BBC (the basis for many of the film's incidental scenes often seem to lie in a 2000 interview with Irving on the BBC's ""Hardtalk"" programme), the film goes to some length to depict Irving as merely a bit strange: the way he feeds jelly babies to his daughter; the way he gazes out of a rain soaked window; his raft of hand-written journals that line his shelves, somewhat of a iconographical trope in the thriller genre of the mentally disturbed. But is it really so wise, despite the subject-matter, to suggest that the audience take sides?One has to stress that there have existed instances of holocaust fabrication: memoirs written by people who actually spent the war in Switzerland; massacres in Polish towns attributed to the Nazis when, in actual fact, the USSR were responsible. Perhaps frustratingly, very little of this seems to infiltrate the film's universe. One must appreciate it is bound to depicting actual events and real people, but it struck me as an opportunity lost to be a little more daring. Irrespective, ""Denial"" offers much to get one's teeth into; knowing about as much as I did about the case, which was very little, going into the film no doubt enhanced the experience, a viewing experience I recommend."
" Quite moving and well done. Filmed on location at Auschwitz.
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,5,"Discussing the Holocaust and its deniers often requires a blunt object. The movie summarizes his personality and the arguments nicely.
Most of the cast have a personal connection to the Holocaust. Rachel Weisz's family immigrated in the 1930s to the UK. She portrays Deborah Lipstadt - born in Queens, studied in Israel and visiting Jewish communities in the Soviet Union. (She was arrested by the KGB on one trip). Apparently ""Bleeker Street"" Productions is behind this film. (Yes that's a spoof of Baker Street,) Bleeker Street created well regarded BBC shows like Sherlock. That show seems to supply most of the actors and a writer or two.
Consider the Bleeker Street stand outs and their real life counterparts:
John Sessions as Professor Richard Evans. His testimony was clinical, exhaustive and brutal. His professional findings were printed for the public. As depicted in the film, Prof. Evans, along with the defense counsel, Richard Rampton (played by the impressive Tom Wilkinson) were openly confrontational. Both men constantly interrupted Irving. But unlike Rampton, Evans considers German his second language. Evans lectures in German and his grad students all speak fluent German. And from what I know the men generally disliked each other. According to one interview I read, Evans once invited Irving to a dinner party. Mrs. Evans asked her husband to never invited Irving back.. Andrew Scott, Sherlock's nemesis, Moriarty, portrayal of Anthony Julius was excellent. I believe Scott's role was the first time I've seen him play a good guy. Sherlock co-creator Mark Gatiss plays another expert witness, the Dutch professor Jan van Pelt. His material was used by PBS Nova Holocaust on Trial. Gatiss' testimony about the wire pillars - was a key point in the 1988 Hermann Wouk's historical miniseries WAR & REMEMBERANCE.
And an honorable mention of a solid BBC dramatic actor: Alex Jennings as the judge, Mr. Justice Grey. Jennings' first big role came apparently in 1982's SMILEY's PEOPLE. He was a police constable who got sick at a crime scene. Jenning's part is ironic given that his portrayal of Justice Grey is as a ""sphinx' and inscrutably fair. According to the trial transcript, Grey's behavior relaxed Irving. He then gave himself ""enough rope"" so to speak."
" Absolutely Superb - Watch It And Judge For Yourself.....
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,9,"Very well written and executed account of David Irving's unsuccessful libel action against Deborah Lipstadt and Penguin books. All the more so for the fact that the court exchanges are acted out verbatim - as they actually happened.Well presented, dramatic and thought-provoking. I could go on at length - as some reviewers, especially the more negative ones, have done - on detailed aspects of this film but would urge anyone reading this to just watch it and judge it for themselves."
" Some People...
",2019-09-05 00:00:00,8,"Denial is a very nice little courtroom drama with a big impact. The performances are top notch, especially the acting vets Tom Wilkinson and Timothy Spall. The director lets the story make the impact, instead of style. It's hard to believe there are people in this world that have beliefs like these. The only thing I can say bad about it, is I wish there was more of the case which was always the most interesting part of the film. I could have watched the whole case unfold and been completely tuned in. I think there is only four or so scenes of the actual case. An underdog for holocaust movies with emotionally haunting scenes and one for the strong willed, who decide to stand for what is right.

" Enjoyable, but caught between two stools
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,5,"Is this about a libel trail in which David Irving is the plaintiff and Penguin Books Limited and Deborah E. Lipstadt are the defendants? Or is it about someone who is unfamiliar with a foreign legal system, who has to surrender to the better judgement of her legal advisers?Really, it seems to be a bit of both. The title of the film seems to refer not only to the ""denial of the Holocaust"", but also to Ms Lipstadt being denied her day(s) in court, since the legal advice she receives it that her appearance would be counterproductive.This film could have been much better if it had stuck to being one thing or the other; and if it had cast an American as Ms Lipstadt, rather than a Briton putting on a fake American accent."
" Slow and tedious
",2019-05-07 00:00:00,5,Not much of a story here. We've heard it all before and ultimately David Irving gets his just desserts. Tim Spall poorly cast as is Rachel Weiss so I was disappointed in both performances although that's more the fault of the casting agency and scriptwriters.A bit pointless really and revisiting this aspect of WW2 doesn't take us anywhere in my opinion
" A very biased move
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,3,"I watched the movie Denial on SBS, the producers had gotten the most surliest evil looking character to play the part of David Irving. And the most beautiful actress to play the part of Deborah E. Lipstadt. Such a biased movie. Actually David Irving is a very handsome gentleman with a great sense of humour"
" Taking From the Pages of History?
",2019-04-09 00:00:00,9,"Denial is a wonderful movie adaption of a gripping true story. Though a couple of decades old now, in an era of officially sanctioned ""alternative"" facts and liberally pedalled untruths, its story resonates just as forcefully now, as it did at the outcome of the trial which is the central focus of the narrative.The performances are uniformally excellent, especially those of the four leading characters. The very under-rated Rachel Weisz plays American author and historian Deborah Lipstadt upon whose part biographical book, the film is based. Her publishing company Penguin Books is sued for libel in the UK, by the self-styled and self-promoting David Irving, a so-called expert historian on Nazi German history. Timothy Spall plays the oily Irving, with just the right mix of reptilian fascination. Lipstadt, deciding to defend the case in London hires a legal team led by solicitor Anthony Julius and barrister Richard Rampton, which must prove that Irving had lied about the Holocaust to win the case. Tom Wilkinson is outstandingly good, as Rampton, reputed to be at the time, one of the best legal minds in Britain, an accolade we later learn he earned with good reason. Anthony Scott, whose work is mostly seen in the film's first half provides plenty of that quietly self-deprecating, understated humour for which the Brits are well-known and which adds just the right dash of comic relief to proceedings, which frequently cover exceedingly grim territory.Besides unveiling the overarching true contest about what constitutes true history and what is false and confronting issues of racism and anti-Semitism, Denial fascinates, with its detailing of the defence's trial strategy, with which for much of the lead-up to and trial itself, Lipstadt didn't necessarily agree. Ultimately she puts her faith in her legal team and is rewarded in a genuinely moving climax.Director Mick Jackson, whose cinema work I haven't seen for many a day, handles the production, like the defence team itself, in a smartly proficient, non-flashy manner. This is especially noticeable when the defence team tour the skeletal remains of the Auschwitz death camp in Poland, seeking to find weaknesses in Irving's historical accounts of Nazi actions. The temptation to recreate large-scale scenes of human horror are strongly controlled and only briefly hinted at.Denial is that rare cinematic beast. It's about as close as you'll come to getting a dramatised true story, without it falling into the documentary genre. Indeed much of the dialogue during the compelling trial scenes of the second half is taken directly from the courtroom records. I have to admit to some surprise that Denial didn't have a greater impact at some of the high profile awards ceremonies."
" Harrowing true story interwoven with Courtroom drama
",2019-03-28 00:00:00,6,"The often harrowing true story of a 2000 libel trial in the UK where the defence legal team had in essence to prove the Nazi Holocaust in World War II happened.The trial is between a renowned U.S. academic Deborah Lipstadt (Rachel Weisz) and Holocaust denier David Irving (Timothy Spall).
The casting of such a harrowing screenplay is excellent. Both Weisz and Spall give excellent performances ably assisted by a supporting cast including Tom Wilkinson and Andrew Scott.The film I'm sure hits more of a raw nerve amongst the Jewish population as they were the victims of the Holocaust.I must admit I had never even contemplated the term Holocaust denier before. The evidence of the trial rightly puts Irving in his place thankfully.I like courtroom drama and this film has loads of it. The peculiarities of the U.K. legal system compared to the U.S. counterparts are shown etc.There are moving scenes of the cast visiting the remains of Auschwitz concentration camp.
The subject matter is heavy going at times and that very point is put to the judge in deciding to dispense with a jury trial. It is definitely a film of historic importance more than 'entertainment' one would normally watch a film for.I have been impressed with Rachel Weisz in three films recently. The Favourite, Disobedience and this.
Spall has evolved such a lot from his bit part Brummie in the early 1980s U.K. TV show 'Auf Wiedersehn Pet'.The screenplay by British playwright David Hare is the film's strong point bringing such harrowing subject matter to the screen."
" The voice of suffering must be heard
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,8,"There's something that feels packaged and glossy here, and maybe a little bit off with Rachel Weisz's character (not sure if it's the role or the performance), but the subject matter, the true story of a libel suit brought by Holocaust denier David Irving against historian Deborah Lipstadt is compelling, poignant, and raises important questions. How does one respond to someone whose views are so distorted, whose mind is filled with racist filth, and who spews outrageous lies which stir up rage in both those who believe him and those who are horrified by him? Someone who is so far outside the norm that to engage him is to help mainstream him, but to be silent is to let his views go unchallenged and uncorrected? Someone who will quickly drag you down into the gutter he's in if you're not very careful? These are the questions Lipstadt and her legal team wrestle with, and as they're complicated and universal, I found great depth in this part of the drama.There is a parallel here to demagogues like Trump, and we see the most important thing we must hold on to - regardless of our political or religious viewpoints - is the truth. We must have truth, not ""alternative facts"", propaganda, or a re-writing of history which dishonors millions and is morally wrong. It's all the more important for monstrous events in history, the crimes against humanity such as the Holocaust. The voice of suffering must be heard, to paraphrase the film.It's in the clear-eyed, sober pursuit of truth by the barrister played by Tom Wilkinson, and in the scenes at Auschwitz, that the film is at its strongest. And as Lipstadt/Weisz puts it, ""Freedom of speech means you can say whatever you want. What you can't do is lie and expect not to be held accountable for it."" The film stirs up a proper amount of outrage, and for me had real tension. If you'd like a little extra helping of outrage and sadness, just read a selection of the low rating reviews out on IMDb, which seems to be a haven for the alt-right to attack films like this, or those starring or directed by African-Americans. I'm not saying if you didn't like the film you're in this group, but my god, reading some of those reviews is depressing."
" Good Enough
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,7,"I think Timothy Spall portrayed Irving superbly well.
This movie good enough"
" Close, but No Cigar: Denial
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,5,"This film had great potential. I've seen practically Holocaust film ever made, and three courtroom dramas on the Holocaust; Nuremberg 1960, Nuremberg (recent), and The Eichmann Trial. All of them were better than this one. Why? They had more authenticity and more likable protagonists. The only person believable in this film is the villain, Irving. He actually believes he is not a racist and anti-semite. He is extremely erudite, and despite his brilliance, is still a nazi. The woman who opposes him, Weitz, is just too whiny to be likable. Her annoying concern about people actually doubting the Holocaust ever existed is completely ridiculous. How could anyone forget it with the constant flow of Holocaust films that come out of Hollywood? The best of these, in my opinion, other than Schindler's List, is The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. I hated Life is Beautiful (because it wasn't for the people in the camps). Even Seven Beauties was better than this weak entry. Not recommended."
" Why does it keep raining until the final verdict?
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,6,"A sadly bland and pathos laden attempt at portraying the importance of historiography. Although revisionist bigots deserve all they get this film does nothing for the British legal system, Rachel's career or international opinions of the British.
This film should've been a much more in depth ans serious investigation."
" Biased movie
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,2,"Could not watch this movie without the constant feeling that I was being brainwashed.
It actually achieved exactly the opposite effect on me that it probably intended.... that is a sign that it is also a bad movie.
The historical facts ares much more complex than completely demonizing Hitler and the nazis, and it is difficult not to see this film a sample of propaganda. Spielberg was involved in the financing of the trial.... it is difficult not to see Hollywood financing this movie and the reasons for doing so.Not only Jews died in concentration camps, a significant number were not Jews, but there are no movies for them."
" A first-rate legal drama
",2018-11-09 00:00:00,9,"I recommend this movie for people who, like me, make time for conspiracy theories despite loathing them. Outside of the interesting ""intentionalist versus functionalist"" debate, ""revisionism"" erroneously connotes academic legitimacy. The title is therefore apt.All the dialogue pertaining to the defense's fascinating legal strategy went over very well with me. That and the much appreciated verbatim courtroom dialogue comprises most of the script. My positive impressions were reinforced by subsequent research into the trial. Denial delves into the sinister practice of Holocaust denialism at its best. I stretched my viewing over several hours and basked in the cerebral delight of it.Rachel Weisz has been given flak for a performance that did not leave me in want of anything. Though I would not say it was an award-worthy performance, I chalk that up more to the formulaic production than any shortcoming of hers. Tom Wilkinson deserves mention as her character's barrister. Timothy Spall is terrific as David Irving!This glowing review notwithstanding, Denial has the feel of excellent television, which is no way to compliment a feature film. The defense's true-to-life legal strategy necessarily undercut the film's emotive power. The scenes at Auschwitz itself are therefore especially vital to its success for me. Including London's Boadicea and Her Daughters was a nice touch."
" David and Goliath, if Goliath Rightly Won
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,6,"Based on Deborah Lipstadt's perspective of the trial where she, a Holocaust historian and professor, was sued for libel by Holocaust denier David Irving, ""Denial"" saves most of the melodramatic moments for outside the courtroom, as she argues with her lawyers over legal strategies and as Irving plays to the press and public and later has an egg thrown at him, while the trial itself is a rather dry presentation of evidence. It's an appropriate, if not necessarily entertaining, approach to a based-on-a-true-story defense of academia and facts. Released during the 2016 presidential campaign in the United States, the movie's portrayal of Irving invites easy parallels to be made with now-President Donald Trump's disregard for facts and dissemination of conspiracy theories and misinformation, whereby ""Denial,"" thusly, becomes a kind of catharsis or wish fulfillment for the election's losing side.I don't think the comparison goes much further than that, though. Perhaps, even, Irving may be seen as a somewhat sympathetic, or at least pathetic, character, which seems unfortunate for a movie that visits Auschwitz and portrays a Holocaust survivor. He's an anti-Semitic buffoon with a fragile ego, but he's right, in a sense, that he's the David up against the Goliath in this dramatized contest. There's a reason that most courtroom dramas are from the perspective of the underdog. It's less compelling to root for the side with plenty of resources, a team of skilled lawyers and, to top it off, academia and facts in their favor. It lacks obstacles. Meanwhile, Irving has no one and represents himself at trial. If like me, you don't seek cinema merely to reflect your own judgments, ""Denial,"" if not seen through the lenses of contemporary politics or an interest in racist conspiracy theories as controversy, has the unpleasant appearance of the flogging of a dead horse."
" Propaganda piece ... too bad.
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,1,"I don't necessarily agree with the views on either side of the true-story here .. but this movie being more propaganda than true-story/drama made it unwatchable for me 20 minutes in. If they had made this more true to life it could have been a great film. Instead they made the author a goofy-looking, bumbling idiot (which he is not) and the leading character an attractive heroine ... obviously intended to shape people's opinions of the story and people involved. Too bad."
" Smells of BBC
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,3,"I wanted to like this movie but it reeks of BBC involvement and I mean that in a pejorative manner.Timothy Thrall is a fine actor and he garnered a great deal of attention for his role as Irving. But I think that his casting was unfortunate.Why?Because David Irving was (and is) a quite handsome man and Thrall looks like a Scrooge. One bad casting ruined the entire film for me. Thrall with his jowls and corners of his mouth turned down, looking confused - that's not Irving.Knowing the verdict of the trial beforehand makes the highlight of the film rather dim. Maybe if one has no knowledge of the trial or of Irving the film will be more of a surprise.Three stars."
" A highly satisfying viewing experience.
",2018-07-11 00:00:00,8,"An extremely well executed drama, without a single pointless or wasted scene. No part of this production drew attention away from the story - which was focused on with laser intensity - so although the cinematography was excellent and atmospheric, there was no flashy camerawork or eye-catching visuals; nor did the music ever overwhelm the dialogue or leave you humming a prominent leitmotif; and the editing was crisp, straightforward, and business-like.The performances were uniformly exquisite, with each actor playing their role with subtlety, nuance, and verisimilitude. There were plenty of opportunities for hammy moments, but to their credit, and the credit of the director, each actor played their part with skilful restraint. In the more emotional scenes, their passions seethed mostly beneath the surface, which all added to the emotional investment of the viewer, forced on occasion to experience the enormity of events far more than if everything had been done for them by the actors. This is a sign of truly skilful and confident directing, as well as a rare example of a modern movie trusting its audience to think and feel what they are meant to, without leading them round by the nose.Overall, this was a thoroughly satisfying viewing experience, that left just the right cocktail of aftertastes on the intellectual/emotional palate.From the number of negative reviews of this film, and its low IMDB rating, I can only conclude that there are still a worrying number of anti-Semites and holocaust deniers out there, as there is very little in it to complain about technically or creatively."
" An interesting story poorly told
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,4,"Neither the script nor Weisz convince in this disappointing superficial and artificial take on the David Irving libel case. Timothy Spall, however, is on fine form."
" History In The Courtroom
",2018-07-07 00:00:00,6,"It's strange to say this, but ""Denial"" is Timothy Spall's movie. Strange because the movie is based a book by American historian Deborah Lipstadt on the libel trial launched by British amateur historian David Irving against herself and Penguin Books. Irving was played by Spall. The trial was launched because Irving claimed that Lipstadt had libelled him in a book she had written. Irving was a Holocaust denier, and Lipstadt a Jewish academic who specialized in the Holocaust. Given that the movie is based on Lipstadt's book you expect her to be the focal point, but Irving - in spite of his noxious anti-semitic views - was really the more compelling character, largely because of how well Spall did with the part. Rachel Weisz took on the part of Lipstadt. She was fine in the role, but outshone by Spall.After an opening encounter between the two in Atlanta, where Lipstadt was speaking, most of the movie is set in a British courtroom. You do learn some of the finer points in British law - such as that in the UK it's the defendant in a libel trial that has to prove the case. Irving launched the case in the UK for that very reason. You also see in Lipstadt just a wee bit of the ""ugly American"" from time to time - such as her refusal to bow to the judge when her trial begins, because- as she said - ""I'm an American."" Maybe - but too bad. You're in a British court! (She did bow to the judge eventually.) There are some ugly anti-semitic demonstrations portrayed outside the courtroom.The presentation of the case by Lipstadt's legal team is fairly dry and technical. It's interesting from a historical perspective - but you really have to have an interest in history to appreciate some of the finer points. I do have a Bachelors degree in history, so found it interesting to watch as Lipstadt's legal team and various witnesses pull Irving's views apart. But I would say that overall the movie isn't especially engrossing. It's a good movie. It's an important subject. Even aside from the Holocaust, it does deal with the question of when and whether there should be limits on freedom of speech. It's certainly worth watching, but it's certainly not an American-style courtroom drama filled with suspense. (6/10)"
" 6/10
",2018-06-20 00:00:00,6,"Denial didn't really keep my attention.It ended up being a court case about a difference in opinion.
It was also very heavy-handed in what it wanted you to feel about the holocaust, as if you actually had to emphasise who's side you should be on during the movie.Round this off with a terrible performance/accent off Rachel Weisz in the lead role and the bland brown/grey of the whole movie and I'm not rushing back to watch this any time soon."
" Holocaust denial is crap and every opportunity to call it so should be encouraged.
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,7,"This is not an easy watch by any means. Timothy Spall is fantastic and plays the denial character well. So well in fact, despite that I love him as an actor, I hate him in this. Truth is of course my feelings are really directed at the real life character he portrays, David Irving and any other holocaust denier for that matter. That this is a true story is most detestable of all. There's an undercurrent to this story though, away from the matter of the holocaust. It's that of the law, the way it works and the way people can work within it. How it can be used to protect racist, antisemitic people. How the simple right and wrong of the court is hard to equate in the real world and how the those wishing to justify their crimes use it, bend it and twist it for their defence. That the law protects everyone, even evil and unapologetically stupid people like David Irving and people like him. Freedom of speech is not freedom to lie. As a film, this is good, solidly acted, Tom Wilkinson being the stand out for me, but it could've been a little better, less glossy perhaps with such an important subject. Still, I'm very pleased that this story was brought to the screen. Holocaust denial is crap and every opportunity to call it so should be encouraged."
" Excellent Courtroom Drama
",2018-04-25 00:00:00,9,The logic & dialogue of the script was Supurb. Acting & Casting were Perfect. The Story True & Realistict.
" Guilty!
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,2,"What a horribly miscast, pandering, less-than- lifetime-quality mess of a movie. 
RW is so awful in this film, and the directing so poor, I don't think anyone could have brought any dignity or believability to this mess. 
This obnoxious, self-righteous, narcissistic woman who's ""from queens"" (just when you thought the film couldn't get any worse, this line rears it's ugly head) Is such a horrible stereotype that she should be on trial herself. 
The survivors deserve better and so do the filmgoers. 
Now I just have to deny that this movie ever existed."
" Denial - Reminds Us of an Unforgivable Time
",2018-03-30 00:00:00,8,"Denial is professional to the eye with strong performances and some good dialog but, why is it shows on this topic can too often leave me feeling I'm being unnecessarily manipulated? I.E.; the casting of suss looking actors for the 'bad' guys - with too many snide characteristics to make sure we get that this is a 'bad' guy - then at times, with too many 'there, I told you so' situations on the side of the 'good' guys. This can be undermining and should not be necessary as a device to influence us regarding the already terrible incidents most of us are already on-side with. Shocking crimes were committed by Nazi Germany and these cannot be denied but, these were also administered to numerous victims of all races - not just those being examined in many movies with this theme. Make no mistake, Denial is a fine movie and apart from the odd single-sided issues, it's a story that deserves to be told. Perhaps one problem could be that some original issues are being dealt with too long after the fact and, often by countries that did not do enough when these atrocities were being committed. France (among others!) has much to atone for by betraying many innocent bystanders. Any justice is good but late justice is not always good enough. As for the doubters, Eisenhower's prolific camp liberation footage is enough to confirm what was happening at these sites. If in any doubt, take a look!
Visually, this particular movie is a strong production dealing with a contemporary, factual court case and should please viewers with an interest in justice and history."
" Those Who Control History Control the Future: Holocaust Denial Put on Trial
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,10,"""Denial"" centers on a Hitler ""scholar"", David Irving, a British author who has consistently denied the Holocaust, and his lawsuit against American historian Deborah Lipstadt. To be fair, Irving was among several scholars who refuted the authenticity of the so-called ""Hitler Diaries"" which were revealed by the German periodical ""Stern"" in the early 1980's. While Irving has brought to light many interesting facts about the Nazis and Adolph Hitler, he has repeatedly stated in his books he doesn't believe the Holocaust occurred on the widespread scale which has near unanimous acceptance among mainstream historians, particularly because of surviving prisoners and film footage. (The Nazis had destroyed many of their facilities to cover up the Holocaust.) Lipstadt published a book ""Denying the Holocaust"" in which she refers to how Irving and other deniers misrepresent history and facts to perpetuate their erroneous conclusions about the Holocaust.The trouble is, Irving wants it both ways. He wants to deny the Holocaust and yet be recognized as legitimate by other scholars and historians. In short, he wants the keys to the academic washroom. He brought the lawsuit against Lipstadt because, in some sense, her books which refer to his denial of the Holocaust as bogus history was denying him the keys to the washroom. Lipstadt is a bona fide and recognized scholar, and her criticisms of Irving deny him entry into the exclusive club of scholar-historians. The film is about Irving's attempt to debunk the criticisms of a fellow scholar and in some sense legitimize a debate about whether or not the Nazis systematically gassed Jews and other minorities labeled as ""degenerate"" by the German government in the late 1930's and 1940's.Timothy Spall in an Academy-Award caliber performance plays David Irving, author and Holocaust denier who sues Deborah Lipstadt (Rachel Weisz). Tom Wilkinson is convincing as Lipstadt's British libel lawyer. The film begins at a lecture concerning the Holocaust offered by Lipstadt, and Irving interrupts the proceedings, claiming he has filed a lawsuit against the speaker. Instead of settling out of court, Lipstadt resolves to defend herself. She hires a law firm whose cracker jack defense attorney is Richard Rampton (Wilkinson). To prepare, they not only visit one of the Auschwitz camp sites but painstakingly go through Irving's books to see if he uses propaganda and deception to further his assertions that the Holocaust as portrayed by history is a fallacy.An horrific episode in the annals of human history involved Germany whose government was controlled by right-wing radicals, the National Socialist German Workers' Party, better known as the Nazi Party, and their supreme leader, Adolph Hitler. The Nazis with Hitler at the helm instigated what is known as the ""Final Solution to the Jewish Problem"", a systematic extermination of Jews and those of Jewish heritage, defined as individuals having at least one (or more) Jewish grandparent or closer. Millions of Jews and other ethnicities such as Gypsies, Poles and other Eastern Europeans were forced into concentration camps where many gassed or suffered other heinous indignations. At the same time, Germany was fighting the Western Allies in the Second World War. When the war ended, many of the camps were liberated, such as those collectively called Auschwitz, and the prisoners told horrific stories of unimaginable torture and execution.Over the many decades since the end of the Second World War, there have been a small but vocal group of so-called ""historians"" who have tried to tell and sell a different picture of the war. They claim the interment and execution of Jews and other ethnicities by the Nazis, called ""The Holocaust"", did not actually happen. They agree that inmates were interred in camps, but their captivity was intended for expulsion, not for extermination. They refer to the accepted fact of the Holocaust as a large propaganda hoax perpetrated by Jews. (Sound familiar?)History is not always a pretty picture. But if we deny history, especially the horrific episodes, we deny who we are today and who we can become. While the real Lipstadt did not agree with Germany's government desiring to put Irving in jail for 3 years for denying the Holocaust, it is extremely important that we understand real history to the best of our abilities. We can help prevent a holocaust from occurring in the future only if we acknowledge the reasons for holocausts of the past, which entail knowing and understanding how and why they happened. It is interesting that the Jewish Holocaust and Holocaust Denial seem to have common enemies: Jews. Just about all Holocaust Deniers are Anti-Sematic. Is this a coincidence?"
" A very good and interesting movie
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,9,"Unfortunately, some of the highlighted reviews in this page were obviously made by Nazi sympathizers. Do not take their low rated reviews seriously and watch this important movie. And Imdb should use more scrutiny when they allow a horrid and insulting review to be a top review."
" I liked it!
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,8,"I thought the film was extremely well written and acted brilliantly by all of the five main players. In fact Spall was outstanding.
In the hands of another director or producer, the film could have easily significantly longer. More time telling the story of the Holocaust, a longer build up before the trial and so on. However, it cut to the chase, made a point and moved on. Each character was developed sufficiently to understand their individual role in the piece. The law including the burden of proof, was made easily digestible for non lawyers. Over all the film was lean and got on with telling this particle story and I like that. I own this film on DVD and will watch it again.
I do not understand some of the negative reviews posted here.
This film deserved to have done far better at the box office. Quite what the problem was I am uncertain, perhaps the absence of any really big names (no offence Rachel, you played the role wonderfully, to a tee) or whether the cinema going public just does not want to see any more Holocaust related productions. If the latter, that would be sad because this film is blessed with layers and is about so much more than the Holocaust.
Oh well, Blade Runner bombed on it's first run in the cinemas 35 years ago, so maybe all is not lost!"
" Should have been better with such actors, but still good
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,7,"I thought that any film with Weisz, Wilkinson, Spall and Scott in it would be worth the maximum score or thereabouts for me but somehow Denial, despite its subject matter being something I view as important, missed the target.The acting was superb. Andrew Scott especially so. I've met a few lawyers in my time and of a type, Scott's Julius rang so very true. So many of the occupants of the Inns of Court are admirable but weird that all Scott had to do for the characterisation was to walk around one for a while.In the same manner Wilkinson hit the self confident and rather superior barrister spot on. There was a certain conceit that was delightfully communicated. Spall all but turned Irvine into a grotesque and in real life the opposite is true, and part of Irvine's weaponry. He's not hesitant but personable, believable and convincing, that is if you don't know the facts. To paint him as an unattractive failure gives the wrong message. There were glimpses of Irvine's way with words, but not enough. He ended up as someone almost pitiable when in fact he's dangerous. Weisz is such a good actress that one must consider that she was obliged to turn Lipstadt into such an unattractive character. I ended up not liking her. (Sorry to the real Lipstadt, I'm sure you are a lovely person who is sympathetic to the needs and desires of others.) I know that feminism rules, but lawyering is complex and the suggestion that the team listened to her for tactics seemed rather unbelievable. I'm not sure that holocaust denial should be an offence. All aspects of history have their contrarians, not to mention those who twist facts to suit their political prejudices, so making a special case, albeit out of something that is rather special, out of holocaust denial is questionable. Perhaps not in Germany as I can see why they feel the option is the better one.The libel laws in the UK seem to be merely a method of enriching the lawyers, but then the systems in the USA have the same emphasis so why make it into a big thing?Using dialogue from the court records is a cop out. It is normally boring, repetitive and vague. Did anyone believe that A Few Good Men showed how a court ran?We should not forget the horrors of the extermination camps but, unfortunately, we will. It will be a footnote in history in a few years. There was a better film to make on the subject, and with such a front row perhaps should have been made.So much for the negatives: the film is still well worth watching, if only for Scott, and is worth the cost of the DVD, but one can't help but regret the much better film that was missed. The Auschwitz scenes were well done although it would be hard not to make them heartrending and emotional. There were certain aspects that were important for the plot and these were rather laboriously covered, but then, I suppose, we'd moan if they had not been mentioned. All in all 7 is a little harsh, but 8 is beyond reach."
" compelling headline drama
",2017-10-17 00:00:00,7,"Deborah Lipstadt (Rachel Weisz) is a Jewish history writer. She refuses to debate holocaust denier David Irving (Timothy Spall) but he continues to confront her. In her latest book, she ridicules him and he sues her in London for defamation. To her shock, the burden of proof is on her. She hires Princess Di's lawyer Anthony Julius (Andrew Scott). She goes to Auschwitz with lawyer Richard Rampton (Tom Wilkinson). There are limitations to making this history come to life. This is surprisingly compelling considering that it's a stodgy court drama. It's able to bring some interesting FACTS to light. When Julius forbids survivors from testifying, I wonder if they would climax with the expected testimonies. In fact, I wonder if Lipstadt would be beaten up by neo-Nazis in a darken alley to amp up the climax. It doesn't do any of that. There is a limited climax and some tension throughout. The weight of history is quite heavy but the historical outcome is not much in doubt."
" a attempt to treat some extremely important questions
",2017-10-13 00:00:00,8,"The actors are obviously outstanding, the script staggers at some parts, and yes , is artificial at others, but the movie raises an extremely important question, particularly poignant at our troubled times - what is the truth? can history be manipulated? is it OK to express your racist views, because of the freedom of speech? and what is the current duty of historians if not to prevent the abuse and intentional juggling of History? Or should the conspiracy partisans be ignored? Hard questions, extremely difficult to answer. No, the movie is not brilliant answering them, but is it brilliant because it raises the point and shows at least some complexity and seriousness of the questions of truth..."
" It does not become a great movie
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,5,"It's a movie you see, because these types of movies always like to watch them, but it does not come at any time to be a good movie, even if it's not bad.The first problem I encounter is that Timothy Spall did not believe me, it's like a caricature and that leaves him credible. Otherwise, the rest of the actors are fine.It is not a good movie of judgments and there are times when it is thick. There are times when you do not know where you are going.I think the visit to the concentration camp is just to create sentimentality.The photograph has good moments, has moments in which it is very beautiful and transmits, but then when it illuminates through a window, it puts too much light and it spoils it.the director is normal, does not make nice plans or narrates but at least not bored.It is a movie that if it did not have these actors, would go unnoticed"
" A good and very important movie for our time
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,10,"All actors deliver a good performance, especially Tom Wilkinson is standing out, who made a big impression on me in the past already. He displays a wide variety of emotions and has a remarkable and intense presence on the screen.Timothy Spall accurately portrays David Irving, a human being who out of vanity and sheer craving for recognition is pretty much indifferent to the question if the applause so desired by him comes from the wrong direction.The scene in Auschwitz I found too long and expendable. People standing on rubble did not convey the emotional impact to me that it tried to. And in principle we all know what Auschwitz was like and know the emotional implication.For people like me who are interested in the subject this court room drama can feel like a thriller by times, especially the verbal duels between Richard Rampton and David Irving. The discourse about the gas chambers shows how many claims of the deniers of the Shoah are not really thought out and are ultimately inconsistent with the state of evidence.The movie is of great importance especially today, for we are living in an age of relativism, sometimes even called the ""post-fact"" era. Shermer and Grobman have a good chapter in their book ""Denying History"", which demonstrates how in the science of history the pendulum swung into the opposite direction in a counter reaction to the (not accurate) convictions of the 19th century – we can describe everything in history objectively and comprehensively – and it did this in an excessively strong way. And how this could explain the emergence of phenomena like the denial of the Shoah.The movie can serve as a starting point for anyone interested in the topic, with the movie pointing to the very extensive verdict of the judge. Furthermore the expert witnesses Richard Evans and Robert van Pelt appear in the movie, each one of them has written a very good and well documented book about his findings in the trial.That means that thanks to the trial Irvings lying is thoroughly documented now. That is the reason why the historian Evans could give his book the title ""Lying about Hitler"" – because Irving actually IS a liar, and it is documented beyond any doubt now. It is not ""Hollywood"" or this movie which tries to ""discredit"" Irving. Irving discredited himself with his lying, everyone can see this today just by comparing the historical sources with Irving's works.Furthermore as the movie correctly addresses it is Irving who attacked free speech. Had he won his libel trial every publishing company and author would have to think twice if they ever say anything critical of a denier of the Shoah anymore. This fact is often missed or even distorted into the opposite.Some people coming here seem to feel the urge to try to push their ideologically driven agenda by voting this movie down and any positive review of it. My message to them would be: sorry guys, but history is not determined by voting. Not on a movie database website. Not at all.Because of the major importance of this movie I'm giving it 10 stars."
" Somewhat of a disappointment
",2017-09-08 00:00:00,5,"A British neo-Nazi sues an American Jewish writer for defamation, in a UK court, where such cases are easier to bring. The characters are stereotypes. Rachel Weisz' Queens accent is over the top. The Brits are typical movie Brits. Harriet Walter, whom I adore on stage (What a Duchess of Malfi she was!), is cringe-making as a character who pops up regularly to represent the voice of all the Holocaust survivors residing in London. Tom Wilkinson is pretty good as the barrister. Timothy Spall is creepily effective as a British neo-Nazi ""historian."" I rather liked Andrew Scott.David Hare has done good work, as a playwright and as a screenwriter. Denial is an exception. The screenplay, loosely based on a true story, deserved better treatment."
" Mick Jackson's TV experience truly shows...
",2017-08-30 00:00:00,4,"For Denial, the most shocking thing about this film was that it was made in 2016. Everything about the camera work is so bland and uninspired at introducing Professor Deborah Lipstadt that if enough context was removed this film could literally be about any female professor that's liked by her students. The initial barrage of Professor Lipstadt's routine is a series of extremely bland cuts from organically lit shot to organically lit shot, and in that barrage the blandness emerges. The trope of the beloved professor is so shoehorned in to create a character for Prof. Lipstadt that I feel completely alienated from the character at large. Denial's pacing alone is so bizarre at jumping to the lawsuit that I'm wondering why I should care about a story fighting Nazism. Jackson feels as though he's done enough to make me empathize with Prof. Lipstadt by showing me at the 14 minute mark how she'll be fighting an uphill legal battle. Around the 19 minute mark, Jackson choses to actively waste our time with an extremely unoriginal rainy London sequence to establish that she has arrived, and even though it's a minute long it's failure of purpose makes it stand out so belligerently. Rachel Weiss' acting as Lipstad feels so inorganic that I am completely skeptical and extremely bored by lines meant to be inspirational as ""my mother always said there was gonna be an event. That I was picked out, I was chosen well here it is."" (16:01) That alone is one of many lines that seems to have been taken verbatim from a book. Denial at large is a very aggressively okay film, and at large it seems as though the only thing it's missing is commercial breaks. A quick look through Denial's director's past works shows that the vast majority of his experience prior to his 2016 film is in television. Denial's entire goal of presenting an uphill battle for truth against hate, with it's recurring shots of stairs among other grandiose imagery of rising above, fails so spectacularly entirely because of it's pacing and strange dipping in and out of Documentarian nature. If a film tells me that it's ""based on true events"" then why on earth is it showing me meaningless dates and times? Saying your movie is ""based on true events"" is the most blatantly lazy form of opening a film beyond subtitles showing location and narration, which this film also does. Denial if anything seems in denial of the fact that it's not an HBO series, but a film."
" Truth will always win
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,8,"The historical drama 'Denial' by Mick Jackson thematizes the post- truth world by focusing on the topic of Holocaust denialism and the lawsuit of David Irving against historian Deborah Lipstadt.Referring to the Leuchter report, historic writer and self-appointed historian Irving claims that the Holocaust never existed and even accuses survivors of it as frauds. Historian Lipstadt publishes a book in which she stands up against these lies, but Irving fights back in form of a lawsuit, since his reputation is now ruined. A few years later, Lipstadt and her lawyers must prove that she is in the right and that the Nazi regime's crimes against humanity happened.This film really has the finger on the pulse: It conveys a topical message to the audiences and raises significant questions how far the freedom of speech goes. By exposing the tactics of Mr. Irving, it draws a parallel to today's alt-right movement and how they create their own alternative version of the world (and of history). Even here on IMDb are people who defend Irving (actually, quite alarmingly lot), although he is a Hitler apologist, an open racist and denies the crimes against humanity the national socialists committed. As Lipstadt expounds, denying the Holocaust and being pro-Nazism is against the basic principles of modern societies. Thus, no one can call the film ''biased'', as there is just one acceptable opinion! - but that's another point and maybe this is not the best place here to discuss it. The film talks about this, especially in the end, highlighted by a strong, terrific statement by Lipstadt. Moreover, there are two brilliant scenes where barrister Richard Rampton, played by Tom Wilkinson, undertakes a frontal attack against Irving and unmasks his lying strategy. Applause, applause!The second big plus of the film is its accurate authenticity conveyed by the actors – ALL of them are glorious in their roles. My big respect goes to Timothy Spall who interprets the disgusting character of Irving in a chilling way. Rachel Weisz really shows how important the history for Deborah Lipstadt is and gives her a heroic warmth, but also a sentimental side. All the humanity which is missing in Irving can be found in her. Tom Wilkinson and Andrew Scott portray the lawyers Rampton and Julius who focus on the facts and figures much to the dismay of Lipstadt. But both get some human scenes as well and it is more than pleasant to see the showdown between Rampton and Irving where he finally looks this man in the eyes and takes him down. Again applause! Some conflicts appear between Lipstadt and her lawyers, but sadly they are only adumbrated: Julius has obviously some other motives than justice and Deborah has a rumpus with him over the question whether the Holocaust survivors should testify or not. Ultimately, this is never played out fully, but is compensated by the authentic performances of the main actors.Sounds like a food-for-thought-drama to watch, nevertheless its IMDb ratings are not always so rosy (even by people who are not Irving fans, I suppose :)). Why so? The biggest problem of the film, beside its uninspirational and easy forgettable score is that the main enemy, Mr. Irving, is very soon forced onto the defensive. There are some scenes where he tries to manipulate and win over the judge and the public, but there is no offensive counter strike against Lipstadt, not a gripping confrontation. I do not think that this makes the film boring, no, the 109 minutes pass by quickly, but on the contrary, it also eliminates any surprises concerning the dramaturgy of the storyline. Thanks to several questions – How can something which definitely happened be proved in court? What is the price of fighting for the truth?... – and thanks to the extreme degree of topicality, an interested viewer will keep watching. This validates that the film makes something right. Nonetheless, the criticism that 'Denial' feels in part generic, because of its lack of originality and suspense may not seem too far- fetched. For example: the scenes in the court, which use the real dialogue of the trial, give the film a documental touch, but may seem a bit low- paced to some.Overall, the message and topic of 'Denial' is so pertinent for the current condition the discussion culture in democracies finds itself. This film can bolster all who fear that far-right politicians like Marine Le Pen or Donald Trump can skew the history with their alternative facts. Instead, the story of David Irving's downfall proves that truth will always win. Without a shadow of a doubt, the film has a noble ambition and a significant message, but in a cinematic sense, Denial is not a perfect film – I really don't know who to blame for the genericism. More depth and less generic courtroom discussions and lawyer meetings would have been appropriate. Not only the audiences but the topic deserves it.Generous 8 pts."
" awfully biased and utterly one sided with some good acting.
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,1,"the movie is poorly written with a soul intention of defaming one person and possibly to show what happen to holocaust deniers. the makers of the movie didn't realize that the people who knew nothing or have very little knowledge about holocaust actually will become more skeptic rather than sympathetic.i am not a sympathizer of David irving and frankly i never knew him before this movie. watching this movie one thing was clear, the writer was clearly biased against David irving by not showing his part of argument.the movie was based on a case which was carefully constructed by powerful lawyers team against one defenseless person and their strategy to proving him a liar instead of countering his claim with facts. at the end of the trial all they managed to prove that Irving was an anti-semite and did manipulate the fact but the point of whether holocaust actually happened or not remain a question.i watched this movie hoping that there will be trials based on facts to prove and historical event but sadly i am very disappointed.the only good thing about the movie is the acting of lead actors. Rachel weisz was exceptionally good. Tom Wilkinson, Timothy Spall and Andrew Scott did a good job"
" The Devil in the details
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,8,"When I was growing up in the 1950's and 60's in Australia, we were very aware of the Holocaust, we often saw documentaries on TV showing the concentration camps and the piles of naked, skeletal dead being buried in mass graves. Despite the censorship of the time - you couldn't depict anything like that in a movie - we were spared nothing in those documentaries.Years later I was surprised that there was such a thing as Holocaust Deniers. Then David Irving's name started to loom large especially when he was banned from coming to Australia.""Denial"" is about the libel trial Irving brought against Deborah Lipstadt (Rachel Weisz), an American historian who had called him a Holocaust Denier, a distorter of history and a bigot. The film is well-made with a classy British cast, although greatly condensed from the actual trial.The striking Rachel Weisz doesn't look like Lipstadt, but does an impressive job on the accent (judging from interviews with the real person). As the film shows, Lipstadt engaged the top legal team in Britain: solicitor Anthony Julius (Andrew Scott) and barrister Richard Rampton (Tom Wilkinson). The audience is introduced to the finer points of British libel law as the defence team explains it to Lipstadt. They had to prove that Irving deliberately falsified facts. For him to have simply made mistakes - human error - was not enough.Irving played by the brilliant Timothy Spall, represented himself, unwisely as it turned out - Tom Wilkinson's Rampton belts him all around the courtroom catching him out on point after point. In a telling scene, Rampton quotes from Irving's diary revealing an unpleasant little ditty Irving recited to his child that pointedly showed where the guy was coming from.Interestingly, although Lipstadt and Rampton visit the remains of Auschwitz early in the movie, there is none of the footage of the concentration camps that made such an impact when I was growing up. Maybe the filmmakers felt that it would have forcibly swung the emotions rather than the focus on details in the documents that finally decided the issue. Although the film is firmly in Lipstadt's corner, Irving's views do get an airing.As for those views, doesn't banning Irving, or throwing him in prison as the Austrians did, tend to give his arguments more weight than they deserve? I think a movie such as ""Denial"" is more effective, zeroing in as it does on the falsehoods, showing that he should be taken no more seriously than those who use bad science to claim the moon landings were faked.Without trying to make light of one of the most evil events in history, Irving reminds me a bit of Franz Liebkind, the author of ""Springtime for Hitler"" played by Kenneth Mars in Mel Brooks' ""The Producers"", but without the helmet."
" Based On Historical Evidence
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,9,"Excellent movie. Gripping. This movie has great acting by strong actors. The story line is well done. The trial and wait for the verdict create suspense until the end. While on a serious historical subject, the movie was well worth the time. Highly recommend it. It also gives one pause as you listen to news reports today - what is fact and what is opinion?For those of us who know both holocaust survivors and highly repentant descendants of Nazi perpetrators this movie touches the heart as you hope for a wise verdict."
" Should have been better
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,5,"I have to say that my overriding thought whilst watching this film is that I should have been enjoying it more.The film tells the true story of a libel case brought by David Irving (Timothy Spall) against Deborah Lipstadt (Rachel Weisz). Irving is a holocaust denier and the case is played out as a trial against the historical truth of the holocaust. The cast is excellent, but the script could have done with a few rewrites.Maybe it's due to the absurdity of holocaust denial, but it was really difficult to get a feel for the characters motivations throughout the film. From the movie clips you would imagine that you would be passionately involved in the film, but that never really happens. By the end of the film you walk out wondering whether your time may have been better invested in reading the book. Maybe I'll read the book and see whether that's true."
" Treat This Film as a Film
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,6,"Denial may not be the best Holocaust-related movie ever made, but to use its limitations as a platform to affirm Holocaust denial is far more wrong-headed. The millions of victims and survivors of the Holocaust – as well as the Allied troops that witnessed first-hand the horrors that had occurred when they marched into the camps, the Nuremberg trials tribunal (with actual filmed records used as evidence), and countless other voices – require no ""proof"" of this atrocity. It was murder, plain and simple, and whether on a mass or individual level, the victims of such (or any) crime must be served and punishment brought to the perpetrators. Thankfully, the Nazi regime of wartime Germany is in the past while those who have opposed it thrive on in the present. More than a dozen European countries (including Germany) have laws deeming Holocaust denial as illegal. Current German criminal law also bans ""incitement to hatred"" against any particular group within the population. Deniers of the Holocaust can shout as loudly as they want. It won't change the truth.I too found Denial to be disappointing, for various reasons also cited. Elements in its acting and script struck me as possessing an overstated obviousness that worked against the effectiveness of the film. But the focus of these reviews should be the film, not the history. As another IMDb reviewer states, some of the negative reviews are politically motivated. These few are trying to denigrate not just the film but also its message. Thank goodness the majority of other reviewers think otherwise and treat the film fairly – as a film."
" wow - some haters here
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,7,"Some people seem to have a big problem with this film. I didn't. I found it very interesting and while not mind-bendingly great, it wasn't the horror that it's presented to be in some of these reviews.""Denial"" is based on the book ""History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier."" It is the story of Deborah E. Lipstadt (Rachel Weiss) and her legal battle in a libel trial brought by Holocaust denier David Irving (Timothy Spall). In the British legal system, the burden of proof is on Lipstadt, who has maintained in her writings that Spall has fudged certain facts and left out others to make his case that the Holocaust did not happen. Her team, led by Richard Rampton (Tom Wilkinson) and Anthony Julius (Andrew Scott) make it clear to the feisty Deborah that they are putting Irving on trial. They are not interested in Holocaust survivor testimony, because they say that Irving will make mincemeat out of them since their memories often aren't perfect. They do not want her to take the stand. The trial is to prove the truth of Lipstadt's writings about Irving.One of the reviewers wrote that the Irving portrait is highly distorted. The dialogue in the courtroom is verbatim from the actual transcripts. You tell me if this man is a Jew-hating racist or not and if he in fact misrepresented facts to fit his agenda. No one said he didn't have a right to believe what he believed, to make jokes about other races during speeches, to teach his daughter racist songs, make fun of the Holocaust, and write his opinions. But he brought the lawsuit because he was accused of distorting facts, no one else did. The most moving scene was the team's visit to Auschwitz, very well photographed and movingly acted.The acting was sensational, though I have to admit that Rachel Weisz did overplay at certain points. She is a wonderful actress, and having seen her in person in ""Betrayal,"" I can testify that she's unbelievably gorgeous in person. But the director could have toned her down a little in some scenes. Andrew Scott is one of the finest young actors around, and he's brilliant as always. Tom Wilkinson is perfection as Richard Rampton.Why this film should have incited such awful comments on this board is beyond me. It's a movie. If you want to know more about Holocaust denial, read up on it. Read up on Irving. See if you think his character was distorted. Everyone knows films use dramatic license. Denial is not perfect. It has some clichés, it has the David v. Goliath thing going - and yes, none of that is new. But it doesn't deserve to be trounced on like a work of Satan."
" Prejudiced Negative Reviews Bring the Overall Rating Down
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,10,"Rating this film is a complex issue. If you read the very negative reviews and read between the lines, you will discern that those reviewers are politically-motivated. They are not rating the film; they are rating its message, that message being that the holocaust did happen and it was monstrous.This film is well-written, well-acted, and well-directed. It has some of the best one-liners I've heard in a long time -- only some of which have shown up on IMDb's 'Quotes"" section.The thing I most enjoyed was the conflict between Ms. Lipstadt (the American defendant in the libel suit) and her team of Britian's best lawyers. Her passion vs. their logic. Her desire to be heard, vs. their desire to win. And they were both on the same side. Oh, the angst!Such a shame that this film didn't get a wide release at the theaters. I found it by accident, looking for something to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I wish I'd seen it in a theater, but I wasn't aware of its existence until it was way too late to view it on a big screen. How did this riveting tale escape the notice of the general public? Watch it and tell others to do the same. It's too good to pass up."
" Fact Based Story of one notorious Holocaust Denier
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,6,"David Irving (Timothy Spall) is a self educated British historian who wrote numerous tomes based on his studies of the archives in which he decided or rather concluded that the Holocaust has been a bit exaggerated by the Jews. Rachel Weisz plays Deborah Lipstadt who in 1996 he sued for libel at the High Court in London. His case was that she had denigrated him and his works in her book about Holocaust denial.If you are accused of libel in the UK then you have to prove that what you said was true (one of the defences). It is what is known as justification. Penguin books appointed a sterling defence team who decided that they would put history on trial and use this as a vehicle to debunk Mr Irving for once and for all. What follows is essentially a court based drama.Now this is a good film. It is from the BBC but they are wont to play to the galleries these days and that is what happens here. It is overly emotional and despite a stellar cast that includes John Sessions, Tom Wilkinson and Mark Gatiss it never quite equals the sum of its parts. Rachel Weisz is an excellent actress but she does over play it in some scenes but then manages to pull it back. Timothy Spall is the most consistent and believable of all in a role which continues to demonstrate his virtuosity as an actor. All in all a film that is very much worth seeing."
" Could have been so much better
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,5,"A fascinating ""case study"" and such important material. Liked a great deal of this movie, but I couldn't get over how disappointing Rachel Weisz's performance was. Can she act? Was this acting or was it just poor direction. Substitute Meryl Streep or any other great actress and the movie would have won awards. I've always liked Weisz and was really surprised and will chalk it up to direction. Rest of the cast was excellent and it's a highly memorable film."
" Fascinating
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,9,"This movie was riveting. It's impossible to pack so much heavy material and detail into 2 hours, but it does masterfully. Rachel Weisz nails her character flawlessly, the Queens accent, mannerisms, reactions, timing: sublime. The editing, flow, and pace of the movie were on point. There were no slow points or rabbit holes, and they weaved in backstory in seamlessly. I had not known about this controversy, but with the gruesome Trump presidency situation, this movie is a sorely needed reminder that TRUTH MATTERS and while justice might move slowly, the truth will win. I also enjoyed Alex Jennings from The Crown series in his role here as the judge. Masterful movie on a fascinating topic, bravo."
" Important, powerful, underrated
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,8,"Denial is important, powerful and, it seems, underrated. Given the assault on truth and facts going on right now, it could hardly have been made at a better time. Wilkinson, Weisz and Spall are all superb, as usual, as is the screenplay by the brilliant David Hare. Is the direction a little flat? Maybe. Or maybe the director decided to get out of the way and let the story speak for itself. That's a matter of opinion. What's not a matter of opinion is the fact that Irving was exposed as a liar by the British High Court in 2000, and thus discredited amongst academics. User reviews claiming that he is somehow discredited by this movie are therefore very wide of the mark, as well as suspicious. How can you discredit someone who has already been discredited? The assault on reality by extremists is real. We need the arts to shine a light on it. Denial is a good effort to do just that."
" Courtroom drama, but different
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,6,"In this era of alternative facts and fake news, a movie about the truth, and the denial of it, is more than welcome. The film is an account of the 1996 court case brought by holocaust denier David Irving against historian Deborah Lipstadt. She and her legal team had to prove the holocaust really happened, in order to defend herself against Irving's libel charge.The film shows rather accurately how they did that, by hiring experts on the design of death camps, and visiting Auschwitz in order to be able to debunk Irving's claims. This whole legal process gets an extra dramatic dimension by contrasting the fact-based legal battle with the emotional arguments concerning the grief of the survivors. Lipstadt is dumbfounded when she learns the defense team doesn't want the survivors as witnesses, and doesn't want her to say anything at all during the trial. In court, only facts count. Emotions are distractions from the facts.The confrontations between the passionate Lipstadt and her ultra-cool solicitor Anthony Julius are the highlights of the film. But on the whole, this movie is rather straightforward. It is interesting because its subject is interesting, not from a cinematographic point of view.By the way: David Irving is still denying. On his website, he denies being the source of the 'no holes, no holocaust'-claim which is discussed in the film."
" Fantastic, highly relevant
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie yesterday and it is nothing short but fantastic. It is largely based on reality of course. And reality - or more precisely truth - is also the main subject of the film. Of course, it deals more specifically with the question of Holocaust denial. But its subject is extendable and applicable, to a very large degree, to all very actual questions of ""alternative facts"", or to all questions and (often gigantic) problems that arise in our ""post truth"" society. However sure it is that the tragedy of the Holocaust really happened, it appears to be difficult to really prove it. Opportunists without a conscious, or with really bad intentions, take advantage of it. Do this on purpose and stick fanatically to it. These are very real dangers, that threaten our societies now more than ever. The acting is really great too. I particularly appreciated the performances of Rachel Weisz, Tom Wilkinson and Timothy Spall. I almost never do that, but I gave this movie a 10 out of 10."
" Fantastic
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,9,"An extremely moving movie. Keeps you pumping ready to join in the argument. I loved the poignant flashbacks of Rachel's character, not to mention her tremendous courage in the face of such an ignorant man, it truly showed her steady persistence. The actual title says it all and is what made the movie so much more than just 90 minutes acting on screen. I am appalled but not surprised by anyone who actually believes that nothing happened, it's going on right now and yet many have no clue. I can't recommend this movie enough, it is just that great."
" Amazing Film One you must not miss
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,10,"Rachel Weisz as ever is brilliant. The film is amazing. The subject is very, very difficult and the storyline is so well written that all aspects of genocide denial and looking at genocide head on is tackled without being too sentimental. And there is so much depth to the film. You have to watch this film. It is written so well and covers a piece of history that most, including the amazing character Rachel plays, find hard to deal with. At the same time the so called logic (and fabrication) of genocide denial that has grown over decades is dealt with in such a gritty manner. The last time I saw Rachel Weisz in an amazing piece was the Constant Gardner. Brilliant!"
" 'They're a strange thing consciences. Trouble is, what feels best isn't necessarily what works best.'
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,10,"DENIAL is one of those films that no matter who you are or what your convictions might be it is an experience to absorb both sides of a controversy and discover how opposite sides develop their perception and convictions. This stunning film is based on Deborah Lipstadt's book ""History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier"" and is beautifully adapted for the screen by David Hare (""The Reader', 'The Hours', 'Page Eight', 'Damage'). Directed with a keen sense of timing and flow by Mick Jackson, this is one of the finest movies of the past year – and an obviously overlooked film for the Academy Awards.The story takes place in 1993, first in Georgia in a classroom where Deborah Lipstadt (a radiant Rachel Weisz) is interrupted in her teaching by Holocaust denier David Irving (Timothy Spall). A team of lawyers defends a libel suit by Irving against Deborah – the lead being Richard Rampton (Tom Wilkinson) and his staff (Andrew Scott, Jack Lowden, Caren Pistorius et al) who travel to England for the trial. Hilton McRae portrays the judge and the various examinees include Mark Gatiss as Prof van Pelt and many examples of the extant Auschwitz concentration camp. It is harrowing to watch.Brilliantly acted by a stellar cast, rich in history and important information, and with a stunning musical score by Howard Shore, DENIAL is a film that ranks with the finest. Highly recommended."
" There was a good movie somewhere in there waiting to happen, but it didn't
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,4,"Instead we got a merely OK effort. The movie is not actually bad, it has interesting moments and a clever inter-textual message that relates to current events but sadly I can't ignore that it leaves the message it tries to transmit feeling empty, defeated and overused.The movie talks about a dispute between historians and it's based on true events. One historian, a Jew, writes a book about Holocaust denialists and calls the second historian antisemitic and racist because he denies the Holocaust happened. The second historian sues the first and the movie is mainly about the trial, both the preparation for it and the execution.Now the movie cleverly tries to illustrate an issue that is very fresh in the collective minds of the public currently and that is fake news, populism, etc etc. The second historian, the populist, is portrayed as the loud person who loves to engage others in debate and listen to himself talking. He is immune to facts, data, reason, anything that goes against his discourse. The first historian, or at least her defending team of lawyers, champion calmness, methodical and surgical engaging, silence and reason over loudness and emotion.The thing is that, even if reason can prevail on a trial, reality shows that the populist will most likely win just because he can't lose at all and, in the end of the movie, something like that is hinted at but it is never developed as a plot point, instead it's rapidly dismissed. And I think that exploring this aspect would have been very interesting at least because that's one of the main concerns about what to do with populism nowadays.Another issue I have with the whole point the movie is trying to convey is that the main attack against the populist is that his racism and antisemitism makes him an unreliable and dishonest historian. But the irony of it all is that the first historian is portrayed as a Jew that is highly emotionally involved on her work to the point that she can't think rationally most of the time when trying to discuss the issues at hand. In other words the main argument against the populist is also the main argument against the supposed rational side. This is defeating for the movie because the argument in the end is unconvincing and weak. If the movie was trying to make an argument in favor of the truth I feel that it weakened it instead. Granted it also can be seen as a very realistic situation that happens all the time, in the end we are all humans and emotional judgments are what we do best so maybe the movie was trying to show us the flawed nature of what we understand as truth and reason?? I'm not sure but it didn't seem so at least.Finally another issue I have unrelated particularly to this actual movie is the excessive focus on cinema towards the Holocaust, 2nd WW, Hitler, etc. Granted it was a very traumatizing time and any sensible person agrees that the Holocaust shouldn't have happened and that it was a shameful moment in human history. But I can't help but feel that the continuous outrage of Hollywood towards this tragedy is dishonest at best. When will Hollywood make a movie about the suffering of the Palestinians under the oppression of Israel which is a current tragedy and a highly ironic one given that the Israelis are also in denial of how their government is doing atrocious things. This makes me think that Hollywood gets a phony sense of selective outrage at some tragedies, mainly those that pay their salaries."
" 'Denial' is extensively confused in tone, constantly peaking and falling throughout its rushed narrative
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,4,"Rachel Weisz dons an unconvincing American accent to play the accused professor, Deborah Lipstadt, fighting to prove that David Irving (Timothy Spall) is purposefully manipulating historical fact to support his own anti-Semitic views. Clearly, this may be a delicate subject for some, and yet this story is so caught up in the legalities it regularly fails to address this issue. Naturally, it is uplifting in the places where it is supposed to be, but 'Denial' loses its punch by disappointingly being too muddled in its approach, neglecting particular details that could have made it a truly gripping drama.In an era when the likes of ""fake news"" and ""alternative facts"" are looming worryingly pertinent over our polarised society, 'Denial' entails a certain amount of contextual parallels, focussing primarily on, and addressing adequately, the consequences of words. Otherwise, it is a relatively hollow drama, attempting to amplify the puzzling legalities of the situation over-ambitiously. Isolate the context of the Holocaust and the unquestionable relevance of the themes depicted, and 'Denial' falls as yet another juridical drama bogged down in justifying its own existence. It has little substantial impact due to the broadness of the unfolding events and its lacklustre attack at pre-determined consequences, weakening the sharpness of the overarching story.As well as this, the way the characters are presented truly damages the intended impression, particularly in the behind the scenes moments where the essence of the case is being discussed. Rachel Weisz comes across as a whiny and useless figurehead of the case, desperate to have her voice heard. It doesn't help that she is wearing an awful orange mop for a wig that shifts in texture and colour throughout the film's course, presumably due to re-shoots (I'm having flashbacks to Obi-Wan Kenobi in 'The Phantom Menace'). Andrew Scott portrays the inordinately-determined lawyer Anthony Julius in about ten separate manners, adding to the confusion of the feature's tone; Tom Wilkinson has some great moments in the courtroom as the team's leader Richard Rampton, but these do not come in the required quantity or quality to heighten the interest in the film. It is Irving who is the most compelling character in the end, thanks to Spall's charismatic performance which inflicts the only shred of emotion in this film, that being an appropriate distaste towards Irving's case, yet this is not enough to save 'Denial' from the depressingly unsatisfying end result.It's one of those movies that might have been more suitable to be presented on the small screen, stretched over a longer time period thus allowing it to explore the tortuous legal fight in greater detail, whilst also allocating more time to handle the nature of the situation with greater prominence. Instead, Lipstadt's book on which the film is based, 'Denial: The Holocaust on Trial', is forced to settle for a fundamentally rushed and disarrayed adaption, that unfortunately showcased its best moments in its exhilarating trailer."
" Disappointing
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,"I was very much looking forward for this one. Apart from my interest in philosophy, which I think this story touches a great deal on, the content about what the story is saying is by itself important and intriguing. We live in a world that is full of shades of truth and lie, but there are things that simply aren't up for debate. That's what we call facts, be them historical facts or empirical facts. So my expectation was high. And that may have just been too much. Deborah Lipstadt, as played in the movie by Rachel Weisz, is just too affected and dumb to make any sense of. Her lines don't make sense and she is constantly trying to appear just too much involved in the story, but highly unconvincingly. Her acting and scripts are very bad, and they ruin a great part of the movie. You have to constantly keep ignoring her and focus on the story at large to avoid losing interest in the movie completely. It's a shame, because the story has much potential that touches on a lot of important philosophical issues, such as truth, ethics, rights. Indeed, it's a lost opportunity."
" A stinker only saved by Timothy Spall
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,3,"Rachel Weitz gives one of the worst performances you'll ever see and is out-acted in every scene. A real stinker of a film, that comes across more like a cheap, made for TV, court room drama than a proper movie. Only Timothy Spall comes out of it with any credit, how this could be mentioned as a possible Oscar nominee is madness, worst film I've seen all year."
" British Justice
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,7,"A lot of the best drama is on TV these days. The proof of this is that anybody over 45 is driven mad for 15 minutes with ""trailers"" of robots blowing the heads off of other robots. Denial is similar to the best of TV drama we see on our screens in the UK. Although I knew of the outcome to the trial I found the film very watchable , as the rest of the cinema audience did where we saw the film. The test for this is that I did not see the light of one cell phone during the whole 100 minutes of the film. The outstanding performance was by Tom Wilkinson as the barrister defending Deborah Lipstadt. Holocaust Denier historian David Irving was suing Lipstadt over her books stating that his ""history"" was a pack of lies. The court case sticks to the actual court proceedings without any histrionics, which in my opinion is completely correct. The problem for this drama is that because it is factual Rachel Weisz as Lipstadt doesn't have much to do,but get in the way of her legal team.After a while you begin to find her acting "" Queens"" accent a little bit grating. Not because it is a Queens accent,but because she is trying a bit too hard to get it right. Maybe as a Brit I a not being fair. Timothy Spall as David Irving shows us what a dangerous charlaton he was and still is. Although since the trial shows up what a liar he is . I wonder if Deborah Lipstadt was found guilty the many people walking away from the cinema would of been saying "" I don't remember that case"" And that was in a cinema in North London where a fair proportion of the audience were Jewish."
" An underrated drama
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,7,"This is a very solid, under the radar movie. Deniers have always fascinated me. Whether it be the Holocaust, 9/11, or now all of a sudden the earth being round. Some people find value and, ultimately, attention by questioning an already sensational event or fact. The given truth is too mainstream for some. Rachel Weisz didn't really stand out in this role. In fact, her character is more of an observer to the events rather than a participant. Timothy Spall, who plays the denier, was excellent. I haven't really liked any of his performances in the past so this was a good surprise. The movie has the proper tone for the material, but allows for well-placed levity. A quietly powerful film."
" A courtroom drama about who's right and who's wrong!
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,7,"There are many factors to consider, especially for a film like this. Yep, the film was based on the real courtroom event. The film is about two people to prove they're right on their book about the war crimes whether that took place or not. So all the episodes take place in a British high court with mention of Auschwitz concentration camp, particularly about its ruins than the events that happened in there. That means it's a great drama to learn about how these two fought in a lawsuit face-off, but there's nothing about the real event just like the film 'The Eichmann Show'. If you are not a Jew or a neo nazi or not even a European and North American, then this is an okayish film from the entertainment aspect, other than learning truth and history.I really expected some real events, but we have already seen in many films about Auschwitz camp. So they kept this film as a modern day court trial than mixing up with those old crime. Great acting by all. Timothy Spall nailed it in his negative role. He was just a fine supporting actor, till I started to recognise him since his genius display in a biopic, 'Mr. Turner'. This is his one of the top performances. He could play Don Trump in his biopic, beside Rob Redford who's a bit old for that. Rachel Weisz was okay. Her role was not strong enough, despite she's in the main character. Because everyone around her took the honour to rise above hers. Be it Tom Wilkinson, who was surprisingly awesome.So in my perspective the film was good, but not great. The courtroom events lacked strong hold with what a film needs and what the viewers wants with twists and turns in the argument. But I'm very happy being honest than modifying its story to make film commercial worthy. Though the film had some its own moments, in the end it was not enough. Particularly how it concludes and to think why this trial even took place makes no sense at all. Seems more a joke than anything serious, just because of someone being crazily challenging and the other one responding to it. Anyway, it's still largely a sensitive matter and my view is just as an outsider. But the film is worth a watch, if you are not expecting a bigger picture after reading its synopsis.7/10"
" A lesson from contemporary history
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,9,"This is a fine film. Full credit to a great cast, the director Mick Jackson and the distinguished playwright David Hare for his screenplay.Despite knowing the outcome, I found the courtroom scenes really thrilling, and when Mr Justice Gray (Alex Jennings) asks whether David Irving (Timothy Spall) might not have denied the Holocaust in good faith the shock is quite electrifying.The tensions between Deborah Lipstadt (Rachel Weisz) and her legal team are very intense; the solicitor Anthony Julius (Andrew Scott) appears rather arrogant and high-handed but it becomes clear that (to quote Hamlet) he's being 'cruel only to be kind'. This redeems the soap-opera touches, as I see them, in their exchanges. It's understandable that Lipstadt should find the lawyers' strategy perplexing.Similarly, the brilliance of Richard Rampton QC (Tom Wilkinson) in court offsets a tendency towards caricaturing him as a bibulous lawyer with a fund of legal anecdotes.In Timothy Spall's portrayal Irving, representing himself in court, seems dogmatic and devious yet by no means confident of victory. Though clearly concentrating hard, he looks pretty confused. His exchanges with the historian Sir Richard Evans (John Sessions) are embarrassingly unconvincing. At one point he says 'I'm not a Holocaust historian.' That isn't a confession, just an attempt to duck an awkward question from Evans. There's more embarrassment when he tries to look like a good loser.Only one Holocaust survivor appears in the film: a woman who begs Lipstadt to enable her to testify. Others must have been in court as well, but the woman has a symbolic role. Though unable to grant her wish, Lipstadt assures her that 'The voice of suffering will be heard.' Those words are profoundly moving.The voice of suffering was indeed heard. Unfortunately, as James Libson (Jack Lowden), a junior lawyer at the time, has remarked, the longer-term consequences ran counter to expectations. Holocaust denial has spread through the internet and Irving claims, chillingly, 'Interest in my work has risen exponentially in the last two or three years. And it's mostly young people.' ('The Observer', 15 January 2017)Neo-fascist and similar movements are growing across Europe, no doubt encouraged by Donald Trump's election in the USA. 'Denial', then, is also a terrible warning. It teaches a lesson from contemporary history (in 2000) as well as history in the broader sense – at least for those able to learn.Against the dark decor of the lawyers' offices and the courtroom there are some lighter touches with local colour from London. One long scene, however, takes place at Auschwitz."
" Denial may not be the most exciting of films, but it may be the most important film you see this year.
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,8,"Understated and quietly powerful, Denial offers a satisfying and tasteful dramatisation of one of the most pivotal court cases in history which couldn't be more timely if it tried. Low-key in its approach and never overly complicated in its telling, Denial's decision to put the facts and accuracies of the story front and centre is greatly felt and really respected, with a refusal to descend into cheap tricks to shock or scandalise, courtesy of a compelling and streamlined screenplay from David Hare putting clarity as the focus. Its slender 110 minute runtime is a little scattered with a stronger need for balance but it remains relatively brisk and sharp throughout. Vitalised by a real quality about it - whether that's due to the steady way it is shot, the addition of the 'BBC Films' tag, the complex subject matter it handles or very probably a combination of all of the above - Denial feels like a prestigious product of impassioned and dedicated work. Veteran director Mike Jackson utilises his skill to deliver some impressive camera work; the long, lingering shots of the Auschwitz portray an uncomfortable tranquility and stillness, contrasted with the horrors the camp enclosed, with Jackson demonstrating this in a respectful and sensitive way; the whole sequence is without its loud, gratuitous and ostentatious moments and uses this slice of historical iconography in a moving and refined way. The same can be said for the way he considers the themes of the piece too, examining the importance of preserving and protecting our history and truth in an impactful way that never loses focus of this message."
" Had so much potential - like watching a trainwreck
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,4,"""Denial"" attempts to bring to the screen two of the Oscars' favorite genres: courtroom & Holocaust dramas. The story is prime: that of a woman who was taken to court over her statements about a Holocaust denier, claims that allegedly tarnished his reputation as a notable historian. The woman in question, Deborah Lipstadt (Rachel Weisz), an American, was brought to an English court in the late 1990's to prove her case: that the denier, David Irving (Timothy Spall), knowingly altered the facts to support his own beliefs. In America, the defense is innocent until proved guilty. In England, the burden of proof in fact falls on the defendant. Stuck in court with years of preparation, Lipstadt simply has to prove one thing: that the Holocaust actually happened.Thus is the set up for what could have been a brilliant movie about thinking minds and the the nature of historians and differing views. In a time when the Holocaust is in danger of becoming a clichéd topics to garner awards and praise, the trailer for ""Denial"" looked nothing short of eye-opening.History is a broad topic, breathtaking when captured effectively and dreadfully dull when it goes wrong. This is a movie where they got it wrong. Lipstadt (played by Weisz with perhaps the worst American accent we have seen on film in years) is the heroine this movie doesn't deserve. We meet her as a professor who teaches passionately about the nature of World War II and the losses it accrued. A Jew herself, the Holocaust is a passion of hers. People who refute evidence as candidly as David Irving are simply not worth her time. When faced with Irving, Lipstadt freezes, becomes argumentative, can't prove her point. The next time they meet is in court, where she promises that she will not testify. In order to win the case, she must remain impartial.Her defense team is made up of a team of lawyers and scholars, the leader of which is Richard Rampton (Tom Wilkinson), who is a calculated criminal lawyer who knows his facts but can't grasp the emotions of the case itself. Anthony Julius (Andrew Scott) is the would-be villain who wants to win the case but in the process loses all sense of respect for the survivors of such tragedy. It's a crack team, indeed.The problems with the movie are vast, but they are rooted in the simple fact that Timothy Spall as David Irving is simply the more compelling character, regardless of him being the villain. How wrong it is for someone to so plainly deny the events of the 1940's that led to millions of deaths, but Irving is played as a man who still lives honestly, presents plain facts, and seems to truly believe that he is in the right. Weisz on the other hand plays her role like a whiny girl who can't get a word in and is simply a hindrance to the plot. For a movie so devoted to this one woman's story, boy is she an annoying person to get to know.The court scenes themselves are small fragments of the 8-week trial that offer little insight into the actual arguments themselves. A brief snippet here and a tiny sentence here. The movie is padded so vigorously with fluff that by the time the verdict is read we are truly too tired to care and too distracted to have any real reaction. There is a good movie in here somewhere, and many will recall this case making the international news no more than 10 years ago. It would start with a new writer, a new cast, and a new director... In fact, with so many garbage movies being remade nowadays, here's a worthy candidate."
" Jewry Trial
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,5,"It's the mid-90's and Deborah Lipstadt (Rachael Weisz, ""The Lobster""), an American professor of Holocaust studies at a US university has written a book naming and shaming David Irving (Timothy Spall, ""Mr Turner"") as a Nazi-apologist who denies that the Holocaust ever happened. Filing a law suit against Penguin Books and Lipstadt in the UK, Lipstadt chooses to fight rather than settle and takes the case to the High Courts in a much publicised trial.Help is required and Lipstadt is assigned a hot-shot solicitor (if that's not an oxymoron) in the form of Anthony Julius (Andrew Scott, ""Sherlock"") and top barrister Richard Rampton (Tom Wilkinson, ""Selma""). The stage is set for an epic legal battle that will establish not just legal precedent but also historical precedent affecting the entire Jewish people.This film's trailer really appealed to me, and I was looking forward to this film. And that view clearly also got through to people of my age bracket (and older) since the cinema was pretty full. But ultimately I was disappointed by the film.But first the good points.The cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos (""Thor"", ""Mamma Mia"") is memorable, particularly for the Auschwitz tour which is done in an impressively bleak way on an astoundingly bleak winter's day.Andrew Scott, so woefully miscast as ""C"" in ""Spectre"", here is a nice shoe-in for the cocksure but aloof expert. And Tom Wilkinson, who can seldom put a movie foot wrong, is also perfectly cast as the claret-swigging defence-lead: passionless and analytical even when facing the horrors of a trip to Auschwitz.Timothy Spall's Irving is well portrayed as the intelligent and articulate – albeit deluded – eccentric he no doubt is.There are also some nice cameo performances, including John Sessions (""Florence Foster Jenkins"") as an Oxbridge history boffin and Mark Gatiss (""Sherlock"") as an Auschwitz expert.However, these positives don't outweigh the big negative that the broader ensemble cast never really gels together well. The first time this is evident is in an office meeting of the defence team where the interactions have a sheen of falseness about them that is barely hidden behind some weak script and forced nervous laughter. Tea can't help.In particular, attractive Kiwi actress Caren Pistorius (""The Light Between Oceans"") seems to have been given a poor hand to play with as the junior member of the team. A late night interaction with her boyfriend, who whinges at her for having to work late, seems to be taken from a more sexist age: ""the 70's called and they want their script back"".None of this is helped by Rachel Weisz, who I'm normally a fan of, but here she is hindered by some rather dodgy lines by David Hare (""The Reader"") and an unconvincing (well, to me at least) New York accent. For me I'm afraid she just doesn't seem to adequately convey her passion for the cause.While the execution of the court scenes is well done, the film is hampered by its opening five words: ""Based on a True Story"". This is something of a disease at the moment in the movies, and whilst in many films (the recent ""Lion"" for example) the story is in the journey rather than the result, with ""Denial"" the story is designed to build to a tense result that unfortunately lacks any sort of tension – since the result is pre-ordained.This is all a great shame, since director Mick Jackson (""LA Story"", in his first feature for nearly 15 years) has the potential here for a great movie. Perhaps a more fictionalised version (""vaguely based on a true story"") might have provided more foundation for a better film?(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review or search for One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

" Elvis is dead.....
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,7,"Deborah E. Lipstadt' faces a long legal battle for historical truth against David Irving, who accuses her of libel when she declares him a Holocaust denier. In the English legal system in Defamation, the burden of proof is on the accused, therefore it's up to Lipstadt and her legal team to prove the essential truth that the Holocaust occurred.Having never heard of the case or Irving (I'm not a historian), but I was shocked to find out that not not only do Holocaust deniers exist, but this one man has the audacity to actually try and sue someone for their difference of opinion.If you make derogatory remarks, that you know will irk the majority of the earths population, you are bound to be criticised, be it on television, or face to face.Spall does a tremendous job of not making Irving a pantomime villain, and the film shows us that he's a family man, and in some circumstances, an honourable person, even though his beliefs are delusional. Respect is due to the writers and Jackson for making him appear so human, so three dimensional. It could have been so easy to have cast someone like Oldman and have him on scene chewing duties.But the film belongs to Wilkinson. Coming across as rude when he visits Auschwitz, but still having body language that shows utter despair, is sensational. The whole scene set in Auchswitz is devastatingly real, it's a predictable saying, but it's like your almost there.Weisz is perfect, probably her best performance in years. Chain Reaction seems such a long time ago.It's a really insightful, but fair portrayal of one of the most fascinating, yet ridiculous trials in recent memory.Highly recommended."
" An historical essay warning that manipulators of truth will always be among us.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"The nature of truth and the power to manipulate it have long been contentious themes in history and cinema. The outstanding film Denial (2016) resonates loudly in today's post-truth world where power is often used to create alternate realities. It is a film that portrays denialism as a dangerous and perverse form of moral corruption, something that may be contained but can never be eliminated.The story is based on the celebrated 1996 legal case fought between eminent academic Deborah Lipstadt, an American professor of Holocaust Studies, and David Irving, a historian of Nazi Germany. A book published by Lipstadt (Rachael Weisz) accuses Irving (Timothy Spall) of being a Holocaust denier and falsifier of history, and Irving sues for defamation. In the British justice system, the burden of proof is on the accused so Lipstadt must prove that the Holocaust did happen to establish that Irving is a liar. She engages a top legal team led by senior barrister Richard Rampton (Tom Wilkinson) who insists that neither Lipstadt or Holocaust survivors should present testimony against Irving because of his history of promoting himself by humiliating victims. Lipstadt and her lawyers visit Auchwitz to gather evidence of the existence of gas chambers but the bulk of the story is played out on the legal battlefield at court.Modern audiences are desensitised to the atrocities of war. It is glorified in movies and video games and feeds the entertainment and amusement industry. Today's filmmakers struggle to find ways of remembering the Holocaust without alienating viewers. The extraordinary Son of Saul (2016) takes audiences right into the flames, whereas Denial (2016) explores the moral issues in a courtroom. In reality, this was a high-stakes legal battle that could have potentially de-legitimised the entire history of the Holocaust. It is an outstanding achievement that this film can capture the tension and the burden of moral responsibility carried by the Lipstadt legal team.The casting and characterisation in this film are brilliant. Rachael Weisz's American brashness presents a stark cultural contrast with the conservative traditions of British justice. She convincingly portrays a principled academic and scholar of truth, showing restrained emotion beneath her loathing for Irving's anti-Semitism. Tom Wilkinson gives a masterful portrait of wisdom and conviction, while Timothy Spall plays Irving with subdued Satanic malice. The other support cast make up a strong ensemble. The narrative unfolds at a sweeping pace and the script is both intelligent and instructive in the legal nuance of courtroom manoeuvers. The footage of Auchwitz is emotionally harrowing and the film treats its subject matter with utmost reverence.If you want light entertainment, do not see this film. It is for audiences prepared to confront the dark side of humanity as well as those interested in the intricacies and triumphs of the British legal system. But more than that, it's an essay on the nature of truth in history and it exposes the moral abhorrence of those who manipulate facts to suit their prejudices. It is also a warning that manipulators of truth will always be among us."
" Denial - a courtroom drama pursuing truth and justice.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,10,"This film is based on actual events, films based on a true story are by far my favourite. Made by BBC Films (you know you're in safe hands).This film follows the court case that David Irving brought against professor Deborah Lipstadt. She accused him of being a Holocaust denier, her evidence showed that he persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence to suit his book.Irving intended to stop Lipstadt saying he was falsifying the truth. She was confident of the ""truth"" and needed to prove what happened in Auschwitz. Lipstadt hired a legal team to defend her in the British courts where they put the burden on the defendant to prove the ""truth."", this legal team traveled to Auschwitz to conduct research and gather evidence, these scenes were particularly moving.Lipstadt and the survivors were not allowed to testify since this would have resulted in their experience being questioned and ultimately this was not the reason the case was brought, there was a good chance the case would have been compromised if their emotions were examined. The film accurately follows the actual courtroom drama as the script was based on the actual trial transcript, a complicated case heard only by a judge as it was considered too complicated for a standard jury made up of the general public to evaluate. There were truly outstanding performances from Tom Wilkinson, Timothy Spall and Andrew Scott. Extremely highly recommended viewing."
" Egyptian River Flows Down The Strand
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,7,"This is one of those 'true' story films which almost inevitably start out with one strike on them inasmuch as the majority of the viewers know the outcome going in leaving the film makers with a mountain to claim with no chance of creating suspense. As far as this viewer is concerned the film did manage to hold my attention down to the very last frame, due largely to the excellent performances from the entire cast, not least Timothy Spall who contrives to both resemble physically Edward Fox and also to sound like him; jackal indeed. Prior to reading about the film itself I was largely unfamiliar with the actual events although the PR for the film made no attempt to create a mystery and made it clear that the Spall character lost his case. At the performance I attended - on the day it opened in London - I was the sole member of the audience and this is a film that deserves better."
" Courtroom's dramatic dialog drives the design of Auschwitz' unnerving scenes.
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,10,"Few films can match the rich imagery, dialog, arguments, and suspense of the well-written and cinematographically revealing work. Rachel Weisz, Tom Wilkinson, and Timothy Spall all bring excellent performances to the screen in order for us to fathom the disconcerting premises on which the book and drama are based: rewriting history to erase the past, not to reveal our shameful heritage. The narrative involves the viewers' heart and mind in an uneasy setting where foreign laws and non-American rules hold sway over decisions that would otherwise seem to audiences as self-evident. The journey to the camp in Poland and the excruciatingly clear description of that death-dealing machinery is worth the time necessary to sort out the surrounding plot's paradoxical and significant details."
" Cliché-ridden dross ruins a potentially useful experience
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,3,"I should say right off the bat I stopped watching at about 30 minutes in. The reason I did so was that I became convinced that I would learn absolutely nothing about the real details of the court case that it depicts, which for me is a major motivation in watching any historical or legal drama.The doubt really began to set in when Weisz's character meets her English legal representative, who assures her that ""There is no presumption of innocence in UK law"" - almost a direct quote and a total misrepresentation of the facts. This kind of childish side-swipe might please some Americans in the audience, but precious few thinking ones, I would hope, especially given the subject matter of the movie.We are then shown her arriving in London in the pouring rain (of course) to meet her legal team of pompous stuffy Brits, who swiftly move her to righteous and strident anger (her character's Americanism firmly established thereby), over their apparently dishonest and underhand choice of defence strategy, and deliberate decision not to admit evidence from sufferers of the Holocaust. She cares deeply, they don't, we are led to believe.At this point it became clear to me that all I would be served up would be cardboard cut-outs parading around in a fake England, and the result would be neither enjoyable nor educational. A waste of time."
" A well delivered message
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,8,"Pros: The script is well written, the acting is great, but the element that makes this movie a well worth of time and money is that it delivers a strong message through a sad event. The holocaust memorials are not just a boring and repeatedly told fairytale, but a sad story; a justice to the dead.Cons: The writer follows a simple technique, to present the just and sympathetic against the ultimate villain, but its not quite absolute, because it shows us that he has supporters.Conclusion: Worth it. Its well written, it will keep your attention through the whole duration and its very emotional."
" Disappointing
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,3,"I think someone else said ""generic"" and that is the most accurate description of this film.I think the story is interesting (in real life) but not every real life event should be turned into a movie, and this is probably one of those events. The holocaust is a travesty, but this movie shouldn't have been made.First off, the dialogue is absolutely horrible. Every scene feels like forced exposition rather than a genuine communication between characters. This is why half the main character's lines are questions, we're just being told what questions we should be asking and then told the answer.Second, why spend so much time talking about how silly the British system of law is. That's just offensive. Third, the hero is never in any sort of jeopardy. From the outset she's afforded a high price team of lawyers and she's going up against a person who's so poor he has to represent himself.Fourth, they spend a whole lot of time speculating and assuming how nasty the villain is and what he'll do if he has the opportunity to interrogate a holocaust survivor, yet we never actual see him do anything horrible. In a movie, you have show why the villain is bad, not say why he's bad, or speculate why he's bad.Fifth, there's so much build up of trying to get the holocaust survivors on the stand to testify, yet, the main character never makes a decision to not put them on the stand. That's a big problem in a story if the main character never learns something about them self, never makes any decisions, never changes at all through the whole movie.Overall the biggest problem with the movie is that the main character isn't likable. I was never cheering for her. Maybe in real life she's great, but in the movie, she bashes a person in a book, then bashes the British legal system, then tells the million dollar lawyers how to argue the case, then bashes the lawyers while waiting for the verdict. She just bashes everyone but does nothing herself.I had really high hopes for this movie and I can't imagine being more disappointed."
" A boring approach to a very interesting subject
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,5,"What is it about court cases that TV always gets so right and movies always get so wrong? Denial, a film about an exceptional British libel case in which defendant Deborah Lipstadt had to prove the Holocaust, somehow manages to strip the integrity and interest off of this very exceptional case and make it dry as dust and dull, feeling like more like a TV show, though I've seen many hour long procedural that have managed to stir up more emotion in me. We first meet Deborah (Rachel Weisz sporting a red wig and a loud queens accent), in the early 90s. She's a professor who lectures on the holocaust and she reserves particular venom for holocaust deniers, who she loudly and proudly proclaims she will never debate as she refuses to debate facts, and that the holocaust happened is irrefutable for her. Deborah is quite happy with the work she does, but David Irving (Timothy Spall, appropriately slimy), is outraged that she has singled out him in particular. Well, it's more of a faux outrage. He uses her to gain publicity, gate-crashing one of her lectures to scream the holocaust never happened and eventually, worming his way into ""debating"" her, by suing her UK publisher for libel. The twist here is that in British courts, unlike in the U.S., it is the defendant who must prove what they said was true, rather than the plaintiff proving what they sad was false. Deborah is at first flabbergasted, but then heartened as she realizes that settling is not an option and that it is possible that she can prove that Irving is a bigot, not a proper historian once and for all. The problem is the script which has Deborah lashing out repeatedly at her own legal team for not respecting the survivors and the history repeatedly, even though they tell her repeatedly that to try to ""prove"" the holocaust happened would be arguing on Irving's terms. Instead they argue that Irving is a bigot, falsely manipulating facts to prove his own theories. Deborah flies in the face of her legal team multiple times, but this has the effect of making her look stupid and arrogant as she fights their very reasonable advice. I also got the impression that the film was trying to make a point about reasoned approaches being important instead of impassioned ones, but it is also very clear that the members of Deborah's legal team care just as much about holocaust survivors and are just as disgusted by Irving but are approaching it a different way and Deborah is making it difficult for them to do their jobs. In their own restrained ways they are just as impassioned about the work they are doing and this really has the effect of making Deborah look silly.The other thing is that the kind of slow-working case that the defence put on (the trial lasted for over a month), isn't very cinematic. Watching the movie I felt how much I wanted to read Lipstadt's book when this was all over. a movie simply doesn't have the time a book does to really reach into the details of the case and the ""highlights"" and ""victories"" seldom feel very cinematic though I'm sure they felt dramatic and wonderful in real life. I will say that the acting was solid. The three lead actors Rachel Weisz, Tom Wilkinson and Timothy Spall don't put in career best work, but they are all solid performers and turn in good performances. They are the saving grace in a movie which takes an emotional subject and somehow makes it dull."
" Direct hit, but some don't get it.
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,10,"This is the kind of movie that is made for truth and sometimes truth doesn't come with fanfare and a lawyer at the end screaming ""You can't handle the truth!"" Denial relies on facts to move it's story forward rather than emotional manipulation. It's a movie based on true events, not ""inspired"" by them. The court scenes alone were written verbatim from actual transcripts. And it is far from being void of emotion. In fact, by the end of the movie I was as nervous a wreck as if I were Deborah Lipstadt herself. The whole film has a gripping undercurrent of emotion as we watch the character of Lipstadt struggle with letting others speak for her when she craves giving herself and Holocaust survivors their own voice. But, no hoopla of emotional breakdowns, screaming, and tantrums. And it is because of the film's lack of embellishment that we get a chance to listen with objective ears to the question at hand: can the Holocaust be scrutinized and proved without eyewitnesses? Can facts alone say it did happen? As for the actors, they provide all the human insight needed to make this film come alive. So all the nonsense I've been reading about how the script didn't provide an emotional catharsis for weeping and wailing makes me wonder why critics have jobs at all. They rarely get it. Denial wasn't meant to be a weeper. It made its point very clearly with sublime and refreshing (and I mean refreshing) calm."
" It was interesting?
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,2,"What hit me was the line by Tom Wilkinson - ""Why has there not been a proper scientific study of this whole siteby reputable scientistsfifty years after the fact?"" That's a good - and fair - question.These 'Holocaust' driven movies never fail to leave me a little empty. I do understand that exact numbers (body count) is near impossible to compile. However ... usually what is left out ... or mentioned vaguely ... is the other 5-7 million non-Jews murdered by the NAZI's. Why is that? Do they not count? Should they not be remembered too? Anyway ...I'm not clear on what this movies was representing ... The legal system in the UK? ... David Irving is a convicted liar (in the UK)? ... The (many) lunatics lose in our society? Clearly (if the movie is accurate) David Irving set out to use this case as means to 'spotlight' (market?) his re-engineered history. Is this what we are to walk away with? Or is it that he failed? At best this should, at least, get some open - honest - exchanges on this subject? After all ... 'Eugenics' isn't going away and this does need to be exposed?"
" This film is tense and riveting. Not as emotional as I was expecting but still just as good. I highly recommend this.
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"""What's the proof. Where's the proof. How strong is it?"" Deborah Lipstadt (Weisz) is a writer that specializes in the Holocaust. After she writes that fellow historian David Irving (Spall) is a denier of the tragedy she is sued for libel. Now, in front of a court, Deborah must not only defend herself while at the same time proving her case but she must also do the hardest thing she has ever done. Remain silent. This is a straight up fantastic movie. The acting is great (especially Spall), the writing is great and the fact that this is a true story makes it that much better. I was expecting something extremely emotional and hard to watch. It was neither of these things. The movie follows roughly the same form as A Few Good Men in the way that the trial is about something horrific (granted the two subjects are nowhere close to the same) but the focus is on the technical aspects of the trial and not the subject itself. To me that helped this movie. Each person knows the history of what occurred and this doesn't spend a lot of time explaining it. This film is tense and riveting and I didn't know anything about this trial so that really helped my enjoyment. Overall, not as emotional as I was expecting but still just as good. I recommend it. I give this an A-."
