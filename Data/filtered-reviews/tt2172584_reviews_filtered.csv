" Waste of 2 hours
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,1,"Extremely disappointing, no characters you could empathise with bar the daughter (to some extent). Absolute pointless and tedious with very little plot. Avoid at all costs!"
" New Maps of Hell
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,7,"You could easily sit through this film thinking it the work of David Lynch, but this particular waking nightmare is the work of David Cronenberg. The first film he'd ever actually shot in Hollywood, after seven years it's beginning to look like his swansong; and he certainly wasn't mellowing."
" What why
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,5,"This movie is claustrophobic. Establishing shots? Never heard of them. Wide shots? What, no. But seriously, who would've thought Hollywood was a disgusting vapid place? Not me.
Everyone is horrible and social climbing while also being addicts. Ya know, Hollywood. Drugs are the centerpiece of this film though. Every plot line and character deals with them. We get A young, up and coming actor who is trying to get sober for a role. A washed up, PTSD ridden, narcotics obsessed actress. And a pill popping personal assistant. There's parallels between these characters not only on the drug front but they are also dealing with past trauma.
Seems like the message is ironically about a therapist unwilling to accept his daughters rehab. While his son is also going through rehab for drugs and dealing with what she did. Other then that parallel between drug abuse and mental illness there isn't much here outside of the obvious. Hollywood is gross and bad.
It's a pretty on the nose movie at best and an annoyingly trite one at worst. The dialogue is pretty full of itself and it banks hard on performances. Which are generally good except for Mr. No Shoulders Long Neck. Julianne Moore is great in this and undoubtedly the heart of the film. She's hilarious too.
Maps To The Stars has Cronenbergs typical cynicism and coldness but there's at least that heart. It seems like Cronenberg tried to distance himself from his typical body horror shtick. This is completely the opposite of body horror. A lot of it feels phony, as if he is out of his element or something. Give this script to Fincher and it would be a masterpiece. The biggest negative really is the execution. Me and Cronenberg just don't gell at all."
" WTF!?
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,4,"I think the headline for my review says enough. But, I'll also say that none of the characters are relatable at all. So, it's hard to follow in the beginning because I couldn't understand very well what the tone of the movie was supposed to be or how to take anything anyone was saying or doing. Other than that, it was weird. lol I guess it was engaging enough in that I watched the whole thing--hence the four stars--but I questioned why I was doing so half way through. As others have said, it must be a movie made expressly for Hollywood actors cause I don't get it. The one thing I can say for it, with making it a spoiler, is that there is some movement toward the end of the movie, though maybe that was done just to avoid making it too boring."
" An acting dynasty with baggage, lots and lots of baggage...
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,6,"A story of a successfully, but entirely dysfunctional family in Hollywood. ""Benjie"" (a really quite effective Evan Bird) is the obnoxious 13 year child star managed by his mother (Olivia Williams) and father (John Cusack) a psychotherapist to the stars. His sister, recently released from a sanatorium, ""Agatha"" (Mia Wasikowska) is hired by fading actress Julianne Moore (""Havana"") - on the recommendation of Carrie Fisher (the real one) to be her assistant. Add to the mix an aspiring writer Robert Pattison as their chauffeur and we get a toxic mix of ambition, despair, sex, rehab and shallowness that makes this quite a tough, but curiously plausible depiction of the lives and loves of those who live their lives largely detached from any reality aside from that driven by a film studio or a pharmacist. Moore is great as the actress trying to emulate the success of her Oscar-nominated mother; as is Wasikowska as the inscrutable ""Agatha"". It's a bit of an end in itself, this, and the characters elicit nothing for us to sympathise or empathise with; they are all pretty screwed up and I can't say that i really cared much what happened to any of them as it developed - especially the really quite ghastly ""Benjie"" but it is just about worth sticking with - if only to realise that the grass isn't always greener..."
" full speed on Neutral
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,5,I really dont know how i survived and reached the end of this movie :(
" Julianne's amazing here
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,5,"This movie is not for me
I dont like the plot
I dont like the characters
I dont like this movie
This movie suck, I felt like I was promised something in the first 15 minutes of this movie and then kept waiting only to be left with a bad taste in my mouth.
But damn the only thing that got this movie 5 stars instead of 1 is Julianne Moore's performance.
Also john cusack, love him here."
" John Cusak Makes this Unwatchable
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,2,"I like Cronenberg. To bad he cast that a-hole Cusak. He brings the film down and ruins it for me.
He's a B level actor at best. Probably C level.
Too bad"
" Falling stars
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,3,"Maps to the Stars is David Cronenberg's Mulholland Drive. Throughout, it's clear that Lynch was the influence here. It would be one thing if it was done well, but it's not. This is a dreary, confusing, annoying little film. A Ghost story, and it's not fun. Can you imagine? The characters are all draining to be around and hateable. Julianne Moore gives the one truly standout performance. She gives it her all, while the rest of the cast sleepwalks. Cronenberg has made many classics, and this doesn't diminish him one bit, but it's no wonder he hasn't made another film since this one."
" Maps to the Stars aligns the Hollywood Walk of Fame in an inconsistent twisted nightmare.
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,6,"Los Angeles. Hollywood. Tinseltown. The Dream Factory. A glittering borough where fame, fortune and fashion take hold of the very individuals who choose to pursue. Hosting a mechanical movie industry that chews up aspirational souls and spits out vile vehemence, corrupted by box office numbers and impassioned by wealth. Entertainment, amalgamated through fabricated self-important worlds, refuses to show consideration for its parasitical egotists, fuelling their lustful power evermore.A once famous yet rapidly fading actress, isolated, ambushed by the sinister shadows of her legendary movie-star mother. Taggart's ghoulish memory haunting Segrand's abused mentality, unable to remove herself from comparisons. A thirteen year-old controversial sensation, overwhelmed with money and being taken advantage of by his equally deranged parents whom manage him. Substance and alcohol abuse already fulfilling the inevitable rehabilitation tick box, likening the character to various real child stars. His estranged sister however, a pyromaniac schizophrenic, sympathetically yearning to achieve amends with her family whom rejected her, now working as the personal assistant for Segrand. Encompassing the dangers of impressionable Hollywood full circle.Cronenberg's twisted fantasy almost seems too real, satirising Western culture and their demand for entertainment. Including the traditions of award ceremonies and wealthy lifestyles enhancing the superficiality of Tinseltown regulars, where materialistic possessions overcome familial foundations. It's a tantalising drama that nearly fully realises the unearthly world Wagner set out to portray, with much gratitude to his insightful screenplay. A script that presents the Hollywood entertainment industry as an ominous vision through spirituality. The scenes involving apparitions haunting the famed stars support the supernatural torment Wagner insisted upon, supplying a refreshing perspective. The characters exploiting the most selfish attributes possible, varnished with a thin layer of sympathy to allow emotional connections. For the most part, they are incredibly detestable, but that's the purpose of Maps to the Stars. To illustrate the allurement and corruptible nature of Hollywood.Moore's performance accentuating that notion with her character. She threw herself into this role, offering a modernised version of 'Sunset Boulevard's' Norma Desmond. The pretentious screams, the exaggerative tantrums and the sudden manipulative mood shifts epitomising the negative connotations that her work implores. The remaining cast members were functional, but not in the same league as Moore. Wasikowska offered minimal dimensionality to her character's psychological detriments. Pattinson was underused in a redundant role. Cusack and Williams rarely making an impression. Then there's Bird in his second feature and, undoubtedly, required more polishing with his line delivery.Despite Cronenberg's clinical direction throughout, he loses all focus in the crumbling final act. Unnecessary deaths were plaguing the mansions of Hollywood, with one individual setting themselves on terribly visualised flames (seriously, who produced those effects? Terrible!). The subtle psychological undertone rampantly increased to a colossal volume and essentially crumbled the succinct dramatic thrills that preceded the ""shocking"" end result. Several character actions didn't make any sense whatsoever. The entire self-destructive theme was shoved in the viewer's face, whom most likely were eye-rolling at that moment anyway. And, most importantly, the conclusion never satisfied. It was an incredibly ineffective method in surmising a satire on Hollywood. Frustrating!Cronenberg was able to infiltrate the barrier of superficiality that shrouded its characters. Somehow creating human emotional output for these inhumane beasts of industrial produce. Yet he fell at the last hurdle. Reducing a sprawling satire to a minuscule disposable thriller with limited psychological perception. Whilst still enjoyable, it could've been a shining star amongst the midnight sky of dramas. Oh, and an extra point for Carrie Fisher's cameo."
" Loved It
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,10,This was far from what I expected. I like the story and I think the cast was perfectly chosen. Some of the scenes are startling but it never loses that certain quality that makes it fascinating. A fictional peek behind the Hollywood curtain is more than I could resist. Loved it. The primary criticism I have it's the ending.it should have definitely went out with more of a bang.
" Hard to Watch
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,2,Extremely weird (not in the good way) and hard to watch. There was too much going on and the storylines were redundant. I could see where they were trying to go but it seemed like they got lost along the way.
" Brilliant dialogue, awkward, baggy plot
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,7,"A film worth revisiting, if my experience is anything to go by. I didn't think it was up to much the first time, but the BBC put it on again and this time I watched it twice and probably will at least once more, partly for Julianne Moore, who's pretty astonishing, playing an almost unprecedentedly monstrous grotesque, and partly for the frequent patches of brilliantly written dialogue (take a bow, Bruce Wagner). Moore's dialogue is almost always good, but that of 13-year-old move star and recovering drug abuser Benji also packs a vicious punch, and elsewhere, more subtly, in the mouths of Mia Wasikovska and Robert Pattinson's characters, Wagner does probably the best depiction I've ever seen of how young adults actually talk a lot of the time: confused, insecure and just barely covering it up.All this is something like what we might see - and most importantly hear - if anyone ever filmed a Brett Eason Ellis novel properly, without being afraid of going to town on the dialogue (why hasn't Cronenburg ever worked with Ellis?). As such, it's an interesting point of comparison with Cronenburg's previous film, Cosmopolis, also heavy on the chilly, anomic modern rich person dialogue, courtesy of Don de Lillo, which, taken on its own, looks like woefully pretentious proof that you can't do this in film. Turns out you can, with bells on, though actually, Cronenburg films have been demonstrating this at least since Dead Ringers.Other than these talky highlights, I think this film has a few problems of its own, some of them maybe also around pretentiousness. The big one for me is just the messiness of the message and plot, as a unity, which it isn't really. Moore's storyline on its own is a perfect, pitilessly poisonous Hollywood satire. Does it really need, in addition, a parallel plot that never quite meshes about incest and schizophrenia? Why? To round it out to feature film length? To give it some spurious intellectual heft in the form of references to Greek tragedy and elemental symbolism?To be honest, there may be a puzzle here that I haven't worked out, because quite a lot of that dialogue I like so much seems to be satirising precisely such tendencies, particularly when Moore's character ghoulishly invokes fire and water to implicitly celebrate the death of a child because it gets her a part. And that's another reason I might watch again. But still, the problem remains, I don't think you need the incest or the schizophrenia to satirise Hollywood, because it introduces a sort of separate issue, a distinct emotional antagonist if you will, where Hollywood itself seems like the real target and should surely be all you need to explain all this very bad behaviour."
" Julianne gets all 3 of these stars
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,3,"I watched this right after watching the ""Come from Away"" documentary about Gander Newfoundland, which left me feeling wonderful. You see, I actually like people most of the time and felt that this was an accurate description of most of the people I know...okay...these people seemed SO nice, I almost want to move there. If they'd landed in Toronto, they wouldn't have been treated nearly as well...so I'm feeling wonderful, all warm and fuzzy, then I look to see what else is on and I remembered hearing about how wonderful Julianne Moore was in ""Maps to the Stars"". I am a Julianne Moore fan, so I watched it.
WOW! What a horrible downer of a movie. I went from feeling everyone is basically good deep down inside to watching a movie full of characters who have NO redeeming qualities at all. I almost turned it off twice, but I thought maybe there might be some redeeming type of ending where everyone might wake up and realize they are humans, not zombies. (There are no actual ""zombies"" in the film, just characters lacking souls) .
Julianne Moore's acting WAS excellent. She gets my 3 stars. John Cusak walked through the movie like he owed someone a favour. The girl was okay. Everyone else...eh...what could they do with such a hopeless plot?
This movie is devoid of any niceties at all. Oh maybe Carrie Fisher is a nice person. She appears in a cameo and isn't really a huge part of the movie though. The dog that gets shot looks like he was a nice pooch. The rest of the characters are completely unlikeable and as such I really didn't care what happened to any of them. If they'd managed to redeem themselves in any way? But they did not, so I felt depressed, gypped and robbed afterwards. Thanks so much for harsh interrogation my mellow. Not happy!"
" Could I Give a Movie Zero Stars?
",2019-09-24 00:00:00,1,"What a terrible movie. I love films about the movie industry, and actors, celebrities, etc. But this is the worst.Julianne Moore overacts again, the dude from Say Anything acts like a doofus again. The girl from Alice in Wonderland tries to be something other than Alice in Wonderland (again?). But Robert Pattinson is in it, and he's pretty cool as a struggling actor driving a limo to get by.It's the worst. Don't waste your time.0 stars"
" Insane
",2019-07-09 00:00:00,3,"The film shows that in the Weiss family, everyone is struggling mentally. With a murder, a murder attempt, a father's rejection over his daughter and an ignorant boss made the movie a nightmare, I think.The category should be thriller drama."
" Less than shining star
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,5,"Most of David Cronenberg's films range from good to outstanding. Some of his work disappointed me or evoked a relatively mixed reaction from me, but on the most part he is a very interesting director who does stand out in a good way. The cast are very talented, Julianne Moore especially, while one can understand why Cronenberg frequently used Howard Shore as his composer of choice and their collaborations is one of the best and most consistent director-composer collaborations in my view (am especially fond of his work for 'The Fly').It is said with sadness that despite hearing good things about it (though it's understandably very polarising here), 'Maps to the Stars' disappointed me. It is far from a terrible film, don't even think it's a bad film, but it for me was a long way from great. Much to admire but do have to share some of the criticisms here, a great concept with inconsistent execution of it. As far as Cronenberg's work goes, 'Maps to the Stars' is better than 'Stereo', 'Crimes of the Future' and 'Cosmopolis' but it is a lesser film of his, nowhere near the level of 'The Fly', 'Dead Ringers', 'Eastern Promises', 'A History of Violence' and 'Spider'.There are good things with 'Maps to the Stars'. It looks wonderful, excepting the somewhat fake-looking fire, then again it is Cronenberg whose work from the late 1970s onwards always ranked high on a visual level (of his overall output 'Rabid' and 'Shivers' were the only real exceptions in this regard). The cinematography is stylish and quite stunning to look at, sunshine has rarely blazed in such a wonderfully dazzling way in film. Shore's score is subtly unsettling and Cronenberg does deliver in the visual aspect of his directing.Some of the satire is fiercely sharp and darkly funny and it is the satire where 'Maps to the Stars' fares best. Really admired the cast here, with Moore being excellent in the lead in her best performance in years (perhaps since 'Boogie Nights'). Evan Bird shows himself to be a young actor with huge potential, a very beyond his years performance. Have not seen a better performance from Mia Wasikowska in her most daring role and she is very affecting in it, seeing John Cusack and Olivia Williams in different roles and excelling was great to see. Robert Pattinson is much better than he was in 'Cosmopolis' and as others have said he has come on a long way since 'Twilight'.For all those great things, 'Maps to the Stars' just didn't connect with me. Despite a promising start, there is a major change of tone that jars badly and then the film becomes unfocused and rather strange. The satirical edge is done well, but the vulgarity does get very over-the-top and mean-spirited and the cynical edge is overdone at times too. The more surreal elements didn't come over as either dreamlike or nightmarish, not much eerie here, too much of the scenes veered on ridiculous and felt very hokey. Emotionally, 'Maps to the Stars' should have been poignant but it felt too cold and clinical (Cronenberg's direction on the most part is the same). The pace can drag and with the trimming or excision of scenes that felt like padding that added nothing it would have felt much better. Cronenberg can do weird and disturbing very well, evident when he pioneered body horror, but very rarely to to such kitchen-sink or muddled effect.Didn't feel for any of the characters apart from disgust, am aware they were not meant to be likeable and be unpleasant but the film failed too to make them properly fleshed out. The only character who came close to evoking any sympathy from me was Agatha, then her true colours were revealed and that was lost. Found that the film tried to do too many things and have too many strands and elements, and too many of them were given short shrift (the Cusack and Olivia Williams subplot was severely under-explored) or became convoluted, with too many things leaving the viewer perplexed due to being unexplained or poorly resolved. The script is not as rambling or bloated as that for 'Cosmopolis' but it is the most gratuitously crass script of any Cronenberg film and never sounds natural. The ending felt tacked on.Altogether, not my cup of tea sadly but did find still a good number of great things about it. 5/10"
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,1,Absolutely terrible-dumb-stupid and nothing good about it (1 viewing)
" Not the Player
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,2,"Map of the Stars demonstrates that David Cronenberg has really gone off the boil. This is a poorly made drama that classes itself as satire but is not remotely funny.Agatha Weiss (Mia Wasikowska) is a scarred young woman who has arrived in Hollywood after leaving a psychiatric ward. Her brother is teenage brat Hollywood actor Benjie Weiss who has just done rehab. Both siblings have a troubled past.Benjie is managed by his mother and their father Dr Stafford Weiss (John Cusack) is a shrink to the stars.One of Dr Weiss's patient's is a troubled ageing actress Havana Segrand (Julianne Moore.) She lives a life of casual sex, chasing that one last big part and having hallucinatory talks with her mother who died in a fire. Havana hires Agatha as an assistant after Carrie Fisher's recommendation.I think Cronenberg wanted to show the shallow incestuous weird dark world of Hollywood full of selfish grotesque people. I think we already knew that. The film offers nothing new to say, what is does say is mediocre."
" Lynch-Lite
",2019-05-06 00:00:00,6,Imagine if Mulholland Drive was a very average film with no great mystery as to what is going on.You just imagined Maps To The Stars.
" Yes, these stars are disgusting and that is the point
",2019-03-19 00:00:00,7,"Americans do not understand satire. I enjoy satires, including black comedies like ""American Psycho,"" but did not see a lot of the humor in this one until my second viewing.The comment about ""stretch limo"" was an in-joke referring to Pattinson in ""Cosmopolis,"" I suppose. I didn't see that one.Casting John Cusack in this one is also an in-joke, since he comes from a showbiz family and has appeared in many films with his sister Joan. I also think I know which incestuous self-help guru Stafford Weiss is supposed to be.Took me a while to recall that Olivia Williams appeared in ""The Sixth Sense,"" where she was surrounded by ghosts but did not see them.We start by seeing Hollywood as an outsider, as most of us are. The girl getting off a bus, the driver who wants to be an actor-writer, and the girl dying of non-Hodgson's lymphoma who wants a visit from her favorite celebrity. These people look up to Hollywood stars.Then we start getting peeks behind the curtain. The kid star Benjie is a foul-mouthed a**hole who's already gone through drug rehab at age 13. Shallow, vulgar teens at parties. Insecure, aging star Havanna Segrand who's fueled by countless drugs and sees the ghost of the mother who molested her.Benjie also sees ghosts, of dead kids, and kills the kid he's jealous of while seeing one. His parents are more concerned about Benjie getting pulled from the film and what the press will say than they are about Benjie's mental health or the kid he killed.Havanna starts dancing, happy that she got a role after a kid died. The polished tv interview given by the movie star is immediately followed by a scene of her sitting on the toilet, making her personal assistant Agatha witness her smelly, farting constipation. She is so jealous of the younger, deformed Agatha's love interest, Jerome, that she has to f**k him herself.Yes, these people are disgusting. I didn't notice until the second viewing, which object Agatha used to kill Havanna; it looked like her mother's Golden Globe statue. Before the end of the movie, I'm rooting for Agatha to kill them all off. Better that way.And that's before factoring in the incest-brother-sister incest and mother-daughter incest. Sick on top of disgusting. Hollywood is a shallow, sick, disgusting, and incestuous world.And yet, so many people are eager to peek behind the curtain, to get a 'map to the stars.' Lots of tabloids and magazines exist to do this. Because these people are beautiful, famous, and rich, their lives must be better than ours? I didn't even care how gorgeous their houses are-straight out of Architectural Digest-because the people who live in them are so twisted. And yet, it's probably better to be twisted in a nice house than twisted and in danger of becoming homeless because landlords keep jacking up the rent.Oh right, we put these stars up on a pedestal because they give us an entertaining distraction from our own small, dull lives. And who doesn't worship beauty. But we'd be much better off admiring beautiful actions rather than beautiful faces, which are maintained at the expense of everything in life that matters.Look at all the dead children. There are so many dead children. I come from publishing, which is also an incestuous insider's world and we have a saying, ""Publishing eats its young."" Hollywood also eats its young. It would be nice to see an updated version of ""Maps"" that incorporates the recent revelations of child sexual abuse and the #MeToo stories in Hollywood.This film came out in 2014, the same year as that other film of Hollywood looking at itself, ""Birdman."" But ""Birdman"" was too incestuous in that it made sense only to insiders and not to us, the audience. ""Maps"" is much better. At least some of the disgusting characters died at the end.Even the people who did not grasp the satire of ""Maps"" did get its main point loud and clear: we should NOT admire these sick and disgusting people. Let us admire their work and then leave them alone to live their own lives. And live our own lives."
" I finally understood Hollywood
",2019-02-13 00:00:00,7,"It is a revelation of how effed up Hollywood and entertainment industry is. Pill popping, shrinks driven ""community"", raising even more messed up children than themselves, living in beautiful overpriced homes behind tall walls, looking helluva good while shopping on Rodeo Drive and screaming and crying in privacy of their own homes. Excellent performance by Moore."
" Watch This If You Enjoy...
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,1,"Watch this if you enjoy seeing Julianne Moore farting on the toilet, Robert Pattinson and Carrie Fisher doing absolutely nothing, Evan Bird as a twinky child star who spews vile dialog and shoots his best friend's dog (and why doesn't he have any shoulders?), John Cusack as a psychologist who sired 2 children with his sister, Jonathan Watton sitting naked in a chair playing with himself as he watches Julianne have sex with another woman, and Mia Wasikowska as a murdering schizophrenic burn victim.All in all, just another warped pile of garbage out of Hollywood. Disgusting dialog, full-frontal nudity, morally corrupt families; it's all here. If you enjoy this movie, you're just as warped as those who are responsible for this crap."
" Horrible movie
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,2,"Cronenberg is an immensely talented man who makes the sickest movies that I can think of. When they work, they work very well, when they don't, they come out like this terrible, terrible disturbing mess. I confess that I couldn't stop watching it, but it upset me on many levels. The acting is excellent as in most Cronenberg films (Julianne Moore is a standout, but when isn't she), but I hope I can get this movie out of my system soon."
" It's a Cronenberg film!
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,7,"Why this is listed as a comedy I don't understand. I found nothing comedic about it whatsoever. Anyone who watches films know that David Cronenberg is a horror director, and this is a horror film. It's not like your typical horror film, where the monster looks obviously like a monster. This is a story about the monsters out there who are human, but inside they are very different from the average person. They attack without warning because people don't realize they are monsters until too late."
" a look at how fake hollywood is
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,1,"Review: I struggled with this movie because there are pieces I like a pieces I don't like. The direction I didn't like, the screenplay I didn't like either, but the concept I loved because it shows you how fake Hollywood is and what people will do to stay relevant. The casting I really liked and the acting was sub-par. All in all I would give this a star out of a possible five stars."
" Give me a map so I can find my way out of this!
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,3,"This is immoral reprehensible trash that had no business being made into a film. No wonder it only grossed $347,648.00! Everything is based on some type of reality and I pray to God that the writer was exaggerating to the nth degree because if any of this is even remotely close to the truth then Hollywood is the true definition of evil. I mean we've all heard and read stories but if this movie is more fact than fiction that is terrifying. How can these people have sold their souls to such a depraved degree? Julianne Moore's character literally dances and sings when she gets news that a fellow actor's child dies from a drowning accident because it now means she will get the starring role she coveted due to the mother's obvious grief. Sick!Robert Pattinson is wasted in this role. He's not the best actor but times must have been hard when he took this part; either that or his agent talked this film up by saying how amazing it would be for him to add this to his cv. In hindsight I'm guessing he would prefer to forget this ever happened. His character was a fame driven piece of sh#! He took advantage of an obviously troubled girl simply for writing material. And then when the first offer of sex comes along from someone else he does it without hesitation. I kept expecting him to tell Julianne Moore's character to shut up or stop the car and tell her to get out but instead he was just a weak coward. What an idiot to think that Julianne Moore's character would've spent two more seconds with his inconsequential ass once she got off on being desired by someone - anyone to make her old ass feel relevant again. Awful!John Cusack is just gross. All he plays anymore is depraved sick characters. His hair is getting further and further back from his forehead to the point of distraction. I wish he'd take a risk by either getting hair implants or shaving it off. Anything would be better than what he's got going on. He's so hard to look at. It's to the point where all you see is John Cusack the person and not the characters he portrays. And another thing-what is up with these actors who refuse to fix their terrible teeth. His bottom row of teeth should have their own billing. He looks like a rodent. I mean I'm all for owning what you got but if you choose to be in film then your face is your fortune. You don't have to go crazy but at least fix the stuff that's distracting. Why won't he fix them?! Gaaaa!!! So irritating! His character is so messed up it would take days to deconstruct what he's got going on. No wonder the kids were so effed up. He was like Satan himself. Exploiting people and constantly looking for ways to spin things in his favor to continue to be bankable. He is counseling people when he's MARRIED TO HIS SISTER?! WTF?! When he was in his car talking to someone on the phone about how he would spin the whole incest thing it was like he was talking about a business issue that needed to be solved. There was no angst or anything - just ""Oh we'll just do this and that and it'll be fine and our fortune will not only be safe - we'll actually get richer off this."" Sick! Oh and did anyone else think he kind of hesitated before finally helping his sister/wife when she set herself on fire (so fake looking). I mean he could have jumped on her and pushed her into the pool to help her right away. Instead she burns to death and then he pushes her in the pool...with a chair! Then he doesn't even pull her out of the pool or call 911. He just lays down on a lounge chair and does nothing. But I love that his son takes his wedding ring off him in that moment and doesn't even ask what's wrong with his obviously troubled dad. Nor does he know his mom is in the pool! That showed the epitome of a self-centered spoiled child. Served the parents right as they were the ones who made him that way by enabling his atrocious behavior.And as far as that child actor...he was terrible! So wooden! His acne was distracting and I can't tell if they meant it to be there to help portray his age or if they just did a bad job in the makeup department of covering it up. His head was so distracting. It's like they stretched his neck as far as they could and then stuck his head on top. Kind of like those Stretch Armstrong Dolls from back in the day or Gumbie. Where'd they dig him up from? I mean there were some heavy hitters in this film and then him. The whole time I'm thinking who slept with whom to get him that part?! In the one scene where he was playing with a gun I was hoping so much he would've shot himself. Instead they have him shoot and kill the innocent dog! If they were trying to portray how these awful people mess up everything around them even innocent animals then I guess they got something right because that was terrible! This role would have been much better in another actor's hands. Is it a surprise to anyone that he hasn't acted since that film? One can only hope he was so scarred from that experience that he got the hell out of Dodge without so much as a backwards glance and is now living out his life as a normal child. But if not let's hope he's been taking all this time off to get acting lessons, dental work, a new hairstyle, appointments with dermatologists and undergoing experimental surgery that will shorten his neck and give his head some shape.The mom character didn't have a lot to work with. Just sobbing and looking mean throughout the film. And did she really have to be naked for that crying scene in the bathtub? Absolutely not! The director was pry like ""Well...this ship is sinking fast so how bout we have her be naked? Her nipples are pretty weird looking so that ought to distract viewers a little bit from how awful this film is."" These actresses need to really examine if being naked in a role is truly necessary or if it's simply gratuitous. If this is the one and only film this actress decided to bare all in...I think she chose poorly.The one thing I did like was the one kid who was a friend to the child star. He was only in a few scenes but he was very good in those. I hope he gets more roles. He appears to have what it takes for a longer career.The sister did a good job with her role. Although morbid-it was actually rewarding when she bashed Julianne Moore's character's head in with her own award. That was priceless! That was one thing the writers got right. She was so awful. She used that troubled girl for her own selfish vain purposes (going so far as to ""steal"" away the guy this naive girl had confided in her about while humiliatingly subjecting her to watching her poop!) and then just turned on her in such a nasty mean way - she deserved to be knocked out.I won't be able to forget this movie but not for the right reasons. Do yourself a favor and pass on this Maps of the Stars ""Tour"". There are much better attractions out there."
" home turf
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,6,"When I see a film by a great director that's specifically about the world of his own profession, I get the hope that he may hit it out of the park. This movie falls considerably short of that, but it is still good."
" A dark satire that forsakes the satiric elements midway through
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,7,"I watched this because I remember it coming out the year that Julianne Moore won her Oscar for the other film she was in (Still Alice). I also distinctly remember this being in the comedy/musical category of the Golden Globes, but wait, this film is directed by David Cronenberg?! Did he decide to mix things up and direct a light-hearted comedy? Nope, this is a macabre, twisted story and the Hollywood Foreign Press got it wrong as usual.This film is extremely similar tonally to both Robert Altman's The Player and David Lynch's Mullholland Drive in deriving not just satire but genuine horror at the shallowness that pervades Hollywood life. Julianne Moore plays a has-been actress who isn't necessarily malicious but she's pretty soulless in her desperate quest for relevance. She's paralleled by a self-help guru, played by John Cusack, who's son (Evan Bird) is an extremely bratty child actor. There's also an opportunistic burn victim who represents the ingeneue looking to make her mark on Hollywood (think Ruby Keeler in 42nd Street if she chanted Wiccan prayers whenever she passed along the Hollywood Walk of Fame). The only halfway decent character might be the limo driver played by Robert Pattinson although he strikes one as a little blank. There's also a Hollywood director who will trade parts for sex, an entire clique of vapid child stars who enable Evan Bird's character, and equally shallow rivals.Like ""The Player"" which shifts gears midway from its broad ensemble satire to the perfect crime; or ""Mullholland Drive"" which segues to a Lesbian love story than a mobius strip; this film's satirical elements get overwhelmed midway for a more gruesome tragedy which makes the ending feel like something that's been tacked on to cover a superfluous detour from what was originally a better film."
" Maps to the Stars
",2018-06-16 00:00:00,6,"I didn't know much about this film before reading about it, to be honest, I just remembered the title and that critics gave it positive reviews, so that was enough for me to give it a try, directed by David Cronenberg (Scanners, Videodrome, The Fly). Basically the Weiss family are current Hollywood royalty, father Dr. Stafford Weiss (John Cusack) is a celebrity psychotherapist to the stars, but more famous than him seems to be his bad boy thirteen-year-old son Benjie (Evan Bird), star of the hit movie Bad Babysitter. The sequel is currently filming, it is a comeback of sorts for Benjie, following his stint in drug rehab, his career is managed by his mother Christina (Olivia Williams), she is also Hollywood royalty herself, her actress mother Clarice Taggart (Sarah Gadon) died years ago in a house fire. Havana Segrand (Julianne Moore) is a middle-aged actress past her prime, she is hoping to remake the movie Stolen Waters, playing the role made famous by her own mother, also Clarice, who received an Oscar nomination. Havana has been spending time in therapy, as she felt that Clarice abused her, and she has haunting visions of her mother, but Havana also has emotional issues related to her declining career and how she is now perceived in Hollywood. Through a loose connection with Carrie Fisher, Havana hires new Hollywood arrival Agatha (Mia Wasikowska) as her personal assistant, Agatha has severe burn scars across her face and body that she tries to cover up. Agatha begins a friendship and possible relationship with an aspiring actor and writer Jerome Fontana (Robert Pattinson), he is working as a limousine driver until he gets his big break, he uses whatever life experience to work on his movie career. Agatha is in fact part of the Weiss family, she is schizophrenic and has returned from a sanatorium, she was the person who set the house on fire that killed Clarice, so for years Benjie has wanted nothing to do with her. In the end, after many issues are brought out into the open between the characters, Havana humiliates Agatha until she beats the actress to death with one of her own awards, Cristina is set on fire near the swimming pool and Stafford is left in a catatonic state, Benjie and Agatha reunite at the ruins of their old home that burned down, and they commit suicide together taking an extreme amount of pills together, before lying down to watch the stars. Also starring Kiara Glasco as Cammy. Moore is excellent as the faded star wanting to regain her stardom, Bird is great as the Justin Bieber like child diva, and there is terrific support from Wasikowska, Williams and Cusack. This is definitely in the same vibe of movies looking at the dark side of Hollywood, like Mommie Dearest and Sunset Boulevard, it is poignant, surreal and twisted, a fascinating and interesting satirical drama. Good!"
" An master class in dark satirical drama.
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,9,"This is Cronenberg at his finest form. Follow his deftly acted palette of characters down their kaleidescopic downward spiral in this self-reflective piece about the steep personal prices of Hollywood. Julianne Moore, John Cusack and Olivia Williams are all in peak form. Relative newcomer Mia Wasikowska delivers a delicately handled career-high performance. Robert Pattinson delivers another solid performance the likes of his efforts in Water for Elephants and The Rover. All round, a superbly poignant sort of dramatic social commentary, if, at that, a disturbing one."
" Huh?
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,5,"Not that I didn't know what was going on. But I was lost on Cronenberg's intent or message.Was it a critique of Hollywood? An examination of mental illness? Or just a day in the life of a few people?None of the characters really went through a change.I wasn't sure that Julianne Moore's supposed molestation from her own mother was real or not. The visits from her mother were valid if it was real, but nothing really came of them. Also, I didn't see any competency with her character in regards to acting. I would've been curious how an insane person like her then can function and produce as an actress. Of course Moore is a premiere actress but felt she was having trouble with the role.The character of the 13-year-old movie star played by Evan Bird was interesting but felt disjointed as it was written for a character a few years older. A lot to work with and Bird did a very good job for his age. But the initial meeting with him was very odd as it sounded like he was badly dubbed with an adult voice. The character was consistent throughout but really didn't seem like he was mentally ill, which apparently he was in the final scene. Sure, he was a major asshole but not crazy. The little girl from the opening scene visiting him after her death didn't work. Didn't see a reason why vs. Moore's mother visiting her. It was just more of the same. And who was the little boy in the pool? The kid that supposedly drowned (off camera) but Bird's character never crossed paths with?Mia Wasikowska's character also didn't seem crazy 'til she conveniently stopped taking her meds for no real reason (other than to provide for the final act). If she was star-struck, the character didn't reach that. Very much in a gray area and not really committed to anything.If anyone was a critique of Hollywood, it was Pattinson's character who just floated through the piece as very naive.And finally Cusack and Williams as the couple who didn't initially know they were brother and sister. That element had no exploration and there was no real place the film landed in judgment. Was Cusack suppose to be a phony guru? Thought so but the early scene with Moore was essentially authentic.As for William's tortured mother, I wasn't sure why. Was all the weirdness catching up to her after all these years? I could see it if she was like that after her little boy almost killed the child. But before? Not really. And suicide by fire? Seemed like something just to stay in-line with the previous fire elements. (And the CGI fire was very fake.)In the end, I thought it was very self-indulgent. But even that was not prevalent enough."
" A bizarre look at Hollywood
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,8,I haven't watched other movies by David Cronenberg but if people say that this one is the weakest one of his work then I have to watch more of his movies. This is a very bizarre look at Hollywood. Making the glamorous life look kind of miserable. The incest topic is pretty horrifying especially when we see how the characters are all dealing with it and the mental sickness that came with it.The cast is of very high class actors and they all do an amazing performance in the movie. Agatha Weiss is most impressive character and Mia Wasikowska does a great job portraying her with her vulnerability and mental problems. Julianne Moore also does an amazing job as an actress trying to make a comeback in a remake playing a role of her mother who molested her. Evan Bird does a very impressive performance for such a young actor portraying a teen star whose environment got him into being a nasty person and a drug abuser at a very young age yet we also see his pain that makes us feel for the young man.Glad I found this movie.
" Depressing, full of miserable and unlikable characters
",2017-11-21 00:00:00,4,"OMG - I don't know why I rented this film, but I didn't like it. Directed by David Cronenberg, ""Maps to the Stars"" from 2014 is about the seamier side of Hollywood. Believe me, after you see this, you'll have no interest in any side of Hollywood.The story deals with several different people. Stafford Weiss (John Cusack) is psychotherapist to the stars. He and his wife (Olivia Williams) share several secrets. Their teenage son, Benjie (Evan Bird), is a big star, totally obnoxious, and a drug addict, who refers to his assistant as a ""Jew faggot."" Now, someone on IMDb thought this kid was not totally unlikable. I did. Benjie has a sister, Agatha, who has been gone from the family for 7 years, under mysterious circumstances, after she set fire to the house. She actually is back in LA, at first unbeknownst to them, with a lot of burns on her body, working as a personal assistant to Havana Segrand (Julianne Moore). Havana's mother was a big star who died in a fire, so apparently, Havana feels connected to Agatha. Havana is an over-the-hill actress who wants to play her mother's role in a remake of one of her movies. Someone else is cast, but when that woman's little boy drowns, Agatha is thrilled. Agatha believes her mother abused her, and is in therapy with Stafford Weiss.Robert Pattinson plays an actor who works as a chauffeur. He's also writing a screenplay.After dealing with the drugs, the insults, the descriptions of what actresses let producers do to them to get roles, the threesome, the incest, the visions of dead children, etc., I was ready to slit my wrists.I'm sure Cronenberg fans will find plenty to enjoy here. I was left wondering why I watched it."
" Hollywood problems
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,6,"Daivd Cronenberg's 'Maps to the Stars' tells the convergent stories of several different characters in Hollywood: at first it appears as if this is one of those films about discrete lives that form a fine web of faint touches, but in fact it turns out that (most) of the characters have serious history, and are coming back together after events that have driven them apart. This reveal is quite well-plotted; the problem is that the characters are all mostly nasty (or at the very least weird), and moreover are so in a uniquely Hollywood way - you can believe there are such people in and around the movie business, but they're simply not the sort of people that most of us meet in our everyday lives. This makes it quite hard to sympathise with them, even if we can see the reason for their meanness and oddness. Cronenberg's movies can be considered cold in general, and although the charge isn't always justified, I watched this one very much from the outside. One thing it isn't, in spite of its billing as such, is a comedy."
" Cronenberg's Dark...Very Dark...Kind-of Comedy
",2017-05-16 00:00:00,7,"A slight departure for Cronenberg, but his unflinching style to delve into the darkness of psychosis is still prevalent. Intertwining stories revolving around the shallow lust for fame in Hollywood. Julianne Moore turns in her usual terrific performance as an actress looking to make a comeback in a biopic of her late cult-star mother. Other performances are solid, as well. The humor is cynical, the script is taut and brings out the depth...or lack of...in each character. Recommended."
