" Surprisingly great
",2021-03-30 00:00:00,8,This is a very original and clever film. You can guess the entire time what is happening and probably still not figure it out. You will figure out the twist at the ending.
" Fun
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,7,"Very imaginative. Probably more clever than deep. It could have been fleshed out more, but what's there is pretty fun!"
" Slow start
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,7,It started slow but about 20 minutes in it gets good. Definitely keeps your attention. I think part of the problem for me is knowing Mark Duplass (Ethan) from Goliath. His role in Goliath kinda freaked me out.
" Left with a case of ""the bends""!
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,1,"Decompression Sickness also known as ""The Bends"" is what occurs when a scuba diver ascends to the surface too quickly after a dive! That's exactly what happened during this movie!!! The acting is great, don't get me wrong there. But while watching this movie, I had an idea of where it was going and the longer the movie went, the deeper I ""dove"" into the story! Then all of a sudden you are jerked back to the shallow water to discover this is a sci-fi film with little to no meaning at all. Just someone with an ability to kidnap people with no explanation as to how it is done! I understand this might be some peoples cup of tea... but not mine, if you don't enjoy shallow sci-fi films, don't waste your time on this one!"
" Can't believe I sat through this.
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,2,"I stumbled across this dud after doing a search for best streaming sci-fi movies, hoping to find a lost gem I have overlooked. Now I see why it was overlooked."
" Duplass, Moss, Danson
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,4,"Since this film got such high marks, I am reluctant to give my poor opinion but here goes. I paid 4 bucks for this rental. I could not finish watching it. I am single that might have something to do with it. I left the problems of marriage 30 some years ago. Talking to lost selves to reinvigorate a doomed relationship would never have worked. I enjoyed Dinner With Andre and other close up conversational films, but two people talking to two lost versions of themselves is claustrophobic. The set was a small hedged in little house by more hedges and a pool. The fantasy could have been done and over with in ten minutes not 90. Moss and Duplass have acting abilities that a script with more levels of new insight into their troubled relationship could have worked. For example, after confronting their lost selves the careers they wanted but now have could be dealt with. The children they didn't have and wanted. The life visions that are at odds. The inlaws... Religion. Friends. A fascinating mix of other ideas could make this couple see that the union is not what they expected. They feel as stuck together as I felt watching them."
" Underrated for sure. Must watch.
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,10,"This movie left us in such an... uncomfortable state the entire time we were watching it. You understand both sides of the spectrum so it's hard to choose what it is you would do. I will say, I expected the ending while my gf didn't. Cinematic masterpiece for sure."
" O yeah .. a twilight zone tribute...
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,8,"Ted Danson is a shrink who sends a troubled couple (Sophie & Ethan) to a weekend getaway that, he assures them, will help them resolve their marital problems. At first, one of the couple manifest better relationship skills, while the other reverts to form. Then visa versa. What can be happening?Those of us who grew up watching TWILIGHT ZONE 60 years ago would recognize the dramatic 'device' unfolding. This is an excellent take on that premise, with more time for twists/turns in a full-length movie. Some unneeded bad language & a couple of make-out scenes. Sorry- no spoilers here. Enjoy. 8/10"
" Interesting idea but less than optimal execution
",2021-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Could be a lot faster at the beginning. Lacks the answers, too"
" Great movie.
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,9,"Sometimes We need such a simple fix, but We never receive it from our partner and don't know how to ask for it, making us stuck in endless loops of avoidance. It comes from a choice of not working on ourselves and on blaming our partner or something else. Once You focus on what's within, You will have nothing else to focus on or to complain about. You will save the relationship and yourself.
You either both heal inside and help heal each other, or You choose distractions and use each other.
This movie sends a lot of messages without the use of much dialogue. If You get triggered from it, then You should put prideful emotion aside and admit You have healing to do."
" Has potential
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,6,"A couple with marital issues sees a therapist who suggests a getaway weekend to mend their relationship. However when they get there, they notice that someone lives in the guest house that looks identical to them. The husband is just a cooler, more handsome version. The wife falls in love with the fake version of her husband. At the end, they are locked up in the house and realise only two of the four people can leave.The premise of the movie is certainly an interesting one and I liked where it was going. I rated it relatively low because it was in parts quite inconsistent with no explanation provided as to who their look-a-likes are and what the point of it all was. Was their therapist evil or genuinely trying to help them? I would have liked a bit of a background story or at the very least a subplot. This movie would have worked better as a short TV series. The ending of the husband getting home with the wrong wife was predictable. The idea is creative and has potential, but the movie was quite average overall."
" Great concept, poor ending.
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,7,"Ethan (Mark Duplass) and Sophie (Elizabeth Moss) are in marriage counseling after Ethan cheated on Sophie. The therapist (Ted Danson) suggests going on a weekend getaway to a remote estate, claiming that every couple who went there came back ""renewed.""Exploring the estate, Ethan and Sophie separately discover something odd about the guest house. Each spends time there without the other and, while Sophie ostensibly thinks their experiences in the guest house will save their marriage, Ethan sees the inexplicable and immediately becomes suspicious.The ensuing disagreement about whether the guest house experiences are beneficial or harmful (and possibly dangerous) begin to break down the fragile connection they have remaining.And just when you think you know what's going on, it changes. And that's where the writers dropped the ball and provided a thoroughly predictable ending. This would have been a fantastic science fiction story, but it wasn't."
" What a twist!
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,9,"I would never imagine something like that would come, very unique plot. I have never felt bored while watching, great movie."
" The One I Love **Mild Spoilers**
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,8,"This film has been on my Netflix watchlist for a year or so, and finally out of things to watch I popped it on. No hyping myself up for this, no further research, just a random movie that sounded interesting and has Mark Duplass in it. What I got was a surprisingly well-made film for what felt like a ""bottle episode"" production. One main set piece with 2 very good actors playing off each. Elisabeth Moss and Mark Duplass have great chemistry, even in scenes where they are supposed to be at each other's throats. What surprised me more was how they were able to convey acting the same characters, only more idealized versions.The story is pretty good for what amounts to a Twilight Zone extended episode, which I know sounds like a backhanded compliment. However, once you are fully invested in the story and the rules the writer has set, you can hear that eerie opening music and Rod Serling welcoming you. From what I read after watching the film there was a 50-page outline of the story but the dialog was mostly improvised. You really can't tell because Moss and Duplass are selling this messed up married couple. Outside of one egregious muck up one of the characters made, a lot of the fights feel like ones I've had with my wife.Equally impressive was the shots where they had doubles in the frame and it still looked to be handheld over a steady camera. Of course, this could've been achieved in post but still impressive nonetheless. The camera work highlights the difference between the main house and guest house which helps to cut down on the confusion later on in the movie.If I had to nitpick aspects of the story, though, one would be shrugging off the main twist to the film. While I get it would bog down the story, and you would have to start answering a lot of questions the film leaves open, a little more clarity would've helped, if not more defined rules. The next would be close to the end the story felt like it was dragging some.However, those flaws didn't ruin my overall enjoyment of the film. I can't wait to check out other films made by the director and writer (Charlie McDowell and Justin Lader respectfully) and I highly recommend this movie. 8 out 10, closer to a 9 than a 7 if that helps."
" Fun concept... for a Twilight Zone episode.
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,6,"It does get some for a good performance from Elizabeth Moss. The writing is also pretty well done, though this could have totally been a shorter Twilight Zone episode; it tends to drag on a bit after a while. It's not bad at all but ultimately feels a bit unsatisfying as we don't quite get the point (at least I didn't)."
" On the other side, I thought we could see it all and understand why. love.
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,9,"Every review is so awesome interpretation of their version of love and relationship. Ultimately people have soft corner for theses nowhere to go movies and it gives us so much feeling of content that we could relate to these things.
These type of movies give meaning to everything that is forgettable in our life, things like cuddling on couch and brushing teeth together and reading quietly together without noticing each other. These things too make life and that is what this movie tell us in a way. I hope people only get inspired watching theses and make more still life movies.
But the most important fact that it felt nowhere near boring at any point but only we get attached to the character and want to watch it till the end. Everypart of relationship is not covered in this movie but some one those things are so meaningful and subtle and profound that we should try to embrace this little circle of life."
" A one-of-a-kind Rom-Com.
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,8,"The One I Love is genuinely one of the most interesting films I have watched. The basic plot follows Ethan and Sophie, a married couple who is having a rough time in their relationship. A marriage counselor suggests that they should go on a retreat to a luxury villa on the country side, to spend a weekend clearing their minds and becoming closer. Once they get there, they realize that inside the guest house lies the idealized version of their partner, but they can only see them one at a time. Later, it is revealed that they walked into a trap, and that the only way out was to impersonate the next couple that came along, drivign them apart, and leaving with the other partner. Mark Duplass and Elizabeth Moss are fantastic in this role, and they carry this movie to a much more elevated rom-com. There are only three actors in this movie, with Mark Duplass and Elizabeth Moss playing the clones of their respective characters, and Ted Danson playing the marriage counselor. The whole movie feels like an elevated episode of the Twilight Zone. It's compelling, it's unique, it's a mystery, a drama, and a comedy, all rolled into one. The ending leaves you off wondering what might have happened, and is a solid way to end a movie like this. I have very few complaints for this movie, it's very well done. The story is simple, but with that twist that makes it more interesting. But at it's core, Ethan and Sophie are a deeply developed pair, and the writing of the story is just phonomenal. It says a lot in the relationship when your partner is constantly going to the ""better"" version of yourself, and it's interesting to see how both Ethan and Sophie handle knowing that they were not talking to their real partner. The characters act like normal people, they aren't super psyched out about what's happening, but they are still curious in some respects. The description of the movie on Netflix gives nothing away about the plot, so it is genuinely a twist when you see what is really going on. It's very well done, and I have little complaints for this movie."
" It's barely 4 star-worthy.
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,4,"It's the plot and the characters- basically the writing that I dislike so much. I really don't like movies or shows where reality is eliminated and perhaps that is why I just couldn't get into it. I watched/suffered through the whole thing.
I see that some folks loved it, but for me. It wasn't my type of show.
YMMV"
" Brilliant thought-provoking romantic Sc-Fi
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,10,"A couple hope to improve they're marriage on a vacation and realize some weird other dimension! Perfectly awkward, sweet, well written, and ambient soundtrack which I love. I wasn't sure what to expect from The One I Love but I enjoy it a lot especially the menacing factor that's in part of it! Quite a pleasant treat I highly recommend to anyone."
" Plot twist meets romantic comedy to mediocre results.
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,3,"I was excited to watch this, thinking it was a bit of a coherence type flick with some romcom thrown in.The real sin here is not knowing how to establish that key relationship from the get go. We don't get the impression their marriage is on the rocks, there's no passion for sure, but that's as a result of the flat dialog and 30 seconds spent showing them interacting.Then we're supposed to believe that a couple on the brink of divorce would a) bring weed to a retreat b) drink non stop c) act like horny teens d) reminisce all the MDMA they took at lollapalooza. News flash, when a couple tanks, it's usually because these things DO NOT happen, at least one side of the marriage think they have 'grown out of it'. Not here. So ... why are they in that place again?This is a movie that doesn't know what it wants to be - even the music sound equivalently 'scary' and 'goofy'. SFX are overbearing at times and always noticeable, which is distracting.Welcome to 'dramedies', i guess."
" Don't read the other reviews - Just watch it !!!!!!!!
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,10,"Reading some of the other reviews about this film will spoil the fun. Instead, trust me and just watch this film and enjoy two great actors at the top of their game. Outstanding. Elizabeth Moss has to be one of the most engaging and versatile actresses ever. Mark Duplass, I had not seen so much of but he is great in this film. The story line is unique and entertaining. A rom-com? A thriller? A drama? Suspense? Yes, ticks all of these boxes for me. I really enjoyed this movie immensely."
" The husband was not the least bit interesting
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,1,"Not having seen Mark Duplass prior to this movie, I don't know whether his juvenile, insecure, and unattractive character was due to the actor's actual persona or to the character that he opted to play. That said, because of the husband's deficiencies, I found it jarring that the endearing character played by Elisabeth Moss was actually interested in saving this marriage."
" Beautiful Bizzare Movie
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,7,"Rating: 7I don't know why the movie is tagged as a Romantic Comedy it should definitely be in Mystery as the ending takes a turn. I didn't take this movie up before as I thought it would be a Rom-Com and I am not a fan of that particular genre. But I must say this movie is beautifully written and is undiscovered by so many.The Good - I love the characters, the cinematography, the twist in this movie. Like what a straightforward and placid movie it suddenly does a 180 haha! The movie touches on the themes of married life, love, sorrow, betrayal and what not.The Bad - I want the movie to reach a wider audience and not be an undiscovered underrated gem of a movie. That's the only bad I feel as I want more people to watch this beautiful piece of artwork.This is a must watch movie which though seems like a simple, well laid out romantic drama takes a turn and reveals the true undertone colors!"
" Inventive and fun, but leaves a lot unexplained
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,6,"I hate spoilers, but at the same time believe a viewer must be warned that no full explanation will be given in the end. There is a sense of resolution and a message, which wrap-up this well made and entertaining shot two-hander, just I would enjoy a bit more explanation as even with all the fun twists and quirky humour it might seem the creators wrote themselves into a corner."
" Men will see the movie one way, women will see it another, but both will leave with a better understanding of the other's perspective
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,8,"A forehead-wrinkling bit of relationship fantasy that'll stick in your teeth for days. I found a lot of thematic similarities between this one and Being John Malkovich. Though it's not nearly so dark and grim about it, The One I Love delights in asking similarly deep, puzzling questions about the root of an unhappy relationship and the sense of futility that's so often associated with mending something so broken. Of course, like Malkovich, it's also based around a weird, jolting plot device that skirts explanation for its own benefit. The real allure of that vehicle, of course, isn't with the solemn inspection of its construct, it's with the games it directs with the main players. Usually I'm the first to complain when such an elephant is left ignored in the back of the room, but in this case (if you'll excuse the string of metaphors) I think it would be a case of missing the forest for the trees. It's not perfect - the false-finish is telegraphed and the second act sags at times - but it deserves praise for trying something so fresh, and for evenly exploring both sides of the central relationship. Men will see the movie one way, women will see it another, but both will leave with a better understanding of the other's perspective."
" Your mind will be...BLOWN
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,9,"It appears to be one thing and then it is something completely different. Not a comedy, not a romance. Not true scifi either. These adept filmmakers are in complete control of there craft they know EXACTLY what they are doing. Would love to see more of this kind."
" Premise interrupted
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,6,"An interesting premise, or was it? To my mind, it had the beginning of a unique premise but they didn't work out the how the the premise worked. It didn't have an internal logic. SciFi films don't have to be real but they do have to build (and then be faithful to) an internal structure, which I don't think this did. And, the final twist was entirely predictable. The beginning was boring and poorly written. I thought there was little chemistry between Sophie and Ethan. But the middle was interesting. Not resolving the premise was the problem for me. So, poor beginning, predictable ending without resolving the underlying mystery - I give this film a 6 (fair) out of 10. {SciFi Mystery}"
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,3,"Very intriguing and went in a lot of directions that I didn't expect it to. But overall it disappointed severely. A lot of things made no sense and some things did not even come into play that I expected to. (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
like When he found out that it wasn't the first time she cheated on him . And btw how can she get mad at him for HER cheating on him. I'm fine with them not explaining how things work but they tried to explain some of it, which created more questions that were never answered. They went about 30% of the way with explaining what was actually happening. Why was the therapist involved, what was he getting out of it? Looking at the general way it works, a couple is trapped in the guest house, until the therapist sends a new couple there. At that point the trapped couple gets plastic surgery and voice alterations to look and sound exactly like the new couple (ok sure I'll allow it). Then they learn life details from the therapy sessions. They drive the new couple apart and make them trapped in the guest house in order for the previous couple to leave.ok.....sooooo......huh? how does that make any sense. I'm cool with there being weird magic that can trap you there, or super amazing plastic surgery that can make you look exactly like someone else (even tho some couples were black and different sizes, again, sure i'll allow that). But how does the way the guest house works make any sense at all. Who would want that to happen? For what reason? What is anyone getting out of it? Maybe in some weird way the transformation and escape from the house will make them a stronger couple? No, sorry, I will not allow it. I just wish someone would give me a possible and plausible reason for why the guest house is set up to do what it does. Also he mentioned that it's not possible to get the smell of bacon out that fast. But they never explained that since it ended up being just regular people living there and not ghosts"
" Great Move with Limited Characters
",2019-06-07 00:00:00,8,This was an original concept and the idea alone brings an abundance of great dialogue opportunity. Moments of laughs brought to us by great acting by two of the best. Great movie with limited characters.
" Do we ever tire of man bad movies
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,6,Man Bad man cheat man (hence) man not people. Wo-man angry wo-man have upper hand.
" I saw that ending from a mile off
",2019-05-07 00:00:00,4,I'm not going to say what happens but there was zero surprise for me. It started out with promise but it was just long and drawn out. I would not recommend it.
" ""Why not"" kind of flick
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,7,"Relationship drama in an unsuspecting setting with a sort of futuristic twist leaves a lot to be desired but is so well acted, filmed and thought out that it makes you stay till the very end, even though it is really drawn out and stretched to the max like a pair of old sheer tights over a fat leg. One can argue that certain ideas and scenes could have been given more screen time and/or dedication but hey-ho, I'm not gonna cry myself to sleep.The problem is that you have to sit through and watch until it reaches its conclusion even when you're compelled to leave or take a quick nap because permanent threat of boredom always looming, always quietly creeping up, so yeah, it's difficult to judge.Having said that, props for some original movie making. Can be seen but should it be? Not sure if you'll be missing out if not. It is quite surprising, it does a few turns along the way, so if you have spare 90 minutes to kill.."
" Ending could have been planned better
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,10,"Very captivating movie. ***Spoilers Ahead******
Although I think when Ethan tells Sophie that we should leave in the end, the two Sophies hesitate, which in my opinion was a bit longer. I could immediately tell that it was the fake Sophie who went with Ethan, and the final bacon scene was not very surprising."
" Is there anyone as talented as these two actors?
",2019-03-14 00:00:00,10,"The movie begins with the characters in marriage counseling, which made me kind of groan a bit. I thought to myself, 'no, not another self absorbed gen X or millennial piece of crap.' But it didn't take too long to realize that this movie was taking a wide turn from the average movie. This movie is engaging and highly entertaining. The two leads show an enormous amount of talent, skillfully displaying the different personalities and mannerisms required. (I won't explain why: no spoilers here) The title of this movie is so revealing, but not until you've watched. Which I highly recommend you do."
" Pues la voy a aprobar. Well, I'm going to approve it
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,5,"No porque sea una película estupenda, no, no lo es. No resuelve nada, no da explicaciones, te deja todo en el aire y eso no me gusta, pero sí que hace algo bueno, tiene una buena idea. No la lleva bien a cabo del todo pero la idea en si esta divertida. Es un estudio de las decisiones que toma cada persona delante de una situación, ¿te diviertes o la investigas?Con muy poco dinero ha conseguido hacer una película como de ciencia ficción y eso es bueno
Lo malo es que tiene demasiados campos muy mal.Los actores están geniales. Tienes frases y momentos estupendos.La iluminación es una pena. No da para nada. No te cuenta nada. No te mete en nada.El director, pues bueno por lo menos ha conseguido que me interese la película. No sabe hacer un plano bonito que transmite y cuente pero no me ha aburrido.
Pasas un buen rato.Not because it's a great movie, no, it's not. It does not solve anything, it does not give explanations, it leaves everything in the air and I do not like that, but if it does something good, it has a good idea. It does not take well at all but the idea itself is fun. It is a study of the decisions that each person takes in front of a situation, do you have fun or do you investigate?With very little money he has managed to make a movie like science fiction and that's good
The bad thing is that it has too many fields very badly.The actors are great. You have great phrases and moments.The lighting is a pity. It does not give anything. He does not tell you anything. It does not get you into anything.The director, well at least he has got me interested in the film. He does not know how to make a beautiful shot that transmits and counts but it has not boring me.
You have a good time"

" Great independent film by a new talent
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,7,"This is a great independent feature made for a mere 100,000 dollars and all the great things that come with limited budget is on display here: minimal locations, great cast, fantastic dialogue delivery and great plot. This film is the birth of a great filmmaker in Charlie Mcdowell- Keep an eye out for the lad. (Great independent film by a new talent)"
" Didn't do it for me.
",2018-05-09 00:00:00,5,"I'm not impressed at all by The One I love. Seeing the high ratings it got I was expecting something much better. The story is kinda new but not that really interesting, certainly not for the entire movie. Sometimes a bit confusing if you lose your attention, and it doesn't really come with clear answers at the end, so that's also a major letdown to me. Mark Duplass and Elisabeth Moss are basically they only actors in this movie, or at least for 98%, and I don't know if that was a good thing. Their acting is not bad, it's just the storytelling that is not very captivating. At least not for me, nor my wife. Obviously other people thought it was so maybe you should give it a shot. For me it didn't work."
" Refreshing
",2018-05-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie was unexpected, funny, and thought provoking. The script was great, a different take on a rom-com."
" Offbeat and somewhat amusing
",2017-11-09 00:00:00,6,"This quirky movie is worth a look. Some suspension of disbelief is required. Script is OK but the acting is pretty solid, though having said that, more range in terms of characters' possible selves would have given it more edge. Takes about 20 minutes to take off. No idea what the R rating is for. 15 maybe but the R is hardly justified."
" Weighed down by leaving too many questions not answered
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,6,"6.5, so above average. I'd recommend never reading the reviews for this movie before you watch it. I barely read the description, because I was told ""the less you know, the better"", and it's extremely important for this movie. I think it'll even be boring upon a second watch, now that I don't have to think and guess as I had upon the first. So, major spoilers. You have been warned. I have many complaints and many great things to say about this movie, but like the miserable couple in it, I will focus on the bad parts. So, what I gather from the premise is, there are always one couple in the house/quest house that can't leave, because their relationship is not strong enough. And, when some new couple come visit,(guided by some psychopath Doctor Who-ish therapist) the trapped couple tries to switch places with them. They do so, by taking on an idealized form of the new couple, the female seducing the male and so on... And then, when the new couple's relationship is weakened because the trapped couple's fake personalities appears to be so much more awesome than their partner's, the trapped couple can leave, making the ""new"" couple become the trapped ones instead. This left so many questions, that will frustratingly never be answered. 1) How do the trapped couple shape shift into the idealized forms of the other couple? Is it magic? Quantum mechanics? I don't know, and neither does the movie. 2) So at the end, the male lead realizes that he has escaped with the idealized version of Moss by mistake. He decides to just roll with it, since his original wife coldly and knowingly decided to stay with his fake version - I totally get that. What I don't get is the fake Moss-character's decision to stay with him after she escaped. What's in it for her? She must've gone insane trying to keep up the idealized act forever, given that she is also a real person, who had another life before.3) Related to the one above, are the shape shifting permanent? Do they have permanent fake personalities as well, never being able to reclaim the life they had before? Are they forced to do this, simply because they wanted a better relationship?! 4) What point is the therapist trying to make? After all, all of the couples entering the house/guest house, will have their relationship destroyed, and then be forced to shape shift into a stranger's idea of perfection. They don't get anything fixed, only cruel punishment awaits.Some people say this movie would've been better as a short. I say this movie would've been better as a horror. It was, in fact, recommended to me, because I was searching for a scary movie(damn you, Metafilter, and your ever so tame idea of ""scary stuff""). I'll never forget the creeped out feeling I got when I saw Kate Moss holding a babushka, realizing that this would be about doppelgängers, but sadly not knowing that it was intended to be a drama-mystery- comedy. Thus, I sat there waiting in glee for some revelation of the terrible creatures behind the perfect facades, or some build-up to an incredibly freaky psychological horror. They could've done so much with this! I wish they were aliens or something, with a slow, scary revelation of creepy habits, that would make the couple regret their decisions. Or maybe they could've just played around with the surreal feeling of being with your partner, but not really, and the surreal states and psychology that follows living with a fantastic being, that knows it's not real. Yet the simple concept of the movie stayed as minimalist as it was when it begun. Shame.And one last thing. The Kate Moss-character was surprisingly, well, stupid - the fact that she turned out to be ""right"" in the end didn't prevent me from strongly disliking her, in all her ""but if it feeeeels right""- pretensions. I actually thought what she did was worse than the male character cheating, but most of all, I just couldn't connect with her. She lacked both curiosity and fear in a way I found unbelievable, and I actually understood her shape shifter-version much better."
" Good premise, okay film
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,7,"SPOILER: Mark Duplass and Elizabeth Moss are married and their marriage is on the rocks. Duplass cheated, and they are trying to make things work again. They are seeing therapist Ted Danson, who suggests they take a weekend for themselves at an out of the way resort he knows of. They go and discover that if either of them enter a small guest house on the premises by themselves, another, slightly better version of the other one is in the house. This is a great premise in search of a better movie. What's here is not bad, and in fact, their initial reactions to the set up is quite good. It's the last act that is really not up to it. The film doesn't let the premise remain a mystery. It explains enough to try to ground the film in reality without explaining enough to really make any sense. It's too bad because both Moss and Duplass are great, and what the film does well,in particular grappling with the idea of what you may have lost as the years go by, it does really well."
" Interesting idea, badly executed
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,6,"(Spoiler Alert) 1. What's interesting about this movie is the idea, which is unique, but everything else is nonsense. 2. The main idea is good. However, the other sideline stories are so bad that you lose interest in the whole movie. 3. The movie seriously needed more twists and interesting story lines, but it feels like the writer didn't care much. 4. Also such movies need more intimate feelings and synergy, but the actors were seriously like imitating for kids, not in a serious movie. 5. The revelation of the story was bad, it could have been much nicer. 6. The movie is not good enough to watch."

" Underrated movie. Watch without hesitation.
",2017-06-21 00:00:00,10,"I don't really understand why this movie is so underrated. This is one of the best movies you could watch with parallel universe. Although, you can almost guess its ending if you have seen enough such movies. But still it keeps you engaged all the time. Worth watching."
" An Amazing Directorial Debut
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,8,"Such a terrific experience. Went in not knowing a single thing about it, except for the part it was kind of a romantic dramedy and was really surprised. ""The One I Love"" wasn't really the kind of film I was expecting and that's what probably made me like it so much. Carried by the two leads (the both excellent Mark Duplass and Elisabeth Moss) this is one of those few films where you don't get sick of watching always the same actors on-screen. In fact, the constrained setting makes it much fresh. The soundtrack also factored heavily to create a somewhat creepy and weird atmosphere that the story really benefits from. ""The One I Love"" can be creepy and extremely charming almost at the some time, and you'll find yourself wondering why some things are happening. Despite leaving some questions unanswered, the film still holds up pretty well and is definitely worthwatching.An amazing directorial debut for Charlie Mcdowell."
