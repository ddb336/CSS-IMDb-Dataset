" A powerful, harrowing and emotionally challenging story
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,8,"An extremely powerful movie supported by a very believable cast. Both Guy Pearce and Dakota Fanning are eminently credible in this dark story. Not for the faint hearted, this film contains themes of incest, brutality, and religious fanaticism taken to the extreme for personal gain."
" Story is good if you ignore facts
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,7,"MILD SPOILER ALERTIt's a good movie. Can be tough to watch as there are some uncomfortable scenes. A lot of scenes involve violence towards children and animals that I think story could have been achieved without the visceral imagery. It takes a lot to make me look away from a movie but I found myself looking away a few times. There are also some parts that just don't factually add up which left me questioning things. For example, how exactly does someone cause a babies head to be too big? Why did she not try a C section (we have been preforming them for centuries) How does a horse go for days and days (it seems) without stopping? Where did the winter clothes come from if they ran away in the middle of the night? Wouldn't the metal have been too hot still? If you can forgot simple logic and just go with the story there is a macrabe brutalness to it. Guy Pearce is masterful in this movie. Rarely do I walk away from a movie and think if I saw that actor in real life right now, after watching that performance i would punch them, but I felt that with him. He makes you feel unclean for him. There are parts that drag, and Kit Harrington's American accent is slightly off, but overall good movie."
" A horrifying story and 2 hours of my life I'll never get back.
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,1,"The intro reads as; ""A triumphant epic of survival and a tale of powerful womanhood . . ."" It was NOT that. The first and biggest problem I have with the movie was; it doesn't play in chronological order, which is a pet-peeve of mine. The story is broken into (4) parts. This is how the movie plays, part 3-2-1-4 so each segment is out of order.
Otherwise, the story is brutal, gruesome and violent. They touch on child abuse & rape, more than once. They focus on the oppression of women in the sense that, the only thing women are good for, is working in the brothel and servicing men.
The Minister is so hateful, that I cheered when he finally died, however, many other good people died for no apparent reason, and our hero dies in the end. This is NOT a feminist movie, nor does it celebrate the strength and resolve of our main protagonist. It is garbage from beginning to end."
" Well made film with disturbing subject matter
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,8,"Woman is chased by a vengeful preacher with time jumps and anachronistic storytelling. This Western-thriller is disturbing in its subject matter (rape including of children/child abuse/suicide) in addition to the regular murder and violence one expects from the genre. The cast in this film acted their hearts out and drawn out lead up to the confrontation is incredibly tense. Guy Pearce's character is a monster of the human kind and just gets worse with every revelation. The reveal of the narrator at the end ties the film together. The film itself is well shot and and the locations well-chosen. Time jumps can get a bit confusing and tend to break the pace, but do give the revelations time to breathe. If you can stand the premise, you certainly won't be bored."
" Incredible take on western. Great film.
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,9,"What a movie...none stop suspense. Puts the man in the woman shoes 100-150 years ago. I do admit it was hard to watch but this really pushed some boundaries. Also like the lack of music needed in Western. Music takes away from some movies and it would have certaintly in this.The symbolism and the what ifs of this story are great. The biggest what if is if Jon Snow killed her Dad and spent a rich life together happily...instead the dad killed Jon Snow and stole his money ..in which he used to find his daughter 10 years later.I found this a great movie. Kept me interested the full-screentime. Also enjoy how Dakota Fanning would look into the woods (which you never knew she was looking at her dead mom ""Mom is always watching"")...just how her daughter looks into forest at end. Little thing this movie did was very well done."
" What Crap
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,1,Obviously the Director got to lay out all his fantasies of perversion but didn't know when to quit. If you watch this don't expect any kind of finish that would satisfy anyone. Waste of time. You've been warned.
" Hate women much?
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,1,"I have never been this disgusted by a film in my whole life. I am offended that there are people out there giving this movie a 10 out of 10. They must be as disturbed as whoever wrote this script, or made this movie. Problem is you keep waiting for the so-called retribution, which in itself is the biggest ant-climax of the film. If you're into some masochistic torture of women and children, then this is your kind of film! WARNING to all females inparticular: do NOT watch this film!"
" Master class dark and disturbing modern western
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,10,"Brimstone is an incredible film, but this is not for everyone. This is a very bleak and unflinching vision of the west that is taken from the point of view of an abused woman and her struggle to survive. Dakota Fanning is excellent in this role as is the rest of the cast. This shows the dark side of Christianity and how it was like to be a woman in the times of the rough and unforgiving American frontier. The film pulls no punches in depicting violence and is deeply disturbing and dark movie. But this is also extremely well written, directed and acted. The film is very powerful stuff and Guy Pierce gives his all for a completely sadistic performance as a deeply disturbed and evil preacher. Guy Pierce is one of the finest actors there is and is completely immersed and absolutely believable in whatever role he plays. Brimstone is a completely appropriate title for this film and as such is a vision of Hell on Earth. This is not a popcorn movie, if you want to feel good, you are better suited to watch Driving Miss Daisy. But having said that, this film is exceptional but does not go down so easily like a chocolate milk shake, more like 100 proof liquor."
" Sadism is not entertainment
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,2,"This film is beautiful to ""look at"" but what you're watching is a confusing story filled with scenes of torture and violence perpetrated on women men and children. I can't see any value in this film in any way and I only watched it all the way through to see if it ever had a point. I appreciate the fine acting, I'm a fan of Guy Pierce and Dakota Fanning but I found this film abhorrent to watch."
" Horrible in every way
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,1,If you want to watch a snuff movie about torturing women....nearly every b movie from holland is better to watch.
" Horror in the West
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,9,"This is a great but very violent filming about among other things misogyny.It's really a Horror film set in the Old West.Has a go at religion which i like,and has great acting by all,and my favourite actor Guy Pearce in evil but fine form."
" good film
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,8,Well wotth a watch eventhough it jumps about a bit. Gruesome in parts and unbelievaable in others . Wow pearce is so good in this but its all dakota in this one. she is so so good. dont miss this one.
" If you want to get good sleep don't watch this
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,1,"Go watch something more joyfull, this movie will make you sick"
" Good, bad, ugly...
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,1,"Starting great, going well, ridiculous at the end.You know the picture where they start drawing a horse really nice, but finishing totally messed up? Well, thats much like this movie...
All was pretty good the first three quarters, but then some damn circus has begun."
" One of the worst movies ever
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,1,I watch around 5 a day for my job but this one was so bad it makes all Adam danglers movies a MASTERPIECE
" AS EXPECTED, HOLLYWOOD ALWAYS PERVERTS CHRISTIANITY
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,1,"Showing Christians in only a perverse, evil context.
Misquoting scriptures.
Using scripture out of context.
Anyone watching this movie who truly knows the Bible will easily recognize these misrepresentations and lies. However, not many people are that familiar with the Bible and thus, they will actually believe that the Bible teaches those things which this film blatantly misrepresents.
This story could have been told using Muslim characters instead and the story could have remained the same. In fact, one could easily argue that using Islam would have been a much better vehicle for this story due to the Muslim's Sharia law. Christianity has nothing like Sharia law...so then, why do you suppose Hollywood did not tell this story using Islam instead? Everyone knows the answer to that question.
Christians are the only group in America that society has deemed can be maligned...the only group which it is acceptable to be bigoted against...and Hollywood leads the charge through films such as this."
" Cruel and well made
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,8,How often does it happen you are by chance watching a movie while your attention is on your cellphone and then suddenly you put away the phone cause the movie just takes over.A very cruel westernmovie with great acting performance from the whole cast. I think the Dutch director did an excellent job on cutting the story into a non-chronologically film and am very curious in what more films he will create.
" pease of art
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,10,I NEED THERAPY AFTER WATCHING THIS...outstanding performance
" Too dark! There should be a warning...
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,1,"I had high hopes for the first 30 minutes then, it's a slow dark decent into never-ending gore depravity and hopelessness. Please, if you have any decency at all in your life... DON'T WATCH THIS! Seriously, don't."
" A journey
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,10,"I was apprehensive about watching this after reading the warnings about how dark it is and they were not wrong in a lot of ways but I'm very glad I watched it anyway. It's dark, moving and a truly memorable film. Great performances and one of the best films with real impact I have seen in a long time."
" Totally awesome
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,10,A great story told well. The Dutch people who put this together did an amazing job. Well done.
" BEAUTIFULLY DARK
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,10,"Great story, great actors, great portrayal of disturbing issues that are still evident even up to this generation. Really great!"
" What can you take from this
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,4,"Brimstone is made of 4 chapters (yes with title screens and all) where all 8 people with actual character development die. I'll tag them along the way to make it easier:CHAPTER 1: girl hides a wounded cowboy and his partner in the family barn.
her mother hangs herself (1). the cowboy kills his partner. her dad kills the cowboy (2). then has sex with the girl (yes his daughter).CHAPTER 2: girl runs to a whorehouse. dad runs after her.
she makes a friend, that kills a guy then gets hanged (3). she makes another friend, but this one kills the whorehouse owner (4). then gets killed by the dad (5).CHAPTER 3: girl runs to a farm and gets married. dad runs after her.
then kills her husband (6).CHAPTER 4: girl runs to her father in law's house. dad runs after her.
then kills her son. and the father in law. but the girl kills dad (7). then kills herself (8).So this movie makes a setting, kills every single meaningful character in it (+ 80% of people surrounding them), and moves on to the next one. It does this 4 times, until there is no next one and you're left with zero connection with anything or anyone. If you like plots with message, stay away.But surrounding all of this you do get to see women getting tortured: Hit with belts, slapped, tongues cut off, gagged with iron masks, choked, full package. Also some dying animals (pigs, horses, sheep, you name it). Oh and dead babies, dead children, whipped children... director really hated kids. If that's your thing, highly recommended."
" Spectacular
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,9,"I guess this is my first review about any movie, this movie is truly matches with my taste. Thriller, crime, suspense and dark in horrific way, includes everything. you cannot get off the screen once you have started very well crafted through chapters very good cast. Kudos"
" The most sinister western I've ever seen
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,8,Guy pierce is Incredible and this film punches you in the gut when you least expect it. Edge of my seat Start to finish
" Why Not Just Burn the Money?
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,1,"A total waste of two plus hours. Gratuitously, sadistically violent with no consequences for the evil. Only the production values and acting are good. I've seen better plots in thousand-year-old cemeteries. The ploy of presenting the story out of order annoyed rather than piqued interest. I could go on and on, but ""If you can't say anything nice..."""
" A nasty piece of work
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,2,"It's far too long at near 150 minutes considering the lack of a strong enough plot, and it is generally unsavoury as a watch. I think the director is taking too much pleasure in the covering of the relentless & highly unpleasant subject matter. The characters aren't interesting enough and are not developed sufficiently. The main villain is one-dimensional, and though well-shot it never really goes anywhere that will engage you, leaving you as the movie progresses to 'endure' it rather than enjoy it. For a vastly superior film in all respects with similar themes, try The Salvation which came out one or two years earlier."
" One of the best films of the decade 11/10
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,10,"This film is easily one of the best western films ever, it is a very dramatic and violent film which makes it a bit difficult to see for sensitive people. The film has beautiful cinematography, great performances and this film has one of the best soundtracks from movies I've heard.
In general it is a film that I advise you to watch."
" Wonderful acting, keeps you on the edge of your seat.
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,7,"Brimstone is a heart rending, edge of the seat movie.
That being said it is 30 minutes too long, and it really leaves you with a feeling of, oh come on now, it's enough already.""
It just doesn't stop with the,""Satan never dies"" gambit.
It would have been great with at least one less ""risen from the grave"" scene."
" Solid solid solid movie
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,7,"This movie is so awesome that it's almost tedious to break down what specific parts about it are awesome. Because it is ALL awesome.Pros:
Awesome acting, all around
Awesome cinematography, at all times, every time
Awesome music
Awesome story
Awesomely disturbing elements, I truly believed in the intensity of every situation, the movie forced me to feel it. This movie is not something friendly and gentle. Horrible acts of violence and control are depicted, and set a powerful and necessary tone.Cons:
There's a few of the ""typical"" goofy movie scenes, ie. someone gets shot and they are PROPELLED out a window. No, they didn't fall. They were LAUNCHED! Yea, that's stupid. There's a couple more, but they would be spoiler-ish.This is easily the best western-era movie I've seen. I would have given it a 7.5."
" Point of opening
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,6,"I have read a lot of the critics, so I wanted to add something new:1.the opening scene. It shows the death of an unborn child because (well?) it's head were to big. Joana helps to kill the Baby to save the Life of the mother, but she said to her husband it was the new reverend. If you watch now the movie in its right order you will find out that this opening scene makes no sense whatsoever. Why not warn somebody or telling he is here for here?2. The tongue scene: Well it was completely necessary to cut of the tongue, since otherwise everybody would be suspicious - sarcasm off.3. A brothel with only one guy keeping all girls and nobody tries to go away.4. A GPS for flawed daughters (very nice). - sarcasm really off.One can enjoy this movie for sure and I can tell that it's somehow interesting, but if you construct in your mind the story in its right order you will find nothing but a lack of inconsistencies and stupid character/invincible villains western movie."
" Piece Of Art
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,10,Worth every minute of watching . The way the chapters were organized keeps you thrilled .
" Disturbing movie - not for weak hearted
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,8,"This was a disturbing movie. It was gruesome and takes you to a real gloomy journey of a woman who tries to live a life but is not allowed to. It shows how misogynistic times have been. Dakota Fanning, Emily Jones and above all Guy Pearce has done some brilliant acting. This director is someone to watch out for and this was his first movie I watched but won't forget it for a long long time."
" HOLY CRAP!!! Dark as midnight!!
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,7,"There is dark,, but this is insanely dark and twisted,,, but at the same time an incredible movie.If Dakota Fanning didn't get nominated for some awards for her performance in this,,, she should've. WoW!! She and the girl who played a younger version of her character were SOOOOO good!!!Like we didn't already know Guy Pearce is one of the top actors working today, he goes and does this. His character is unbelievably insane!! Ugh,, it hurts to see how good he played this part,,, he showed true commitment to his craft here.Like I said before, this one is DARK!!! The acting is INCREDIBLE,, but if you are faint of heart, and cannot compartmentalize,,,,
DON'T WATCH THIS ONE!!"
" Do not waste your time - sick movie for sick people
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,1,"A movie for sick people made by sick people. The movie should be made illegal. An underage girl of 8-9 years old is beaten up and whipped by her grandfather and is about to be raped by him while her own daughter is about to watch a rape of the granddaughter by her grandfather. The mother was previously raped by her father while she was a minor. The father is a priest and they try to bring religion, church and God into all this mess. I fast-forwarded this 2.5-hour movie out of stubbornness to see whether it makes any sense at the end. No, it makes even sicker at the end and makes me puke. How in the world, this movie has 7.1 IMDb rating? Most likely rated by the same sick people with the high rating. Recall this movie! At least the world has normal people rating it with the lowest score."
" enjoy
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,9,"The thrill of enjoying this movie I can't talk about, wow wow wow"
" Anti religious western
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,7,"It's a slow movy and as I hate deep religious people justifying their acts and male domination with the Bible I felt a deep discuss for the priest. And I think when you have this hate in your stomach , it is a good movie with some shocking scenes."
" Dark
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,10,This is dark violent and at times upsetting. But worth a watch to see Dakota fanning humped doggy style
" Horrible
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,1,"If your idea of an entertaining movie is to spend 2 & 1/2 hours watching a sadistic madman torture and abuse women and children, over and over, with no form of payback at the end, then by all means, watch it."
" Well-made but misguided & irresponsible
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,5,"Yes, let all us not-so-smart actors and directors iirresponsibly indulge ourselves squeezing as much sick, hypocritical ugliness as we can into 2 hours, successfully leading naive people to believe it was all because of religion. But no matter how well-made the effort, it wasnt. It was the same human evil that is in many people, that gets rationalized with or without religion. The reality is evil runs more unchecked today without religion. So, the whole premise of this movie, which actually amounts to bankrolled propaganda for an even more dishonest modernity, is false, fundamentally misguided and misleading."
" Prepare yourself first, especially weak hearts ....
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,10,"Drink up maybe. There's considerable gore in the movie but it's not so much about it as it is about the number of cruel, brutal, painful and unbearable life changing events that just one person can face in their lives that it may make us think if is it all even possible. But the way this movies been made, it all seems logical and possible. Sometimes you just need love from one person for all of life and Sometimes the hate from just one person will destroy your spirit to live. Whatte movie ..."
" A Solid Presentation.
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,7,"What is it with Guy Pierce and ultra-violent films? In some ways, ""Brimstone"" resembles his Australian western ""The Proposition."" Both are known for their brutal and sadistic violence. At least here, in ""Brimstone"", the women weren't forced into the story - they were integral to it. In ""The Proposition"", the sergeant's wife, Emily Watson, was simply out of place and completely unnecessary other than to have a little eye candy for the men and a person a female moviegoer can relate to (if that was the film's intent). Guy Pierce's acting was better here; he was truly believable as a twisted man of the cloth who, like thousands of preachers worldwide, ""bend"" the scriptures to their own warped way of thinking. Too bad that millions of suckers (so-called believers) tolerate their BS because they're as stupid as dirt. Recommended."
" Horrible, despicable actions towards children
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,1,"No one wants to see children physically abused let alone sexual abused! Despicable, horrible waste of time!!Right when u think it could get worse, let's beat a child.Let's not mention how confusing it was....The writer needs serious mental help & so does anyone which thinks this movie should receive stars, wish there was a no star option."
" Darker than a black hole but loved it
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,8,"A movie that had me by the throat for the whole durance. It is a movie without hope. If you want your movies to be feel goods and with a happy ending then this is not the movie for you. Life in those days in that sort of environment was sometimes unforgiven. This movies is unforgiven. Now they have professional help for people with a very disturbed mind but in those days a Jack the Ripper kind of person could get away with basically everything. Maybe the minister was a bit over the top but wasn,t Jack the Ripper? And maybe there was no remorse in his character but is that perse a thing when a person is as sick in his mind as that. And also maybe he can shoot better in the mist than a sniper on a clear day and moves better around than a navy seal but that is movies for ya.
Nobody would ever believe a female victim and under the shield of extreme religieus believes the woman is placed under the man. So female victim, endure it, or else you must be under the wings of the devil and be punished. Many of these settlers (Dutch and German origine) were extreme in there religious believes and that is why they left Europe, because nobody wanted them. The law in those days was basically wildwest. All these elements were brought together and it has made this movie a mix of total darkness and hopelessness. Loved it."
" A bit too much
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,7,"A bit too much at some points which made me decide not to give it an 8. My wife decided to watch something else because some scenes were too rough.
The scenes where they talked Dutch though were a nice surprise. And it was Dutch without an accent (no surprise of Carice of course). Guy Pearce surprisingly good spoke English with a Dutch accent."
" Would be an 8 star for actor performance if ..
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,3,"Great actors good overal movie, but a 3 star for the storyline. There is such a thing as going too dark for a movie to be enjoying at all. It just make me feil bit sick"
" Watching this movie is pure torture
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,1,"Even the chieldren was no excluded...
There are no mistery and no thriller."
" Man haters will LOVE this
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,3,"Several characters exist and have no bearing on the plot. The plot? I suppose some people are born to live a tragic life and are cursed? So if you're limited with what you are able to do, stay true to your instincts because you're going to die anyway? Fact is only man haters can relate to the tone of this movie, because it is more about a religious fanatic psychopath that is a talking/raping Michael Myers."
" An epic sized film about how disposable women were probably universally treated in general.
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,7,"Brilliantly acted, directed, very well scored. Also, the cinematography was gorgeous.At first, I was going to give this film a 3/10 because it didn't seem to have any redeeming value. But it's really just about one small (ish) women who in a way represented all women of that time - seemingly powerless.
Fanning does an amazing job of gathering strength throughout the film until it seems like she will win in the end. That is until her past catches her, accepts her fate but also knowing in her heart her daughter may have it better. The director does a phenomenal job of portraying this doomed character arc.However, thought the Kip Harrington ending should've been done differently. And the sign language thing wasn't completely believable. Also, could've done without so much disgusting violence. Some wasn't completely believable.But overall, a very interesting film. Pearce and Fanning were worth the price of admission alone or by themselves. Without their performances, the film really wouldn't have worked at all. But also, great performances by the rest of the cast.The Reverend is a about a twisted interpretation of the bible brought to life, a despicable psyche, and how both have probably fed off each other his entire life to justify his actions at any given moment."
" Brutal & Sickening
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,1,Why would anyone write and make a movie of this nature?
" There aren't many movies I wish I could unsee ...
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,2,"But this is as sick and twisted as it gets. I find nothing redeeming in this story whatsoever? It just ,made me ill. If that was the directors purpose, he succeeded.
The cinematography is decent. If I had seen this in a cinema with my wife? I would have left the theater well before it was over and asked for my money back. I cannot begin to fathom why someone would waste the time writing such a horrific and tragic movie."
" Incredibly depressing
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,2,"Imagine a Hallmark movie on estrogen. Does the bad guy supposed to be so over the top? Guy Pearce plays some religious villain that would be laughable if he wasn't so demonstrable evil. After an hour into this movie I ask my wife who I was watching this with ""Why?""It's like a snuff film for women who hate men and themselves."
" Pretty bad
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,1,"The acting overall is good. The tiresome and sadistic ""christian"" man ultimately is boring. Adding a pseudo spiritual element to what is ultimately a pretty cheap horror movie is neither insightful nor edgy. Don't waste your time with this lazy story.It is a shame Pearce decided this was worth his time."
" Waste of Time
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,1,"Most useless 2 hours I've spent in a long time. If you like to watch pointless, gratuitous brutality and violence coupled with bad acting (Guy Pearce, particularly) this is the movie for you. I enjoy slow paced movies that take a long time to develop and I don't mind gritty..... but this is awful. Just skip it."
" Have you therapist on speed dial
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,5,"This movie was dark. Like make you feel unbelievably upset, I felt as though I should talk to a therapist after. Not kidding, it's bleak. But I am giving it 5 simply for the fact that Dakota fanning is astounding in this movie. I am happy it's over, and that I never have to watch it again, but I do think everyone should attempt to watch it once."
" Ugh
",2019-11-28 00:00:00,2,This has some of the most unpleasant never before seen acts of violence to oneself and a few times others but the way it goes backwards ruins it from the start. If it went in normal order and the evil Dad was supernatural in nature like a minion of Satan and had some unique way to only be killed then we would have a film. OMG so god damn boring.
" Dakota Fanning Made This Film Watchable
",2019-11-19 00:00:00,6,An easy 45 minutes could have been cut from this dark 2 1/2 hour movie. The director was so impressed with himself he just couldn't part with any of the scenes - many of which added nothing - not even texture. Going overboard with male brutality required going overboard with feminist resistance. Dakota Fanning did more for this film than anyone with her acting and an incredible range of facial expression. Guy Pierce great job at playing evil. I'd like to see him in better roles - loved him in Time Machine. It's a shame the two best actors were completely ignored by the Dutch who nominated themselves for nearly all awards.
" DISGUSTING
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,1,Had to turn it off after constant grisly and obscene sequences. HOW can ANY of these awesome actors be okay with showing other Humans this filth??? Don't waste your time. They do not have your heart in mind.
" Brilliant, realistic, and more layered than I expected.
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,10,"Amazing performances by everyone; brutally honest. Someone (Eleanor Roosevelt?) said you could say truths in fiction you can't in real life. Koolhoven has done that. I don't want to repeat other user reviews, but I have a few comments I didn't read in other reviews (admittedly I didn't read all 200+):Sexual abuse is not just the story's challenge, it's a metaphor for a toxic patriarchy.The end highlights the pervasiveness of the patriarchy.It's less about faith being a problem than about the misuse of religion for power. The description of hell is apt. How can love exist in the Reverend when his primary desire is for power, and his view of his women is that of property? He also promotes things treated as abhorrent in the bible as though they were recommended. His opening lines show what kind of person he is.This is also a movie about hypocrisy vs. honesty: Joanna/Liz and her mother are fighting to be honestly themselves, not to let others force false narratives onto them.The shots were not only often gorgeous by themselves, but beautiful in relation to each other. E.g., the visual of the girl fleeing her raping father echoing the horse running across the same field was wonderful.Thank you, Koolhoven, for showing Kit Harrington's funny side, hidden all too thoroughly by Game of Thrones. It was a very brief moment, but without a smile, the realism would have been undermined; reality has humor and beauty as well as horror. That awareness is what makes this a great movie."

" Is Anything More Menacing Looking
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,9,"Than Guy Pearce with dark eyes!?. Stuff of frickin nightmares! Wow, the whole cast is incredible in this nightmare horror western... but it's Guy Pearce's movie... everybody else is only along for the ride. Some repugnant subject matter but that's definately part of the horror. The acting is so top notch... it's almost beautiful."
" Horrifyingly & Compelling
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,9,"Wow... this movie is so amazing and horrifying all at the same time. What a grim story... but told so well. If u can get past the insidious incest pedophilic undercurrent... it's really a good horror story. The acting is superb. Guy Pierce is such a remarkable and beautiful actor, it's a bit hard to see him so menacing and cruel. See this movie with no preconceived notions and more as a horror thriller and you'll appreciate it much more."
" Unbelievable!
",2019-10-29 00:00:00,10,"The ONLY bad thing about this movie are the reviews and ratings from the dumbest, most antagonizing people ever! You are pathetic!
And even though I know my offensive talking will not shake the earth I hope that some people will understand the emotions that went into writing this comment for one of the most stunning movies ever. This movie tops the vibe I got from Casualties of War, the in my opinion best anti-war movie ever. If the movie really is realistic I am not sure, but you shouldn't forget one of it's genres is mystery."
" Brimstone for the viewer
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,5,This film is just as vile in its plot as dumb in behavior of its characters.
" A fine piece of filmmaking that's appreciated not enjoyed
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,8,"BrimstoneThis is a depressing movie that is often unsettling and hard to watch.
That said It's still boasts some fine filmmaking.
Martin Koolhoven has crafted a movie that has a unique style of storytelling.
Played out in reverse order for the most part Koolhoven's style is truly engaging.
His film tells the tale of Liz a young woman trying to build a new life after escaping the evil clutches of her abusive and rather psychotic father.
Guy Pearce is terrifying as Liz's father and gives a chilling performance as the Reverend.
He constantly pursues Liz eventually catching up with her as she tries to live a peaceful life.
Pearce is almost demonic in appearance with black eyes and scarred features.
When ever he is onscreen he commands attention.
Dakota Fanning plays the adult version of Liz but it is Emilia Jones as the younger version of the character that almost steals the show. Only Pearce's performance is more captivating.
There's strong support from Game Of Thrones veterans Kit Harington and Carice van Houten.
Their screen time is limited but their contribution adds much to the story.
Brimstone is violent and doesn't shy away from scenes showing morally wrong acts. At times it can be hard to watch and I wonder if the actors, Guy Pearce in particular were unnerved by their performances.Brimstone is a good looking movie with excellent cinematography, fine editing and a fantastic musical score by Junkie XL.
This film has excellent visual quality and audio is cinematic making for a enthralling experience
I truly appreciated this film.
It's very good but to say I enjoyed the events transpiring onscreen would not be the correct choice of words.
It's a fine addition to the genre and well worth your time."
" Horribly amazing
",2019-09-19 00:00:00,10,"How can a movie be this brutal yet I could not stop watching? Beautiful cinematography, interesting story and intense acting. Watch it when you're in the right state of mind since it's so heavy."
" Dark, compelling and realistic
",2019-09-10 00:00:00,8,"Just saw this movie and although not perfect is definitely packs a punch. It is beautifully made and it captured my attention till the end. I think the end of the.reverend is underwhelming and the ending perhaps unnecessary but the acting of everyone is good or great. Very impressed by young Joanna and Dakota Fanning. It doesn't deserve the bad reviews. Viewers wonder why the violence is necessary? As if real life isn't that violent? People and animals get brutally killed every day, women get raped and killed every day, priest abuse children, fathers abuse daughters, good men get killed. It is what happened and it is still happening now. Religion often only makes things worse as it often gives evil a reason to be evil. Religion isn't evil in itself, but it gets used so often to do evil. If you can't watch this it means you don't understand what humans are capable of. This is a warning against evil, religion used for evil and violence against the weak. Impressive movie, go and see it if you dare."
" Horrible in every way...

" Ouch
",2019-08-15 00:00:00,7,"Not an easy film to watch, but well worth the effort if you can stomach all the hardships our infinitely sympathetic lead has to endure.One catastrophe after another befalls poor Dakota Fanning, mainly thanks to ONE OF THE WORST HUMAN BEINGS EVER TO WALK THE FACE OF THE PLANET (Guy Pierce doing a top notch job) and the inherit sexism of the 19th century.Yep, this is the kind of downright despicable depravity you won't see on those Sunday afternoon Westerns your grandpappy falls asleep to. If you like the typically sanitised Cowboys vs Indians in a romanticised setting, this ain't for you.On the other hand, if you fancy being dragged through seven shades of hell before emerging to blink on the other side feeling every emotion possible... then saddle up, pardner. Have I got the movie for you."
" Combination of two genres: Horror and Western
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,7,"The acting and direction are exemplary, yet this movie is so horrific that parts are difficult to sit through.It would have been better if it was in chronological order, instead of part 3 shown first, then part two, then part one, and then part four.The movie features a great performance by Dakota Fanning as Liz. Kit Harington gives a credible American accent as Samuel. I have never seen a more evil character in movie history than ""The Reverend"", played very well by Guy Pearce.Be forewarned: this movie is not for children or for the faint-hearted."
" Almost
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,6,I give it 6 stars for trying to do something original with the genre. Without elaborating on the plot (which you can read elsewhere) the film was beautifully shot and the first half (the whole film is actually too long) was really working. The main characters believable and the sense of dread all pervading. But the second half just undoes all the good work. Guy Pierce's evil minister just comes off as comical in the end. I had no issue with the more extreme moments in the film - and they ARE extreme - but they end up reaching levels of absurdity. It's a waste of what could have been a truly gripping film.
" Brutal but GREAT!
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,10,"Great movie!!!! It always has you on your toes. It's not like your normal western movie but that's the best part about it. If your too sensitive and get bothered too easily by gory, sinister or sinful actions in fiction movies than this movie is not for you to watch. Great acting throughout the whole movie, Dakota is an amazing actor, very interesting storyline. I highly recommended to all who can handle watching gruesome events in movies."
" Superb
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,10,"Wow, what a film. Ok it is very dark and harrowing, but the plot is excellent. Dakota Fanning is simply superb, and Guy Pearce plays his role fantastically well, he gave me the creeps. If your not a fan of the western genre, do not let it put you off seeing it, if you can stomach some harrowing scenes, you will love it, I rate it in my top ten best films"
" Vile disgusting movie
",2019-03-28 00:00:00,1,This movie switches back and forth in time and you really can't make much out of it. It is one vile and disgusting movie. Do not waste your time watching it.
" Very dark but WOW, the story is amazing.
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,10,"Ignore the bad reviews. This is actually a very very good movie with superb cast, acting and a really great story. Easily worth the watch. 10/10"
" Meaningless gore
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,2,"Too much gore leading to nothing. Pretentious movie with hardly any content. Some good scenery but that's all there is to it. Too long, too slow ... not entertaining at all. One of the worst movies of the year."
" Hell awaits you.
",2019-03-11 00:00:00,1,"Brimstone is just a horrible viewing experience. Why the film was made and why anyone would like it, disgusts me.Only a sick twisted individual could make such a film. The acting's fine however. Kit Harington's character dies stupidly, I don't understand why he'd be in a minor role. I like Dakota Fanning as well, but I would assume at least a quarter of the people who watched the film, watched it because of him. The church goers just sitting there like everything's okay, with his wife's face locked up.... I'm done."
" Exceptional Movie - As Well Done As All Movies Should Be ... But Are ""NOT""
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,10,"02/20/2019 Dakota Fanning and Guy Pearce are flawless as actors in this film. The storyline, the subject matter, cold and harsh, unforgiving. Early in the movie the timeline changes to an earlier period for the foundation to build. The zigs and zags of that storyline only further enhance the overall, never knowing where it's going or how it will end? My complaint? A 2 1/2 hour long movie that should have been an hour shorter. Excellent movie either way. Bon Appetit"
" Great Cinema!

" Not Bad, But Not Great
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,4,"Really a brutal dark movie.Chapter 1;
A mute young woman who apparently has a miserable past with the new reverend coming to town.
Her husband being killed by the reverend - stung in the stomach and strangled with his own guts.
The man's boy who has to shoot his father to stop the pain.
Their house is being burned down.Chapter 2;
A young woman, Joanna, who walks confused around in the desert is picked up by some Chinese and sold for prostitution at the Inferno.
We find out later that it is the mute woman from chapter 1 and find out how she went from being Joanna to Elizabeth... a long, tough trip from a young girl in a whorehouse to pretending to be someone else she can escape.Chapter 3;
Finally, we get to see Kit Harington. He has been shot and have killed some men, but we don't know why, to start with. In chapter 3 we go back in time - Joanna is Joanna and the reverend has not yet got his scar from his visit to Inferno (from chapter 2).
We get to see how evil the reverend is - punish his wife hard because she dosen't want to sleep with him and she speaks her native language, Dutch.It is just so sad to see all that she has been through, just to get arrested for a murder her friend commitet and the kill herself :(There is nothing hidden in this movie. We see everything from rape, western duels to burning people, man get eaten by hogs and bullet holes through the skull.
It's an excellent movie, but a little strange how they've put it together... a lot of jumping back and forth - sometimes a little confusing.Guy Pearce is so good in this movie, as a cruel reverend who uses God as an excuse to do bad things and treat woman like garbage."
" Maybe a weak heroine isn´t that good for a feminist message.
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,4,"Cons:
Villain is all knowing and omnipotent (he can apparently teleport).
Heroine has a weak character and is always preying on others to solve her problems.
The writers clearly don´t understand how weapons work and did not bother researching it.
Characters tell the audience their feelings instead of portraying them.
Seriourly lousy camera work.Pros:
Good Costume design and child actors."
" Warning, there may be spoilers
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a must watch. It keeps you on your toes the whole time, and because the story is backward it just make you understand the behavior of the characters more as you keep watching.

" How Might Be the Heart of Someone that Writes Such a Story?
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,7,"""Brimstone"" is one film that arises emotion and stays in the viewer. The long and realistic story is one of the gloomiest, most depressing, cruel and unfair without redemption ever written. However, let me make clear that the film is excellent and the viewer shall not give up watching in the beginning. The screenplay divided in four parts - Revelation, Exodus, Genesis and Retribution - is perfect, disclosing the non-chronological saga of the protagonist Liz / Joanna. The cast is magnificent, with Guy Pearce representing the personification of evil and Dakota Fanning difficult to be recognized in the role of a ""cursed"" woman, supported by Carice van Houten and Kit Harington. The locations, costumes and cinematography are top notch and the haunting music score is also magnificent. The only question that remains is how might be the heart of someone that writes such a story? My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Amaldiçoada"" (""Cursed"")"
" Very dark movie
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,8,"Outstanding performance of all actors.

" If your IQ is low, you will not like the film
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,10,"This was a total surprise for me. I started watching because Fanning, Pearce, and Kit.....with no expectations. I almost abandoned the film when I saw the ""mute"" concept but made it through to Act 2.I loved how they laid out the film in 4 acts and revealing the story slowly by working backwards. This, of course, is nothing new. What I loved most about the film was the brutal nature of the old west. How your family tree could be wiped out instantly. This is not 2018 and the BS fluff we expect in our films and fluff in our lives arguing over LGBT or race.....this was a cold country and the toughest survived.For everyone bashing on the film, they are fans of all the network TV junk...life is fair and there is always a handsome doctor dating a handsome firefighter.If you like serious and dark films, this is a great film. If you are a weak wuss, then don't waste your time. You won't really get the deeper meaning of country survival."
" DARK SUBJECTS NOT ENTERTAINING
",2018-12-10 00:00:00,1,"The subject matter is very dark, including incest and child sexual assault. Whilst those matters should be exposed and eliminated. As to whether they should be portrayed in such a horrific manner in a film would be the subject of debate. Despite the fact that this movie maybe we'll acted. This has gone beyond drama, and regardless of what possible good intentions of the creators were it is not entertainment. Unless for whatever reasons you enjoy movies that are so dark they are extremely depressing and upsetting I would give this movie a wide berth."
" Brutal and dark - but really, really good
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,8,"A more realistic presentation on some fates during the western period. Great acting, suspense untill last moment and, to the more fainter hearts, a harsh reality check on the voilence existing in those times."
" Good movie if you're dumb and believe everyone is a total moron in real life
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,1,The movie had a good way of getting you on the edge of your seat and told an interesting story although the path it took was just stupid.The ending was ridiculous and made no sense without spoiling it she would of been recognised by everyone there and didn't have to do what she did. The main story basically treats the audience as dumb and given the chance I wouldn't have bothered to watch it.
" Splendid
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,8,"Not only is the directing and cinematography done immaculately, it supports the plot and character growth brilliantly. Dacota's performance is exquisite, real and confusing... her eyes tell a story not yet told but becomes relevant during the film, she is simply brilliant! Guy's character portrayal leaves you despising the villain. He does it so well that you dislike his entire being; character or not. I was mesmerized by the performance of both these prolific actors. Young Joanna had me in tears of empathy, she is striking and exceptionally talented. The supporting cast suited each part brilliantly - compliments to the casting directors.The film itself was very well done. A must see!"
" Just wow. But how did I miss this movie?
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,9,"This movie in my opinion is a brutal masterpiece. It shows many harsh and upsetting situations during that time and era. But the real question is, was it too harsh and real to be accepted by the general audience?"

" Politically motivated, shallow and ridiculous!
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,1,"Despite obvious care in the making, the narrative is absurd, utterly boring and frankly enraging by its portrayal of men. Every woman is a poor victim and every man is an animal. It's one more movie spoiled by politically correct ideology. This one is much more disguised propaganda than movie making."
" Brimstone smells of dutch gin
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,5,"Brimstone is a brave attempt to make a western, but it lacks the character of the West. It's a European film and not very American. Yes, it's situated in West America but both the storyline and the chacters are dutch. It is too pretentious and lacks reality. No John Ford realism or the simplicity of Clint Eastwood. Nice try, but keep making European movies mr Koolhoven."
" Western Memento
",2018-10-05 00:00:00,8,"A western in 3 acts. And all give new if not completely different perspectives on the story and on the characters. It's really well made and has a few surprises. So it does warrant multiple viewings. Just to see where what happens and what it means for the story and the characters involved.It's mean and it's gritty, just like some of the best western dramas you may hold very dear to your heart. So if this is your cup of tea, you may feel like some of the reviewers here and call this the movie of the year (whichever year it was you watched it). And while slow, it still packs quite a lot of punches (violence wise, sometimes of the mind, sometimes literally)."
" Seriously messed up
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,1,"What a horrible fd up movie. I wish I did not watch it . Makes me sick such a movie .

" Smart writing and directing but ITS just kinda boring...
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,5,"I just wanna say i like how the movie presented 
The way how they showed it in chapters and how it describes the old western horror when religion was so crazy To this point...but thats the movie message was to give you this side of the thoes old days if you think that you gona enjoy the scenes or western fights ect then NO this movie is kinda a documentary but in a dark way to give you a glimpse to how things were and personaly I prefer movies like this when it only give it to you in interesting way...THIS movie only shows the violent side nothing enjoyable really and thats the main point when you watch a movie about history IT needs to be interesting...
At the end thats my review and you have your own but I think this movie deserves 5/10"

" Waste of my time
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,1,"This movie jumps all over the place the whole time. Most of the shots are in it for shock value and just waste 80% of the movies screen time. The acting was plain and wooden, the story was just as bad. I want my time back please. Whoever made this movie should retire."
" Worth watching
",2018-09-21 00:00:00,10,I will never trust Rotten tomatoes ratings again. Quite simply one of the best movies I have ever seen. I nearly didn't watch the movie because of their ratings. The only people that wouldn't understand this movie would be people with a low attention span or young children. The acting was quite brilliant especially Guy Pierce who has come a long way since Neighbors. I will never underrate his acting ability ever again. So versatile from Priscilla to this role. I am an Aussie so I may be a wee bit biased. Just reccomend that people don't always trust the ratings and give a movie a chance. If you are are like me you will know in the first half hour it is worth watching.

" Not a feminist noir western
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,5,"I think this movie will go down ungracefully a couple of years from now.
Its not the actors or the directing its the split between the manuscript and the outcome.
Its the writer behind the director who should feel uneasy about his production.
In the end everything becomes graphical violence.
I dont like that, but i feel respect for the actors so i would never downrate this movie or uprate to make any statement about its artistic value.
Its ok, but not much else and the graphic violence is disturbing cause the plot doesnt really work."
" Great movie

" ""If you don't obey the rules, you're guilty. And if you're guilty, you're gonna pay.""
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,9,"Told in a series of flashback narratives before returning to the present day of the story. ""Brimstone"" is a harrowing look at the life of a woman on the run from her past but irrevocably forced to confront the man who destroyed her successive families. One would be hard pressed to encounter a more despicable villain in cinema than the character of The Reverend (Guy Pearce), who's interpretation of the Bible goes only one way, and that's to his evil advantage. He is so sinister in fact, that he knows his immortal soul is eventually doomed, yet pursues his mission of hate filled revenge against a daughter who had the temerity to stand up for herself. There are times when a non-linear story is a problem, but here I thought it worked quite well without being too confusing. The technique was particularly noteworthy in explaining how the young girl Joanna (portrayed by Emilia Jones) became the woman named Elizabeth Brundy, upon assuming the identity of a murdered prostitute in the town of Bismuth. This following a successful escape from her home before further abuse could be dealt by her preacher father. The revelation that The Reverend is in fact Joanna's father doesn't come totally out of left field if one follows the story closely, but still registers a shock that carries through for the rest of the picture.I probably would have given this movie a ten rating but a number of minor points detracted from a perfect score. There was no explanation for the behavior of Eli's (William Houston) son Matthew (Jack Hollington) in his denial of Liz (Dakota Fanning) as his real mother. If there was resentment against her because she replaced his own mother who died, that wouldn't have been too difficult to explain. Then there was the latrine hanging scene in which Samuel (Kit Harington) killed his partner. The logistics of that scene really didn't work very well, as it seemed to me that the guy being hung had better leverage than he made use of, his feet continuously slipping off the latrine seat which was all he would have needed to save himself. His scattershot firing was also ill placed, had he shot straight up all three times he might have scored a hit to save himself as well. Having never experienced that type of situation, maybe I'm just being too critical.And finally, there was Liz's escape with her hands tied behind her back when The Reverend got the upper hand in the cabin. I don't doubt that there may be a person limber enough to pull off that feat, but I think the odds dictate against. Still, it was a triumphant moment for the aggrieved woman after witnessing the cursed Reverend flay her daughter while stating ""I will beat your mother out of you"". For the moment, it was a temporary victory for a woman who decided at an early age that she would never be one to turn the other cheek. It was not surprising then, that when arrested, Liz's final act of triumph would be to take her own life, rather than succumb to the frontier justice of men who interpreted laws in their own fashion."
" Warning: Anti-Christian diatribe!
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,1,"A viscous polemic against Christianity, contrived to put Christians in the worst possible light. It sets up an outlandish twisting of Scripture as the basis for a diatribe that panders to the paranoia of secularism that all Christians are to be feared as deluded, evil psychopaths who only desire to make others, especially women, miserable and oppressed. No sect ever interpreted 1 Corinthians 7:36 as condoning incest with one's daughter. Even the Old Testament vehemently condemns any such notion. This movie's goal is to provoke paranoia and persecution against anyone who tries to live a Christian life according to the Bible. Dangerous!!!!!"
" Horror Western Subgenre
",2018-08-02 00:00:00,10,"There are a number of ways this film can be understood. A revenge tale, a tale of the insane Old West, a tale of pedophilia, a Slasher film, or maybe a Cautionary Tale about following anyone in organized religion--especially since Jesus never established any such thing and does not require it. Go back and study that if you contend with me, but you'll still be wrong. This is a deeply disturbing film, and sadly will not become a Classic Western like Dances With Wolves or Hostiles--and this is because of the horrid subject matter, being basically that a psychopathic father who is also a fringe Dutch preacher twists Holy Scripture to prove that since his wife won't be intimate with him that he has the right to take his 13-year-old daughter to bed. And he does, of course. Later in the film, he comes within minutes of raping his daughter's 8-year-old girl. Best line in any film, and I paraphrase: ""It's not the flames of Hell that hurt the most, but the absence of Love."" The absence of God. The separation from God. That is Hell. Many of us experience this even before we die. He did. What about you?"
" Western Genre Torture Porn
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,3,"About a third of the way into this I was thinking it a somewhat Cormac McCarthy-esque type of film, only without the good writing. But, still, interesting in a fashion. Then it falls off the rails. Sure, life was brutal for women in the day, but none of the female characters here helped themselves at all, only made the absolute worst decisions at the worst times. Also, most men are horrible jerks or criminals, and the very few good men are dumb as oxen. Finally, why don't film characters ever realize that guns are NOT knives? You don't have to get so close to someone as to touch them--or allow them to take your gun and kill you with it. Oh, that's right: BAD WRITING! Stand back a few feet and just pull the trigger WITHOUT the grandstanding speech. Sheesh! That's where I booked out, end of third act. Too late for me; save yourselves, and take a pass."

" What's the purpose....?

" Life is too short
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,3,"Excellent acting by Dakota Fanning. Hammy, wooden acting by Guy Pearce. An interesting, terrifying idea. A weak script. I regret having given over two hours of my life to this."
" It's not a horror movie.
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,6,"There are some pretty grimy scenes in this movie, but it's not as bad as some of these reviews would have you think. If you get upset easily this might not be the movie for you, but it's no Saw. Definitely not a date night movie. If you want a ""Who's who"" plot with some cool action this is the movie for you. It's not the most impressive, intricate plot ever, but it's told segmented and non-linear, which makes it significantly more interesting. Sometimes it's a Western, sometimes it's a wannabe Quentin Tarantino movie. It switches back and forth. Don't take it too seriously, and don't think too deep about the plot. Cinematography is good, the lighting in some scenes doesn't make sense but it's nothing that would detract from the movie. Guy Pearce kills it in this movie, he acts out a really strange role really well. I start movies at a rating of 5 and go up and down from there. This movie gets big points off the bat for Guy Pearce, who will keep you entertained the entire movie. It loses points for some pacing issues, and I wish the story after you ""figure out"" everything that's going on was a little more cohesive. The movie is clearly understandable, but left me questioning a lot of decisions. Like I said, a fun movie if you don't go too deep into it."
" Anti-Christian Agenda?
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,4,"I always hate it when a movie or television episode portrays a ""religious"" person as being demented (like in Carrie, for example), and misquotes the Bible, saying that it says they can mistreat people. And then when some people see that, it reinforces their belief that Christians are bad and the Bible tells people to do bad things. And this one is one of the worst that I've seen (if not the worst). One of the main reasons I wanted to see the movie was because Dakota Fanning is in it. But I knew that she was raised as a Southern Baptist, so she would have known that the way the script was written went against proper scriptural meaning. But, maybe she was denouncing her Christian upbringing and was more interested in having a leading role. She did a decent job as a troubled mute, but the writing and content overwhelms any good acting and scenery. One positive thing I can say about it is that I liked that it was in parts because it made it easier to watch it in two nights."
" Gripping storyline makes this truly miserable film worthwhile
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,6,"It's impossible for anybody to say that they 'enjoyed' this film, because there's nothing at all to enjoy. It's a dark, bleak and utterly depressing film from the first scene to the last. What makes 'Brimstone' worth watching is its gripping storyline, first rate cinematography and fascinating bunch of character. It has the feel of a high end, expensive production and is difficult to fault in a technical sense.'Brimstone' is brutal and uncompromising in its approach and features no end of violence and torment. This contributes to a tense and depressing atmosphere which remains throughout the film. A lot of people will be put off by this alone, and I wouldn't recommend watching this film if you aren't in the mood for something emotionally deep and powerful. Those who give it a chance though are rewarded with a very well made film with a gripping storyline that, despite the truly miserable tone, is definitely worth your time."
" Not my cup of tea
",2018-06-04 00:00:00,3,"Based off a few reviews I've read, one either loves or hates this movie. I'm definitely on the latter side. I thought the acting of the main cast was great, but the darkness and evil aspects just wore me down, to the point where all I could hope for was some form of just ending.To that note the ending was pretty much a let down. I don't need a Hollywood ending per say, but with such a dark tone throughout I was hoping for something better in the end.So for me it was a tough movie to watch and just kept getting harder and harder to watch, where I debated 2/3 in about turning it off. I hate movies like that. I love drama and suspense, but this was just bad gets worse gets horrible and demented. And then for the ending to be more or less a let down as well, I give this 3/10 only because of some decent acting."
" Good, apart from the flaws
",2018-05-10 00:00:00,6,"BRIMSTONE is a watchable and well-directed western drama from the Netherlands. It has some pretty big flaws that are impossible to ignore, but a kind of surreal, slow-burning plot with biblical touches which get in your head. One thing I didn't like was the non-linear structure; this is told in four chapters but they don't take place chronologically, making it confusing at times. A logical progression, from beginning to end, would have been much better. At two and a half hours the film is also way too long and feeling padded at times, so some judicious cutting would have helped a treat. What this does feature is some fine acting, particularly from the great Guy Pearce who really relishes the chance to play a powerful and imposing villain. I'm less keen on Dakota Fanning, although the actress playing her younger self is very good and could go far. Kit Harrington features prominently on the cover but turns out to have a very small role considering. The film is starkly violent and very explicit at times, a gruelling and realistic experience; with a bit of tinkering it could have been a masterpiece."
" Some will get this, others won't
",2018-05-01 00:00:00,8,"The story is harrowing, thought-provoking and dark.Dakota Fanning played an exceptional part, Guy Pierce definitely brought an evil so gross I felt uncomfortable in my stomach at times.To the reviewers that could not believe he could be where she was/find her, remember she has distinctive features I.e two moles on the back of her neck. A man, hell-bent on finding and torturing his daughter shows how compelled he is to complete his goal. Pushed to the brink of desperation, Liz/Joanna forfeits her old life/self and cuts out her own tongue in the hope she would be somewhat unrecognisable and create a new life.I also find the cutting out the tongue quite symbolic, after witnessing and enduring the many horrors of her upbringing, she possibly vowed never to speak of them? That if she survived to old age, that life would die with her? Physically, nothing stopped the reverend and nothing and nobody got in his way until he put Liz's/Joanna's daughter in danger. But be warned, do not mess with a mother and her child! A mother's bond with her child cannot be easily broken and I think that reflects in the film.Religion played a huge part, although always in the background, the dark side of convincing one's self of behaviour and attitude that allows them to essentially make up their own rules and do whatever they want, so long as they pray or pay penance (with self harm), with men being above all else and only answerable to 'God'. Not for the faint-hearted, but eye-opening all the same."
" Inspiration for suicide
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,1,"What a nightmarish blend of hopelessness, graphic violence, incest, sexual deviance and cruelty towards women and children. I hated this movie and my two male friends got up and left around the 30 minute mark, refusing to watch it further. I, like a fool, kept holding out for a moral reckoning and justice which never materialized. Just a God awful, depressing, soul sucking waste of film. Do yourself a favor. Don't waste one moment of your life on this sick, twisted mess."
" Waste of time.
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,1,"About religion? Horrendous, sickening violence and perversion. Not worth the time to watch. I think the writer must have some problems."
" Once again, forget the idiots that give this 1 star.
",2018-04-04 00:00:00,8,"My god this is becoming a serious problem on this site. Whether they are religious or just plain narrow minded (or both) i can only assume.
Maybe you were expecting a PG drama? Do a tiny google search for crying out loud. 
This a slow thriller. It starts off slowly, and doesn't tell you everything until about half way through.
Brilliant performance by Guy Pearce. Seriously some of his best ever work. This is a sick, violent & very well made R rated thriller.
Once again i must implore among the people reading these reviews to not pay attention to religious fanatics down voting this movie. 
Oh no, there's a crazy perverted priest. Not a priest..
History is full of religious wars, priests preying on the weak and innocent. If there was no religion, the world would be a far, far better place in my opinion. 
All it does is divide people and create war. Sure, i know plenty of fantastic people who are religious. But like any race/religion we all have a mix of beautiful & ugly people.
Back to the movie..
For the first 20-30mins you will be saying to yourself ""What the **** is going on?""
But trust me, you will be rewarded. Half way through, the movie delves into the past and explains everything. 
A very, very solid & savage thriller. My favorite type of movie :)As per usual on my reviews. Please people, do some homework. I don't enjoy cheesy romance movies, but if i do watch one by accident i don't review it like a piece of garbage. For the genre i'm sure those movies were quite good, even great.. 
Not liking a genre gives you no right to vote/review it. As your opinion is tainted before you even watch it.Dark, gripping, violent, sick & i loved every minute of it."
" Disgusting
",2018-04-03 00:00:00,7,A very disgusting movie . Done well but the reverent is a sick man
" this is complicated..
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,6,"Not bad, not good. it is a good drama, but with many flaws. dakota and guy are great actors, but i find the plot appealing TOO MUCH. about kit harington: the impression is that they put him in the cast just to fill sausage, unfortunately nothing had to add useful to the plot."
" My opinion about the film
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,9,"Dakonta is very good in this role, the development of the film is very good to say that it is really a good director. At first it may not be easy for many to see if everything is clear and you know that the interesting story is going forward. That's exactly what is waiting for the end and with great interest. You are involved in the film and think of the priestly clergy."
" Unrealistic
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,4,"Nicely directed. Beautiful country settings and quality stage setup. Very well acted with talented actors. Bad writing. It's a shame. Not a bad movie if you like fantasy, but it is listed as drama/western. Everything there for a great movie except a good story. Could not believe anything close to this could happen in a real world. Maybe a good movie for kids."
" Emotional and Demanding
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,8,"I guess i could say it too. Its Dark. But then i would describe it more Emotionally demanding and its gruesome. Some stories just need to be, because of their nature. And keeping in mind this is on Western time era. Its just natural that its more grinding. This movie is definately one of those kind that is not easy to watch. Per se if you have more emotions than a piece of stone chip. It wont be easy..
And battle of ""good and evil"" is always some bloody too. But more of any its Survival story. I can find it realistic as in realife it can be very hard on many levels. So it definately can be that in movies..
Acting is great, and actors/actresses deliver their nuances fine way.
All in all this flick may be what you are looking for if you like story that keeps you in its grasp. And youre not too faint hearted. Then other hand. If you have soft inner mind it could make you cry. Or its psychological aspects at least."
" Don't watch this, please don't watch this
",2018-03-14 00:00:00,2,"Do Not waste ur time. I don't know what I was expecting, but I did not expect this. I'm sorry, I'm shaking my head so fervently I can't type. Ok, to be fair the acting was pretty good. That's literally the only good thing about this. I didn't care that it was written in 3 acts, but I did care that for some reason it was out of order. It didn't add to the story at all. Another thing, it was grossly overwritten. They added so many scenes that were not necessary for storytelling. A good director and good writer know how to relay a story without building an entire 15 minute scene to convey a mood. It makes all the difference and given that this movie's well over 2 hrs long should tell u something. I can't believe how they ended it, I literally cannot believe it. It was the movie that wouldn't end no matter how much you want it to. It just kept going and going, one twist into another twist into another. Ugg. The scenes weren't horribly graphic thank God especially given the fact that there's rape, incest other brutal injuries. The production was good, but not good enuff to make a difference. This is such a poor waste of acting talents. They got some really hot actors in this too, how did they possibly do that? Ugh!!!!!! This movie pisses me off!! Just another typical sexploitation, only without any satisfaction in the end. I feel like I need a bath now. This movie is just gross."
" Not worth watching
",2018-03-13 00:00:00,1,"This movie is that bad. 
The director liked ""Memento"" so he casts Guy Pearce, and tells the movie in reverse. He likes ""Game of thrones"" so he casts some GOT actors...
The story is slow, unerving.
Only upside is Guy Pearce's ability to nail the Dutch accent.Now if watching some peadopheliac pig drool over his daughter is your thing, then you might enjoy this; otherwise, stay away frim it"
" Great Movie!
",2018-03-13 00:00:00,10,"I have nothing to say except it's the best movie I've seen in the last 5 years - real 
POWERFUL movie!
A kind of movie that you are going to think about even some days later! I really can't understand a few reviews I've read here like: ""Depressing"", ""Dark"" etc.... - You can't watch a comedy movie and complain - ""It's too much funny"", Right??"
" One of the worst films I've ever seen.
",2018-03-03 00:00:00,1,"An absolute horror of a film, and not in the way it would like to be. It's so bad it has driven me to sign up and review it.From a dreadful script, wooden acting, preposterous contrived story line and almost impressively bad cinematography considering the setting, there was simply no redeeming feature of this film.Bad, bad, bad."
" Relentless Brutality
",2018-02-08 00:00:00,5,"A well made movie that was nonetheless, difficult to watch due to relentless brutality. During one scene a pig is first shot in the head, and then it's throat is cut. It lies on the ground with it's legs moving for a long time in the background. I try to avoid movies where animals were actually killed in real life for the film. The violence against women in the movie was non-stop and maddening. Overall it was not a pleasant experience and I was left asking what was the point?"
" Wowzee
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,10,"In the beginning I thought this movie was about a preacher coming to town and doing some reformation...no no no. I don't understand the current rating 7,1 or something, I almost didn't watch the movie. I am glad I did, I think this movie deserves a far better rating. The movie has a story (refreshing) and I love how it is pieced together. It has some violent scenes but, if you have the stomach for example the movie seven, the scenes will not upset you. One of the best in a while."
" Brimstone
",2018-01-26 00:00:00,9,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off the story is one of the most intriguing, dark, depressing, and outright sadistic story's I have ever seen. The power behind the plot is incredibly strong. The grittiness and brutal tone make the film extremely entertaining. My eyes could not leave the screen. The ending left me stunned and shocked at how a masterpiece could be disliked by the critics.The acting all around is very good. Guy Pearce, Dakota Fanning, Kit Harington, Carice van Houten, Ivy George, Paul Anderson, and William Houston all do a great job at portraying their respective characters. The weakest performance goes to Jack Hollington who is dry and emotionless. The best performance goes to Emilia Jones. She has such power and grace in her performance. She makes you connect to her and almost makes you fell her struggle. The pacing is perfect. The film is separated into four chapters that perfectly fit together. The runtime is also perfect. By the time the credits rolled I wanted more.The violence is at times extremely brutal but it symbolizes the harshness of the world the characters live in.Pros: Intriguing, brutal, and shocking story, great acting, an outstanding performance by Emilia Jones, perfect pacing, gritty and consistent tone, and a perfect use of violence and nudity that furthers the storyCons: A poor performance by Jack Hollington and the dislocating shoulders scene which didn't make much sense (I didn't put this in the review because it would be a spoiler)Overall Rating: 9.4P.S. This film has been added to my favorite films of all time list. The story is powerful and left he stunned. This film is a must see."
" structure siphons off tension
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,5,"Liz (Dakota Fanning) is a midwife in the harsh old west. She is mute from the lost of her tongue and adversed to guns. She is horrified with the arrival of the new Reverend (Guy Pearce). Her fears are dismissed by her husband but he turns out to be a murderous psychopath. Joanna (Emilia Jones) is a teen girl found wandering in the desert and sold into prostitution.The opening Liz section is fine. It has a gothic epic feel although it does come off a little artificial. She could have been more convincing to her husband about the Reverend's evilness. She could have lied at least. It's one of those holding back information plot device and it feels manufactured. The second section with Joanna is awkward at first and the reveal is obvious before its actual reveal. It becomes obvious with the points where the plot must hit. The tension is siphoned off. When another reveal suggests a further connection, I feared a prequel to the prequel. Sure enough, that's what we get. Essentially, the tension is stripped out of the middle as the audience waits to return to Liz. The structure causes problems which may be covering even further underlying problems. I like Fanning and the evilness of Pearce if only the middle didn't drag so much."
" Hard hard to watch!
",2018-01-20 00:00:00,5,"My only comment is.........what did the Kit Harrington role have to do with anything in this movie? Did they just want to give him a part?
Funny the two cowboys were staying in the barn but the mother and preacher never saw them. Does anybody review these movies to see if the story line makes sense?"
" Great cinematography and an impressively committed performance from Guy Pearce are not enough to make this memorable.
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,6,"As a movie there is plenty of impressive things about Brimstone. For one its an ambitious movie with how it try's to tackle its big story (dividing into four parts played out of sequence). However It doesn't really feel necessary to be non chronological when watching it, but it does lend itself to some pretty good reveals here and there. I for one would have found the movie better if it just stuck to the first and last chapter and had some of the backstory explained cleverly with good dialogue. This would have made the movie tighter and less lengthy. Some other impressive things about it are its production design, cinematography, and performances by its entire cast. Special mention must go to veteran actor Guy Pearce who gives an impressively committed performance as per usual. Always the chameleon, Pearce disappears completely into the role and he is what makes this movie most memorable. With that being said his character as well as most characters in this movie are fairly one dimensional and lack depth. Maybe make his villain a little less evil with a sympathetic side and maybe make Fanning's protagonist role a little less perfect and add a darker side. Just a thought, but as an aspiring screenplay writer I find its a good idea to add as much dimension to your characters as possible to make them not feel so black and white.Another problem I had with this movie was the way it went over the top with its extreme violence and sadism. They could have just as easily made their point (whatever it was) without excessive gore. Here are a couple examples...In part one of the movie a character is stabbed by The Reverend but instead of just having him be stabbed and bleeding to death we see his intestines have been brutally ripped out of him and wrapped around his neck like a noose. I don't see how that was necessary except for shock value. In fact this movie riddled with shock value and it makes me think that i'm watching a B rate horror film as opposed to a western thriller which is not a good thing. Another example is in a couple places in the movie a young girl is horribly whipped (yet again by The Reverend) It didn't add to the story it just made it uncomfortable. In summary Brimstone is a good movie with plenty of potential for greatness but unfortunately it squanders that potential with excessive violence/sadism, and a drawn out story with too long a run time. Shame, it could have been something special with a little more focus."
" Great Story
",2018-01-06 00:00:00,9,"--The story as general is about liz the survivor who is hunted by a vengeful preacher in the old west in america because of a crime she didn't commit.--This artwork is characterized by it dark story and the violence by it two faces Physical and Verbal.--Also the movie,most of it time, playing with your emotions.Sometimes make you sympathetic and sometime the opposite.--The Cinematographic has a great roll to make the movie more darker if you notice the whole movie had filmed at night, dark places like the church and houses or cloudy places like the farm.--Now The acting, the three main Characters have mastered their rolls. Guy Pearce(as the reverend), Dakota Fanning(as the survivor young lady""liz"") and Kit Harrington(as Samuel)."
" Very Tragic! *WARNING SPOILERS*
",2018-01-06 00:00:00,10,"This movie was very sad wrenching and heart pumping. I like the way they jumped around to different pivotal moments in her life and the way they did the movie out of sequence somehow it brought everything full circle and everything made sense at the end. Very creative movie and Dakota Fanning killed this role. She proved she's not just the child actress. How ever this movie is an after the children go to bed movie it is very graphic with an extreme amount of adult language. It broke my heart at the end. She finally got free from her preacher dad just to be arrested for a murder that the real Liz committed right before she died and Joanna stole her identity. She is executed at the end. So no matter how much she struggled and all tha she went through She is killed for a crime she didn't even commit. I love this movie, I would recommend this movie to anyone except children lol. I gave it 10 Stars for the reason being that it was very creative and very good film."
" Depressing, victimizing and disjointed
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,1,I thought that this movie would be at least entertaining with Guy and Kit in it ut it was not. It was just depressing. It does not empower women in any way! All it did was victimize them as much as possible and put the male perspective right up front. Poor men who cant get any sex or just do what they want even if it is raping children and killing them. SICK movie and I just cannot believe this crap is still being made!!

" when the beauty and cruelty replaced any substance
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,4,"It's a mere poorly told, long, and predictable movie that lacks any substance or common sense. The characters' development was replaced with the horrible cruelty and beautiful shots of the wild west. What is the story about? What was the point of it? Was it about the retribution? I didn't get it. Or was it about Joanna? She didn't change much since she was a 13yo girl observing her father mistreated her mom."
" Depressing but well acted
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,3,"Okay......I wasn't expecting a Disney flick......But I certainly did not expect the abject depression and emotional darkness of this film......Kudos to the cast. Bravo! Kudos to the Special Effects artists....I don't believe gunshot wounds and stabbings have ever been so effectively portrayed......Perhaps my biggest complaint with the film was the obvious cruelty to an animal in a particular scene......If this was done with digital or mechanical effects......then I stand meekly apologetic.....the ""gag"" certainly had the desired effect on this particular animal lover.....I couldn't really enjoy the film after that scene, and if the animal was indeed sacrificed for the film, then may the producer, director, crew, and actors all reap their just desserts in the after-life....
All and all, a valiant effort to turn over about every stone, unearth every moral taboo, and shine a blinding light on the ""true"" reality of the Old West!!! It was a nasty place.......Add the good acting, marvelous effects and camera work, and a bit of fire and (forgive the pun) ""Brimstone"" horror - and you have movie......Just don't go into thinking your gonna have fun-time after the show.......it will haunt you!!"

",2017-12-28 00:00:00,10,"Watched it several times story is great and it keep you wonder till the end.
A triumphant epic of survival and a tale of powerful womanhood and resistance against the unforgiving cruelty of a hell on earth. Our heroine is Liz (Dakota Fanning), carved from the beautiful wilderness, full of heart and grit, hunted by a vengeful Preacher (Guy Pearce) - a diabolical zealot and her twisted nemesis. But Liz is a genuine survivor; she's no victim - a woman of fearsome strength who responds with astonishing bravery to claim the better life she and her daughter deserve. Fear not. Retribution is coming."
" Director needs to review classic cinema, and get some therapy...
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,1,"Judas Priest this is an infuriating film. Chiefly responsible for this are a host of visually compelling, masterfully constructed set designs, costumes, solid acting and cinematography that are thoroughly wasted here as this film plays host to some of the most moronically vile males and pathetically weak female characters ever seen on a screen. Brimstone goes WAY beyond being 'merely' misogynistic, It relishes in both torturing its wrongfully accused female protagonist, (Dakota Fanning) and robbing her of any discernible empowerment in virtually every single scene, dramatic arc, & plot twist as she fights to flee a menacing extremist bent on her eternal cleansing. Further, it's painfully obvious this film's producers are intent in manufacturing their own insidiously twisted, murky, and supremely ugly take on Christianity. Having been raised Mormon myself, I know only too well the pitfalls of the 'Fundamentalist agenda,' and yes organized religion in America has been plagued with rocky roads from the beginning. This film however simply tries too hard with sensationally unrealistic, abrupt story arcs which are far too 'agenda pushing' to be taken seriously. For several years I've relished in the beautiful Carice van Houton and her supremely gifted acting chops and must admit she was a primary draw for wanting to see this mess. Having waited for nearly an hour and a half before she appears, one can only surmise that a solid paycheck coupled with the chance to get beaten up by her current companion, co-star Guy Pearce (as the thoroughly one-note extremist bad-guy) must have harbored some allure because she is wasted here. This cinematic tripe also shamefully stoops to authentic, on camera animal slaughter. Clearly QUALITY scripts are getting harder and harder to come by. Many of todays' cinematic auteurs are not doing their homework by savoring the classics and learning what constitutes quality story telling. Instead they've chosen to skip it and barrel straight into a more unabashed propensity for cheap shots and shock value over all else. Shock value alone does not a quality film make. Ensuring EVERY SINGLE COMPONENT of your film is top drawer is pointless without a well written script, and some semblance of humanity."
" Disgusting!

But Christians know it's just perverted fiction."

",2017-12-13 00:00:00,8,"Evil is there in the church, in the reverend. Great acting and no hiding violence and sex much, the story is very well casted. Great acting. Great images. Great story line, epic, spanning some decades. The reverend is a psychopath akin of the Terminator 2 model liquid metal. He kills easily and efficiently but is hard to kill. His daughter goes to great length to escape. The film is a good representation of psychopathy, to which the reverend is a typical extreme example. He can't know love, only abuse. His life is hell no matter what. His quote: In hell, it's not the fire that is painful, it's the lack of love. 
This film is haunting and only a few bits are pushed too much to the point of ridicule. The gun to shoot pigs is reported as goof. The wife hanging in the church is over the top and reminiscent of Clockwork Orange. The grandfather killing is too easy and noiseless to be believed."

But you see it is labeled as horror, or just thriller even, but does it deliver in such way? Will you get any suspense, intrigue, will you ever hold your breath? No! Most certainly no such thing will occur. What you will get instead are torture and porn in every single chapter of the movie. And it thrives on it, like a wolf in sheep clothes, pretending to be something it is not while it acts almost like a snuff movie. Very disappointing approach the director took here and I'm sadden by the fact that he managed to get away with it.I noticed it was well received in Europe and surprise surprise, America was the one to point the finger, righteously, as Brimstone will try to shock you with gore, bent values, no morals whatsoever and torture all the way. All the way! You will not believe how low it will sink in order to steal your attention and make you feel something but for the very wrong reasons. Now here is where you have to pay attention: plenty of folks out there are die hard fans of a very similar movie called Martyrs. These two are somehow different than others like Serbian Film, so don't get the styles confused, but don't think you'll see anything too different either. If Martyrs was the film for you then be prepared to see something perhaps slightly better developed. You could enjoy it.For me it was a huge disappointment. One or two steps away from Human Centipede. Such movies don't belong on the screen.Cheers!"
" Brutal misogynism
",2017-11-29 00:00:00,7,"I have to say this movie made me furious and very sad. Especially in light of all the sexual misconduct in the news today. That being said the acting is extraordinary and I really enjoyed this movie. Dakota fanning did a remarkable job of expressing dialogue and emotion with very few spoken lines. Guy Pierce was amazing although I hated his character with a passion as the epitome of perverted evil. This film really brings to light the evil of uncontested blind following of religious leaders. An individual leader does not necessarily reflect the belief of the entire faith and we should always ""question"". All my completely biased opinions being given. This is a great movie"
" Wow, just wow..
",2017-11-28 00:00:00,9,"This movie lasted for 2 hours, 20 mins (excluding the credits here). I actually took a break after Chapter-2 and was shocked how long the movie was. Do note, I did not check the time cause I was bored. This movie is worth sitting through.The amazing acting, the violence, the religious bullshit on full display.. all of it immerses you as a viewer, into the life of a tortured woman whose whole life was filled with pain and suffering. I don't really wanna spoil any of it because this movie has a simple plot, but it's the execution that really shines (from director and actors).Though I must say, I DO love the fact that this made the American religious nutcases so uncomfortable, that they rated this movie down to oblivion. I guess when someone puts a mirror to your faith and shows you how backward and horrifying it can be, just like other Abrahamic faiths (Islam), you start kicking and screaming like kids.The same Americans who are happy with banning sex in games and movies, while being OK with violence and guns, did not like this movie at all. I wonder why? Here's the best part. People like the reverend in this movie, still exist (priests, mullahs, popes, whatever you wanna call them). Their victims still live the lives of female characters in this movie. Religion is a gift that keeps on giving.Watch this movie, it's worth it."
" An exercise in misery
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,4,"Only a few famous cinematic figures can get away with using their surname only when headlining a poster or introducing a movie's title. Schwarzenegger and Stallone get away with it, as would the likes of Spielberg, Kubrick and Hitchcock if they were that way inclined. In an incredible display of confidence in his work, Dutch director Martin Koolhoven opens his latest film with the title of 'Koolhoven's Brimstone', a brave move for a filmmaker few outside of the Netherlands will have heard of. He clearly takes himself very seriously, and Brimstone just may be the most serious film of the year in the way the director soaks the film with such a biblical doom-and-gloom atmosphere that it would be difficult to watch without a chin-stroke or two.Focusing on the life of a young mute woman named Liz, played by Dakota Fanning, in a particularly brutal Old West, Brimstone is a commentary on both the strength of woman and the sadistic nature of man. Liz holds a position of respect in the town due to her midwifing skills, but when a problematic birth leads to a decision between mother or baby, she is targeted by the residents as a murderer. Things get worse when The Reverend (Guy Pearce) walks into town. He is a stoic, imposing figure eager to reinforce God's fury to his congregation, and expects total obedience in return. Liz clearly shares a history with him, and is eternally terrified in his presence. This is the first of four stories played out of order, flashing back to Liz's time in a brothel under the orders of violent owner Frank (Paul Anderson), and forward again as Liz tries to escape the clutches of The Reverend.At first, the non-linear narrative structure is interesting, unfolding the story carefully in order to reveal truths that change your outlook of the story. When the film finished, it felt as though it was a mere distraction from the boring central plot. Brimstone is a film about punishment, and the 149-minute running-time seems like a deliberate choice from the director to punish us in the process. It's a gruelling watch; alongside the violence and misogyny of many of its characters, there's also paedophilia, rape, incest, infanticide and hangings. It seems to wallow in the very things it is rallying against, particularly an uncomfortable scene in which The Reverend humiliates his wife (played by Carice van Houten) and forces her to wear a metal bridle in an attempt to destroy her. Things liven up slightly when Kit Harington's injured outlaw arrives on the scene, but by this point you'll be too beaten down by the relentless atmosphere for it to make much of a difference. Brimstone is bold and will likely provoke discussion, but ultimately little more than an exercise in misery."
" A Reflection Of The Industry's Accepted Abuse!
",2017-11-24 00:00:00,1,"Spoiler Alert: Really?? What this movie proved to me is that this present society, within and outside the movie industry have not learned a single thing from our history or present day news. Why else would free women and civilized men praise a movie about a little girl and woman being sexually abused, beaten, and silenced. Why would anyone call this ""Art""! The main character lives in fear and runs from her evil abuser. Yet, She never warns a single soul about who he is and what he is capable of doing, even to those she loves dearly. The viewer is tricked, played by the reversal of the order of events, not through flashbacks! But by the mixed-up chapters. The people in the church never ask a single question or even look shocked from the actions of the self proclaimed GOD/leader even when the evidence of his EVIL is right in front of them. Sound a little like the recent news? I sat through it hoping the protagonist would do something, anything unpredictable. Instead, I watched her continue on as the never ending victim for years on end. So at last I became a victim to a movie lacking any creativity, lesson, or beauty. I'm sure the perverted producers, directors, actors, politicians and masked men out there found it extremely appealing though, because it is so sickeningly brutal in it's perverted and violent detail. Child abuse and sexual harassment won't stop until we stop accepting and paying to watch their explicit child abuse in their movies!"
" A young woman endures unspeakable horrors at the hands of a ruthless Man of God in the Old West.
",2017-11-22 00:00:00,1,"Felt like I needed a shower after struggling through this one - relentlessly brutal and pointless, made more so by the strong production values and acting. Most revenge Westerns have a couple of terrible scenes to set up the payoff, this one probably has a dozen. But don't take my word for it. If murder, self-mutilation, rape, sodomy, incest, torture, bondage, public humiliation, senseless cruelty and violence are your thing, this will be your Best Picture of the Year. I wished I was the favorite hog that gets slaughtered, at least it was put out of its misery before The Reverend turned his ""Sword of God"" on it."
" This Movie is Pure Evil!
",2017-11-21 00:00:00,1,"I couldn't finish this movie. It was not worth allowing the utter hopelessness, anger and despair that i felt while watching to consume me just to see the ending. However it ended, i know it wouldn't be enough to wash away the stain that it left on my soul. This movie is pure witchcraft! I have never watched a movie that so DEEPLY disturbed me. Who is acquainted with such evil that they can make a movie to perfectly capture, manifest and transmit it? SORCERY! Movies are for entertainment, they aren't real, but this film crossed the line!"
" It's pure and simple sadistic and irresponsible misogynist filmmaking.
",2017-11-21 00:00:00,1,"I wish I could leave a worse rating than 1 but then 1 it is.I don't remember seeing a film so misogynist or sadistic as this one.The director basically shows you violence against women on the screen for as long as he thinks he can get away with (and trust me, it's a lot).It's completely pointless, doesn't help any one and doesn't really shine a light into another era's social relations or anything.All that it does is probably appease the filmmakers inner lust for hurting women on screen as he probably doesn't do it in real life.It's pure and simple sadistic and irresponsible filmmaking.The worse thing about it is that I believe the filmmakers probably think they are making a film against violence to women.In fact they end up promoting it by making it happen over and over and over again, desensitising their audience and showing how most people may actually get away with it.I wish I had never seen it and that people think twice and do their homework before they go on blindingly doing films about sensitive issues."
" Very solid, powerful movie
",2017-11-13 00:00:00,9,"It s been years since i saw a movie this good. Yes it s violent, but has to be to make it believable. The movie keeps you in suspense the whole time. The acting was very solid. Dakota fanning does An excellent performance as a mute, and i get the creeps from guy Pierce 's ""reverend""-caracter. The way the Bible is interpreted as it suits the reverend is very recognizable in today's world, as it was in the past . An absolute must-see! You won t be sorry"
" I became a feminist for 2 and a half an hour
",2017-11-04 00:00:00,7,"The other reviewers described the movie precisely: Dark, ruthless, without any love anywhere.I felt writing this review for another relevant point: Females suffered those times. They suffered a lot. In this movie you will feel the culmination of all derogatory and disparaging treats to women. This feeling emerges as a side effect of all the scenes. It is the by-product of the religion, ignorance, and power exercise. Another brilliant piece of art urging reformation of the societal morals.I just wished that the retribution scene in the end wasn't so unrealistic. I do not understand why the director had to make it complicated near the end. That's the only reason I rated 7 and not 9 points. But in any case the movie provides substance to refresh our memory about the dark parts of our past. Watch and ponder!"
" Waste of time
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,1,"The quality of the actors is incredible. In general the movie is a waste of time, I have not found a reason why it was worth it see it. From beginning to end predictable, it's not surprising, the Director is lacking originality. There are plenty of scenes and actors that do not meet no function in the plot. The lack of a plot consistent, the lack of originality and the predictability make it a low quality film. Not recommended."
" Not special as it shows.
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,6,"The story begins very well and I really enjoyed it. But it was very unfortunate to see the main character doing ridiculous choices all over the movie. This is the movie that can pi** you off many times without any doubt. And this is not good. The reasoning behind all of the main character decisions is very shallow. And at some part of the movie, I really believed she deserves it!"
" A depiction of ultimate psychopathic self-justification?
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,5,"As others have already noted, the acting in Brimstone is simply phenomenal, especially that of Pierce. I don't remember ever seeing an actor become so completely transformed into a character. And a terrifying character, at that. Both Pierce and Fanning give master level performances. Even as the reverend continually descended into more and more more depraved and disgusting acts, I couldn't stop watching this film. I sort of felt dirty afterwards, and perhaps that was the intention.However, I ask, what was the purpose of the degree of darkness and misanthropy depicted here? I don't know if there was an intentional effort to negatively paint Judaism and/or Christianity as inherently prone to producing this sort of a mad man, or if was the result of the belief that the male sex is the problem, or if it was a general depiction of an example of the ability of a human being to engage in the ultimate psychopathic self-justification by seizing upon a belief system and rationalizing and twisting it into whatever is needed to satisfy one's ego.I couldn't really recommend this film to anyone I know, as they would not be willing to even try to understand what this is all about. It sort of reminds me of The Revenant, not only in its brutality, but its cinematography."
" The trouble that had never let her alone.
",2017-10-13 00:00:00,7,"A story about America, Hollywood cast, but produced and directed by outsiders. A powerful film. Kind of mix of 'No Country for Old Man' and 'Les Miserables'. The narration divided into four parts. The first episode called Revelation. An introduction life around Liz, but full of suspense after every unexpected turn in the story. Then in the second episode called Exodus, a young girl, Joanna introduced and following the third knows as Genesis, goes ever further back into Joanna's life, before returning to Liz's in the fourth known as Retribution.Maybe Dakota's best performance being an adult actress. As well as the young actress Emilia Jones. They both had played the same character, but in a different timeline. Interestingly, in real life, they share the same birth day and month as mine. From one of the film poster, I thought it was Michael Sheen. Only realised while watching the film that it was Guy Pearce. From writing to the making, it was a very good film. But the story could make some people uneasy. Because everything that's happened between the people and their relationship, not for soft guys. Yet it is a must see thriller, a must see western.7/10"
" Smart and highly memorable
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,9,"For me to enjoy a longer movie (anything pushing 150 minutes) is rare. Some of my favourite movies also happen to be around that run time, but when a movie is that long and you're not enjoying it it can be absolutely punishing. Fortunately, I thoroughly enjoyed 'Brimstone'. In fact I'd go as far as to say I loved it. The film is crafted exquisitely. It's broken up into four chapters, and each one of them is as strong and intriguing as the last.The weaving of the story and the time pieces is masterfully done. The story starts with a mystery of sorts and then is revealed to us with a reverse time line. Of course once one thing is revealed to us another mystery is opened up and henceforth the formula goes. There is a lot of intelligence and thoughtfulness put into this script, that much can't be doubted.The cast also do a wonderful job of selling the whole premise. The stand-out for me was Guy Pearce. He was captivating to watch and I thought he nailed the Dutch accent (something he claims was very hard to do). Not far behind him was Dakota Fanning. She had a very different type of role, a role that could be considered a lot harder to pull off, and she too got it spot on. I mention those two in particular, but it has to be said the entire cast was fantastic. There wasn't a weak-link among them.There's a lot to love here. There are some scenes of brutal violence that are incredibly powerful and will stick with me for a long time. There are also a lot of implied messages along the way too which I really enjoyed. As previously mentioned this is a very smart film, even smarter than some may give it credit for. I would thoroughly recommend giving it a watch."
" A very dark movie, I would not recommend watching when you are in a bad mood.
",2017-10-06 00:00:00,8,"Again As I described in the title , this is a very ""Film Noir "" , it is in most parts infuriating , it shows a kind of old west we have rarely seen in westerns & in films in general ( at least for me) .*** The injustice done to women is very atrocious.One marking moment in the movie for me is when you realize that a murderer & thief have more honor & decency that a man of the cloth.The reverend keeps on quoting the scripture about false prophets & wolves in sheep's clothing , oblivious to the fact that he is what he describes. Definitely a film to watch , but be in a good mind set for it."
" Chilling
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,8,Very dark movie. I think it's a bit of punch in the face (the fist being the things and helplessness suffered). I can't even imagine what sort of horrors beside what we see in this film women and children should've lived at the time and before that. Guy Pearce's and Dakota's jobs are great.
" Not for faint hearted people
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,10,"Kinda late to review here but couldn't resist myself. This movie might be disturbing for some people, however one can also say that this is the perfect blend of horror, thriller and action genre. I am surprised to see why it hasn't been AT LEAST nominated for some top movie awards (perhaps it may offend a larger section of people who considers Ironman/Hulk real ... Just kidding).Now coming to the main points, the PLOT was amazing. The whole movie is written in neo-noir style which is also known as Quentin Tarantino genre. The movie is used to show how deviant people used religion as a shield to justify their heinous crimes.The acting was superb. How the hell Guy Pearce was not nominated for an Oscar for this movie (again it's my opinion) ??? At the end of the movie, I found him more DESPICABLE than the combination of Ramsay Bolton & Joffrey. Dakota Fanning was amazing in her role as well. From a helpless girl to strong-willed mother, Fanning has acted brilliantly, considering her entire performance was based on facial expressions. Other casts such as Kit Harrington, Carice Von Houten, Emilia Jones were amazing as well.The movie is slow and over 2 hours length. But trust me at the end, you'll learn that reality is not always what most movies show. The society we live in may not have God's angels, probably none. It may be dwelled by evil people, who will try to harm you. But it's your choice how you defend against them. You may stand as Anna, or you may stand as Joanna/Liz to fight them.Lastly, I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone. Believe me, it's disturbing in its own way. I was saddened for an entire evening after watching this one."
" Due for a stoning
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,4,"This review of Brimstone is spoiler free** (2/5)THERE'S A SHORT yet successfully fertile history of European directors tackling the Western genre, a phenomenon which has on occasion produced memorably unorthodox imagery of a perhaps mythological American past. Dutch writer-director Martin Koolhoven takes on this lineage with his English-language debut Brimstone. However this nature of a traditionally stunning narrative is short lived as he spends most of the film's punishing 148 minute runtime inflicting humiliation and trauma upon his female characters. A film populated by yellow-toothed, slightly feral, vilely perverse men preying on women for pleasure. As a plot the film is split into four chapters each named from Biblical terms there's Revelations, Exodus, Genesis and Retribution, in each of these chapters you're plunged into the story of Guy Pearce's vengeful Reverend and Dakota Fanning's mute midwife Liz. His story is filled with revenge and hate after losing his wife and seeing his daughter escape from his clutches. He listens to the word of God enforcing pain on the people mainly women who betray him, by using each chapter of the story he enforces a new method of torture, each more brutal than the last. Liz's story is perhaps the easiest journey, in the beginning of the film she's a mute midwife happily married to Eli (William Houston), hers is a modest lifestyle working with her young daughter to deliver babies across town. As soon as the new reverend comes in she's terrified of him, and as the film progresses her story comes to play. In the 2nd and 3rd chapters her life opens up, as a teenager played by Emilia Jones she learns about the values of being a woman constantly plagued by pain. This comes at a use to her later. Her performance though mostly mute is fantastic, the emotions that she goes through aren't expressed by voice, her facial expressions contain the most emotion whether she's panicked, terrified or shocked - each emotion gradually paints a picture of her pain. A brave and honest performance which gives little polish. Unfortunately this is soon dragged down by Pearce's flagitious villain. The usually reliable Pearce is compounded by Koolhoven's poorly written dialogue and an iffy Dutch accent which produces little fire from his veteran face. But you'd need to have some strong resolve, and perhaps need a strong stomach to match it. As Koolhoven desperately tries to give Brimstone the same audience-unfriendly measures from Lars von Triers' Breaking the Waves or perhaps Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight except without any of the intricate storytelling or indeed any of the complex characters attached. In short, this is a poorly handled, poorly written Western which sacrifices good storytelling for the glorification of suffering women. VERDICT Passable in the storytelling of the two leads but in the end this brutally hellish Western ponders along with female abuse and not much else."
" Wow... Ridiculous
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,1,"I really don't write many reviews but, having just watched Brimstone, I couldn't help it... Let me just say that I'm a big horror fan and have absolutely no problem with violence or gore in movies, even if used only for shock value, IF it's done right. This of course is not a horror film by any means. It's a wannabe thriller with no point, no message and, worst of all, the director is trying to make you believe it has the depth of a Tarkovsky film. It makes no sense in terms of character development - the main female character, who has witnessed and also committed horrible acts of violence, who has been tortured by her deranged perverted father, who had the guts to cut her own tongue out at one point just to be able to fake her identity, suddenly becomes a scared little bunny when the main villain who had destroyed her life finds her again and wants to keep tormenting her... She takes no action whatsoever which, by this point in her story would be highly unlikely... She doesn't even warn her family that the new reverand is basically the boogie man. I mean, the guy survived getting his throat slit wide open, entered the house somehow (while the female protagonist was guarding the only door) and murdered her father in law in complete silence, than magically appeared in front of her, then kept it cool and motionless and even remained talkative while being lit on fire... If this was supposed to be a supernatural thriller, it certainly wasn't convincing, since this super villain died way too quickly in the end. All of the violence is mostly against women, and the end didn't feel redeeming at all - hardly any retribution really... So many bs religious references, attempts at survival genre, elements of horror, thriller, western, drama, 12,000,000 budget - all for nothing. If some violent movies such as Hostel or The Human Centipede at least offer shallow entertainment due to the dark humor, this movie takes itself so seriously that even the supposedly ""shocking"" violence leaves no impression. I'm not even going to get into script flaws (for example how the reverand decides to rent the whole bordello for some reason so that nobody catches him doing it (also in another town) then just happens to instead stumble upon his daughter that just happens to now work in that particular town at that bordello, and it all happens precisely on the very last day before she is supposed to run away... I mean, my god... etc......) Don't watch this film - not because it's violent, iconoclastic or upsetting (they just want you to find it controversial, it's really none of these things). It's just a boring, predictable, pretentious film that has no point and is absolutely empty in every way."
" Good , Dark and Evil
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,8,"To put it simple this is a story about a seriously wicked and evil man . The movie shares this idea that the god is the devil himself The evil is everywhere in the movie . Without spilling much blood it succeeds in making fear creep into your gut . Guy Pearce has done an absolutely brilliant job portraying that wolf which he quotes in his first scene .""Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing.for inwardly, they are ravening wolves"".

Full of plot holes and full of bloody-gore wanna-be-Tarantino scenes, that impress nobody. It's getting worse as the plot unfold and the continuity weakens (The Memento effect was nice to be copied in this one but still) Only the actors (Don't watch it for Carice Van Houten and Kit Harington) and the director really delivered nicely, but they delivered only the awful things the script had for them."
" What was the point of this movie?
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,1,"While very well crafted and well acted , I am just so sick of seeing movies that is purely about degrading woman .Rape, incest , violence against woman through the whole movie , you started to think what kind of sick person has written this crap , it was no message in the movie , just all around depressive.I normally like violent movies but I am sick to death seeing violence against woman , don't they have anything else to offer now days in the film industry ?.I just thought the movie was completely pointless and if you enjoyed seeing it maybe you should ask yourself why ? Why would you enjoy seeing woman brutalised , degraded and raped over and over again as entertainment?"
" Sick
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,1,In trying to outdo Tarantino for shock value the writer and director .... in fact all those involved with this project should take a good look at themselves. Certain actors have reputations that we follow and therefore a responsibility to the public in what they choose to part of. Its pornographic watching and the overriding pedophilia theme is sick in the extreme!
" One of the bleakest films you're ever likely to see
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,4,"I've seen a number of films in my lifetime, more than I'd care to count but there's barely a film that I can recall being bleaker, more downright depressing and genuinely tortuous as Martin Koolhoven's Western epic Brimstone.Without an ounce of light or sunshine for over 140 minutes of runtime, Brimstone's ability to throw its characters and in turn its viewers under the bus time after time is some sort of feat and makes films like Dancer in the Dark and The Boy in the Stripped Pyjamas seem like a walk in the park and in an odd way this makes Brimstone noteworthy for Koolhoven's ability to stay stern in his vision in offering up an unflattering view of humankind, in the unforgiving surrounds of the American wild west.A passion project for the Dutch director and one that he fought hard to have final say over, Brimstone's non-formulaic telling of Dakota Fanning's mute Liz's battle with Guy Pearce's demented, sadistic and purely evil reverend is told in chapters that take us continually back in time too offer an insight into what set up this seemingly endless fight between the two characters, is a narrative that will have many turning off the film before it even threatens to culminate into its long coming conclusion.There's beatings, abuse, animal killings, despicable acts of violence and Kit Harrington's crimes against acting and nothing in Brimstone feels like it was over before we knew it, Koolhoven wants us too feel every little glum moment of these characters torments, both inwardly and outwardly and its within his stoic commitment too not shy away from these atrocities that he draws out a noteworthy turn from his main actresses Dakota Fanning and Emilia Jones as the young Joanna.Often not allowed to act through words, Fanning delivers one of her best turns outside of her early I Am Sam and Man on Fire work while relative newcomer Jones does a fine job of being a part of a narrative that doesn't hold back any of its punches for its young star.Where Brimstone falls down in a major way is with Pearce's turn as the reverend. The Australian actor goes too the store and buys out the deli of ham with his badly Dutch accented, child abusing and Abide with Me Singing maniac. It's not an easy role, Pearce has too act out and deliver some gruelling acts but had the actor or perhaps another performer nailed the role, Brimstone's consistently depressing nature could've been elevated by a great performance of one of recent cinemas most atrocious villains.Final Say – Brimstone is an extremely tough watch, one that will have many unable too bare it and while this sometimes starkly captivating Western like none other is at times haunting in its vision, you can't help but escape the feeling that this harrowing experience isn't worth the arduous journey come the finale, despite the best efforts of its two lead female performers.2 entrails out of 5"
" Brimstoned
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,2,"Within the first few minutes of watching the artistic, way too long, camera shots - with a high dependency on drones, I realised that this was most likely a written and directed by the same person movie. Arrrrgh!When will they learn that they need someone else's artistic direction to tell them that they are making a mistake!When our heroine was standing hidden in the corridor, and the priest was sitting in the lounge room, I knew that if he suddenly, unexpectedly knew she was there, my worst fears had been confirmed. He then said, ""I know you are there"" (paraphrasing). How? Did he have esp? Our writer/director never explains. He/she (as in the director) knows, and we are just expected to accept it.The bad guy certainly seems to always be in the right place at the right time.This film is obviously the directors pet project, and he/she has decided to cut nothing. It is way too long.It is way over the top as well. Why, when the lady falls overboard, in chains, and starts sinking, would anyone shoot at her? Why waste the bullets?Like wise, don't waste your time, and watch something a lot more interesting, like the grass growing outside your house or apartment."

",2017-07-13 00:00:00,9,"Director and writer (story and screenplay) Martin Koolhoven hit this one out of the ballpark!I am not a fan of films that bounce around time lines, nor a fan of a film broken up int 'Acts'. But Martin Koolhoven seemed to mend my two dislikes into this masterpiece! I'd like to go into this a little more, but I'd have to give up too much information, and I don't want to - you must see this to understand what I mean. It's a surprise around every corner for each act!The cinematography, editing and sound were all perfect with the small, and I do mean small exception of the slow pacing. Maybe that was Martins intention, as 2-1/2 hours for 4 acts is not bad, but feel it could have been trimmed down to 2 hours easily and still be just as good if not better with the increase in pace, but that's just my opinion.But the star of this film is none other than Dakota Fanning - wow! She nailed her role and I hope she gets some nominations and wins some awards for her performance.I really want to share more of why I'm so excited over this film, but I know my going into this film knowing nothing is what left me with such a great impact. So do yourself a favor, forget the trailer, avoid the summary/plot and just watch this film.Excellent and a well deserved 9/10!"
" Humanity beyond rock bottom
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,1,"The themes in this film are filthy, visual gore from start to finish. This is not merely a violent film. There is no respite. It gets more and more anguishing, just when you think that would not be possible. The mental cruelty and demented acts of the principle character are made worse by perverted religious themes. The setting was dismal, and instead of entertaining, it was a struggle to endure, and I'm not an overly sensitive viewer. It sticks to you after you watch it, as others have suggested."
" Could have been good but ended up being stupid
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,3,"This movie could have been good,but from things like the wrong guns being used in some parts of the move to the ending being horrifically stupid. A priest who is a pedophile of his own children can not seem to be killed than to being back that idiot at the end as a sheriff and she drowns herself was the worst ending since IT. Two and half hours and it should have been an hour and a half. No redeeming factors in this movie. A woman must have written it as all the men in it were pigs."
" Rubbish movie
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,1,"Terrible movie. Rubbish. Unrealistic. The main character was killed but somehow he survived. How, nobody knows. I am dutch, so i should be proud but instead i am ashamed. What a bullshit that i need to write 5 lines. This film does not decerve 5 lines. No action. What more do you want me to say."
" Horror Movie in a Western Movie Template...Brutal, Bleak, & Unsettling
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,7,"Gruesome Horror/Western about a ""Hell On Earth"" Experienced by Dakota Fanning and others caught up in a Tale of Revenge and Retribution. Fanning is Stalked by a Fallen Angel who uses the Preacher's Robe and the Pulpit to Deceive and wreak Holy Hell, and is a ""False Prophet"" of Doom with Unearthly abilities and Sadistic, Lustful Behavior.Guy Pearce, as the ""Preacher"" seems to be an Unstoppable Whirlwind as He Shows signs of the Miraculous. This can be Witnessed as the Four Chapters Unfold in a Nonlinear 2 1/2 Hours.The Film's European Sensibilities are Evident throughout and give it a Surreal, Otherworldly Quality with Ethereal Images of a Bleak and Snow Covered Wilderness. The Framing is Impeccable and the Visuals are Striking. Even the Brutality.This is a Horror Movie, without doubt, set in the 19th Century American West. There are Numerous Torture Scenes and some Sensitive Types may want to Avoid this Message of a Sadistic, Misogynous Maniac in Sheep's Clothing.The Production Looks Handsome and the Players are Game considering that the Film is ""in your face"" and Unsettling for most of the Long Running Time. Those with a Taste for the Offbeat and the Unconventional will most Likely find this a Rewarding Story."
" A very good film, but harsh and unsentimental
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,8,"I cannot say I really enjoyed watching this film. Not normally what I would describe as entertainment. It takes a toll on you. Pearce turns in a masterful performance as the preacher from hell. He does not have a spiritual bone in his body. He knows absolutely nothing of God. Yet, he seems to fool the masses, who follow him, rather than fire him! He should be run directly out of town, with no hesitation. It is a parable on religion, and the rather blind, sheep like behavior of some practitioners of a rather orthodox, joyless brand of Christianity. If it can be called religion at all. If anything, he could be referred to as a Wahhabi style Christian. This man possesses such deep hatred and such loathing for all things female. And he uses his position of authority to inflict extraordinary amounts of punishment on all of the women who are unfortunate enough, to come within his sad, pathetic, dreadful periphery.The film is beautifully shot in Hungary, Spain and Austria. The acting is exceptional and convincing. Fanning was tremendous. Harrington was good. Pearce was phenomenal. I finished this film, and was about to write a rather critical review of it. Something told me to hold back. By the next day, I had a whole different view of the film, which is often a sign of a very good film. It stayed with me. It had a haunting quality to it, a chilling, mind boggling effect. It feels like real life, in a sense that there are people out there, like this hateful, rat preacher. This film was a very convincing story.Sometimes, it was a little difficult to follow the time line of this film. But, the direction was solid, and the film was quite an impressive effort."
" Buckle up and go see it!
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,9,"Having read nor seen reviews or trailers before watching, Brimstone came in at full force. Though it was at many times unpleasant to watch, I did feel I owed it to the women to see it through. And I am glad I did.Beautifully filmed, deeply haunting and indeed unsettling. But such was life (or rather: could life be) in times where the clergy were law and people feared them as much as they did hell (and therefore did not speak up). I strongly recommend offended viewers to look into our religious history and take note of the many offences and inhumanities women had to go through - and perhaps still go through, may it be in less open/public forms.There is somewhat of a trend in popular culture with exposing the mischiefs of church and clergymen. (In the Western genre, Sweetwater (2013) touches similar themes). But sometimes Christianity is merely used to give people insight in the similarities it has with other emerging (tentatively violent) religions, pointing out to us: we've been there and done that too. I understand that this notion is deeply uncomfortable for some.This story shows clearly however that the restrictions set by religion and the extremity of the measures used to maintain its level of control, always result in the opposite: sheer inhumanity and the pursuit of ones personal desires (albeit justified by bending the rules). From that point of view, Brimstone tells an important tale that should not be ignored without contemplation.Violence throughout the film was harsh, but very often suggested (such as rape) and not shown. This to me indicates that the filmmakers do respect women and merely wish to tell their story. As to the feminist undertone: though we do not feel it, the women do win in the end. Brave as captains who go down with their ship, taking control of their own life and afterlife, therewith objecting to and overruling both men and their silly scriptures.In short: buckle up and go see it!"
" No xmasmovie but a must watch
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,8,Speechless.. It is hard to tell what hit me most in this movie. It felt terrible watching it but I could not pause it either. It is unique.. depressive.. dark.. but violent enough to end up feeling ashamed as a human being. No christmasmovie but a must watch ..allthough for those who can handle it ;-)
" Horrible
",2017-06-15 00:00:00,1,"This movie is horrible, 2hours of my life wasted, I'm not talking about the actors because i think they're good. But the script, oh my god. I wonder what is wrong with the sick people who reviewed this movie as Amazing. The director must be perturbed or sick or very depressed. If you want a movie that: -Everything's goes wrong -You feel sick and depressed. -Leaves you devastated -Dont have a purpose or a lesson to learn -it's nauseating.Go ahead, if you like this movie please seek for help immediately."
" Horrible movie
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,3,"Great talents wasted on horrible story, is there not enough $heet in the world?!I guess if you are masochist aka pain or humiliation give you satisfaction, you could enjoy this, If not avoid this. Apart from story movie is well done, what a waste, violent, dark and depressing. Aftertaste is claustrophobic, just like a rat in a maze of lava. This movie is not fun in any way. I guess it is modern to waste money on movies that have no value.AVOID this movie!"
" Brilliant Heartbreaking Gruesome Satisfying Unsatisfying
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,7,"*** MINOR CONTENT STRUCTURE SPOILERS ***WARNING - This Movie is NOT FOR THE SQUEAMISH !! Don't watch this film and trash it because you were grossed out. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNEDOne of the most memorable scenes in ALL OF MOVIE MAKING EVER. You'll know it when you see it. The hand.The story is excellent. Riveting. Realistic and at the same time over the top. While you can believe any of the events that occur might very well have occurred in that time period under those conditions you will still be shocked repeatedly and to your core. While many scenes are gruesome none of the violence is gratuitous. This statement will confuse many readers but at the same time others will understand what is meant by this seemingly cryptic observation.I believe that chopping up the plot and telling the story backwards was an mistake. This was probably decided in post production during the editing phase to give the final product an uncommon spin. The continuity is compromised and you can tell that the writer/director had not initially intended this delivery. This complaint however does not completely undermine the effectiveness of the story it diminishes it only somewhat. Artistically oriented people will actually enjoy the decision.One significant error I feel was found in the balance between the time spent watching the sympathetic characters get the crap beaten out of them and the time spent seeing the evil antagonists getting their due. It is far to skewed in one direction. It leaves many viewers with a sense that the evil forces almost get away with it for the most part. This doesn't really leave you with a happy satisfied feeling. If you are looking for that from a movie this film won't do it for you. The balance is off in that regard.The quality of the acting, production, and cinematography (which is frequently stunning) is absolutely fantastic. I consider the casting of Dakota Fanning an error. She isn't right for the role except for the fact that her first name has a western feel to it - ha ha. A different actress might have been better. This is only a minor quibble. She did a decent job.Through much of the film this was in my mind an easy 8/10 but when taken in total and especially when considering errors in balance my vote would be a qualified 7/10. For the right people you will love this film. For the wrong people you will despise this film. Extremely polarizing. The people who rated it a 10/10 are being honest as are the people that gave it a 1/10. Remarkable."
" This was a really good movie undeserving of the low ratings
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,9,"I passed on this movie because of the low ratings, the first time I saw it for rent. The descriptions of the movie made it seem horrible and depraved. Yes they implied things, but not anything like the reviews made it out to be! It was a great movie, very good performances and I'm glad I decided to rent it in the end. Don't miss out!"
" Dv
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,8,"At times, this movie was hard to stomach, however this movie depicts thereality of modern day life, but in a more dramatic fashion.I view this movie as a depiction of domestic violence, with the reverend depicting a pit-bull kind of abuser, the kind of abuser that wont let you go if you leave, that will hunt you and your children until full control is won.Great movie"
" How does this piece of crap rate more than 3 stars.
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,3,"May contain spoilers!This is one of worst ""westerns"" made in years. If you feel like watching women and children being abused in too many ways to count than you need some soul searching and maybe some therapy. I have liked all kinds of westerns over the years but this type of hate filled, violence for the sake of violence involving women and children,is a waste of time and some very good actors. I have liked most of Guy Pearce's work and I have been a fan of Dakota Fanning since ""I am Sam"". So I am always surprised when actors read a script like this and then make the movie. After reading some comments there seems to be an small audience for this type of movie. The same that like slasher movies I would think. The acting is still above par but the subject matter leaves a lot to be desired."
" Amazingly disappointing but still great
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,7,"The plot, acting and overall quality of this movie are fantastic. Visually stunning and absolutely compelling! The reverend is such an amazing antagonist and all other characters are top notch. However, I have to say this movie could have so easily been a knock out, yet it falls short due to several flaws, which only begin to present themselves after the mid way point (when you are so heavily invested in the film). The serious and seemingly genuine nature of the movie offers it very little forgiveness for when things don't seem quite right. I won't say what these things are. I don't intend to place any spoilers in my review. All I can say is, the devil is in the details and if they have paid a little more attention, some of the scenes would have been rewritten very differently. There are 3 distinct scenes of which if they had been executed differently, for me the movie would have been a solid 9-10. The film had me so mesmerized and when each of the 3 flawed scenes occurred they ripped me so far out of my trance out of disappointment. Therefore for me the movie is no more than a 7. It could have been great!"
" Great cast but terrible writing
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,1,"This was an uninteresting, boring movie with an unattractive story- line. Writing is not convincing, characters are not logical and plot is awkward. Way too long. There was a shameless cameo. Overall the cast was great as was the cinematography but the writing was terrible with implausible and illogical plot twists throughout. Let the whole movie down."
" Stellar Film, But Be Warned. A very Dark Tale
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,9,"Yet again I find myself questioning the right of the feeble minded to give a 1/10. The story alone warrants a higher score. The acting was amazing, yet the monkeys with guns vote 1/10.......Rant over and so to the film....... Told in 4 chapters it is an extremely dark, yet compelling tale of what appears a mystery cum horror but as the tale pans out it is actually a supremely told tale of an abusive husband/father. A sick example of how aligning oneself with religious beliefs gives the abuser carte blanche to carry out heinous acts upon others, especially those closest. Inconceivable? Just think of the catholic priests abusing children. I cannot stress enough that you need a strong constitution to watch some of the abuses carried out. Guy Pearce in his best role since Momentum is compelling in a role that you cannot turn away from, in fact like a car crash, you cannot avert your eyes to his evil deeds and Dakota Fanning clearly demonstrates her ability to transform from a child actor to female lead in her own right. I gave The Revenant 10/10 and genuinely I enjoyed this more so a 10/10 is a given. Even the child actors showed maturity beyond their years to make this a faultless, absorbing story. The ending, which I have no issue with, is a little Hollywood, with an effort to try and tie up loose ends. I pray for the day when Hollywood realises that not all films have to have a happy ending or a solution. Minor gripe, stellar film and acting."
" Great Story served with Shock value!
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,9,"It's a very dark and disturbing movie. I would liken it to The World of Kanako. The 4 non sequential plots unpack a great story. Makes you think about how hard and far women have come in this world, the objectification, men's entitlement, control over them...The list is quite long. Most people hating this movie are probably unhappy about religion being portrayed in a negative light, so if you are a zealot this movie is not for you. If not ignore reviews, watch the film and wince, pause take a break Through it... It won't be pleasant, but worth it."
" Worth watching. Great start, failing finale.
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,6,"Brimstone is an atypical Western about a young women (Fanning) who is confronted by her past, told in 4 chapters. From the start the movie grabs you: There is unease, tension, mystery. And sure, it is not always for the faint of heart. However in the last chapter, the movie crumbles. It just becomes too tiresome. The antagonist (Pearce) apparently is also some kind of superman and it all just becomes too silly, to a point that it becomes hard to still care for what's going on. Reflecting back, the plot also has some issues: Knowing what we know by the end, I wondered why she was so passive in her actions at the start of the movie.Acting overall was great though. Dakota Fanning was wonderful. Guy Pearce's Dutch-ified English was fun too hear too. 6.5/10"
" The less you know, the more this movie will catch you unawares
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,7,"While Brimstone would register to most, as a Western (and for the most part it is), the horror elements cannot be denied. The gruesome kills and vicious shark-like nature of this movies protagonist, played terrifyingly well, by Guy Pearce, will keep you glued to your screen, even with the long run time of 2hrs plus. Dakota Fanning is at the top of her game here, in a role that requires her to show, not tell. She and Guy Pearce are the main reasons why Brimstone is as good as it is, while young actress, Emilia Jones, also delivers. It's a slow burn, so for those with a lack of patience, this movie might seem tedious, but for myself , the performances, the unexpected brutality and the strength and tenaciousness of our heroine Liz, makes Brimstone a must see. If you enjoyed, Bone Tomahawk, you'll find a lot to like about Brimstone."
" Feminist horror fantasy masked in realism
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,6,"6/10 This film has the trappings a good film - excellent cinematography, acting and score. However, the film frustrates the viewer early on by venturing from its promising beginning as a drama headlong into horror, and sacrificing its well earned realism by portraying the preacher as an overpowered super villain, rather than a believable antagonist rooted in the world of the main character. The film has been hailed by some as victorious or feminist. Unfortunately, the film does itself a disservice by become a sermon, but one without any message of redemption. Many have rightly pointed out, that the male characters are all incredibly evil or, in case of the few exceptions, completely ineffectual. Similarly, most of the female characters are either passive or victimized continuously without ever being able to fully escape or defeat their oppressors until the very end of the film. The film is riddled with plot holes that are frustrating to the viewer that wants the protagonist not to suffer needlessly (after 2.5 hours of it you start to become desensitized), but seem to be designed to further the directors purpose of: 1. casting men and puritanical Christians as evil 2. Sabotage any the female characters' ability to avoid harm so that they can be further victimized by the puritanical and evil men. For instance, why does Liz not tell her husband that the preacher is clearly the one terrorizing them, let alone expose his past of torture and rape? It's as if this is not even considered an option, and yet all the while the only two good men in the story (the husband and the son) die without ever being able to call for help from the other townsfolk, who know them much better than they know the preacher. Other plot holes jump in my mind - how did the preacher survive having his throat slit and being unconscious after blood loss, seconds from burning alive in a house where the only other man had just been murdered and would therefore be unable to assist carrying him out alive? Why did the wife kill herself, when she knew that the husband wanted to rape her daughter, who would be more vulnerable without her protection? Was that bravery? Why did Liz kill herself, when she could have simply gotten anybody that knew her from her childhood or from her time at the whorehouse - think how many people she worked with or even serviced intimately that could have identified her? She gave up, despite having fought tooth and nail to save herself and her daughter, and now, being presumably wealthy enough to pay for a lawyer. I believe its not uncommon for a bounty to require the return of a suspected criminal to the county in question before having a trial, where the townsfolk would recognize her as someone they knew for years and not the perpetrator. Was it really necessary for her to cut out her tongue? It's not like the husband specifically preferred a silent spouse. After meeting the pretty young, not deformed former prostitute, I think it goes without saying that he's not so picky that he would refuse her, given that the other fiancé was now dead. Instead we get plot service that ultimately is designed to sabotage Liz's happiness once again at the very end of the movie. It's not men torturing the women in the movie, its just one man: the director. And meanwhile you can tell he's flagellating himself over his own cultural guilt, just like the reverend did after terrorizing his wife to the point of suicide. Last plot hole that comes to mind: How did the Reverend sneak into the house without Liz knowing at the end of the film, and silently murder the Grandpa who presumably was standing by the daughter's bed without making a sound, and without any clear access into the house? Why was there a pistol in the basement when the Grandpa was unarmed? Why did he say that he should be holding 'the gun' when he had at least one pistol. Frankly, she brought her own rifle, so realistically he would have a rifle as well, given that it was customary and he had rifle shells in the house. Again, plot holes designed to sabotage the well being of the main character in this sadistic film. This film amounted to a horror fantasy intending to convey the most negative possible warning of religious dogma - of Christianity, specifically - and of the dreaded patriarchy. I think to some it will seem victorious because they believe that these are the most toxic elements of the West. I think the film is a few beats too late, is not shocking in its message whatsoever, because it is walking down a well tread path. I feel like this film was made partly in reaction to the Christian fundamentalist mass shooting in Norway that killed 77 people. I'm personally happy to explore themes of toxic fundamentalism, Christian or otherwise, but when the message overpowers the film, it becomes problematic. The interpretation of Christianity and the role of women in society at the time seem to be as warped and unrealistic as the arguably superhuman reverend. In his ultimate death scene, he does not even flinch when his entire body is engulfed in flame for several seconds, before being blasted sensationally out the window. This is a not a realistic portrayal of a preacher, a bad guy, or what would have happened if the events of this movie unfolded in real life. A plot that stuck to reality, would have been superior and actually worth something. This movie in it's totality, I would say is ultimately worthless."
" A Wow !
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,10,"A hundred and twenty eight minutes of a complete turn around of what you've known in a typical movie you'll love and hate at certain points a movie with maybe history but with depth and understanding of cultures and yes religions I'm not a professional movie critic so I have to some how write five lines, I did and found this movie that I avoided a must watch!"
" Horrid to watch, unless you hate women.
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,1,"After watching this movie, I can only conclude that whomever created and green lit this movie hates women. I know some will disagree, but it was terribly brutal, hard to watch, and I literally had to watch something lighthearted as a mental cleanse after watching it.And last, for anyone to say that the main character is not a ""victim"" ignores the fact that she was repeatedly raped and sold throughout the movie. She was strong, but the sadistic underpinnings of this movie need to be called exactly what they are."
" Wow!! Really an excellent movie!
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,"Reviewing movies and or reading reviews is subjective to say the least. So many reviews rave on and yet the movie is a huge disappointment. That said, this movie is so good I'm simply baffled why there wasn't a push by the studio to promote this and give it a fighting chance at the box office. I guess that makes this movie a ""sleeper"" but it's an exceptional sleeper worth your time and money.If you want details about the story line, check other reviews, my only goal with this review is to get you to watch this. I'm not a professional reviewer or have any financial interest in this movie, I'm just an ""average Joe"" movie watcher with an opinion. In my opinion, this is an excellent movie and should be watched.The story is terrific and unique, the acting is simply OUTSTANDING, the way the entire story was told is creative and unique. Note-this is a violent movie, at times disturbing violence, so if that offends you then this movie is not for you. For everyone else, watch this winner!!"
" Good, but Brutal, Disturbing and Shocking
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,7,"The story opens when the new Preacher (Guy Pierce) starts off the prayer service and Liz (Dakota Fanning) sees him she is scared for her life. It's quite obvious that she knows who he is. The Preacher admits he is out to take everything away from her. This is basically her story. I don't think I have ever seen such a brutal, disturbing and shocking Western as this one. The Story is told in 4-chapters: Chapter 1: In the present, Lis is a mute and a mail-order bride to a man with a son. She had a girl Sam (Ivy George) with this man and she uses Sam via sign language to verbalize what she wants to say to others.Chapter 2: We see her past life as a prostitute.Chapter 3: We see her first family life and here her name is Joanna played by Emilia Jones, who does an Oscar-worthy job. Chapter 4: Is Retribution. Having seen all that went before, we cannot wait for this one. I don't think I have ever seen Dakoa Fanning do a better job than what she does in here. Kudos. Oscar-worthy? Yes. In a word, this is hard to watch, at times, because of some of the brutal, disturbing, bloody and shocking scenes that are pertinent to the story and even I had to avert my eyes several times. Tension and suspense are always close by. Despite my feelings regarding the subject matter, the acting by all was excellent and it is a good script and we do see some excellent cinematography. I just hope that future Westerns do not copy the total reality of what we see in this one. We can only hope. The ending surprised me somewhat. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, and quite graphic too. Nudity: Yes, full frontal. Language: Yes."
" Powerful filmmaking at it's best!
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,10,"'BRIMSTONE': Five Stars (Out of Five)A western thriller about a girl that must protect her family from a sinister new reverend, and the past they share that brought on this horrible conflict. It was written and directed by Martin Koolhoven. The cast features Dakota Fanning, Guy Pearce, Emilia Jones and Kit Harington. The film got really positive reviews from critics in Europe, and at festivals, but it's also oddly gotten mostly negative reviews from critics in America. I agree with the European critics and the festivals.Liz (Fanning) is a mute housewife that's trying to fit in to a small town. When a new reverend (Pearce) arrives there, she knows she can't trust him and she fears that her family is in great danger. The reverend also appears to have great mistrust for Liz, and he seems to hold some kind of a sinister grudge against her. We later learn, through three more chapters, why the two have such a horrifyingly unhealthy relationship with each other.The movie is powerful filmmaking at it's best. It's also as disturbing as hell though, and it made me feel completely depressed (and kind of awful) while I was watching it (and after). It's so well made, and acted though (Pearce is amazing in it). There are so many totally involving and nightmarish scenes in it too, that will haunt me forever probably. I have to respect a film like that. It's 2 hours and 30 minutes long also, and it's never dull or a chore to sit through. I think it's an epic masterpiece, and a film I'll never forget; despite how negative it might make me feel, about life and the world in general. It's also a great female empowerment tale too though. The world is a screwed up place at times (often). It's also a very beautiful place too, but we need movies (and all types of art) that masterfully illustrate both. This is one of those dark art masterpieces, that deserves to be respected I think.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/217879519"
" Wretched
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,1,Horrible. Confusing. Emotional waste by-product. Confusing.Did I mention confusing?? You need a scorecard to keep track of the characters and implausible twists.The good scenes could be wound up in a 2 minute hi- light reel. Lugubrious and turgid. An expensive turd of a talkie.
" Terrible
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,1,The movie was unpleasant all the way through. Repeatedly showed grose and nasty images that added nothing to the story. My wife and I ended up just shutting it off and not continuing. Do yourself a favor and just skip it. There are plenty of other movies that don't have to rely on being nasty to tell a good tale.
" What a miserable experience
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,1,"If you want a movie that stars out with a dreadful situation and just continues on until after all the torture you are left with a crappy ending then this is the movie for you. I feel like I wasted my time knowing about a third of the way through this movie it was going to have a unhappy ending and leave you feeling shitty but I was hopeful. I was wrong, felt shitty through out the entire movie."
" A Study of Degradation
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,2,"Unnecessarily violent and perverted. This is a study in degradation, pure and simple. Don't be fooled by those who claim this is an uplifting story of a brave woman. If that were true, it could have been done with far more subtlety and accomplished the same end. I have no idea what producers think the movie-going public want, but if they want this, as a society, we have fallen to a level that we would be wise not to reveal. This is a movie without any redeeming values. True, they try to make it so with a begging-for-forgiveness ending and heroic music, but I didn't buy it and you shouldn't either. The actors should apologize for participating in this travesty. Don't waste your time or your integrity."
" Enjoyable don't listen to the bad reviews
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,I was a bit dubious at how this film would be but I thought it was fantastic. I loved the chapter ideas and the acting was great. It's been a long time since I've enjoyed watching a film as good as this. It has gotten quite a few bad reviews but each to their own. It does get a little gory but the ending was unexpected which is good to find in a film as so many these days are predictable.
" Unsettling mood but overly long.
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,5,"Brimstone has that unsettling tone for a western thriller but fails on managing to have a well set pace. It has a talented cast, and Guy Pearce played a Reverend well with dark behaviors. The film follows Liz (Dakota Fanning), a mute, and she aids in delivering babies in her small town. Until, a Reverend (Guy Pearce) shows up, preaching and punishing those that don't follow his beliefs. Liz and her family are tormented and stalked by the Reverend, which she knows a secret history that is slowly catching up to her. Brimstone does have a well-set cast; I mean Guy Pearce was creepy and haunting with his performance. Even, Dakota Fanning did okay, and Carice van Houten and Kit Harington brief moments were okay too. The script written by Martin Koolhoven felt so flat with the characters. Even with the plot breaking into four chapters and not following in a chronological order just to add a bit of history with these characters did not help the movie at all. The movie did have potential in being good, with a tone and direction that feels like it was in Salem and people were accused of witchcraft type of era. But the development with the characters was non-existent. For two and half hour running time, the characters were still forgettable. I also thought the film was slow and dull after the first hour. For being two and half hours, it really dragged on for a while. The tone was unsettling and had some moments which was hard to watch. Especially, with the Reverends acts and punishing Liz, Anna (Carice van Houten), and her young daughter. Those moments were disturbing and creepy as it goes over youth and sexuality. The direction tried to set a good western thriller but left behind with a boring script and an overlong movie."
" Worse than bad
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,1,"What a load of tripe. There is a higher chance in getting me to believe in Demons from Outer Space than the story-line in this abomination. Beyond finger down the throat vomit--grotesque and disgusting for effect without moral or meaning. Time sequences that are a physical impossibility, such as the nemesis getting ahead on foot to that of a horse drawn carriage within the same night (maybe 7 hours) to kill a Ram, have the ram cool off enough to be covered with snow, then put in the path of the (now behind him) carriage as to cause the carriage with the protagonist to run over it and falter--and that same person sitting in a snow and fog treeline with (out of nowhere) a scoped long rifle and kill a target completely obscured by dense fog. Just completely and brazenly stupid and unbelievable. The constant infliction of pain and suffering on countless people in this flick who cold easily have escaped same, or ended their repression. JUNK, sensationalized junk, better watching reruns of the Flintstones, it would be historically more correct than this steaming pile of movie mush. And the ending? For what, another never would happen event. I really want my 2 hours back."
" Dutch gem
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,8,"How do you review this flick. Not that easy because some say it's a western but for me it's a lot more. The performances are sublime, the story is excellent, the cinematography is top. By now you got it, this is a Dutch gem. Even as it clocks in over 2 hours it never bored me and there's a lot of talking going on. Don't watch it for classic Western style. Just watch it for it's critic on religion, on how women were treated.I can't really go into the story itself because I would spoil a lot, just go watch it sit and see what a perfect flick is all about. Be aware that some scene's can offend some viewers.Gore 1/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 3/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5"
" stupid film no one should have made
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,1,"what's the point of making such rubbish? if it was titled as a horror flic - i could understand, people who are into horror movies would go and watch it. So, why create such a useless film? to disgust us? to show us to what level of stupidity the writer can get? You learn nothing from this rubbish, you dirty your soul with idiotism beyond belief, Martin Koolhoven managed to show us that HE is as sick as can be. The whole film you will just sit and wonder why it was made, and who was stupid enough to write this puke."
" Horror Thriller & Drama..but thriller mainly
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,9,"This is deep and intense movie. A story of women who gone through a very tough life. The movie is full of thriller and horror. The plot is kind of 18 century. The story is really good and hold its audiences pretty well. They have shown such a thing which is highly inappropriate even for fully grown person. Like incest, beating a kid brutally, covering a women's face with some metal thing so that she cannot talk. The movie contains moment when things happen out of nowhere and many ""damn!"" moments and you will end up asking ""why? why am I seeing this brutal movie"" and the answer is you want to know what happens next, Did that psychopath guy died. And if you are a feminist then this movie will boil your blood. This movie is brutal ,contains nudity & curse language and only meant for adult audiences and should not be seen with friend or family or anyone.This is really good movie because of thriller."
" Amazing movie!
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,9,"Such an intense, deep and emotional movie! When a movie activates your emotions, it is because it is a good one. It doesn't really matter if it is sad or happy, the important thing is that for a couple of hours, your mind is completely immersed in the story, because in the end, that is the reason why we watch movies, to get entertained and distracted from our routines.And that is exactly what happens with this movie. Even though it is quite long (almost three hours long), I was never worried about how much time was left. The story of the main character (Liz), is so intense, that I could not take my eyes off the screen. I am a big fan of flashbacks, and in this movie this technic is wisely used. It starts showing how Liz is uncomfortable and frightened by the new reverend's presence in town, which gets your attention and makes you want to know what the hell happen between those two. That is when the movie starts going backwards and showing us what happened to Liz before arriving to that town, but always leaving the original issue with the reverend behind. Therefore, the viewer is expectant the whole movie, awaiting to know what caused the conflict between them.Moreover, the western landscapes are beautifully shot, transmitting the cold and isolation of those towns.In conclusion, Brimstone is an absolutely masterpiece, which definitely should have been part of the Oscars nominees!"
" Reverend Trump
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"Positives: 1. Sets, locations, props, costumes all authentically spot on. A rarity when period productions come from the US, but this is European based and follows other US Westerns created in Europe that surpass what we do. 2. Storyline was authentic from the perspective of showing the worst of US western mining town life. 3. Acting did it's job, perhaps too well as it was obviously discomforting to a contemporary sterile plastic mass produced society clientele. Negatives: 1. Too much raw lifestyle for the sedated crowd. 2. Doesn't portray institutionalized religion in a highly supportive fashion; disconcerting to many. Interesting side note: Part way through I was struck by the following: How much the Reverend's behavior reminded me of Trump. Besides the obvious finger wagging, non-sensical verbiage, and shouting was the misusing of the Bible, and, of course, females - all for personal gain. On the other hand the film also showed how some women allow them selves to be submissive, and accept - even justify - male dominance of their lives, resulting in violence towards them; which the movie more than made clear."
" Dark but good
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"It's been a long time since I didn't watched a good western like this one. Not the typical cowboys versus Indians western but more a thriller drama from that period. I think it shows good how badly women were treated in that time. Not that everybody was like that but I can perfectly well imagine that the opinion of women didn't really matter in those hard days. The story is well written, with the right amount of suspense, but is sometimes hard to watch. Some scenes are very degrading for women. Guy Pearce does a perfect job playing The Reverend. He's a disgusting character and you wish the worst happens to him, but that's also due to the good acting skills from Guy Pearce. Dakota Fanning did also a perfect job as well as the young Emilia Jones both playing the young and older Liz/Joanna. The soundtrack adds something special to the already dark ambiance of the movie. The surroundings and nature shots are perfect for the movie. Even though it's not shot anywhere near the movie is supposed to be it certainly looks like that."
" False Advertising in IMDb & Most of Users
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,3,"NB: THE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW ARE OF MINOR IMPORTANCE.As my headline says, I feel I was frauded into seeing this movie by its plot summary on this site and some user reviews glorifying it.The plot summary goes: ""A triumphant epic of survival and a tale of powerful womanhood and resistance against the unforgiving cruelty of a hell on earth. Our heroine is Liz (Dakota Fanning), carved from the beautiful wilderness, full of heart and grit, hunted by a vengeful Preacher (Guy Pearce) - a diabolical zealot and her twisted nemesis. But Liz is a genuine survivor; she's no victim - a woman of fearsome strength who responds with astonishing bravery to claim the better life she and her daughter deserve..."" User reviews go: ""Terrific"", ""Best movie of LFF this year"",""Dark, violent and depressing - wonderful"", ""Super powerful"", ""Simply amazing"", ""Original"" etc.I say this much is true that it is violent, dark and utterly depressing. All the characteristics I do not tend to have problem with - I love dark dramas and gory horror films. What I have a problem with is the lack of everything else. THERE IS NO TRIUMPH IN THIS STORY. IT DOES NOT EMPOWER WOMEN OR DEPICT THEM AS STRONG SURVIVORS. OUR MAIN CHARACTER (AS EVERY OTHER WOMAN THERE) IS A VICTIM. She continues to be a victim throughout all the bloody movie. She is no fighter but victim and escaper who lets everyone else die fighting for her or just because knowing her. This is two and a half hours long torture porn and eventual death of a villain in a completely unsatisfying manner does not make it triumphant.Showing the life of wild west from women's non-enviable pov was an admirable effort, but the overly powerful (semi-immortal???) villain, story that didn't know did it want to be harsh reality tale or dark mystic thriller, lack of power in every female character etc pulled it down into just some depressing tale that goes on and on and on and on and then suddenly ends without pulling the ends together.I suspect that it ticked the right boxes to get high votes: European writer/director, overall depressing feel, a story that is messy and full of holes so film hipsters can call it ""thought-provoking""... Yup, for aforementioned wannabes it is probably a good tone to praise the movie :P Cinematography was great. Also acting."
" A brutal and harrowing Western
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,8,"Brutal. Harrowing. Unforgiving. Just a few words that come to mind that succinctly describe the experience of watching BRIMSTONE. If you like/don't mind the unsavory and uncompromising in your entertainment you'll probably enjoy this. If you like languidly paced art films, then you'll probably enjoy this. Otherwise, you might lose your patience. The narrative unfolds slowly and methodically, but the payoff is mostly worth the time taken to get there. Aiming to keep this spoiler-free, a brief synopsis is that a new minister (Guy Pearce) comes to a small Western town, and this puts a mute woman (Dakota Fanning) on edge, especially after a miscarriage puts her at odds with her fellow townsfolk. One further important detail is that the film is divided into four chapters, and the first three of these unfold in reverse chronological order. The movie centers around Dakota Fanning and Guy Pearce's characters, and the narrative structure allowed the director to withhold key information until the right time. Of course, like many other films with unique narrative devices, remove it and the film wouldn't be nearly as effective. That being said, there's plenty of stuff that goes on in nearly two and a half hours. A little indulgent? Sure, but all of the narrative elements are good enough to not make this much of a deal-breaker. I will say that the pacing, though slow, was steady and I never got bored. Thematically, Martin Koolhoven (the director) was able to use the period setting effectively to portray a world of religious coercion and the lengths men will go to justify oppressing women. Guy Pearce's character was basically evil incarnate, and it was a scarily brilliant performance. Dakota Fanning also did well, certainly better than I've seen out of her before. Kit Harrington also had a small role as a man that Dakota Fanning's character secretly nurses back to health, and who also teaches her a valuable lesson. From the more technical side, I greatly enjoyed the beautiful cinematography, and the haunting score by Tom Holkenborg (aka, JunkieXL). All things considered, this is one of the best films I've seen in a while, Western or not. For some reason, Europeans seem to do a better job nowadays tackling this genre, and BRIMSTONE is no exception. As long as you're a somewhat patient viewer, and not easily offended, I can highly recommend this."
" A film that packs a punch.....and then some. If you can stomach it you'll love it.
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,9,"My advice is don't watch this before bed because you probably won't sleep, but if you do sleep, expect nightmares! You think I'm joking, I'm not!! After saying that you'd expect a bad review but to be honest I thought this was a great film with a fantastic story, it's just very hard to watch.What can I tell you other than you won't find it an enjoyable experience because it's deeply unsettling, disturbing, brutal and savage, but it's still an extraordinarily gripping film and Dakota Fanning especially is mesmerising.I didn't watch a trailer before embarking on this journey into hell but I had read a couple of reviews but it still didn't prepare me for what was to come, so be warned! Saying that don't think there is gore and brutality thrown about simply as a shock factor. It's all very relative to the story, and one very twisted character which makes it so immersive and powerful.An excellently made film and a gripping tale expertly told, incredibly acted out by a great cast."
" Misunderstood
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,8,"I found this movie very hard to watch, not the gore but the deep gut wrenching emotion of what the women of all ages were put through. I could only recommend to any family members with a warning because of the content. I feel a lot of the reviewers have just not 'got' what the director was trying to get across. Deep, deep movie....well done."
" Quite violent
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,5,"Great story, but unfortunately there is a ""however."" The order in which the events were presented made it difficult for me to follow. Maybe it's me, but having seen other movies that went back and forth between decades with out much trouble, it was annoying. I was also a bit put off by the violence, graphic and implied. It may be for some but not for me. I simply don't want to be exhausted trying to watch a movie."
" Utter Garbage from Absolute Morons
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,1,"This is what you get: Two different women have their tongues cut out. Charming! One woman is gut-stabbed. Sweet! One woman is horse-whipped for objecting to her husband's plan to rape his/her daughter. Inspirational! After that, he has a blacksmith put an iron mask on her face, then hauls her into church where -- get this -- nobody says a word about the iron mask. Wow! Need I go on?"
" If people are really that stoopid, this is a great story
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,3,"A story woven into unnecessary segments in order to complicate what is a very simple one of revenge where a bad person who is unstoppable until the very end, because like all god squad, he quotes scripture to pump up his own importance and frighten those who can't think straight... and his prey, a perpetual victim who even victimises herself by cutting her own tongue out... which for some unforeseen reason means she can't tell those around her what's going on in sign language and they in turn are unable to ask. A frustrating mess of a story which is acted astonishingly well by all concerned. The story is very much in the vein of a horror where everyone does really stoopid things otherwise the plot doesn't go very far... which of course means the tension doesn't build as you're always thinking ""that just wouldn't happen cos people aren't that consistently dumb""... then again maybe I'm too generous."
" Not worth the time
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,1,"This is only the 2nd movie I have had to stop watching in 50yrs! By the end of the movie, you cannot wait to kill the preacher yourself!! I am sure that this sort of thing still happens today, but having to watch it makes me mad! It's 2.5hrs I will not soon forget!I should have chosen a better movie to watch!"
" The intense religious aspects are sadistic and the interaction between Liz and the Reverend are enough to give you chills
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,7,"""Many people believe that God does not approve of violence. They have not read their Bible."" Liz (Fanning) is a happy wife and mother living in a sleepy little town. Things begin to change when a new reverend (Pearce) shows up. Liz senses danger but no one is believing her and when something terrible happens Liz is left trying to clear her name, and forget her past. This is a movie that is just flat out disturbing. Fanning does a really fantastic job of acting in this but Pearce just steals the movie. His character is so terrifying, without being over the top. The scariest part is that there are actually people like him today. This is a movie that is hard to watch. The intense religious aspects are sometimes sadistic and the interaction between Liz and the Reverend are enough to give you chills watching this. This is a good movie and worth seeing, but because of the content and the feel it is one that is really hard to recommend. I give this a B."
" An intelligent well executed movie for a mature audience.
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,10,"Finally a 2 and a half hour movie that kept me awake from beginning to end. Not because it was bursting with over done explosions and action but because the story and acting is so compelling that you just have to keep watching to find out how it all ends. Fair warning some may feel a little confused about what is happening at first because the story actually starts at the end and then moves through different times in the life of the central character but that is fine because the story is broken into chapters so you quickly realize that we are moving to a new time line. This is not something to watch with the kids or on your first movie night with the new love of your life there are more than enough of those around. No this is something different to be enjoyed alone or with someone you have been with for a while and wants to see something not aimed at kids but at a mature audience with the intellect to understand it for what it is. It is engrossing, intelligent, disturbing, moving, exiting and a great way to pass some time."
" Dark and Depressive
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,5,"This movie isn't for the faint-hearted - it's very dark and verges on the edge of being distasteful. There is no light and shade to it and that is why I only gave it a five. I think there could have been brighter moments in amongst the gloom. It's oppressive, depressing and on the edge the whole way through. Guy Pearce is excellent as the murderous preacher, but his character does go within a hair's breadth of being a little too perverse. The slightly odd way of showing events in different, later-merging segments, works quite well, but may annoy and confuse some viewers. It's hard to sum up, without giving away too much, but it centers around a young woman, pursued relentlessly by a uber-puritanical preacher, who takes religion to a whole new level. Some of the scenes may upset; there is violence aplenty: sexual abuse; paedophilia; incest; spousal-abuse; self-flagellation; rape, voyeurism and sadism and that can be a little wearing, as the oppressive feeling never really lets up. It's not clear at first, as to why the preacher has a bee in his bonnet with the young woman, but that becomes clearer as the movie progresses. The ending left me a little dissatisfied - it could have lifted the mood, but only deepened the depressive tone. It's not a 'feel good' movie, by any stretch of the imagination and when the titles started to roll, I found my self exhaling and saying wow! but not in a particularly positive way. I'd never watch the movie again, simply because it is so depressive. That said, it is powerful and a real assault on the senses, but it's not going to be for everyone."
" awful , don't watch
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst movies I ever seen , such a waste of time , the movie is about a pervert father who keep chasing his own daughter to have sex with her , enough said , I don't know how this movie got a rating of 7.1 !?a bunch of main events in the movie happened in a silly scenario that doesn't respect human mind , and the ending is so ridiculous and doesn't make sense at all , after all this fighting to protect her child and survive she simply suicide !? if I regret anything in this world it would be watching this movie ."
" No sense
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,2,"It starts really well and keep your attention to the story. Actors did a good job. But in the end there's no story. whats the point in making all that drama and does not link everything whit a good ending? Bad crap end!this story had so much potential, but its all it got. I just don't get it how people can rate this a 7 movie."
" A perfect Waste of Time
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,1,"This is one of the dumbest movies about a father wanting to marry his daughter because his wife will not carry out her wifely duties. The premise is stupid, the epic sweeping of the tale told in chapters is also insulting to the viewer. Not sure what the director was so entranced with the script/story about. Guy Pearce played a reverend who must have been special ops in Sweden and was perfect for pursuing his poor daughter. The ironic tale is plain dumb and tries to pass itself off as artistic but miserably fails. The resolution made me regret watching this stupid tepid movie. I can see the point the movie was trying to make about the absence of women's rights back in the day but it was more of a showboating technique with no real depth. If the mute woman knew of the treachery of her father then why would she attend a church he was the pastor of with her family. Why would she not tell her husband about the stuff this dude did before? This movie questions the intelligence of the viewer and tries to sensationalize the absurd!"
" Agonizingly Intense and Dramatic
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,9,"Contrary to some other reviews that complain about its length and over the top graphic violence, this is a move that could not be less than the time it takes. This is an epic experience and one that requires a full immersion. The acting of the leads is first rate. It never come across as staged intensity or false. The filming is so vivid and the coloring intoxicating, the sound score painfully delicious. Every scene is gorgeous and powerful. There may be points where a degree of disbelief must be suspended, but this movie is part horror, a statement about the danger of extremism and religious power as well as the treatment of women. The power of the priest does seem surreal and beyond human so the few moments of feats of extraordinary ability are within the range of the narrative of the film. This movie is probably best watched in stages, to allow each portion to be appreciated and to being overwhelmed by it. One of the best experiences I have watched so far."
" Blood Lust and not much else redeeming
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,1,"If you are into BLOOD LUST just for the sake of it then this movie is just for you. First it doesn't even follow the time line of the young lady in the story, then it's just GORE for the sake of GORE. Might as well call this a movie for the Satanic Liberals and leave it at that, what a WASTE of time."
" The hype is better than the film
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,5,"I really wanted to like this film, and watched it because some of my favorite actors were in it. As far as the acting is concerned, everyone's performance was stellar. It's too bad that the actors didn't have a better story and plot to work with. The cinematography was really great but, the director needs to stick to film-making and let someone else do the writing. There were way too many reality discrepancies in the plot, and it was long and drawn out unnecessarily. There was also way too much gratuitous violence. As someone who has seen all the good western movies ever made, in my opinion this is not even a true western movie. In the true old west 150 plus years ago, the villain would have never lived long enough to continue on his sick rampage. The congregation would have seen him for what he was, and put him out of his misery. The ultra religious of the time were not stupid enough to follow the villain in the story past his obvious signs of blasphemy and lunacy. The women in the film are not depicted as strong, they are depicted as weak and helpless. That is quite the opposite of the description of the film. There are other reality discrepancies besides what I've mentioned, but I won't list them here for the sake of brevity.I rated the film 5 stars for the great acting and cinematography, but I was really frustrated and disappointed with the plot and writing. Sadly, I would not recommend the film to most of the people I know."
" True life
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,9,"Yes, also I was horrified at times (hence the 9) as we are horrified of some events in real life today. We have to admit that the time of the movie's setting was lawless. Like most new world discoveries. You had to be extremely tough to survive. It is my opinion Koolhoven has succeeded showing us simply that extreme way of survival including all its religious hocus pocus."
" Another cr*p writer/director movie - jeez!
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,1,"Not so much any plot giveaways, just peppered with warnings.Yes, this was always likely to split opinion.First observation - it's a bit late to the party but it's another of those irritating, annoying, purposeless, uninventive, attempts-at-suspense movies that is not told in a linear fashion. Even Tarantino f*cks up this conceit.Why, why oh why juxtapose the order of events? Arty? Add mystery? Suspense? A new form of storytelling? Because 'I wrote the damn movie and I can'? Yeah, that's about it. Do you think he wrote the movie in a linear fashion and then split it up or did he write the first bit and wondered where the hell to go from there? Frankly I don't give a damn.If you can't tell a story forwards, it's not going to be any better if you tell it backwards. Or is that too difficult an idea to process?Second observation - writer/director. It's over-long and self-indulgent. I keep making the point that not all writer/director movies are bad but I must qualify that now by saying just 99.9% of them! Can't fault the actors - just the script. I can only imagine the cast needed the money.OK, maybe it's not 'that bad'. Let's try drawn-out, needlessly-confusing, over-inflated, trying (far, far) too hard and, again, self-indulgent - let's indulge this writer/director's whims and fancies. Indulge, indulge, indulge.It's storytelling, Jim, but not as we know it. Or want to know it. Unless you're an art-faced, pretentious sycophant.So you may get the impression that I didn't like it. If some goddamn person had held Koolhoven to account then it might have been a decent movie. Bleak, dismal, uninspiring and, yes, overly, overly long but decent.I just wish I'd read this review before watching it and saved two-and-a-half hours of my movie-watching life! You have been warned."
" Boring.
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,3,"Bad movie. It felt like it was five hours long. Exhausting, and tedious. It's one of the most boring, (and again) WAY TOO LONG movie i've seen in years. Don't see the point in filming in non chronological order either. A complete mess."
" Easily the single best film of 2016
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,10,"This film is absolutely amazing on so many levels. And i totally agree with those who said that BrimStone is the best film of 2016. It accomplishes that with ease even.And lets say for a moment even if this film would not nonchalantly offend alt-right and religiously delusional hypocrites a like, purely from a cinematic standpoint BrimStone is a stunning piece of work.I found that the characters, the story, the dialogue, the camera and lighting was so well crafted that the the sum of it all quickly pulled me in. BrimStone has that mesmerizing quality that lets you forget everything else around you while watching. The main villain was the most detestable character in a very long time. No spoilers here, but wow... The classical music is absolutely beautiful and fits the theme, emotions and story extremely well. Somewhere i read that this film was 5 years in the making. And it shows every well crafted moment.We watch films for emotional connections. And this film does connect so masterfully. And if you are unable to accomplish such, or find it hard to follow a simple story, there are still plenty of explosions and leather clad superheroes to brighten your day in other recent productions. Don't watch the trailer. Ignore the insecure alt-right internet crap storm. And jump straight into this film without any spoilers. That way BrimStone is the most enjoyable experience. BrimStone is a classic,essential drama, in every sense of the word. Don't miss it!"
" Potential Thriller - Split too Thin
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,4,"This movie was indeed meant to be a good movie - at least based on the story it wanted to pitch. At the beginning, it did create a suspense & tried to carry it through different chapters. But this attempt is where all ended. All the good acting goes in vain and the reverend character - being religiously blind & pedophile in nature makes things too disturbing to absorb.And that makes me think, who is the target audience for this movie? You definitely can't consider this to be a family movie. Is this really a mystery thriller? It showed glimpses of thrill but that got diluted with too much separation between chapters. Also too much focus on the gory details of torture & violence take the focus away at times. Additionally, the character of reverend - who was painted as a meticulous person, showed erratic behaviors in his steps - which don't add up.To summarize, I started watching this movie & gradually got en-thrilled by the mystery that was building up gradually. But then lost the link due to the intentional gaps created int the plot. I somehow managed to get past this. Actors did a great job - no denying! Dakota Fanning did great even with limited speech. Guy Pearce - did justice to his character (though the plot gave him undue advantage on multiple instances). But I wish the story-line & director was a bit more caring on the finesse to carry forward the thrill, than splitting it in too many pieces."
" so many deaths i stopped caring
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,6,"It was an amazing film, with great characters, thrilling, gripping, interesting plot layout etc, etc.But i just kind of feel like its a bit overkill with killing all the characters. And i don't really mind, like i love game of thrones i thought the character killing was original. I just feel like it made me loose emotional connection with the story because near the end when it got really bad i was just like ""oh who gives a duck about this film"" and couldn't even be bothered to listen to the closing scene. Would still recommend watching it, but i think it would have been 100% better if a couple of characters weren't killed, and the protagonist had a couple more positive life experiences or moments."
" Good movie, poor ending.
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,6,"That was a good movie, I kinda loved it. It's about a girl escaping his evil ""father"". But some points really ridiculous to me. I can say that, director did a really good job there, with directing this movie but I can't say same thing for his story (scenario). And I didn't like this movie's ending. I think he ruined a good movie with last ten minutes."
" I hoped for so much more...
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,6,"As a Dutch citizen, I was really stoked for this movie. The interview I've read with Dutch director Martin Koolhoven, who worked for years on this script and getting this movie made, was so promising. Now, as my fellow Dutchies now, our country's output in movies is still pretty worthless. I do really admire Koolhoven for pulling of a big project as this, I don't think there are a lot of Dutch directors who would be able to handle a movie on this scale(apart from Verhoeven, Kuijpers and Jan Kounen).Brimstone definitely has it's moments, with beautiful cinematography and strong acting. I do like that the story is told in reverse chronological order. The main thing I didn't like was the father, he was a too flat character. What could've been a layered, torn, religion obsessed man ended up in being a monster straight out of a slasher kind of Horror flick, who's only desire was to r*pe his posterity. Almost laughable. At points the characters have to over explain their intentions, using bible quotes (to really prove to the audience that the bible can be a base for this sickness? we get that okay...) Another moment I felt was really over explaining was how the daughter had to ask her mother how she could live under this circumstances. I mean, the mother was muzzled, I think just a simple disapproving look would've been enough. This lack of subtlety also displays when mother commits suicide in the full church, and preacher daddy immediately starts screaming ""this is a abomination and blabla"". I think the father would've been shocked for a bit, not that his wife was dead (he was a clear psychopath) but that she didn't apply to his rules. He doesn't have to shout all his underlying motives to get this plot point clear to the audience. Come to think of it, I'm happy there weren't 3 voice overs explaining the character's inner thoughts for the three viewers that could've missed it. I really feel that the story could've been build up more fluid, dragging you more in the darkness step by step (like the movie Dogville, for instance). Last thing that I didn't like were some of the sex scenes. I get the purpose, but some of it felt so ""Dutch"". As in bad. Like the scene for Frank's shooting duel, I get that the world of a brothel is special/different/interesting and you want to show that, but to me it came across as a bad Tiroler sex film bit. Still though, after all I said, I'd definitely watch a new Koolhoven movie because he there were enough promising and enjoyable things in this one."
" Excellent in every single way
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,10,"I cannot insist enough on recommending this film: it is simply excellent. The characters are memorable and wonderfully acted by every single actor in the movie; Guy Pearce shines at making us quiver and Dakota Fanning is breathtaking. The plot is bold in its narrative and very smart in the way it is knitted. Martin Koolhoven knows how to keep the tension throughout the film and to make it even more complex. The symbolic world of the movie is also profound and intelligent. Finally, the music has a classical narrative purpose and is also a plus. Pure cinematographic pleasure."
" a weak script and flawed in many ways
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,3,"Brimstone is flawed in various ways. The characters are underwritten and not interesting enough. The reverend feels like a comic book character and misses complexity. I don't see any internal dilemma or inner struggle. He is mainly 'the evil reverend'. This is also how Pearce performs him and you feel the lack of layers in his performance. If only the director had chosen a Bergmanesque psychology for him – a reverend struggling with his desires instead of him justifying his actions all the time.Liz (Fanning) is also uninteresting. She's mainly a small anxious rabbit (sorry Dutch expression), and she can't think of anything else than fleeing in her struggle with the reverend. She isn't very likable or challenging and misses complexity – therefore it's hard to identify with her. This lack of identification (and therefore tension) is one of the major problems of Brimstone. Often Liz has no goal. This has to do with the way the film is structured. The film is told backwards and this overloads the film with exposition. Each chapter starts with telling us where we are, who these new characters are and how we ended up here.Chapter 1 mainly relies on mystery instead of getting us involved with the main conflict and the problems the hero is going through. Experienced writers know you can build on mystery for a while, but not too long. But Koolhoven takes his time, a lot of time. Chapter 2 the first half an hour is again exposition and the main conflict only comes into play when the reverend returns. If you would have told the film chronologically the amount of unnecessary scenes would immediately have come to the fore. Chapter 3 again has a lot of exposition and feels repetitive. The reverend is saying three times his daughter is not a child anymore. Also, Kit Harington's character seems totally unnecessary. Why do we need to see the scene with the gallows on the toilet? And why didn't those two men kill each other already in the stable? I would have understood Harington's character when he would have been part of the moral journey of Liz. But this is the biggest flaw of the film. Koolhoven doesn't seem aware of her real journey. The only thing she does is running off and the events don't seem to gradually change her. More importantly, it doesn't lead to a Crisis in the third act – the so-called Final Dilemma, where Liz needs to choose between the lesser of two evils, with her making a sacrifice. For example, what if she would have to choose between killing her father but destroying her soul, and saving him? This would have created a central moral question in the film: how far are you allowed to go in destroying Evil? This would have been a real religious theme. Are you allowed to become the devil to conquer the devil, or do you need to stay good at all times? Such a dilemma would have created depth and all elements in the film would have become logical. Why such a reverend, why incest, why told against the background of the lawless Wild West with an eye for an eye mentality, and even Harington's character would have been functional: a good guy who can kill - a step in Liz' moral journey. Even the ending would have become logical when Liz would have killed her father at the cost of her own soul after which she's arrested for a murder she didn't commit. It would have been the hand of God – God's punishment for not making the right choice. The dark ending would have become bearable in all its irony. Instead Koolhoven chooses for a denouement where fate overcomes Liz. And although Liz could have easily defend herself with sign language, Liz is fatalistic, accepts her arrest immediately and commits suicide with a smile. Which of course should make me think she is free at last. She was a strong woman, the voice-over then tells us. Sure! I have a strong impression Koolhoven doesn't know what his film is really about. No, this isn't a film about feminism. Others before me had already concluded there are no strong women in the film. The lack of an underlying debate makes that the film falls apart in ideas and loose ends and this is also why the violence feels inappropriate and over the top. The slow pace in the edit and the horrifying violence betray that Koolhoven wanted to make an epic film in which he wouldn't avoid anything. Koolhoven foremost wanted to impress. You feel that agenda and this for me clarifies the negative reception in the international press. The film's backwards structure only services to hide the film's inner emptiness. Put the film together chronologically and the story is immediately very thin. And isn't it utterly incredible that Liz cuts her own tongue? Only to take on her friend's identity? Instead of choosing to hide herself in that vast country without leaving a trace (like she already did once very successfully as her father wasn't able to find her for like 8 years), Liz chooses a hiding place at least one person knows about.I really tried to like the film. Especially because the film deserves applauding based on the extremely demanding financing and production process. Beforehand I heard that everyone thought the script was superb. Watching the film I really don't understand that qualification, as the script is the film's biggest weakness."
" Calvinist torture movie disguised as feminist western
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,5,"I read somewhere that it was a feminist western. I also read it had a strong (anti) religious message. These two things had me mildly interested, but – boy – was I in for a different ride... The movie is chronologically messed up and I understand why (more on that later). It starts with a mute midwife in a Dutch community, Liz, helping a woman in labor, while a mysterious reverend (Guy Pierce) comes to town. My first thoughts were that this reverend is going to make her life miserable because she is not letting God decide what happens with the women and their children and the rest of the movie will show the struggle between religious conservatism and science based progressNo. That's not what happened. Instead we switch back and forth in time to show that the reverend is actually Liz's father that lusts after her, that she escaped his evil clutches only to be sold into prostitution in a mining colony and that she cut out her own tongue to imitate her dead friend. The film basically is a shower of dread pouring over poor Liz. After 2 hours you are completely numbed by all the dreadful things that happen to her or people she cares about. It's about as ""feminist"" as the original I Spit On Your Grave was, except that it doesn't grant Liz any revenge at all. In other words: the ""feminist"" label is deeply deceiving. In fact, if you hate women and like to see them suffer, then this is an class A movie. The only thing that is feminist about it, is that Liz remains a resilient woman in spite of what happened to her yet not resilient enough to escape prostitution. So, after 2 and a half hours of misfortune, torture and pain you hope that the woman finally gets a chance to take revenge, but instead we get one of the most anti-climatic villain death scenes in cinema history. Then, in the epilogue her daughter expresses what a strong woman she was, as her mother is taken to be hanged. At that point you wonder if the secret message of the movie is how pointless being resilient and rebellious is, which is exactly (!) what orthodox Dutch Calvinism says."
" Less is More; More is Less
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,5,"I have never seen a film like this, one split into two very distinct dichotomous halves. Acts one and two are good, bordering on excellent. The plot is thoroughly intriguing, suspenseful and well paced, neither painfully slow nor hurriedly fast. I really liked the foundation being laid out both in terms of what and how. Fanning's character comes across as genuinely vulnerable in a refreshingly original way and it is clear Joanna is a woman with a difficult past. Pearce's character, the reverend, is the polar opposite, giving his character a real sense of menace with a skillfully understated performance. At the mid-point, I thought 'Wow! This is like ""The Crucible"" meets ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" I was thoroughly gripped. And then...In the second half, all the good work is undone. The story verges on the ridiculous at points as the film tries to explain how the characters had ended up at this point and thrusts us towards a pantomime resolution. There is a sense of overkill about all of this and I began to feel disorientated because of expedient plot and role twists. I am not exaggerating when I say I was speechless as the credits rolled.I wish I liked this film more, for the sake of all those involved in its making. If anything, the story of the making of this film seems far more dramatic and interesting than the film itself. It's such a shame."
" Simply AMAZING
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,10,"How to put it in words? I haven't been left so overwhelmed by a movie since the 2006' illusionist. This is a Masterpiece. This is Cinema. Everything in this movie is perfect: the script is amazing; the filming and editing are beyond words; the acting is perfect. Obviously as as been written, the movie is violent but i would't say that it is not easy to watch: the violence is just there, as a part of the world and its protagonists and no concessions are made in showing it. For me, probably one of the very best movies I ever saw; along with 1986' 8 million ways to die and the 2006' the illusionist. Simply amazing."
" The most satanic movie in a long time
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,1,"This is not a western movie!! It's a pure satanic movie! The goat, the horn, incest, selling children, killing, pedophilia, killing of the lamb, prostitution, rape, all in the name of Satan! Just a horrible horrible movie which should be rated purely as a horror movie. Don't waste your life watching it. This is my first review ever, it was so horrible I had to share."
" Cimono and Calvin
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,4,"This is an amalgam of the more difficult Westerns with big themes and atypical, even anti-heroes, etc etc. At two and half hours it is convinced of its own significance. Unfortunately such delusion and imitation will not be enough to elevate this derivative film to anything like the level of importance to which feels it belongs.Let's consider the duration. In two and half hours Shakespeare managed to do many of his plays, comedies and histories, all better than this. In the same length of time Wagner managed to convey up to 75% of his major works, which by comparison, were more developed artistically than this and also pushed the boundary of the form. By contrast this pretentious Michael Cimono effort, uses length as a cudgel to convince the unsure that it surely must have some merit being as long as it is. But no; it is just long because if it was a standard length the vanity of the writer-director, would not be gratified. There's a portmanteau term - writer-director - that is almost an oxymoron.The story which is the center, the purpose, of this work has certainly been well done in the Western genre. It is curious how the historical reality of 'the West' differs so much from the exploitative imaginations of movie makers which drip with violent fantasy for spectacle. Such predictable cruelty is dull after a short while and also, humorous, because to maintain the level of horror, the filmmaker must raise the degree of violence to greater heights which become less engaging.The degree and style of the violence in this movie is gratuitous but it also could be said to merge with an Old Testament type of narrative and that book had plenty of nasty retribution. Even so, and especially toward the latter third of the film, there is a streak of Calvinism which augments the running cruelty with another layer of moral perspective. Calvin's influence is seen too in the art direction and clothing: it's grim and awful, and black in the wardrobe is essential.The issue of it being entertaining is almost superfluous: this film is too meaningful - at least to its makers - such that the question of entertainment is unnecessary. Borrowing from others; padding the timing; coating a few layers of religious creed won't make the product important or great. At its heart, it is a simple and rather ordinary western tale, which had been done many times, with less slashing and bleeding."
" Really sad and bad
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,1,"This is, first of all, consistent with Hollywood demonizing Christianity. I'm not even a practicing Christian, but I see it in blazing colors in this film. The extreme portrayal by Guy Pearce, whom I love as an actor, is laughable in this role, were it not so horrible in misogyny, sexual perversion, incest...the list goes on. This film is pure schlock. If you are into degradation of women, you might enjoy this trash. Slogging thru till the end is in no way rewarding."
" Brutal and Brooding
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,7,"After watching a movie I like to read up about it to learn how the movie was made, the inspiration for the screenplay and how the cast came together.While reading up on Brimstone I came across an interesting tidbit - the Dutch and European press gave the movies strong reviews, while the American critics were more lukewarm. For some reason, these facts really resonated for me.On the surface, Brimstone should be worthy of praise. Stunning visuals and a strong performance by Guy Pearce, brutal yet not gory violence and a non-linear, but not confusing story structure all work to create a satisfying movie. And more importantly, I believe that the movie delivers on its promise made in the trailer, the viewer will not feel hoodwinked that they were mislead; a la an action movie that is actually slow, or a comedy that turns out to be a boring, coming-of- age drama.Yet, after viewing the movie I could not shake the feeling of being let down, empty and unmoved. The goal of any film in my mind is to have the ability to stay with a viewer, and I felt as though Brimstone reminded me of a very well made straight to video movie.The example I will use is having a one night stand with a pretty girl yet you wake up the next morning without feeling elated. She looks the part and has a welcoming personality, but you have no interest in her.That's the feeling you get with this movie. Great cinematography and powerful acting, but I believe the missing link is a great story. There is no twist and no real character arc. It is a simple tale of hardship and revenge that tries to elevate itself through a non-linear telling.Final comment: Solid and violent tale in a western setting, with an average story and somewhat non satisfying ending."
" As dark as it gets
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,7,"I have read a few reviews regarding this movie and all of them have said it's dark, violent and not for the faint of heart. Those definitions are fine, however I still do not think this is enough to describe the tone of the movie. I would describe it as ruthless and depressing. This does not mean I didn't enjoy it, as you can tell by my rating, however the point of a review is to warn a potential viewer of what they are getting themselves into and this movie is as dark as I have seen. It is unlike any western that I have ever seen as it is not traditional. It's so unique that I would have given this a bit of a higher rating if it wasn't so hard to watch. I do not want to ruin any of the plot as it made the movie more interesting for me just based on what I had seen in the trailers. I can see why it was set in the western time period due to the realism of the material. A movie like this set in our times would have been impossible to make, and if they did it would not have been executed as well as this. The acting was quite impressive. It truly feels like each actor really threw themselves in their roles, which is incredible for some as there are some twisted characters in this film. Which brings me to Guy Pearce who played the role of 'The Reverend'. He plays such an awful man that I have no idea how he would have been able to shake this off after filming was completed. I cannot remember the last time I hated a character as much as a despised him. Dakota Fanning was also amazing in her role. She was convincing from start to finish with many different emotions throughout the movie. She also needed to use facial expressions more than dialogue in the movie, which cannot not be an easy task to complete, but she nailed it! When I had first seen the length of the movie I was concerned it would have major passing issues, it did not. The story grabs you from the beginning to the end, I couldn't stop watching. I had no idea how it would end and could not wait to find out. The most impressive part is it really did not have a lot of action, just characters that grabbed your attention whether good or bad. It was well written. So if you are not of the faint of heart and can handle a very dark, ruthless, depressing story that is still entertaining from start to finish see this movie, you won't regret it."
" Worryingly Disturbing, But So Is Reality!
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,8,"As a Western fan, I really enjoyed this movie, the directing, scenery and cinematography are very beautiful and nice to look at! The story is also very compelling, as it seems real and touches on the controversial topic of the difficult lives of women, however, I still wait for a contemporary movie about such difficulties, as physical, verbal and sexual abuse. It's still happening (no matter where you live!)and instead of making movies about a different century (where people cannot relate to), there should be movies about the contemporary problems and issues of women. Since the director is Dutch, I liked that the Reverend and his family are also Dutch, although he could not pull off the accent. I would have also preferred another actress instead of Carice van Houten, as she appears too modern and sexy - this sexiness which she also showed in Game of Thrones was probably enough to seduce Guy Pearce in real life. Apart from Pearce's creepiness and perversity, Dakota Fanning is the real star in this movie. She really impressed me. She was different in every scene, constantly shifting between being fierce, vulnerable, strong, attractive and frightened. I'm happy that she and Kit Harington were chosen at the end, as the previous actors who were under contract for this movie, Wasikowska and Pattinson, are horrible actors. No range and no facial expressions. They would have destroyed this movie and the audience could not have been able to relate to their characters and feel Liz' sorrows. Yes, the Reverend is sadistic, he is a pervert and ruthless. So is society. I can imagine that many perverts and creeps will watch this movie to satisfy their needs and debauched minds. I don't think that they will feel ashamed of themselves by watching it, as those people cannot be healed. Moreover, I want to give my personal opinion about the director Martin Koolhoven. I followed him on Twitter and read a few of his posts about religions and Islam. First, he defended his movie being not sadistic, but rather a feminist approach to a male-oriented Western movie. He asked for objective point of views and not being ignorant in their statements. However, he is also the same person who posts anti-Islam rants and pigeonholes them all. He reacted to those gay protesters who were marching for Moslems because of the travel ban in the US and claimed that the Moslems in return would have killed them, etc. Is this not an ignorant statement of him? Not everyone is the same. Just because he presents the Reverend as evil in the movie does not also mean that every Christian is evil. There are many modern, sophisticated, gay, feminist Moslems in the world. In addition, these Moslems criticize each other, too and hate those old-fashioned, stupid, misogynistic fellow believers. I think he should also try to be careful in his rants and arguments, because as far as I know, filmmakers, writers and artists are open-minded and peaceful people who are not ignorant about other cultures and religions and can distinguish between good and evil."
" Deep Dark Movie
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,3,"This movie will definitely upset viewers mind. In whole movie director just wants to show that villain is like superman. He knows everything he can see everything he can predict anything, he can reach everywhere regardless of any logic. When movie starts it seems to be a good going but as it progresses it converts into one direction where in whole movie villain do his evil things and everybody else in movie just for dying. -Its not entertaining. -Its not message giving or thinking movie -It not kind of emotional or sad movies Its some mix kind of Horror and Disturbing Movie where good people die without any logic without any equal fight against evil and Evil men do as he wants in whole movie and even he cannot be touched. So I Suggest please don't watch it otherwise you will disturb your mind."
" obscene
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,1,"A distasteful movie, such that I can't think of another human being that I would be comfortable watching this with.From the get go, you are told in no uncertain terms that this is to be one of those cliché feminism films, yes one of those black and white men = bad women = good, to be shovelled down the audience's throats from start to finish with the subtlety of a cow pat.Alongside this, paedophilia, and incest cling to every nook and cranny, throw in some animal slaughter porn for good measure, and we have a nasty minded, mean spirited and repulsive produce."
" A for the villain, B for the plot, F for the real sermon
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,4,"I was drawn in by the introduction of the sinister preacher, a wonderful portrayal with great cinematography. But it was downhill from there. It's all black and white caricatures, no heroes with weaknesses, no villains with saving graces, as if any nod to realism risked muddying the all-important sermon being shoved down our throats with a zeal approaching that of the villain himself. Every male character is either outrageously cruel or utterly ineffectual. Feminists will be thrilled and herald it as a documentary."
" Basically serial killer child molestation porn
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,3,"Don't watch this thinking it's a western. The only thing this movie has in common with westerns is the time period. This movie is basically filler material between explicit violence against women and children behind a cloak of rabid fundamentalism. I wasted two hours of life on this move, even skipping ahead here and there didn't help. It's one of those movies where I thought it might get good because it seemed to have some potential, and I was still waiting when the credits started rolling."
" Dense, full of stereotypes
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,1,"The gorgeous, saintly woman getting chased by an evil corrupted priest. She wears a lot of makeup, and has perfect hair in the middle of the night. This is a masturbatory fantasy by a religion hater. I can't believe how shallow and stereotypical these characters are. And predictable. Worst movie of the year by this admitted cinephile."
" Mad Movie Musings: Brimstone
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,8,"Guy Pearce plays the most diabolically disturbed deacon west of the Mississippi in this most wicked of westerns from Dutch director Martin Koolhoven. Divided into four Biblically themed chapters (Revelation, Exodus, Genesis and Retribution), the story reveals the history and eventual fate of our heroine (Dakota Fanning), along with her relationship to the malevolent minister. Hell imagery throughout, which is appropriate for a preacher to whom sadism (and a whip) is no stranger. This tale is not for the faint-of-heart, so caution to those who may seek to enter. Moments recall The Night of the Hunter, and the whole thing is centered by a sturdy and expressive performance from Miss Fanning.(I'm an enthusiast, not a critic. Thanks for reading.)"
" Awful
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,1,"Not every 2.5-hour film is an artistic one. That is what they were going for here clearly, because it looked deliberately different from mainstream. At least they tried to make it look like one. So what you get is fine production of a story that isn't there. O.K. photography of scenes that might as well belong to a hunting magazine. And eventually adding up to a ruthlessly, arrogantly empty film that seems to pride on not even trying to give any hope of drama. Any attempt at defending this as art, mass art, folklore, or even a tale that might have moral against the religious zealous is doomed to be ridiculous."
" very well built but poor 1st character
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,6,"The movie is very well built.The edit was quite good and something new. However, Liz character is quite crude! it's not the problem of playing. Dakota has played very well but the writer has created a poor, very dumb character who would have done nothing smart to save herself and her family."
" Great storytelling.
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,7,"At first I didn't want to watch this movie because of the name, but I'm glad I did. This story shows a glimpse of how hard it must have been for women back in the day! Perverts using religion to cover up their messed up heads!! This just shows the tip of the iceberg of all the struggles they were going through! People want to imagine ""little house on the prairie"" but this movie actually went there and showed some reality!"
" Miserable film that will guarantee disappointment
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,2,"It appears they have divided the film plot into 4 parts. Someone has then shuffled those 4 parts and decided to play them out in a random order. Why not stick to chronological order? I understand that it is a good verses evil, but don't get the descriptions of a strong women battling. Guy Pearce plays a vile religious paedophile, amongst his victims is Emilia Jones as Joanna. It is a vile tale that I can see the reason for it to have been made or for us to watch it. It is just beating, hanging, torturing and rape of women and young girls. You want there to be real justice in a tale so miserable, not just more misery.For Game of Thrones fans you may be drawn (as I was) by it having Kit Harrington in the cast, but he's just a small cameo who has no real effect on the plot.At the end of it you won't feel any reward for wasting your time watching it and you won't want to recommend it to anyone. So please don't. If you want to see film of this style made with a better plot watch Cold Mountain, the Revenant or the Hateful Eight."
" A Unique Horror Western Combination With The DeFacto Morality Theme
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,7,"Brimstone plays as a 4-act western with heavy elements of a lawless and immoral time elevated to the brink of a horror movie. In other words it's 100% dark. It certainly has deep themes one can decipher differently and wrapped in mystery which the two middle acts slowly unfold like nested Faberge eggs of what it is about.A lot rests on the performances of ""The Reverend"" played by Guy Pierce and Dakota Fanning's Liz. Pearce has played heavies before and he exponentially multiplies it with a devilish off-the-charts creep factor which makes him, perhaps, the most hated celluloid villain imaginable. Dakota Fanning proves in one fell swoop she's not going to be remembered only as child actress. With slight dialog (she wasn't always mute) she proves how amazing she can be when given an exceptional role. It's great to see a classic western (the good/the bad) re-invented in such a way that the morality play is totally fresh. Brimstone is a harrowing ride from the start right up until the lastand like a train wreck you simply can't help turn away from. It's not like anything the long playing genre has seen so be aware the consensus seems to be highly polarized. This reviewer found it worthy, your mileage may vary."
" It Certainly Sucks You In
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,8,"Well, I thought I was paying strict attention and getting the gist of everything until the last 10 minutes or so. Then, I had to go back and replay a couple scenes more than once to make sure I hadn't missed the denouement. (At the risk of being thought a pedant, please allow me to insert the following: Denouement: the final part of a play, movie, or narrative in which the strands of the plot are drawn together and matters are explained or resolved.)Yep. That telling moment when it all comes together and you say to yourself, ""Aha! That's why she did that and he gave her what for and then all those other guys ended up dead."" Ahem. You get what I mean.For making me feel perplexed and a bit like I was treading water (pun intended), I have to blame someone-----so, I am going to blame the script writers. Should I blame the director? The film editors? Beats me. All I know is: for a while there I thought maybe ""Liz"" was undergoing some sort crazy disremembering thing. Not ""getting it"" kinda ruined the ending for me, just a bit.The cast is wonderful. The way this is filmed is terrific. The scenery is extremely eye-pleasing.Be prepared for major plot holes, however. I kept saying to myself, ""Well. That was stupid. Why didn't she . . ."" And so on. There's plenty of need for suspension of disbelief. But it's so much fun watching and waiting to see what's going to happen next, I think that fact should be overlooked.The time sure went fast, while watching this. I really enjoyed seeing Kit Harrington as a cowboy. I found having ""Melisandre"" in the same film as ""Jon Snow"" a bit distracting, though.And I must admit that I was absolutely waiting and waiting and waiting to see Carice van Houten's breasts again, as I think she has the prettiest boosies ever. We barely caught a glimpse, though, which is a real shame. Why show the bar girls' subpar tatas and not revel in Carice's glorious ones? Her chest could have done with a little more screen time, is all I'm saying.Other reviewers wrote about the graphic violence. Yeah, there's a plethora of gory scenes. Life was tough back then. Papa Preacher was an over-the-top sadistic, screwed up maniac, that's for sure. I think the gore went to character. Personally, I could have done without the dying pig.In summary: I liked this movie. It definitely has entertainment value."
" That escalated quickly
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,8,"The movie starts in the middle of the story, seemingly starting as a confrontation between a practical mute midwife and a very religious reverend with different views on life, quickly moving from mystery to thriller to horror. In a structure similar to Memento (also starring Pearce), the next section is a flashback showing the events leading up to the first part, and the one following that another flashback to the events prior to that, slowly unfolding the complete story; before continuing the events of the first part, which is pretty straightforward (but disturbing) horror.I didn't have any idea what the movie was about before I watched it, expecting a Western. And the unexpected turns made the movie more interesting to me. Wanting to figure out what had happened before and why, drew me into the movie.The movie is not perfect at all. There are some plot holes and weird decisions made by the characters. The acting was good but a bit distant, which fit the characters but it was hard to connect. The actress playing Joanna (Emilia Jones) was the standout performance for me. I enjoyed Pearce's performance too, but his accent is a little curious, especially considering there are native speakers with the proper accent to make it a little distracting, but maybe non-native speakers won't mind that as much as I did.The movie is very pretty, with a nice soundtrack. The movie surprised me and I enjoyed the structure and the look of the film, which make me like it despite its flaws."
" Deep and Disturbing Misogynist
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,1,"If this is what passes as good film-making these days, then time for a new medium. I agree with reviewers who say the synopsis is nothing like the actual film.Let's face it, if the film were aptly described it would read:Hateful one dimensional men who are cruel and debasing toward all female characters. A brief unexplained respite of a pseud-good semi-hero that is immediately shot so the torturous world of woman hating can resume. The film as a whole is tasteless and these founding fathers of religion and the west leave a really bad taste. Fire, brimstone and punishment along with a whole lot of meaningless twists and turns.I can take a film that meanders and doesn't have a happy ending- Manchester by the Sea delivers this style much better in my books. However Brimstone appears to be written, directed and filmed by men and women who are so desperate for cash they couldn't turn down the work. I shudder to think any sane or rational person would think this film worthy of making. Simply put, there is nothing enlightening or entertainingly about this film. On top of it, the ridiculous film noir ending doesn't make it pass the sniff test.Definitely one for torture porn enthusiasts and not in a good way. Bleh."
" The worst movie ever created!
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,1,"How a movie that supports a children's exposure to domestic violence, crime and sexual abuse could get such a high rating? How a movie like that was even allowed in Hollywood? I refuse to believe that this is OK in the 21st century! Who the F*k even allowed #martinkoolhoven to put it on the big screen? #brimstone #theworstmoviever #martinkoolhoven #theworstdirector"
" Wow, this is what cinema is all about!
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,9,"I came into this film with moderate expectations and was completely blown away by the quality of the cinematography. The unorthodox yet ingenious order of the character development, the magnificent scene settings and backdrop, the sound and scoring, and the superb acting by EVERY actor (including the children)- it all paved the way for a spectacular cinematic experience.**SPOILERS | DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM**I really wanted to give this film a 10 out of 10, and at one point I was sure that I would give it a 10/10.The reason why I only gave it a 9 out of 10 is simple: the screenplay writing was flawed and lent itself towards some annoying moments where the characters made excruciatingly dumb and illogical decisions that either got them killed or at least resulted in extreme consequences.-Example 1: Liz (Dakota Fanning) should have shot The Reverend dead while she was outside on the porch with the Winchester Repeating Rifle aimed at his chest. Instead, she stupidly chose to put down the rifle and run inside to check on her daughter. Thus she got tied up and her daughter got whipped.-Example 2: Matthew (the son) stopped the horse carriage and then proceeds to be killed by The Reverend's perfect sniper fire ambush in zero-visibility snowstorm conditions. It was very hard to accept that this was written into the screenplay.-Example 3: Samuel (Kit Harington) has a chance to free Joanna in the church, and points the pig-killing pistol at The Reverend but walks right up next to him at point blank range, and then turns away briefly only to have The Reverend wrestle the gun back at him, thus resulting in Samuel's death.Aside from these screen writing flaws, the film was marvelous and represents everything that cinematography is supposed to be.Acting: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Sound/Scoring: 10/10 Scenery/Setup: 10/10 Screen writing/Character Decisions: 6/10Movie Overall: 9/10Thank you for such a great film."
" The Director should find some other job to do.
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,1,"The film has a story based on sexual violence to children, pedophilia and incest.Acting is terrible almost amateurish, while its low budget nature is obvious. Dakota Fanning is pathetic, she must be really desperate, to land a role in such a horrific sick flick. Someone give her a role in a C movie to save her career.The Director has done a really awful job, it was apparent that in order to hide his incompetence, he resorted on the good old trick of gruesome, horror style violence against women, teenagers and children as young as 5-6 years old who are raped, tortured, and killed. I am sure that my 15 year old nephew could have done a much better job in building this story without the necessity of nauseating the audience.If you are a sadist or a misogynist or a pedophile maybe you will enjoy the film, all others stay away and watch a TV shopping channel, for sure it will be far more entertaining..."
" One of the worst movies
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,1,"Don't waist your time watching this movie. Really unrealistic, poor Terrantino wanna be. The evil one can do anything and be everywhere all the time and every one else acts with the IQ of a sheep. The only thing this movie is about, is making violent, disgusting scenes to shock the viewers. And this is not working very well, and the story is without direction or meaning."
" Great,horrible, and thought provoking at the same time
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,10,"Kudos to the director - this is my first review ever but I had to invoke my opinion. The film is a masterpiece. It has all of the elements you would imagine with a name like brimstone. Is it violent? Absolutely. Is it realistic? More than likely, except for the constant return of the reverend. I watched it last night and slept maybe a total of three hours. It is so thought provoking. The violence is relentless and is hard to watch but it certainly makes you think - and it should. There are scenes that are extremely disturbing, but you should be disturbed. The acting is fantastic, the scenery is beautiful, and the haunting religious imagery is overpowering. Looking forward to more movies from the director."
" Not as advertised
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,1,"Is it possible to ""un-see"" a movie? I wish I could erase the last couple of hours from my memory. Have you sat through the first fifty minutes and are hoping it's going to get better? It's not. You're at 1 hour 20 and still hoping? Give up. This is not Tarantino. It's not building up to something monumental. It's just awful, soulless. Bleuh."
" Great Acting and Script that Mesmerizes
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,8,"This movie puts me in mind of people who stop to look at a horrible deadly car crash. To watch a horrible tragedy can make some of us feel better to say we ""can't look away,"" but really it's that we don't want to look away. It's normal sadomasochistic urges and fantasies that everyone has a certain degree of — the desire to think about or imagine hurting or being hurt — combined with normal exhibitionist and voyeuristic feelings, the interest in what is hidden and secret. It's the weaving of both of these sides, which is as old as time. I hate to admit it but this movie gives us excellent acting and great music, cinematography, scenery, and script that as I said mesmerizes and you can't stop watching. However, when it was at it's conclusion I just felt like I needed a stiff drink or to find the funniest movie ever produced and watch it. Quickly for relief. This movie is just too depressing. Dark movie. I am so depressed from watching this movie. I wish I had just stopped watching it but I kept thinking at some point the story would change direction to create a positive mood. I only wish someone had warned me as I am warning you, the reader of this review. Unless you like morbid don't watch."
" Extremes of human nature in anti-feminine space
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,7,"The movie could seem confusing because it's made of several stories intertwined though inter-generational time-line. These stages wrap the main theme in itself and, in a fine way put it to the beginning on the very end. Makes this perpetuity one of it's points: how some flaws and psychological elements haunt us through generations. Almost like a curse, a generational misfortune. Film is also making a strong point about extremes of human nature, which is I guess one of the main subjects of the author. And wide span it is (the human nature): from the harsh violence to the best of strength and excellence against it. Put in strong inter-generational context of parent-child. The movie is not simple and is really SLOW, even for a more conservative viewers. The tone of human nature and violence in it reminded me in some moments of ""There Will Be Blood"" (for from a comparison please) and many more such psychological-driven dramas. Wouldn't recommend it to non-lovers of psychological drama put in a anti-feminine time frame and wilderness of western surrounding."
" Confused
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed it, there were some great scenes and great acting. But it left me confused.I'm not really sure why the same (ish) story played out over and over again. Perhaps it is reference to religious text, but I wish it was explained.As far as I could tell, the same characters were living a dozen lives simultaneously, each as corrupt as the last"
" Disappointed
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,4,"don't waste your precious time !! The movie has a pretension that it is a masterpiece but it fails greatly and lacks the depth. ! Full of violence without purpose, with unrealistic scene and despite so much violence it doesn't give you any emotions at all. Really regretting my time wasting over it. So if you are looking forward to a serious movie or a masterpiece, I warn you not to watch otherwise it's fine."
" Definitely not what it says on the label
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,2,"I just got back from watching Brimstone and it made an impression, in fact I'm rather upset for wasting 2.5 hours and now having vivid flashbacks of sickening scenes. So, where to begin... First mistake that I could not believe had been made this day and age: a person with part of their tongue cut off cannot speak or make any vocal sounds...seriously?! *Unnecessary sign language ensues for dramatic effect*It was supposed to be a ""western, mystery, thriller"" which seemed interesting. Unfortunately the plot line on this site was the only mystery about this film. A thriller then? Not unless you find endless amounts of mostly pointless violence thrilling. I generally don't mind violence when it serves a purpose to the story, as the here imitated Tarantino is such a master of. There is so much of it and so graphic that it's shocking (as probably intended) at first, but not that much further down the line you just shut off and wish this pile of misery ends quickly... which it doesn't. It seems endless. The story is simple and could easily have been told in 1.5 hours, so why did it have to be so ff-in long?! If I had to describe the genre: drama, with western and horror elements. The variety of violence was the only surprising thing about this film, just when you wonder whether this or that kind of torture will be graphically portrayed it's provided. #spoiler# There's no subtlety or nuance to be found anywhere. I find the characters over the top, the story line boring, motives and background story lacking and no real sense of purpose with the time-line mix-up and unnecessary scenes. The moment she sees the reverend you know it's going to end with her killing him - by the by, how did he get himself into that position and how on earth does he keep finding her?! Nothing makes sense-. The anti climax of our main character FINALLY setting fire to- and shooting the baddie is only worsened by her anticlimactic death soon after: this film's final lash to the viewers raw back. No sense of the promised sweet revenge or a sense of well earned peace after a lifetime of misery. No. Just our heroine giving up after some douchebags come to claim her because ""her past has run up with her"". This film will leave you feeling abused; don't watch it. If you're looking to feel sad at the end of a gripping drama with a feminist message and star cast, go see Million Dollar Baby. If you want violence, blood and gore with a great cast, story line and wittiness, go watch a recent Tarantino."
" Not stirring nor shaking anything
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,1,"This film was hailed as a masterpiece here in the Netherlands. I can tell you it's far from that. The director called his work 'Koolhoven's Brimstone'...like to underline that this is his ultimate, monumental work. It's laughable. Wow..i'v heard so much about it in the press over here..like this is a must see masterpiece. Well, it's awful..barely watchable...all clichés so common in dutch filmmaking pass by... I'v heard that this is a huge movie about violence against woman and that woman prevail in the end. The story is obnoxious.. stupid scenes like a guy who gets blasted trough a window 'cause of a bullet hitting him. Over the top & silly scenes...the pace is awful it leads to nothing..the acting of the cast is merely mediocre...especially Guy Pierce's role is sooo unconvincing. I'v heard promising stories of the shocking scenes that would keep you awake at night..so horrendous. I never saw one scene that came close to such an emotion. It's a long and boring feature...that holds a very unoriginal approach and filled with (dutch) movie clichés. A film that shows why the majority of mainstream dutch movies suck! It lacks every hint to originality and never rises above the level of a high school movie project. It's a disaster"
" Brimstone is a classic, in my Top 5 western movies
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,9,"I have seen the western thriller Brimstone four times on the big screen (spread over a half year).This movie is an overwhelming experience and gives a completely new, modern angle to the western. It has different remarkable elements:  The everyday harshness of Unforgiven  The haunting threat of Cape Fear and Don't Look Now  The flash-backs and flash-forwards of Once Upon a Time in America  The tone of voice of The Piano  The business practicality of McCabe & Mrs. Miller  The countryside community of Witness  The matriarchal message of Once Upon a Time in the WestThis great movies brings all this in original and convincing manner with great acting, especially Guy Pearce, Dakota Fanning and Emilia Jones. I think Brimstone is a classic, definitely in my Top 5 western movies."
" The cult classic of 2017
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,10,"It's hard to pinpoint this movie in a particular genre. It has elements of thriller, western, psychological horror and drama. I saw this movie on two occasions in the theaters. I think this movie is going to have a long breath among the cinema freaks. If you are looking for a conventional movie experience, please look further... Excessive violence? check. Dark atmosphere? check. Not easy to understand? check. Great acting? check. Individualistic director? check. Small budget? check. Will it stick on you for better or worse? check. Accessible for large (American) crowds. No...Fantastic!"
" A beautiful, gruesome and dark story about a girl and a man
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,8,"I was not really interested in this movie when I first heard about it. But when I read and saw that the movie was dark and it had a pretty decent cast, I became really interested. A week later I bought a ticket and I went to see Brimstone in the cinema.The movie Brimstone portrays a thrilling and dark story, but is has the very accurate characteristics of a western. When watching Brimstone it really felt like I was there in that place and that exact time of period, which is a very rare effect you don't often see or feel in a film. I've read many reviews saying that the brutality was too much. Personally, I found it beautiful. It makes you empathize with the characters in a way you don't often experience. It makes you feel like you are becoming the character. Yes, the movie is gruesome, but you must try to appreciate this.The way the whole story is told really appealed to me. The movie is divided into four chapters that show the 'what', the 'how', the 'why' and the 'Endgame'. Because of this way of storytelling, you can watch the movie without getting spoiled the vast amount of answers. It really gives the viewer the question marks why that event is happening and why the character is behaving that way. Because of this the film is not dragging. All chapters have their own tension that is being build up, and is later being released at the end of each episode which keeps the viewer sitting on the edge of the chair. Brimstone also contains a very good plot and a beautiful score. The movie is slow paced, but the viewer is not going to get bored.The acting overall was great in Brimstone. Especially Dakota Fanning (Liz) and Emilia Jones (Joanna). They both did an amazing job portraying the characters. Guy Pearce was superb with his portrayal of The Reverend. He really was the finishing touch of this movie.My congratulations go to Martin Koolhoven for his international film debut. What a cunning movie."
" I wouldn't stop you from seeing it, but there are definitely better movies in theater right now.
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,6,"The thing about this movie is that it's quite a long movie and after a while you really start to notice it. My biggest issue with long movies, over two hours, is that I start to wander off if its not really exciting, and I definitely did watching this movie. The story line isn't that good and unique to keep you hooked and there is to much difference in acting (performance wise). Some actors play there roles better than others and by the way this movie is constructed it leads to a kinda bumpy ride. Different chapters in this movie don't continue smoothly and that contributes to the feeling of a long sit. On top of that there are some scenes that don't seem to be necessary to create a good story and only make the movie feel even longer. Don't get me wrong, this movie isn't horrible, parts of this movie are really good, and although there are some really bad parts it still tells you a nice story. Its just the noticeable long sit that makes this movie not stand out from the rest and sometimes a bit boring."
" WoW! How impressive...
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,9,"This is my first review, I strongly felt that I have to give my opinion about this movie. Especially because of some bad reviews below which I don't agree. You know Brimstone is a cruel film and anti women. It takes place in a time when women means very little towards men. So if you don't like this, you should not see this movie. The movie is divided in 4 periods in time. After each period you know more about the characters. Every period contains a lot of violence and is most of the time very anguished. The actors are really great, especially Pearce and Fanning, and how the movie is filmed is also special. For example the angles from above.There is a lot of violence in the movie and I really could not see some scenes but it is a movie where you think about for a long time. Really impressive, I only know a few movies that give you this strange feeling after the movie. You have different emotions. Even though the movie is a bit slow this is not disturbing. I didn't see the movie as a real western, especially because of the role of women in this movie. Sorry for my English because I am Dutch. I am a woman of 45 Years. I recommend this movie to everybody who can see a mix of violence and religion especially towards women."
" Two hours of psychopaths is too much
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,1,"Waisted TOPtalent (director, cast) because the story is no good. Characters do not develop at all, no mystery at all..just a lot of blood and death. No historical foundation, because for example a minister or vicar is always surrounded (in Protestantism) by elders-ten. So no vicar could ever do these things not-being- watched..and don't underestimate the 'watchers' in the dynamic of something happening like this. So this is more of a catholic priest with much more power, to get to this point. Of course rare events happen, and there are people going mad and can be psychotic about religion and sex..but this has nothing to do with religion itself..people go crazy about the tiniest things, if it is inside them to 'split up'. So this story is about a lunatic and to watch this lunatic for two hours is too much for me. Why wasting such great talents and money for such a boring, horrifying story? There's horror enough in the daily news. So, in my eyes, even the most beautiful images can not hide the lack of content.Thereby: I'm very worried about the development of the cinema, because stories get worse, technique's grow, and money reigns. Like as if investing in rockets, they cost a lot, and most of them never reach their destiny..because they do not know where to go. So we get all this stuff in our stratosphere which hides the real stories..which can also be horrifying, but they will tell us WHY en WHEREFORE..Plain nonsense this is..because it is not about common religion, like it was brought to America from Europe. Religion (see f.e. Scientology) can be even more dangerous, because it is hidden in everything..and it is so close to the truth that people can hardly distinguish it from the truth.So be smart and don't go to this movie, it saves you money and many bad influences, because there's enough of this already."
" A dark epic of survival that depicts the dark side of not only religion but the wild west itself
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,9,"This is one of the very few movies that managed to shock me, and i have seen allot of crazy things in my life.The story in short: From the moment The new reverend climbs pulpit, Liz knows she, and here whole family are grave danger. Following Liz in her struggle to escape from the man that haunts her, we also witness her past that will reveal as to why this man is following her without mercy.What i thought of the movie: (Note:I am in no way a movie reviewer (or a reviewer at all). i thought it was a great movie with really solid performance form the entire cast (though Kits American accent wasn't really that great), the way Dakota and Guy presented the relation between they'r characters really made movie feel tense since it is obvious from the start that there is something more going on between them (The moment Liz sees the Reverend you know there is something more going on). The way they divided the movie in 4 chapters was a good choice in my opinion since it gives them a good way to make time jumps (each chapter tells a part of Liz her struggle against the Reverend). The movie is VERY slow paced, the first 2 chapters really take they'r time and only from about half of chapter 3 the movie increases its pace. But i like this a ton (allot of people will disagree), it really gives you the feeling that this is something that Liz deals with since child hood.The way this movie represents religion, female oppression, and heritage is really beautiful but shocking at the same time. It really shows how someone's interpretation of the bible in this case, can make them just straight up nut cases, while they think that they are just doing gods will. Also the way they show how women were abused and really just seen as tools, be that for the pleasure of outlaws etc or the hard working women in Christian family's is great. It also show that your heritage doesn't have to define who you are, even though raised in a very strict Christian family Liz just does not want to be part of that kind of world. And here struggle as to be free of that is just amazing to witness,Now, this movie is not for the faint of heart, There is child chastising, Murder, execution, (almost child rape), although we have seen murder and execution before, the tone of the movie and way it shows really makes it sickening, and the fact that those kind of things really did happen at that time really makes it feel authentic, also in the way that actions don't come without consequences. In short, i really think people need to see this movie, not just for enjoyment. but also as food for thought, since it really is a thought provoking movie. at least for me."
" B movie pretending to be art-house...
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,5,"The IMDb story line for this movie mentions 'unforgiving cruelty of a hell on earth'. That pretty much sums up the viewing experience I had. I like violence on screen if done in a tasteful manner, when it serves the story and has any actual meaning. The movies from Paul Verhoeven come to mind as great examples or Michael Haneke. But Brimstone is no Robocop or Funny Games and this director sure isn't Verhoeven or Haneke. This is no social commentary or essay on violence. It's a rape-revenge-story without the revenge.Brimstone plays like a B-type slasher / suspense flick with a ton of relentless cruel violence added on top of it. Sometimes it is used to good effect for example to depict the dire situation of how women were treated in the good old west. But this movie is no real examination of women rights during that period nor does it delve deeper in the godlike rights religious men bestowed upon themselves. Like I said it''s essentially a B-flick including a scene were a body is fed to the pigs. So OK this movie isn't very intellectually grounded. How about entertaining? Not really. The movie is very very slowly paced. It has a structure that is told out of sync (a bit like Memento) which actually saves this movie from being a total waste of good actors. That being said the film totally collapses in the last act. To put it short, after our main character endures a lot of bizarre hardship, cruelty and torture she finally gets to confront the bad guy in what is maybe the most anti-climatic scene I have ever seen. No sweet revenge or happy end to justify what just transpired on the screen. The bad guy dies in unspectacular fashion and as a reward our heroine is drowned. The end. I gave it 5 stars as this movies has some forgiving qualities. The acting is generally good and the first act of the movie is really suspenseful before it all falls apart. I like that the director seemingly didn't compromise to show us how bad the old West most likely was. But without any clear vision all the violence is just nasty for the sake of being nasty."
" Probably the worst experience of my life
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,1,"In a sentence: it feels like 10 hours long.The plot is pushed backward and backward and it is unnecessary most of the times.The villain is so over the top to be beyond ridiculous. The violence is displayed for the purpose of displaying it, till it is simply saturated and you don't care about it anymore.The real violence is made towards the audience that has to wait an unspeakable amount of time to finally see the end credits.The themes are just drowned into a sea of useless scenes, inserted in the movie only to justify the casting of some actors. I wish HBO paid more money to Kit Harington so he doesn't have to be in such movies to pay the bills."
" This is why we go to the movies.
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,10,"Howard Hawks once said that a good movie is ""three good scene and no bad ones"". That would make Martin Koolhoven's Brimstone beyond good - great even. You know you're watching a masterpiece when not three, not five, but nearly every scene is a work of art. A powerful combination of character, conflict, beauty and above all truth. And Koolhoven's truth is in the details, the blocking of a scene, the poignant rendering of a back lit saddle creating a striking metaphor or even the empty gun pointed at an whore-abusing coal miner - helping him to climax by the very thought of violence. This is what makes cinema different from theater or television - its power to tell story through images and action rather than words. How fitting that the lead character has no tongue to speak with - but still manages to steal the show. Fanning and Pearce are true gems and shine bright in this dark epic. It's not a film for the faint-hearted or god-fearing - but I truly hope my generation will be able to appreciate a thing of beauty like this and not be disappointed at the absence of Tarantino-like crowd pleasers. This is not a self conscious meta western, but a real story about human's struggle with religion, violence and above all man's fear of women. Koolhoven has given us in the Netherlands something to be proud of again - Cinema with balls that confronts and provokes. I'm sure many people will be offended, disgusted - and so should they - the world is not as depicted in the Marvel universe, where no action has real consequences. In this time of populism and mass manipulation we need people like Martin Koolhoven who are willing to spend years perfecting their craft - creating fiction that reveals the truth our reality obscures. Go and see for yourself - Love it - Hate it - Ten years from now we'll still be talking about this film."
