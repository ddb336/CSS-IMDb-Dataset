I can't believe Jake Gyllenhaal didn't get any award."
" What is the link between fiction and real life?
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,8,"""Nocturnal animals"" is the second film by Tom Ford and was eagerly awaited after the success of ""A single man"" (2009).""Nocturnal animals"" is a film with a controversial opening, a mysterious ending and a complicated plot structure. I will not tell anything about the opening or the ending, but I will say a few words about the complicated plot structure.Main character of the movie is Susan Morrow (Amy Adams), a trendy gallery owner married with her second husband Hutton (Armie Hammer). One day she receives the manuscript of a book by her first husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal), which is dedicated to her.The film contains three story's.
The present of the marriage of Susan and Hutton.
The past of the romance between Susan and Edward.
The fiction of the novel of Edward dedicated to Susan.The link between the past story and the present story is clear enough. In the past art was a passion for Amy, now it is a trade. In the past the great fear of Amy was to become just like her mother, now she has become just like her mother. She has married the ""reliable"" husband her mother liked, and of their marriage only a facade for the outside world is remaining.The link between the fictitional story, which looks like a Sam Peckinpah movie full of darkness and violence, and the real story is more elusive. For a moment you might think that the fictitional story contains autobiographical elements from the life of Susan and Edward when they were still together. One indication is the remark of Edward that all fiction has an autobiographical element in the ""past story"". Another indication is the casting of the different stories. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a character in the real story and a character in the fictitional story. Isla Fisher, who plays the wife of Jake Gyllenhaal in the fictitional story, looks very much like Amy Adams.On a certain point in the movie you have to come to the conclusion that the fictitional story is not about Susan and Edward. The question however remains if and which link exists between the two stories. The manuscript is not dedicated to Susan for no reason, isn't it? It is up to the spectator to answer this question. I still don't know the answer exactly.I do know however that the film is not only complex but also very beautiful, as is to be expected from a fashion designer like Ford. The present day story plays in very sterile settings, in which the ""beau monde"" is keeping up appearances at all costs. The fictitional story plays in ""fly over country"" as we know it from the films of the Coen brothers."
" The Narrative Layers of Revenge
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,8,"Nocturnal Animals is the second film by fashion designer-turned-filmmaker Tom Ford, and comes seven years after his debut drama A Single Man. Any skepticism about Ford's ability as a rookie filmmaker were put to rest with his aforementioned debut due in large part to his mastery of the cinematic style and narrative substance of Christopher Isherwood's novel of the same name. Ford's direction not only brought a photographic sheen to a substantive story with compelling characters, it produced excellent performances especially from Colin Firth who received his very first Academy Award nomination for his role as George Falconer. In the rare stunning debut that was A Single Man, Ford's future in cinema following the release of the film was a future of interest.7 years later, Ford returns with Nocturnal Animals, an adaptation of Austin Wright's 1993 novel Tony and Susan. The premise surrounds Susan Morrow (Amy Adams), a disenchanted wealthy artist living in the fallout of a fading marriage, a deteriorated family/social life and a unfulfilling career. Amy Adams portrays the insecurities, regret and inner failings of Susan while moving past her ""nice girl"" typecast (i.e.: Catch Me If You Can, Doubt) in favor of the dark, more complex roles she has diversified herself in more recent years (The Fighter, American Hustle). In doing so, Susan becomes a vessel for a jaded audience who made the smart decision only to long for the more exciting ones. Susan effectively is a person who chose pragmatic cynicism over hopeful optimism, and has come to regret the various decisions she has made on such a basis, which are no doubt ideas fostered by her elitist, domineering mother (played strongly by Laura Linney).Susan's life is the narrative frame in which the film is set. This frame opens with an artistic collage of unsightly nudity that is Susan's allusion to the repellent, junky excess of American sexual freedom and superficial accessory. Coming home to her distant, apathetic husband Hutton (Armie Hammer), it becomes clear that Susan's marriage is in shambles, waiting for the final crack of Hutton's infidelities. Unexpectedly, Susan is sent a manuscript from her estranged ex-husband Tony Hastings (Jake Gyllenhaal) titled ""Nocturnal Animals,"" which was also a pet name he gave to her. Susan begins to read the novel, which centers around Edward, a sheepish father (also portrayed by Gyllenhaal), who after a roadside scuffle with three troublemaker criminals (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Karl Glusman and Robert Aramayo), engages in a confrontation that ends in the rape and murder of his wife and daughter. An emotionally broken, and consistently edgy Edward is guided by Detective Bobby Andes (played by the humorously dry yet severe Michael Shannon), an unconventional and bitterly sullen cop at the end of his rope, devoted to pursuing the men responsible.The narrative of the film cuts in between Susan's life, her reading of the novel and flashbacks exploring the circumstances of her relationship with Tony, which is characterized by the dichotomy of Susan's battle with ""realistic"" cynicism and dreamy optimism. Her choice of the former leads her to commit an act of betrayal that form the basis of her failed marriage with Hutton and initially unbeknownst to Susan, the basis of Tony's novel. Ford's narrative approach carefully layers the dynamics of novel fantasy, and past and present reality. In doing so, Nocturnal Animals becomes an allegorical revenge tale that uses riveting Hitchcockian tropes, found in the film's story-within-a-story depiction, to heighten the audience's thirst for thrills while the true story falls within the reality of Tony's intentions of sending Susan a copy. The ending makes Edward's intentions perfectly clear: to show Susan that his artistic success and his indifference to the failures of her own is the revenge he is serving coldly to her as sits alone, waiting with the unfulfilled anticipation of a dinner with him.As with Ford's previous drama, the story is striking just for its dramatic tensions and presented in a unique yet purposeful manner. Stylistically, Seamus McGarvey's cinematography brings out the lush beauty of the superficial, the cold hollowness of the unbridled capitalistic ambition, the dark emptiness of a lonely surroundings and the brooding, foreboding harsh realities of the American west. The film is weaved together with exacting precision by Joan Sobel, and scored delectably by Abel Korzeniowski. The performances are all quite above par including Jake Gyllenhaal's pained repression, Amy Adams' silent inner emptiness, Michael Shannon's moroseness, Laura Linney's snobbish conceit and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's psychopathic madness. With everything exactly in its right place, Tom Ford has created an unforgettable neo-noir thriller worthy of the tradition of Hitchcock, Polanski, Lynch and the Coens, not to mention a step forward for himself. Despite setting a high bar with his previous debut, Ford rises to the occasion in greater fashion than before."
" ""...our world is a lot less painful than the real world.""
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,8,"As the story within a story concept plays out, we learn that Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) relives a former relationship which in her own mind, she ended miserably and with little compassion for her ex-husband. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays the ex, Edward Sheffield, along with a character in the book written by him. The fictional story, titled ""Nocturnal Animals"", progresses along the lines of a Stephen King novel or screenplay, and contains levels of violence that often brings Susan out of her reverie long enough to have her reflect mournfully on her past and the guilt that goes along with it. You come to realize that his novel was Sheffield's form of revenge after his emotions festered over the course of two decades for not only the sudden breakup, but for the callous abortion Susan had that ended her association with him. In a way, the fictional story almost overwhelms the here and now of Susan's recollections because of it's graphic violence and the perversity of the characters that drive the fictional Hastings family off the road and initiate a night filled with terror. The novel's introduction of a dying police detective (Michael Shannon) raises the revenge stakes up a notch for Hastings, in turn symbolizing Edward Sheffield's determination to make Susan Morrow suffer for an unrequited past. The entire picture is very well done, with the transitions between the present, the past and the situations in the book's narrative occurring seamlessly enough that one doesn't get confused if you're paying attention. The only downside if there has to be one, was that gruesome opening with the naked fat ladies, but now that I mention it, you'll probably want to see it for yourself."
" Superb
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,9,"This is seriously good. Brilliantly acted. Great script. Amy Adams - maybe she's a genius. She's never less than great but her performance here is... well, watch it and see for yourself."
" Deep. Haunting. You can't explain why you would like this!
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,8,"You wouldn't be able to explain why this film would grab your attention but one thing is for sure, this is gonna stay with you For a while and the plot is one of a kind! Tom ford has achieved an enigmatic experience that definitely stands out! Jake and Amy are everything!"
" Pretentious, overwrought leftist tripe
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,1,"Self-absorbed characters who are exceedingly unlikable showing the rest of us how contrived, boring and depressing their lives are. Every character not deemed to be a leftist is an extreme caricature. This movie failed on so many levels. I couldn't make it all the way through it. Pretentious tripe."
" Best ive seen in years
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,10,Since the pandemic hit ive found myself going backwards in years watching movies i have never seen from the past and finding a lot of hidden gems this movie was amazing the plot was written perfect in every aspect highly reccomend it
" Blah
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,3,"Amy Adams reads a book. Dumb movie. Boring. Jake Gyllenhaal is an awful actor. Michael Shannon was the only thing worth seeing, but he couldn't save it."
" Tony is indeed a weak man.
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,7,The movie was good but tony was so incapable so weak and such a loser that I ended up disliking him. They were stopped by a car on the interstate and his wife and daughter were abducted by two men while the third guy made him drive into the desert and left him there alone and drove off. The next day they found the bodies of them. The officer with lung cancer offered him help when the two got released because the evidence wasn't sufficient. The officer was the best character in the film. They took them to a place of the officer and our loser let them escape. The officer shot one of them dead while the annoying one ray got away. Tony found him in the shed in the desert. He shot him but he could hit him back with an iron bar in the head. He woke up and walked outside and fell to the ground. He couldn't see and show himself. He replied to the mail of the woman who left him for a handsome guy and said he'd want to meet her. She waited for him the entire evening at the restaurant but he didn't show up. The first half of the movie was excellent as the scene on the highway was extremely tense and scary. The woman reading the novel as we see what he read throughout the whole movie was nice but nothing extraordinary. Then Tony couldn't stop being an extremely weak man and this started to get on my nerves and I started to dislike the movie as he was the protagonist. Overall it was a nice watch and I really like Michael Shannon and his character in this film.
" Dark, disturbing and powerful
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,9,"''May you never feel such despair or guilt'' is what I wish you after having watched the movie. Especially the part with the guilt.''Nocturnal Animals'' is both a wreakful, vindictive fantasy, a requiem for those who were wronged and a wake-up call for the wrongdoers who have never grasped the consequences of their deeds. The film possesses a dark, depressing, gripping beauty in its imagery. Hues of red, a melancholic blue, the blackness of darkness and a blinding light dominate the mournful dessert and the exuberant, yet cold and lonely house of the protagonist. It is an excellently well-crafted atmosphere of remorse.I haven't read Austin Wright's novel, unhappily, but the movie surprised me. I didn't know where everything was going to go in the beginning, later on some threads seemed a bit too entangled and perhaps some of the dialogue could have been bettered BUT... what was good, was good. Jake Gyllenhaal's acting was priceless, it should be taken as an example for one of the greatest displays of rage and wrath seen in the cinema of the 21st century (along with his mirror scene in ''Nightcrawler''). Amy Adams also felt the right choice, I saw her in The Master and Arrival and she has one of those unique ''sad eyes'' that I held in high regard. The soundtrack is a treasure, thanks Abel Korzeniowski, Serge Gainsbourg and Giles Edward Palmer. The critique of our materialistic society is pretty obvious. However, I was in the right mood for something more straightforward. The originality of the story also exists mostly due to the book but still, great idea to adapt this philosophically-packed story to the screen for those of us who have time to read but always find pretexts not to.9,40 out of 10 from me."
" Thriller about a story inside of a story
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,8,"Jake Gyllenhaal plays two roles: Tony Hastings (character in a novel) and Edward Sheffield (the author of the novel). No, I haven't run into this twist either. Nocturnal Animals, the title of his novel, is about a gang of thugs that terrorize a family on a Texas highway at night. Shelfield's ex-wife Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) is sent the novel to read by him prerelease to read. She revisits their lives together as she reads the novel, which is played out on-screen. The acting is good by all concerned, especially Gyllenhaal. The introductory credit roll, however, is one of the grossest things I've seen and we almost quit watching before the movie started (it does have a link to the ex-wife, but it could have been done more tastefully with little effort)."
" Don't waste your time
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,1,"My daughter recommended this, wish she hadn't as i was getting really frustrated watching this rubbish after 30mins so i decided to come here and read the one star reviews. I definitely won't be watching the next 1hr 20mins of this garbage. Never have i seen a movie for the first 30mins that gets more and more stupid and dumber by the minute. That's the reason i tend to steer clear of Yank movie because they are awful and badly written just like this was. I'll stick to South Korean movies."
" Ford introduces a unique way of communicating a relationship.
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,9,"I couldn't believe Tom Ford, as in fashion designer Tom Ford, made this film. Never would I have thought he would make movies but now I hope he makes more in the future.Nocturnal Animals follows Susan, a wealthy art gallery owner, who receives her ex-husband's new novel titled 'Nocturnal Animals'. As she begins reading it, she notices the similarities between the novel and their relationship.Nocturnal Animals is one of the more interesting dramas I've seen in a while. It's been a few weeks since I've seen it and have been thinking about it ever since. The film is based on a novel and is essentially three stories in one that all relate to each other in conveying the relationship between Susan and her ex-husband. What Tom Ford has pulled off here is terrific. There are many subtle hints and symbolism hidden throughout to link each of the stories in order to get the full picture of the relationship between these two. There are a couple moments where Ford literally spells out the themes which I didn't like but apart from that I think the rest of the film is fantastic. This is a very unique way of communicating a relationship to the audience and I feel, with each rewatch, there will more clues to pick up on in order to grasp the personalities and feelings of these characters. The film looks gorgeous and the camerawork is excellent all the way through. There are some well executed moments of tension where each actor gives it their all.Jake Gyllenhaal gives a strong and emotional performance. There is so much emotional range required for his role and he conveys it beautifully. Amy Adams is great in every single film I've seen with her in it and she's really good here as well. A lot of feelings are conveyed by her eyes and expressions which say so much about her character. Michael Shannon is awesome here. Not only is his character entertaining to watch but Shannon plays it incredibly well. Aaron Taylor-Johnson gives his best performance here in my opinion. He conveys the disgusting and vile nature of Ray Marcus brilliantly. There are countless scenes where he well and truly shines.Nocturnal Animals has been on my mind for quite some time now. The amazing acting, brilliant direction from Tom Ford, the story and the characters involved make Nocturnal Animals a thought-provoking watch that I feel will only get better on multiple viewings."
" Just fantastic
",2021-02-25 00:00:00,9,"Such amazing style. I mean, of course, it's Tom Ford. He's made 2 absolutely stunning, beautiful, emotional films."
" Gritty and gratifying
",2021-02-25 00:00:00,8,"You'll love it. If you don't it's because you've not lived through enough life to have someone completely screw you over in love and spent 20 years never getting over it. It's all there, listen to the dialog. It's all there. This film is fantastic, it's cathartic and karmic."
" Just one question ?

",2021-02-20 00:00:00,8,"As things go south on Jake's character you find yourself asking when or if you would make your move, a credit to the story, direction and Jake's performance. Any Adams is mesmerizing and Michael Shannon unforgettable. Add in the great visuals and you've got a memorable film journey - thanks!"
" Slow start but worth the wait
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,8,"The beginning is a bit strange and slow, and it might turn you off from watching the movie. But trust me- it's worth the enduring the beginning. The movie gets super interesting and intense, I couldn't turn my head away. Definitely worth a watch."
" A film that makes you think.
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,6,"At first viewing of this film. I was a bit confused, in the ending. I felt like I wanted more and was surprised to see it end. After understanding the ending, I really enjoy this film. As Gyllenhaal novel is about how he feels. How is ex took his family away from him. Now he gets his revenge on her at the end."

Now I've even doubts that I get it the first time. But great movie. Justice should be more like that. To many people getting a way with bad things.
" Boring and predictable
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,1,"Would not recommend this movie. I want these 2 hours back. Super disappointed as the reviews were quite positive about this movie. What was less that 2 hours felt like 3 , only watch it if you have trouble sleeping!!"

Bad acting, unrealistic moves from all acting people. Unrealistic events do occur.Heavily overrated production."
" Horrible
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,2,"Alright watched this movie, complete trash. Rotten tomatoes gives this move like a 80 but Step Brothers a 60. Everyone in the comment tryna explain this thing like it's a poem. It's not that deep homies, this film is like the movie inception but that only part relating to inception is that like Leo, we have no idea what the hell is going on during the whole movie. Pack of boring balding flounder looking jagaloons make these ratings, I'd rather watch the opening scene with the whales dancing for 2 hours then have to sit through this eye sore. Also Tom Ford, go get so rehab you Dave matthews looking fraud."

",2021-01-30 00:00:00,5,"Each scene is done with very detailed even every hair. Lovely done acting is very good do not know who can do it better. Beautifully done, only pity about the story could be so much more but like that the main actress is getting back by in an indirect punch"

Just all around average."

" The Morally Bereft:. Seekers of Status and Wealth
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,10,"""Nocturnal Animals,"" (2026). Starring Amy Adams, Jake Gyllendaal, and Michael Shannon. Directed by Tom Ford (screenplay). From the novel by Austin Wright.
This film's theme is morality and the lack of it in our daily lives. I forget where exactly I learned this, probably in an Anthropology class, but reiterated in an English class by a professor who believed that the most common motivating drive in the human being was sex. The other innate drives were survival (food, shelter), status, wealth, and power. This particular story is about women and a desire for status and wealth. The protagonist in NA is Susan Morrow, a wealthy art dealer. She is smart enough to detect her mother's weakness for the security of wealth and status and her compromises to attain it. But Susan does not have the convictions of her beliefs. She succumbs to taking the easy way to achieve her goals, a hallmark of wealthy people who adjust their morals to suit their ends. So what we have is a person who is a nocturnal animal who hides her motives in darkness, definitely not a mark of true class. The other characters are nocturnal predators who have no qualms about their actions or limits to them and their crassness. So we have an interlacement of the adminatio device of class/crass. The difference between the wealthy morally bereft and the lower class is the openness of action. When Susan ditches her high classed partner, she slashes his ego unmercifully. She even goes so far as to betray her own womanhood by aborting his child because of its inconvenience. She later slashes her new lover's ego when he's having financial problems. She's like a flea, jumping from a drowning dog to a floating log after log, to put it crassly. Ray ditches her but doesn't tell her why. Edward/Tony does tell her, in so many words. He gives her a chance to let his lesson sink in. But it is too late, as he warned her before their breakup. The imagery of lewdness and crassness is contrasted with the discernment, discretion, and sensitivity of class throughout the film. The relationship between Tony and Bobby is a mirror image of men who are morally and psychologically alike. And who find a way to bring about justice and moral cognizance.
This film is important and reaffirms the necessity of living by a strict moral code, giving up vanity in our daily lives.
This film hit all the marks for an excellent film. I give it 5 stars. It's on Amazon Prime. Enjoy!"
" Outstanding movie making
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,10,"I watched it again and was pleasantly surprised to find I liked it even more than the first time, knowing what the story was ultimately about.
It has so many elements going for it - thrilling suspense, haunting music, incredible production values for all cast and crew. And above all, I found it heartbreaking about lost love and lost ideals.
Do not miss this film."
" Thinking & Thinking & Thinking
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,8,"Brilliant performances from Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Michael Shannon in a revenge story told differently that will keep you thinking and thinking and thinking."
" WARNING SKIP FIRST FIVE MINUTES
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,7,"Seriously? Dancing, naked, obese, old women for FIVE MINUTES. I get it, they're artsy, trying to make the viewer uncomfortable, so now we understand just how foofoo, hoity-toity Susan's high-class art gallery is.... but I have avoided seeing my grandmother naked and will never be woke enough to take a peak. I'll wait until my wife and I get really old before addressing theses issues and don't need movies to do it for me prematurely.That said, it's a pretty engaging movie, emotionally stirring. I actually liked the ending, I predicted it, said to my wife ""he should stand her up"". Maybe it leaves a bit of an unsatisfying feeling, since I'm used to a resolution tied up with a bow. I don't agree with the reviews that defend Susan's decisions. I think this is an indictment of her weakness in leaving Edward and becoming her mother.It was worth the watch. Except for naked grandma."
" ""Believe me, our world is a lot less painful than the real world.""
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,9,"Nocturnal Animals is able to present itself as a total unique viewing of masterful storytelling, containing fantastic performances, but leading to a rather satisfying conclusion. I was looking forward to watching this film for quite a while now, and I have to say, after watching it, it is nothing like I expected it to be. The film does a surprisingly decent job at balancing the three stories at hand, that being the present events in Adam's characters life, the past events, and the story her ex-husband wrote for her. Without a doubt the best parts of the movie involve the story at hand throughout the film, parts lead largely by a fantastic-as-ever Jake Gyllenhaal and the underrated Michael Shannon. Aaron Taylor-Johnson also provides an excellent although downright despicable performance as Ray Marcus, as well as Amy Adams who also does her best in her often solemn-filled role. The film can be a bit hard to follow at times, lacking a true point in the end for the audience, and building up to something that clearly was never there. My biggest part of the film was the ending, not because it was bad, but just because it felt unfinished. I get what director Tom Ford was going for, but it just doesn't feel right given the context of things at hand, and I wish there was a more forthright conclusion in at least some way for the audience and myself to enjoy. The film is never predictable, but it does have a few cliche character moments throughout, although Ford's script manages to give a greater depth to this and largely is able to overcome its more generic flaws. In the end, Nocturnal Animals isn't what I expected it to be, but it is a very well done thriller with issues, but never enough to disappoint too much.
My Rating: 8.6/10"
" Absolutely brilliant
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,8,For me jake gyllenhaal was the standout so it confuses me how Michael Shannon got an Oscar nominee and he didn't. I'm not saying Michael Shannon was bad it's just Jake gyllenhaal was better. I didn't know what to expect from the film but I was pleasantly surprised. Great acting on display.
" Excellent thriller
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,10,Excellent thriller with Jake Guillen Hall Amy Adams I would highly recommend us one to anybody who likes edge of your seat type thriller
" Wow what a movie!
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,9,"Honestly, one of the best movies I've seen in years! That beginning scene though.... just skip it. It's weird and awkward and stupid. Just skip the beginning scene and this movie is a masterpiece."
" Was for a time the best movie ever made
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,10,"I look for the best interpretation, out of the inverse of God waiting for the pop. It could be the pop that doesn't wait for God. It could be God not waiting to the non-pop.Somehow, the second interpretation is the one I might find resonance in. Not solace. But resonance."
" Bad wannebe drama with a bad story intertwined.
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,5,Write a better story than the standard my phone doesn't work because we are to far from any hick town in the USA. To standard storytelling no dept in the characters and everything goes downhill after that.
" Nocturnal Animals
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,7,"Nocturnal Animals is a stylistic thriller that tries to woo its audience with a story deeper than first meets the eye. While the styling, at times, feels a little overdone, the result is a film that, if nothing else, looks stunning. Thankfully, there is a lot to like in addition to the visuals.Now, while there is a lot to like in Nocturnal Animals, it is also filled with questionable choices. As such, it has been hard to decide how I feel about it. One of its strengths, certainly, is the way it looks. With plenty of long and meandering shots that all look great, the film manages to pull off an almost calming feel, despite its story. Indeed, a lot of the film tends to veer towards style over substance, and at times, it leads to an unfulfilling and anticlimactic feel. However, even with its flaws, the story is quite engaging. And it's not the story itself that is the problem, it's primarily the way it's told. The big thing in Nocturnal Animals, and what it does to set itself apart, is creating two separate stories that intertwine. However, while it is a great concept, the problem here is that the two stories don't really add anything to one another. They are two different tales, happening at seemingly two different times, to two different groups of people. While it is clear that each story is supposed to add weight to the other, the resulting product caused me to lose interest in both.The story, which after given some thought, is certainly deeper than first meets the eye, never quite has the impact it clearly attempts to reach. It follows Susan, an artist who is in an unhappy marriage, as she receives a book draft from an ex-husband. As she delves into the book, we get to witness the characters and story of it through what is essentially a movie in a movie. The book follows Tony, who loses his wife and daughter to an atrocious act of violence. As he goes on a quest for revenge, it becomes clearer and clearer that both stories parallel each other in more than one way. And as Susan falls in love with Edward, his ex-husband, again, he ends up getting the revenge that he was looking for after their relationship ended.
The summary I wrote, doesn't even begin to accurately portray the story, with all its subtleties, and parallelisms. While the story in the book is a fairly simple revenge thriller, and the story taking place outside the book an even simpler story of lost love, the way the combine as one in creating the overarching story that is Nocturnal Animals, is quite interesting. If you were to watch this movie without giving it your full attention, I'd guess that it would be very unimpactful. However, once you get into it, and really pay attention to everything that is happening, the subtle hints and nods from the book's story into the history between Susan and Edward, make for a surprisingly good experience.However, while the two stories create an intricate and exciting web that the viewer has to navigate through to find any depth in the film, I ended up feeling dissatisfied. I found myself constantly looking for a deeper connection between the two stories, and unfortunately, I never found it. On the surface, Nocturnal Animals feels rudimentary, and unless you are willing to spend time thinking about it, it will say that way. And unless I knew that I was going to write a review about it, I doubt that I would've spent any time thinking about what I saw. Although I have recently learned to love movies that force me to think about them to find a deeper and more meaningful message, the film has to be intriguing enough, even at its most surface level, to make me spend the time. Nocturnal Animals, unfortunately, never quite reaches the level of excitement and interest that would've made me eager to spend more time with it.All in all, though, Nocturnal Animals is an intense thriller that offers new ideas and gorgeous visuals, despite feeling overly stylized at times. I was pleasantly surprised by the chances it took, and if nothing else, this film can never be described as safe. While it doesn't quite hit the nail on the head with its execution, the final product is intriguing and exciting enough to make for a good and thought-provoking film that kept me engaged from start to finish."

" Coen bros meet David Lynch & Roman Polanski
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,8,"A compelling story (from a novel 'Tony and Susan' by Austin Wright) rendered deftly by an unappreciated film maker. Genuine suspense with jarring twists and turns that follows no formula, ie, it is o r i g i n a l : in its conception and execution. The imagery, both actual and metaphorically is surreal and raw at the same time. The acting and direction is of the highest caliber. This film is without doubt the best one I have seen in the last year : truly a masterpiece that I believe has gone unrecognized for reasons I could not speculate about. It is eerie , chilling and emotionally draining; isn't that what good film making should be? Provocative, dramatic, you will be engaged throughout . Highly recommended."

" Michael Shannon gives a truly Oscar worthy performance
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,9,"I came here specifically to tell people that Michael Shannon's performance was some of the best acting I have seen and it was Oscar worthy - so I was pleasantly surprised to find that he WAS nominated for one. The beginning scene is immediately arresting and it will instantly pique your interest in the movie. Most people feel it is sheer shock value but it has purpose in defining who Susan is as a person. This movie is good. I wouldn't call it spectacular or a masterpiece, but it is a entertaining movie that kept my attention."
" Hollywood's view of west Texas
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,5,The idea that either party in this atrocity/revenge flick that was situated in West Texas would not have any firearms is a ridiculous fantasy. Just a poorly written but well acted movie. All three leading actors are outstanding and saved this terrible screen play.
" A Masterpiece
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,10,"Nocturnal Animals is an almost perfect example of a psychological thriller done right. This is one of those movies that pulls at your heartstrings and it doesnt let them go. It has guts and emotion, and explores very sensitive and serious themes like love, revenge and regret. When I found out that Tom Ford directed this movie, I was even more amazed. This guy is a fashion designer and he really put many lifelong directors to shame with this movie, atleast in the way I see it. The intensity and tension in this movie is hard to match, I felt genuine dread and I was constantly on the edge of my seat. Jake Gyllenhaal, to nobodies surprise, delivers yet again. His display of grief and rage is pretty much unparalelled among his peers. Amy Adams is stunning in every meaning of the word and does an absolutely fantastic job in her role of Susan Morrow. I would also point out Michael Shannons very raw approach to portraying a police officer, and I always love to see more of him. I felt a very unusual connection with the character of Edward/Tony which is hard to describe. Without getting into any spoilers, I guess you can say we have similar character traits.A fair warning that some scenes are downright sickening, so if you are sensitive, you should watch out.Great pacing and structure, a wonderful cast and a very nice ending to boot. I went into this movie with high expectations, and it went above and beyond. You gotta check this out, I cannot imagine that this could be considered a waste of time under any circumstances."

" Interesting
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,6,"The director said the ending was shaped to be subjective and interpreted by the viewer.
Most interpretations I've seen swing one way or the other: either Edward stood Susan up because he had finally overcome his ""weakness"" and didn't need her anymore, or Edward actually killed himself because of the devastation of their relationship.
I think the (albeit subjective) truth comes more from his narrative. Probably the most gripping scene was Tony's meltdown after Lou was shot and Ray got away. Bobby turns to Tony confused as to why he wasn't satisfied with Lou's death and probably more confused as to why Tony hadn't shot both of them when he had the chance. Bobby even said to him, ""You know I had to shoot him right?"" In response, Tony screamed, ""I'm glad he's dead... (falls to his knees, cries, and screams) I should have stopped it.""
I think this is the clearest picture we get of Edward's true turmoil.
There are clear parallels between Edward and Tony's stories. The most significant is that both lose their wife and child. Tony's family dies by battery and Edward's family dies by abortion and (symbolically) divorce. The director makes it plainly obvious by the piece of artwork that stops Susan in her tracks towards the end of the film, this is a revenge story. In the novel, Tony is at first passive with his revenge on the victimizers, letting Bobby kill the first one. This is reminiscent of his 19 years of silence. Then he finds confidence and fights Ray which eventually kills him. And I think this is the parallel for the final scene. Edward finds confidence to write a novel which he uses to vengefully torment Susan. And even though it seems like it could have reconnected the previously married couple, it divides them and leaves Edward to die. Whether he committed suicide or continued living his life until he died of old age, it shows how he and Susan are completely divorced from their entire world. Edward has no wife and no children. Susan has neither first or second husband and her relationship to her mother and daughter are both shaky at best.
I think Edward's biggest source of pain comes from the line, ""I should have stopped it."" I think he partially blames himself for not being able to stop the abortion. Maybe if he had fought longer for their marriage, they would have got the news of pregnancy together and Susan would not have gone through with it. It's a bit of a darker perspective but it's the parallel I see from the novel.
Either way, it was an interesting movie."
" Jilted lover's fantasy
",2020-11-13 00:00:00,3,"Tom Ford's ""Nocturnal Animals"" is the cinematic telling of a broken-heart's fantasy of: ""He/she will regret this!"" as to their former partner's unilateral break-up of their relationship.Nearly two decades prior to the start of the film, ""Susan Morrow"" (Amy Adams) dumped her ineffectual, wannabe novelist, first husband ""Edward"" (Jake Gyllenhaal) in brutal fashion. She chose her much more ambitious, successful and Ken-doll handsome lover ""Hutton"" (Armie Hammer) over Edward. Plus, to make a clear-cut finish, she with Hutton's support aborted Edward's child. The only reason she gave Edward for destroying him: ""I am unhappy."" (How many marriages/relationships have been ended by those three words?)Now married to the once super-successful Hutton, Susan is even unhappier. Despite appearances, both her marriage and financial security are on shaky grounds. Feeling neglected and lost, she is intrigued when she receives the manuscript of Edward's first novel which is also dedicated to her. Alone in her palatial modern home, she proceeds to read the manuscript and finds herself increasingly disturbed by its sadistic story which is seemingly a parable of her break-up with Edward.The supposed irony of ""Nocturnal Animals"" is that Susan, despite being the main character, is a villain. She's a horrible person who did something monstrous to a good man for selfish and frivolous reasons.The most telling scene is a flashback featuring a cameo by Laura Linney playing Susan's Hollywood stereotype of a Republican country-club dowager mother. Dressed in true Stepford Wife fashion, Susan's mother warned her not to marry Edward. Susan was appalled by this especially when her mother described Edward as ""too weak"" for her. As we learn, though, the mother was correct and that she, not Susan, had Edward's best interests at heart. Knowing her daughter, she knew that Susan would eventually tire of Edward and turn on him. She also knew that Edward would be destroyed by that betrayal. We're supposed to be surprised that Susan is the antagonist and that her mother, despite the trappings of being a rich, stuck-up B, is one of the film's few ""good guys.""So, why three stars? I thought this was terrifically acted especially by the magnificent Mr. Gyllenhaal who has dual roles as both the hapless Edward and the main character of his novel. I was also amused by the casting of Isla Fisher as the wife character in the novel because we're supposed to initially see her as a stand-in for Susan. It's funny because Ms. Fisher admits that she is often mistaken for Amy Adams due to their close physical resemblance. However, I didn't like the movie.I found it sadistic especially the disturbing recreation of Edward's novel. Yes, it's meant to make the viewer uncomfortable, but I resented it. Plus, west Texas rednecks as the bad guys? Really? Why didn't they just set it in northern Georgia with ""Deliverance's"" ""squeal like a pig"" rednecks? Plus, the cinematic pretensions especially the opening and ending scenes are eye-rolling.I also didn't like it because it hit a bit too close to home. I had my own ""Susan"" and, like many, have been on the receiving end of: ""I am unhappy."" One would think that I'd enjoy a revenge fantasy of a jilted lover coming true, but that's just it: it isn't true. It's a movie. A fantasy. An artsy melodrama. And not a satisfactory one at that. Just arthouse, cinematic pretentions wrapped-up in Hollywood smugness."
" this movie is dumb (and i understand the ""art"" of it)
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,1,"I checked some 10 star reviews.
""oh the xxxxx is so amazing! best movie ever!""
""it's so deep! so much meaning! wow!""i feel the need to counter this :)
what is the actual plot like? (spoiler free)
1) a cliché relationship drama on one level, nothing special to see here. could have been a soap opera episode. sure, it's a different style, the setting is unusual, but only on a superficial or ""artsy"" level. the exact setup adds nothing to the plot. the little details (the main characters sleeping habits for example) don't lead anywhere. many elements could be removed and nothing would change.
2) on the second level, a crime takes place and someone takes revenge. there is no depth to the characters with a single exception. the scenario doesn't make sense, nobody would act like the characters did here. they simply cannot exist in the real world as they are portrayed in the movie.
there is nothing interesting, no twist, no surprise. everything is exactly what it seemed to be. none of them has a backstory (except one). they all just exist and follow the script so that the plot can happen."
" A Stylish Gem Crafted Oh So Beautifully
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,8,"Nocturnal Animals is a one of a kind cinematic experience. This misguidedly reviewed piece of art is composed of two dramatic and thrilling stories blended in mesmerizing fashion. The photography/cinematography was great and the performances across the board were emphatic from Michael Shannon to Jake Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams. This is a film that emotionally resonates, maybe due to its powerful and emotionally captivating performances and atmospheric undertone, but also its writing and direction was excellent and developed masterfully. Don't listen to the reviews! Besides this one."
" Not recommended if you have PTSD
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,6,"Due to my PTSD, it took me a few days for my head to process this movie. But the main reason I watched the movie was because Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Jake Gyllenhaal are some of my favourite actors.As much as I know how fictional the acting is, this is defiantly one of the most messed up movies I've ever seen, so messed up I can probably never watch it again -- similar to beautifully disturbing movies such as 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'American History X.' But at the same time lots of effort and time was put into the movie to the point it was so well done along with the amazing acting. But if you are going to watch it, you might want to skip some of the scenes in the beginning.The reason I have it rated so low is because it triggered my PTSD considering I've lived through some relatively similar events within this movie and have known many psychopaths in my lifetime -- even if I was an actor, I can honestly play one in a movie perfectly that I've been around them so much and can tell who is or isn't one. But I will say, Aaron Taylor-Johnson did an excellent job portraying a Psychopath. But I believe he didn't win an Oscar because his role was too controversial in this movie, but I believe one day he should and will win one."

",2020-10-04 00:00:00,3,"Spoilers
From the pointless opening credits sequence, started to regret spending time to watch the film.There was tension and some interest with the story within a story unfolding, but we got Laura Linney as a tired and unoriginal cliché portrayal of the Texas mother being a Republican Christian bigot disowning her gay son, and Isla Fischer unlikeable the entire cold, never stopped depressing rest of the film.The ending was absolutely pointless. I'd heard bad things about the film, but pushed ahead with an open mind. The acting was good, but the story total garbage in the end.Take a pass or expect to leave completely unsatisfied."
" Gyllenhaal again mesmerizes!! Amy Adam's as well, phenomenal!!
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,9,"Cant say enough about how amazing Jake Gyllenhaal is, I've never seen a bad performance or a mediocre f ok r that matter. If hes in the movie expect a phenomenal performance. He should have a couple of Oscars by now but then again I still dont know how their process works, because its rarely the right outcome in any if the categories or actors/actresses. Nightcrawler was an oscar performance without question but I dont think he even got nominated. Amy Adam's performance is subdued and it needed to be , and unlike a Christopher nolan movie I understood this movie. It most definitely is a must see!!!! Hats off to an extremely entertaining movie, oh and Michael shannon is again phenomenal!!!!"

" Extremely well-written screenplay.
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,8,"Gyllenhaal and Adams both perform well in this film, pull their weight, and provide emotional resonance for the suspense of the film.This is a well-executed original concept, and you will certainly wonder where the plot of the film is going. The utilization of various stories offers a fascinating conclusion when you understand the link between all of the plot lines seen in the film.However, where this film is most effective for me is in its screenplay. The proposed idea was fleshed out and thought-provoking. Any casual members of the audience may not find the ending satisfactory, but I loved the implication of it. It suits the plot perfectly and makes for a powerful experience when you sit back to reflect on its importance.My main negative for the film would be the overall enjoyment one may get out of it. Despite it being well made, I cannot see myself going back to revisit it."
" Nocturnal Animals
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,8,"I recognised the poster when I looked up the title of the movie, I was attracted to watching it by the good cast, the plot, and the high praise by critics, from BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Tom Ford (A Single Man). Basically, Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) is a rich art gallery owner living in Los Angeles. She receives the manuscript for a novel written by her estranged ex-husband Edward Sheffield (BAFTA nominated Jake Gyllenhaal) along with an invitation for dinner while he is visiting. Susan is now married to unfaithful businessman Hutton Morrow (Armie Hammer), but she is upset that the marriage is deteriorating. Susan starts to read the novel, which is both dedicated to her and named Nocturnal Animals after Edward's nickname for her. She becomes consumed by the novel. In it, Tony Hastings (also Gyllenhaal) is a family man on vacation with his family, wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and daughter India (Ellie Bamber). Whilst driving at night through West Texas, they get entangled with three local troublemakers, Ray Marcus (Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Lou Bates (Karl Glusman), and Turk/Steve Adams (Robert Aramayo). After being forced off the road, Tony is powerless to stop Ray and Turk from kidnapping his wife and daughter, and leaving him with Lou, who forces him to drive Ray's car to the end of a road where he is abandoned. Tony manages to evade Ray and Lou when they return looking for him and makes his way to a nearby farmhouse to call the police. Detective Roberto ""Bobby"" Andes (Oscar nominated Michael Shannon) is assigned to the case. With Tony, they discover the bodies of Laura and India near an abandoned shack, they were raped and murdered. Tony is wracked with guilt. A year later, he is contacted by Andes and asked to identify Lou, who is charged as an accomplice in the murders of Laura and India. Shocked by the dark content and raw emotion of the novel, Susan reminisces about meeting Edward in college and their blossoming relationship. Susan's domineering mother Anne Sutton (Laura Linney) objected to the relationship, claiming that Edward was not worthy of Susan's affections and that he lacked the drive to achieve his goals; Susan ignored her mother and eventually married Edward. Back in the world of the novel, Turk has been fatally shot in a botched robbery, leaving Ray as the final culprit to be brought to justice. Andes arrests Ray, but due to lack of circumstantial evidence of his involvement, he is released. Andes is close to retirement and dying from terminal lung cancer, so with Tony's help, he takes matter into his own hands. They abduct Ray and Lou. Andes shoots Lou when he tries to escape, but Ray escapes. In the real world, Susan finds evidence of her husband's extramarital affair. She resumes reading the manuscript and recalls her troubled marriage to Edward. His fledgling career and her frustration and dismissive attitude of his literary aspirations caused the marriage to strain and culminated with Susan cheating on him with Hutton and divorcing Edward to marry him. Edward attempted to repair their relationship but stopped seeing Susan after learning that she was pregnant with his child but secretly had an abortion. Back in the novel, Tony is on his own and tracks down Ray to the shack where Laura and India were killed. Ray admits to raping and murdering Laura and India, calling him weak. Tony fatally shoots him but is blinded when Ray hits him on the head with an iron bar. Tony stumbles outside, succumbing to a brain haemorrhage, he dies, and accidentally shoots himself in the abdomen falling on his gun. In the present day, Susan finishes reading the novel and arranges a meeting with Edward at a restaurant. Edward does not show up, and Susan waits alone as all other diners leave. Also starring Andrea Riseborough as Alessia Holt, Michael Sheen as Carlos Holt, Alessia's homosexual husband, Zawe Ashton as Alex, Jena Malone as Sage Ross, and singer Beth Ditto as TV Woman #2. Adams, Gyllenhaal, Fisher, Shannon and Taylor-Johnson all give terrific performances, this one of those art house style films that shocks and surprises in equal matter, from the bizarre and controversial opening featuring obese women dancing naked in slow motion, to the violence of the novel seen through the lead character's imagination, it all adds up to an intriguing, interesting and fascinating psychological thriller. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Adapted Screenplay for Tom Ford, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Original Music for Abel Korzeniowski, and Best Make Up/Hair, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Very good!"
" A little long, but you wouldn't want to miss a second.
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,9,"Described as 'neo-noir', Nocturnal Animals is one of those films that's 'bigger' than us. That is, it is a production so meticulously put together, and exploring so deeply its own narrative, it isn't even satisfied to tell only one story: it tells three.It requires concentration to notice what is being told in present time, in flashback, and also the long moments taken from the book written by the character of Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) - these moments, it should be noted, are from the perspective of ex-wife Susan Morrow (Amy Adams). If any confusion does arise from this, it all clears up as time goes on, and the beautiful cinematic flourishes (Director and Producer Tom Ford has a reputation for rewarding those who watch closely) are a wonderful diversion.By being 'bigger' than us, I mean that every level of 'Nocturnal Animals' features people at the top of their game, from the utterly brilliant actors to the extraordinary production values, to Abel Korzeniowski's heart-rending musical score. By being 'bigger' than us, it doesn't even have to bother with closure for some of its characters - by the heart-breaking close, which is too open-ended for some, you wonder what happens to some of the characters you've become so heavily invested in. The film doesn't even have to rely on excessive gore or horror to make you despair for their fate."
" Totally useless waste of time.
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,1,"Seriously, what are the idiots thinking who rate this highly? The so-called 'Art' in it is absolutely awful and not Art in any way, shape or form.

Absolute rubbish, don't waste your time on this garbage."
" Another revenge
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,8,"I watched the movie on the plane and haven't any idea what it was all about. It ended up i addicted to it!. It is an interesting story that jumping among reality, memories and fictional content. Without having creepy ghost, it can successfully present a strong thrilling atmosphere that I feel scary. That's the powerful words of the novel, so the lead actor decides to use it as revenge tool.In the movie, we can see human nature is extremely complicated. No one is totally compromising to be good, at the same time, no one is totally an evil. Those who seem kind and gentle are not always willing to grin and bear it without being violence. In other words, Susan thinks that Tony, who is always willing to give in, is not true. All those suppressed emotion turns out to become violent voices that expressed through three villains' evil deeds."

You know what they will be going though. You know how their lives will end.I hate seeing women abused; women the victims of violence, especially random, brutal violence. That was it for me. I turned it off.It shook me up for days. Be very careful with this one.-----Amy's range is so spectacular. So much beautiful stuff. She and Christian Bale have such an AMAZING screen dynamic, especially THE HUSTLER; every scene, but especially the scene of them dancing.I hope they work together again."

This is a beautiful story of a bereaved man who writes down a perfect horrific, heart crunching story who is ready to do anything for his beloved wife who leaves him in lurch after finding a handsome man. He writes the novel for her, that depicts exact emotions that he has for his family (wife, and never happened daughter), and he finally wins the heart of his ex-wife which she always criticized his work, and he brings her to the table so emotionally through the novel just like us, and he finally never end up meeting her which she wished to meet her in the restaurant, showing he is no more for her just like the ending of the written novel.So, psychological beautiful movie. One has to understand the emotions of the characters to get into what is to be perceived. This is an emotionally connected movie, which is sad, but yet heart touching story of a bereaved man who is just nice to anyone.Loved it.. 10/10"
" So touching

I don't know why girls usually leave nice guys for being kind, sincere and loyal and call them boring and WEAK. They end a relationship with a nice guy in which real love do exist and go for jerks or rich men. They forget about their ex and don't care about him who will never be the same again.
Finally they are betrayed, by their husband and miss the real hugs and kisses they will never ever experience again in their entire life. They Miss the man who was ready to die for them. Miss the enless kindness and care.
In the end they regret and want to get back to what values the most in this world. Real love.

Gylenhaal gets assaulted, his wife and daughters abducted on the highway late one night in a truly terrifying ordeal at the hands of a bunch of rednecks. That's all way back in the past, but then he writes a book about it and sends it to his new partner (Amy Adams), who's supposed to be a fancy gallery owner somewhere, looks like New York (which presumably explains the bizarre opening credits of obese strippers, a bit of performance art?). The book freaks her out, she presuming he's being allegorical and trying to tell her something. Maybe I'm missing something but I just didn't see the point of all that, it didn't add anything. Otherwise it's a good, stylish thriller with good performances, especially the flinty sheriff whose determination to get his man takes him to some dark places."

",2020-07-03 00:00:00,7,"The film has 3 segments all revolving around Susan Morrow played by Amy Adams i.e. present time when she's married second time yet alone , The past when she met her first husband who was writer and she married him against all the odds and yet left him for the same reasons and the Novel part which is dedicated to her in the present time by her Ex-Husband which she's reading and connecting it with her past failed relationship, now I know its little complex when you're reading but when you'll see the movie you'll not find it confusing which is because of the fine visual and narrative skill of the director Tom Ford. Apart form good Narrative & Visual the film is also watch worthy for the performances by Amy Adams, Gyllenhall & Michael Shannon. Also there are some underwhelming aspects which I felt including the abrupt ending as no definitive end was given to all the three segments, many questions remained un-answered. The thriller part was predictive but still picturized beautifully with respect to the occurrence of the events and some watch worthy cinematography"
" Revenge
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,8,"The leitmotif of Nocturnal Animals was quite clear to me: revenge. I know films are often misunderstood or over-analyzed, but I think this interpretation might have a point. He (Edward played by Jack Gyllenhaal) never accepted being treated/viewed as a weak person by his now ex-wife (Susan played by Amy Adams), she indeed couldn't truly believe in him becoming a successful/prolific writer. What he did is really clear: he created a fictional family that resembles what they were before divorce and show through the novel what being truly weak means, and he did that by displaying a man totally unable to protect his wife and daughter, and who hasn't enough courage to revenge them. It's like the message of the novel was:""If you think I was weak, look at this man"" and he did that by writing a haunting novel. The scene when she drops her colleague's phone has a painting in the background with a writing: REVENGE, basically what drove him writing the book. In the end, I was quite surprised finding out this was written and directed by Tom Ford, I'd like to see more works like this one."
" An understated and subtle masterpiece of dramatic storytelling.
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,8,"This emotionally-charged film is novel and original, and will make you question everything about the world it shows the audience. I'm really not doing it justice when I say ""Animals"" takes you on the proverbial roller coaster; although that saying is trite, it's the quickest way to describe the feelings and emotions this film will inevitably calls up in the viewer. And what this movie will make you feel is damn near everything.The ""film within a film"" style done here is an integral part of the film and has never been done better - I'd describe the style (and only the style) as ""Pulp Fiction"" meets ""Total Recall"". But the knowledge we're watching a novel unfold for much of the story, does nothing to detract from the in-your-face power of the often harrowing events. The often dark and painful things the characters endure, often seem to compel the viewer to confront almost every emotion in existence, and I got the distinct feeling that this movie was trying to do exactly that: Disgust, sadness, empathy, revenge, rage, this film somehow touches them all.Despite the gritty subject matter, I enjoyed this film very much - it grabbed me right away and kept me absorbed right up to the ending (which I felt was unsatisfying at first, but I got over it - thanks to IMDB)."
" Great but gets boring quickly
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,6,"A wealthy art gallery owner is haunted by her ex-husband's novel, a violent thriller she interprets as a symbolic revenge tale.When you watch it remmber in 2 stories one inside the other, very deep story, the Movie directing, acting , storyline all amazing, but they pot the plot too quickly and then the movie just feels slow."
" Amateurish Exercise in Misogyny
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,1,"I used to admire Tom Ford for his work at Gucci. Not anymore. This disgusting, cheesy pile of rubbish should never have been bankrolled. The opening scene exploiting women is nothing but a harbinger of misogyny to come. Hollywood is disgusting. We all know that. Fortunately, people like Harvey Weinstein, Woody Allen, and Roman Polanski have already been exposed for the trash they are. Looking forward to when Tom Ford is. HBO should be ashamed for showing this heaping pile of manure. I won't watch anything with Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Armie Hammer, or Michael Sheen ever again."
" Hauntingly beautiful.
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,10,"I did have to watch this movie a couple of times, not least to overcome the quite horrific opening sequence. That said, what was initially (to me) a slightly confusing but fabulously portrayed story, I am now able to understand the respective tragedy between the characters in the book, and the symbolism therein in lives of Susan and Edward. It is quite brilliantly deployed. Tom Ford yes, Michael Shannon etc, all deservingly nodded for awards, but this has to be one of Jake G's finest performances, so why no accolades?
Big Theory Spoiler Alert. A very decent man loses his wife and child to the cruel intentions of another indecent man. Grief, remorse retold through a horrendous symbolic story that is understood and shared by Susan. So why didn't he turn up? The original Susan had already died."
" visually stunning & terrifying. Flawed storytelling
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,7,"It is always best if you do not read anything about a movie or watch any trailers and go right into it without any expectations. You will have an experience of a lifetime if the movie is well crafted. Though horrific and violent, cinematography is visually stunning and shot in style, quiet crafty to add. Events that occur in the course of time is depicted well with the use of darkness and color to explain the mood of a particular sequence or a scene. I felt a sense of apprehension and uneasiness when edward's wife and daughter are captured by nefarious bunch of crooks. It seemed very real and did not feel like edward was narrating it as part of his fictional novel. Narration lacked clarity and seemed flawed since the script tried to draw a comparison between the gruesome events that unfolded in fictional novel and the writer's pain endured due to failed relationship. It seemed completely unfair and imbalanced to create an analogy of a painful relationship with murder, rape of a teenage girl and her mother.
Acting was top notch as always from michael shannon, jake gyllenhal and amy adams. The ending scene when jakes character walks outdoor with blood smeared on his face after shooting his family's murderer seems distinctly similar to the climax sequence in the prisoners."
" This sort of movie is hard to rate!
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,8,"This movie really left us a strong message that materialism is not beyond anything. You might be rich, leading posh life, having servants, doing business but your love life is entirely null and void. I mean what's the point to lead a life when you've everything yet nothing! Amazing plot, different taste. Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon really played their best. Highly recommend to watch, kind of cliffhanger ending, will make your mind ambiguous, suspicious."
" An emotional movie
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,7,"It's all about vengence creativity and sorrow and the ending can be interpreted in so many ways , a good show"
" Engrossing
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,6,"A well scripted and acted suspenseful story with two plot lines converging into an unscripted finale. Jake Gyllenhaal, Amy Adams and Michael Shannon deserve kudos."
" Terrific terrifying (there's no such thing as very unique)
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,9,"Yes it's unique and it's captivating, but I think the English language has been watered down by the passage of time and in the passing of grammar buffs like my parent's (the greatest) generation. So no more describing something as very unique or so unique. Unique is an adjective describing a noun, and it's a word that stands alone. Something is either unique or it's not unique which means it's been seen before. There are no quantitative measures for uniqueness, no stages no charting. This is true. It's like saying someone's very pregnant but that's a bad example as it's also slang for about to give birth.. But I hope it resonates and that we can again respect the few words that deserve to stand alone. Like this movie."
" Could have been a classic, but failed in two main ways (no spoiler)
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,8,"Spoiler free as usual:
This is an incredibly slick movie which manages to ooze intimidation and fear in all the right places. It grabs you in the first 30 minutes and never lets you go.Sadly, it's not perfect, in fact the movie suffers from two main flaws:Firstly, the lead is miscast. At no point did i feel that Jake Gyllenhaal, action hero extraordinaire, was 'helpless' - when they could have easily cast another actor for that aspect of the role (lack of) physicality. In fact there are several shots were Jake is naked and looking like an Adonis demi-god, which severely detracts from the experience and the plot.Second, the movie is almost too slick for its own good. There's a 'detachment' that's felt from the saturated colors, the deep blacks and the cellulose feel of the flick. That's accentuated by how raw the film feels otherwise, down to the amazing, courageous ending by the director. What a shame - a movie never needed a 4k upconvert and remaster that badly.All and all, this is the movie that i'd have given a 10 to if they had gone all the way and ditched the hollywood glitz, but sadly with Clooney as exec that was never to be. Huge shame. 8/10 nonetheless because the screenplay and script carries it, alongside an enormous performance by Michael Shannon in the role of his career so far."
" started off great
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,4,"After the first 30 mins this film slowed down so much i thought my clocks were slow. could have been done and dusted in half the time. what about the ending? Snnnnooooooorrrrrreeeeee.Or did it go above my head. Boring and disappointing. No i would not recommend it. Pull your teeth out with pliers, much more entertaining."
" Makes no real sense
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,1,"I'm still trying to find some redeeming value in this movie. Alas, I cannot find any. Story made no real sense and was just downright annoying. No entertainment value, no awesome twist. I get that the dancing ladies in the beginning were part of ""her art"", but it also had nothing to provide the story. Cheating husband? Nothing to that story either. Maybe you could think that's why she was eyeing her ex-husband and had to read his book. Who knows. A man who almost acts indifferent with what happens to his wife and daughter. So unrealistic. I stayed watching in the hopes that something would make sense of this horrid movie. That never happened. If you're looking for a good movie stay away from this one. It's nowhere near worth your money or your time. It definitely doesn't deserve it's IMDb rating."
" Should have won an Oscar
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,10,It's just amazing. I am just upset it did not win an Oscar. No movie should have taken over in this category.
" Dark, gritty, well written, beautifully shot.
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,9,Wow. What a movie. I have a pair of Tom Ford shades but had no idea what an artist he truly was! Nocturnal Animals is dark and gritty. The acting is impeccable. Story was amazing. At first it a had a David Lynch vibe but takes on a life of its own once she starts reading the manuscript. The tense scenes felt tense which is a testament to Fords filmmaking. I can't wait to see he does next. 9/10 2👍🏻👍🏻
" Really bad movie.
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,8,"Damn..you lose it at the start but its like a book..the deeper you go the beteer it gets
But damnnnn"
" A must watch 💯
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Beautiful, Artistic, Subtlest story which makes it a unique one of a kind Classic
Ensemble cast with breathtaking performances.A must watch"
" Just ok for such a clever story
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,6,"This was just ok. A clever story within a story that ultimately falls short of being amazing or even all that memorable. I can't fault the performances of Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal or Michael Shannon who all did a fantastic job, this just failed to draw me in the way it should have.Its a violent & dark story about an art gallery owner who receives a manuscript/novel written by her ex-husband. She quickly becomes disturbed by the possibility that the story is inspired by their marriage and that her safety is in jeopardy. The story within the book then plays out in sort of a parallel timeline as Amy reads it. It soon becomes apparent that her ex is extracting some sort of revenge even if it might only be psychological. Weird ending."
" Thats great acting Gary!
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,7,"On a bit of a Jake binge, that led me here. You also cant go wrong with Amy Adams. Plus Jenna Malone if you are a fan of the amazing Neon Demon.The story revolves around a novel containing a fairly OTT crime, but one that leaves room for visually compelling scene-setups. I like how the novel unfolds over several years, and ties in with the regrets over the decisions that the Amy Adams character made over her life. The analogies between her loveless, vacuous and empty life and the novel are pretty apparent.This is a very compelling film with a very haunting ending. Well worth a watch. Its pretty tough viewing at times though"
" Contrived versus art
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,1,"I'm sorry to say that art loses this fight. Contrived, pretentious and stilted to name a few words. This movie isn't genuine and is trying to be artsy. Which is really bad because all the actors are good and do a great job. Michael Shannon knocked it out the park. And each story line is good on it's own but we're left wondering what they have to do with the other. We know what she's reading but aren't sure if this happened or is going to happen or if this is her worse nightmare. And then the end is forced to make you think because the director sure as hell didn't think what it means. The IMDB explains the plot more than the actually movie does.Of course with the nature of a pretentious movie like this people will misinterpret confusion with genius, based on the fact that they don't understand it therefore the filmmakers must be smarter than they are. This is of course not true. Just like a giant blockbuster is playing to their crowd so is this movie to the artsy crowd. It's the same way of thinking they just use different tools.Don't let lack of talent be misinterpreted as genius."
" Wtf
",2020-03-13 00:00:00,3,"Was he REALLY comparing a rape to an abortion????? And also, why do filmmakers feel like they need to put rape moments at basically any movie?? disgusting"
" I didn't like it because it didn't entertain me
",2020-03-11 00:00:00,2,"The story was nonsense and the plot was boring.
I've rarely seen such a bad movie."
" Half good half bad
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,5,The novel part was great but the everything else was pretty bad. Amy Adams was overly dramatic and this isn't one of Jake's best performances. I kinda hated the ending.
" Oh well, 2 hours of my life lost to self-important Hollywood drivel
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,2,"""Nocturnal Animals"" was a major let-down to me. I'm giving it two stars instead of one, because, much to my shame, I watched it to the end. Jake Gyllenhaal is rapidly becoming one of my least favorite actors, while serving as an excellent contrary indicator of how rewarding I'll find a particular film experience.I suppose the basic premise is interesting enough. It's a reasonably original take on a story within a story, but everybody in the movie (with the exception of the no-nonsense lawman) comes across as parodies of self-important ""creatives"". Under some circumstances this wouldn't be a problem, except that unfortunately in this case they weren't supposed to be parodies.This was meant to be a high-concept film offering a big statement about life. Something about the nature of ""love"" I think, but the biggest statement it actually made was that the Hollywood-types behind this ""work of art"" don't live in real world with the rest of us. I guess swimming in money, luxuriating in absurd creature comforts, and being surrounded by kowtowing sycophants has an insulating effect on people, not that I'll ever know. Thank god for my relative poverty I suppose.Also, making it all the worse, these poor, suffering, ""creatives"" care so much about everything that they're in mental anguish--although it's safe to say that they're not hurting nearly as much as I was after sitting through two hours of this self-indulgent drivel. So, if you're interested in a big-budget art film thriller meant to feel deep without any actual depth, look no further, but, otherwise, you might be better off with a Michael Bay production--admittedly a harsh indictment."
" Unique
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,10,"I can't really describe it. Unique is the one word that comes to my mind.
One of the best thrillers I have watched in the past few years.Anyone who appreciate film even a little bit needs to watch this one and experience it by themselves.A quick word about the acting: it is fantastic. But I expected that to be fair, Jake Gyllenhaal, Amy Adams are great as always. Michael Shannon truly shines, I always thought he is one of the most underrated actors out there. Surprised by Aaron Taylor and his performance, really good as well.Seriously, go watch it."
" Not as good as expected but solid
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,6,I think I had higher expectations on this film since it was so critically acclaimed. After you get used to the story inside another story played by the same actor the film starts to work.
" Excellent thriller but couldn't wrap my head around the ending
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,9,"The story is exceptional, until the cliffhanger at the end. I might need someone to explain it to me."
" Enjoyed it.
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,8,"The movie was really good! The plot was really smart and the actors too. Even the style was good! When you watch this movie,you can feel how the characters feel. It's a movie you must watch!"
" A beautiful thrilling masterpiece
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,10,"Incredibly well filmed, colorful, menacing, and captivating! I originally saw in the theater, now own on Blu-Ray happily. Jake Gyllenhaal and Aaron Taylor Johnson's performance are so glorious so is everyone else's. Love cinema like this very artsy with madness; well deserving of the nominations and Aaron's win for his electrifying role as Ray Marcus! Many amazing camera shots that make me wish I was a cinematographer, if not I'd want to co write, or edit either way I get inspired often."
" I did not like it, made me think of Mulholland Drive or Lost Highway
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,3,"I am not professional at reviews, I will probably not use the right words to express myself, also because English is not my native language.
I'd say the acting is very interesting (I am not not good at saying whether acting is good or not, I guess actors are acting as they are asked by directors, so this is not very often that I adventure myself in saying any acting is good or bad).
However, I did not like the story. It made me think of Mulholland Drive or Lost Highway, not sure about which one exactly, I think this is probably more Lost Highway; the atmosphere is interesting, characters are intriguing, but I would have needed some more answers, some more real facts to chew. I actually did rate quite good Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway at the time I saw it because of the atmosphere, but, now that I grew older and that I have seen more I need real thriller with real answers that would twist my mind, I guess some would say some more ""easy"" movies. This one does not seem to me to be very easy.
However, it might be loved by those who like interpreting movies a lot."
" Not much of a revenge movie
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,3,I managed to watch it all the way thru but all in all it was not very interesting. When I watch a revenge movie I like to see some good old hard core revenge taken out on the bad guys but that didn't happen. Very soft core revenge actually and the good guy also dies so what was the point?
" A Foul Experience
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,1,"A horribly weird sick disturbing film that leaves you feeling revolted after, it's like watching the worst news story's containing the worst crimes ever over and over again.
I watched it to the end and regret doing that, the first few minutes were hideous and I should have stopped then.
It's a sad world we live in when this stagnant nonsense is considered art."
" Gyllenhaal is going to have to see a doctor for his back after carrying this movie
",2020-01-15 00:00:00,6,"First off, this movie is a mess, but a very well acted one. Jake Gyllenhaal once again shows just how incredible of an actor he is and his performance single handedly made this movie enjoyable. The range of emotion he conveys is astounding and seeing his character go through these feelings is certainly an experience.Amy Adams is normally also a fantastic actor but she does not get to show that in this film due to her character only having two moods in the entire film: Sad and flirty. Michael Shannon is fantastic at what he gets to do in the film and Aaron Taylor-Johnson surprised me with a great performance considering I haven't seen him in much since his kick-ass days.Moreover, the score is fabulous and one of the things I liked most about this film. Another strong element is the cinematography that really helps set the mood, and some shots are very beautiful.
Now onto the negatives:As I said, the story is messy, incoherent and doesn't do a good enough job of connecting the two plots. It's so bad, that they completely feel like two different movies, something which truly bothered me. Following this point, the ending is also a complete wreck that neither ties anything together, nor gives any answer, and it's very unsatisfyinigFurthermore, the movie tries and fails, to be thrilling/scary which is dissapointing as that would take it to completely new heights in my opinion. Instead, it delivers one single jump scare and a revolting opening sequence that almost scared me away for a whole other reason."
" Jake Gyllenhaal
",2020-01-15 00:00:00,3,Would of been a good movie without Jake Gyllenhaal.When are they going to realise he is not any good.3 out of 10.Remove him and its an 8 out of 10.
" A good movie
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,9,"Except the intro, I enjoyed a lot this movie. He ""catch"" me in every way...and the ending is something who touch me deep inside."
" Misogynistic trash
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,1,"So, let's put aside the fact that the movie kind of goes everywhere and that the ending is dumb. This movie is straight up misogynistic trash.So obviously this film features the rape and murder of two female characters pretty early on. I'm not criticising the fact that rape appears in this movie. Films are allowed to depict this act, but it wasn't done right in this film. The way Tom Ford framed the bodies of the two victims was extremely sexualised and romanticised, focusing on the way their nakeds looked. I don't think he even attempted to capture the horrors of rape. I'm not saying that rape should never be portrayed, but the way it was done in this film felt offensive.I also want to focus on the anti-abortion stance that the movie takes, with the whole book that the husband wrote being an act of revenge for his ex-wife having had an abortion. Yes, because a mother and her daughter being brutally raped and then murdered is the same as a woman choosing to abort her foetus. The two are not comparable at all.Skip this movie. Tom Ford really needs to stick to designing clothes or whatever he does."
" Not particularly remarkable
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,6,"Gyllenhaal's performance is admirable, well directed but the story itself has little to offer. Love the title!"
" Didn't Work For Me
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,3,"(Flash Review)Nope, this is not about bats or graffiti artists. This is a movie that is woven together by two different plains; one real and one fictions. The plot is based around a fiction novel author who is in an unhappy marriage and once divorced while she attempts to write a thriller. The real plot, injected into the fictional plot, is the woman's emotional state around her relationship with both men (current and past husband) and her unresolved feelings. She is often somber and unhappy. The majority of the movie is the thriller story playing out where a family of three have a threatening encounter on the highway with three other local hoodlums, who later kidnap his wife and teenage daughter. How the stories play off of each other is important to figure out yet is very vague and cold due to the unsympathetic characters. This wasn't really enjoyable to watch and the concept, while intriguing, fell flat for me compounded by a lewd and inane opening scene."
" An intriguing, well-wrought film that explores penetrating questions. But for all its strengths it never quite breaks the surface.
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,8,"Meticulously crafted relationship / revenge drama with a very unusual narrative. Beautifully filmed, well acted and flawlessly directed the movie won't leave anyone indifferent, offering plenty of food for thought. Although the ending does not answer all questions the regular viewer might expect from his viewing experience, you still gotta admire the attempt to do something different here."
" You can't have your cake...
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,7,"What a marvellous film. Whilst the use of the flashbacks and the intertwining 'book within the movie' metaphor isn't that earth shattering, it's pulled off here immaculately and with fair precision.In a different film, it could have become easily muddled without the same handling. Ever regret messing up or squandering what could have been the love of your life at some point in your life? That's where this film smarts and hurts and reaches its true poignancy. I'd say it will touch a lot of nerves and whilst it can't be felt as a happy or uplifting film, it's skill and it's power to move is hard to deny. Is it a back roads revenge thriller, a morality tale, a sad torch song of unrequited and lost love...? Or maybe it just bears a single message: Love the one you're with."
" Something Doesn't Fit
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,6,"Nocturnal Animals is good. It's well made, and a fun ride. It's relatable and the actors do a great job. But something is amiss. The story perhaps doesn't go smoothly along as you'd expect. It's a movie best watched for the pieces rather than the whole, and lots of the pieces are top notch.Nocturnal Animals (it's been a while since I've seen it) is about story. That's all I could really divulge. It's a story within a story that's made fairly well.The movie is really dark, and has atmospheric elements. It's some hard hitting thrilling entertainment. I would highly suggest watching it.7 stars"
" Nice artsy movie about actions having consequences
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a vast improvement on the book it was based on, it is much more piercing, intelligent and distilled with some brilliant additions. Cinematography is outstanding, movie is atmospheric and highly stylized, reminiscent of the best works of Hitchcock and Kubrick, with great attention to minute details - deliberate style that comes across as natural, but only on second examination is revealed as extremely deep and thoughtful.The movie is concerned with Susan, an upper class woman married into wealth, that has since begun to crumble, who leads an empty life, that is falling apart, as she is unloved and deeply unhappy. She receives a novel, written by her ex-husband, who she cruelly abandoned as he was not able to provide the luxury she now lives in, being a ""weakling"" as a young aspiring writer, in estimation of her overbearing mother. The novel is about some scary rednecks destroying a man's family, after pushing their car off road. It turns out there are clear parallels between the redneck monsters in the story within a story and her actions, driven by her inner selfish monstrosity and cynical and rich mother but with the exact sophistication of an average redneck psychopath. Shattered to the core, after reading the book, she invites her ex to a dinner but is left waiting, and realizes sadly that she is never going to be forgiven, that hell is eternal and that her empty existence now is a karmic payback that she very well deserved for her past shallow choices and selfish crimes.The movie portrays some of the issues that are in fact pretty common, and the movie is partly underappreciated due to not fitting in the woke-hysteria that was just starting to boil at the time of movie release. But objectively, it is one hell of a masterpiece of sophisticated storytelling, that also carries a message about consequences of the wrong choices people make in life."
" Love it, except for one thing
",2019-10-07 00:00:00,8,"The movie is great. It has Tom Ford written all over it. However the women at the beginning were a bit unnecessary or at least the scene didn't have to drag for so long. Another thing was the jumpscare, when Susan is looking at the babycam. I definitely wouldn't mind that not being included. Otherwise props to Tom Ford. I hope he keeps on making movies like he said he would."
" Half n half
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,7,"Nocturnal animals it's a movie that takes a different approach on 2 common story's, a breakup and a crime.it's a smart movie that tries to tell both story's in one, I liked the acting, and the way the story is presented and glued together, I also found the movie interesting and kept me focused trying to find connections and picking up details between the storylines.But I liked the Texas crime line better and I felt it faded the main one, so for me it was a nice half movie and a regular half, but overall I enjoy the different approach."
" Wait till you see the end scene
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,9,"A film that has a calm atmosphere of the story. Calm cinematographic techniques, combined with music scoring that is soft-flowing and solemn, perfected by the cold expression of Gyllenhaal.The storyline of Nocturnal Animals steps slowly but firmly, giving the audience a sense of pity and drama. A tragedy was successfully displayed strongly. The plot of this film is not linear, so it's best to enjoy it in calm conditions with full concentration."
" Breathtaking
",2019-09-15 00:00:00,8,You must see this movie. it is so impressive and I felt those emotions while woman reading the book...sorry my english I can not explain more.
" A total waste of time
",2019-09-07 00:00:00,4,"Really poor. Don't believe the good reviews, or comparisons to Gone Girl, especially on Google and Reddit. This is really bad. The ending is really poor. What a waste of time.It is more like a poor version of Breakdown, which if you're looking for a story about a car break down, and a passenger getting kidnapped, watch Breakdown over this all day long. Breakdown is a brilliant psychological thriller."
" Tired and disappointing
",2019-09-06 00:00:00,5,I was expecting some sort of twist but it plays out just as you think and ends up being a damp squib. The plot of the revenge novel wasjust for kicks for the movie and the whole thing feels strained and contrived
" Great in Every Way
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,9,"Intense, shocking and suspenseful, Nocturnal Animals has chained me to my seat and chilled me to my bones.
The performances by Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhall and Michael Shannon are great.Also, a lot is encoded in the movie's visuals, so you might want to pay close attention to each scene's details."
" was very familiar to my feeling
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,10,In my opnion the great performance and great directing made this movie great
" Great movie, bad beginning
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,9,"First, I can't believed that Tom started with that disgusting and ugliest scene that I'd ever saw. I mean his a fashion designer, with a exquisite taste...However the rest of the movie it's a so interesting story. It's been a long while since I get caught by the screen. Beside the beginning it's very chic and sophisticated movie. thumb up for you Tom!"
" Wow
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,9,"I fell into this movie not really knowing a thing about it. A friend told me to watch it and I went for it. I'm so glad that I did. For starters, the score is amazing. It really has a way of putting you in a mood and refusing to let go.From the onset of the movie, we see an unhappy Susan in her unhappy life with her handsome husband in a luxurious and over-the-top home. These material goods bring her no joy and we can see that her life is in shambles.As the movie progresses, we start to see why. I don't want to spoil this one. It's best to go in blind and let the movie do what it does best. With one of the most tense scenes I've seen in years, Ford and Editor Joan Sobel pull off a masterpiece with dual storytelling aspects that had me deeply invested in both storylines up until the very end of the film.Give this one a watch but prepare to really have your mind open up into some places I never knew it could go."
" A Perfect Thriller with style and substance...
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,7,"A very dark intense n confusing psychological thriller from director tom Ford,Jake n Amy Adams both are currently two most talented performers in Hollywood by now..Susan (Amy adams) is an art gallery owner she receives a novel which written by a her ex husband.film take place in parallel narratives.Susan's tale in real present world and her ex husband's (Jake) tale in Novel...real world story is about Susan's miserable marriage life,novel storyline is a crime drama which is one of the most interesting part of this movie...Both Opening n ending sequences are most confusing than we except.even I'm still searching for more theories to

" my notes
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,5,"Very enjoyable for the most part, but very metaphor-y and symbolism-y. great acting all around but especially by gyllenhal and michael shannon. great cinematography and lots of beautiful shots (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
the ending, or lack of one, just pissed me off so much. it was such a book-ending. i saw a youtube video on the ending, thinking it was perfect that he got revenge by becoming successful and doing what she said he wasn't capable of, and then giving her a glimmer of hope before taking it away. i get that, and it is fitting, but it just was so ridiculously unsatisfying, an absolute wtf moment when he stood her up and they cut to blacksomething cool that i would have liked to see is if they kept it hidden that this was a revenge story, reveal that at the end when shows up completely messed up and angry and deranged, and laughs at her for not realizing he wrote the book to hurt her. maybe make her visions of the book show that he is fighting to get her back, and then at the reveal show his vision when he wrote it as seeking vengeance"
" Psychologically intriguing but underwhelming thriller
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,7,"This film is about Susan, a wealthy art gallery owner and the re-entry of her ex-husband into her life via his novel that he sends her to read previous to it being published. This happens 20 years after their marriage ended in a way that devastated him.The way that the film develops is unusual and interesting. Her life, drenched with cold colours and repression contrasts sharply with the unravelling of the novel as she reads it, with its warm colour palette and constant violence that it expresses. Through flashbacks we piece together what happened between Susan and ex-husband Edward and try to figure out what he's trying to say to her through his novel.This unravelling is interesting as the characters in the book as well as Edwards real-life behaviour all serve as symbols that reveal how he sees the separation of their marriage and other events surrounding it. The way it strikes me though is that this would all be a lot less meaningful to Susan if she weren't in a fragile state as a result of her marriage and becoming someone who she doesn't really want to be. So the film is as much about Edward being unable to move on from the trauma that happened 20 years ago as it is about Susan having a lot of unprocessed emotions that mostly stem from her relationship with her mother.The film is able to convey a lot with little but it lacks cohesion, moving on from important details a bit too quickly. The association between Susan and the antagonist characters in Edwards novel isn't very well developed and the central messages from the book could be better developed and more impactful. Though there's a lot to pull apart, overall it's a bit of an underwhelming film and though complex, not very deep in a way that's meangful or particularly thought provoking."
" Brilliant
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,10,"This movie has so many layers, you have to watch it twice to figure everything out. The story itself is complicated, but so many little details portraits complexity of this idea."
" Ending
",2019-07-15 00:00:00,9,"Amy Adams. Sharp objects. A Volvo. Now a Mercedes also from the eighties. I get it.
Although I may have snooped a little about her raising, I suppose there are more to her story. The way she is a atracked to some roles. She can prove me wrong. But still I see her. Unsettledness. An anger that belongs to herself, some dark agenda, not her characters. Beautiful and yet she feels a little out of that body. I don't see her sexuality as quite open but instead a complicated driven engine that has gotten her so far and yet... we are not here to talk about her. Who else. The director. Writer.
I have enough problems so my sixth sense tells me about movies that I should avoid and see at a distance... Eighteen years for Moulin Rouge. I was right.
So this nocturnal animal could be the same person that engraved herself sharply...
The self is a mischievous entity.
I could be both also, I've been that and more.
So you see, it's too personal for me.
Without doubt one piece of true consistency and a good choice for both endings, entropy and randomness are not so random. Never are.
Don't get me wrong, she does something. Moi, inversement.
Work should help her a lot.
I didn't forget Jake and Michael excellent roles. But it's always about her even if it is about a couple or a dismembered family. I know a little about that also.
Many springs have come and now, Autumn leaves are letting me choose.
The movie could have chosen otherwise.
Congratulations for a job well done.
You see, there's music and painting, digital arts, games, writing and a place were all gather.
You should know that I'm no good.
So I could be her or any of them, all grey, except that sucker of new husband repugnant creature.
Good stuff. A banal story turned into something worthy.
Godspeed"
" A modern count of Monte Cristo
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,10,"The main theme of the movie is the dilemma between forgiving and avenging. There is the main character, Susan, who is just gorgeous in every scene. Bothe her husband (Edward) and daughter only care about having sex, while she is left alone with no one to love, no affection, no family life or human life. Her routine is all abput hanging out with rich people, and convincing them to buy ugly and nasty modern art from the gallery she manages.But she remembers that once in her life she had a husband with a more conventional worldview. He is awriter, and gives her this book which imagines his life whether they stuck together and raised their own family. ( the actresses portraying the wife and daughter are different, but they represent Susan and her daughter ). He is just a down to earth guy, who happens to be in a situation that he is not prepard to deal. Th movie is about all the expectation that men are supposed to be strong and protect their families, but in reality there are a lot of folks who are not prepared to deal with violence and intimidation.So in this fictional tale Edward shows that his weakness in the end haunts him, and Susan starts feeling guilty for abandoning him and hopes to see him again. In the book, Edward attempts to be strong, but it is so hard to be the opposite of your true nature. In the end the movie is a depiction of how woman hurt men who love them and care about them when they choose the strong, wealthy (and unfaithful) just because they can priovide them the status of trophy wife.And in the end,the result is she (Susan) is the unhappy one. Unable to care, with no morals or no compassion, onpy regrets."

" Vacuous Waste of Time
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,2,"Nocturnal animals may grab your attention for it's reported tension, mystery and depth. I'm not at all sure what this is actually based on.The premise is that the protagonist is contacted by her ex-husband who has written a novel dedicated to her titled 'Nocturnal Animals' supposedly a name he used to describe her. As she reads its sad and violent story, details of her own life are revealed and the story of how her relationship with her former husband played out. So we have a story within a story that's presented as a film within a film with another short side film detailing the protagonist's past.The problem is the arch story is virtually non existent. The story within the text of the novel is, although violent and saddening, simple and shallow. The side story of the protagonists relationship with her ex-husband is also dull.We have three mundane half finished stories woven together that simultaneously fade away into nothing. If there's an artistic point to this, and I doubt there's a valid one, I don't think it's worth anyone's time.I'm on the verge of suspecting the writer here is, like his main character, parading his art and telling us 'It's garbage. It's all garbage.' It really felt that way to me. No worthwhile plot. No exceptional cinematography. Nothing clever.The cast were strong. The only reason it wasn't the lowest possible rating."

" Tom Ford is probably a genius
",2019-05-07 00:00:00,8,"What a movie! Inspite of telling a 3-way story this movie manages to be cohesive.The credit goes to Tom Ford who steers the narratives without cluttering them.Amy Adams & especially Jake Gyllenhaal are fantastic in their roles.And a shoutout to Aaron Taylor-Johnson who plays a hate-worthy part to perfection.He was so creepy,without any heavy dialogue.He conveys such disdain with just his body language! The storytelling is very interesting & avoids the pitfalls that come with it.There is a layered symbolism that unravels,the better you understand the characters.Some casting choices are also very smart.The movie jumps between timelines and sometimes it's hard to follow since you are so invested in all the timelines.Tom trusts his viewers to remember the visual cues..all of which reveal something that is not entirely expressed.This in tune with the other parts of the movie.An attentive viewing is essential to 'get' this movie.Hard to watch at times,but really rewarding movie.Recommend it!"
" Intriguing or confusing?
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,6,"This movie got me both intrigued and confused.I'm intrigued, because I felt much for Susan's (Amy Adams) mental struggle: what kind of a person amI? What do I want to be? How do I deal with people and the world?I'm also confused, because the movie ends with Susan just as confused as she was at the beginning. All the characters in this movie are precarious and kept off balance, which put me as a viewer on the edge wondering what comes next, but also made me uncomfortable.The two main casts, Jake Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams, are superb. The plot is also interesting, with two storylines (the real world and the book) proceeding in parallel. Susan's emotions move back and forth painfully between these two arcs. You won't waste your two hours with this movie if you are a thriller fan.I still have a hard time figuring out what the point of this movie is, apart from reminding me of how difficult life is if you do not know your place in the world. Wait, what is the point of life after all?By the way, IMDb rating statistics suggest an interesting point: younger viewers rate this movie higher than older ones do. Perhaps rating of this movie correlates with how settled and secure you feel in life."
" Weird and disturbing
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,4,"The visuals are great and all but it is SO UNCOMFORTABLE AND CREEPY.
Too artistic and abstracted for a dark yet empty story. Everything in that movie is uncomfortable."
" An unconventional revenge fantasy?
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,8,A captivating film. No filler. Ford does a great job building tension throughout. Every interaction builds upon the last. Ford has a keen sense for distinguishing character details and eye for heartbreaking truisms about relationships. Good performances all around.
" Say what
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,4,This movie doesn't make no kind of sense and it isn't even entertaining in the slightest
" As intoxicating as it is clever; beautiful.
",2019-04-15 00:00:00,9,"Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals (adapted from the novel Tony and Susan by Austin Wright) is the kind of film that's great enough when you experience it, but gets even better when you think about it afterwards. Having seen it, I feel a second viewing may be rewarding if you want to understand it fully and sufficiently appreciate all the subtle touches of its presentation. My third viewing will simply be because I loved it.Nocturnal Animals tells its story through several layers. Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) is a Los Angeles-based artist with her own gallery and a wealthy spouse with more looks than personality (Armie Hammer, as it were). A package reaches her office one day, sent by her ex-husband, a struggling writer named Edward Sheffield, containing a first draft of his first proper novel. For whatever reason, he has dedicated this thriller to Susan, even using his old nickname for her as its title - a ""nocturnal animal"", he would call her.The book opens on Tony Hastings (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) as he is driving through the Texas desert by night with his wife and child (Isla Fisher and Ellie Bamber). They have an increasingly nasty encounter with a bunch of redneck types, bossed around by the utterly unhinged Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor-Johnson in what must be the greatest performance he will ever give). He and his goons first pry Tony off the road with their vehicle, and then offer to change one of his busted tires for him in what Glenn Kenny referred to as ""one of the most discomfortingly suspenseful sequences in a Hollywood film since Blue Velvet"". The fact that it achieves this in spite of being (we assume) in-Universe fiction speaks volumes about Ford's abilities as a filmmaker, not to mention the performances.The altercation ends with Tony being separated from his family and left on his own in the middle of the desert. He manages to make his way to a small town and enlist the help Detective Bobby Andes (a stupendously entertaining Michael Shannon) to track down Marcus and his crew, but he soon finds out that there isn't a happy end to this tale as the tale itself turns into one of cold revenge. Outside of said tale, more side characters exist, such as Susan's disapproving mother played by Laura Linney, an artsy fashion disaster played by Jena Malone, and Zawe Ashton as a colleague of Susan's who is too young to relate to Susan's sudden feelings of having wasted her life.In addition to the scenes set ""in reality"" and the parts that take place in Edward's story, flashbacks from Edward and Susan's time together start to appear as soon as Susan begins reading. There are numerous visual parallels between the narratives, which speaks to a larger thematic connection between the story of Tony and that of Edward's history with Susan. Some of the scenes also involve shifts in tone and style - even genre - but it his handled with such prodigious skill that it never once feels jarring.One of the most remarkable scenes in this movie, however, is its opening sequence, wherein a collection of nude, insanely overweight women are dancing seductively in slow-motion as a beautiful score plays and confetti rains over them. This is, of course, a part of Susan's art installation, but its effect is very much felt by observers outside of the film's universe. When we exited the theater, my brother wondered if this intro was meant to be a straightforward defiance of societal beauty norms or if it was rather a critique on ""feminist propaganda"" (the latter of which would have been more to his liking) and thus probably also a critique on provocative artists like Susan. Whatever the intent, I can admit to being mildly put off and befuddled at first, but quickly began to marvel at how visible uncomfortable all the other attendees at the screening were. In a strange way I admired it, and I knew the tone was set for the impending experience.The film is also so delicate and meticulous in the way it looks. From all the subtleties in Amy Adams' no less than Oscar-worthy performance to the clothes that her character chooses to wear at a given moment (Need I mention that Tom Ford is a fashion designer?), the character of Susan Morrow alone is the result of intricate, grade A craftsmanship. Her co-stars are at least equally resplendent, and they are shot and lit with the grace of someone who truly knows a thing or two about eye-pleasing aesthetics. Some of the scenes set within Edward's book do come off as a bit amateurish, but I feel as if there's purpose behind it.Nocturnal Animals is precise, beautiful, oftentimes shocking, briefly funny at the right times (thanks in no small part to Taylor-Johnson and Shannon), wonderfully depressing, and told to us with intricacy and cleverness. Its ""story-within-a-story plus something else"" structure made me think of Aronofsky's The Fountain, but I have a feeling more people will appreciate how it's done by Tom Ford."
" The end is so satisfying
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,9,Take some time to understand the movie you're gonna like it
" Great
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,9,Super tense and great performances especially from Aron Taylor Johnson and great directing
" Wide open ending Lol
",2019-04-01 00:00:00,6,"Enjoyed every thing about this movie but the ending. A lot of movies leave the ending wide open for the viewers lately so they can decide or create their own ending as if it was their story or the very least they want everyone to decide for themselves but people I watched your movie, your work, and your story and i like it but what I don't like is when i see cowards running away from their work just because they are afraid of ruining their work at the end. I'm sorry to say this but honestly i have no respect for these movie directors who are ruining good movies, stories, and even incredible acting performance by Jake Gyplenhaal and Amy Adams."
" A lot of flash, but very little substance.
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,6,"Nocturnal Animals was watchable, but it was not quite as clever as it presented itself to be. The positives of the movie were that the story-within-a-story mechanism was interesting, it was beautifully shot, the actors delivered great performances, and it was presented as a stylish, polished overall package. But in spite of all of these positives, I still felt that the movie had nothing to offer beneath the surface. The inner story was supposed to be a symbolic representation of the destruction that had occurred in Susan's past. The grimy thriller approach to showing that destruction was indeed effective, and I wondered if that could have made a better movie on its own. The escalating sequence between the family and the men at the beginning of the story was gripping and terrifying. On the other hand, the sexual violence involved in this story (and how it was shown & described) made me extremely uncomfortable, and I was seriously considering an exit at that point.The connections made between these two stories were also too obvious. As the story unfolds, you get this mapping of how the events in the first story connect to the events in the second story. The pacing of both stories was such that this happened side-by-side, so there was really no sense of mystery involved in this process. While this was happening, I also felt that I did not care much about Susan as a character. The only characterization I had on her was that she had made regrettable choices, and that she ruminated on those problem in her monstrosity of a home. I wanted to see where her story would go, but ended up feeling blank when it eventually ended. I did not feel that the ending was ambiguous in any way, simply because the movie included a scene around a painting that quite literally spelled out 'REVENGE' in obscenely large letters.To summarize, I thought that Nocturnal Animals was a movie with a lot of flash and very little substance. When a movie has ended and you still don't care about the main character, it's hard to rate it as being 'good'."
" Solide and meaningful
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,9,"While the movie starts very disturbing at the beginning, you get a first feeling of what the story is going to let you feel: sadness/anger/empathy. I watched a lot films of Gyllenhall, since he became one of my favourite Actor, and this was the reason I decided to watch this movie.As the movie goes on, you had this idea of ,,hell I had to concentrate myself of not loosing the sight for what is fiction and what is Reality.
Gyllenhall and Adams play their roles really great.
But I must recommend that this movie has a high abstract level, so I can understand the many reviews of 1-3 stars for it. You only see what you know!!!!
You definitely have to think a lot...
all in all it's definitely a movie worth watching."
" What are you, an Owl?
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,9,"Missef-hbaker or whatever you go by. You don't understand what you are even talking about so stick to your usual YouTube trolling. Stay out of iMDB, capichee?BbWith that out of the way, this movie will tap into every primal emotion of the human psyche, and all of the actors on screen perform incredibly well. This movie deserves much more praise than it received.The people, like this person mentioned earlier, are obviously the triggered types and ya, this movie may trigger you, but that's exactly what the writer and director was going for. I went into it with really no expectations, and that's what you need to do with this one. If you don't get it, well you don't get. But don't come on here throwing 1 stars and insults expecting anyone to give any real respect or recognition to you."
" Stop writing your bad term papers on IMDb
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,8,"One of those movies you don't want to end. Gyllenhal distilles all his best rolls into this: night crawler, prisoners, enemy, velvet buzzsaw. Amazing 10/10, I've never seen a film that balances gritty/violent and beautiful/cerebral outside of maybe the coen brothers."
" Phenomenal
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,10,"Seamless integration of multiple perspectives in past and present. Adams and Gyllenhaal at their best. Such vulnerability in both, such striving, but in different directions, different contexts. Michael Shannon does a fantastic job as the detective. Can't say enough about this film. Parts of it are so tragically believable."
" Dark, atmospheric and stylish movie
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,8,"With a solid cast of actors, I had high expectations for the movie. The setting of Los Angeles and the fashion world gives it a slightly otherworldly feel and adds to the atmosphere, like neon demon. The scene on the highway with the cars is one of the most tense scenes I've seen in recent in memory. It is also effective at portraying the frustration of seeing Tony fail to act strongly in his role. As well, it wasn't until I saw the credits that I realized that Johnson was the main antagonist. He really immersed himself in the role of an awful character."
" Not boring love story
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,10,Very intense and captivating story from the very beginning. I recommend.
" I only liked it because of Jake Gyllenhaal.
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,6,"My Rating : 6/10The plot is nothing original that's not been done before. It's a good slow-burn type of movie. Tom Ford's aesthetic really makes it beautiful to look at and without Jake Gyllenhaal it wouldn't be half as good as it is, at least for me as I think he's an awesome lead actor.I enjoyed it, just that it's nothing new or different."
" Masterful tension
",2019-02-13 00:00:00,9,"This physiological thriller by Tom Ford is mesmerising.Despite it's slow start with some questionable framing choices, the film kicks into gear with a tension ridden story that is masterfully performed by the actors. Micheal Shannon and Jake Gyllenhaal provide depth and nuanice to their characters. The story is King in this film, tightly composed, it had me hooked the moment it hit second gear (despite it's slow start).I went into this film not expecting to be wowed but I was. This is a must see, truly enjoyable.9/10"

" tom ford usual
",2019-02-06 00:00:00,7,"Tom Ford's first film since 'A Single Man' is another winner, an ambitious high-wire noir thriller with Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal in an explosive tale of love, violence, and revenge."
" A book of fiction, A story of reality
",2019-02-06 00:00:00,8,"The movie begins with the life of Amy Adams' character who we quickly find out is in a relationship with a cheating husband. At the same time her ex-husband(Jake) has sent her a fictional book to read which truly marks the beginning of the movie.The movie revolves around the reality that is Amy's character reading the novel and the fiction that is the story of Jake's character in the novel. The movie constantly switches between the two and it becomes apparent quickly that the novel is especially meaningful to Amy's character and the lines of fiction and reality begin to be blurred in a sense.The novel seems to essentially be depicting Jake's feelings/life during his life with and after Amy. The tense 20 minute scene where Ray and his crew surround Jake, Amy and Daughter and finally abscond with them looks to be a metaphor for Amy's new husband taking her from Jake.(Side note: Jake was a bit of a pussy, barely put up a fight). Amy ultimately dying may be an allusion to the way Jake felt inside, that he had lost a woman he truly loved. Jake finally confronting Ray(the rapist and killer) could symbolize him finally finding peace with the situation and thus him writing the novel he always wanted. In reality this could be a way to not only show Amy how he felt metaphorically but also to perhaps maybe even pass on a bit of guilt her way.Back in reality we see that Amy is not handling reading the Novel perfectly as she hallucinates Jake and also focuses on a poster titled revenge. This focus on the revenge poster could be to give insight that Amy realizes that the book was not simply meant for her to read nut also to get her thinking of the wrong she did.In the end Amy asks to meet Jake but Jake never shows up. Perhaps this is the end of the ultimate revenge in which Jake get the last laugh as he did in the novel. Jake not showing up could be for a number of reasons. Maybe he cant go through the sight of seeing someone he finally got over. Maybe he justs wants her to feel what he felt. Or maybe he killed himself just as he did at the end of the novel after finally writing the perfect novel/getting over Amy.Overall I enjoyed the movie. The acting was great from both Amy and Jake and I loved the direction of 2 stories coinciding and the fiction basically being symbolic of the reality that transpired. I still wonder if it would have been better if the movie focused solely on the novel as though that were reality and that story was fleshed out with more tension throughout trying to locate Amy and ultimately the killers. I found myself not really caring for reality at some points in the film and only wanting to see the novel scenes. Which i think perfectly depicts that Jake did finally write the perfect novel he was looking for.A even crazier idea I had while watching the movie was that the whole kidnapping the girls scene was actually something that really happened and was a flashback. It obviously became clear this wasn't the case when they died. But suppose all this happened in reality without Amy and daughter dying and she had to live with this for the rest of her life.... and the movie revolves around this???I dont now just giving off some thoughts that came across my mind. Enjoyed the movie, great watch."
" Powerful
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,9,"I am not usually an appreciator of the types of movies that critics like to talk about, but this film absolutely resonated with me. This movie is essentially two stories in one. The first is the story of Susan, an upper-class woman who recieves a copy of her ex-husband's new novel, Nocturnal Animals. The second story is Edward's novel, a violent story of regret and revenge.
As the stories continue we learn more about Susan and Edward's relationship and therefore the motivations behind the novel. We learn about the things Susan criticized Edward for, his sensitivity or 'weakness'. And this is what the novel Nocturnal Animals is all about: a man trying to overcome the impotence that allowed his wife and daughter to be taken away from him.
I loved the complexities of the characters and the transitions between the two startlingly different stories. The scenes are beautifully done and the acting is superb. The one thing I did not expect was the ending: it could not have been more perfect."
" And we wonder why we're twisted.
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,8,"Speechless, well almost. That ending had me howling like a wolf. I can see this being one of those films that will hit home for many of the modern day singles who have earned their scars in the battle for romance. I wasn't sure what to really think at first when the film started, but it definitely started catching my attention about 1/4 way in. The plot description doesn't really do it much justice, but the film itself does a good job at carrying itself through right to the end. There is some great acting all across the board here, with many familiar faces executing their roles with precision. Oh man, so many heart wrenching moments... The flashbacks of emotional agony. But as they say, it's better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all."
" Enjoyable film!
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,8,"We enjoyed it. There are frustrating parts for sure. It's entertaining and parts are thrilling, Amy Adams is great. I wouldn't preferred a different ending, felt very empty but give it a whirl!"
" A masterpiece that leaves you with deep thoughts
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,9,"Forget about Amy and Jake.. Micheal Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson really nailed it , and with a great plot and meaningful open sided ending, plus the overwhelming soundtracks..it is a movie you won't easily forget"
" Chilling
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,10,"The plot gives you this feeling of natural evolution of things. It doesn't rush anything, nor it is flat and boring. It just goes on and on, it keeps you focused and as the two stories unfold you get involved personally with the characters.It is trully amazing how the two stories connect with each other. You can see clearly the metaphors Edward uses to bring on paper the hurt that he endured from his break-up. The assassination of Tony's wife and daughter symbolizes the abortion and the betrayal of Susan.The Sheriff's cancer nakes him face the facts without the fear of consequencess. He sets his life towards bringing justice in order to find his peace. It is very symbolical considering that he is a man living alone, alienated from his daughter, pretty much caught up in work, until his life is on the line and he realises that hardly any rapists and vandals like Ray face the consequences of their crimes.In Susan we see every woman fighting to escape being her mother, we see how artists grow cynical when they are not in peace with themselves and how insecurities considering her social profile and evolution get the best of her.Tony is the eternal romantic artist. So much to say on this matter, not enough words to do so.This is an amazing movie. The lack of music during the most of it gives you a sense of reality. You experience everything deeply and raw."

" Beautifully made movie with highly sinister message.
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,5,"Sometimes relationships don't last. Sometimes people do things that aren't what you would hope for. Especially when young. If you are the kind of person who thinks dedicating your life to a flaccid revenge against your first love is some kind of anything except highly, highly insane and disturbing.. well.. you need to reconsider your life a little bit. She was right not to choose him. He was a petty, vindictive creep. I'm seeing people in the comments saying things like 'Is that all she got for breaking his heart?' I can't believe that many people get through life without going through the sad situation of breaking someone's heart or having your own heart broken. These experiences usually strengthen our empathy and care for each other, not send us on a NINETEEN YEAR long strop culminating in a book, a missed dinner date and some kind of chalky-smug aftertaste. The film was well-made and acted excellently, but the morals read like an extended incel cry-w*nk."

" Masterful
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,8,"An amazing piece of film, Nocturnal Animals was astounding. Writing this after a rewatch the quality of character and performance is amazing with the obvious standout being Jake Gyllenhaal. Cutting between the shell of an existence that's befell Amy Adams' character and Edward's brutal novel which reflects his pain following a major decision made in the characters relationship it's borderline artwork what unfolds. Stunning shots and strong, well developed character it's a truly astounding film"
" Beautifully shot, but cold and lifeless
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,6,"Nocturnal Animals is beautifully shot throughout but at the same time it is cold and lifeless. The characters fail to elicit any sympathy, particularly the central character played by Amy Adams. The camera adores Adams with its languorous shots of her, but her cold character, and Adams lack of emotional range as an actor leaves the viewer cold and unsympathetic.Amy Adams plays Susan Morrow, a wealthy art gallery owner whose ex-husband, Edward, a writer, played by Jake Gyllenhall, sends her a draft of his new novel. The plot of the novel plays out in parallel with Susan's present while reading the novel and past scenes from her relationship with Edward.The story within a story, the novel, is diverting in its early stages and grips the viewer. Early scenes in it, with Gyllenhall also playing the role of the novels protagonist Tony, as he and his family come across a group of violent thugs, are powerful. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, as Ray Marcus, the gang leader is particularly terrifying.But the film slows after that as Michael Shannon's cop gets involved in helping Tony while Susan's story struggles to find a decent conclusion. The film is left without any real substance beyond the first half-hour and peters out.The film has strong performances by Taylor-Johnson and the ever reliable Shannon. But Adams and Gyllenhall are too weak in the central roles to carry the film. While a whole series of strong actors including Andrea Riseborough, Michael Sheen and Laura Linney are wasted in throwaway roles.Apart from its cold beauty and the performances of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Michael Shannon there is nothing to recommend this film which is a major disappointment after director Tom Fords excellent debut film A Single Man."

" While sleek and stylish, Nocturnal Animals doesn't reach the depth it shoots for
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,6,"I was so ready to love this movie. A dark, intense thriller starring Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal - what could be better? While the parallels between book and character lives do leave you with something to consider, I did find it to overall be more pseudo-intellectual than actually clever. The story-inside-a-story idea is clearly tough to pull off, and Ford just doesn't manage to develop either cleanly. We never get enough to be invested in Susan at all, as all we really see are her reflections of herself and a few past experiences. The book plot was tense and atmospheric, but I disliked Ford's constant need to pull us back and remind us that this is all through the eyes of Susan. Plenty of the real world scenes didn't tell us anything and just reinforced the high class, artistic setting. The connection between their lives and the story does add something to the movie - Edward thinking their relationship is going well and then it starts slipping away as he doesn't know how to stop it. Trying to manage two plots and flesh them both out proves to be too difficult a task, and we end up with a satisfying Western thriller that we get repeatedly pulled out of to see the reaction of a regretful woman who never really does anything. The ambiguity of the ending is, emblematically of the movie, thought-provoking and well shot but doesn't really bring anything home or back to the audience. Shannon is great, and I will never cease to love Gyllenhaal's range, but while it had plenty of subtext and symbolism, there wasn't enough substance for me to really ever get into it."

" grabs you by the throat
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,10,"Not sure how I missed this upon theatrical release, maybe there was something about the publicity I took against. Anyway seen it now and it is a great viewing experience. Involving from the start, well to be honest it grabs you by the throat to the extent that you cannot envisage the film going on for much longer, and continues in similarly involving scenes, if not quite so violent. I understand that director Tom Ford originally envisaged turning the book, upon which it is based, into two separate movies but settled for entwining the two stories. Intelligent and spot on script that involves us both in the terrible Texas scenes and the (awful in their own way) Los Angeles rich life moments. Amy Adams is excellent as the poor little rich girl with regrets for a life lost and Lake Gyllenhaal great in both his roles. There is ambiguity throughout but then that is always preferable to the blatantly obvious. I should also mention the masterful look that is established both in the arty farty Californian lifestyle moments and in the desert scenes with the interstate and those fantastic skies."
" Which is more dangerous a loaded gun or a blank manuscript...
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,8,"Part of my Michael Shannon Appreciation binge.Sometimes it's hard to sort out our avenging angels and devils, and the pen isn't really mightier than the pistol, or is it? Guess it might depend on how deep the wounds go and how long they last. Or how long you the viewer last?I was both pistol-whipped and plot-whipped by this (it's not a pleasant film), but stuck around to finish the job.Anyways, the less you know about this film the better, and yeah if you too go on an MSA binge, I'd certainly recommend this one in the mix. Good for a Thu night, the darker the better."
" Wait, that was the end? meh.
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,2,"I had no knowledge of this film before I watched it. I love a good psychological thriller, I enjoy being confused and I'm not averse to social views of the film makers.
So I watched with no prejudgement.
When the end came, flopping around like a dying fish, I just felt nothing. I didn't care about the relationship. So the bad guy died, great I guess.
I felt cheated of a decent story. The conclusion of which was just empty fluff. Aww she left him and turned out to be shallow. Aww he ghosted her for her shallowness. Urgh, it's like watching a vengeful teenager play out their romantic issues on screen in a really clunky way so that the viewer walks away thinking ""well that was a load of old blather""
What was the point of it? The moral being that the art/fashion world is vapid isn't enough of a statement. Not the way this was done at least.
The fact that the very people the film is biting its thumb at are the very same people to give it rewards and great reviews just says it all for me.
It was like the filmmaker realised their tale of vengeance wasn't enough to make a whole film so added this pretentious other layer in an attempt to look more clever than they are.
So in conclusion, vastly overrated and disappointing."
" Anti Southern Agenda
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,3,"This film is yet another vehicle for maintaining the platitudinous Hollywood programming that coastal city residents live in freedom adn safety whilst Southern people are evil and that in particular Texas is hell on earth. Although you'll be far more likely to get carjacked, robbed and raped in multi cultural California or the tri-state area, here it is proposed that the ultimate danger in the U.S. is personified bys poor white folk a.k.a. white trash. Texas politics and its judicial system are also allegedly completely stacked against victims and function only to defend (white) criminals, even though, once again, California is in fact the state with the most corruption and that is thriving on aiding legally all sorts of criminals (illegal immigrants, murderers, looters). There are also some snide suggestions that rich Texans are sexist, racist, homophobic and their religion makes them ""bad"" people; the worst criticism is always reserved for catholicism, (not surprisingly). The reality is that Californians, are currently escaping to states like Texas, to flee the danger, disturbing demographic changes and financial despair that is looming large over its residents. In Texas people carry guns so they can defend themselves, and can prevent awful things from happening to people - that should be the lesson learnt in this film. Hollywood is painting a false inbalanced picture with this movie, a topsy turvy version of the truth. What's new?"

" Multi-layered but not contrived
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,8,"Nocturnal Animals. Superbly acted fictional story set within another fictional story set over two time periods. Basically a revenge thriller, sort of. Jake Gylenhall plays a character in a book which a character also played by Jake Gylennhall wrote, dedicated to his former wife, played by Amy Adams, who we see over different time periods, but not in the novel - as Jake's wife is played by someone who merely looks like Amy Adams. Sound confusing? Whatever, it was enthralling throughout. 8 and a half out of ten"
" Why a Masterpiece ?
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,10,"Why a MasterpieceThe three stories described are very well constructed.

" What kind of Movie is this?
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,3,"It was interesting at the beginning of the movie. But it was inconclusive in the end. So is it supposed to be a single movie or multiple movie packed up into one?Sure it's a serious movie with deep emotions involved. But where the emotions should go is plain and empty. After watching this movie, you'll wonder, what is it all about?Is it story 1, story 2, or story 3?
Are movie writers losing their creativity to put essence in the movie? Or do they just care how it was presented to viewers?People who put high scores are basically people who do not care about the essence or goal of a movie. Whereas people who put low scores are real rational people who conceive this more of an art style to be published in some Movie festival disregarding what common people think.If you're in the film industry, it's something that you might watch, especially when you're just bored of filming all day long. If you're common people like me, throw it in the trash."

" This is better than you expect, much better
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,9,"Nocturnal Animals by Tom Ford (2016)
Great movie where the plot is a lot greater than it looks. This story is about Susan, an art gallery owner that is married and has a good life, but not everything is what it seems. Susan receives the draft of a book written by Edward, her ex-husband.
To begin with, the story has a structure in three lines, the present, the flashbacks where Susan remembers her life with Edward and the story itself written in the book. Absolutely interesting way to tell a story, definitely is the viewer's job to put everything together, build the story and discover the causes of actual consequences.
The characters are all a great work and are well established for the story. As a character, Susan is interpreted by Amy Adams whose beauty was taken advantage of through the film. Amy's acting skills were excellent, portraying a woman with emptiness in the look, that is lacking of something and help us to develop the character. Jake Gyllenhaal is Edward in real life and Tony in the book; for Tony's character he's a husband and father that discovers the deepest thoughts about life and revenge after living the loss of his family; and Edward, a magnificent character with whom we empathize even when we don't know a lot about him. Michael Shannon represents Bobby, the sheriff that took Tony's case in the book. And finally, we have Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ray, that animal that took everything from Tony in the book. They all build the story and themselves as the movie moves on, they are developed as original minds and personalities.
Everything about the book is related to some stages Edward passed through when he was with Susan, ending in a beautiful death of our main character, understanding this as the reborn of Edward. This is why the development of the movie is so interesting, discovering the way Edward is describing his life through Tony, and living how Susan suffers for that, how she realizes what she could have done better and how she is now something that she didn't want to be.
The film's photography is detailed and well illuminated, every scene looks framed and with real colors, something really inspiring. The music is kind of classic and brings an essence of calm and chaos at the same time.
In the final scene and through the conclusion of the movie we realize how unhappy Susan is, in my case, that Edward is not going to assist to their dinner and that the heartbreak that Susan caused on him inspired the book that she's actually reading (inspired in many, many ways)."
" Best movie I've seen in a good while, a classic masterpiece
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,9,"This is a movie you wouldn't expect to see in this day and age, that's why some people may not understand or appreciate it. I didn't know what to expect and even I felt a bit confused in the end, there doesn't seem to be much of a resolution and the whole movie may feel a bit pointless, but after doing some thinking and reading other reviews I'm ready to say that this is a modern masterpiece. Superbly written and crafted in vein of Verhoeven (Basic Instinct), Fincher (The Game), Lynch (Lost Highway), Polanski (Chinatown) and even Hitchcock.The movie is about a rich ""bourgeois"" art gallerist Susan (Amy Adams) reading a book written by her more down to earth ex-husband Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal). Doesn't necessarily sound very interesting, but it is. I'm not going to open up the story deep down, it's been done very well in many other reviews, but I'm going to say tho that it's at the same time very subtle and symbolical as well as surprisingly straight story without twists that will blow your mind. It's very much a drama and a love story. I'm not even sure if you can call it a crime movie as the crimes all happen in the book she's reading. It's also Edwards story, as ""he only writes about himself"". The book Susan is reading makes up most of the movie tho and it's very intense crime thriller most of the time. But it's not so much about the book, but how it all reflects to Susans past life, which we also get to see in well placed flashbacks.This movie is clearly a homage to classic crime dramas of 50's to 90's. It's very similar in noir mood, gorgeous cinematography that uses a lot of long lenses, absolutely amazing orchestral soundtrack and great character driven story. The ending, which some have heavily criticised and which even I first thought was a bit unexpected, but after thinking about it, it's amazing and and absolutely one of the best endings I've seen in a while. I actually feel like watching the movie again and this time prepare for the ending to fully appreciate it.A modern classic in every way."
" Must watch
",2018-09-07 00:00:00,9,Do people really know how to watch a movie? What is up with all these 1 stars man this was one of the best movies i have ever watched in years. I say dont let yourself get distracted with all these low ratings and watch this movie and you will not regret it.
" Dark bro, very dark
",2018-09-07 00:00:00,9,"I really enjoyed this film and loved almost everything. The film has a ""story-within-a-story"" feel which I just loved and the cast were stella, you could really tell that they cared about their performances and put effort and passion into every scene. Jake Gyllenhaal gave an emotional, powerful and convincing performance. In my opinion he was able to capture the vulnerability and frustration of a man who struggles to be the man society wants him to portray. Amy Adams was fantastic and really did portray a woman who has everything she thought she wanted but still feels empty inside. The two of them have great chemistry and I found the flashbacks to their previous life to be very interesting and enjoyable to watch. Especially as their relationship starts to break down because of Edwards sensativity and susans ambition and dissatisfaction, with Edward, grows.The cinematography has a perfect balance between the light and darkness of the situations presented. The contrast between the ""real world"" and the ""story world"", in terms of colour, is very interesting. Everything in Susans world feels fabricated, dark and sleek giving me this feeling of an absence of colour in her life since she left Edward. In contrast the scenes with her and Edward, and the scenes in the ""story world"" are very colourful with a certain grit to them. There are some great supporting characters and Michael Shannon in particular is just a great pleasure to watch. The only problem I have is there are a couple of characters, in particular Carlos and Alissia that seem out of place. There is a scene where they mention that Carlos is a secret gay that really goes nowhere. Its like ""why put that in the movie""??? It serves no purpose to the plot at all???? In fact it confused me, that's why it gets a 9/10 instead of higher from me. Check this one out....or don't. I'm not in charge of your life!"
" Beautifully Stylized, Seductive Thriller
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,9,"I'd had Nocturnal Animals shortlisted for a while now, and after finally watching it last night I have no idea why I'd waited so long to watch it. The perfect balance of style and substance, I was immediately captivated by the stunning cinematography, alluring sets, and lush costume design but once the story-within-a-story began to unfold I realized there was much more to this film than the eye candy. I don't remember the last time I was so thoroughly entertained by a new film. The casting was perfect and every actor is at the top of their game here, no performance feels even remotely phoned-in. Amy Adams shines as the haunted lead, Susan; meanwhile, Gyllenhaal gives one of the finest and most memorable performances of his career (right up there with Brokeback Mountain and Nightcrawler) as Susan's former husband Edward, and as Susan's mental image of the fictional character Tony, the protagonist from Edward's novel. But perhaps the best, and most unnerving, of all is Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the degenerate villain, Ray. There's a lot to love about this film, but the sharp contrast between Susan's empty, decadent life in the post-post-modern world of high art in LA and the ugly, rugged desert thriller of Edward's novel is one of my favorite features. Combine that with excellent pacing and a thought-provoking ending that's bound to stay with you for a few days and you're left with one of the most satisfying thrillers of the past decade."
" Relevance?
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,9,"Just finished watching this movie and, for the most part, really appreciated the movie-making experience. Quick question: the movie opens with a (rather long) depiction of very obese naked women (almost circus-freak type figures), one shot after the other...from then on, I was looking for a connection between that scene and the rest of the movie - never caught it. Can anyone give me some insight into that director's choice? The only thing I did see was in one scene with Amy in her office, there's a framed artwork on the wall of an abstract obese naked woman. Help?"
" Secretly Philosophical
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,8,"I think IMDb doesn't give a good synopsis for Nocturnal Animals. So I'm going to give it a shot. A lot of people were disappointed with the ending, but you have to think about it for awhile to realize it's a sort of poetic/philosophical movie. The whole time everyone's telling Edward he's weak and sensitive. So he writes a book for his ex wife. In the book his wife and daughter are murdered by these terrible hooligans and the whole time he's trying to get revenge. He does and then immediately dies. Because of how well the book is written, his ex wife starts getting feelings for him again and reaches out to meet him. He stands her up and it ends. That's the movie. Sounds average. But break it down. The book is him getting stronger; it's not his wife and daughter getting murdered, it's Edward's weakness dying and his ex wife would be the murderers giving him reasons to get stronger. In the book, he spends time mourning and fantasizing about revenge. He finally gets his revenge and accidentally kills himself. How perfect is that? A part of Edward had to die to get over his ex and he wanted her to know. Now she finally wants him again and he's orchestrated this entire book/plan to just stand her up and prove that she's the weak one. Kind of a lot to process and maybe sounds cheesy, but I thought it was a good time."
" Incredible movie!!!
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,9,"This is a cinematic movie.Really.Every scene has a beauty in it,the colours,the poses...The story made me sad really.But I liked how it made me sad,the way was just wow..."
" Experctly directed! It lacked one more thing
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,6,"Or maybe not!In the end, this isnt more than a love story of a privileged woman. It has mommy issues. It has class issues. It has relationship issues. All with a woman and the way a woman deal or its affected by those.Its beautiful. The movie is just beautiful. It works. I don't know if resolves these pyshological problems as much as it presents them as if: ""Look. Rich people have problems too"". Which is fine, but Im a little more basic than that, and for this movie to feel more than good, I wouldve loved to have something more than reflection and contemplation."
" Tom Ford is obsessed women's fat arses

" Style AND Substance : Pleasant Surprise
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,9,"""Nocturnal Animals"" was a great film to stumble upon this afternoon. I sometimes don't shop for a film, but simply look at the title description and rating before diving into a film like this and wait to be surprised or disappointed. This movie was one of the greats as far as watching a film cold is concerned. Right out of the barrel, the opening scene gripped me in a visceral way, which is the intrinsic point of ""art"" after all. We see the gallery with the shocking spectacle projected on screens, which pan down to the sculptures of the subject as a reclining nude. The thematic device of the reclining nude appears several more times in the film, both as a horror and in the context of appreciable art and real life. I'm not going to ruin the film by giving a laundry list of what happens after that, but having watched the film, I must admit that the layered story-line, the careful weaving of symbolism, the transcendent tendrils of recurring imagery and an engrossing juxtaposition of timelines, where truth is stranger than fiction and art mimics life, really is composed as if with an artist's brush and it really gets down to the marrow of our daily existence and our psyches. The film makes us think about the choices we have made in our past and what we could have done to change the outcome. As a side note to the armchair malcontents, the likes of which we see far too many these days; get over yourself. The plethora of reactionary attacks of hatred unleashed upon any film that dares to be creative or different are unwarranted and quite frankly, despicable. If self-loathing nincompoops want to ""review"" something; why not review your own life? Yes. I'm talking to you. Most of you trolls who leave the imbecilic one and two star Reviews are semi-literate, immature, inadequate, spiteful, self-aggrandizing, pompous, contemptuous, unenlightened, spiteful, egotistical; as well as being the worst type of knuckle-dragging mouth-breathers on the planet and if tasked to make a movie on your own, could not do so if your life depended on it. If you hate movies that require any type of thought or creative consciousness outside the norm; just watch the films intended for people who are at the lowest point of intelligence on the Bell Curve and leave the rest of us alone. We do not care what you think. Sorry. I had to get that out of my system. If this movie was so terrible, as the oafs living in their parents' basement seem to think, then all movies are bad."

It has to be by far the best movie in 20 years .I'm sorry to say are we really that stupid America.Do we really need everything spelled out for us ."
" Totally waste of time because of the bad ending!!!
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,3,Disappointed doesn't guite cover it! Totally overrated!
" Beautifully directed movie with an interesting frame story
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,9,"'Nocturnal Animals' is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2016. Tom Ford did an impeccable job combining the exquisite soundtrack (kudos for Abel Korzeniowski) with the beautiful scenery. I am looking forward to seeing more of Ford's future work, as he seems to be not only a talented fashion designer but also has a critical eye for detail and artistic direction within his movies. As for the acting, Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal never fail to impress me. Nocturnal Animals is another proof of how capable they are to capture the audience's attention, even with the simplest facial expression. 
Another revelation in this movie is Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Having heard little about the actor, I was mesmerized with his interpretation of the story's main villain and genuinely hated him. Taylor-Johnson was perfectly cast in this role. 
Michael Shannon's powerful performance is another great addition to the movie. The acting might be the strongest part of the movie. Nocturnal Animals contains three main narratives - the story of Edward's book, Edward's and Susan's past relationship and Susan in the the present - We watch the whole movie through the eyes of Amy Adams's character, Susan. And Adams is capable enough to keep the viewers interested until the end of the movie. The storyline of Edward's book is the most emotional and captivating one and in comparison Susan's present storyline might initially start to bore the audience a bit. But the ending of the movie brings everything masterfully together and leaves us behind with many questions. 'Nocturnal Animals' is a movie that you should watch twice. As there are so many details and clever references that you might have missed during the first watching session. The wonderful soundtrack is another reason to watch the movie a second time.Nocturnal Animals is a must see for viewers who like to watch an engaging, well build up psychological thriller. Especially for fans of both Adams and Gyllenhaal this one should not be missed.

" Avoid it
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,1,This movie has absolutely no meaning. Its pointless and it sucks. Avoid it.
" Why does Hollywood always have to include negative comments about republicans in film?
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,4,This movie was intriguing but 48 minutes in Adam Adam's character makes a very negative comment about republicans. They include every negative reference possible as it relates to being a republican. Why can't hollywood just make interesting movies that entertain instead of slipping in their political agenda. Hollywood is the last place I would look to for guidance on any important issues.
" Everything but convincing
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,6,"The excessive privilege of Susan's world of artists and entitled people is a beautiful cinematic experience. If the story stayed at that level this would be a masterpiece. When she receives a copy of her ex-husband's book, she sees his metaphor for how and why she left him, and what it felt like through his eyes. We see the mother's warning about romanticizing someone who will never be the man she wants him to be. Her guilt over succumbing to social pressure, that's what she can't forgive about herself; that's what she says, but her actual relationship with Edward doesn't bear it out.
Her mother was right. She's in love with the man she wants Edward to be, but Edward - the real Edward - the man she's disappointed in and exasperated with? They have a boring, unfulfilling relationship and she wants out. The movie isn't honest about this detail and it's too important to ignore. She claims, later on, to have really loved him, and her claim is convincing. Even the husband she left Edward for, he cheats on her and she knows it, but she gets him because she has more respect for him as a man. If the director (Tom Ford) didn't mean to show that, it's incompetence. If her relationship with Edward was love, that's not shown, and Ford took a hard swing at it and missed."
" Revenge Is A Dish Best Served Twice
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,9,"An L.A. art gallery owner who's beautiful, affluent and seemingly successful is surprised to find herself miserable, disillusioned and unfulfilled. Intriguingly, about this time, she receives the manuscript of her ex-husband's debut novel and when she reads it and recognises its metaphorical nature, becomes consumed by feelings of guilt, regret and the desire to meet up again with the man who was her first crush.Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) and Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) had fallen in love as students in New York and the idealistic couple later married despite the opposition of Susan's mother who considered Edward to be unsuitable because he lacked the necessary ambition and drive to be a good provider. Susan, at this time, detested her mother's preoccupation with materialism but later in the marriage, became frustrated at Edward's lack of success as a novelist and broke up their relationship because she considered him to be too weak and not a very good writer.Edward's novel is a revenge thriller about a family of three who are driving along a West Texas highway at night when they get terrorized by a gang of vicious thugs, two of whom, kidnap Tony Hastings' (Jake Gyllenhaal) wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and teenage daughter India (Ellie Bamber), while the third gang member takes Tony to a remote spot in the desert where he leaves him stranded. Later, local detective Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon) is assigned to the case and together the two men eventually discover the bodies of Laura and India who had both been raped and murdered. Tony, who is portrayed as a rather weak man, becomes obsessed with the need to wreak vengeance on all the gang members and with Andes' assistance, does so very effectively.As she's reading, Susan reflects on the cruel way in which she ended her first marriage by cheating on Edward and secretly having an abortion when she was carrying his child. She also recalls him saying that ""when you love someone, you work it out. Don't just throw it away. You have to be careful with it. You may never get it again"". In the years since their divorce, she has learned that those words were true and that her choice of opting for materialism over love was misguided. She also recalls him saying, after she'd been denigrating his work, that ""nobody writes about anything but themselves"". This makes his story about a man who was driven to revenge following the loss of the woman and child that he loved even more poignant and moves her to respond positively to his suggestion that they meet up to discuss his book. This reconciliation, however, doesn't materialise in the way that she had expected it might.Based on Austin Wright's 1993 novel ""Tony and Susan"", this absorbing psychological drama is incredibly stylish, well paced and a visual treat. The ways in which the action slips back and forth between different periods of Susan's relationship with Edward and the events described in his novel are also masterfully done so that the coherence of the whole story and its natural momentum are beautifully maintained throughout.The entire production is well acted with Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal faultless in their lead roles and Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson (as the leader of the thugs in Edward's book) providing very strong supporting performances. There's also a wonderful cameo featuring Laura Linney as Susan's mother which makes an incredible impact, especially considering its very short duration."
" Reprehensible!
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,1,This is a film with about as much substance as the money-grubbing revisit of David Lynch to TWIN PEAKS. Vulgar and pointless.

" Over hyped garbage
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,1,An absolutely shallow attempt at trying to make a deep movie. Complete waste of time.
" Melodrama with Little Lynchian Coating
",2018-06-08 00:00:00,7,"Sleek, stylish, well acted. 'Nocturnal Animals' is fashion designer turned director Tom Ford's (with whom I wasn't familiar before) second movie. Visually beautiful to look at it, but it's actually more shallow than it looks at first glance - but that doesn't mean it's bad film. The structure of the film and how these stories are connected gives little to think over after the film is finished. Melodrama, mixed with tragic and violent revenge tale with little lynchian vibe. I love how Tom Ford used two different time lines and a (parallel) fantasy universe to tell one story. Interesting angle is that we actually don't meet one of the main characters - we see him only through other character's perspective. Acting works were mainly fantastic starting from to leads Amy Adams (she deserves another Oscar nomination for her performance), Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson.Ambitious and ambiguous 'Nocturnal Animals' offers wonderful visual storytelling with great performances and many ways to analyze the film. Not a masterpiece, but worth to watch."
" From an artist, but NOT art (or tasteful).
",2018-06-08 00:00:00,1,"I read most of the reviews before watching the film, and assumed it was just a bunch of uptight people from ""flyover"" states. I was wrong. I watched this because Tom Ford did such a great job on the aesthetic beauty/cinematography and tenderness of ""A Single Man""; assuming his follow up project would be similar (at least in style/taste). I could not have been more wrong. It was graphic and disturbing to the point that, had I not known Tom Ford had written & directed, I would have thought it was the product of a very disturbed mind. I still don't know what could have possessed him to imagine and write this. I don't know what the point of the opening sequence with the nude, morbidly obese ""art show"" was - it seemed like it was just for shock factor rather than any sort of artistic or body image commentary, given the fact Tom Ford made Colin Firth lose weight for ""A Single Man"". I don't want to get into any plot spoilers, but it made Law & Order: SVU look like a Rom-Com. I think the worst part is the sense of self-indulgence/self-importance of the film. There was an over abundance of drawn out ""reaction shots"" that just felt like a pretentious attempt at being artistic: Jake Gyllenhaal sitting naked on the side of the tub; Amy Adams inhaling overly dramatically long and deep while reading the manuscript (repeatedly). I really like Tom Ford and the bulk of his work (fashion and otherwise), but I hope that he either retires from filmmaking or once again embraces the thoughtfulness, sensitivity, and... ""spirit"" that made "" A Single Man"" such a bittersweet pleasure."
" Disturbing ..... and ultimately pointless.
",2018-06-04 00:00:00,3,"The opening credits feature some morbidly obese women dancing naked and it's enough to make you vomit. And I see not point why this is in the picture. The rest of movie is a study in strong violence and language, so if you like lots of ""f"" words and brutal violence, then this is the movie for you. And then they throw in some Evangelical Christian bashing directed it at Laura Linney's character and once again there is no point for this being in the movie at all. I think they tried to make a shocker like Silence Lambs or Blue Velvet, but it just didn't work for me."
" Now Jake will star in anything, huh?
",2018-06-01 00:00:00,4,"The good first. The movie did a very good job in slowly ramping up the tension and unease in the scene where some crazy men accost a family attempting a late night voyage on a mostly deserted road. Yet, you could see that in so many other movies.So its originality you're looking for? Nocturnal Animals strives in earnest to find originality. Therefore, for the first five minutes or so of the film during the opening credits, we are treated to two morbidly obese women shaking around butt naked in slow motion. Sorry to comment on their figure, but they were obviously chosen for that exact purpose, to be sensational. And then that scene really carried no meaning further into the film, other than to establish that our heroine and her husband worked with an art gallery.The slomo cellulite dance is never revisited, thank goodness, but the film ended leaving me with the same sense of ""um, why?"" that it began with. Although not hopelessly vague, I suspect less people would understand what point the movie is trying to make if there wasnt a sentence or two describing the plot of the film that people can read before choosing to watch it. And then even knowing what is supposed to be happening here - women regrets past mistakes and begins to wonder if the scary book her ex husband wrote is a veiled threat - is not rewarded with much of a conclusion.Jake Gyllenhaal's character(s) in the film also came across as... somehow not right for Jake Gyllenhaal. Dialogue marks him as a peceivably ""weak"" man yet the camera titillates over his muscular body; just a small example of the casting paradox that is also felt in other ways I can't describe. It feels like he is forcing himself into a role not written for him. Amy was alright playing the rich mopey girl, but not enough to call the performance exceptional. I give this a 4 because it didn't suck so much as to make me hate the film - I did sit through the entire thing after all. I just feel it deserves considerably less than the average rating. Tom Ford can make a good film, no doubt - so watch A Single Man instead. This one's more of a hollow art piece, for people who think wine tastes better when its in a fancier bottle."
" Attractive and well constructed, and yet somehow an underwhelming film.
",2018-05-17 00:00:00,7,"I did have my preconceptions of this film, which were based upon the mixed reviews of it. I had heard it was superficial, and yet others were lavishing praise upon it. The mixed reviews I confess attracted me to the film, and I wanted to see the side of the argument, I would come down upon.The positives first of all. It is beautifully filmed - it's slick, polished and the colours are luscious. It also has an astonishing beginning, which is one of those beginnings in where you go wow and are both 'magnetically' attracted and perhaps if you admit it a little repelled despite your pc correctness saying no you shouldn't be. It has a Lynchian quality to it and offers the promise of a quite wonderful and strange film. The other quality the film has is it's structure - a film within a film. The structure in itself allows for exciting ideas to be developed, and the film makes use of that structure to good if not quite, however, outstanding effect.One other positive, and it has to be said because so much of the film lingers on Amy Adams, is that she is quite simply stunning looking. This may seem like an archaic value judgement, and yet the film does depend upon her attraction to match the slickness of the film. Now this is a problem as well, because Amy Adams isn't really asked to do that much acting, and when the dramatic scenes come you are not quite convinced you care about the fate of her or the other people in the film.The film with in a film does however contain a fine performance from MIchael Shannon; a dying cop investigating the rape and murder of Jake Gyllenhall's characters family. Jake Gyllenall is also the ex-husband of Amy Adams who has sent the film script of this film to her. Therefore the setup is about how much does this film relate to Amy Adams relationship with her ex husband. Amy Adam's character is unhappily married as well, and therefore her ex-husband by way of the script (which by the way is good) reawakens a wish in her to go back to him. There is a critical problem however in that she aborted their child. This is revealed fairly late on in the film and adds a new dimension to the film with in the film.This though is the problem: does the film with in the film convincingly relate to the overall story. I wasn't really convinced because I didn't think there was an explicit enough connection between both sides of the film. The film with in the film to be fair would have made a good enough film on its own. The acting unfortunately is rather uneven throughout both 'films'. Jake Gyllenhall seems too intense for the role, and the film really needed to allow its actors more room for subtlety.This is a complicated and ambtious film and it is very well made, but something is missing from it. It isn't a purely superficial film, because there is depth underlying it. There are characters who are genuinely damaged, but the film ends up being more superficial because it doesn't allow room for the characters to be fully developed. I think the film's main reveal about the abortion comes too late in the film. It might have changed our earlier perceptions of where the film with in film was going and maybe this would have got me more involved with the film within a films meaning.This is a difficult film to review, and you have to see it to really understand, why people have mixed feelings about it. I admired the acheivement, but wasn't emotionally involved in the story. The film isn't a failure, but it is a film that doesn't quite work and it's ending is rather anti-climatic. The film just didn't quite nail it. ."
" Clever
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,8,"Susan, despite her art gallery business, is an unhappy woman in an unhappy second marriage. Then Edward, her first husband, sends her the manuscript of his forthcoming novel - a tale of a family who fall foul of three intimidating young men on a remote Texas highway - and she is soon tied up in the narrative and its parallels with her life.I don't normally have much time for art-house films, and this is clearly an art-house film. But it tells two stories, and tells both of them brilliantly. The events of the novel are delivered as a suspense thriller, and are cross-edited with Susan's story and experience of reading the manuscript. The editing is superb: it is as artistic, in its own way, as the film itself, where sound and image are carefully considered and crafted throughout.The crime thriller aspect is a story we have probably seen before, but we care - as does Susan - about its resolution. I found myself caring less about Susan's own story, the ""real"" story, if you will, although this gradually changed as the parallels between Edward's novel and his marriage to Susan became clearer. And this was not least due to the brilliant stroke of having Jake Gyllenhaal play both Edward and the protagonist of his novel.The performances are first class. Gyllenhaal, in particular, impresses enormously in both roles, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as chief tough is unrecognisable.It is rare to see a film which is so obviously an art-house film but which also entertains and impresses as a mainstream piece of cinema, but Nocturnal Animals manages it, and I recommend it accordingly."
" Intense psychological drama
",2018-05-14 00:00:00,9,"A return to the great film making of the early eighties.Intense psychological drama with an embedded murder thriller.The story within the story is gripping and heartbreaking and as it unfolds so the story of the protagonist's relationship the author of the murder story becomes as devastating and heartbreaking.This is highly polished screenwriting and directing, with consummate performances from all the players.I was tempted to give it a 10, but I just don't do that anymore. Nothing is perfect, but this film comes very close."
" The theme you must understand before watching this film.
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,8,"It was only after I saw an interview with the director, Tom Ford, that I understood the real theme of the film. And once you get that theme, believe me... you are going to love it. The goods are not going to look so good, and the weak are going to look powerful to you. If you want to know the theme keep reading, if not... don't worry I won't give any spoilers. Just a hint: remember the big painting, there is your theme. Don't miss this film."
" Horrible!
",2018-05-04 00:00:00,1,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever watched. I seriously want my time back!!! Poor written, no plot, no climax, no conclusion. Why?? Fix it Jesus!"
" Disappointing !!!
",2018-04-30 00:00:00,7,"*may be a spoiler or two*
 I know, I know ... you say ""disappointing"", but you rate it 7 stars? Well, that is simply because of some of the acting. Gyllenhaul, Shannon and Taylor-Johnson are great, and Adams is ""okay"" as the ""I don't want to grow up to be my Mom, but ... oh, hell ... I did!"" character. 
 This movie had a real story to tell, but, it ended up just being an hour of failed relationships, with 15 minutes of brutality thrown in. And, don't get me started on that ending! When everyone had a chance to ""show"" how they had ""grown up"" over the years ... they all show they were just their same pitiful selves (tho, in Gyllenhaul's defense, life HAD pretty much screwed him over)!
 This movie is fine, if you (like me) are an insomniac, looking to kill an hour and a half at 2:00 a.m.! But, otherwise, find some other ""will they catch the bad guys"" movie, or even an Adam Sandler comedy to kill the time. It will be time better spent."
" Wow
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,10,This film resonated with me for a while. A true piece of art.I loved it.
" Incredible Narrative Presented with Brilliance
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,10,"I wouldn't say that it was entirely necessary to BE an artist or a writer to fully appreciate this film, but I can say it doesn't hurt. That's especially true when it comes to smaller details, such as the significance of art works shown on screen and how they tie in to the overall story. I'm both a visual artist and a writer, so my review could fairly be considered biased to a certain degree. On the less ethereal side of things, all one fundamentally needs is one good and nasty romantic heartbreak to ""get it"" at least the meat of it.This is a provocative piece that tweaks and twists emotions as severely as it does visual sensibilities, but not gratuitously. It begins working you over immediately, in the opening sequence depicting an art exhibition and doesn't let go, even after its quite illustrative ending.The production is visually stunning, with strikingly opposed moods, tones and textures. A wide range of sensory manipulation is performed through these changes, in addition to their being used as cues to shifts in the screenplay.Some might say this is a story within a story, but it's actually more complicated AND more simple. I mention this mainly to correct the faulty description in the blurb on IMDB, and I don't believe this is a spoiler. The blurb suggests the main character reads a novel and believes it to be a veiled threat. But that is not at all what happens. The story follows a woman who has received a copy of a manuscript written by her ex-husband. The audience then ""reads"" the novel along with her. As she reads the novel, she begins to understand a number of truths about her life. There are three ""main veins"" through which the story is told (four, if you count the artwork), but it's all one story. Again - I don't think that spoils anything. I mention this as an aid to appreciating the film.It's one of the most impressive films I've seen in quite a while. Highly recommended."
" Once in a while a movie comes a long that...
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,8,"Wow.
That was unexpected.
 That movie messed up my mind. Bravo because it rarely happens. But this movie messed my mind. 
If you can go pass the first 5 boring minutes...and commit to finish it, you will enjoy a very unique film. 
It may have a slow start but it is worth it. Intriguing, suspenseful...you might not understanding it all the first time. 
Mybe there is nothin 'more' to understand...
In any case it is worth a rewatch that is a good thing."
" 1:54 seconds great, one minute lousy
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,7,"I gave the movie a 7 because it was great. My only problem, without spoiling it, cause it's still worth watching, but what a terrible ending."
" Nocturnal Animals
",2018-03-20 00:00:00,7,"Three stories take place concurrently: 1)Susan (Amy Adams) is a well-off L.A. art gallery owner whose second marriage is in trouble. She receives a manuscript from her first husband Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal) which she reads; 2) the manuscript story is played out in which a couple and their teenage daughter run into troublesome hooligans while traveling late at night in Texas; 3) in flashback, the story is told of the courtship and marriage between Susan and Edward.The opening credits are used against a backdrop that is an art gallery installation display. To put it as kindly as possible, this sequence can likely only be appreciated by lovers of modern art - or those who pretend to appreciate it for the sake of social-climbing. Otherwise, director Tom Ford has created a beautiful film with a cosmopolitan vibe with fabulous set designs and beautiful background music. He also uses clever techniques to switch between storylines.The Texas story begins with the perfect amount of suspense and tension. The trouble is that it is so well orchestrated that it becomes unbearable to watch the torment imposed on the young family. Within this sequence, Michael Shannon gives a standout performance as a no-BS law enforcer with health problems. He seems gruff but his heart is in the right place.There's a rather funny brief scene in the first story in which an art gallery meeting is taking place. One young woman is dressed in a way that makes one wonder if the rich really do have taste; the same can be said about another's choice in cosmetic surgery; a third one is addicted to modern technology in one of the worst ways imaginable, sadly resembling many people these days.While bizarre and uncomfortable at times, ""Nocturnal Animals"" still comes off as a film with style and skill."

Panned by the Oscars and most critics, this is one of those rare movies that given time, will eventually be recognized for its brilliance. This was, in my opinion, the best movie of 2016.Director Tom Ford shows just how talented and gifted a story teller he is with this film. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon give stellar performances. Amy Adams is devilish and Aaron Taylor Johnson gives the best performance of his career to date. The cinematography is beautiful and the musical score is breathtaking... with a Bernard Herman, Hitchcockian feel and sound. If you haven't seen this film yet, get on it! It might take you a few days to process it all and fully grasp the underlying theme. If this film hits you the way it hit me, hit will be on your mind for days."

",2018-03-12 00:00:00,7,"You can't really fault anything with Jake Gayllenhaal in it. He takes chances, and you can't tell before you're into the film if he is playing the hero or anti-hero. He is a wonderful actor, and in this film he is supported by Michael Shannon who keeps showing a great presence he is in films.Sadly the main lead is Amy Adams who I just don't warm too, and in this it's the same. She's just a very plain vanilla actress I find.Shame as what we have in this film is a good film that splices different tales as cheated on women finds some escape and torment by a gruesome novel devoted to her by her ex-husband. We go on a tour of emotions and fears, and one moment made me jump really out of my seat. It's a bonfire of the emotions for the rich yuppies in this movie, but it's also a dark & nasty movie.
 
Kind of reminded me of 'Enemy', another Jake Gyllenhaal movie, due to the themes. Both psychological dark tales.Again I'd recommend this. It's by no means perfect, but it's challenging and enjoyable. A few changes could have made it greater, but as it is it is still a damn fine movie."
" 2 stories in 1 movie .. How great !
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,9,"Nocturnal animals is a 2016 American neo-noir psychological thriller film written, produced and directed by Tom Ford, based on the 1993 novel Tony and Susan by Austin Wright. The film stars are Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Isla Fisher, Armie Hammer, Laura Linney, Andrea Riseborough, Karl Glusman, and Michael Sheen .
It's one of the best film i have seen in this year . Great performance by all the actors , fantastic imagery ,nice plot with a deep meaning and an extraordinary moral which every human can benefit from it in his life .
It looks like 80s masterpieces due to old clothes ..
True love comes once in lifetime , and we probably cannot get another chance to regret our mistakes and remedy our errors. 
I was really interested in how the producer could integrate two exciting stories in a one movie .. it creates a great work as a result ..
And i was extremely shoked by the last scene when the father kill the villain and revenge to her wife and her daughter , and susan's ex-husband didn't come and let her alone in the restaurant .
I really recommend the film to everyone because it's such a great exciting movie."
" A gorgeous and original film, both tense and dramatic
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,8,"8 +This movie has a peculiar way to tell its story, perfect in order to develop its main two characters and their tormented love story. I've probably never been more interested in a romance than by watching Nocturnal Animals, It is such an intriguing development that left me in awe until the end."
" A fantastic revenge tale with an allegorical twist.
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,9,"""Nocturnal Animals"" is a wild ride through the relationship of two people that are no longer together. I think this movie is brilliant in pretty much every way. There are so many details, especially some regarding the story told within the novel, that add so much to the overall story and it's a blast attempting to analyze them. If you're willing to pay attention and put a bit of effort into it, this film's enjoyment greatly increases upon analysis.The performances are all excellent, in particular Aaron Taylor Johnson and Michael Shannon (who, while I'm on the subject, is a national treasure and I don't think enough people appreciate him.) The scenes that take place within the novel are some of the most uncomfortably riveting things I've ever seen. A bit of a disclaimer though: don't go into this film expecting a generic thriller. If you do, you will be disappointed. In fact, the opening sequence should more than assure you that you're not watching a normal Hollywood thriller. Apart from that, this is possibly my favorite film from 2016 and I can't recommend it enough."
" Where is creativity to write a decent story line ?!
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,2,"As a fiction writer is see no novelty in recent movies that I watch lately. This included nocturnal animals. A good movie needs more than good acting. Or beautiful cinematography to pass standard measures of an average film. Jake Gyllenhaal is one the most promising young actors for sure. But this film lakes meaning after spending I hour 56 minutes. 
A family man (Jake Gyllenhaal ) lost his family violently and seemingly without any reason. A local low enforcer helps him to get trace two of suspects. I don't know what happened to the third one. It's getting more revenge movie type more and more. There are so many movies about murder, finding justice out of low, looking for relieve in vengeance. What this movie adds up to our experience? Just a desperate man finding a killer and yet is not sure what to do. 
There is a parallel story line about Susan (Amy Adams). She clearly has some emotional problems about her past. Mostly with her ex-husband Edward (also played with Jake Gyllenhaal). What does it got to do with the other story? In some points this film reminds of David Lynch's movie, lost highway. 
Why same actors appear in both storylines? What's the dramatic point of this? Who is who eventually? Is there any need to follow Susan's emotional conflicts through a bloody vengeance and nightmare like back story? 
What's a point of this film? I don't get it. Another poor script and loose connections whit events to form a general idea or something. I felt deceived after watching this movie and some many others like this."
" Another great performance by Amy Adams
",2018-02-12 00:00:00,7,"The best thing about this movie is Amy Adams. Is there anything she cannot do? The scene where she wipes off her lipstick is absolutely brilliant.
I recently watched The Princess Bride and The Fall, and this one is a worthy addition to the set. The story is built up very well, as are the characters. There are moments in there, when the tension reaches breaking point, you'll be transfixed by your own rush of emotions."
" Barely watchable
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,2,"The film itself deserves no stars; the performances in some scenes, thanks to a great cast - between 7 and 10 stars. But performances great story do not make, hence generous 2 stars for the entire experience.
The film is a story within a story (as if you didn't know that already), and is based on too many unbelievable premises that it is hard to get into it. However, being master of popular tastes, Tom Ford knows what it takes to take the gullable and draw them in: give them lots of empty space (as in - loooong shots where everyone is silent), frame it with style and let the viewer see whatever they want in it.
Nocturnal Animals is stylish, dark, slightly warped and so slow that moves at glacial pace. You can watch it with your finger on the FF button and save yourself lots of pain from waiting for ""what will happen next?"" It is also ""slow"" as in - stupid. Not a hint of intelligence in it. I would have to disclose some major spoilers, but let's just say that many scenes do not make much sense, unless we assume that protagonists have IQ in single digits. When a filmmaker has to resort to such tactics to move the story along, you know you are watching a terrible film.
All in all, a 15 minute story stretched to painful two hours, that left me entirely indifferent."
" Stylish, modern and mysterious
",2018-02-02 00:00:00,9,"This movie is different, engaging and intriguing. Brilliant acting. Jack Gyllenhaal never disappoints while Amy Adams and Isla Fisher are as beautiful as ever. Movie making at its best. It is Tom Ford's second movie that I have seen and I am very impressed and cannot wait to see more movies directed by him. Definitely worth a watch. Gave 9 as I prefer movies with a closure at the end but other than that, it is nearly perfect."
" Solid and enjoyable despite some flaws
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,7,"Wealthy art gallery owner Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) broker up with her ex-husband Ed Sheffield around 20 years ago. However, when Susan receives a draft copy of her ex-husband's latest novel she finds that she's unable to put the book down and finds it slowly consuming her life...Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals is a rather challenging film to bring to the screen; in less than 2 hours he's trying to meld fantasy,fiction and reality as well as developing a decent backstory for ex-husband and ex-wife in order for the audience to make an emotional connection. He mostly keeps the film on track and the challenge for the audience is trying to decipher what we're really seeing and what is playing out in Susan's mind. What really makes this work is that the story within the story is actually pretty compelling; although it is Ed's novel, what unfolds on screen is clearly Susan's interpretation of the material - it's clear that she feels a lot of guilt and pain for the way she has treated Ed which is perhaps why her vision of the novel sees him go through so much pain. The kidnapping sequence at the start is quite menacing (much of this is helped by a creepy and rather disturbing performance by Aaron Taylor-Johnson). After the event, Hastings ends up forming an unlikely alliance with sheriff Bobby Anders (Michael Shannon) who decides that he will take matters into his own hands when one of the gang is acquitted - he doesn't care as he has cancer and only has a year to live. I enjoyed the story within the story being played out on the screen, but sadly some of the 'real' world stuff in this film wasn't quite as interesting. The scenes between Susan and current hubby Hutton (Armie Hammer) don't seem to add much to the story - I get why he's in the film even though he exists as little more than a metaphor for infidelity. He may as well be wearing a T-Shirt saying 'The Grass isn't always greener.' I'm pretty sure the effect would have been the same if Susan was a single woman filled with regret rather than a married woman filled with regret and didn't appreciate the way that Hutton seemed to get forced in and out of the story whenever it seemed necessary. Some may also see the film as being a bit artsy-fartsy and if I'm totally honest I did feel that way to about this film at times. On balance though, there is definitely more right than wrong here and Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals will probably be a film that people will talk about and is a film that certainly lingered in my mind."
" Unpleasant but not in an interesting way....
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,2,"Bleak, mean-spirited, and misogynistic, if you ask me!"
" Tries to be pretentitious
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,8,"The over all film is quite good but it is very slow. A film with two plots (not one) should be more fast. I don't know maybe I don't have ""proper movie sense"".Well acted characters and the screenplay is quite innovative.
The scenes are just gorgeously put together and the references to certain tiny little things on screen such as the naked fat ladies in opening scenes and certain other stuffs in films shows director's vision towards narrating plot visually."
" More like a Nocturnal Emission
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,4,"This was clearly a wet dream for Tom Ford. Too bad it was a nightmare for the audience. So where to even begin? (Well, let's start by hosing off the director's splooge.) This is the kind of film that makes you wonder how it ever got made and released in the first place. It's also the kind of film that makes you yearn for your 2 hours back. It's unrealistic. Absurd. Boring. Mind numbing. (And those are it's GOOD qualities.) Do yourself a favor. You want nocturnal animals? Go out looking for raccoons rummaging through garbage cans. It would be more interesting."
" Deeply disturbed experience
",2018-01-20 00:00:00,7,"Nocturnal Animals can be described as many things; a wrenching relationship drama, a nervy Texas crime narrative, a character study of a woman divorced from her soul and, not least, a brutal condemnation of the kind of dehumanization so celebrated among the ultra rich. Though it is most certainly not terribly satisfying in any of its manifestations. Director Ford has made a film of many beautiful layers, in part because not one of them is strong enough to stand on its own. Having little to no expectations, one did not fully know what the film was about and the trailers did make the film look interesting though misleading. Overall, this is a rare film in which is smart and makes the viewers keep guessing. The tone is consistent from the start and the performances from both Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal are great."
" Night animals - the novel of revenge
",2018-01-19 00:00:00,9,"Revenge .. We all know retaliation .. But what kind of revenge and in what way is retaliation?
That is the main pillar upon which Tom Ford relied on his brilliant masterpieceNocturnal Animals.The film director Tom Ford is essentially a world-famous fashion designer because of his tasteful touch of the famous Gucci brand. Tom Ford is a famous name outside the film world. He has not produced just two films, this one.Do you think a man who drowns in the world of fashion and design and Tom Ford's global brand will be cut off from his important time to write narrative text and story and he is directing it to produce an absurd film?
If you think so, you are definitely wrong. Tom Ford has a terrible imagination that has many ideas and has the ability to implement and embody those ideas by portraying them as a film. This is what we know after the manufacture of the rare dramatic masterpiece in which he added to the original novel of his touch and inspired many of his own world as a fashion designer that mysterious and mysterious aspect of his life to reflect to us who Tom Ford is and how he thinks and how his imagination works.The film opens in an unusual way, displaying a kind of art that depicts the bodies of women in which greasy masses of disgusting disgust appear to be a kind of art that evokes and cares for a class of society saturated with everything and looking for strangeness in minute detail as a kind of Rare Arts. The show is run by Susan and her husband. The scene at first is closer to the description of the picture on which Susan is quite different from the taste of Edward her ex-husband dreamer full of romance, this kind of art shows the difference and difference between them.The film is based on three main axes: the one that moves through the film during the film, the first one is the present, then the picture novel and finally what happened in the past. These three axes mercilessly blend together to harmonize in a parallel way until the end of the film and here is also an added innovation to Tom Ford.The past: talks about a love relationship that arose between Susan and Edward and separated after their marriage because Susan believed that Edward was a weak man and his writing was about himself only, as Edward is a writer. Susan's mother also urged Suzanne not to associate with Edward, and Susan was impressed by a handsome man during her studies and wanted to be associated with him. Then she decided to give up Edward for her own reasons to hope for a more organized life without Edward and she miscarried his son without any convincing reasons with his insistence and attempts to maintain the relationship but the relationship ended between them and separated.Present: The life Susan lives with her husband, who preferred to be associated with him by abandoning Edward. A life where Susan runs her job as a manager of an art company and her husband. On one of these days, Susan received a parcel, a novel called ""Night Animals,"" written by Edward and given to Susan after their separation for nearly twenty years to be the first to read the novel according to Edward's wishes.Novel: Edward wrote a fictional story about him and about Susan talking about being married to her and they have a big daughter. One day, they decide to travel to Texas on a vehicle. During their journey, they are confronted by a vehicle in which three young men arrest him on an isolated road, kidnap his wife and daughter, rape them and kill them while he is unable to do anything to them and then decide to take revenge on his family with the help of a policeman.""Novel of Night Animals""
What did Edward want to write that hideous story that shows his weakness and inability to protect his family from the kidnappers and how she kidnapped Susan and her daughter and were brutally raped and then killed and dumped in the desert while he does not have the ability to protect them.
In the novel, Edward created characters who all have meaning. The three young men describe the thinness, deviousness, and laziness that Susan stole from him.
The character of the cancer-stricken police officer, Michael Shannon, is a character who describes sacrifice and power as a second figure to Edward, who was supposed to outweigh Susan's bad qualities and save their relationship but came late after losing his family.In fact, Edward genius, all he wanted from that novel is to activate Susan's memory indirectly and remind him of his deep love and deep into the depths and touch those feelings buried inside. He wanted to access her fear and manipulate her feelings and emotions. He described the novel as his love for her and the psychological damage he suffered after losing it and how his life became a tragedy, so he tells her how to revenge for her and how to kill himself in the latter because his life has no value without it and because of those shocks suffered.
Edward did not want to hurt Susan in a conventional way but revenge in his own way without hurting her physically but psychologically as she did in the past.
He does not hate her but he takes revenge on those bad qualities inside Suzanne. And also to tell her that he is a real artist who does not write about himself only as Susan told him previously and was affected by this, but this time write about Susan with him.He wrote everything so accurately that he took Suzanne's interest in her private life to think about the novel all the time and she was confused by the reality she lived in. She contacted her daughter to reassure her and was confined inside her room to complete the reading of the novel and began to remember her relationship and her moments with him. Recently betrayed ..
At the end of the novel, when Edward killed himself and was injured by his family's retaliation, Suzanne's heartbeat began to accelerate and I felt everything in his novel. I felt sad and her feelings moved again, awakened by details.
I came out of the bath in a scene that came immediately after the end of the novel as if he had breathed his love again and called his name involuntarily
EdwardHere Edward managed to reach his goal brilliantly but still wanted a final step

" A flashy movie that is ugly inside
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,3,"I found it designed to bring out one's worst emotions in an exploitative manner. I think it was trying to be disturbing and controversial, which it signals from the opening with a montage of obese elderly women dancing naked (which would be fine except that the intent was to portray them as clownish curiosities) but all it succeeds in doing is to force unpleasant feelings on its audience. The violence is particularly ugly and disturbing, and designed to incite impotent rage, which to me is a cheap trick. It's okay to deal with such material, but if it doesn't lead to a larger meaning and experience, then its purpose is obvious, it's a substitute for having anything meaningful to convey about the human experience. The pacing is also dreadfully slow, which is another cheap trick to simulate profundity when none is there. Which makes it, at two hours, at least a half hour too long. Yes, there is some good cinematography and the acting is highly professional and heartfelt (which is why I gave it 3 stars), but that should be a minimum standard for any movie today: There's a deep pool of topnotch talent in Hollywood these days. And finally, there are serious holes in the plot, with characters behaving in ways that make little sense, which added to my frustration and annoyance. I regret having watched it."
" Envy, hate and revenge. A movie about a book.
",2018-01-10 00:00:00,7,"Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) receives a copy of a novel written by her ex-husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gylenhaal). Why would an ex-partner, she left 20 years ago, want to know her opinion of his novel ""Nocturnal Animals""? The attractive woman finds herself confronting her past while becoming immersed in the story line of the book---about a professor's mundane life becoming dark and violent. This movie is well thought out and beautifully filmed. Dramatic and tense sequences. Adams and Gylenhaal can almost have you spellbound, but when you add someone like Michael Shannon...you have more than just a piece of misunderstood crap. Also in the cast: Isla Fisher, Armie Hunter, Laura Linney, Aaron Taylor-Johnsson and Ellie Bamber."
" Unusual Revenge Story
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,7,"I'm checking ""spoilers"" because the new IMDB rules consider anything revealing plot points to be a spoiler, which means you can't write anything meaningful without checking ""spoiler."" (They even now consider documentaries to be spoilable! LOL!). This is a film told in three concurrent sequences, one in the present day, one in the past, and one in a novel--but they essentially all have the same characters, even though some of them are disguised. It's a revenge movie, but more clever and complicated than most revenge stories. Although the film held my attention and was beautifully shot, ultimately it left a bad taste in my mouth because of the self-pitying nature of one of the characters plus a misogynistic opening scene that was in very poor taste. By the end of the movie I decided Tom Ford, the writer and director, has issues with women."
" Don't bother watching if you like satisfying endings
",2017-12-22 00:00:00,1,"I do not understand why people rate this so highly. Sure, it has a good cast, but it confuses the story lines a LOT, and has a very unsatisfying conclusion (until you go online and read a complete synopsis). It's one of those movies that when the black screen comes up, you say, ""the credits better not be rolling"", and then they do."
" Gibberish
",2017-12-01 00:00:00,1,"I guess I was warned. After all, I did read some of the other bad reviews. But I downloaded it on the DVR after a weekend of free HBO and gave it a shot. I'd rate it zero if I could. It isn't ""artsy"" or clever. Its a mediocre TV episode wrapped in a nonsensical story, neither relevant or related to the other. Spare me the ""you don't get it"" responses, because I'm actually glad ""I don't get it"". I don't want to get it...the movie is just stupid. Plain old stupid."
" Definitely one of the best cult crime movies
",2017-11-28 00:00:00,10,"Tom Ford made a great job over here. The music, the scenarios, the characters, the story... It makes us think about the decision that we made on the past and that we regret in the future. The seek for revenge that consumes our entire soul. The things that we cannot change in our lives anymore. Everything inside a cult atmosphere that make us think for ourselves."
" Not much to like
",2017-11-24 00:00:00,3,The actors did a decent job but this is a poor script with characters that don't elicit any sympathy. The ending is pathetic in its lack of resolution and leaves you feeling robbed of the time you spent watching it. Amy Adams' character has a momentary glimpse of humanity in one of the story lines but quickly betrays all morality. Gyllenhaal's character should be filled with righteous fury and vengeance but instead is just an impotent coward who never delivers on what he deserves to mete out. Michael Shannon plays the only character that anyone could respect. There is a weird quirk where in the cross between what's portrayed as the real arch of Adams' and Gyllenhaal's true relationship there was a daughter but it is so brief and poorly addressed I can't begin to guess if it was meant to be real or if it was just a device meant for the book that occupied more than half of the movie. It's a confusing and stupid movie that makes good actors look foolish for appearing in it.
" A movie you like the next day
",2017-11-16 00:00:00,8,"So this has another Jake Gyllenhaal weird ending. I guess he only likes weird movies these days. The ending obviously is the talking point of the movie. And it's kind of a downer.But in retrospect the movie makes sense, just not at the time. In my case, at the end I totally understood the parallels to the book he wrote and his life. That the abduction of the women was tied to the loss of his aborted daughter and divorce of his wife. And that he was angry about it. What I anticipated was that Tony was going to carry out the ""REVENGE"" in a similar fashion. That he was going to kill Susan's new husband or some other outrageous plan. But nope, it wasn't that exciting or dramatic.Revenge in this movie is kind of a bitch move. Don't show up to a dinner invited. Wow, what revenge! I guess for Tom Ford, being gay and a fashion designer for Gucci, this is the sort of thing that passes as outrageous revenge.But because I anticipated more, the movie actually was confusing at the end. And a huge downer. Oh, he didn't show up. The end. Uh...what?? But in retrospect, again, the movie actually is more satisfying. As a straight man it is sort of a nice revenge on a woman that throws you to the side because she's weak then thinking she can simply get you back not realizing what a bitch she was and how you no longer want her.The drinking of the whiskey in the same glass refers to who is the loser. At first it's Tony, then he gets his crap together, then it's Susan. Tony realizes that the only reason he was with a loser was because he was a loser.The one thing I hated about the movie was the opening. With the overweight women dancing naked. Ford says this is symbolic of Tony exposing himself creatively. I thought that was complete nonsense. If Tom Ford had been on stage waving his tiny penis, then I'd get it. Instead what it represented to me was a director/producer hiding behind his fashion, exploiting other people and their flaws to self-aggrandize himself. I thought it was appalling and Tom Ford looks like an self-important jerk. ""Hey look I'm putting myself out there, showing my insecurities...by showing other people's insecurities"". What a load of crap.The irony that a fashion designer who hides behind pretty women, not to mention sun glasses, has the balls to say he's that open creatively."
" Okay due to good performances, but often protracted and over-sophisticated
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,7,"I tend to like Tom Ford's A Single Man. I was not enraptured, but the leading performers were versatile and great, and so I did not mind to follow his second film. Perhaps I wanted some development regarding tautness, excitement - but, alas, I did not find. Again, the performers are good, if not great (particularly Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon), and parallel worlds enable witty and smooth comparisons and similar activities in different time and space, but striving for profundity and artisticness has brought along long static scenes and elements difficult to follow, to be read in the plot description later on. The novel is not too interesting as a thriller, and the real world is rather boring, forcing me to use forward-function from time to time... No, I am not into flashing lights and action chases, but seeing a static face for dozens of seconds without any event in the background - not for me either.Thus, I got ambivalent feelings, and I do not share the overall praise. Yes, direction is witty, characters distinct, but the two worlds do not form a smooth entirety."
" One and a half an hour brilliance + half an hour mediocre ending.
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,7,"This movie manages to deliver a brilliant start and intense plot development. The actors are taking their time to give brilliant performances. Actually I liked the police officer (Michael Shannon) performance the best. He gives a stunning performance as a taciturn western police. His features, reactions, and casualness mixed with the conscientiousness in the job is brilliantly natural.Some reviewers questioned the blurry connection between the book and the protagonists' lives - I say it wouldn't be necessity. That's how a writer is, he writes whatever he feels, and sometimes the story can develop far from his(her) own life.Some reviewers said the movie tries hard to deliver a strong message in the end - a culmination point. Perhaps they have a point. But I say the movie becomes average and boring in the end. Therefore, the hard-tried emotional culmination looks a failure.I wish the ending was a proper justice with hard-triggered squeezes. Especially the police character was ruined - just because he had a cancer, his personality should not become compromised.I enjoyed the movie, nevertheless."
" So much hate, why?
",2017-10-19 00:00:00,8,"I've read some pretty gnarly reviews and I don't really understand why. I mean, there was room for improvement but overall, I think it's quite a dark film when you really think about it. The idea that the car scene is a complete a possibility shook me a bit. All of the actors were pretty impressive, IMO. Although I must admit that Michael Sheen was a bit... awkward? Still trying to figure out what the point of him was in the film. The very opening scene was a bit much for my personal taste and I have no idea where Mr. Ford was going with that exactly, but I have awarded this film 8 out 10 stars because I do believe whilst it has many moments of ""privileged"" people having basic life issues, there's also the reminder shown that money really can't buy you everything.. namely, love."
" Slow ""B Grade Movie""
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,1,"What a waste of time this movie is. Slow moving, boring. Having said that, the acting is OK but very tedious waiting for the plot to progress. There are 2 mysteries here: (1) why does the movie start with obese dancers and (2) why do so many people assign 9 and 10 star ratings? Is it a generational thing? maybe the ""Millennial"" generation find the movie great, I'm a bit older than that and don't have the time for such slow movies. This movie reminds me of the the second ""B Grades"" used to show in old cheap continuous double feature movie houses."
" Pointless story within a story about cliché revenge movie
",2017-10-11 00:00:00,2,"The initial premise was interesting enough. A woman gets a manuscript from her ex husband. The manuscript is going to reflect their failed relationship. The story is about a bunch of west Texas raving yahoos who terrorize a family. It is a very poor mans deliverance. The script is so lame, it is obviously the ex husband's anger against the wife and daughter that had rejected him. That was the forty five minute mark. The rest of script plays out like a really slow revenge movie. Then it is over. There is no interaction between the husband and the wife. That really makes the story within the story completely pointless. It really hard to imagine that if you were given the opportunity to make a major motion picture, anyone would choose this story to make."
" How awful can a movie be?
",2017-10-11 00:00:00,1,"Take two genres, intermingle them a lot, and toss in every possible politically correct cliché you can imagine and this is what you get. Rednecks in Texas attacking poor innocent college professors. They don't mask or hide their effort, labeling Republicans as bigots and racists. It starts with grotesque imagery no one wants to see, then laments the fact the creator of this ""art"" is going bankrupt, but is redeemed because she hates conservatives and Republicans. What's to like there? Her previous husband sends her a book he dreamed up about a family being attacked with the mother and daughter being raped and murdered. Should we like this guy? Her current husband is screwing anything that walks besides her. Not much to look up to there ( well, maybe ). It just goes on and on, developing characters no one would ever care about. I can't spoil the plot because I didn't make it that far. The ""hero"" wimping out and hiding while his family is murdered was pretty much where I gave up caring about anything else that might possibly happen to this cast of losers. This movie is bad on SOOOO many levels. Don't ever pay to watch this for sure. And, if ancient aliens or crashing jets is on, watch that instead. My son forced me to watch The Room a couple of weeks ago. Trust me on this, watch that instead."
" That was disappointing
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,4,"Talk about two hours of my life I can't get back. This movie had some suspenseful scenes but that was about it. It was super slow in parts and didn't leave any impression on me. And then there's the ending, or should I say lack there of. Maybe I need my movies spoon fed to me, but I made no sense of that ending. I was actually upset at the end that I invested my time watching."
" Intriguing, but a bit disappointing.
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,6,"We've all had that book that we were addicted to. We read it every chance we could. Further into reading some of us even compared ourselves to the main character. Picturing ourselves as him/her and eventually may even find similarities to them. ""Nocturnal Animals"" was Susan's book.This film follows a woman named Susan who receives a book from her ex-husband. One element of the film follows the main character in the book, Tony and how tragedy strikes his family. The other element of the film follows Susan and her journey.The editing, cinematography and writing was pretty good. The viewer can feel the different and sometimes similar tones from Susan's life compared to Tony's life. The viewer can also understand the different emotions the characters were going through. The acting was spot on.Now I'd like to discuss what I think could have been improved in this movie. The screenplay is based on a novel by Austin Wright. I haven't read it so I cannot compare. I can say, to me, I felt like I was just watching them. I didn't connect with them. During the whole movie, my heart didn't race, not once. I feel the writers could have spent more time establishing ways the viewer could relate to the main characters. I also understood the concepts the themes displayed but I feel they could have been executed better.Overall the film is okay. At the end of the film I just felt, is this it? I wouldn't watch it again."
" Tries way too hard
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,5,"Sigh. Maybe I wouldn't be so disappointed in Nocturnal Animals if the trailers hadn't construed it as some twisted thriller instead of the character study it really is. Tom Ford apparently thinks his audience is too dense to figure the obvious out on their own, as he practically beats you over the head with his ""cleverness."" Firstly the film'a style seems forced which makes it come off as pretentious. There is nothing subtle about this movie. In one scene Susan is looking at a giant mural that says ""Revenge"" and talks to a coworker about it. I enjoy movies where you catch subtleties throughout, like why couldn't there just be a small picture in the background somewhere that said Revenge? I feel like every time something important was said or shown Ford felt like he had to point it out so that even the dumbest viewer could have it laid out for them. This movie is in no way a thriller. The beginning was intense, but afterwards I felt nothing for any of the characters. It was like both story lines were too uninteresting on their own, and Ford couldn't let the rest of us figure out in our own how the two were related. This isn't a bad movie, I just think it was marketed as something it's not, and doesn't deserve all the hype it's received. I think a lot of people just follow mob mentality, and will claim something a masterpiece just because that's how it was presented."
" Stylish, clever and intriguing film that needs a better ending
",2017-10-04 00:00:00,7,"Susan Morrow is a successful gallery owner. She is married to businessman Hutton Morrow, who is constantly travelling. She receives a manuscript of a novel, Nocturnal Animals, written by her first husband, Edward Sheffield. The gritty content of the novel strikes a chord with Susan and she starts to remember the times she and Edward had together. While this draws her closer to him, there are unresolved issues between the two.Intriguing movie that operates on two levels. There's the relationship drama involving Susan and Edward and the crime drama in the novel. The novel becomes the story-within-a-story, with, cleverly, Jake Gyllenhaal as the link between the two. Having Amy Adams play Susan and Isla Fisher the lead female character in the dramatisation of the novel is also a masterstroke, due to them looking so alike. (I only realised that it was Isla Fisher once I saw the credits. I had to go back to her scenes to confirm it was her, I was so convinced the character was played by Amy Adams).Unfortunately, the two levels are not created equal. I found myself far more interested in the novel's story than the main story. The novel was unflinchingly gritty and included a good revenge plot and theme. The main story was interesting only for the Susan-Edward backstory, and didn't really progress much, feeling more like wrapping around the novel story, without contributing much itself.There was still heaps of potential for both stories and the movie as a whole though, but the conclusion is a bit of a let-down. The novel ends in strange, contrived-feeling, fashion. The main story and movie ends quite flat. I'm a veteran of many anticlimactic endings, so very little tends to surprise me, but I was genuinely surprised when the closing credits started to roll. I thought ""That can't possibly be it"". But it was.A more profound tying together of the two stories and a punchy ending (to both) and Nocturnal Animals would have been superb.This said, there is still a lot to be admired about the movie. The novel story was done well and was helped by great performances from Michael Shannon and Jake Gyllenhaal. Shannon received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his effort. In addition, the Susan-Edward backstory was interesting."
" We need more films like Nocturnal Animals
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,10,"Nocturnal animals is not only a film about revenge, betrayal, loss, love and change, but more importantly one of the best story lines I've seen in a film. I am in no way an expert in film but that's exactly how this movie will make you feel when you're finished analyzing it...which i guarantee you will be doing for weeks after watching it. The story is simple enough but the themes and the messages are what will really spark the conversation and what turns it into an intellectual movie. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a beyond fantastic performance as always....i still am amazed that he hasn't won an Oscar yet what with his work in movies like Nightcrawler, Prisoners, Donnie Darko, Zodiac, and many more, and like with all the movies I've just stated, he has been robbed of an award for Nocturnal Animals. Michael Shannon, Amy Adams and Aaron Taylor Johnson were also exceptional and Tom Ford's stylistic direction was exactly what his script needed. I very much look forward to more of his movies for the future. Overall Nocturnal Animals is a refreshing original story that captures what its like to live and lose and is definitely one of my favorites. I highly recommend it to everyone because even if you don't quite enjoy the style or its originality it will certainly give you something to talk and think about hours after the story wraps up. We need more films like Nocturnal Animals."
" No words... a master piece.
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,10,"I missed the movie on the cinema.. so, i just finally could watch it, relax, at home, and what an experience.In this days of big Hollywood productions without meaning.. this kind of work is like fresh air. Awesome. I was watching and like.. Wow, like a new experience, when you taste a new flavour, that's it...I just fall in love with this movie.Thanks Tom!"
" Could have been better! 5/10
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,5,"Review: I was in two minds about this film because I found the Amy Adams scenes quite boring but the scenes played out from the book, were full of emotional drama. It also seemed liked a bit of a mess, because it goes back and forth from fact to fiction, and the two completely different story lines could have easily been two separate films. Anyway, the story is based on a married couple, Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) and Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal), who separate early on in the film, due to Susan having an affair with Hutton Morrow (Armie Hammer), who she ends up marrying. The film then skips 20 years in the future, we're Edward sends Susan a novel manuscript, ""Nocturnal Animals"", to get her opinion. The unhappy lamenting art curator, who feels unloved from her husband, delves into the book and soon feels emotional about the detailed content. The films then shows what Edward has written, with Jake Gyllenhaal playing a loving family man, Tony Hastings, whose married to Laura Hastings, and has a daughter called India. Whilst on vacation, they get pushed off the road by Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his gang, and whilst changing his wheel, the gang become violent, and they kidnap his wife and daughter. After getting ditched in the middle of nowhere, Tony finally finds his wife and daughter with detective Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon), who are murdered by the gang, in a violent way. When they finally track down the gang, Bobby gives Tony permission to take the law into his own hands but during a violent exchange, Edward is badly damaged. The movie then shows Susan, who finds herself recalling her first marriage and confronting some dark truths about herself. I must admit, this film does have the weirdest opening I have ever seen! Anyway, Jake Gyllenhaal was great as Tony Hastings, and Michael Shannon was a brilliant addition to the top cast but the flow of the movie was a bit strange. I can understand why Amy Adams played her role the way that she did but I still found her character quite depressing and boring. She used emotions more than dialogue throughout the movie, which were performed well but it was definitely the scenes from the book that made the movie interesting. Although I enjoyed half of the movie, I personally don't think that it was put together that well, and I was expecting a bit more after seeing the top cast. Average!Round-Up: This movie was directed by, the famous fashion designer, Tom Ford, 56, who gained fame as the creative director of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, and he launched his own Tom Ford label in 2006. He also directed a Single Man in 2009, starring Colin Firth and Julianne Moore, which was Oscar nominated, along with this film, so his 2 movies have been quite successful, even though it's not his main passion. He also wrote and produced both movies, so he really gave them his all, which paid off. In a lot of ways, this is a unique movie which touches on a delicate subject matter, which must have been a challenge to direct, so I have to commend him for taking on such a deep project. Budget: $22.5million Worldwide Gross: $30.7millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their crime/romance/dramas, starring Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon, Aaron- Taylor-Johnson, Isla Fisher, Laura Linney, Michael Sheen, Ellie Bamber and Armie Hammer. 5/10"
" Reviewers are getting the ending wrong
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,8,"The consensus amongst the reviewers here, and elsewhere, is that the last scene in the restaurant depicts Edward (1st husband) ""standing up"" his date, Susan (his ex). Everyone here is cheering on Edward for his sweet revenge. But that is not how it ended. You guys are wrong. Ed killed himself. Keep in mind, the film depicts updates on Susan's current day life with Gyllenhaal, while also depicting scenes from the book with the lead character, also being played by Gyllenhaal. This peculiar character coincidence is planned and helps to illuminate why Gyllenhaal (1st husband) doesn't show up for the date. It is because he killed himself in both story lines. Let's ask ourselves, why was Tom Ford was drawn to this story? Was it because of some ha-ha dating trick at the end of a script? No. It was for the brutal honesty of confronting one's mistakes and shortcomings that ultimately leads to an honor killing of self. Yes, dealing with suicide can be very uncomfortable. In fact, Ford depicts the event somewhat ambiguously, but if you rewind the tape you will see that Gyllenhaal doesn't accidentally shoot himself. It was a choice.Remember, Gyllenhaal is weeping at the end as he admits to those quick, yet monumental mistakes with the car chase, not defending his family, and then failing to keep the murderers subdued. Yes, he does kill the murderer on a 3rd chance, but after that justice is achieved, he ends his life as a self-punishment for the dishonor he brought to his family, self, and others. The cinematic beauty and talented acting deliver this message with raw beauty. Perhaps the Nocturnal Animals were more than just those backwoods road killers. Maybe Nocturnal Animals are the small failures in our quick decisions that give birth to animals that gnaw on us every night."
" Capturing.
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,8,"The reason I put a spoiler alert is because I wanted to notify anybody who is considering watching this movie that it contains multiple vulgar scenes including sexual assault and nudity. The remainder of my review contains no spoilers whatsoever. My first and general thought while watching this movie was that it is very ""well-made"". The story-line, the filming style, the soundtrack, and the acting were all a solid 10/10. The only reason I gave it an overall 8 was because of the loose ends. It was one of those movies where the screen faded to black before you expected it to. Other than that, it is well worth the watch. Jake Gyllenhaal's acting alone will make you want to keep watching. If you're on the fence about whether or not to watch this movie, don't listen to those who gave it a 1/10, and ignore those who make it sound like it's the best movie of all-time. Just watch it and decide for yourself."
" yet another 1 dimensional hick predator flick
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,5,"Other than the movie being set as the visualization of a book written by the main protagonist's ex, there is little new in this very normal, unpleasant, 'rich kids get jumped by sub-human predator hicks in the badlands of Texas', much in the vein of Texas Chainsaw Massaquere although thankfully it spares us the worst parts of the rapin' and a 'murdurin'.Amy Adams is almost uninspiring and quite emotionally dead seeming, and we care little for her callous disregard for her lover's feelings and hate her for her betrayal and abortion. She floats through the movie as a hot red hed cardboard cut out image against beautiful nighttime backgrounds. Like a vampire she appears to only exist in darkness. Jake G is also quite 1 dimensional as the guilt-wracked wimp who couldn't stand up to the bad guys. His simmering rage and wish for revenge is poorly delivered, and his stupidity in plot is enormous.The bad guys are your typical stereotyped 'back woods Texan hicks' who cruise around in their hot rod making mayhem like A Clockwork Orange yet somehow are never caught. Their homicidal antics stretch the movie's believability to the breaking point, even though we know we are not watching reality but some bad author's cheap hack thriller.perhaps the only saving grace is brought in by the excellent Michael Shannon, who plays a rich complex character of the aging police detective suffering from lung cancer and looking for revenge before he dies against the type of scum bags he's had to let go his whole career."
" Hollywood's Prejudice Strikes Again

I, like most people, want to be able to watch movies, sports, and other entertainment without enduring the liberal media's propaganda."
" What?
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,6,"So many times in film, they set out to make a painting. They seem to forget though, that it is a film, not a canvas they are creating. Such is the main problem with this film, or clunker. It is artsy garbage. From the first credits to the last scene. None of it with any power or depth. Just surface and vapid all the way through. The performances were ; Our lead actress didn't penetrate ... you can tell all to easily she is way outside her scope. I could feel her trying so hard and just not able to relate to this character at all. She was acting. Not telling a truth. Jake G was great, his performances are really outstanding lately. This film is no different. Mike what's his name as the gay friend ( or brother) was great. He is such a great character actor... I don't know why we don't see him in more. But overall this film fell so flat. Even the story in the book was outrageous and contrived .. this film is A by-polar mess. With no real message other than the one you heard in the first couple of scenes ... there is no mystery here, no feelings, no point or catharsis. It is just a day out of a horrible woman's life. One line stood out to me more than all the others. At the dinner table the gay friend looks at our viper and tells her , ""Our lives are so much better than everyone's else's."" I think that was meant as an oxymoron , but essentially he is absolutely correct. I don't think there is anything interesting about spoiled brats considering their spoiled-ness, do you? Being filthy rich is better than being poor. Period. Anything past that needs to be proved, and this movie didn't prove anything. Other than that statement in the end. This film is a terrible story, with awful characters and no feelings attached. Much like the cast of characters .. just empty. Anyone who sees anything else in this is probably lying. Seriously. Just thinking they should like it because it looks cool on the outside. Honestly I fast forwarded through most of it. The retelling of the book scenes - none of them worth the watch. They were so unrealistic that it was dumb. I guess the message of the film was that cold , driven and ambitious women are equal to murderous psychopathic rapists. Which again isn't even close to the truth, but there you have it. Duh."
" Emotionally charged, *possible spoiler*
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,9,"I love the layering of past, present and fiction. Amy Adams acts through her expressions, few words and an even tone. Jake Gyllenhaal does a great job in portraying his character, as well as his fictional one. Michael Shannon's character is played out so well he quickly becomes my favorite. I love the manuscript being played out, rather then in a narrative. The only thing that I was dissatisfied with was the ending. I'm simple in that I like a feeling of completion. Such an open ended ending left me feeling like the movie cut off mid sentence."
" The things that lurk in the darkness...
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,7,"Creativity is where the demons come out at night, and where you get to make excuses for your own impotence...I should know - I'm a wannabe writer myself, and some of the best pieces of writing I've done have been of the self-loathing kind.The movie is a kind of weird cross between ""Straw Dogs"" and ""Adaptation"", but it works."
" Really did not like this film
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,1,"All the boredom and gratuitous violence a person could ask for, and less! Plot A- Boring!Plot B- Horribly violent.If you can call either of them an actual plot. I don't mind violence, obscenity, the art world, abortion, divorce, hillbillies or even rape in a plot until you make it mind numbingly repetitious and gratuitous. Amy Adams actually looks like she doesn't want to be in this film.Don't waste your time."
" Visually stunning but vapid in narrative
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,3,"I want to start this review by stating that, yes, I understand that this film was meant to be deep and symbolic of the contempt that Gyllenhaal felt for Adams' character, and I will concede that, visually speaking, this film is beautiful and something to be studied and appreciated. However, the visual aesthetic of this film cannot make up for its lackluster narrative.Perhaps its the unexplained lack of sleep our lead is suffering from, but given her performance as her younger self, I find Adams' character as a whole bland, emotionless, and unapproachable. She denies being better than others, but gives off an air of superiority. Example, she pushes Gyllenhaal away until he finally lives up to her standards. This is not a likable character. Despite her crumbling relationship with Hammer's character, and her insistence that she cares for him, I find every aspect of her character insincere. Not to mention that he willingly entered into an affair with a married woman, and she's shocked that he would cheat on her in much the same way. Gyllenhaal,on the other, gives a great performance, both as her husband and as the father in his story. I think he did a great job with the material that he was given and really shines in terms of this movie. That being said, the scene in which he blows up at Adams' character for not liking the few pages he gave her to read mars his final revenge as petty instead of righteous. He handed it to her for her opinion, and threw a tantrum when she didn't respond the way he thought she ought to have... So I guess I should say that he gave it to her so she could give him HIS opinion. This is made even more ridiculous by the fact that her advice was that he not write about himself, and the book he uses to attract her wasn't really about himself.They also set up his character as being really sensitive and accepting, but he's SHOCKED when he finds out she aborted a baby she didn't want without his permission. This scars the fabric of his backstory, by creating problems out of something he had no control over. He couldn't tell her no, even if she had told him. She had told him their relationship wasn't working, and that she wasn't happy with him. Why is he so shocked? She was going to leave him anyway. Why would she, a liberal woman who hates all aspects of what her parents stand for, keep the baby? Her actions don't call for his response.Finally, Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor Johnson give great performances. Aaron Taylor Johnson was legitimately threatening throughout this film, and was genuinely unlikable throughout. Michael Shannon was absolutely stunning in his part, hitting all the marks; intimidating, passionate, understanding, you name it. It's funny that it should be the secondary characters in a film like this who really shine.I've heard some people complain about the opening credit sequence. As a woman, I didn't really find it offensive, or shocking, or 'blinding' as I heard one critic describe it. I agree that it wasn't necessary, but again, Tom Ford is all about style, and in today's film market, shocking=good. I wasn't shocked, I wasn't moved; it was just one more way for Ford to appeal to the 'style crowd' to distract from the shortcomings of the narrative.I'm giving this film a 3/10. If it weren't for the excellent performances by Gyllenhaal, Shannon, and Johnson, it would be a 1/10. This movie wasn't made for me. I do think this movie probably has an audience that will appreciate it as art, but the narrative didn't sell me, and, in the end, I was disappointed by the final product."
" woke up with this f~.#}|}#|##}##|g movie stuck in my head
",2017-09-01 00:00:00,10,"i don't know anything about tom ford Jake's filmography is so uneven and so is Amy's i mean you have prince of Persia or batman v superman and then you have gems like the good girl with Jennifer Anniston, night crawler and this one if you are feeling depressed and want to dwell more in it, that's the movie for you it doesn't feature any marvel or dc superheroes and its not a movie about the lives of everyday people struggling to make ends meet either it is what it is a movie about the ennui of a former Texas debutante facing depression, abandonment and a middle life crisis the thing is i got it just now she is the nocturnal creature as guilty as her accomplice, her second husband she is also the wife he loved and lost she didn't only kill their child she is dead to him maybe he is also dead inside even after twenty years like his hero in the end in his novel the murderers' punishment was murder her punishment is the life she leads he will not save her he will punish her by leaving her trapped in her golden cage of her own design because she killed the ideal and the love they once shared she is both the killer and the victim the novel is of course an allegory about the end of their marriage in such a brutal way that matches the brutality of the beginning of his book which depicts their brutal split and the prolonged emotional punishment he experienced he should have prevented it he should have seen it coming at the end of the day, he did not write his masterpiece he just wrote a typical hillbilly horror script but it was an allegory about her ""for Susan"" and himafter all, all writers write about themselves"
" Slow start but strong finish
",2017-08-29 00:00:00,7,"Nocturnal Animals started out with a very weird beginning and I thought, OK, this is going to be like Crying Game or Birdman - too artsy for mere mortals to follow. But once Amy Adams (Susan) got her package and started reading the book, this story grabs you and pulls you in.Susan is a famous art dealer who can't stand her job and can't believe people pay her to do what she does. She's useless, can't sleep, and in a meaningless relationship. With the story in a story technique, we learn that in grad school, she was married to Edward, an aspiring English major who dreamed of being a successful writer. We learn that Susan is from a rich background, somewhat spoiled, and somewhat afraid to take risks.Out of the blue, in her mundane daily life, a spark arrives in the form of a novel from Edward called Nocturnal Animals. We learn that this book and things in it have multiple ties to Susan and their past relationship. The book centers around a brutal, ripping event that takes place to a family traveling along the wilds of west Texas. Tony, the husband, is portrayed by Edward, and seems somewhat weak. His wife and daughter have definite similarities to Susan.Bad guys get involved and suddenly, there are multiple excellent flashbacks between current time, the story, and Susan and Edwards courtship and relationship. Excellently acted, excellently weaved together. I absolutely was riveted by Michael Shannon as this take no prisoners policeman Bobby Andes who is hard drinking, smoking, living type of Texas detective you might imagine.Detective Andes brings a focus of what should have been done to the story, and his strength counterplays against the weakness of Tony. His righteousness helps spur Tony to finally take matters into control, and highlights his terrible regret.Then flash forward to the present, and then the ending where we're left wondering about who really regrets what, and how people send messages about mistakes and choices.Nocturnal Animals would surely get higher ratings but for the silly beginning, and the pandering attitude to the whole art world. In the end, Susan lives in a world of phoniness at the same time as saying she's a realist, which brings out her true unhappiness. However, who will suffer more in this story - her, Edward, Tony, his family? who is who in the end. Less time spent on the art side, and more time spent on bringing out more of the book would have made this a masterpiece. As is, it's still a terrific story with great performances by Michael Shannon and Jake Gyllenhaal. Amy Adams was well, just OK, not outstanding. Really only at the end was she really given any scene to show acting skills. Otherwise, her role was a simple spoiled brat.Nocturnal Animals is not super violent, but it's not for the squeamish either - some tough subject matter. Enjoy,"
" Triteness as an art form
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,4,"I've read a lot of reviews here trying to learn what people see in this movie. I see nothing. Some people like the ""style"". In a nutshell the style is trite and pathetic. Looks like something from the 60s. The director is a fashion designer, I see. Good to know as something to stay away from. The ""story"" within the story is an unbelievably trite ""plot"" of the type usually seen in cheap ""C"" movies, having been rejected by all the ""B"" movie makers. It's just a cheapo effort to creep people out with the old terrorize the family on the road bit. When our non-hero fell on his gun and accidentally shot himself in the heart (an amazing contortion of his body – think about it), I laughed. I am a big fan of both Amy Adams and Jake G. Usually you can count on anything either one of them is in being very good stuff. Here, I just felt very sorry for both."
" Abhorrent Movie
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,1,"One word about this movie it's repugnant. OK, I have to put 5 lines of text. I normally don't even acknowledge a bad movie, this one is so vile I had to make a comment. It's my opinion. What's going on with critics, writers, actors? Thank the gods there are still old black & white noir movies worth watching. I need to go wash my eyes, face and ears out now, goodbye."
" Amazingly well constructed thought provoking emotional thriller
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,9,"I'm normally not into films that could be classified as ""emotional dramas"", but this movie was really good if you can make it through the opening credits which had me just repeating ""WHY... WHY... PLEASE STOP NO!""What I liked about this movie is that the sub plot of her ex husbands book could stand alone as it's own movie in terms of the raw entertainment value. I found it extremely disturbing, tense, and really just made me think about how scary it is that this kind of stuff happens in real life.Some people are just plain evil and I think this movie portrays a lot of what's wrong with the world both in terms of the physical pain endured by crime victims and the scarring emotional pain of their friends and family. This film ties together the most extreme horrors of the world in his book and parallels it with the much more common emotional traumas like losing the love of your life through a divorce. Although in reality there is obviously a huge difference between your loved ones being victims of a crime compared to getting a divorce... the point is that your heart may be broken or destroyed either way. Interpreting the exact details of how she feels in the end ""could"" be quite complicated I suppose, and maybe that's why some people don't understand the movie or they think it's pointless. But to me just watching the movie the first time everything made perfect sense, I was never confused and I never wondered what was the meaning of a certain scene or why was it included. I could be wrong but to me she deeply regrets losing and hurting the man that loved her so very much, but at this point it's too late. She is a good person at heart but ultimately too superficial, just like her mother the exact person she never wanted to be. Because of this she was unable to be satisfied in what she now realizes was the man she truly loved. She changed her life in a way that brought her great monetary success, but she lost the one who truly loved her and was happy to be with her (unlike her current husband). She will have to live with her mistakes, psychologically isolated and forever unhappy just like her ex husband. Realizing the future ahead of her and the finality of the damage she had done made her extremely sad which can be seen in the last close up of her face.I believe she wants to reach out to her ex husband and try to somehow make things better but now she knows she'll never get the chance. I don't believe that her ex husband wanted revenge on her by sending her the book, he probably just wanted her to finally like his work. All he ever wanted was for her to believe in him as a writer the way he believed in her as an artist. It seems very clear to me that he still loves her... the problem is that by this point he is so permanently damaged that it is hopeless for them to be together even if he finally wrote a (assumed) successful book. That is the irony, it took her destroying his heart for him to be able to create a story powerful enough for her to see his worth as a writer and fulfill her requirements as a partner(someone successful). The revenge was self inflicted and inevitable for both of them, for him he is so broken he can't even summon the courage to see her again, for her she can't find happiness no matter what she does and realizes that he is gone forever."
" The kind of thriller that doesn't let go
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,8,"The sign of a great film is one that leaves you pondering things about it like ""what was the meaning of this?"" 'Nocturnal Animals' is one of those films, as its dual story lines and multiple metaphors provide enough material to consider long after the credits role.'Animals,' which is Tom Ford's second directorial effort, follows the life of Susan Morrow (Amy Adams,) an influential art director who's living a materialistic life in Los Angeles devoid of true happiness, cheating husband and all. One day, Susan is sent a manuscript of a novel Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal), her ex-husband 19 years removed, has written. The novel, titled ""Nocturnal Animals,"" consumes Susan, and the deeper she gets into its pages - the events of which we get to see unfold on screen - the more she starts to re-evaluate her life and past choices.'Animals' is filmed beautifully. It's dark, yes, but in a way in which every scene is there by intention, not accident. The acting is top-notch, not just from Adams and Gyllenhaal, but key supporting actors like Michael Shannon, who plays a stereotypical west Texas deputy assigned to the case at the center of the novel's plot, to Aaron Taylor-Johnson, the living definition of ""trailer trash"" and main antagonist. And the soundtrack is haunting, which is exactly what you'd expect for this kind of film.But again, it's the plot and its endless mysteries that make 'Animals' what it is. If you're expecting a typical Hollywood thriller that is more or less linear and wraps everything up in a nice package at the end, beware - this is not the case at all. There are enough parts of the film that could be over-analyzed that by the end you think you've earned a degree in psychology. And the double- meaning of the novel and how it contrasts with the real-life (non-)relationship between Susan and Edward is powerful. There has been much debate about the meaning of the final scene, as well, and clearly there is no right or wrong interpretation. Again, the sign of a great film.Sure, 'Nocturnal Animals' didn't find much of an audience in theaters. But quality cinema usually finds an audience one way or another, so it's a good bet the same will happen in this instance."
" I only write quick and short reviews
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,10,This was Jake's film.And Ford's.And what I realized is.....it's better to be passionate than practical.And that Edward didn't show up for dinner because...Ed's dead.What a terrific - perfect - film.
" Good idea, terrible execution.
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,6,"I'm only giving this movie a 6 because of its fantastic cast, but they're wasted in a messy script. I found Susan's struggle much more interesting and intriguing than the story told in Edwards book. I feel like this film would have benefited better being a relationship drama about the rise and fall of Edward and Susan's relationship, but to add what happens in his book takes you out of it, because it makes him look like a really bad guy. Susan did some crappy things, but if his book is a metaphor for what she did to him, he's totally over dramatic. His actions in the film are just plain petty, especially at the end, and especially given how much time has passed. One could argue that Susan's current empty life is karma, but I definitely felt for her more than him."
" Pretentious. Don't try to guilt me into liking a turd
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,3,"This film is pretentious. But if you call it out for what it is, you are accused of ""not understanding"" it. I call B.S.""Ohh.. look at me... I'm so artsy... there are parallels and metaphors here.. you see, this symbolizes despair, and this other thing.. it symbolizes freedom.. if you give me a bad review, it just means that you're too stupid to understand what I was saying.""No. I understand perfectly well what you were saying. There's just no substance to your story. I would expect better from a sophomore film class.The purpose of a film is to tell a story.. to entertain people. Not to quiz them on their ability to pick up on metaphors. The only useful thing that this film does is give idiots a springboard to say ""Oh! I figured it out! I'm so smart!"""
" Great film
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,8,"Nocturnal Animals introduces three stories: one is present day reality, the second one is a flashback of past memories, and the third one is a fictional story written by one of the main characters. These three stories are excellently woven together, and together they add up to a movie that, I think, is one of the best ones of 2016. The fictional storyline rises above the rest of the movie, especially because of two magnetic performances by Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. The dialogue and the acting in this particular part of the movie is really-really good (better than in the other two story lines), it got me totally invested in the characters and the story. The cinematography and the editing throughout the whole film is outstanding. I don't want to spoil anything, so I will only say: If you like a good thriller/drama that will also make you think about things such as life, regrets, relationships, you will probably like it."
" All gloss, No substance
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,2,"I chose to watch this movie because it received decent reviews and was advertised as a taut psychological thriller. Sadly, the only emotions it managed to summon were frustration and disappointment.Pros: The cinematography is lovely. Michael Shannon is very strong in a role that ends up going nowhere and is inconsequential to the ""resolution"" of either the main or secondary story.Cons: The story thread that is meant to be the main plot goes absolutely nowhere. I am personally of the opinion that Amy Adams is a competent actress who is nowhere near as strong as the accolades she has received suggest, however she is better than this movie. She is given little to do other than look numb and/or sad. Oh, and spend a good deal of time in or under water, which is either symbolic that she is drowning in her life or that we are drowning in pretension. Her character is so unlikable that you spend most of the movie hoping that this drudgery is at least leading up to some wicked revenge or plot twist. It isn't. I won't give away the ending, but it is not even remotely satisfying.Jena Malone is also wasted in a one-scene role where her sole purpose appears to be to wear something edgy and to point out that the main character is so numb and stupid that she doesn't remember what paintings she purchased (in some very obvious foreshadowing, a painting of the word REVENGE.The ""art"" in the movie is eye-rolling and I'm not sure what the director was trying to achieve with most of it. It just felt self-important and unnecessary.Bottom line, this movie left me feeling unsatisfied and a little icky. View at your peril."
" a disjointed film that weakly ties together a story within a story.
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,2,"There are two stories here, one about a woman who turned down love for riches and regrets it later, and another about a family who encounters tragedy at the hands of a group of criminals on the road. the story about the family seems like it was almost well done but was too short to make a film so they threw in some garbage about the guy writing it and his ex-wife. I think this is some revenge flick that a writer used to smear his ex in literary fiction because he had personal issues. The ending falls flat on it's face as it trails off which is a middle finger to anyone that was interested in the ex-wife's story.TL;DR: Rent it, Watch only the family story line and fast-forward through the ex-wife and writer story line. Maybe you'll enjoy it then as a short film about what not to do on the back roads at night."
" Pretentious embarrassment.
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,1,"I caught this on HBO and glad I did not waste good money on it. What a load of pretentious horseshit. This is a film that wastes the talents of some very good actors. Not once did I believe the story line (or lines) running through it. It is one of those movies that make you feel sorry for the actors who participated in this Tom Ford ego trip. Amy, Jake and Michael should sue their agents for agreeing to do this one. The whole thing seemed staged and predictable, appealing only to naive film goers who want to appear hip."
" Worst Movie Amy Adams has been in !!!!
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,7,This is one of the most confusing movies I have ever seen !!! This story within a story does not because both Jake and Amy's characters look the same after 20 years apart. The only version is the old Jake had a Beard. I've read different interpretations of the ending; I have one of my own ....... Jake does not show up at the restaurant because at that same moment he is Killing the rapist's of his wife and daughter and dying in the process..... the film goes back and forth between Amy in the bathtub and Jake in the desert bleeding to death after murdering the rapists as in the background it sounds like a heartbeat. This movie is so confusing it needs a road map !!!!!
" typical contemporary dystopian film
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,1,"Why?! Just a bad dark film, often times almost funny when it is trying to be serious. Also a story within a story and both are just a sad commentary on today's society. The acting was also subpar and there was no connection to any character. What man would just let his wife and daughter be taken without an all out fight? Just pathetic, all the way around, and great ending, at least we know none of these horrible characters have a future."
" Are You A Man Or A Jellyfish?
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,7,"Now, more than ever, Americans seem to be thinking in binary terms. Something must be either ""good"" or ""bad"", with nothing in between. That appears to be the response to Tom Ford's ""Nocturnal Animals."" It must be either an artistic breakthrough or a mess of pointless pomposity. I thought it was pretty good.The film opens with a naked and flabby old lady doing a dance. (Okay, I didn't get that part.) Then we meet Amy Adams, perhaps plumper than we remember, her pale mask-like face all garish with make up, half hidden by a perfectly groomed, perfectly dyed cascade of hair. She's an executive at a tony art gallery or something, sits in on meetings and voices her opinions decisively. She has a doctorate in fine arts from Columbia. We learn she comes from a pretty hoity-toity family. If we didn't know it before, we find out soon enough from her mother, Laura Linney in a terrible wig, who makes it plain that Adams and her boyfriend, Jake Gyllenhal, are not made for each other. Adams is strong willed while Gyllenhal, who is no more than a novelist manqué attending Columbia on a scholarship, is a weakling.And therein lies the tale. (I think.) After creative differences, Adams and Gyllenhal split up. But years later she receives a typed manuscript from Gyllenhal, a novel dedicated to her and entitled ""Nocturnal Animals,"" a title into which we should feel free to add whatever meanings we like. She begins reading the novel, a story about Gyllenhal and herself, no married and with an adolescent child, driving through the barren countryside of West Texas at night, being bullied off the road by a car full of greasy rednecks, teased and humiliated abominably, then kidnapped, with the two females ending up raped and brutally murdered, and Gylenhall wandering around among the creosote bushes until he finds a dying cop who, when the law fails them, manages to present Gyllenhall with the opportunity to shoot two of the men who abused his family.So does he shoot them? It depends partly on exactly how ""weak"" Gyllenhal is, and even more so on exactly what we mean by ""weak."" I can understand why some viewers might be annoyed. Tom Ford and his editor have gone ape. The framing story, in which Adams is reading the manuscript, is clear enough but then there are quick cuts to scenes taking place in the novel, then more quick cuts to Adams and Gyllenhal's first meeting in New York, then other quick cuts to their disagreements, then to scenes of Adams with her new mate, and -- well, it just makes you long for those old movies in which a harp played while pages were blown one by one from a calendar.Speaking of harps, the score by Abel Korzeniowski owes a considerable debt to Bernard Herrmann without being in any way a rip off. The photography is by Seamus McGarvey and is peerless. Really, it's beautifully shot. Not just because of the occasional rosy cloud formations but because of the precision with which the atmosphere of each scene is evoked. Sure, it's California and the Mojave, but it couldn't look more like Texas if it tried.The performances can't be faulted either, except for the few times when Gyllenhall's fictional character screws up his face and begins to weep with agony and indecision. I mean -- we already know what he's feeling. A hint would have done as well. Let's not paint the lily. Everyone is up to professional standards but the roughnecks who kidnap the family are superbly drawn, and Michael Shannon is the laconic sheriff expiring of lung cancer and he's unforgettable.Some people have said the whole movie is pointless but I don't know why. Towards the end Adams receives an invitation to meet her estranged husband for dinner at a restaurant. The note is signed ""Edward"", the name of Gyllenhal's character in the novel. She sheds most of her make up, dresses unostentatiously, and sits quietly at a restaurant table, drinking scotch, and waiting for Gyllenhall to show up so they can begin again. Evidently she thought it was the kind of novel that couldn't have been written by a jellyfish."
" A Decent Film
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,7,"Amy Adams, art gallery owner, receives a proof of manuscript of her ex-husband Edward and an invitation for dinner during Edward's upcoming visit to Los Angeles. Amy is in a deteriorating second marriage to an unfaithful, so she becomes consumed by Edward's novel that is dedicated to her. The film switches to a teleplay of Edward's novel. Tony, a peaceful man, during a road trip through West Texas with his wife and daughter, accidentally rearends three rural redneck 20-somethings – and the self involved brat daughter stupidly flips the bird at them – the dirtbags force Tony, his wife and daughter in their late model Mercedes off the road, flattens their tire, beats Tony molests his wife and daughter. Then kidnaps his wife and daughter and leaves him with Lou, one of the young rednecks. He makes Lou drive the rednecks car to the end of a dirt road where he gets away. Tony manages to evade them goes to a dingy farmhouse and calls the police. With a detective, Tony, discovers the bodies of his mutilated, dead wife and daughter in the wilderness, raped and murdered. Tony is beyond pain feeling guilty for not protecting them. A year later he's asked to identify one of the rednecks, who is charged as an accomplice in the murders. The other one was fatally shot in a botched robbery, and the last one is brought to justice, but ultimately released due to circumstantial evidence. Faced with terminal lung cancer, the detective, with Tony's help, takes matters into his own hands and abducts the dirtbags and shoots one of them, but the other one gets away. Then Tony tracks him down on his own to the shack where his wife and daughter were killed and the dirtbag admits to raping and murdering Tony's wife and daughter, calling him weak. So he shoots and kills him, but is blinded when the dirtbag hits him on the head with an iron bar. Tony stumbles outside, succumbing to to a brain hemorrhage, and dies after falling on his gun, shooting himself in the stomach.Now back in the real world, Amy Adams is so shocked by the raw emotion of her ex husband's new novel, reminisces about meeting him in college and falling for him, but (done better by Ryan Godling and Rachel McAdams in 2004 The Notebook) Amy's domineering mother objects to him, claiming that he's unworthy of Amy's affections and that he's too romantic and worldly, lacking the drive to actually achieve his goals She ignores her mother and ultimately marries Edward.Of course, She has a troubled marriage with Edward, who cannot handle her frustration with his fledgling career and her dismissive attitude towards his literary aspirations, and so she cheats on him with another man ultimately divorcing Edward to marry the man. Edward attempts to repair their relationship, but ultimately cuts the cord with Amy when he learns she's pregnant with his child but secretly had an abortion to ensure the divorce would proceed. So, after reading Edward's new novel she arranges a meeting with Edward at a restaurant, but Edward doesn't show up, as he stand's her up for revenge. So she realizes he's a good writer after all and she's stuck in a sham and unhappy with her life. Michael Shannon (pre General Zod in Man of Steel) is incredible as a terminally ill Texas detective. And Prince of Persia Jake Gyllenhaal is way better than anything I've seen him in lately - thank Jesus he shaved off the gross facial hair for the flashbacks. And Amy Adams plays typical lovelorn damsel as always. But I realize Tom Ford lives in this luxurious world of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, with beautiful faces and bodies. But its no excuse to occasionally throw in pointless gratuitous nudity - Jake in steamy shower scenes and Aaron Taylor Johnson outside on a toilet. I'll still be grateful for Tom Ford's A Single Man. Amazing how Nocturnal Animals is his next film 7 years later."
" Any time any place
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,6,"Amy Adams (Susan) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Edward/Tony) give us great performances in a rather subdued script which consists of a story within a story. Susan has a failing art gallery that shows contemporary art of questionable quality. She comes from wealth. Her second husband Hutton (Armie Hammer) displays signs of having an affair, although this is never confirmed one way of the other. What is clear is that the couple has fallen apart as Susan drifts into melancholy. She receives a manuscript from her first husband Edward, a wannabe author. She reads the manuscript and sees Edward as the lead character Tony and similar people as herself and daughter for their roles. The book is shown to us as a subplot of the film. It is strictly ""B"" film material of a car jacking in west Texas, but she loves it. We are also fed flashbacks of Edward and Susan and we also see the overly made up Susan in the present in her 40's.Yes, the film has a point, one that is visual and read into the face of Amy Adams at the end...excellent acting and directing. In spite of all the praise, I didn't feel entertained, as I kept waiting for something real to happen, as the most telling scene was the board meeting when Susan seems to have a change of heart, perhaps the climax of the production. Not for me, although artsy people may love it.Guide: F-word. Naked man sitting on toilet, although no genitals show. Implied rape. No real sex or nudity."

Jake Gyllenhaal? Still can't believe that people made this trash of the movie with these actors.In the beginning it really had some potential,the atmosphere was tense,i was waiting for something to happen.Didn't lose hope til the last minutes of it.I've seen really bad movies,with dumb acting,dumb plots and many more dumb things,but this...It felt like watching an empty wall for ten hours.10 days after this one i couldn't recover and turn some other movie on.First and last Tom Ford's film!"

" Hard to rate and classify...
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,5,"In any case, we can say that it caused an amazing discussion among us at the end of the movie! We were three, two guys and one girl, who watched Nocturnal Animals, and when appeared the words ""the end"", we had three different versions of what could be the explanation to be given to this strange business! Admittedly, it's true that several pieces were not understood by us during the movie, or at least had not caught all our attention when it had appeared. In spite of the pretty poor rate I gave to this movie, it will be necessary for me to Watch it again, one of these days to miss nothing this time - As it is in The Sixth Sense.

" The Movie company are voting this up.
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,1,7.5 for this utter drivel - I smell a campaign from the movie company.What an utterly pointless load of excrement this film was.Other than showing off equally ludicrous haute couture from the director there was absolutely no reason to make this.Quite what the stars in this were thinking when they sign up we will never know - probably money.
" Makes me want to read the source book
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,4,"This review contains spoilers. I didn't much like this movie. I was really bothered by at least two choices the director made. I disliked the irrelevant and gratuitous opening scenes of naked fat women. Reminded me of the hatefulness and misogyny of a circus side show. What was the artistic point? I also thought that casting the same actor to play two roles was childish. Was director Ford afraid that we wouldn't see the that the novelist Edward had a main character in his book (Tony) to whom he related deeply? (A minor complaint of mine was the paper cut, telegraphing to us that this package was going to really, really hurt Susan.)I'm a rabid Michael Mann fan, and I did very much enjoy the stylish city lights at night shots.I did enjoy the story within a story - Edward's novel. Every man I know can relate to the self-loathing that would come from being unable to protect one's family from more-primitive males. Straw Dogs, anyone? Neither did I think the crimes in Edward's novel were far-fetched. Road rage nightmares have become too common in our real lives, and women are sexually assaulted all the time. I might have gotten the central point sooner if I knew Edward had learned of Susan's abortion. (He must have, right? And yet we didn't see that, right? Or did I miss that?) Anyway, his fictional hero loses his wife and child, and Edward reminds Susan that he, too lost a wife and child - by her actions. I (finally) didn't like the ending, either. Seems trivial to invite Susan to dinner and then not show up. Edward has already ""gotten even"" with Susan by writing the novel. That dinner table scene was purely for our benefit, to make sure we hadn't missed the point that Edward was settling scores."
" Rating: A-
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,8,"Do you like movies that expect you to be fully concentrated throughout it and that make you think hours after it ended? Well, that's Nocturnal Animals. A lot of people disliked this film because of it, so I'm saying it to you straight: if you don't like watching movies that leave you with a bunch of unanswered questions and that expect you to solve them, then forget it, this isn't a movie for you ...The narratives are so well-constructed, Tom Ford directed this movie brilliantly. The production design is amazing with all the visual cues and the editing is excellent (it increases the confusion purposely). The story within the story is obviously the most captivating and fascinatingly dark. So dark. It's unbelievably tense, emotional and Tom Ford does a great job connecting them all (even if he's sloppy and pretentious at some points).The casting is one of the best of 2016. Amy Adams is very good (better in Arrival), but the biggest praise goes to Jake Gyllenhaal (also plays Tony Hastings), who continues to be ignored even when he's one of the greatest actors of his generation and he keeps proving that over and over again ... Wake up, Hollywood! Michael Shannon (Bobby Andes) is absolutely perfect and an Oscar nomination is more than deserved, as well as Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Ray Marcus), who looks so, but so much dark and creepy that I started to feel disgusted just by looking at him, which is a great compliment since that's what he's supposed to make me feel.It's really a great movie, it's very different and unconventional (a lot of people are going to hate it as they hated Swiss Army Man, just because they don't follow the common path) and the opening scene alone ... Well, it might be the biggest shock in the entire film for some people. There's an open ending, so a lot of internet theories were already created, but I suggest you think by yourself and try to make sense of all of it. There isn't a solution for this film ending, it depends on the interpretation of each viewer, so think. Just think.The only issues I find with this film are, as I said above, the excessive visual cues that Tom Ford sometimes gets a little too pretentious and sloppy using them and the fact that the book's story is so captivating that takes away some interest in the others. Also, even if mostly well done, he doesn't always get a cohesive connection between the narratives, especially when he tries to compare them all together.However, Nocturnal Animals is a great unconventional film with amazing narratives that connect with each other (mostly) well. The cast is ridiculously good with major praise to Gyllenhaal and Sheen, and Tom Ford's directing is wonderful, even if sloppy at points. This is a dark and tense film that leaves us thinking of all the unanswered questions and the captivating story that I can't wait to rewatch.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"

" Nocturnal Animals - an analysis
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,7,"Hello, dear reader - if by some miraculous coincidence you stumbled upon this review, hidden among others.This will actually be more of an analysis. Two friends had me explain WHAT THIS FILM WAS EVEN ABOUT when they saw I liked it on Facebook. I've also noticed that - as with many art-house movies -- reviews vary from ""A masterpiece!"" to ""This is about NOTHING"". I understand - a lot of films I myself don't get at all or I don't think they deserve the hype. ""Nocturnal Animals"" I get pretty well though, and I can tell you for sure it's not about nothing. So I'll share my thoughts.Spoilers ahead, read after you've watched the film.1. Who is Susan? This movie is best to watch putting yourself in Susan's shoes. You don't have to like her, but you have to understand her. That's especially important when it comes to analyzing Edward's book, since it's obvious that the events from the book that we see on-screen are filtered through her mind. We get drawn into the fictional world when she starts reading and come back whenever she stops.So, who is she? For me Susan is, first and foremost, a person who doesn't fit anywhere.She's pragmatic and cynical, and she knows it. She doesn't like it about herself though; rather she's resigned to accept it. So when as a grad student she bumps into Edward - her brother's childhood friend and her teenage crush -- who infectiously believes she can be more than that, she falls into his arms.One manifestation of what she escapes is the story of her brother. He's gay; their parents have practically disowned him; Susan hates them for it. She tells Edward that her brother once had a crush on him - his reaction: ""I should call him more often"". His different, soft, human approach is what draws her to him.On the other side stands Susan's mother. She's stern and dogmatic but she loves her child. She immediately knows that Susan and Edward aren't right for each other. She warns her daughter that ""We all eventually turn into our mothers"", and that when Susan's organized nature starts showing, she'll hurt Edward.Later it turns out she was right. Edward insists writing is his calling, but he isn't any good. Susan eventually stops believing in him. She needs stabilization. She leaves him for another man, Edward's complete opposite. She aborts Edward's child.But then it turns out she suffocates in her new neat life, too. Her only constant: she doesn't fit. Whomever she's with, she suffers from insomnia (the ""nocturnal animal"", Edward once called her).These are the opposites Susan fluctuates between: chaos and order; Edward's softness and pragmatism that runs in her blood.2. The book. What does Edward say to Susan? However Susan understands the book is indicative of what she thinks Edward wants to communicate with it. So it hints at what happened between them in the past, a lot earlier than the film actually spells it out. Prepare to watch Susan's reactions and then put the puzzles together through her flashbacks.Only after seeing the end do you realize what game Edward was playing all along.He gave the book a title that was their private joke, then dedicated it to Susan. She knew the book was about him -- he'd never stopped ""writing about himself"" when they were together. (That's why she saw Tony as Edward and why Gyllenhaal played both roles).Edward knew Susan felt guilty for what she's done. For a long time after she must have identified Tony's family harassers as the eponymous animals - her counterparts in the book - he kept her uncertain of their intentions. Will they hurt the family? Will they leave them alone? Finally, they killed them, as Susan destroyed her and Edward's relationship and aborted their child. Edward portrayed Tony's grief, letting Susan know: ""Here's what you did to me"". Then he expanded on Ray Marcus -- a mindless psychopath -- sending the message: ""Here's what you are to me now"". Finally, Tony kills Ray and dies himself, which means: ""Writing this killed me, but at least now you're dead too"".Edward's revenge might seem childish. But it shows what power those once-close hold over each other. Edward doesn't have to spell it all out to Susan. She knows she hurt him once and he knows that she knows. He knows that what gives her some peace is the thought that perhaps, with time, he forgave her, or at least understood. He takes that comfort from her.What did Susan do? She left a man she wasn't compatible with. She aborted a baby she didn't want. Whatever your personal opinion of it is doesn't matter; that's not the point. The point is that such things people live with. But Susan now has to live with more than that: the knowledge that she made a person she once loved suffer for the next 20 years. Suffer enough to regret his own softness and humanity (Tony's qualities that made the murder possible). Enough to turn into a man she didn't recognize anymore and to write a book just to make her suffer in turn.3. The ending.I've seen people write THERE IS NO ENDING AT ALL.What happens in the end is this: Edward and Susan arrange for a dinner to discuss the book; she comes and waits; he never appears.It might seem anti-climatic; but if you were in Susan's place, I guarantee you wouldn't say so. She realizes she'll never be absolved; that the worst possible interpretation of Edward's book was the intended one; that this story will soon be published. Maybe become a bestseller. Her past has caught up with her.Thank you for reading and have a great day :)"
" Nocturnal Animals Review.
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,9,"Nocturnal Animals is a stylish thriller written and directed by Tom Ford. In only his second outing as writer/director Ford shows a incredible level of maturity and ease behind the camera. This is exemplified as the film interweaves three stories at once. The film follows Susan Morrow(Amy Adams) as she receives an advanced copy of a revenge thriller novel from her ex-husband Edward Sheffield(Jake Gyllenhaal). Who during the course of film is shown through flashbacks to have been badly hurt by Susan in the films second narrative.As Susan begins to read the novel dedicated to her entitled Nocturnal Animals, the film splits into its third story. It sees Gyllenhaal play the fictional book character called Tony Hastings. As she becomes more and more engrossed in the brutal story, she begins to reflect back on key events that have effected her life and lead to her creative and emotional un-fulfilment.The third storyline, which is the fictional novel unfolding on the screen, is the best part of the film. This story in a story focuses on Tony and his family who are going on a vacation, that is until things turn fatally violent on a lone desert road. They are attacked and ridden off the road at the malice of a crazed lunatic Ray Marcus sadistically played by Aaron-Taylor Johnson, and his two buddies. This part of the story is Immediately the most engaging aspect of the film, and remains so until all three stories converge in the final ten minutes of the film.Nocturnal Animals is beautifully shot by Ford and his cinematographer Seamus McGorvey. It's impeccably crafted using stunning visual imagery. Although it's filled at times with fairly blatant and over the top symbolism and allegories. Whilst it can be distracting in a couple of scenes, the symbolism is well thought out for the most part. Nocturnal Animals is a well written film that pulls no punches, whilst it might not be as brutally visceral as some films in its genre, it's raw Intensity keeps the viewer on edge for the majority of the film. It's a fantastically crafted revenge thriller that works on multiple levels."
" highly overrated and pretentious
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,5,"Boring, waiting for an interesting plot twist which does not come, frustrating how the main character handles the entire situation, again.. boring, and in the end I thought 'was that it?'. Maybe if you have lower expectations you might enjoy it, but since I had high expectations I was quite disappointed. I hoped it would be something like 'Gone Girl', but it does not even come close."
" ""Nocturnal Animals"" could be good
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,6,"Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) is an avant-garde art gallery owner. Her marriage to Hutton Morrow (Armie Hammer) is deteriorating. She receives a manuscript entitled ""Nocturnal Animals"" from her ex-husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) dedicated to her. It's a story of Tony Hastings (Gyllenhaal) driving at night in the middle of nowhere with his wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and their daughter India (Ellie Bamber). They get run off the road by another car. It begins a nightmarish ordeal. Tony escapes without his family. Local police Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon) investigates and zeroes in on Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).The problem with the story within the story is that the intensity is lost. It can't be real in the story telling sense and any tension is limited by that speed restriction. Otherwise, that inner story would make a nice tense neo-western. The outer shell story would benefit by skimming the inner story. It would concentrate the mind and make this a story about a marriage. Tom Ford creates a very beautiful looking movie. The overall structure needs some rethinking. There is a philosophical debate to be had. I also thought Isla Fisher was Amy Adams at first. It would actually be interesting to see Amy play both roles making her see herself in his book. While Ford has a great eye for beauty, there are story telling decisions that are questionable."
" Thrilling Story and Splendid Performances,
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,8,"Nocturnal Animals is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is a very engrossing story that is truly told like no other, it was amazing to see two separate plots in one and how they interconnected with each other. We follow Susan Morrow, as she reads a book her husband dedicated to her, and also get taken in to the book itself. The layers to the plot are incredible, and the cinematography used to convey this strange world is magnificent. I was a little disappointed by the conclusion, not that I would have hoped for a better ending, but I just thought it finished very abruptly. I was surprised when the credits began to roll, I felt like there was still more to be told, a lot of questions left unanswered. I would like to have seen a proper confrontation between Susan and Edward, there is very little scenes with them together, it just left me a little underwhelmed. The cast is all around phenomenal, Amy Adams delivers a rich, somber performance, Michael Shannon is a rough, shady officer who is very intriguing to watch as we never know what he is going to do next, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who steals every scene he is in with his extremely unlikeable character, very surprising work by him. The highlight is without a doubt Jake Gyllenhaal, playing two characters in this, both with a lot of eloquence. While Tony and Edward are not extremely different, he does enough subtle changes with both parts for us to know the difference, he is absolutely spellbinding in this role, every cast member is doing some of their best work here. A slow moving film that provides the best possible thrills. Terrific dialogue, performances and cinematography, we really see Tom Ford's unique vision get brought to life here, and I would recommend Nocturnal Animals to anyone looking for a good thriller. A woman gets sent a book by her ex husband that he wrote in dedication to her, she soon discovers this gesture is not as kind as it may seem. Best Performance: Jake Gyllenhaal"
" An intricate story of revenge
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,8,"Nocturnal animals is a unique story, as it follows two stories, the novel of Edward and Susan reading the book. Nocturnal Animals is a great example of using imagery to convey a message. This film has the underlying theme of revenge, which is truly observed through Susan's life. Jake Gyllenhaal and Aaron Taylor-Johnson stand out in their roles, as they work together brilliant on screen. Amy Adams delivers a mediocre portrayal of Susan, as I believe any actress could act in place of her.Nocturnal Animals is a good story about revenge. 8/10"
" Didn't quite work for me
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,4,"There is no doubt that this is a pretty interesting film and quite sure that many people will enjoy it more than I did.The movie is a story inside a story. Amy Adams plays Susan who is reading a book from her ex husband Edward. Personally I found the book story far more engaging and interesting than the real life storyline. For me the real life story felt very cold and unreal. I have no doubt that many people will find that part of the movie the best, but it just didn't work for me. The plot line of the book worked a lot better and created far more tension.It's undoubtedly a bold movie and should be praised for that. Well worth a watch."
" Not as amazing as I'd expected but pretty good nonetheless
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,8,"Everyone is either hating this movie or loving it. To be honest, I was slightly disappointed because my expectations were very high after watching ""A Single Man."" It wasn't too bad, though. It had the beautiful cinematography and style, and everything was overdramatic, and I loved it. The transition shots were great and the whole thing had that unsettling, sometimes uncomfortable feeling to it. It switched off between the novel scenes, the real life scenes, and the flashbacks so suddenly but it was still clear what was what without clear indicators. Some parts were a little cheese, I'll agree. The soundtrack sounded like a distant ripoff from ""A Single Man."" The biggest complaint from people was that it was boring and there was no pay off. That was actually the thing I liked. The boringness of it, the limbo where nothing really happened. But the way everything was shot was so gorgeous I couldn't look away. At the end, nothing really happened either. He didn't show up while she waited and waited. But it was beautiful. And that kind of ending was great because not everything has a resolution, not everything has to have one. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this. A little disappointed Tom Ford wasn't part of costume design, but he did pretty well with everything else."
" Amazing
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,10,"I never give a movie a ridiculous rating like 10, but I feel compelled to give it to this one. I know this movie is good because of what it did to me emotionally. The film's outrageous. It shows that what is really terrifying is not Satan possessing your child or a murderer killing you in your nightmares--it's the things that can really happen. Like the Stephen King story ""The Ledge"".The casting is perfect. The acting is impeccable. The script is almost beyond improvement. The imagery is especially powerful. The movie even has a subtle absurdist humor that made me think of the futility of human endeavors.You probably see that I cannot gush enough over this movie. You need to see it. Now."
" Horrendous example of arty nonsense.. Avoid!!
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,1,"When a film starts with shockingly unpleasant nudity it doesn't bare well for the rest of the film, realizing I had just paid £4.50 to watch it I decided to grit my teeth and forward the unpleasantness and try and get into the film. The mixed reviews for the film are confusing as some are rating it at 9 and some at 2, unfortunately the 2 gang are correct, the reviewers who described the film as arty don't mean that it has great atmosphere and story line they mean it doesn't make any sense and will baffle you but if your one of those that pretend to think some rubbish art is genius and amazing you will give it a 9 even though you hated it. I had to write this review as I was so disappointed and let down by the whole experience and I don't want anybody else to not only waste an evening but to feel like I did when it had ended.. all this except for Michael Shannon , his acting and presence was excellent, he is an amazing actor and without him in the film I would have given up after 20 minutes. If you like watching good interesting films with great acting and story lines avoid this like the plague, otherwise you will regret it, I really do."
" ""Enjoy the absurdity of our world""
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,8,"I set up my own account especially for this film. I have never even rated or reviewed anything on IMDb before. It is not that this is the best movie there is, it just made me, the viewer, to write what I feel about it. Hardly for me to think that a former fashion designer would be the reason for me to break the silence. Just as Gyllenhaal's character says when asked what had driven him so much to write: ""I guess it is a way of keeping things alive"". Well, I never would have thought that Ford had what the great ones had. You cannot be neglected with this film. It is said that artists tend to represent themselves, or tell stories about themselves in their art, but no big ego emerges from the feeling of the film. I am not talking about the way Ford rejected the possibility for his own clothing line to be used in the movie, but for the way the viewer, or I at least, got the impression that not in the least was I ever put in the second place – in every scene taken care of, being given little gifts, may it be a perfect sky and landscape cinematography, may it be thought provoking conversation of the characters that makes you reflect about yourself. Some movies only take your mind of everything temporarily, or give homework to your thought, but it really does rarely happen to be able to take something great from them. It is truly a great gift to make the perceiver of your art to be willing to change something about themselves. Not just to purely enjoy or be entertained.Since one of the first scenes, where we see Adams' character standing in her home, behind boxes labeled ""Fragile"", I knew that I was in the mercy of a great storyteller. This, and a whole list of other beautiful non-verbal scenes are the strength this film gets its beauty from. Later we see an enormous painting of Re-ven-ge, and as the main heroine, we too become aware of the plot that is about to take place. As an unhappy, high society woman gets out of nowhere, after almost two decades, a violent and depressing book from her former husband, the tone of the movie is definitely set. Even though, she has hurt him immensely in the past, the book is dedicated to her, and its author had the decency before printing to send its work to the same person who didn't think enough of him or believed in his talent to write. What's interesting, is that Adams character is not happy in the present (she's become her greatest fear and worry, a snob, closed, lonely woman, too distracted from the real world, i.e. like her mother), nor she was in the past, when she was enjoying the love of the good and romantic author of the now sad novel in front of her. We don't get to see the former husband in the present. We don't know if he's happy or completely lost in sorrow or pain, we only get to see his work. And his work is amazing. Even the once rigorous critic of his writing, his former wife, now is captivated by his book. The reason may be, that her husband only because of the pain she caused him, was capable through his sorrow to give birth to his well worthy art. Ford says in the movie to take care of the people who love us, to nurture that love, since it is not for granted. The main message of the film is powerful, but for me, those short and beautiful dialogues made the trick. For example, the scenes with Michael Sheen and Andrea Riseborough, are the best part of the film for me. The dilemmas of having a gay loyal husband or a straight unfaithful one, or the guilt that eats up the well-to-do high society members for being too lost of touch with the reality of the world. ""What right do I have to be unhappy? I have everything,"" one of them asks. ""I feel ungrateful for being unhappy."" Far more experienced directors have failed to capture internal turmoils and philosophical journeys as the Ford's second child have. For everyone that desires to be pierced by beauty, I recommend this film."
" Be careful who you wave at when driving!
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,8,"Nocturnal animals, On the way home from the cinema my wife just sat on her hands and kept telling me not to make eye contact with any of the drivers or passengers! For me this film is an easy 8.Beautifully filmed and skipped.It's been a long time since a film has made me feel any tension.The scene on the road, well you will have to see for yourself.AA is really good as are all the other cast members.Mr Hichcock would be proud."
" Lousy Film
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,2,"This film has no coherent story and is a collage-like series of scenes with ultimately no discernible meaning. Meanwhile, there's a lot of preening by cliché characters. The connection between the two stories in the film is flimsy at best. Nocturnal Animals is a total waste of three good actors. It flopped at the box office for a reason. It's awful."
" a story will rise
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,9,"In 2016, Amy Adams starred in what were probably the best movies of her career. There was Denis Villeneuve's ""Arrival"", wherein she plays a linguist who has to determine why extraterrestrial life forms have descended upon Earth. The other was Tom Ford's ""Nocturnal Animals"". Adams plays the ex-wife of a novelist (Jake Gyllenhaal). He has written a novel whose gritty plot reflects his view of their relationship. Reading it forces her to reminisce on her life.Tom Ford first came to my attention when I saw ""A Single Man"", about one day in the life of a closeted gay professor in 1962 Los Angeles. Like that movie, ""Nocturnal Animals"" focuses on memories and regrets. Although the story that Adams's character reads is fictional, the movie makes it look real. And there's some INTENSE stuff here (but none of it gratuitous; it reflects Gyllenhaal's character's interpretation of what happened in their lives).I'd say that Amy Adams got snubbed for an Oscar nod (as did Annette Bening for ""20th Century Women""). This is one movie that everyone should see. Also starring Michael Sheen, Michael Shannon, Armie Hammer and Laura Linney."
" I'm shocked this movie was made in today's feminist, misandrist, leftist environment
",2017-07-07 00:00:00,10,"After being deeply disappointed by ""Demolition"", I decided to give another Gyllenhaal movie a chance--""Nocturnal Animals"". I didn't expect much and knew nothing going in.And all I have to say is wow. I absolutely can't believe such an unapologetically masculine movie was made in 2016 and by a goddamn fashion director to boot.It just doesn't stop throwing real-world truths at you. Let's begin:1. Never try to turn a ho into a housewife. Susan is a slut from the start and even calls herself that. She initiates everything with Edward and invites him over to her place just like that. RED FLAG, men. 2. Hypergamy. Women will always try to ""upgrade"" if the opportunity arises, even if they've already got a good guy. Susan should be thrilled to have a guy like Edward for a husband. She's just a plain jane with regular features, while he's truly handsome. But she can't help but chase an even better looking guy who is successful, even though deep down she knows that such a playboy will never be faithful to her. Female nature exposed.3. Abortion. Susan aborts Edward's child. And she actually says ""HIS CHILD"" in the movie. Unbelievable in this day and age of ""my body my temple my fetus DGAF I do what I want you go grrrl"" feminist BS. 4. The role of a strong husband and father. Tony (the fictional character in the book written by Edward) is a weak coward and is clearly portrayed as such. Tony is unarmed. Tony doesn't fight back, can't fight, doesn't even know how to fight. A man should ALWAYS be prepared for the WORST CASE SCENARIO, ESPECIALLY when with his FAMILY. That means being ARMED and trained in basic fighting skills. The sheriff asks Tony if the men were armed. They weren't. He then asks him why he didn't approach them after they called out to him. Tony's lack of an answer speaks for itself--cowardice. How could a man live with himself after behaving in such a despicable manner? Better to die on your feet than live on your knees--a punk, a coward, a worm. The sheriff communicates as much to Tony by looking at him with pure contempt. And Tony exposes his true feelings towards the end of the film as he breaks down crying and blaming himself for everything. 5. The grotesque naked fat old women at the beginning mock the world of modern art, as they are part of an art exhibition. Modern art is grotesque, pretentious, ridiculous. As grotesque as those naked monstrosities. As pretentious and ridiculous as that art gallery worker and her smartphone. 6. Pro-gun and pro-vigilante justice. The sheriff is a very masculine and very likable character. He just DGAF. Breaks every rule in the book because he's certain about who is guilty. Guns down one piece of sh*t. Shoots him right in the back in cold blood. Then finishes him off. To hell with the liberal fat cats over in Washington. 7. Shockingly enough no characters of colour. No wise and all- knowing Morgan Freeman. No aggressive, racist and obnoxiously loud Sam L Jackson. No sexy Idris Elba second husband. Nothing but a white cast. How the hell did this get green lighted?8. A clear message to women. DO NOT BAT OUT OF OUR LEAGUE, or you will eventually end up being a miserable emotional wreck. Like Susan. 9. A clear message to men. FIGHT TO THE DEATH. Or you will be directly or indirectly responsible for the rape and murder of your women. And end up killing yourself or living the rest of your life psychologically castrated. Messages I disliked but could overlook due to the whole constantly spitting in the face of liberals:1. Short, needless conversation about Susan's gay brother. 2. Comical portrayal of Susan's mother. I don't know who told her to speak like Scarlett O'Hara, but the result was atrocious and affected. 3. The ""Republican"" reference for the plebs. Anyone who knows anything is fully aware that bankers are pulling the strings and parties and politicians mean nothing. Cinematography, lighting, music, acting (aside from Amy Adams, who just stares blankly) all on point.A true feast for the eyes, ears, mind and spirit."
" Overrated
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,6,"Nothing special or extraordinary about the story, the acting, the cinematography... Just a very ordinary Hollywood movie. It's not a bad movie, but at the same rate it's certainly not ""Oscars"" worthy like some critics and fans are crying for... Such pretentious and herd mentality people! The ending is very anticlimactic and blunt. Nothing worth seeing again."
" Just dull.
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,7,"Well acted, and it was great seeing Jake and his co-star from that cult classic again in the same film but for those who read novels, which for those that saw this movie which are few, to really understand it I think you need to read the novel.Since the boards are gone, here it goes. Well acted and Shannon is especially good as ever. One of the few actors without a massive ego. This movie just is so downbeat and it for me was like reading a novel but in the movie not really getting it because you don't get the depth of it.I just watched it and it is just boring. A Hollywood movie for the Hollywood crowd that does not connect with people. The rich folk.So basically she breaks up with him early in life, she marries an asshole, he sends her a manuscript to show that he does have talent and she she reads it and is taken in by his talent. Then he shows her up when she realizes she made a mistake and didn't want to be with a writer in college days and married and married a cheating husband instead she met in college and is miserable.A waste of time unless you loved the book but some books can't be played out that shortly. Well done production and acting wise, but their is an empty and shallow feeling I felt at the end that is meaningless to the average person. I get the stars in this industry have their problems, we all do, but I don't relate to this movie one bit. Thank God I only spent 50 cents extra on it for an add on at the Redbox. I will pay 15 dollars to see a movie if it is worth it on it's release or near it in a movie theater. This, I am glad I did not."
" An intriguing movie, suspense, and well told
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,9,"I don't like drama or romance movie. This movie is not about them anyway. I like movie that challenge me intellectually or disturb me emotionally. This movie does those two things, heavily in second thing.The plot is the seduction, flashbacks between the content of the book, the reality now, and the past is structured in such a way to engage the viewers deeply in Susan's world without the need to explain anything. All of the stories are out there, you just need t construct them in your mind. The acting is good and enjoyable. Superb even. The background, decoration, settings and music are well integrated one another. Many symbols. I like it. At the end of this movie I felt something. I felt my emotions and hearts were upside down. If you need something that can make your heart and mind engaged in an intrigue way, I concur you want to watch this movie"
" A simple story in an unusual plot
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,8,The film tells a simple story in an unusual plot. 2 parallel stories mirror each other and the strong connections depict the whole idea behind the plot in a metaphorical way. The performances by actors are terrific. Every emotion and every little subtle detail are captured in the film. A delicate film worth a second watch.
" Sum of the whole lesser than the parts
",2017-06-30 00:00:00,5,"My advice - if you want to watch this, skip the first chapter. You won't miss anything, and might still be able to eat popcorn for the rest of the movie. The ""story within a story"" was good, a harsh look at human behavior (moreso for the antagonist than for Gyllenhall's ""weak"" character, hard to imagine anyone so complacent). Distracting bits include Adams' awful makeup, the random horror sequences, and out of place soundtrack. The movie ended with a whimper... I literally said ""That's it?"" and looked for a post-credit scene. Another case of the trailer completely misleading the viewer about the content and tone of the film. Some stunning visuals in the desert, but overall left me thinking ""meh""."
" One of the top 10 movies that suck.
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,2,"This is right up there in the top 10 movies of all time that SUCK! If you want to watch 2 hrs of ""I wonder who is actually doing what"" and then find out you are never going to know, then watch this movie. There have been worse movies I have almost sat through, but not many. If they had just gone ahead and made the movie about the guy having his wife and daughter raped and killed and left the Amy Adams parts out it would have been a better movie. But the director decided he was going to get ""artsy"" and ""deep"" and ruined it by not having the ability. I love Amy Adams and I like Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon but they wasted their time on this movie, I only hope they got paid well. If I had been them I would have been bissed to be associated with something like this. The first 5 minutes of the movie sets the quality of this flick. If you haven't watched it yet Don't! You will be happy you didn't. If you have watched it already and thought it was great, then you need therapy. If you have watched it and thought it sucked, then congratulations you are normal.P.O.S. describes this movie very well."
" Something you never intended
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,9,"An unhappy wife reads a story sent by her long estranged ex-husband, and their past comes back to haunt her.A deep and troubling story. A bizarre opening sequence introduces us to the carnival world of the heroine's successful yet vapid career, then we're plunged into the casual depression of her personal life, and then we enter the violence of the story within the story. That violence is not overly harsh, but the tension it creates is harrowing and seeps out into the main story as the past is gradually revealed.This is beautifully shot and performed, with profound themes tying together in a dark view of life. On first viewing I was really engaged in the story and ended up with the sense of something vitally true yet horribly sad - and still feeling there was more to understand and appreciate, that surely there must be some redemption.The time-lines switch between present, fantasy, and flash-back past, and the mood and pace vary as we pass in and out. Although the story in the present is subtle, there is one touch of horror with a dropped phone that nails an intense pessimism, but then the final scene was just vague enough to leave me turning things over in my mind. This has to be re-watched to pick up the full significance.The performances are excellent, especially those of the heroine and the law man. The music is mostly strings, not overdone, and the sound of the heartbeat reminded me of Looking For Mr Goodbar.Overall: Immaculate production that may be the most stylish horror movie."
" A short review based upon 30 minutes of stress
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,1,"All the actors are good. That is part of the reason it decided to watch this. Unfortunately, the story line is predictable, so violent and so disturbing that after 30 minutes I had to turn it off. This begs the question - why can't a writer / director make a movie that involves a horrific situation without having to explicitly show what goes on? This was disgusting. And there was no need for it . If you're pandering to the exploitation crowd, then when bother pretending that your product is anything other than what it is?A real disappointment. Crude, depressing and disturbing. And that's just the first thirty minutes. Strive for something better. I got this from the library. Had I paid to see it I would have been really angry. ."
" Sleepless/Restless
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,10,"While that would apply to my current state too (it's almost 4 am at the time of writing this), I am obviously talking about the movie. It's really a wicked one. It's so entangled and webbed in together, that it does warrant repeated viewings. If you are into that sort of mind twisting story telling that is of course.I'm not even giving anything away, because you can tell by the beginning act or by the trailer if you watched that. It's not a movie that you can just watch lightly. It does need your full attention. Again, that does not mean it is a movie that you'll like. That is a matter of taste. But technically speaking and acting wise, this is superb. The suspension is killing the viewer ... no pun intended. So ... What? Exactly, this may be your reaction at the end of it (or even during the movie) ... I'd argue that is a good thing, in this case"
" From Suits to Cinema
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,8,"Nocturnal Animals is a film by Ford, Tom Ford. The fashion designer turned writer/director brings us, in his second feature film, the story of Susan, an art gallery owner who receives a draft of her ex husband, Edward's, new novel. As she reads, she becomes more and more absorbed in protagonist, Tony's, ordeal, relating and feeling for him as well as, reflecting upon her own life. Tom Ford proves himself to be a man of many talents, crafting a story that is seamlessly interwoven and complex, and is also guaranteed to generate discussion. This was a major Oscar snub at the 2017 academy awards.Ford's efforts are not only good in their own right, but in the fact that they marry so well into each other. Ford is able to write a fantastic script and then elevate that with his stunning direction. The two work seamlessly together. Just one way in which Ford displays a sophisticated interworking of script and direction, comes in the presentation of the three different time lines. Ford's script is multi layered and features three different time lines; Susan's past, Susan's present and the fictional world of the Nocturnal Animal's book. The script jumps from each timeline with purpose and Ford's visual presence defines each timeline; Susan's present being very desaturated and dull looking, Susan's past being soft lit and somewhat warmer and nicer, and the book being very saturated with the beige and orange a Texan desert would entail. The audience is always aware of what timeline they are in with Ford's highly sophisticated narrative structure as well as the visual distinction he makes between each timeline.Personally the greatest aspect of Ford's masterpiece is his use of symbolism. Whether it is the red couch or literally every character in the book, Ford embeds meaning that film critics and scholars could write papers on and endlessly discuss. It is obvious that Tony Hastings is a reflection of Edward Sheffield, but to what extent is Tony a reflection of Susan? And although Ford has stated what Ray and Bobby represent, could we go deeper, exploring what they represent to Edward and Susan as well? Could we narrow down their purpose in the story or are they simply personifications of the good and the bad? The film is open to discussion and thus I believe this gives it a long shelf life.Ford is also very good when handling his themes. Nocturnal Animals is a revenge story, hell it literally spells out the word 'Revenge' in an art piece mid film, but the film is also a cautionary tale to successful people, and frankly anyone, about how they shouldn't throw people away for money, or fame, or any other kind of acclaim or success. Considering Ford being a part of both the fashion and film industry, to very brutal industries, you can tell that he has struggled with this. This message thus feel like a personal belief of Ford's and this is felt in his film, thus adding an auteur touch to his work. Going back to the theme of revenge again, the ending is the crescendo to what is Ford's symphony. The entire film has built to this moment and the ultimate revenge is claimed by Edward and it is simply magnificent, the bitter sweet cherry on top if you will.As well as Ford, the film boasts an extremely talented cast; Jake Gyllenhaal, Amy Adams, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Michael Shannon, Michael Sheen, Isla Fisher etc. The ensemble cast pretty much guarantees good acting and they do not disappoint, in fact it even surprised me in a good way. The stand out performance is what surprised me, and that came from none other than Aaron Taylor-Johnson. The actor completely subverts any expectations of him in a truly gritty and evil performance as the films antagonist, Ray Marcus. Far removed from Kick Ass and the dull protagonist he played in Godzilla, Taylor-Johnson earned his Golden Globe for this film and definitely deserved an Oscar nomination. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon also shine in this film, especially when they share scenes together. Shannon's American hero sheriff character, Bobby Andes, is extremely likable and the chemistry he has with Jake Gyllenhaal's extremely emotional, Tony Hastings, is subtly displayed yet in a rather engrossing way. The diner scene is one of the best in the film and presents their mutual respect and care for one another perfectly.Nocturnal Animal's is a triumph. Ford successfully both writes and directs a multi layered story with exquisite symbolism and powerful messages and themes. An all round outstanding production that has been majorly overlooked at the Oscars.... The film stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams, that in itself is a formula for a great movie that will be overlooked at the Oscars, but hopefully one day they will all get their day in the sun."
" Poignant Thriller , Rich Symbolism and Great Acting makes up this very good film indeed
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,9,"Most people here confused this movie saying it's more style and less substance but it's terrific. It's very good. First of all , yes it is very artful but that doesn't bother much when you have got rich symbolism and clear cut beautiful cinematography coupled with haunting score. The characters are great and even great is the work done by the actors. There are two narratives. One is of real time and another is of a novel. And both are great. While the first one teases a sense of realism and promises and delivers little character development, it's the second narrative that's thrilling , sad and gripping. It's about failed relationship , regrets and the novel inside the film which is read by Susan , Amy Adams character boasts a terrific story which will hook you up right from the start and will end with a devastating finish. Moreover , the film is watchable and I can a great work. As a normal film-goer I do not understand art or very high standard of film making , I just enjoy movies and look where I can understand something. And yes I do find rich symbolism in this movie , particularly how wrong decisions and a different or perhaps repentful path of life is symbolized by the story of the novel. As it goes for the title , I can't think of anythink else. Amy Adams as always is great although for awards Arrival has a bit more edgy performance by her. Jake Gyllenhal and Michael Shannon are terrific. Perhaps Aaron Taylor Johnson is the ultimate surprise with a negative role of a disgusting person. I believe this is his career's best performance so far. At last , as a thriller movie it stand out with some different style but it's good to be different sometimes. This is no cliché or deja vu , just brand new film that needs to be watched. One of the best movie of 2016 hands down."
" very teasing movie...worst in the sense that he the Edward seemed as coward as a human can get...totally handicap person
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,1,movies like this encourage the wrong perception about the people that they are so much coward to do secure their family..this misconception leads to a weak society...u cant play with peoples emotion like this..when it comes to family its always been a do or die scenario..but this different thing is full of disgrace to the bond of family the movie was lacking revenge which makes a person feel sated
" Ugly Art Is Still in Vogue
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,5,"The twentieth century is when art became ugly. Oh, I'm not talking about the kind of art that philistines like me enjoy. I'm talking about that highbrow, elitist art consisting of ridiculous paintings, nonsense novels, discordant music, and weird foreign films. By the twenty-first century, the novelty of ugliness had begun to wear off a bit, but it can still be counted on to appeal to those who believe that an appreciation of ugliness is the mark of refinement.Nocturnal Animals is not a weird foreign film, of course, but it could pass for one. Right off the bat, the movie presents its highbrow bona fides by displaying disgustingly obese, naked women, dancing in place, in what turns out to be an art exhibit. The woman who has arranged all this is Susan (Amy Adams). Her life is as ugly as her art show, notwithstanding all the opulence in which she dwells. Her husband cheats on her. She can't sleep.She receives in the mail an unpublished novel from her ex-husband, Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal). I don't suppose I have to tell you that it is an ugly novel. It is about a man named Tony, also played by Jake Gyllenhaal in Susan's mind as she reads the novel. Just in case we might wonder if she is projecting by making this identification between the author and the protagonist, there is an earlier discussion between Susan and Edward when they were married, presented in a flashback. She criticized something he wrote, telling him he needs to write about someone other than himself. He says all authors do that. They don't, of course. As Nietzsche once said, ""Homer would never have created an Achilles or Goethe a Faust, had Homer been an Achilles or Goethe a Faust."" But in this case, Edward has created a Tony because he is a Tony.Anyway, in this novel, Tony, his wife, and his daughter are traveling across west Texas when they are waylaid by a bunch of psychopathic punks. The movie wallows in the misery of a family being brutalized, resulting in the rape and murder of the two females. With the aid of a lawman named Andes, who is dying of lung cancer, Tony is able to track down the killers. Andes kills one of them, and Tony kills the other. However, the one Tony kills lives just long enough to hit Tony in the head with a poker, blinding him. Tony staggers outside, falls, and accidentally shoots himself, resulting in his death.In reading the novel, Susan is deeply moved, even more than she was moved by watching a bunch of naked, four-hundred-pound women jiggle their decaying flesh. Why is she moved? Well, it probably has to do with the abortion she had after Edward got her pregnant. She never meant for Edward to find out, but for some reason he just happens to show up at the abortion clinic just as she finished having it done. So, you see, the death of Tony's daughter corresponds to the death of Edward's aborted child. And the rape and murder of Tony's wife corresponds to Susan's infidelity, because turning Susan's voluntary lust and betrayal into a gangbang rape is Edward's imaginary revenge against her. And just as Edward knows that he is weak, Tony is too weak to save his wife and child.The death of Tony in the novel corresponds to Edward's suicide, the novel being one long suicide note, which basically says, ""You ruined my life by rejecting my love."" This is not made explicit, but it is obvious. When Susan emails Edward, saying she wants to see him, he emails her back, agreeing to meet. She goes to a restaurant, but Edward never shows up. Of course not. He's dead.For people like me, this is an ugly novel within an ugly movie. No wonder it got rave reviews."
" Exhausting
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,1,"This movie was exhausting to watch...the pain, the despair and sadness all rolled up in a nice present for you to watch. If that's what you want for two hours out of your life, then I suggest watch this movie without a proper ending. Being stood up at the end? That's the best this movie could offer? Really? That in and of itself is sad, but believe me...this movie makes you feel all things negative while watching. Thanks...thanks a lot!"
" Metafiction and Flamboyance in Nocturnal Animals (2016)
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,8,"Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals (2016) opens with a sequence that has been attacked for being disgusting, demeaning, misogynist and irrelevant. The sequence features a number of obese women provocatively dancing nude, which turns out to be part of an exhibition put on in an art gallery owned by Susan Morrow (Amy Adams). I just can't help but wonder whether viewers would have had the same reaction if the dancing models were slim SuperBarbies or six-packed young men. Just wondering.The sequence is shocking, and it sets the entire tone of the film because it unveils the stark discrepancy between reality and our individual perception of what reality is – a kernel component of the story.We then follow the extremely classy Susan to the coldness of her prodigal house and get to know her dashingly handsome, and equally distant, husband Hutton (conveniently played by Armie Hammer). Susan receives the manuscript of a new novel written by her ex-husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) whom she hasn't seen in years. She decides to occupy her sleepless nights reading the book which, according to Edward's note, is inspired by and dedicated to her. Here, the diegetic narrative unfolds into other two story lines treading two different paths: fictional and chronological. As Susan reads the emotionally devastating story about Tony Hastings (also played by Gyllenhaal) who takes his family on a trip that ends tragically with the rape and murder of his wife and daughter, she helplessly reminisces about her self-sabotaged relationship with Edward.It's a no-brainer figuring out that Edward's novel is an allegory of the emotional turmoil caused by Susan who had aborted his child and run off with a wealthier and worldlier man. In the end, Tony takes revenge on the men who killed his family, and Edward well, he doesn't exactly kill Susan, but he does something similar: He stands her up at a restaurant. Yes. That's it. I know how absurd the comparison may sound but please bear with me.Edward is a writer. He is wired to creatively put himself and his emotions on the line and transform his reality into art. Susan, on the other hand, who married Edward solely to rebel against her parents' selective lifestyle, willingly traps herself and limits her emotions to the reality of a rigid, materialistic world. It is hard to miss how the blue and white colors dominate the scenes in which Susan is on screen, whereas red and green are the main colors in Edward's story. They both stand in contrast to each other, yet visually negotiate the relation between reality and fiction.. what it is and what it feels like.Edward's payback is epic by all means; just as Susan had pumped reality into his art by providing him with the painful experience and memories, he has contaminated her fragile, dry reality with his emotionally powerful art. By making Susan read his novel, allowing her the pleasure to suffer and catharize her sense of guilt, offering her a glimpse of sentimental freedom, and getting her hopes up about loving and being loved only to crush them down is just as harsh as a bullet to the brain.Tony had a gun. Edward had a story.Tony, Edward's metafictional persona, is blinded after shooting the deranged murderer Ray (a wickedly excellent performance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and accidentally – or not! – kills himself. The scene is ostentatiously grotesque if we think about it in realistic/Susan's terms. However, it perfectly resonates with Edward's pain and his creative attempts to emotionally strip in front of everyone – an act virtually similar to suicide.And if you think that the novel is an exaggerated expression of a relatively less painful hardship, add the film itself as another non-diegetic layer of artistic exaggeration of a seemingly humdrum experience. Ford brilliantly embraces and manifests art as a lavish exaggeration of the mundane; this is not only evident in the story but in his picturesque style and rakish colors and frames as well. Nocturnal Animals is a Charlie Kaufman-esque film with the flamboyant sensitivity of Tom Ford.The film features an outstanding cast who don't shy away from flaunting their admirable talents around. And still, the effortless greatness of Michael Shannon who plays Bobby Andes, the hard-boiled detective who helps Tony find the murderers, has left me in awe.Here comes another film from screenwriter and director Tom Ford, and along comes another sea-parting controversy over his competence as a filmmaker. À la the hassle that followed A Single Man (2009), critics and viewers alike are quite unsure what to make of Mr. Ford's work: Should he be banished back to the flamboyant world of fashion design? Should he be hailed as a stylishly exuberant auteur? Whichever stance people take, the only thing that annoys me is the insistence on using Ford's renowned career in fashion against him. The sensibilities employed to create fashion and visual art in general are extravagant, but isn't cinema all about the extravagant symbolism of the image?"
" A Wonderful Experience
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,9,"I watched this movie without any expectations and I have to say I was extremely impressed with just how well Tom Ford has executed his first film.First off, the casting is brilliant and the filming is mesmerizing and phenomenal. This film is an absolute eye candy to watch, furthermore, the plot is complex, intriguing and keeps you guessing throughout most of the film.I particularly admired just how well the film blends the real world, a sleek, modern and upscale reality which Susan lives in, compared to the die hard southern American environment and characters which are portrayed in the novel. It's a combination of complete Black vs White, but it fits in perfectly. The film is packed with symbolism and visual aids which help you connect the dots in order to interpret the plot and the ending to me was exactly what I expected.As a fashionable person it was also very nice to see how aesthetically pleasing this film is, as it's directed by such a great designer, it just goes to show that creativity can span farther and greater than one's main occupation in life and I think Tom Ford has done an excellent job on this film. Looking forward to seeing his next works.I also think that this film should really be ranked higher than a 7.5, for me it's a 9."
" A strikingly beautiful movie full of emptiness
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,5,"Hyper privileged 40-something Susan has an enviable job, a huge villa on the hills, an unfaithful - albeit polite and charming - husband and and ex-husband, who out of the blue sends her the manuscript of his book.Ex-hubby Edward resentfully avoided contact with Susan for 19 years but suddenly he decides he wants her opinion about his book. This seems fishy, but Susan is delighted - maybe because her marriage is on the rocks and she feels nostalgic about Edward...Major problem here: how did Edward know about Susan's situation? They were not in contact for 19 years after a brutal break-up but somehow he guessed that Susan's life has reached luxurious rock-bottom: failed marriage, dissatisfaction with the job, boredom all round, despite the lavish lifestyle.Anyway, the ""movie within the movie"" starts with Susan reading the novel, a violent story more interesting than the ""real"" one.The novel should be interpreted as Edward's revenge. He wants to upset Susan by metaphorically eliminating her in a brutal way. However, Edward comes out as mean and weak for carrying a grudge for all those years. Susan gets plenty of time to regret her decisions, but she cannot change the past.As to be expected the photography, costumes and sets are chilling beautiful - ""chilling""being the key word. The brutal ""fictional"" story is gripping, although silly in parts, the ""conversation before killing someone"" cliché being the silliest, but the point of the whole movie seems to be that rich people can also be unhappy.That may be so, but as it was stated many times, it is better to cry in a Roll Royce coming back from the most expensive restaurant in town, rather than in a cardboard box under a bridge."
" ..sleek.. immaculate.. yet impassionate..
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,6,"At the end of the film she obviously sits and waits for him for a very long time.. in an outfit that was selected by her to be most alluring. Yea, for him had to be more revenge payback.. you kill my kid and abandon me because you're weak and under mommy's full control, you have to pay the price. Only real fly in the ointment, (did I miss something).. why did it take all those nineteen years for him to seek his revenge.. (simply to have the two reclining nudes looking similar?).It's thought provoking, and looks very pretty.. but it is overall a cold film, and it keeps the viewer at a distance. A good portion of the screen time deals with the re-enactment of his novel.. and although that portion is very well done, had they spent more time on the other half of the story, it might have overall been more viewer friendly. It's a well acted and produced film, but something essential feels missing."
" Slow, Boring and Not Interesting. I stopped watching because I was falling asleep.
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,1,"As a Guiding Principle, I will watch any movie with Amy Adams or Isla Fisher. They were both in this movie.Having said that, I did not appreciate being bamboozled by a series of extremely obese dancing naked chicks at the beginning of the movie. There should have been a warning about that. It was all in slow motion and their fat rolls were flabbing up and down so much that I almost barfed. The actual movie was boring and I stopped it about one hour in because I couldn't stay awake."
" Jake Gyllenhaal does it again.
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,9,"Gyllenhaal has become one of the most versatile actors today, taking on projects of diverse magnitudes and genres. Nocturbal Animals has slid from the major attention and was not marketed as widely, and for a good reason. Ford has brought to life a story within a story, borderline Inception style, with no clear ending, and complete freedom to interpretation, borderline Inception style. Of course, comparing these two pictures cannot be rationally justified, as NA focuses on a story of love and loss. Oh wait. It is, however very pleasant to see the filming industry proving the audience with opportunity to reach their own interpretations and conclusions, compelling the audience to invest themselves in the story.Although, as expected, the movie portrays events from a usual heavily dramatized Hollywood light, it remains to be a gripping piece of art, which potentially will open doors and inspire further diversity within the genre."
" A beautiful and thrilling film, with a few shortfalls
",2017-05-26 00:00:00,8,"After watching the movie, I was a little unsure of how I interpreted the movie and how I felt about it. However, after mulling the film over for a few hours, I can conclude that it was a good movie.Director Tom Ford attempts to show a man's (Edward's) transformation and emotions after a heartbreaking experience in his life, specifically through the perspective of his ex-wife, Susan. Ford beautifully intertwines three sections: the past, the present, and a novel story line written by Edward, into a two hour film. The phenomenal editing of the movie and the thrilling parallels between the reality and the novel definitely helped Ford achieve what he intended to show the audience: a beautiful chaos of a man's life being turned upside down and the transformation that results from it.The three sections are depicted beautifully through the photography, each with their own distinct style. The acting was good, as can be expected from Jake Gyllenhaal, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Gyllenhaal impressively depicts the emotions of a man who undergoes the worst nightmare a husband/father can experience. Adams does a good job of portraying the frustration, confusion, and desperation of a woman unhappy with her life. Shannon and Taylor-Johnson are phenomenal in their character portrayals in Edward's story, despite the novel story line being disturbingly dark overall.The costume design was also pleasing to the eye, as can be expected from a famous fashion designer turned film director.To share a few dislikes: The film seems to want to show a lot of emotions, thoughts, and symbolism, but ends up not completing most of the attempts. Not saying that the movie is missing any components nor is it a cliff hanger, but the concepts or messages that Tom Ford tries to give to the viewer seem incomplete. He himself says that he tries to ""put a lot of things in the film that maybe you wouldn't see the first time,"" but his use of the symbols (like the red sofa, the cross necklace, the green Pontiac, Ray's ring, and Susan's wedding ring) don't really come full circle to wrap up the concepts they introduce.Altogether though, Ford delivers a thrilling motion picture that stays in the viewers' mind as they attempt to mull it over and understand the director's intentions."
" Can We Stand the Characters--That's the Key
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,8,"I'm giving this rating because it is more important to me that a director try something new than fall back on clichés. As is usually the case with ""something new"" there are going to be fits and starts and not everything works. The attempt was to show us the nocturnal animals. In the case of the novel, they are predatory, redneck men who single out a family in a car, heading for a vacation house. The threat is heavy and palpable, and we know that when they try to ""help,"" they are doing so to get what they want. Jake Gyllenhaal's character would like to believe that they will have their fun and then back off. We know that's not going to happen. The desolation of the desert and the fabric of the Western setting also tell us that lawlessness can pretty much call the shots. The sheriff, dying of lung cancer, becomes pivotal. He is desperate and has been mistreated during his time as a lawman. He's willing to go all out, but Gyllenhaal has no plan of his own. Meanwhile, we are focused on artist, Amy Adams, who is living the angst of one who never seems to quite make it and who is in a loveless marriage. Her handsome guy is always away on business and sleeps around with little effort to hide things. She is a nocturnal animal, in that nighttime is endless. When her ex-husband (Gyllenhaal--in the flesh--not the victimized father) emerges after nineteen years, they hook up. But his hesitation and vacillating are still things that turn her off. But the book--the book--is captivating to her. She starts to see him as more than he is. He also needs her love and approval. She has hoped not to be seen as a dilettante her whole career, but may be headed down the road to emptiness. This is a really interesting film, even if at times it slips."
" Whaaaaaaat????
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,5,"I would like to see this as two separate movies. 1. The novel portion 2. The portion with Susan and EdwardThe novel portion - decentThe portion with Susan and Edward - I would appreciate if the writer didn't put so much ""artistic creativity"" in my hands and instead of leaving it up to me decide why - just make a decision and make the story....."
" An engaging story about the aftermath of a failed marriage
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,8,"Nocturnal Animals is a psychological thriller starring Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Based on the novel ""Tony and Susan"" by Austin Wright, the film is a beautiful looking neo-noir tale of revenge and features yet another great acting performance from Amy Adams.Susan Morrow (Amy Adams), the affluent owner of an art gallery in Los Angeles, receives an advance copy of a novel written by her ex-husband Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal). Upon reading the novel, titled ""Nocturnal Animals"" after a nickname Edward once gave her, Susan becomes obsessively engrossed in the story and situations pertaining to its characters, which she begins to interpret as a metaphor for her failed marriage.Haunting, suspenseful, and well-acted, Nocturnal Animals is an engaging story about the aftermath of an unsuccessful relationship. Director Tom Ford makes great use of colour and lighting to enhance the mood and immerse the audience in the plot. Amy Adams' performance in the film is terrific, as to be expected and along with Arrival, this is easily one of her best most recent roles. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon shine as well, but Aaron Taylor-Johnson gives a surprisingly chilling portrayal as the villain of the film.I rate it 8/10"
" My 2 cent on the 2 cent movie script
",2017-05-22 00:00:00,2,"The movie is like an angry YouTube video, its sole purpose is to play on the lowest and most primal of human feelings such as injustice and cheap over-convolution. To explain further, with spoilers ofc, since there is nothing to spoil, the entire movie is a cheap trick from Tom Ford. it combines all the ""activators"" and convoluted storytelling found in cheap tabloid news and YouTube videos. What this movie needs and misses more than a real story and a director is some illegal dog fighting, anti- semitism, chauvinism's and of course some homophobia so it can activate every type of person. WHY? Because you will get no other emotional response from this set of moving pictures!"
" An excellent film about human nature and relationship
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,10,"Spoiler alert....Please don't read if u haven't seen the movie....So...here is what i think of the plot.Susan left Edward chasing something bigger.Edward used to call her Nocturnal Animal while they were together.She left him and she also had an abortion on his babe.Edward could do nothing but watching her leaving and killing the family they could have.So the novel he sent to her is really about them.About her.And this explains the title of the novel.Tony,the main character of the novel is really Edward who watches his family taken away by 3 Nocturnal Animals(Suzan) and get killed while he can do nothing.At the end he finds the strength to kill those animals but he kills himself too.But the some seems to have happened to Edward...in his real life....He can't forgive Susan ...his own Nocturnal Animal.He seeks for revenge ...revenge Suzan who left him and revenge himself who did nothing...That's why he never shows up at the end of the movie at the restaurant.He has killed Susan inside him but since she was his only and true love of his life .living her alone in the restaurant even though she wanted a second chance with him ,this really kills him too.Concerning Susan...she realizes that the real revenge is not only from Edward but by herself too.When she watches the phone video of her colleague's baby she drops the phone because she saw one of the 3 nocturnal animals there.Of course the murderer was never there but that was symbolic about how she murdered her own baby when she had that abortion.Because she was the Nocturnal Animal of her own life...So the real revenge and the worse is realizing at some point of your life that u lost real happiness chasing something bigger but Utopia.Chasing happiness sometimes is like salt water...the more u drink the more u get thirsty"

" A Depiction of Pain Through the Eyes of the One Unwillingly Causing It
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,8,"A terrifying and beautiful film about a creative person sublimating pain the only way they know how. They channel the overwhelming sadness of loss into their creative work seeking some kind of closure, one that may remain elusive nevertheless. At times such a creation never reaches its intended audience. The feeling of guilt can force the one causing pain to run and even suppress any memory of the past into nonexistence. Fortunately, it is not the case with Nocturnal Animals, otherwise we'd never see her read his story. That would be a sad loss in itself."
" Revenge Revenge
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,6,"The opening credits. Sweet Lord. I promise I will never objectify women again if only I get the images of the dancing grotesques out of my memory. I fought the temptation to pluck out my eyes and persevered with this tale of revenge. We know it is about revenge because a) it is obvious and b) A 10' art installation called REVENGE is shoe-horned into a scene (incidentally featuring a character who must have been inspired by Bubble from Ab-Fab). The plot: Adams receives a manuscript from her ex (Gyllenhaal) that features a man (Gyllenhaal) who has his family ripped from him (why this strikes a chord with Amy becomes apparent later) and how he subsequently tracks down the perpetrators with the aid of a coughing lawman. This story within the story is far better scripted and acted than the parent story but Gyllenhaal excels as a weak man tormented by the past in both. The supporting cast in the sub-plot are also far superior, Fisher, Shannon and Taylor-Johnson in particular out act the plank-like Hammer and decidedly sub par Sheen in the parent story. And then there's Amy... It's about time the Academy introduced a new award for best tear ducts. Unfortunately our Amy has opted for the full paralysis Botox which makes it impossible for the viewer to determine what emotion she is exhibiting if it weren't for her tear ducts. In this movie tears means upset, no tears means not upset - yes the full gamut. Seriously it is a proved fact that those who cannot physically display emotion have less empathy than those that do. Compare the static, icy Adams portrayal of a woman in a disintegrating marriage who is supposedly seriously disturbed by the revenge motif-ed manuscript to that of Gyllenhaal's puny husband in full gargoyle- gurn mode. Finally we get to the final scene where the best the viewer can manage is an 'oh, is that it?'. Despite its flaws this is worth a watch, if only for the West Texan scenery."
" 8/10, if we ignore the first scene!
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,8,"I just hate that a movie so good would start with the cheap display of bare breasts. The movie is so grasping that one cant keep one's laptop down even for a second, just like we can't keep a good book down. The plot was so well thought-out and was almost flawless. Furthermore, the revenge of the ex-husband was so subtle and so.. elaborately vengeful that I just am truly amused by the thinking and creativity of the writer. Lastly, I love that the story-line was so different than all the other movies I have seen."
" No matter how much you dress it, s*** is still s***
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,1,"First of all, I am really curious about how they got a 15 age restriction in the USA, I wonder if these guys have actually watched the film to rate it so. Second of all, I do not say this lightly and I have watched many historical dramas or documentaries that did not interest me but I have never watched a film as boring as this one. The film simply does not have a strong story. It targets rich people at their 30s, I believe, and I am sure that's where it gets its rating boosted.What is good about this film? Well the music, the colours, visuals... They reflect the feelings really good. I give them that. However, I believe everyone was aware how light and useless the story was that they just tried to hide it all behind the visually 'arty' scenes and musics. Yet, they have tried it so hard that after a moment it felt really exaggerated.What is really bad about this film? Story. Superficial and pumped with the boring Hollywood thriller clichés. It lacks any kind of logic or a foundation under it. It gives no explanations but this does not make it a deeper story as this is not a mystery film. On the contrary, it gives no explanations because it fails to develop the characters and remain quite superficial. I hoped to watch a suspenseful thriller with a complicated story. I got a disgusting, sexually over empathised film, that does not tell you a story but just tries to make you feel some feelings, especially if you can associate with the characters yourself as I am sure a few do. It tries to ask and question life but does it very superficially. Yet in the end it tries too hard to give the feelings that you just respond with a yawn, mumble 'seriously' and check the time to see how long this torture of boredom is gonna last for. It could have been an amazing film but for that the story should have been developed, expanded, rewritten. My verdict: It has too many clichés for an 'art' film. It has too superficial story for a thriller. And it conveys all the drama through visual art to cover the 'weak' story."
" Okay but also quite dull
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,3,"It's got Vod from Fresh Meat in it. That was the highlight for me. Would be a better film if the whole art lady wasn't in it. Just following a bloke who let his family be kidnapped and killed hunt the murders down with a odd cop. I also kept thinking his parents had been murdered too. ""Your folks"" in the UK is mum and dad not wife a daughter. So that was a bit misleading."
" Well worth watching....if properly prepared!
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,8,"I have never written a movie review before. I also had never heard of Tom Ford or Austin Wright. With that said I went into this movie totally unbiased and based on recommendation by co workers.After seeing the movie I decided to check out IMDb and see the quotes, goofs, trivia and whether it was a screen play or based on a book. From what I have found out about the book, the movie works closely with the overall theme of it.This time I also chose to read reviews about the movie. And there is such a wide range of opinion from no stars to ten stars with lots of both positive and negative reviews. For those who rated it negatively, based on their comments, I would think that they might not have understood the plot nor the subplot of the movie. You have to look deep within the movie and understand the plot and purpose of the film. No, it's not the best movie I have ever seen but based on Hollywood's overexposure of super heroes, science fiction and unrealistic fantasy plots they produce, this was a good, solid thriller that although might not have left me sitting on the edge of my seat, it did open my mind to see the subplots intended. I won't say much else because I could spoil it, but think closely about the characters and what they represented and think closely about the underlying messages within the story and enjoy the movie.This movie is an intellectual thriller and you must have a little higher intellect to really understand it."
" reaction

It has an artistic aspect to it that is rarely seen in Hollywood--namely creativity without regard to political correctness. It is rich with the realities of life and full of passion, power, betrayal and love. It is a stark reminder of holding the most important things in life close."

" ""Nocturnal Animals"": Not as Wild about this Crew of Critters as Originally Reckoned
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,6,"I finally watched a couple of the more notable films of last year over this past week, ""Manchester by the Sea"" and ""Nocturnal Animals"". I wasn't sure I even wanted to see the former. Now it is one of my all-time favorite movies. I did, however, believe that I would really enjoy the latter title. And I certainly didn't hate it. But neither did I like it to the degree personally anticipated.As was to be fully expected, co-leads Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal each deliver solid performances in ""Nocturnal Animals"". Their portrayals of estranged ex-spouses who may or may not reunite as a couple certainly succeeds in maintaining your interest until the end. Unfortunately, just not overabundantly so in this unusually presented tale of revenge by literature. That'll make sense if you've seen or plan to catch the flick.The consistently compelling Michael Shannon nearly manages to steal everyone's thunder here as a brusque, chain-smoking veteran West Texas lawman. His no-B.S. Bobby Andes chooses to go out not with a whimper but with a big ol' bang at the tail end of an all-consuming career. It is Shannon's luminous immersion in his colorfully quirky character that ultimately serves as a shining beacon upon this assorted cast of ""Nocturnal Animals""."
" Shallow Modernism in a Glossy Sheen...Compelling But Not Completely Cohesive
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,7,"The Opening Credits Scene is so Pretentiously ""In Your Face"" and ""Heavy"" Handed, that the Antiquated Carnival 'Midway"" Display, as Irony, may have some Folks Exiting before the Introduction Ends.That seems to be of No Concern to Director Tom Ford because He Thinks there are so many Beautifully Framed and Presented Scenes to come that all will be Forgiven. Maybe. Maybe Not.The Film is Attractive on the Surface as its Exposes the Underbelly of some Shallow Pretty People and some Dumb as Dirt Nocturnal Texas Animals. It's Three Stories and Timelines Interwoven from the Romance and Breakup of Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal.One of the Three is ""Fiction"" within Fiction and is a Visualization of a Book, by Gyllenhall. He sent the ""Proofs"" to the Estranged Adams and Dedicates it to Her. This Part of the Movie Introduces Michael Shannon as a Cop and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a Nasty Villain, both give Riveting and Unsettling Performances.Overall, it is a Compelling Neo-Noir that Borrows a Great Deal from Modern Tropes and Trends in the Genre but is Framed in Ford's Personal Preference for Glossy Sheen.The Film isn't very Profound or Convincing in what it's Trying to Say or in its Narrative Structure that keeps it from becoming as ""Deep"" or Insightful about the Modernism it is Presenting as a Stage for Social Commentary."
" Devastatingly good
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,9,"This superbly crafted movie must be one of the best I have seen for a long time.The story line,photography,characterisation and story within a story is unique and gripping from start to finish.The opening scenes and the exploration of the female and male bodies and the scenes of violence reminiscent of Straw Dogs (Sam Peckinpah).Even at the 95 minute stage of the 116 minute running time it is difficult to guess what the denouement is going to be. The scene in the art gallery with an art piece saying REVENGE and the use of white on white continues the aura of mystery and suspense.Essentially, this is a story of romance and violence with a lot of twists and turns thrown in.This is Tom Ford's second movie after a gap of 7 years and bears all the hallmarks of his first - beautifully filmed, great plot and superb story line which holds the viewer from start to finish.Watch it and watch it again."
" 2 hours of my life - wasted
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,1,"After ''Arrival'', my thought was - there can not be worse movie than that. But, this one - oh boy, how wrong I was.Amy Adams - one great actress. I still can not figure out why she takes roles in movies like this one.There is a chance I would like this movie if I was high, or maybe, drunk. But, sober, and with perfectly clear mind, I can not figure out what is going on in this ''piece of art''. There are not words to describe this. And, for the record, I made IMDb account just to give 1 star to this disaster called ''movie''. Terrible, terrible, terrible!!!"
" Sleepless in L.A.
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,8,"If the tagline for this film went something like 'Woman reads book' then it's likely only the most hardened of cinephile would even consider giving it attention. However, attention is just what 'Nocturnal Animals' deserves, and then some. Opening with the strangest - not to mention explicit - set of credits (overweight nude dancers wearing little more than majorett hats and their vanity) we meet Susan (Amy Adams), an icily cold gallery artist whose latest opening leaves her feeling unfulfilled and lonely in the absence of husband Hutton (Arnie Hammer), an art buyer who we learn spends much of his waking life travelling from one side of America to the other in the vain hope of bolstering a struggling business (he's also screwing his PA, of which Susan learns thanks to a careless bellboy remark later that night). As if her depression couldn't get any deeper, a mysterious package contains the manuscript to a book called 'Nocturnal Animals', written by - and dedicated to her - by former husband Edward. What elapses are two stories told in parallel: first, Susan's emotional journey as she reads the novel and recalls the rise and fall of her twenty-year dead marriage; secondly is the plot of 'Nocturnal Animals' novel: a revenge tragedy in which Tony (Jake Gyllenhaal, also Edward Sheffield) and his family set across Texas on a roadtrip, only to be railroaded by a bunch of hillbillies led by Ray (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) resulting in the abduction and subsequent rape and murder of Tony's wife and daughter.It is the bulk of this second story that not only provides much of the plot of 'Nocturnal Animals', but also an insight into the mindset of an author who has chosen such a violent and personal story to dedicate to his ex-wife. As we learn during Susan's flashbacks, husband Edward was a talented but passionless writer, seen by Susan's bigoted mother (Laura Linney) as weak - following the death of his father - and sensitive by Susan until she grows tired of the literary onanism that presages the collapse of their marriage. Delicate Edward does not take well to her criticism, accusing her of lacking any creative desire despite her Art/History major, and as the pair go their separate ways, Susan discover she is pregnant and is supported by second husband Hutton to abort it before Edward finds out. However, as they leave the clinic, Edward is there, and the seeds of his novel are planted. 'Nocturnal Animals' is then an allegorical story of the collapse of a relationship, and the way it makes a humdrum writer of self-absorbed fiction into one whose rhetoric not only cuts deep but has Susan confront some long-buried realisations about herself and the choices she has made.Writer/director Tom Ford skilfully weaves the two stories from Austin Wright's source novel 'Tony and Susan', depicting the fictional Tom as an emasculated character whose weakness and self-doubt leads to the capture and death of his family. At times Ford's subtext is oblique - when the bodies of his wife and daughter are discovered, they not only recall the 'dead' exhibits of Susan's gallery, but also the sleeping bodies of her daughter and her lover whom she calls in the middle of the night to seek motherly assurance. He also persists with the notion that, despite being absent in the real-life world of Susan in the present day, the two are still inextricably linked: when Susan bathes in the vain hope of encouraging elusive sleep, so Tom showers in a motel following his harrowing night on the cold and bleak highways of Texas' deserts. Investigating officer Bobby (Michael Shannon) himself appears to represent Edward's absent father in his novel: both offering paternal reassurance cruelly cut off by death and illness. In his role as the Texan deputy, Shannon is magnificent, tracing the slow decline from embittered and dogged investigator to vigilantist as the cancer wrecking his body determines him to ensure that his last case will not join a long list of technical loophole justice.Gyllenhall is likewise adept at tracing the picked upon and oppressed Tony into the cold-eyed avenger whose life was destroyed one fatal night. The final act of 'Nocturnal Animals' literary voyage is a masterclass in tension and suspense, finally granted the cathartic resolution that it has been screaming out for since its opening pages. But perhaps it's Adams herself who gives the most nuanced of performances, trapped in a loveless marriage and surrounded by a sumptuous yet soulless home, who comes to accept that she gave up on the man she loved from high-school and whose literary prowess has now held her capture during one long, sleepless night. For a woman who only found creativity by depicting such cold and brutal images of life's finality, the fact that Edward has himself sent her a love-letter of such violent and senseless clarity unites them despite their decades-long separation. His own 'weakness' lost both a wife and unborn child, much as Tony's inability to channel his own alpha-male authority in the face of redneck violence robbed him of a wife and daughter. Ultimately Susan is condemned to the life she chose twenty years previously, sat bereft in a restaurant in the flawed belief that Edward will join her for a re-conciliatory dinner. Of course, he never comes, giving 'Nocturnal Animals' its coda: art imitates life. And a broken marriage here has left both parties with a vacuous hole at the centre of their emotional lives."
" Stabbing you in the heart and twisting the knife until the last scene
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,10,"A very beautiful and a very evil movie at the same time. Gripping and disturbing from the first moment, until the last scene. It's beautifully shot, stylish and well acted which is not so common these days. It's a very violent movie but despite the fact it's quite realistic and gritty at times, it still makes the viewer feel slightly detached, it has this melancholic feel of Lynch movies. Beautifully sarcastic and exposing the lowest human instincts in a very cinematic manner. The last scene just wins the movie for me. Just watch it!"
" Fantastic
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,10,"Movie story is very nice.The acting of 2 main actor/actress are just too good. I just can't leave my eyes for second. I love how the story is telling by Tom Ford. Every frame is just beautiful beside a fantastic storyline. Thank you, definitely 1 of the best film of year for me."
" Nasty and Pointless Exercise in Style Over Substance
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,5,"This deeply unpleasant movie is evidence that fashion designer turned movie director Tom Ford does not have solid cinematic instincts.I felt this way about his previous directorial effort, ""A Single Man,"" and I feel it about ""Nocturnal Animals."" This film reeks of a director trying much too hard to force an artistic sensibility that doesn't know how to marry itself to the material it's imposed upon. We therefore get a lot of style and mighty little substance.It doesn't help that the substance we do get is either nasty and pointless, like the movie (or book) within the movie that finds Jake Gyllenhaal seeking revenge against the man who brutally raped and murdered his wife and daughter; or dull and pointless, like the listless scenes featuring Amy Adams moping around and lamenting the man who got away, the author (also played by Gyllenhaal) of the book just mentioned. The dramatization of the book is torture porn; the rest is just boring. For us to care about a failed relationship, we have to understand what was so great about the relationship in the first place, which we never see, and we have to care about the people in the relationship, who we don't really ever learn anything about.Michael Shannon plays a sadistic sheriff and received an Oscar nomination for making crazy for the umpteenth time in his career. The lead bad guy is played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, whose most memorable scene finds him sitting buck naked on a toilet. I almost wish he had been nominated for an Oscar as well so that this could have been used as his nomination clip.Grade: C"
" Unnecessary and disturbing Violence scenes, avoid it .
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,2,"I think a movie should enlighten, take you to other worlds and minds or at least entertain you. But not to take you to one of the worst nightmares please! Why! I should stop seeing the film as it showed the first signs of unnecessary violence and a general gray and sad tone. But I followed until I was exposed to the second grotesque scene when I finally quit. So I confess I am unable to make a complete and round critic.In the Storyline or plot should be a warning but there is not, Why to expose the mind to such terrible and disturbing scenes so explicit. There are elegant ways to tell stories without gore exposure.It completely affected my soul, I might be very sensitive, but I couldn't sleep, as much that I am at 4 in the morning warning NOT TO SEE this film."
" I was involved into this movie, but i didn't get it
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,8,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Nocturnal Animals"" (2016) is one of the most strangest movies I've seen in a while. I liked what i saw, but i didn't get it at the end. There are two stories here, one with a women and her surrounding in a some sort of fashion world, where great actors like Michael Sheen pop up on screen for 2 minutes and then disappears. The other is about the same woman reading a book sent by her ex husband which contains a gritty story totally different from our prime story. Or isn't? I loved the second story, which could have (and did work) as a superb thriller. Performances in a ""second"" story were great by everyone involved, especially by a great Michael Shannon who won Oscar nomination here - superb acting. But i wasn't confused when even he suddenly disappeared from screen - this happened a lot in this movie. So you think these two stories will collide somehow by the end? Well if they did, i didn't get it.Overall, i was involved into ""Nocturnal Animals"" for its good script (but not a story overall), absolutely superb performances and very good cinematography. But i didn't get the outcome. If there even was one..."
" Expertly crafted crime psychodrama
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"Seven year after fashion designer Tom Ford surprised everyone by delivering a tender, stylish romance with A Single Man, the writer/director returns for another tale of romantic exploration tinged with danger and sadness. Adapted from Austin Wright's 1993 novel Tony and Susan and renamed Nocturnal Animals for the screen, Ford expertly weaves three narratives, each with their unique look, tone and mood, into a brooding character study. One of the few criticisms thrown at A Single Man was its tendency to place style above substance, but I disagreed at the time, and offer Nocturnal Animals as proof that Ford is a skilled director who balances aesthetic and narrative seamlessly, and often to devastating effect.The film opens with shocking images of obese women dancing provocatively, and naked, in front of the camera. It's the opening of artist Susan Morrow's (Amy Adams) latest work, and it's a hit amongst the champagne-guzzlers who occupy the room. Susan seems to have everything: a lavish, modern mansion; a wardrobe full of expensive clothes; and a dashing (and rich) husband in Hutton (Armie Hammer). Everything, that is, other than happiness. At a dinner with her pompous artists friends (including a scene-stealing Michael Sheen), she voices her concerns about her husband's suspected affairs and her struggle to take herself seriously in her line of work. As Hutton jets off on a business trip, Susan is home alone when she receives a package from her ex-husband Tony (Jake Gyllenhaal). It's a draft of his finished novel, called Nocturnal Animals.There a multiple stories within the film, and we are transported into the novel as Susan reads it. It begins with a family driving down a deserted highway at night when they are suddenly run off the road by a group of rednecks. The father (also Gyllenhaal) attempts to diffuse the situation by offering to pay for the damages, but the hooligans, headed by the psychopathic Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor- Johnson) wind up kidnapping the wife and daughter. The further this dark, violent tale takes us, the clearer it becomes that it is mirroring Susan's reality, and that there may be a hidden message in there somewhere. Is Tony f*****g with his ex-wife for a prior incident, or could it be his bizarre way of trying to win back her affections? Either way, this fictional narrative clearly holds the key to unravelling the couple's part turmoil, and the mindset of both Tony and Susan after their marriage fell apart.The performances are impressive throughout. Adams demands your attention whenever she graces the screen, expressing the most powerful of emotions with the subtlest of facial movements. Michael Shannon, who was shockingly the only one of the four leads to receive an Oscar nod, is particularly memorable as a long-past- giving-a-f**k Texan lawman riddled with cancer. Yet it's Ford who emerges as the star, delivering an expertly crafted crime psychodrama that is both a curious study of the grotesque bourgeois and a lean, mean Texas revenge thriller. While it's certainly true that the male characters are much more layered than the females, the film received unfair accusations of misogyny upon its release, which may explain its absence from the major categories during awards season. It's a shame, as Nocturnal Animals deserves some recognition for its intoxicating cocktail of Hitchcockian tension, gritty human drama, and decadent visuals."
" Nocturnal Animals impressive performances, direction, and script. But the film is only worth seeing once.
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,6,"Nocturnal Animals is a mind twister that may throw off viewers if they walk out to the bathroom and miss a scene. It may not be for everyone with the direction the film is trying to take. Some may find it boring, disturbing or intrigued with the psychological thriller direction. I found the movie to be quite fair with a great cast ensemble, some visually tone direction, and a plot that would be difficult to discuss without giving away spoilers. Director Tom Ford did deliver a good script based on a novel. The plot follows gallery owner Susan (Amy Adams) when she receives a novel called Nocturnal Animals which she becomes obsessed and raw with emotions after reading it. Meanwhile, Tony (Jake Gyllenhaal) is going on a family vacation with his wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and their teenage daughter. On a road trip across Texas, they get run off the road by Ray (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his two men. Everything gets taken for the worse, when Tony and the Detective Bobby (Michael Shannon) are on the hunt for these men and to find Tony's wife and daughter. If you enjoy films that makes you think and realize between the two narratives structure and how they relate. Then, you may find the film to be worthy. If you don't, I would not recommend it. The concept idea playing with the whole story within a story was pretty neat. The script delivered a good structure with the two stories. This is one film with a lot of memorable actors in the film like Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Isla Fisher, Armie Hammer, and Michael Sheen. Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal gave some powerful emotional performances with their characters. It had some raw emotions, which can be quite hard to watch. And some frustrating moments with characters choices. Nocturnal Animals is a fair psychological thriller film; has a neat concept idea of story within a story and leaves open for interpretations for many viewers. Has a variety of talented cast in the film and highlighted performances from Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal."
" Style in search of substance, a few ideas in search of a real story
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,5,"I'm gonna go full-spoiler mode, but I don't think there's anything to spoil.You can't imagine how disappointed I was after hearing all the hype. This is not a terrible movie, because despite the run-time, it's barely a movie.It feels like an unfinished version of the film. It's like a long, long teaser that doesn't tell you anything, but gives you the mood of the story. The acting is great, the cinematography is great, but where's the story?It's a story in a story, but neither of them have enough of them to be interesting. Imagine Inception, a dream within a dream, but in it DiCaprio suffers from insomnia, so he makes himself some hot cocoa, reads a bit from some novel and sleeps. And then does that in the second layer. Am I exaggerating? A little. Replace hot cocoa with whiskey, replace novel with manuscript and that's what you get. Okay, the story in the novel has more substance, but it's just a generic rape- revenge story. There's no deeper meanings here. Family travel south. Get attacked by hillbillies. Then it's revenge. Why couldn't that be the whole story? Because it's not interesting enough. So is the story outside the novel interesting? No, not really. Two mediocre stories don't make a great story.It's more film school material than anything."
" Fantastic and beautifully shot
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,9,"I loved this movie, I'm not into fashion and I had no idea who Tom Ford was, but I thought it was compelling, bittersweet, and mature story telling. Maybe the thematic colour and art direction was a bit much for some, but I loved it.Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhall and Michael Shannon all did brilliantly and although there are a few jumps between time lines, I never felt lost (and I'm always that person!). It might not be the most unique story ever told, but it was a classic told beautifully right to the end."
" Doesn't work
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,5,"This is a movie that tells two stories in parallel where even though the stories are not related, one story is supposed to complement the other, and together the two stories become one bigger story.Unfortunately that didn't happen. The two unrelated stories remained unrelated. In addition, each story is not that interesting.When I finished the movie, I had no idea what the bigger story is supposed to be.This reminds me of abstract art. The artist randomly splashes some paint on the canvas and hopes the viewers find some deep meaning. Regular people just see a random splash of paint but of course some people claim they see something deeper."
" Just great....Brilliant screenplay!
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,10,"I'd just love this screenplay, I've been searching for a story like this for a long time, a story with a strong message behind and, at the same time, containing lots of emotion in the middle. Nocturnal Animals deserves a 10 with no doubt it has just thrilled me out for the reasons I'd mention before. The parallelism between the novel (written by Edward) and the real life during the movie is just brilliant and so is the final. I don't want to reveal anything else I just wanted to give my congrats the director (Tom Ford) and all the actors whose plays were amazing, I also would like to refer that the orchestral was beautiful too so congratulations Abel Korzeniowski. I highly recommend this motion picture and advise everyone to watch it without missing any detail (this one requires it)!"
" Style & Flash - but no substance
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,6,"I mostly enjoyed this movie. It was hard to follow at times, switching back and forth between the story lines. Stylistically the movie is impeccable. The art, the costumes were dazzlingly. The herky jerky nature of the storytelling was the downfall for me. That and the ending. Is it too much to ask for a definitive ending? After two hours of watching the director's vision - I want an ending!"
" Astonishing movie
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,10,"First, acting is simply extraordinary and JG such a wonderful actor, you just never feel anything unnatural in any way, rare enough to be mentioned according to me. Second, the merging of the 2 stories is made in such a clever and inspired way, you just admire the talent behind it. Third, the allegory built in the movie, and contained in the book I guess, of course, is so meaningful and powerful that is strikes you with no way of escaping its iron grasp when you get it, except writing a review like this, maybe :) Not to forget the music, haunting beauty ..."
" Extremely Thought Provoking
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,8,Tom Ford delivers. Wow. VERY real. A diverse group of stereotypical and non-stereotypical human beings both physically and emotionally exposed for all of us to clearly see and easily use to self judge. All seven deadly sins wonderfully portrayed and beautifully played out. 21st addictions toujour. In front and behind the facades; whats not to like? Yum!
" An effective art-house thriller not destined to be a classic.
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,7,"My impressions in list format:PROS1) The acting performances were top notch, and the roles were well cast. 2) The cinematography is especially well done. 3) The plot, and especially the sense of mystery, was compelling. I was genuinely interested in the story's progression. CONS1) The opening scene with the incredibly unappealing nude dancers was not welcome. I didn't find it brave or interesting as some critics have. I also think these same critics would have a huge problem with the scene if the dancers were worthy of Playboy. 2) The film, maybe intentionally, is emotionally distant. It works for the story, but it's not especially moving, but the film also isn't good enough to be haunting, either. In summary, I think Nocturnal Animals is a very good movie, especially if you like the neo-noir style, but I don't see it attaining cult classic status in the long run -- at least not in my library."
" Took me by surprise because I wasn't quite paying full attention
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,8,So many movies have twists at the end and many people don't really appreciate them anymore. I was working while watching this movie and the twist took me surprise. If you didn't like this movie because she was stood up in the end and the movie ended abruptly- you should re-watch it because your paying less attention than me.
" Provoking after days...
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,7,"I am a psychological thriller fan, and I find the ones that keep me thinking and analyzing after watching are the best! My husband and I watched this movie the other night and some of the scenes were tough to watch emotionally. That night we gave this a chance, the movie ended and I looked and him and started complaining. I hated it. I didn't get it... I had so many questions.The next day I found myself thinking about it more and it sparked conversations between us and we found ourselves bringing the movie up for days. The more we discussed it the more we realized what a chilling, subtle and cold masterpiece this was. It is beautiful, artsy but also thought provoking that leaves you hollow inside as you feel for the characters. I want to watch it again and enjoy it more!"
" Banal revenge story given Botox
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,2,"Tom Ford should stick to fashion. This is a dressed-up version of your typical revenge story smoothed out with some glossy production design. We have your typically (TV-like) young, beautiful and preposterously successful artist/pedant sorts coming to terms with their worst nightmares, vicariously. The story within the story dominates, which undercuts the kinder, gentler revenge of the elites. And the story inside is your typical cartoonish take on the ""lower classes"", here it being West Texas psychotic ruffians. Ford decides to forego any gruesome renditions of the extreme violence; that is left to ominously delivered dialogue by Sheen's rogue cop. What you're left with is workman-like filmmaking (more suited to your lower budget cable TV networks) with some big stars in it with not much more to do than deliver less than stellar dialogue and swim around in underdeveloped characters. Ford draws out its tepid ending so much that the devastating effect he planned on leaves one to think, ""so what?"""
" Revenge in a Parallel World
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,8,"Super thriller!High class businesswoman cheats on her husband. His revenge is to write a novel that in effect brutalizes in fiction their situation to cause grief and remorse. Wonderful the way the parallel stories are woven together...Top rated performance all round especially by the baddies, and Michael Shannon-who plays a cop-steals the show.This is a stylish production and the main music, the song Logos,is haunting and beautiful:8/10."
" Just because you think of a good movie title ...
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,1,"Spoiler alertIt's a book inside of a movie inside of a rape scene. Another pretentious bland film where you choose your own narrative to piece the scenes together. I don't know about all of you, but I work for a living, and I'd like my movie watching experience to be relaxing and entertaining. If I wanted to watch an art house film, I'd go to a gallery or some lame hipster house party --where movies like these are projected on the wall while bad music blares and dudes with flannel shirts and beards (much like Tony) are drinking pabst blue and acting like the film is so ""deep"" and ""stunningly beautiful"". When in reality, all this movie does is aestheticize violence against women. Cool story bro."
" Beautifully done
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,9,"I rated this on the higher scale because you have to ""think"" while watching and try to understand the subtleties. Everything but the ending is pretty much self-explanatory or so you think, until the very last shot. I was confused until I watched the bonus part and had what I now know to be the full width/breath of the movie. It should've received much more recognition at all of the Award shows. Jake, Michael & Amy do a wonderful job wrapping you in and around a very difficult path. Ultimately it will leave you with a better understanding of ""the grass is not always greener on the other side"" along with a few Karma hits, here and there."
" A twisted tale
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,9,"A twisted story running in book and in real live simultaneously ""Nocturnal Animals"" starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams is a very beautiful love story. The novel written by Mr. Jake was devastating and showed a man who was weak sorry realistic once his wife and daughter were brutally raped and murdered by the hitch hikers in the outer region of Texas turned into aggressive and took the revenge of his family from the murderers was very beautifully portrayed. In real life, these kinds of movies bring out a lesson, and the same has been displayed well in this film.

" This. Movie. Was. Awful.
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,1,"**SPOILERS** Okay, so here's the thing. If you look at my personal ratings of movies, you'll probably notice I'm VERY easy to please. I often feel guilty because I give too many movies a rating of 8-10, when the average is about a 6.5. I like movies. I watch a movie to be entertained, and if a movie does a good job of entertaining me, I like to give positive ratings... So I want to repeat, I am NOT hard to please. I'm very easy. That being said, most of my ratings are just that, a rating. Very rarely will I actually type out a review. I'm doing so now as a plea to other individuals out there, do NOT watch this movie, or rather, do NOT waste 2 hours of your life watching a miserable story play out... This couldn't be worse. What kind of sicko decides to make an 'artsy' movie out of every mans/husbands/fathers worst nightmare? Why did I actually continue watching?! I judge myself for putting up with it. I mean come on, I should have given in and turned it off when 15 minutes into the movie, I'm watching some redneck scumbags drag a mans wife and daughter away from their car to do potentially terrible things while the father/husband does essentially nothing to stop the perpetrators. But no, I kept on going. So then I should have turned it off 15 minutes later when you find the mans wife and daughter lying dead and naked, draped together in a death embrace (is this supposed to be 'beautiful' or 'artistic'?!). So his wife and daughter were raped and murdered... NOW is where I stopped watching, right? No, I kept going. Shame on me. So then I get to watch the utterly slow drama of how the perpetrators are eventually found by a dying police officer, and 'revenge' (if you want to call it that) is had in the end, only to then die in the process of carrying out that revenge... Then we get to watch the main character sip wine in a restaurant for like 3 minutes for no reason whatsoever, aaaaand cut to black, roll credits... REALLY!?!? I'm all for violent movies. I'm all for drama. Heck I'm even all for an artsy fartsy flick once in a while. But THIS garbage needs to be avoided by anyone looking to be entertained. If you are after a movie to be angered, bothered, tormented, and disgusted, then sure, go for it. But if you're like me and you enjoy watching movies to be entertained, do yourself a favor and move on to the next movie you've been curious about. All that being said, the ONE redeeming part of this movie is the acting. Great acting. But it's got a great cast, so I would expect nothing less... I just wish these great actors had chosen a different screenplay to lend their talent to."
" Pretty disappointing
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,4,"Really don't get all the fuss about this director. Yes, this film has a stellar cast and looks great but so do a lot of others. Where's the substance? Has he ever read a good script and actually learned something from it? Obviously not. Firstly, people can drool over the cinematography but the editing is quite annoying, art-house, too quick and erratic. Trying to be something it's not, too smart. Doesn't add anything. And as for the story, a film within a film? More like cutting back and forth but the connection is unnecessary, overused, blurred and contrived. Some parts lack plausibility, like him driving the cop everywhere. Don't they have police cars in West Texas? The pretentious arty types, so stereotypical. And this film drags, it could have been 10-15 minutes shorter. Including the last scene. Some poor directing choices all round when there are literally thousands of better ones out there."
" Can you forget what you think you know for 2 hours?
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,10,This movie is bloody great.Can we all just pretend for 2 hours that we don't actually know anything. Forget what you 'think' a movie should be. Open your mind like a beautiful flower and let the visuals pollinate you. A masterpiece that will stay with you for a long time after.Done.
" Ford Channels His Inner De Palma - Niiiiice!
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,9,"I will admit that I'm a sucker for this type of film. Multiple narratives, brooding violent thriller, polished 80's De Palma-esque.. yea, definitely a kid in the candy store moment.Nocturnal Animals is very clever. It uses one narrative to express the feelings of the characters in another. Ford's film looks absolutely fantastic. The pacing is perfect. I know not everyone will love it, mostly because it does not have a cookie-cutter Hollywood payoff. The shock-symbolism of the opening credits may be a bit much for some too - even me. It's like 1998's ""Great Expectations"" met 2016's ""Hell or High Water"". Speaking of, it just moved into the #2 spot ahead of the latter, as the 2nd best film I've seen from last year, 54 films through a watchlist of 89 films. It is fresh in my mind so I could flip-flop those back later. It will likely hold a top-5 spot when all is said and done.The film asks a lot of questions about fate, social classes, and the strength of men. The audience keeps questioning the reality and significance of the parallel narrative until after credits role. That's the aspect that put this in the 9 range for me.Worth another view, and soon. There's still a few more pieces of the puzzle I might have missed. A thought provoking, excellent film. Kudos to the entire cast and the director. If you want to watch a sharp, thought provoking thriller, look no further."
" Well executed thriller
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,8,"Nocturnal Animals has everything a good movie needs. A great cast, perfect scenery's, an intriguing story and above all it's told in the perfect timing, not rushed at all. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon are two actors are really like so seeing them playing in the same movie is just a joy for me to watch. They both gave away a great performance especially Michael Shannon. And if you like red haired vamps you will be delighted because with Amy Adams, Isla Fisher and Ellie Bamber you get three for one. Amy Adams is a delight to watch in Nocturnal Animals. By reading the novel her husband from 20 years ago wrote she relives in a way her story. It's a story in a story. A well written story with the right amount of suspense, especially in the beginning. Great directing from Tom Ford. Looking forward to watch his next movie. I really doubt this movie will get a lot of people with negative reviews like you always have with any other movie. I will definitely watch it again in the future."
" David Lynch smiles
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,7,"I almost feel bad about giving Nocturnal a rating this low. But the fact is, it doesn't move you to care about the characters; and that's the major failing here. It's not clever enough to get away with let's say a mind bending experience and so your almost left feeling cheated. It's evident that the first time director felt that the narrative was the most important piece here but a more genuine approach to relationship building between the main characters would have made the story line that much more powerful. Nocturnal wins in other ways though (direction, screenplay & cinematography). If you do end up liking this film, checkout Mulholland Drive or Lost highway. You just may blow a gasket."
" Film Within A Film Style Adds Pretension, Not Entertainment
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,7,"This film was a stylish sophisticated take on the demented ""Last House On The Left"" film of 1972, where a couple of people, (in this case a mother, father, and daughter, are the victims of some thugs who taunt, terrify, and eventually rape and kill the females. But by imagining these scenes as Amy Adams reading a manuscript makes the idea more ""intellectual"" or, as some critics would say, stylish, I think the film, which is often quite riveting and tense, would have been better if it had just been a straight-forward thriller, perhaps less original, but also more believable and less pretentious. Overall, not bad, but I had a disappointed feeling at the end, despite excellent performances, especially by Michael Shannon. Also, there is no real humor or warmth in the film, so it is hard to really connect to the characters emotionally, other than viscerally."
" Gyllenhaal Saves An Otherwise So-So Movie
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,6,"I'll be the first to admit that I'm not an Amy Adams fan. And this movie did nothing to change my mind. But, even having said that: this was a decent movie. Nothing earth shattering, but good.Amy Adams plays Susan Morrow, an unhappy art dealer with a cushy life. While trying to manage her new marriage she gets a manuscript from her ex-husband, Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal). As she reads the manuscript we see the book play out in the manner she imagines. The movie bounces back and forth between Susan's current life, her past life with Edward and her visions of the manuscript. It gets a little sloppy at times or intentionally nebulous when trying to discern if we are watching the past, present or her vision of the book. I don't think there was any intent to confuse, in fact I think that her imagination of the book was just who she saw the characters as and one of them happened to be the same as her ex-husband.Interestingly enough, the book and what was happening in that was far more riveting than what was going on in Susan Morrow's life. The story within the story will evoke some strong emotions. But, as can be inferred by my synopsis, the focus of this movie is Susan Morrow. The movie is more or less a drama with some thriller elements that spice things up. I wasn't terribly impressed with Amy Adams though Jake Gyllenhaal was excellent. I think Gyllenhaal made the movie watchable. Take him and his character away and this movie would have been a major snore."
" Good idea for a movie
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,6,"Yes it was stylish, but it was a long way from ""all style no substance."" The story within a story was good, even though not original. Gyllenhaal and Shannon made it a bit better than good.The two stories were woven together nicely.Adams did fine at middle-aged angst, but that story was of course boring, because all stories of middle-aged angst are boring. Some kind of actual plot here would have done this movie a world of good.The ending was so weak, I thought the movie makers must have gotten to that point and realized they didn't really have a main story, just a bunch of middle-aged angst. So they decided to get it over with as quickly as possible, always the best thing to do when dealing with middle- aged angst.If the movie had been written by grownups, he would have shown up reeking of happiness, not because that's the best revenge, but because he actually was happy. Their marriage would have been a fond but distant memory, an error of youth, a growth experience that really did make him a better writer, for which he is genuinely grateful, but hardly the big experience of his life. He would have found the love of his life, just didn't happen to marry her. Been there, done that.Then she would have been left with the ridiculousness of ever having imagined that it was all about her."
" I just didn't get it? SPOILER ALERT!!
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,5,"WTF? I was actually kinda liking it on a morbid depressin way but my mouth is still open. As if it wasn't depressing and disturbing enough to end it like that? I'm so annoyed about it. I don't know in what time frame it was. Obviously after, but got it so damn confusing in a show me more way, but afraid he was going to do exactly what he did and he did at the end, and mess it up even more for me! FAT beginning was stupid no matter what it meant for the movie just just annoying and intrusive. My heart was in pieces for her in the family in the car. Ripped me apart. The fear and desperstion for them busted right thru the screen! Sorry it it ended different I might have fave it a 9-2 for the opening but I hate it when the director decides to leave it with any possibilities at the end for you to figure out what happened and why it did come on be responsible here, Ford!! I'm hoping for an alternate ending, in my mind and some explanations damn it!!!?"
" Something Is Missing From This Film
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,5,"Based on my usual/previous film tastes, I should rank ""Nocturnal Animals"" much higher than this middle-of-the-road five stars. I generally tend to like films that are about something more than what is portrayed on the surface, and ""Nocturnal Animals"" certainly fits the bill in that regard. That being said, however, there is just something about this movie that left me feeling underwhelmed and perhaps even a little disappointed.For a basic plot summary, ""Nocturnal Animals"" tells the story of Susan (Amy Adams), a very successful art designer who ""has everything"": prestige...money...style/beauty...home. The problem? She rarely ever sleeps, and current husband Hutton (Armie Hammer) is never around. In short, she is very dissatisfied with her life. One day, she receives a manuscript from ex- husband Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal) that is dedicated to her. As she reads Edward's story (a tale depicted on screen as a man losing his wife and daughter in West Texas and hunting down the men who kidnapped them), she flashes back to her time spent with Edward in hopes of understanding why it is devoted to her.I'll start with the good: ""Nocturnal Animals"" is a rather fascinating film for the way in which it uses storytelling techniques to get its point across. It is heavy on allegory, as well as uses flashbacks and the visualization of a written narrative. Suffice it to say, there is a lot to unpack in terms of how the story is told. I like that inventiveness in film-making. Having a great cast doesn't hurt, either.I think the biggest problem I had with the film, however, is that it seemed like some of the stylistic choices only served to distract from what I feel should have been the main plot of the story. SPOILER ALERT (minor) here, but ""Nocturnal Animals"" really works when it tackles the themes of relationships and the power that artistic expression can have on real life events. That angle is a fascinating one. However, I felt as if director Tom Ford treated the film like a ""big reveal"" picture (when really it is not), using distraction that in this case actually detracted from the interesting points of the piece. Susan's lack of sleep is touched upon multiple times, but doesn't really add anything to the plot. The stylish, chic look of the picture seems to be a calling card too, but does it enhance the proceedings? I'd say no.To me, then, ""Nocturnal Animals"" is a film that I really want to like, but also can't because there is just so much to unpack and digest. Even when I try to unpack everything, though, it doesn't seem worth the effort, as I never felt connected enough to the main players (likely because of all the distractions I've outlined above).So, a ""perfectly down the middle"" five-star review is the best I can give ""Nocturnal Animals"" as a complete film. I appreciate the inventive storytelling approach, but the whole thing just never came together for me."
" Could have been good
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,4,"This film would have been better if it just stuck to the fictional story within, with some more work and plotting. That was the best part of this film. The ex-girlfriend parts were awful and pointless. Who cares about a bunch of rich art yuppies who were played terribly by the actors anyway. Gyllenhaal and Shannon were wasted in this and were the only high points in the whole thing."
" For all its emphasis, an utterly weak and painfully mundane plot.
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,2,"Digging around on Netflix and Vudu I have discovered films (that I had never heard of before) possessing great plots and actors with paramount meaning, that failed to reach their potential because they lacked equally skilled cinematographers, composers, arrangers, or sound effects. Nocturnal Animals indeed has great acting, cinematographers, composers, and an overall extremely talented production team... but a plot that could be described as tangential at best. I also found the random and rather large doses of nudity disconcerting for a movie that could have very well been PG- 13. People are raving about Tom Ford as if he was some kind of genius (calling the first 10 minutes of nudity 'art') for this work but alas I disagree. This movie made me think of an artist with only paint, a brush, and a canvas in his studio... passionately dancing, violently thrashing, and flinging paint onto his medium during this emphatic display of emotion. For all his elegance and technique, for all the thought and emotion he put into his work it simply doesn't make what lands on the canvas a moving or marvelous piece of art. The technique and method in producing the piece itself proves far more impressive than the finished product. I kept waiting the entire movie for some climax and thought 'Surely this is going to come together and blow my mind' but it didn't and worse ended with the most pitiful exchange. For all its' pomp and decadence, for all the great effort and clear talent involved in this production I was deeply disappointed to find the random haphazard plot that had just unfolded before me was just that...gurgling ramblings with no larger relatable meaning that tied into the anticlimactic conclusion. I've heard some discuss the satisfaction of seeing Susan end up with a meaningless life, cheating husband, etc But the story doesn't make Susan villain enough for the audience to care, or Edward hero or loved enough for us to be satisfied either. It seems to me only a petty person would be thrilled by this not knowing either of them. Sure there were 'hidden' meanings here and there parts that had full intention of speaking to the human soul, yet all this was wasted on a story line that simply didn't come together as a whole in the end. The only decipherable messages in this film are rife with clichés and the only feeling I was left with after the introduction and ending was immense disgust. I'm sure that there are idiots out there that would or have paid millions for ""art"" made from simply splashing elements onto a canvas; created methodically and deliberately out of chaos. In the end this film had no profound meaning and having not been inside the mind of the maker, onlookers can only imagine what it was supposed to mean, like taking an ink blot test. Were the same stretch of imagination necessary to perceive the amount of meaning in this plot needed to call this film revolutionary used in an ink blot test I imagine interpreter would likely believe the patient borderline delusional there is after all a fine line between delusion and genius. Perhaps that is what has some people so thrilled by this because the larger meaning is something left to the imagination of the viewer to create but with no real conclusion and the only recognizable theme being petty revenge within the 'real' plot, I was left rolling my eyes at the end. I was irritated that there are so many people out there who thought this was marvelous that I wasted an evening to watch it. I was also thoroughly disturbed at the terrible waste of talent on this film. I did learn one thing from this experience; I will never again give weight to the ratings without first scouring the written reviews. I will also likely avoid at all costs anything by Tom Ford or anything that remotely resembles this film."
" There was no love in this one. Merely cowardice of the moment and helplessness.
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,7,"Starts, outstandingly beautiful. Ends, in plain sight. Just like that.The journey is beautiful, intense, with constant uprising, which suddenly falls flat on it's own face.It never recovers.Tom doesn't even seem to try for recovery, perhaps because the point remains proved in the first 50minutes itself.Story was weak, like his previous work. Emotions, intact. Rest, accessory."
" Pseudo Intellectual Prattle
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,2,"When I saw the trailers for Nocturnal Animals in the theater I thought it would be a film I'd like to see. Generally I've enjoyed Amy Adams since I saw her as the irrepressible Gisele in Enchanted. However, since she became a Movie Star she's become less daring, choosing roles that seem more avant-garde but require less depth. Susan in Nocturnal Animals was such a role.It isn't so much that Amy Adams has become sterile in her performances, but this wasn't a great script either. Clearly Susan's ex husband Edward and his protagonist Tony were meant to represent the same man. In a flashback sequence Adam's Susan tells Edward he should write about something other than himself to which Edward replies all writers write about themselves. This exchange makes it clear, if it wasn't already, that Tony's ordeal in the desert with the death of his wife and daughter were a reflection of Edward's discovery of Susan's abortion and simultaneous infidelity.This film seem timely given today's conflation of victim with virtue, the greater you've been victimized the greater virtue you can claim. Susan's betrayal and divorce of Edward were no doubt horrible and difficult for Edward, but no more than what happens to millions of men each year, in that respect Edward is a member of a very large club. It does not rise to the level of horror a man would experience to be run off the road, have his wife and daughter kidnapped, raped, and murdered. Tony is a fictional victim in a fictional story. Edward may deserve sympathy for the callous treatment he received from Susan in their divorce, but sympathy does not equate to virtue and Edward definitely deserves no virtue from the suffering of his fictional protagonist Tony.That the film attempts to elevate victim to virtue is as strong a theme as revenge. In one scene Adams encounters Jena Malone in an art museum in front of a painting that contains the word ""Revenge"" painted in white letters on a black background. Nothing subtle here.Nocturnal Animals leaves us with a story that doesn't end so much as it just stops. The final frames of the film have Susan sitting in a restaurant with a waiter bringing her several drinks as she waits for an Edward who never shows. If failing to show up is virtuous Edwards greatest idea of revenge then Edward is the wimp Susan's mom said he was."
" Don't waste your time on this one
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,1,Worst movie I have seen in a long time! I had to fast forward through all the overweight naked and gross women at the start of the movie. Was that really supposed to be art? The rest of the movie was Predictable and ridiculously stupid. It was like watching 3 movies at the same time. Jake Gyllenhaal deserves a better movie and better role. Tom Ford needs to go back the drawing board
" A stylistic and shallow mess.
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,5,"Nocturnal Animals tackles a narrative challenge in telling three different stories interwoven together to create a portrait of a emotional experience. As our protagonist (played by Amy Adams) reads a disturbing story written by her ex-husband, we see their back story and by what means they're no longer together. The films manages to keep its narrative not only clear but intensely gripping despite the difficult undertaking of managing three separate stories. I felt thoroughly fixated on every scene wondering how all these stories would end and eventually tie together. The scenes involving the most violent and menacing content were extremely effective and were handled with the utmost seriousness and realism. Those scenes truly do frighten and chill. Much of the scare is also due to some incredible performances by Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Aaron-Taylor Johnson, and especially by Michael Shannon. Personally, these stellar performances by the cast make this movie captivating to watch since the cast fully utilized their potential.All that being said, what makes this film fail on a personal level has to do with unfulfilled potential in the script. Not to be confused the movie is written quite well but payoff for everything bizarre that's happening was exceptionally unsatisfying. Yes, the ending is intentionally ambiguous but not apparent substance or ""why"" I was really watching this wasn't visible in the least. The whole ""style over substance"" issue was apparent from the bizarre opening credits and the ending which seemed to indicate that not only do we as the audience not know why but the filmmakers maybe didn't know either. It felt as if the beginning went nowhere, the middle went everywhere, and the end made a u-turn back to nowhere. With a film that really didn't have much to say, it's hard to recommend this to anyone who really values a good 2 hours. For someone looking to pass the time, it might be worth seeing at least once for some amazing performances and carefully crafted and layered narrative. However, it's not enough to make up for the lack of any substance or intention behind the movie."
" Beware
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,1,"One of the most utterly revolting movies ever made--so well done it sticks in your craw and becomes impossible to extricate. One might also say it is visually brilliant with a gripping, narrative impact that won't let go. But you might not want such a sick, haunting nightmare to inspire your inner movie maker into producing alternate revenge/prevention scenarios--though you might. A paean to the glorified triumph of the grotesque over love and beauty. And, oh yeah, it contains an explicit invocation of and underlying motivation characterized by the key word 'devastating,' more than effective writing, direction and acting and two brilliant works of art."
" Just became my joint 1st No. 1 movie
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie! As much as I love Taxi Driver! A story so great, it had me at the edge of my seat from the beginning. Amy Adams receives a package and inside it is a book my her ex husband dedicated to her. As she settles down and starts reading the book a harrowing, scary, cringeworthy story starts taking shape. The great thing about this movie is that you can connect with these characters and sympathize, and hate them. Two overlapping story takes place in this movie and the director does a great job weaving it together.Jake Gyllenhal-the man who can make any movie good. Give him a good story and he will make it a earth shattering experience as he has done time and over again. I don't need to say how good he was in Nightcrawler or Prisoners or Enemy or even Southpaw. Southpaw was an average story but Jake made it a great movie. I have been a fan of this man for a long time and I have made it a habit to watch anything he does. Amy Adams is equally interesting, she carries herself well as we have come to expect that from her. She shows a vulnerability and cold hearted side of the character which makes it even more attention grabbing. Let's got the reason why I'm here....MICHAEL SHANNON-the greatest character actor to have ever graced the silver screen. I am in awe of this man, the way he makes me hate him and love him at the same time. 99 Homes, Midnight Special, Mud, Boardwalk Empire...they are just some of the greatest acted movies ever. So, Michael Shannon- thanks!Just go watch it...it's great!"
" Intriguing & thought-provoking
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,9,"Potential spoiler ahead... I found this movie to be suspenseful and interesting to watch. Initially, slow to understand the purpose, a little bit of bouncing around between fact and fiction within the movie itself, but all makes sense in the end. I also found this movie to be both frustrating to watch and relatable at the same time in the sense that if I put myself in the main characters shoes, namely Jake Gyllenhaall's fictional character (and by fictional, I mean fictional within the movie). It makes you wonder what you would do in a situation of great stress and threat to your family. The ending is a bit of a ""choose your own adventure"" type of scenario. It leaves a lot of unanswered questions, but you are likely to form your own conclusion as to why it ended the way it did. It takes a little bit of thought, but it makes sense. After throwing a small temper tantrum at the end, I determined that the reason for the rather abrupt ending was self evident. Overall, I very much enjoyed the film, and it made me really think about what I would do if put in a similar circumstance, both on the fiction within the fiction side, and within the main characters of the movie. That said, I give it a solid 9 out of 10.Let me also add that this movie made me decide that if I ever go on a road trip with my wife and children, I'm going to either carry a gun, or a long metal object to defend my family!"
" I want my 2 hours back
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,1,"Was fairly bored after 20 minutes, but wanted to give it a chance. I should have stuck with my instincts. You keep waiting for it to get good, but it never does, then it ends. Having good visuals and acting are nice if they are added to a good story. This is a well made piece of junk. This movie made me feel like I had been taken for a long ride across the street."
" sometimes ugliness can be beautiful
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,9,"Nocturnal Animals is a beautiful movie in many ways, but it is also somewhat of an acquired taste. If someone were to come up to me and say ""I hated this movie"" I would completely understand. The subject matter is vile and harsh, the images contained are violent, ugly, offensive and hateful. Still, sometimes ugliness can be beautiful and the contrast of fashion designer Tom Ford's images are totally effective. Some of the most well dressed, beautiful people and locations are on display in this desert mystery about a book reading that imitates the former marriage of Amy Adams character. Which part of the movie is real and which part is imagined, or is it all just a horrible nightmare?"
" Good Movie, Poor Book Adaptation (some spoilers)
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,7,"This is a good movie - suspenseful and effective. It is also based on a book that is extremely good - Tony and Susan. Unfortunately, there are a couple of changes made in the film that make the meaning of the book obscure. Also, there are some elements that - I guess - would be attributable to director/screenwriter Tom Ford, who should, perhaps, stick to fashion design. Both the movie and the book are really stories within stories - the book pulls this off most effectively, Ford pulls it off very poorly, mainly because of a wrong-headed casting choice.The main story is about Susan Morrow (Adams), who owns an art gallery. Her husband Hutton (Hammer) is a businessman who travels a great deal (and appears to be cheating on Susan). This is Susan's second marriage, her first one being to Edward Sheffield, an aspiring writer Susan ultimately loses faith in; she begins an affair with Hutton, whom she marries after divorcing Edward.Many years after their divorce, Edward sends Susan a copy of a manuscript, Nocturnal Animals, that is about to be published - Edward wants Susan to read the book. This is where the story within a story takes place. The book is about English Professor Tony Hastings, who is on vacation with his wife and teenage daughter. His wife and daughter are kidnapped right in front of him, and he is driven to an isolated location where he is expected to be killed. He manages to escape, however, is able to contact police, and the search for the kidnappers and Tony's family is begun.{Possible SPOILERS begin here}The point of the (real) book was that Susan and the character Tony are alike in that they have no self respect. Susan leaves the man she loves to marry someone who ultimately has no love for her and basically abandons her - and she accepts that. Tony stands by while he, his wife and daughter are terrorized, and basically allows the ruffians to kidnap his family while he lets it happen. Ford blows the Susan-Tony connection by casting Jake Gyllenhaal as both Edward Sheffield and Tony Hastings. Totally inadequate on two counts: we're never sure when we are watching Edward and when we are watching Tony; using Gyllenhaal in the two roles causes a disconnect between the Tony character and Susan.The roles are structured wrongly. Tony in the film fights to stop the kidnapping, while in the book he simply lets it happen. Susan in the book knows what is going on around her, and knows that no one has an inkling of respect for her, but she allows that - while the film Susan is more like a totally clueless person who is simply ineffectual.Ford does try to identify (lack of) self-respect as the theme in the opening sequence of the film, which involves grossly obese nude women dancing, but a sense of disgust overwhelms the effort.I place full blame for the inadequacies in this film on Tom Ford. Gyllenhaal, Adams, and the rest of the cast (especially Michael Shannon as the dying sheriff Bobby Andes) give very serviceable performances. They are all let down, however, by a mediocre vision of how to translate a complex book into a 2-hour movie."
" Everyone has a Nocturnal Animal inside...
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,9,"What is a Nocturnal Animal?It is a being that can not sleep at night, that can not rest, that can not have peace. It's always hunting, it is never satisfied. You can have everything and still feel that something is missing.Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) is a Nocturnal Animal, she knows it, she feels it. Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) knows it too. This is the real matter of this film. The parallel story in Edward's novel, puts another Nocturnal Animal on the play, Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who represents in the most brutally way, the same actions taken for Susan Morrow.You can think is a Story about Revenge, but if you remember how difficult it is to see your worst side, inside you, maybe you can watch the movie as a kind of lesson. A lesson to be felt and to be learned, without any guarantee the people, the Nocturnal Animals, understand it - don't forget the final look of Susan, the expression on her eyes. We know she felt the lesson but, Did she really understand?.Wonderful movie, excellent Direction, every Performance was gorgeous. Marvelous Art Direction and Cinematography.If you want to learn how to detect Nocturnal Animals and some of their reasons... Watch this movie... Twice if you can or you bear it..."

",2017-03-20 00:00:00,7,"1284/5000 I had been waiting a long time to see this movie. I really like the actress, I had heard a lot and well from this movie. The wait was worth it, but it leaves me half.I am convinced that the choice of Amy Adams is basically for box office reasons. Your cache is not too high yet, but it is already public. It's not that I do not like her in the film, the other way around is fine, telling what her role can offer, which is very little. The movie is on the other side.Michael Shannon is great. So was Jake Gyllenhaal. They both carry the movie.I like the point of view that it offers and the question that it entails, it brings with it a very interesting debate and that I have already heard in the people in the street, a few times. The question of whether you are dying, what would you do with the time you have left?You have a great picture. It serves to narrate and it is also pretty.I can not say the same thing about management in terms of planning. It does not have nice and narrative plans, they are simple. Otherwise, the movie drags you and engulfs you, but this leaves the end like that, I do not like it. It's the biggest mistake I see in the movie, which is so open.It's a good thriller, well done. You have a great time watching it, it's good to see good cinemaSpoiler:There comes a time when you see that you have a daughter, go script failure, but how can this character come out at this point and only for a sequence. I thought it was the husband and the lover took it."

",2017-03-20 00:00:00,5,"The first 20 or so minutes are tough to watch. Why? Let's start with the opening credits, which also show obese women naked, full frontal and writhing to God knows what. Then we see other naked obese women on white platforms and we see art patrons milling around. We get it. It's an art gallery show. Later we see road rage when one car bumps the other car off the road. Arguments and shoving abound and women are taken hostage. Why continue with this? Very unnerving. However, I did as this had to straighten out..hopefully. And it did, kinda.Why indeed. The second part above is from a novel Susan (Amy Adams) receives from her ex-husband Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal). As she reads, we see the book hero Tony Hastings (also Jake Gyllenhaal) take his family on a vacation by car and three tough looking men drive him off the road and his wife and daughter are taken. These scenes are truly uncomfortable. There were 2-stories in here. Seeing Susan reading and looking back over her life doesn't count for too much as there is nothing there except she has regrets. The real story has Edward taking revenge on his ex-wife, who also aborted their baby, and she had constantly criticized his writing ability and eventually she gets it as she understands she is the wife in the novel and is killed along with her daughter. The main thrust we see is Tony getting help from Deputy Sheriff Bobby (Michael Shannon) by tracking down the 3-tough looking men and this takes up most of the movie as Susan reads the novel. Was this Edward's way of letting Susan know he would have done anything for her if given the chance? HmmmmmNotables; Andrea Riseborough as Alessia a woman Susan meets in a hotel lobby; Michael Sheen as Carlos, Alessia's gay husband; Laura Linney as Anne Sutton, Susan's mother; and Armie Hammer as Hutton Morrow, Susan's current and cheating husband. The acting is good all around, but, what was the point of all this? It was a long way to go to show simple Revenge. Susan finally realizes she has made many mistakes as she sits and waits for Edward, who wanted to meet again. She is still waiting. (5/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, those obese naked women. Language: Yes."
" Nature is unjust
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,6,"If you are young, rich, run a successful world-class fashion brand with your name and in your spare time can produce such a convincing drama, then one can only wonder what is left for the rest of us. Yet I have rated low the movie because of its violence and gore touch, but I am ready to give a higher mark when Tom Ford decides to give up on his chase of handsome-looking wannabe actors and focus on telling stories the way he knows. With no artifacts or thick frame eyeglasses. By the way, memorable Michael Shannon on his detective role."
" Best movie I have watched in 2017
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,9,"I would like to share my thoughts about this movie. I did not read anything before I watched, so my expectations were not so high. I just expected an average thriller-drama story, but the movie ending was simply amazing. The best movie ending I watched lately. Very emotional and dramatic. I am a big movie fan, but sometimes a movie, surprise me, as this one. It is the perfect ending for a really nice acting story line. Also, well executed script and superb cast. Love it, or not. I love it."
" Beginning, middle and end
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,8,"(Spoilers ahead) A beginning, middle and end, that's what a story needs right? Some people hated the movie because they thought the ending was too abrupt, however, all the tools to make the movie have a beginning, middle and good ending are there. You just have to find them to give meaning to the movie. Ford took his audience seriously. Using imagery instead of exposition he puts the movie stylishly together. It's a revenge story: Edward wants revenge on Susan for leaving him and killing their unborn child. Ford sets this up using the painting titled ""Revenge"". We go into a flashback where Susan tells Edward to stop writing about himself. This gives us an idea that Tony, the character in the book, is based on Edward himself. He too lost a wife (Susan) and a daughter (unborn child). Tony takes revenge and dies by accidentally killing himself. The movie ends with Edward not showing up in the restaurant. Did he kill himself his revenge now complete?I understand the film doesn't give all the answers so you have to formulate your own. The book was written for Susan because only she would get the message. The text from Edward asking her to meet up with him was his perfect set-up knowing she would long for him once again. His revenge perfect when he didn't show up. Susan was already haunted by her past life and she will never get the satisfaction of forgiveness."
" Interesting metaphorically based story
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,8,"Nocturnal Animals (2016), based on the novel of the same name, is a very fascinating story. It's one of deep rooted pain and regret by it's main character. The cast does a wonderful job at portraying their characters with realness and not holding back at all. Amy Adams gives a very melancholy performance, since her character is so damaged and woefully unhappy with the current state of her life. Jake Gylanhaal, who plays two very different characters in the film does a great job at nailing both of them and mastering their different personalities, how they behave, talk, and what they're all about. I really do praise Gylanhaal's performance here and I personally believe that he should have received an academy award nomination for this, he goes from being easy going and calm to very unhinged and almost out of his mind, given the circumstances he's in later in the movie. Michael Shannon did a very good job at playing this unorthodox police man, and I commend his performance, but I think that Gylanhaal outshines everyone in this movie as far as acting goes. The writing and dialogue in the film is riveting and very interesting, it reveals a lot about the individual characters. I really like the way the film was set up and how the metaphor set up by the novel affected Susan, the filmmakers handled that aspect very well. The ending was done well too, leaves you contemplating the whole movie and what happened and ultimately how it affected the main characters. 8/10. Oh and if nudity freaks you out, then watch out for the first 3 minutes."
" compelling and stylish thriller-drama
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,7,"Ford showcased his ambition in this gripping neo-noir thriller, plus its brilliant actors, Nocturnal Animals has its own animalistic nature in terms of being a compelling and stylish thriller-drama.We all know that Amy Adams is the star of the film and she's definitely sexy and gorgeous and somehow slayed every outfit, but Aaron Taylor-Johnson definitely carried his character well, we know he can be badass in Kick-Ass (2010 / 2013) but he can also be a total bad guy, let's just forget about his Quicksilver role in Avengers: Age Of Ultron (2015), c'mon where do you see a speedster getting hit by a bullet?Director Tom Ford is also a fashion designer, and that aspect of his life is very apparent in his film, the zealouslyness when it comes to beauty and style, where he uses his actors as his living mannequins with taste.But it doesn't just end there, as the outer features only served as a basis for the story, y'see that the idea of materialism is what its primary character has been living into. Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) affection to beauty is what destroys her loyalty and love by choosing a different path following her materialistic desires.Susan's current marriage is beginning to crumble with her cheating husband Hutton Morrow (Armie Hammer), she then received a unpublished novel from her ex-husband Edward Shefield (Jake Gyllenhaal) with an invitation for dinner, Susan envision the book as another reality where she and Edward are the protagonists, however, as the story goes dark she then remembered her life with Edward until she decided to end their relationship in exchange for a different life, and when she went to the agreed dinner to meet her ex and for a possible reconciliation, this is where her biggest realization occurred.Nocturnal Animals is a sharp, well-acted, beautifully written thriller drama which makes the lesson of loyalty a high-end cut."
" Tom Ford crafts a smart and gripping psychological drama that leaves you thinking for days.
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,9,"Nocturnal Animals is not a movie for everybody, as it has themes of murder, revenge, rape and the personal fears everybody has yet they refuse to confront. Nocturnal Animals is a psychological drama disguised as a violent revenge thriller, yet it still has those aspects in it. All the performances are amazing, with there being not a single weak actor in the film. The directing is incredible in a way that can capture raw emotion with hidden details such as visual cues and the fact that the scenes that are supposed to take place in the story within a story felt as if they were stolen from another film entirely and connected together so seamlessly in a way that showcases immense flexibility from Tom Ford in the skills of directing. It's layered, complex and really messed up, Aaron Taylor Johnson came out with a performance that got under my skin at parts. This is not a perfect movie, as I could count two or three visual cues that felt slightly on the nose and the scene with the Baby monitor was a directing choice I didn't really agree with. Other than those minute complaints, Nocturnal Animals is a fantastic movie by a fantastic director, although it isn't for everybody is still is a movie I would recommend to those who would want to see it. Overall I give it a 9 out of 10."

" Nocturnal Animals Review
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,9,"Nocturnal Animals is Tom Ford's second and most recent film. It is based on Austin Wright's ""Tony and Susan"" book. The film has in its cast Amy Adams, making the role of Susan Morrow; Jake Gyleenhaal, playing two characters Tony Hastings and Edward Sheffield, Susan's ex-husband; Michael Shannon is Lieutenant Bobby Andes and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ray Marcus.The film focuses on Susan Morrow, a wealthy art gallery owner, although she has a wealth of material possessions and a privileged social status, she has a sad and bitter life. Upon receiving a manuscript from a book written by her ex-husband, she begins to think about her past and the choices that made her get where she is today. Nocturnal Animals has three narratives, Susan's life in the present, the book's history, plus the flashbacks of her past. The connection between the stories is very subtle and quite interpretive.The narratives have quite different tones, while the story of the book is visceral and violent; Susan's life is opaque and lonely. The film, from the opening to the final sequence, is quite metaphorical. Even with all its symbolism, different stories, much due to the Tom Ford's work in the direction and in the script, the film manages to maintain a good pacing and tell an engaging story that makes the tension only increase over time. The director also prints his style in the use of the cameras producing in certain scenes a symmetrical aestheticism and having a distinct color palette for each narrative.Amy Adams has a strong performance, her character wants to convey the image of a strong and imposing figure, she does this with makeup. However, as she reads the book, we see how it affects her life, making her vulnerable. As she reads the story, her armor is gradually breaking. Jake Gyleenhaal has a great performance, in the character of ex-husband, Edward Sheffield, does not have many scenes, but as Tony Hastings, character of the book, he stands out.Michael Shannon plays a complex character and who is also going through a tragic and difficult moment in his life. His acting is unbelievable, he plays a rude character, but in certain moments also has to lower the guard, making himself vulnerable. The recognition of his work came with his Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor in 2017. Who most surprised me was Aaron Taylor- Johnson playing Ray Marcus. The actor is unrecognizable and his acting was so good and convincing, that you feel repulsion when the character is on the scene."
" I've never been more disgusted with my decision to watch a movie.
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,1,"This movie was visceral and evocative and completely vindictive and inane at the same time. They used all that money they spent, just to make the effing god awful scenes that they force you through all the more real and gut wrenching. If you are masochistic, you may~ like this. Otherwise, stay away. I'm an easygoing guy. I like almost every movie I watch. This is literally the first time I've ever felt about a movie: ""I will never get these two hours back."" Honestly, when you leave a movie and you feel sick to your stomach and it's not from eating too much popcorn: 1/10"
" Prentious? Moi??
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,4,"I like a good thriller or thinker movie, but I'm writing this to tell you - I was bored It's a balancing act to combine stylised noir with a road killer thriller and unfortunately this falls short This film feels like it could have been great, nothing to fault in the plot, or actors and the cinematography is beautiful - but it's really not complicated but dresses itself to look complicated. anyway, plus: It's existentialism gone mad ;-) Beautifully shot acting is top drawer interesting plot, complicatedminuses: It's existentialism gone mad ;-) boring plot, not complicated It's very easy to predict after watching Adaptation, Lost Highway this feels inferiorI don't know who this film is aimed at but if it's my demographic (middle-class, educated, 44 yrs) it seems a transparent attempt at 'cool' - and to be honest this film really dragsI don't have any inclination to think about this film anymore, I'm done.Shame as it could have been better"
" Meaninglessness dressed up as profundity.
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,1,"Exactly like his first film, this promises to deliver something which it is ultimately incapable of doing, instead being predictable and bereft of any depth. The story within a story is the thing that saves the film from being utter claptrap, and Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon also help prevent it from becoming total BS, but only just. The ""real world"" scenes are filled with the kind of pretentious arseholes which most of us thankfully never have to associate with, yet without a jot of irony or humour. In fact, every second of this film is as po-faced as it gets, and the ultra-serious tone makes us think something big is coming; something profound. Instead, it just ends, and it feels like he's attempting to do a Haneke trick, like we're supposed to have some realisation in the absence of denouement. But no, it's just meaningless ballsacks."
" Two means to a theme
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,7,"Excellent acting from Jake G and not a bad piece of work from anyone else is not quite enough to have this tale - with whatever intended conclusive meaning - a merging of time-lines and intention to get revenge or imagined revenge, a suspenseful study of the problems in our characters' lives, lead us to a clear idea of what we are really being told.This is a well-constructed piece of work and it's good to view, but it is solid only in the way a bridge providing no visible connection between divided land or levels, leaves me with the question ""why was the bridge there? why build it?"" We are immersed in a contemporary psychological drama, a problematic relationship which looks like it has been losing momentum for a long time, alternated with a ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" meets ""Psycho"" via Spielberg's all-time standard-setter ""Duel"" story - really, a story - of connected but time-distanced events. This is clever but omits the real intelligence of a summary, a final explanation.Try to put it all together, and any conclusion as to what story we've just been told is speculative intellectual guesswork.That....is not enough.In fact, looking at what I have just written may just be as inconclusive as ""Nocturnal Animals""."
" Style without (actual) substance
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,5,"This high style but uncomfortable emotional drama, despite the best efforts of the players, never quite justifies the price of admission: the first three minutes of the film. Tom Ford explained his controversial decision to include an opening sequence featuring completely nude morbidly obese women dancing in slow motion as a way to ""cast a spell"" upon viewers and get them interested in the story. (Vulture/09/2016) Well...the ""cast a spell"" part certainly worked on this viewer, who spent the remainder of the film distracted by fear of a return of Ford's ""valkyries."" I'm unfamiliar with Ford's career as a fashion designer, but I will definitely think twice before screening anything else with his name on it, irregardless of who is doing the acting. Critics, for the most part, loved this movie. So did just about everybody else. I found it lacked substance, that is, after the first three minutes, and became bored trying to keep the different threads in perspective. I did like the ending of the reality sequence, however. But other than that, only the skills of Adams, Gyllenhaal and Shannon make it recommendable. Especially Shannon, who never disappoints. This could have been a good film in the hands of another, less self-indulgent, filmmaker."
" Better than expected
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,9,I liked this movie much more than I expected. Some comments state there is no point to this movie or it is a movie about nothing. I felt it was absolutely about Jake Gyllenhaal's statement that if you find true love you need to take care of it because you may never get it again. The movie was beautifully stylized and well acted. It also convinced me never to drive through west Texas without a concealed carry permit and a loaded firearm and having taken shooting lessons!
" A disappointment
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,1,"A waste of time. Artsy-fartsy. A very predictable tasteless product.A woman caught in the absurdity of her life gets reminded of a previous life..well, that's about it..No clue how this would earn a reward. I can think of several catchphrases for this sort of film,the intro of it was deceptive!! No more shockers after that. I am disappointed."
" Don't waste your emotions
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,1,This film is mostly based on the graphic abduction of a mother and daughter infront of the husband.Actors were AWESOMEStory lines was week leaving too many unanswered questions and a plot that was pathetic
" Best to be avoided
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,1,"Encouraged by a relatively positive ranking I made a mistake of watching this questionable achievement in cinematography. It is pointless, quite boring and clearly, yet another example of a notion that ugly toiled scenes are some sort of an 'art'. Luckily, I watched it online so it was cheap, literally."
" Outstandingly Performed and Absolutely Haunting...with some Pacing Issues
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,9,"Nocturnal Animals follows a woman who, after receiving a manuscript of a novel written by her ex-husband, begins to read it and draws connections from the story to her own life. The performances are all outstanding in this movie. Jake Gyllenhaal is amazing, further proving to the world why he's one of the best actors in the business, and begging the question of why he hasn't won an Oscar yet. Michael Shannon is great as well, pulling a both very serious and somewhat frightening role, while also adding a hint of comedy. While his character is something of a cliché, he has enough depth to him to make him believable and interesting. And somehow, through that he snags a lot of dark comedy out of it. But if you were to ask me, the best performance here is Aaron Taylor- Johnson. I've never seen him like this before, he fully gives himself to this performance. He's haunting, and makes for some of the best, and most disturbing, scenes in this movie. Even when he acts completely insane, he seems to believe it. His character absolutely believes, lives even, every single line of dialogue. Every single move he makes is just perfect. Each of these actors steal every scene their in, and they often share scenes. It's great. With actors like these, the movie proves hard to watch on multiple occasions, and it creates genuine feelings of dread or anger on the part of the audience. When a movie manages to get the audience that invested, you know it's done something right. The writing is great. The way the story moves and progresses is both realistic and engaging. The movie knows that the portions from the manuscript itself are more interesting than the parts with the ex- wife, and as such most of the movie is consumed by the manuscript. The symbolic imagery is really good too. It used images or scenes to connect other scenes or situations, then continues to build on the connection and symbolism through that. And it's not like it's convoluted or hard to figure out, it's rather simple actually, and yet it's very clever. Amy Adams stars in this movie, more as a supporting character, and she was sort of off and on. Considering how few her scenes were, it was somewhat hard to develop her character, and by the end the audience really hadn't learned much about who she was and she really wasn't given the chance to blow any of us away. This isn't a bad performance by her, it's pretty average by her standards actually. If you were to ask me what her best 2016 performance was I would absolutely say it was 'Arrival', but for what her role was, she did a good job here too. Despite the horror and intrigue presented by this film, it does tend the drag from time to time. While the out-of-manuscript moments are necessary to make the movie deeper, they're also a lot slower and an unappreciated break from a thrilling story. This is where it gets kind of confusing for me, because if the movie didn't have these out-of-manuscript moments it wouldn't be as layered, whereas if it keeps these moments the pacing suffers. It really comes down to which I'd prefer, and I think I'd rather yawn a couple times than lose depth. Overall Nocturnal Animals is fantastic. The acting, the writing, the plot, the layers, and even the comedy are all outstanding. It suffers from pacing, but it's a worthy sacrifice. In the end I would highly recommend this movie and I can't wait to see it again."
" OK film
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,7,"This is a decent film-kind of dragged down by its slow pace and dreary atmosphere. Amy Adams plays a wealthy art dealer who has recently remarried and receives a manuscript from her aspiring writer of an ex-husband who sends it to her to prove to her that he really can put a manuscript together. The movie turns into a story-within-a-story as she reads the manuscript, and it shifts between her life and the manuscript's plot.The second husband turns out to be a bit of a jerk, and the story about her life focuses on the flashbacks with her first husband, her art gallery, and her current life. The manuscript is about a family run off the road by a bunch rednecks who then abduct the wife and daughter and make life hell for the husband, who wants revenge. Jake Gylenhaal is good in the dual role as the ex-husband and the main character in the story. Amy Adams is also good in her part.You might like this movie if you like the main actors. It does have a good cast and decent story.** 1/2 out of ****"
" Excellent Thought Provoking Movie
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,9,"After watching the movie, first thing came to my mind, why was this movie not nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best adaptive screenplay category. The movie was mind-grappling within first 15 minutes and then never a boring till the end. And the ending was one of the bests of recent past.Let me say the premises of the movie. An ex-husband writes a novel and lets his ex-wife read that. The novel was a totally fictional one, but as we progress on, we can understand the inspiration behind the novel. As a viewer, you can link different characters of the novel with writer and his wife's real life. The novel itself was good, and the impact the wife feels during reading this novel is fun to watch. I really enjoyed this movie. Jake Gyllenhall was amazing, so was Michael Shannon as a supporting actor. The direction was good, dialogues were deep and witty, the acting of other supporting actors was good too. Highly recommended."

" Strangers in the night
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,9,"This film has sequences about as dark as they come, mainly because they seem so real.The story develops on two levels. When Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) is sent a manuscript of a book by her ex-husband, Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal), the story within the manuscript plays out on the screen - it is harrowing cinema.Jake Gyllenhaal now plays Tony Hastings who is taking his family on a trip in West Texas when they are involved in a road rage incident. Although we sense that the story is meant to have relevance to the former marriage of Edward and Susan, Tony Hasting's wife and daughter are played by different actors: Isla Fisher and Ellie Bamber. The whole sequence is a car driver's worst nightmare as Jake, his wife and their daughter are overwhelmed by a terrible situation.The story cuts back and forth between the real world and the story in the manuscript. But like Susan as she compulsively reads the story, I was anxious for the film to return to Edward's manuscript; it has an intensity I don't think I have felt since watching ""Se7en"" 20-years ago. Jake's guilt at his unpreparedness and inability to protect his family is the cold shiver that runs through the story even as other developments send it in an unexpected direction.Jake Gyllenhaall doesn't star in dud movies and I knew this would be good. Director Tom Ford has wrung a lot out of every scene including an off-the-wall opening sequence featuring naked, super plus-sized ladies; the beginning is a warning that this will not be an ordinary journey.The film has a beautifully nuanced, mainly orchestral score by Abel Korzenoiski whose work has a similar classiness to Alexandre Desplat's. No nomination for an Academy Award though - an oversight.Although the story in the manuscript is revenge on Amy Adams' character, I was so overwhelmed by the story within the story that I don't think I made the connection immediately, however, it's a film that not only leaves you reeling; it also leaves you thinking."
" Really enjoyed it
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,7,"I just finished watching Nocturnal Animals and I loved it. I loved the tension in the movie, the plot and the ending. Frist, the opening credits for me, are very cool, but Amy Adams later refers to them as ""junk art."" The first 40-50 minutes were absolutely amazing and Jake Gyllenhaal is so good in is personage. The highway scene was so unnerving for me, really stressing. The real story line in the movie was necessary for the history of the book, and Amy Adams, was very good in showing the tension of her memories with Edward. I think in the end this movie was about weakness and loss. A very good thriller."
" Brilliant
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,9,"If anyone has seen Tom Fords directorial debut, 'A Single Man', then you'll know its beautifully filmed, I enjoyed it a lot for this but I know that some of my friends who weren't as in to the aesthetics found it to be a bit like a 'long perfume advert'. However in Nocturnal Animals Ford still creates a visually stunning film but with a very character driven story and a lot more dialogue. For me it felt like a very complete film. Ford was able to move through the characters Past, Present and the Non-fictional story (written by Gyllenhaals character Edward) through clever filming and cinematography.(+score in my opinion was beautiful) The ending, in my opinion, was killer. Endings often ruin films for me, and I can safely say that this one definitely did not. Would definitely recommend this film- Ford seems to be going from strength to strength in his film making."
" form over substance
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,4,"Don't watch it! It is not as graphic as Irréversible but as evil and pointless. It is well shot, well acted, it has a great rhythm but this movie will just sh*t in your soul with no up side for the sadness and disgust. Why do they make movies like that? I guess some just have fun by raping other peoples bodies and souls. Tom Ford and Austin Wright need a psychiatric help. That is one thought you will get after wasting 2 hours of your time on this ..."
" There's a fine line between Justice & Revenge..
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"'Nocturnal Animals' is a tale within a tale by writer/director Tom Ford. Some may think this film is absurd and maybe a bit unorthodox, but what happens when you begin to look beyond the surface?1. To start, I must warn audience that the opening credits of this film is utterly atrocious. Please don't consider this as a spoiler rather than a reason to skip 3mins ahead. The opening sequence depicts obese women dancing in a transitional slideshow as part of an art display. I for one almost switched off the TV by that alone, but I'm glad I stuck with it cause there's a rather exceptional film to be seen once you get past the opening. So aside from that, this is a surprisingly good film. People may get bored since there is a slow pace throughout, but the gripping nature of the sheer thriller that plays out is worth the watch.2. The plot is rather intricate as we early on find the film's central figure Susan (Amy Adams), receive a letter from her ex- husband Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal), which contains a draft of his first book. As she begins reading, the book's story plays out as nearly a separate film as it's premise depicts a man who's wife and child are kidnapped along a deserted Texan highway. Amy Adams may be the main figure who the audience follows, but Jake Gyllenhaal delivers one of the best performances of his career in this dual role. Since his story on both sides deals with loss, Gyllenhall emotes the most as we watch his character have mental and emotional breakdowns.3. Someone who deserves an equal amount of praise for his performance is Michael Shannon, who plays Detective Andes, that undertakes Jake Gyllenhaal's case with a passion in the book. His determination and sheer focus on finding the bad guys makes him a force to be reckoned with. As far as the book's premise goes, Aaron Taylor-Johnson portrays the antagonist to a despicable point and you can't help but hate him as the story plays out more and more. The film as a whole has an underlying theme of both regret and revenge, which comes to focus the more it progresses. Once again, it (for the most part) keeps you engaged.4. As far as flaws go, there are other interesting side characters introduced throughout, but there is little to no development to them. Armie Hammer, Michael Sheen and Laura Linney all make appearances, but they have less than or up to 5mins of screen time. The most blatant thing for people who watch this movie, is gonna be the ending. I was a bit lost by the time the ending came, but only after some web research was I able to fully understand it. This can be a problem for some. The story of the book comes full-circle, but it's obvious there are things in the real world that are left unrealized or without a proper conclusion. Hats off to Tom Ford because this was easily one of my favorite films of 2016. This deserves to be seen, not only for it's superb style and editing, but for the outstanding stories and performances which propel this movie close to being great."
" A film that conquers your thoughts and refuses to leave your mind !!!
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,10,"Fashion Designer Tom Ford ventured into the field of filmmaking with his debut film 'A Single Man' in 2009. 'A Single Man' was a well made, solid debut film which gave enough hints regarding Tom Ford's eye for cinematic storytelling and frame composition. But with his second film 'Nocturnal Animals', Ford has made it clear that he is one of the greatest artistic minds working in cinema today. This is a film of immense maturity, depth and intricacy. The script of 'Nocturnal Animals' written by Ford himself(based on the novel 'Tony and Susan' by Austin Wright) balances three separate narratives. Two of them in the 'real' world from two different timelines and the third being the narrative of the novel written by Edward. But the one overriding element is that all these narratives are being laid out in front of us from Susan's perspective. With the separate narratives appearing interspersed between each other, we slowly start seeing intricate elements and commonalities slipping from one narrative to the other which could be some literal object like a red sofa or it could a thematic similarity between characters. It sounds really complicated, but Ford succeeds in pulling it off with the utmost elegance without compromising with the thematic complexities.As Susan reads Edward's novel, she mentally starts finding some connections between some of the fictional violence in the novel and some events that occurred in their married life. This forces her to slip into a state of contemplation and self-reflection. There are two ways to look at this aspect of the film. First way is to accept that Edward's novel is genuinely connected to Susan and Edward's past life. With this interpretation, the theme that gets into focus is roots of or the motivations behind the art created by the artist. This shows that the fictional physical violence that appears in a work of art like a novel or a film might have its roots in immense depression or emotional pain suffered by the artist in his/her real life. This film shows that if you truly know the artist in real life, you can make connections between the fictional violence and the real violence no matter how deceptively camouflaged it may be. The second way to look at the film will be to believe that the connections between the novel appear in front of us mainly because the dramatisation of the novel is taking place from Susan's POV. She is bringing her own sensibilities and life experiences to the novel and interpreting it to mean something. We very commonly hear the phrase - 'this novel changed my life', 'or this film changed my life' - 'Nocturnal Animals' shows how the subjectivity of interpretation of a work of art can add a whole new dimension to a seemingly unrelated or unfamiliar artwork. Not only that, sometimes something like a painting which spoke to you in one way, might speak to you in a completely different way a few years later. Tom Ford also infuses the concept of how societal norms, customs and conventional expectations can shape the definitions of happiness, masculinity and marriage. Just like 'A Single Man', one can easily see Hitchcock's influence (especially 'Vertigo') on Tom Ford in the way he uses colour. The colour palette of the film with the intricate use of the blue and red hue on screen is used beautifully by Ford not just to separate the different narratives but also to express themes. I was also reminded of other directors like David Lynch because of the dream- like fluidity between the real and the fictional, the Coen brothers due to the gritty neo-western feel of the section with the novel narrative and also Kubrick, because of the meticulousness of the frame compositions. The film is also edited brilliantly with frequent transitions and shifts from one narrative to the next, sometimes on visual cue but with no element of confusion.The acting is brilliant from everyone involved. Michael Shannon is great as the no-nonsense world weary cop, Aaron Taylor-Johnson is almost unrecognisable and is really menacing. Jake Gyllenhaal is good too and Amy Adams' character gives the film some heart as she is the one who actually has an arc, an emotional one. 'Nocturnal Animals' is one of those films that will continue to linger in your thoughts for days due to its narrative and thematic complexities. It shows that Tom Ford is a creative powerhouse whose subsequent works I just can't wait for. Highly Recommended."
" A distraught character drama that kept me on the edge of my seat
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,8,"Nocturnal Animals starts out with a blinding display of full nudity and dives into the distraught character played by Amy Adams. She reads a book about a story involving Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon characters that kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire film. The bad guys are the worst and I hope I never wind up on a long, dark West Texas road with them especially Aaron Taylor-Johnson (nomination). I recommend not watching this alone. It was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, Director and Screenplay."
" How weak you really are?
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,8,"Not typical happy end American movie. Feels more like European but with better camera and styling. For the story however, it may annoy a lot of people. Cowardice and insecurity in others is enraging. Do they deserve redemption? Probably of this type at the best? For me it was very involving, but how many people have actually been tested this way? Ho many were able to challenge they own fear in our time of liberal dictatorship and decline in normal popular Masculinity? And how many have real compassion and integrity?Thought provoking and morally challenging film."
" I used to be a big fan of Michael Shannon
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,2,"This looks like a movie I'd really like but unfortunately I won't be seeing it. I used to be a big fan of Michael Shannon, I was right up to the time he announced that he wanted to kill every single Trump voter out there. And since I voted for Trump, that includes me. How on earth can I pay good money to see a movie where one of the main actors wants me dead ?"
" Gap Between Novel and Film?
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,6,"I haven't even read ""Tony and Susan,"" the novel upon which Nocturnal Animals is based, but I suspect if I had I'd be saying the novel is much better. This is due to the disjointed feeling this film had, and not only because there were two parallel stories being told, but because it felt as if stuff was left out. Maybe because the ending was so ambiguous? I was left feeling especially confused after Tony/Edward killed the man who had killed and raped his wife and daughter, and he lay outside in the desert, bloody and blinded. It looked to me as if he were dead at that point. Yet then there was that email and that he was supposedly going to meet Susan for dinner, though, of course didn't show up.As another review said, the film seemed like it was intended to say something deep or profound but, ultimately, didn't really say anything. I agree with this, although one ""message"" that did come across was if you are a writer and your material is based on your life's experiences, then even if you have horrific things happen to you, this is a good thing as it helps you to produce fascinating stories. I had that experience while watching, i.e., the most engrossing part of the film was when Tony/Edward was going through his ordeal, yet horrible things happened that one wouldn't wish on anyone. For the film/novel material, however, hey, it made for gripping watching/reading."
" Pleasant surprise!
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,9,"This movie was such a pleasant surprise. It was riddled with beauty and sorrow and I was just hypnotised throughout it.We are presented to Susan Morrow in such a subtle manner. We get a glimpse of her current life and then the action is interspersed with bits of her past as well as scene's from her ex-husband Edward's novel. Everything is just so smooth. You are presented with just enough to understand the dynamics in her life and what she and Edward have felt. Every scene is precious and engaging and I did not want the movie to end but at the same time I did because the tension was just so rich.Some images are quite shocking, starting with the opening one. The soundtrack is quite enthralling and, much like the narrative, it wraps up nicely towards the end. The sobriety of Amy Adams' character's look, as well as her surroundings, as well as other very clever scenes add to the dark atmosphere but not in a in-your-face sort of way. The film is just so well made. Everything comes together to produce an entrancing work of art. It is an intense and powerful movie with little clues scattered throughout that will make most sense towards the end but that you can definitely take with you and mull over.There were a couple of cheesy lines both in the 'real world' and the novel one but overall I am blown away by this movie and so glad I managed to watch it. The ending caught me off guard but once I digested it I saw it made sense.And the performances. Amy Adams stunned me and Jake Gyllenhaal was amazing as always but I absolutely have to mention Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. My goodness, they were stunning in their role. Pretty much everyone was superb, but these guys shone extra bright and I hope Shannon wins the Oscar. I will also definitely be looking out for more movies by Tom Ford.I hope you watch it. Nocturnal Animals will hopefully stir your emotions, as it did with me."
" No emotional build-up whatsoever
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,4,"I've seen worse, and this is the only reason why this film gets a 4. But seriously - it is very pretentious and it doesn't live up to whatever artsy intentions it set for itself. It's just a bunch of clichés wrapped in a visually appealing - ma non troppo - form. What bothered me most is the artificial build-up of suspense when Susan suddenly gasps and loses breath while reading the novel. She isn't reading any Stephen King, nor is she reaching some highly intense points where the novel twists and turns. No, she is just reading some sort of a western story that's emotionally very dry. There is no real connection with any of the characters in the two parallel stories, at the end I really couldn't care less if they all lived or died in pain. No emotional build-up whatsoever. And the metaphor of his revenge is simply cheap."
" 100% pure Junk
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,1,"This film should be mandatory watching for why you should carry a GUN!!! OH , OK liberals don't freak out!!!! I'm not going to bore you with big fifty cent BS words because I'm not trying to out do others in here writing a review of this movie. people who get on here and try to empress others with their words. ""This is a gorgeous film to look at as well, Seamus McGarvey's cinematography echoing the story's bleakness and the brutality of Edward's supposed veiled threat to Susan. The combination of the visuals with Abel Korzeniowski's dream-like score heightens the sense of escapism felt by Susan as she reads Edward's novel."" OMG give me a break."" Did someone really write that? LMAO. Really, "" dream-like score heightens the sense of escapism felt by Susan as she reads Edward's novel."" But onward. Once again someone hired this idiot Michael Shannon who is a worthless piece of dog crap liberal capital A Hole. They moron can't act and once again it shows in this movie. We can cross our fingers and hope he blows away and never seen on the screen again.This is a very slow, slow, slow, did I mention slow movie. It goes back and forth between the now, and the past. Susan's (Amy Adams ) was married to pretty much a liberal, Edward, ( Jake Gyellenhaal ) hehe, well, OK a wuss , who couldn't protect his wife and daughter when they encounter some roughens on a dark highway late at night. Of course he has no gun and all kinds of thing happen to the her and her daughter. Let me just cut to the chase, BORNING!!!!! You could and will fall asleep watching this, and when you wake up, you have not missed a thing. The director just loses everyone with the way he tried to piece this crap together. The ending, well, it will be the two hours lost in your life watching this pure 100% junk."
" 'When you love someone you have to be careful with it, you might never get it again.'
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,10,"Austin Wright chilling novel TONY AND SUSAN has been transformed into a film renamed NOCTURNAL ANIMALS by screenwriter/fashion designer/director Tom Ford whose other film A SINGLE MAN was equally extraordinary. The visual, delusional, fantasy embracing, and raw brutality of this film is complemented by very fine performances by some our finest actors of the time – even minute roles are managed by such luminaries as Laura Linney, Michael Sheen, Armie Hammer, Andrea Riseborough, Zawe Ashton, Jena Malone, Isla Fisher, Karl Glusman among others.The film opens silently at first with the screen filled with a morbidly obese completely nude female and gradually other equally (an even more) obese women are seen moving to music and eventually lying on platforms like artwork: the effect is startling but provide a solid overture to what we are about to experience. In short, a wealthy art gallery owner (Amy Adams, in a role that is most Oscar worthy) is haunted by her ex-husband's novel (Jake Gyllenhaal), a violent thriller dedicated to her which she interprets as a symbolic revenge tale about her failed marriage. With more detail, this is a story within a story in which the first part follows a woman named Susan who receives a book manuscript from her ex-husband Edward, a man whom she left 20 years earlier, asking for her opinion. The second element follows the actual manuscript, called ""Nocturnal Animals,"" which revolves around a man whose family vacation turns violent and deadly. It also continues to follow the story of Susan, who finds herself recalling her first marriage and confronting some dark truths about herself. As Susan reads the unpublished novel (her current husband – Armie Hammer – is away on yet another trip) the novel comes to life as we watch Tony Hastings (Jake Gyllenhaal) loose his wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and daughter (Ellie Bamber) to the brutality of a trio of wild men – Ray (Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Lou (Karl Glusman) and Turk (Robert Aramayo): wife and daughter are sexually abused and killed. Tony finds help with the local cancer ridden sheriff Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon) and together they enact revenge. All of this is happening as Susan identifies with Laura, extrapolating the story as a version of her own life as an unfulfilled artist, meeting the-ex-husband Edward (Gyllenhaal) who is visiting new York to see Susan's response to his long awaited first novel.There is so much more to this film than that brief synopsis, but the core response is the brilliance of actors Adams, Gyllenhaal, Shannon, and Taylor-Johnson. Why the Oscars passed over this stunning film is a question whose answer we will never know. Brilliant!"
" Nocturnal Animals is a story about this family man who is useless, and bad guys destroy his life because they are evil.
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,1,"Nocturnal Animals is your typical revenge tale where innocent loser gets rekt by people whose favorite past time is being evil stereotypes. Then sudden personality change and sweet, sweet revenge. Or not.Typically movie of this sort would be 5/10 and well worth the watching despite the mediocrities. Nocturnal Animals does manage to do few things in such advanced awfulness, that it becomes close to unwatchable.1) Jake Gyllenhaal's character is so boring, blatant and useless that there is no reasonable explanation to care about what happens to him or his family. I found the generic bad guys to be more relatable than this personality lacking loser of a man. And those guys didn't even have personalities either. 2) The editing. This is a story withing a story. In execution this is lot like a time skip which doesn't skip time - more familiarly knows as the Fairy Tail Trolling. It doesn't add anything to the story, but manages to annoy with its amateurish nature. +) The hype. This was supposed to be a good movie. 5/10 at least. It was bigger disappointment than average movie could have been. +) Amy Adams is called a main character and she is in the poster. In the movie, she just reads a book and wears makeup. Please, she was used as a marketing bait here."
" re-ven-ge
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,6,"This was simply awesome. I meant the story, but the presentation was not my kind. I got the story and I enjoyed it. The performances can't be neglected either. Both the lead, Jake and Amy were the film's highlight. But I also happy for Michale Shannon's Oscars nominee. Based on the novel 'Tony and Susan', but for the film adaptation, the title got inspired by the book that appear in the story. From the director of 'A Single Man' which is his comeback film after a long gap. I would say a good attempt.This is the story of a successful art gallery boss who got divorced and remarried to the man whom she was cheating with from her ex. Her decision was in particular influenced by her mother. Now she thinks she's happy, but one day her ex sends a copy of his latest novel that's dedicated in her name. Reading it, she realises the tough time he'd with their separation. Following the end of the book, she encounters an unexpected truth which could affect her life forever.A dual layer story. One was fiction and the other one in the real world. But the fictional tale highly influences the main narration and that's what I call the genuine writing. So the credit must go to none other than the original author. I have seen lots of revenge films, even it can be compared to 'Three Colours: White', but the major difference is the sweet revenge. For that alone the film was awesome. The climax was even better. If you understand the narration, you will enjoy it for sure. The filmmaking should have been a bit better. Excluding that the film is not to be skipped.6/10"
" Just walk away! No RUN!!!
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,4,"I don't understand how the hell this is rated so high! The crap that gets released these days is beyond me! I'm starting to really hate Hollywood.Chances are if you're reading this, you are already mad at Hollywood like myself. You've watched helplessly as it bastardized the franchises you loved as a child, or failed to promote or even release a project you had been excited about for years.You can write it all off as greed and the terrible taste of the movie-going public, but there are other factors that make Hollywood the soulless blockbuster machine that it is."
" Really well done. Haven't seen a movie this good in a long time.
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,8,"I have read many reviews of this movie and I believe they all entirely miss the mark. This movie isn't about revenge at all. It is about the nature of male/female relationships at this current time. The dancing figures at the beginning are majorette/fertility goddesses. They are all representations of the universal woman and the artist, Susan. ""All women turn into their mothers."" Susan appears sitting on a slab in a green dress, the current incarnation of the fertility goddess herself. The dancing/dead women are there to represent the life cycle: birth, death, rebirth. But the dancing goddesses/majorettes are depicted as old because the male/female relationship is played out and no longer fertile. The men in the story, every single one of them including the killers, are weak and lost without female boosterism and direction. The first husband, Edward, demonstrates that he at least realizes this because it is the theme of his novel. The murderer states that he only does what women accuse him of doing. The sheriff disappears after he kills the first murderer leaving ""weak"" husband Tony alone. And Tony, in true bungler fashion, ends up killing himself. They are all lost and incompetent.The sign ""revenge"" alludes to women taking their revenge on men, other women and themselves by assuming the typical male role in the boardroom and elsewhere in frustration over their disappointment in men. Note the sterility of the environment, the dominatrix female, and the all-female staff. In death, as in life, women (the mother and daughter in an eternal embrace, the women on the slabs) have only themselves to count on, to love. They are alone. The men in their lives have faded away due to their own idiocy, evilness, and weakness. That is why Amy sits alone, in yet another incarnation, in her green dress, reborn at the moment that her first husband died because she believed that his insight might mean that he had changed. His fictional death might be the acceptable sacrifice to the goddess. But just as every single other male character, even those alluded to, could not really connect with women or be relied upon, Edward remained the ever disappointing male. I could say a lot more about the movie's meaning but know it isn't about revenge. It's about the nature of men and women and their relationship. And Amy is an artist. It is her own performance art which is being depicted at the beginning. She is not just the curator at an art gallery. It's important to know."
" A film with ambition, but that fails to execute.
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,6,"The story of ""Night Animals"" has potential, with actors very well directed in their roles, the film has many elements that a great film needs, but its history does not convince much.Basically (without spoilers), we have the story ""divided"" into two narratives, with a ""staging"" of a book, which is read by the protagonist, and the story itself in the ""real world."" The premise itself is very good, but execution is not competent.It takes some time for the viewer to begin to understand the real purpose of the story of the book, and yet it continues to look largely unhelpful to the overall plot, though excellent if analyzed in isolation.With all of that, the fictional book story is still the coolest part of the movie, ignoring the connections to the real world, the story of revenge and hatred surrounds, and makes you want to see more of each scene.But the real world does not have that much appeal.In addition to these mistakes, the film tries in several moments to be more than it really is, abusing the references to itself, metalanguage, and etc, in a very pretentious way. An example of a super- unnecessary scene is the opening sequence, with super-nudity played, and that means NOTHING to the rest of the movie, it just seems to be there to say ""we're radical, we started our movie with a non-standard nudity.""But not everything is negative, worth the highlight for the work of actors in the film. Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, are very well and especially Jack Gyllenhaal and Aaron-Johnson Taylor, with excellent performances in their roles.In summary: Nocturnal Animals is not a bad movie, but fails to hit its line of thought, and at several moments thinks it is much more than it really is, which leaves production with an ""arrogance"" that somehow, You realize your faults more than your hits. Other than that, the film has very well written dialogues, one of its extremely immersive narrative nuclei, and a cast in excellent shape. Maybe it was worth seeing."
" Mesmerizing
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,9,"There have been few movies in which Jake Gyllenhaal has starred that I have not enjoyed immensely. ""Nocturnal Animals"" is no exception. Perfectly cast and directed, this is an actual assault on the senses. Much like the poem ""Lady or the Tiger"" (by Frank Stockton), the viewer will have to figure out this movie--and that will not be easy.The story is about a well-to-do artist, wonderfully played by Amy Adams, who receives a manuscript from her 20-year divorced husband entitled ""Nocturnal Animals."" He wants her opinion because she once told him he had no talent. What then takes place is a story within a story. That's all I will reveal about the plot.From it's opening--one which you will not forget anytime soon--to the ending, this is pure character-based entertainment. The ending left me speechless and wanting more.Rated ""R"" for graphic nudity, language, rape, and violence, this was one heck of a ride."
" A disturbing, provocative masterpiece that will stay in your mind
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,10,"The main title sequence of ""Nocturnal Animals"" of grotesquely obese naked women with credits superimposed upon them might find you chastising me for recommending this film. Stick it out. What follows is a visually ravishing and provocative triumph of visionary filmmaking that is one of the great films of 2016.Directed by Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent fashion designer Tom Ford (and adapted by Ford from Austin Wright's 1993 novel, Tony and Susan), this is a multi-layered 'story within a story' that will disturb viewers while cementing them to their seats. The main framing narrative follows a wealthy art gallery owner named Susan (Amy Adams at her least bubbly) whose second marriage is falling apart as apathy and depression consume her boring life. The actual story begins when she receives a book manuscript by her ex-husband (Jake Gyllenhaal) whom she had left 19 years earlier, a novel pinned with a note asking for her to provide feedback. As she reads, the film takes us directly into the novel itself which turns out to be a violent neo-noir thriller revolving around a man (also Gyllenhaal) whose vacation with his family has turned deadly and has driven him to hire a detective (played by Michael Shannon in arguably the finest performance of his career to date) as his world slips into inexorable nightmare. The film cleverly mixes the two narratives as Adams (along with the audience) attempts to piece together parallels between the fictional novel and her own life. In each of the two narratives director Ford exhibits a perfect merging of style with theme: Its framing story displays the polished visual opulence of the director's background in fashion design with a deliberately measured pacing in its editing; in contrast, the inner narrative embraces the sordid, grimy visual ugliness of an roughhewn pulp novel while employing a more forceful rhythm in the editing. The effect is as if a stately Bruckner symphonic movement were invaded by poly-tonal tone clusters from a Charles Ives piece.Director Ford has said, ""(a film) can be entertaining, but if you leave the theater and it doesn't stay with you, doesn't haunt you, doesn't challenge you, then it's not successful."" ""Nocturnal Animals"" succeeds by these standards beyond his wildest dreams. When I first saw it, I left the theater staggering as though hit by a brickbat. Since then it has stayed in my mind and continues to haunt me, even as I write this review now."
" An expertly controlled and very stylish film in Tom Ford's sophomore release
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,9,"In a quite unexpected second motion picture, Ford offers a very controlled film, mimicking the very characters it is portraying. From the Lynchian opening, to the suspenseful, incredibly crafted, almost Hitcockian, action scenes and the evocative colour palette, my eyes were glued to the screen. Shannon and Gyllenhaal are amazing, but Adams manages to instill in the audience a sense of restlessness which few could've pulled off. It's amazing how absolutely nothing feels out of place, as if Ford was looming behind every shot, every word and every gesture."
" Brilliant Movie, but lacks subtlety.
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,9,"Nocturnal Animals is one of those movies that divides opinions. Very few people will be neutral about it, most will either love it or hate it. Lets start the review by commenting on the direction: It was brilliant. I didn't know about this director but i think it is safe to say that this script could have been a disaster in the wrong hands. The art direction is very slick and haunting. At first, i thought i was watching a horror/thriller. The soundtrack is also great and it fits in like a glove.Technically speaking, we have a solid picture, i think even the critics would agree with that.The Plot: An art gallery owner receives a copy of a book written by her ex-husband. The book is dedicated to her. At the point when she receives the book, Susan seems to be having a mild existential crisis. As the movie progresses we see a parallel between the book and Susan's and Edward's past.In the book, a man named Tony is attacked on the road by a group of local criminals who end up killing his wife and child and leaving him in the desert. In real Life, Susan had broken up their marriage after feeling that their relationship lacked things she seemed to need. The movie emphasizes that Edward felt like Susan perceived their relationship as unsatisfactory, even though she loved him. Having never been able to get over their separation, and perceiving the end as a brutal experience, the book reflects Edward's perspective on the end of their marriage. The criminals in the book, The Nocturnal Animals, are a grotesque caricature of Susan, whom Edward used to call a Nocturnal Animal as well. Their reckless, ruthless and sadistic actions seemed to represent how Edward felt about the way how Susan dealt with the end of their relationship. His wife and daughter in the book seemed to represent their marriage, their love and their unborn child, whom Susan aborted shortly after meeting her current husband. In the novel, we also have two characters trying to enact justice; Tony and Detective Bobby. Both of these characters Seemed to represent Edward. While Tony seems emotional and passive, Bobby is brutal, cold and effective, almost like an alter-ego, someone Tony needs in order to achieve his revenge. At every step of the way Bobby seems to encourage and drive Tony towards his goal of having justice for his family. By doing this, Bobby prevents Tony from moving on with his life and letting go of the anger and sadness that plagues him. A Dying man, Bobby says many times that he has nothing to lose and that he doesn't care about the repercussion of his actions. At the end of the novel, Tony achieves his revenge but is hurt during a struggle and ends up accidentally shooting himself in the stomach, this causes him to die in the desert alone. In real life, Susan, who has had her love for Edward slightly re-kindled with constant memories of their past together, is invited by him for an amicable meeting in the form of a dinner on a tuesday night.In the final scene of the movie, real life seems to imitate fiction as Edward has his revenge on Susan by not showing up to their dinner reunion. Much like the character in his novel, real life Edward achieves his goals by not letting go of his hurt and possibly at the cost of true happiness.It is a movie about heart break and its themes are universal. Having praised the good parts, lets mention the biggest movie flaw: The character of Susan. Even with a masterful and subtle portrayal by actress Amy Adams, this is the only aspect in which the movie falls short. While you can clearly see the screenwriter or the author of the novel in Edward and all of his alter egos, there is also too much of him on Susan as well. The Character seems submissive, tame, and overly repentful for no reason at all. Even though she emphasizes how long she hasn't spoken to Edward for, Susan seems way more remorseful than she should be if we were talking about a real person. Many times she says she has done brutal, unexcusable things to her poor ex-husband and that he should never forgive her. Being a highly successful gallery owner she seems to question her life choices and everything she has done since breaking up with poor Edward, to the point where she seems almost guilty about her success because of her betrayal. The symbolism in this movie is very explicit, that is OK for the most part. The overly repentant approach to the character of Susan, however, gives light to the redemption fantasies of the author/screenwriter in a way that should have been invisible. This causes the character to behave in a very unrealistic/submissive way.This a big flaw for which im taking two points from my review. I have seen at least one review on this site in which the author called the movie mysoginistic and i have to say i understand where the author in question is coming from. For a movie that was executed in such a masterful way, with good acting and direction, this lack of subtlety is unexcusable. Overall i think Nocturnal Animals is definitely one of the best movies of 2016 and i highly recommend it."
" Only the novel
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,7,"I wonder if I was the only person to think anything apart from what was from the novel, was just boring. Probably half of Amy's screen time was her reacting to parts of his story. I would like to see a movie solely based on the novel because I want to see more of Aaron Taylor-Johnson in the role he portrayed.I watched this movie solely because of Michael Shannon's nomination for supporting actor as Bobby Andes, he did well but personally I felt A) Other nominees deserve it more than he does B) Aaron Taylor-Johnson should have been recognised for his part.Don't get me wrong, the movie was very well shot and liked all the scenes done from the novel, I just did not like any scene that was not."
" engaging and stylish but unfulfilling
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,5,"this is my first ever review. I am writing this not because I particularly and/or excessively liked or hated anything about it, but because there is this aesthetic aura about this movie that piqued my interest more than any other movie I've seen lately. so, starting with the merits of the movie. it has style. this may sound very simple and mediocre but to keep up a classy theme in a movie, especially one that is supposed to communicate with the audiences on a subliminal level, is a hard thing. u can't depend on the costumes and the settings too much because that would make it pretentious and unfeeling. u have to create an air that is posh and appealing and also very human so that the audience feel an attraction and this movie does all that beautifully. the music also helps a lot.the acting is very strong. the aforementioned style is completely embodied by amy adams who shines in this movie. her character is very pragmatic and yet very emotional at the same time, which seems like a completely contradictory blend of traits but she delivers it masterfully, and is a treat to watch. and the flow of the movie. I call it flow because I can't tell where one act ends and the other begins, assuming there are any acts. the movie is very engaging from the start and it is not slow but it is also not fast paced. it just takes you in and you return to the real world only when its finished. now even with all those qualities when the movie finally finishes, you can't help but feel a void. like the story isn't complete. this movie is a revenge tale so naturally you feel approaching towards a climax by the end, but unfortunately it fails to deliver that. while watching it the subtitles suddenly stopped and I found it very odd because that usually happens by the end. so I thought maybe something drastic will happen in these final moments that wouldn't require any dialogues and I was waiting for it when suddenly the screen blacked out. and then the credits rolled. and I felt a little disappointed. the ending sequence is also a bit confusing. I had to read an explanation on the internet to understand what those final moments meant, and I understood it and it even changed the outlook of the entire movie for me. but it still wasn't good enough."
" Just a joke on poor Amy Adams
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,6,"Nocturnal Animals, the second film from Tom Ford, is the rare movie that has two endings. First, there's the ending of Nocturnal Animals, the book, which author Tony (Jake Gyllenhaal) has sent to his ex-wife, Susan (Amy Adams), for mysterious reasons. The book follows Edward Sheffield (Gyllenhaal again) as he clumsily tries to avenge the rapes and murders of his wife and daughter. It ends with Sheffield lying facedown in the dirt, accidentally shooting himself in the stomach after killing the man who terrorized his family. Oh, and he's also been struck in the eye with a farming implement. Not exactly a happy ending.But it's not that much more depressing than that the ending of Nocturnal Animals, the movie, which closes on Adams's Susan, sitting at an opulent Los Angeles restaurant, finishing off her second expensive cocktail, waiting for Tony to arrive. He never does.So, what the hell's going on here? Is this all just a joke on poor Amy Adams? Why did Tony dedicate the book to her?On the surface, Nocturnal Animals plays as a thriller in the Sam Peckinpah mold, a brutal allegory about the worst natures of men, mostly because of the story-within-the-story. Tony's novel is pitch- black and disturbing, and Susan's real life is aesthetically beautiful but devoid of substance, an empty exercise in wealth and beauty. (Ironically, a common criticism of Ford's own work.)It's in Susan's narrative that you can begin to suss out the complexity of the plot, which all dovetails in that ending. First, we have to go back to the beginning, and end, of Tony and Susan's relationship. They meet as students, but divorce when Susan finds herself exhausted by Tony's sensitivity, the thing that drew her to him in the first place. She leaves him for Hutton Morrow, the kind of stone-hewn alpha male who could only be played by Armie Hammer. After the breakup, Tony writes the novel he could never manage when he was with Susan, full of the type of vicious, aggressive action she seemed to be encouraging him toward.Meanwhile, as Susan becomes transfixed by the book, we see a strange mirroring of its violence in the world around her. The movie's first scene takes place at a gallery opening, where naked obese women dance around on video, a layered misogyny she seems, at most, ambivalent about. And as Susan falls deeper into Tony's novel, these images keep appearing: an animal pierced by arrows; a painting on the wall that says ""REVENGE""; an apparition appearing in a colleague's cell phone. The art world is often criticized for celebrating subversion for subversion's sake, but here, in light of her ex-husband's descent into hell, these images take on actual meaning. As an artist, Tony's work turns out to be disturbing and affecting, seducing Susan all over again with what seems to be the only grain of truth in her life.Which brings us back to the final scene. Tony ghosts on Susan at their planned meeting, forcing her to confront her own superficiality, how easily she's won back. On one hand, it's a childish thing to do, rubbing her face in her own attraction; on the other, it's the ultimate rejection of what he represents to her. For Ford, Tony seems to represent integrity, a person seeking truth and finding it at great cost. (Does he also represent, for the sophomore director, the virtues and opportunities of cinema? Maybe!) Susan, then, signifies the empty promise of luxury for its own sake. (Ergo, fashion, if we're going full psychoanalyst here.) After all, in the book Tony's doppelgänger loses everything twice over: His family is taken from him, and his pursuit of revenge costs him his life. Considering the book's ending, Tony's final rejection of Susan might also be costing him his life — but it's the only choice he has.At least those cocktails looked good."
" Overcooked wanna be noir with decent acting by a top-notch cast
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,8,"NOCTURNAL ANIMALS (2016) *** Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Isla Fisher, Ellie Bamber, Armie Hammer, Karl Glusman, Robert Aramayo, Laura Linney, Michael Shannon, Jena Malone, Kristin Bauer van Straten. Overcooked wanna be noir from filmmaker Tom Ford who's flashy style over substance adaptation of Austin Wright's novel - tends to supersede the otherwise fair at best and overrated at most display of decent acting by a top-notch cast in an otherwise B-movie film circa 1961: to wit -- icily off-putting art gallery proponent Adams faces a few hurdles including her dying marriage to wooden Hammer and a new wrinkle : ex-husband Gyllenhaal's sudden re-entrance via a new manuscript that appears to have a genuinely unsettling affect on her psyche. The back-and-forth from reality to the pouring outs of the novel are indeed novel but again the actors summoned give it their all particularly Shannon (copping a richly deserved Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor) as the unspooling murder mystery's cancer-stricken lawman hellbent on solving a viciously violent final case at any cost. Beautifully shot by Seamus McGarvey."
" I get both sides of the reviews..
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,4,"I get why some people are hating and others are loving this movie. big bucks were spent on it looking and sounding nice with good performances from everyone in it. Everything is really well done, and everything looks amazing about it. But... there is still the slight problem of it being an awful movie. Firstly, you know the novel will be a tale of revenge, of course he'll get revenge. And my first thought was, I bet he just shoots him, like in most American revenge movies, sure he's spent hours raping and torturing your family but a quick death after a shot or two in the heart while he's laughing as he reminisces about it is the type revenge you seek. So when exactly that inevitably happened I thought the one good thing about the story of the movie was ruined. As until then the storyline of the book was pretty good.The rest though, was just unnecessary to the extreme, even the premise of the movie is described as a woman who interprets the novel as a symbolic revenge tale, well his revenge is even worse than the one in the novel... he stands her up for a dinner date at an expensive restraint so she just drinks on her own... With a better ending, the novel story was actually good, some of it quite gritting, so i can't completely knock this, but the rest was so bad.. maybe it'll hit a chord for a few rich arty socialites, but for everyone else it's just a bit pants."
" Do not believe in negative critics. This movie is brilliant!
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,10,"I have just recently seen this movie and I came here straight after to see people reactions on IMDb. I am so shocked about the negative reviews. Such a surprise for me to see how many people don't understand simple things and than complaining about the movie being crap. This movie is the most satisfying film that I have ever seen. So brilliantly crafted, acted and directed. Let me tell you something. If you still have not seen the movie yet, WATCH IT! And think about this little SPOILER: At the end of the movie everyone gets what they deserve. And they get it so brilliantly that is mind blowing! Btw I was shocked when I learned the director is American. I was pretty sure he is European. The style of the movie is really similar to a very good but underrated European ""film d'arte""..."
" This movie is mind blowing.
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,9,"This is my review ever, I usually don't write them but this movie is gripping in all it's way. You will be glued to your screen till the end. Some parts of the movie will keep you thinking and Tom Ford's visual symbols throughout the movie are mind boggling and blowing at the same time. You will not lose a moment of gaze while watching and thinking what could possibly happen next. This movie is gripping in all it's ways."
" Full of Highs and Lows, Nocturnal Animals Ends up Somewhere in the Middle
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,6,"This was another movie I just didn't have the access to because of the limited release. Most of the people who wanted to see this were either familiar with the book (Tony and Susan) or they were excited because Tom Ford was directing (he made the very well received A Simple Man which I've yet to see). I was interested because of how dark the trailer made the movie look, it looked like a combination of The Words (the story within a story element) and a horror movie. Having seen it now, this movie is definitely more for the art-house crowd, there was some good stuff in it but the imagery and pace of the movie are far from the norm.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) seems to have everything that she could want but she remains unhappy. She has a new exhibit (the movie opens with the art displayed at her show, some morbidly obese women dancing with sparklers), she lives in a magnificent house and she has an impressive spouse in Hutton Morrow (Armie Hammer). Further examination gives us some clues, there seems to be very little passion for the art she's displaying. Her marriage is falling apart, Hutton and Susan's interactions are cooler than a winter storm. We also find out that Hutton has run into some financial troubles. She's taken aback one day because she receives a manuscript for a book by courier. It was written by her ex-husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) and personally dedicated to her. He leaves a note with the package asking for her feedback but as she begins to read it, she becomes more concerned with the subject matter than how well it was written.I was warned about the start of Nocturnal Animals and still somehow I was taken aback by it. It wasn't fun to watch, I got the point of what it was trying to say, it just seemed to be more in there for shock value than to add to the story somehow. I did my best to push past it though, I just took it as the creative team setting up the visual style for the film. This movie is gorgeous for most of it's run time. The cinematography takes full advantage of the desert vistas, combining beautiful camera work with great atmosphere. The costuming was impressive too, the vibrant clothing added to the cool and sterile feel of this world.I'll admit this was one of the creepiest thrillers I've seen lately. The movie instills this uneasy feeling in you for most of the run time, whether you're in Susan's reality or in Edward's story. The movie is appropriately dark and with the subject matter they're dealing with, that definitely fits. Some violent and malicious things go down in Nocturnal Animals and to make light of it would feel wrong and out of place.I could see why this movie garnered some awards attention for the acting categories, I just would have picked different actors in the cast. Amy Adams did a good job with what she was given. She has to act so emotionally withdrawn for most of the film which keeps you from bonding with her character, I guess that was the desired effect. Jake Gyllenhaal gets the more intense part and just like every other movie he's made lately, he delivers. I think the more noticeable performances came in the supporting roles. Aaron Taylor-Johnson brought it up to the next level for this movie. I still didn't quite buy him as a violent sociopath redneck but this was easily my favourite performance by him. I ended up liking Michael Shannon the best, the guy is one of the best character actors out there and he knows just how to play things low-key enough to be effective. Laura Linney was really great in the short amount of time she was in the movie. Armie Hammer wasn't as charismatic as Johnson or Shannon but he's pitch perfect beside Amy Adams.My biggest issue with Nocturnal Animals (other than the weird beginning) was the fact that one of the two stories was so much more interesting than the other. The story in Edward's novel is full of drama and very intense, you definitely want to know where the story is going and what is going to happen next. It was so creepy that every time they cut away from it, I kept hoping they would go back. Telling a story in a story is difficult and I really do think that this movie did it better than most. The problem is that everything actually happens to Susan seems very mundane by comparison.This movie had almost completely won me back but then the ending fizzled out. I dug how Edward's story wrapped up but there's this big overarching metaphor of revenge and you think that Susan's going to get her comeuppance in the end. But the final notes of the story are very civil and more realistic. I respect their decision to head in that direction but it felt like a lot of buildup for nothing.This is one of those movies that seems destined to be adored by some and despised by the rest. I can see both sides of that, I found things to like and things to brush off. I wish that this movie had been a little more toned-down, I think that would have helped free up the story a bit better. I liked this movie better than I didn't by the end but I won't be revisiting it any time soon. Watch this at your own risk, if the synopsis doesn't interest you, this won't be your cup of tea."
" The Vidiot Reviews...
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,7,"Nocturnal AnimalsThe hardest part of writing a best selling novel is finding a talented enough ghostwriter. Fortuitously, the author in this thriller has found his own voice.Successful art curator Susan (Amy Adams) is shocked to receive a manuscript from her ex- husband (Jake Gyllenhaal). It tells of a family man whose family (Isla Fisher, Ellie Bamber) is murdered, and his work with an ailing detective (Michael Shannon) to bring their killer (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) to justice.Filled with allusions to the affair she had with her current husband (Armie Hammer), Susan can't help but be moved by this gesture, especially since her present marriage is deteriorating. With its superb cast and ethereal direction from Tom Ford, this absorbing, multilayered and multi-narrative psychological love story beautifully blurs the lines between fact and fiction, inspiration and revenge.Nevertheless, literary retaliation is the exact reason why you shouldn't marry a writer. Well, that and alcoholism. Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
" hey ford, can you make another masterpiece like this ?
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,9,"i just finished watching nocturnal animals, it is great it is wonderful. the soundtrack is great and i liked the idea of a story inside a story. jack Gyllenhaal as usual was great, his facial expressions and i felt his tragedy although he didn't say much and Amy Adams too. i felt her inner pain.. the way she was at her gallery after the show ended, when she called her husband and knew he was cheating, when she called her daughter. u can see sadness in her eyes. the total theme of Nocturnal Animals is sad, and it deeply touches you. Susan ( Amy Adams) left her ex husband because she thought he can't be in her future. he misunderstood that it was because his weakness which also appeared at the final scene when Ray called him weak !! that's why he shooted him..other than that, he wouldn't. he sent her that book to tell her i am not weak, i am not an awful writer, i wrote a story about myself again and you'll feel my pain and sadness all over you life .. and you'll be regretting and will be alone which i think the last scene in the restaurant revealed it . allover, it is a great experience, the acting the plot the general atmosphere of the movie, the moral of it, the stylish theme of tom ford as we know. if you wanna lose yourself in a dramatic deep touchy journey. go for NOCTURNAL ANIMALS."
" A brilliant movie only if you probably can relate to the character in the movie
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,10,"First of all, I am SHOCKED by the negative reviews this movie has got, but I ""somewhat"" can understand, these people didn't ""get"" the movie, this movie is a piece of art, literally I have never seen anything this well told before. The point of this movie is way beyond the cinematic play or the script itself, it's much deeper than that, it's one of those movies that need to come with a catalog to explain to people what happened there, luckily enough I can relate to the character so I understood what the movie is trying to tell me. This movie is NOT a thriller or an action movie, it's not a ""police"" one either, it's a movie about a broken heart, that took 19 years to try to fix itself and eventually it did, and the ones that broke that heart eventually got to pay for it....... It's so deep and touching like no other, a must watch if you have been hurt in love."
" One of the WORST movies I have ever seen. Shocked at high ratings
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,1,I cannot believe this movie is rated higher than 1.0.I cannot believe it is way above a rating of 7! How is this possible? It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.I cannot believe how bad this movie is considering the star power it has.100% disjointed and confusing.Total lack of Plot.Total lack of anything.Main character is exasperating as hell.Do not waste your time on this pathetic movie.So disappointing.
" Chilling and beautifully acted
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,8,"This film was a wonderful exhibition of acting and cinematography. You can clearly see the work of Tom Ford in it and there are many things that draw comparisons to his debut film 'a single man.' Stylistically it is similar, most notably through the musical score. What impressed me most about it was the symbolism of the book that Amy Adams reads. You can clearly see that the wife of Tony represents Amy Adams' character in real life and what she used to be, from Edward's perspective. The character of Ray Marcus seems to represent what Susan then became from Edwards perspective after the terrible things she did to him. Ford also drops various visual cues in the story, such as the red couch that he finds his dead wife and daughter on, that represent things in the real-life narrative. Overall, the film was a technical wonder. The only reason I couldn't rate it higher was because the script didn't quite match the other aspects of the film and the themes the film was trying to explore were unclear. However, the film remains a harrowing piece of work and a great second feature film by Tom ford."
" Strangely underwhelming ending
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,6,"*** WARNING ALL PARTS OF THIS REVIEW SPOIL THE ENDING OF THE MOVIE ***He stood her up. *That* was his revenge after stewing on this for 19 years? *Really*? The truth is that 19 years had passed, it's a lifetime! Even if he knew her that well and guessed right that she'd live to regret her choice he had no way of knowing at which point in her life she was. He didn't know about her husband's ""financial troubles"", he didn't know she knew she was being cheated on or that she was feeling empty nest syndrome. For it to be any sort of revenge he had to hurt her emotionally, just standing her up would be the equivalent of Tony telling Bobby he was fine with Ray walking away with it. Given that Tony kills Ray only to die himself I expected Edward to pull a Vicomte de Valmont, show up for dinner, chat with her, quickly realize she was ripe for being seduced and then dump her after sex with ""wow, you really *did* become your mother"" or something else really cruel and personal. You know, really drive in the dagger even if it hurt him as well and still left him empty after 19 years. For all he knows she got *annoyed* and bitched about how her loser ex- husband and his shitty novel wasted her time while she and her husband planned their upcoming scuba diving vacation in Bora Bora over the phone.I dunno... seems strangely underwhelming for something that took him 19 years to cook."
" One of a kind experience.
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,10,"Easily the best film I have seen this year. Great performance by all the actors, fantastic plot with a lot of deep meaning and a very atmospheric soundtrack. It's a very unique film. It reminds me of Basic Instinct but without the sex and drugs. It looks like a 90s masterpiece brought from back in time, a solid prove that Tom Ford is a great director.True love comes once in a lifetime, and we rarely get a second chance. This film is about revenge and personal progress in life, Its about how the decisions of the past can haunt our lives in the future and how the pain we cause to others always comes back to us. This movie sends a strong message to the people who easily give up on other people and never give them a fair chance to shine.I can't understand why some people rated this movie 1/10, just the performance of the actors and the soundtrack of the film should be enough to give it a solid 5."

Thanks God I didn't pay attention to all the misguided comments about this movie, Nocturnal Animals is a beautiful & stylish movie, great photography, solid acting and a solid plot that will stay with you long after you finish it. I don't understand why there's so much envy and hate in the film industry, the wannabe movie critics can't take that a guy who came from the fashion world actually can created a pretty good movie.

" Fell asleep after an hour and EXTREMELY misogynistic
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,1,"The psycho that directed this film needs to see a therapist to deal with his issues towards women. People said 50 shades of grey was bad, it was nothing in comparison. Whether obese, tween or thin, all women were objectified and nude in this movie. It begins with like 10 minutes of an obese naked woman dancing. IT was like watching a Dove commercial that did not want to end. Totally pointless. The director just wanted to emphasize the kind of body that is unacceptable (considered disgusting) in society. We got the message after about one minute! How about showing some anorexics as well? Or, how about showing some obese men?You already know a male directed the film, and clearly one that has some serious issues towards obese women. Any overweight woman watching the beginning of the film would be disgusted with herself. It was just plain cruel. (I am petite and skinny, as a side note, but I was still grossed out.) My interpretation of the director of this film and writer of this book is that he sees women as a binary: 1) attractive and self-absorbed and 2) obese. Women are nothing but mere objects to him and he is strongly prejudiced against women.He makes it seem as though women do not want guys that are highly sensitive, but they like jerks who cheat on them. There is nothing intelligent about this movie or that simple assumption. You do not see guys wanting to date women who make them feel demasculinized because the female is more masculine. In fact, a lot of men I know have dumped women simply because their girl friend was making more money at work. In the end, she made the right choice dumping the guy because he was not a real man, he could not protect her or her daughter from being raped and murdered. He acted like a girl would be expected to act. He only protected himself. He was utterly useless! Men suck and it is best to stay single is the message I got from the movie.Lastly, if you cannot fall asleep, this movie is the perfect sedative. It was so boring. I have never fallen asleep during a movie, but this movie was all over the place. The most boring parts you have to sit through to hear about the interesting parts that are not even part of the movie, but part of a book. I do not understand the high reviews for this film. If you write a paper or a novel that is all over the place like this movie, it would receive a big REJECT. Peer-reviewers would destroy your written work for the lack of a consistent story line. If this were written for a course, you would receive a failing grade on it and be encouraged to take writing classes. Yet in this film, there is no real beginning or end, it is all over the place and drags at times, has no consistent story line, and this disastrous mess gets a pass? What I learned from watching the film. If you are a HORRIBLE writer, make films for a living instead and call it art."
" mesmerizing visuals with thriller
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,9,"The second film from designer turned directory Tom Ford was not just a visual masterpiece but had great narrative. The plot of the movie which is three narratives combined into one and tells the story of Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) an art gallery owner who receives a manuscript of her ex-husband's (Jake Gyllenhaal) thriller novel dedicated to her. The way that the story was told was bold, strange and very unique to me. Even though a movie with three narratives might sound clumsy but it wasn't, the stories of different time lines did not overlap each other rather it made the story complete with showing different aspects of the characters.Aaron Taylor-Johnson's performance as Ray Marcus was definitely my favorite, he was so creep and repulsive to watch. The brilliant Michael Shannon was also in this movie as Bobby Andes with great Oscar worthy performance. Overall, I loved this movie for it's visual look and appeal of it's leading characters. While I was watching the movie I liked Tom Ford's directing style, storytelling, cinematography and after watching it I started to think about it while connecting the dots between the different narratives and it easily became my favorite movie to think about. If you really like movies that makes you think and eventually re-watch them over again then this movie is for you."
" Boring
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,3,"A movie about a book. Nothing new. Hold up, wait, try this! A movie about reading a book. WTF? Were you thinking? Why would anyone consider this a good idea? Oh, my mistake, not even a book. A manuscript! So much better. Right? Wrong...Not gonna lie, Jake Gyllenhaal is great in this and really drew me into his character's side of the story. However being brought out of it and into some nonsense about a totally fake feeling and incomplete character reading the story is ridiculous. She is the main character and not even close to fleshed out, her dress and make up are demure and boring on purpose which could have been interesting if there was anything explaining her motivations or lifestyle choices, however instead there are silent shots panning around bland environments in muted tones and ugly colors. I know the design choices were made on purpose to be unappealing, but just leave it out instead of wasting your production budget on stupid-expensive looking sets/locations. Poor kids love that sh*t tho so of course that what we get. I think if just the guys story were presented in a re-edited version it would be a solid, if a little cliché, film at a watchable length around an hour twenty tops. As it is, it is way too long and visually dis- interesting, off- putting, and bland to make sitting through almost 2 hours a worthwhile use of anyone's time."
" I watch the nocturnal predator look at human weakness
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,9,"""Night Animals"" has a charm that few will have the perception to notice, it's like a shell inside a shell, you have to open it twice, with good performances and great technical resources, with an initial credit scene that satirizes The American visceral way - although disconnected from the rest of the film - we have here a great work forgotten by the great awards. Contemplate the story of Susan (Amy Adams), who after a painful break with her husband 20 years ago finds herself thinking about him constantly, especially after receiving a manuscript of it. I do not think there is anything that can be claimed about the plot, because it uses more of the visual subjectivity than the script, the script is very self explanatory and even with only two hours of movies, it is enough to develop All the characters, we can even have a dubio ending that can make us question the quality of it, but after a little reflection, you will give up the questionings. The film has a moral that talks about the weakness of the human being, and weakness here is explored from all sides, from the physical to the spiritual, from the psychological to the emotional, all the characters at some point experience this weakness (I Talk more about it in the spoiler part), the film also contains several extremely cliché critiques of the American way of life and conservatism. The photograph of this film is simply beautiful, with lots of shades of blue and gray, it's a heavy, tense, loaded photograph, and as if it weighed on the shoulders of our characters, with daring camera angles, full of open plans and subjective cameras that Tom brings a lot of interesting angles, and now one thing about the film that touched me, and a lot, its soundtrack, it is so simple and at the same time so complex and linear, it talks a lot about the movie, and when the We are listening, it is almost an invitation to reflect on what is being shown on screen. We have 2 sensational actors here, who do what they expect in their roles - although nothing that animates much, although Jake is excellent - these actors are Amy Adams Jake Gylenhaa (who plays 2 different characters), but whoever ends up robbing the screen completely is Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor- Johnson, with their spectacular detective and psychopath. Finally, the film of the experimental Tom Ford completely divides the critical world out, but at least for me, the film is excellent for its simplicity, honesty, clarity and beauty as it deals with its themes. One of the things that divide criticism is its end, and the grace of this end, is that it can be millions of interpretations, that's the grace of the art, each one understood in a different way, for me, Jake's character only Wanted to show that that weak part of him no longer exists, he writes the book as a form of revenge on the abortion carried out by Susan, because the book talks about what he went through having lost his daughter, but in an extremely exaggerated way, we have All the stages, pain, suffering, repentance and acceptance, and at the end when Susan invites him to see him, he will not, because that guy who accepted the suffering caused by Susan dies along with his character in the book."
" When you love Movies you have to be careful with them, you might never get 'em again.
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,8,"So I just Finished Nocturnal Animals and to put as bluntly as possible I absolutely loved it and it might end up being one of my top 10 favorite movie of the year. Well it's basically two movies in one. One half appeals to my lust for grim blood soaked, dark genre fare while the other half plays like an interpersonal glossy drama that's just as compelling. Both feel as if they could hold entire films in their own right and grabbed me till the very end. It's much better if you go in cold so I won't really say much more but if you love a good thriller, crime drama or just good film making in general and it's playing near you please do yourself a favor and let Mr Tom Ford take you on a trip through some movie magic."
" A Masterpiece
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,9,"Again and again another masterpiece for Jake Gyllenhaal . This guy is unbelievable. Thank you Tom Ford for making this great movie. the way you link between them in the movie is amazing. Jake Gyllenhaal was very quiet throughout the movie. after Amy Adams left him for another man, he didn't lose his patience. he lost his second wife and his daughter and because he is a very kind man he didn't think about anything bad. I think he thought about good more than bad may be this his mistake. For me I know that Edward knew from deep inside that he is coward. he only need someone to believe in him. If you can see his way of expressing his happiness for killing Lou. his feeling is mixed between joy and anger. Edward wanted to end his wife and daughter case between him and him. So after killing Ray he felt he can leave everything. Edward weakness point is coward. he was very brace till the end for my opinion. At the end I think anyone enjoyed the movie can remember his word "" you have the same sadness eye as your mother""- Edward said. The last scene was amazing. I can't stop thinking about this movie especially Jake Gyllenhaal. You have to watch it anyway."
" It can't get worse than this
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,1,"This is the ultimate crap of a movie. If you want to cringe for an hour and 56 minutes, then go and see it. We have Jake Gyllenhaal who is both Tony Hastings and Edward Sheffield. Well, one of them is his fictional character, or maybe he is not. That's something you will understand once the movie is over. Now, after you realize who is who and who did what and why... you will say: AND THAT'S IT?!. This is the type of movie you go to watch because of the cast, and don't get me wrong, Amy Adams did one hell of a job in this, and Michael Shannon was awesome as he is in all of his movies, but that's it. This ""movie"" doesn't have a meaning. It doesn't have any message. It's just a 1.56 hours of ""something"", and I bet that even the producer doesn't know what it is. Yes, i'm talking to you Tom Ford. There are easier jobs if you did not know. You can work in McDonald's for example. That job requires as much imagination and logic as you put in while working on Nocturnal Animals."
" It's like stopping sex half way through - For no reason.
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,4,"As another reviewer here put it, ""it's like sex without the orgasm"". I'll add to that a little and say it's like having sex with your gorgeous lifelong friend of the opposite sex.Hard to get started but you eventually find your rhythm, then you really start enjoying it. Just as you really start rocking and rolling, your partner gets up and goes home without saying a word.I really wanted to see this film. I mean sandwich me between Amy Adams and Isla Fisher and I'll die happily ever after, it had all I wanted - except a plot.This film feels like everyone went home and forgot to put the ending in. You can create all the new age explanations you want but they won't redeem this film.A very dark, sinister and incomplete offering...."
" Biggest load of rubbish ever!
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,1,This film was an absolute waste of my time. I was bored from the outset but tried to give it a chance and now wish I hadn't. The most boring artsy crap film I've ever had the misfortune of watching and has no point to it whatsoever. I'd have had more fun having a nap! I do not understand the overall rating this film gets. Biggest load of rubbish ever. I would never recommend this film to anyone else as I feel so strongly disappointed with it. I'd advise Watching anything else but this! I'd not watch this again if it was the only thing available to watch that's how bad I found it. Definitely choose to sleep rather than watching this!
" Beautiful Masterpiece
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,9,"Nocturnal Animals is probably the best kept secret of 2016.The film demonstrates superb directing, the visuals are indelible and the cast is amazing.The story-line is beautifully crafted and gets an A+ for me. I think the major takeaway is that Edward vicariously lives through his fictional character Tony; who demonstrates the strength that he has been accused of lacking from Susan and all the other characters in the film he had a connection with (Susan's Mom, her current husband etc).Also let's dissect the title of the film and the title of the manuscript. ""Nocturnal Animals"" was an ode to Susan. Throughout the film she showcases classic signs of insomnia. Looking at the events in the manuscript one can ask why did Edward/Tony drive his family in the middle of nowhere in the night time, that seems a bit odd. In a way it seems both Edward and Susan are nocturnal animals. The nighttime is their escape from the harsh realities of the world and the underwhelming feelings that reside.The film has so many interpretations that it can have the viewer confused. What exactly is the morale of this film? However the beauty is being engrossed in the film to find out. I rarely look at films twice but this most likely will definitely be one."
" I really wanted to love this movie, but just couldn't
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,1,"First, the opening scenes of this movie were both startling and meaningless at the same time. I actually never felt so uncomfortable in a movie theater, and this scene did that for me. I was hoping the rest of the movie would be better.I have to admit that the acting was superb, and the cast was amazing, but the movie itself just didn't click for me. Mike Shannon was great in his role; I was blown away by his acting, but, unfortunately, not his character. Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal were also great in their respective roles as well. Again, the acting was superb, but the characters, plot and pace of this movie left little to be desired.Not that I didn't get the drift of the movie,that was quite clear, but I think the movie tried too hard to be clever, and the story lines got jumbled and diluted because of that fact. The visuals in this movie are dramatic and vivid... but not enough to drag this one out of the basement. I had to ask myself at the ending if that was ""it"". Not worth the money and not worth my time."
" Don't be fooled by the positive ratings
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,1,"Whenever I see words like 'stylish' 'inventive' etc etc I immediately get suspicious. I picture a drug addled Hollywood elite 'writer' smoking his bong while writing his/her inchoate but 'subtle' FY to America extolling the 'genius' of the left wing 'creative' 'artistic' ('writers' 'artists' and of course 'actors' and other 'Hollywood types') intelligentsia over regular working stiffs or successful individuals. This pretentious movie fits that mold. Look closely and you will see the Hollywood elite message of disparagement of signs of success (beautiful homes etc) as evil and the 'heroic' image of the 'writer' who is better than that and who exacts his impolite so called revenge(?). Of course, it is the Hollywood elite, the few who achieve financial success, who flaunt wealth and excess far more than everyone else. Who really lives in Malibu and Beverly Hills? If that is your mindset and you are willing to overlook a confused and inchoate 'plot', believe this is a 'thriller', and buy the line that this self-absorbed tripe is some expression of a greater 'intelligence' then this is your movie ... not mine"
" Why oh why was this movie made
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,3,"Man oh man, where do I start? Producers were probably thinking the same thing, how do I make a movie out of this. Well they did a very bad job of whatever the hell they were trying to do. I thought at first it could be good but just went downhill all the way through. Hollywood does this a lot, make a movie with no substance and assume the audience is going to make something out of nothing. And a lot of reviews here did just that. Tried to find sophistication in something that was just done poorly. Amy Adams, what can I say. She could be in anything and there are many that will rave about her just for the appearance. I'm not going that route. She has been pretty boring to me and her staring into space that she does in all her movies just doesn't cut it for me anymore. Another rather repetitive move by Hollywood is to think they can throw anything together with good actors in it and it automatically will be a good movie. This movie was disjointed and empty. At the end I'm sitting there and going, ""what, how did I just sit through this"". Hollywood got me again, just wasted a couple more hours of my life. Thanks Hollywood."
" Read a book with Amy Adams
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,6,"Here we have ""Nocturnal Animals"", an American movie written and directed by Tom Ford. For Ford, it is only his second movie despite him being already in his mid-50s. The first was ""A Single Man"" from 2009 that brought Colin Firth his first Oscar nomination. And this one we have here got Michael Shannon his second actually. These almost two hours were among the big players this awards season, even if it did come short at the Oscars. It won Aaron Taylor-Johnson a surprise Golden Globe and got Ford screenplay and director nominations. And at the BAFTAs, it scored even more attention. The two lead actors here are Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal, but they are not half as memorable as Shannon or ATJ. At least, in Adams' favor you can say that she is not really part of the core story and does not have too much to work with compared to others, but just of the framework, while Gyllenhaal once again ends up very underwhelming despite having the baitiest moments of the movie. On Adams, make-up and hair design still make her somewhat memorable. Shannon's success here says a lot really. The character was not written too well. The story of a cop who has nothing to lose because of a disease isn't anything new. There are no baity moments with him and his son and the cancer reference is also nothing that got elaborated on. But still Shannon gives easily the most memorable performance of the movie and that deserves all the awards he can get. ATJ wasn't bad either, but honestly a Golden Globe may have been a bit too much, maybe it also has to do with the fact that we see him naked and wiping his ass or with the transformation he managed since Kick-Ass.Anyway, now about the story itself. We have a woman who gets the manuscript of the new book by her ex-husband and while the story early on is still about her, the more it goes on the more it is really about her having moments of fear from what she is reading. Adams is sure much better than this. So yeah, the heart and soul is really the book itself and it's actually a really interesting idea by Ford here that we are basically visually reading a book in this movie. Something pretty new and refreshing. But there are weaknesses too, for example the worst moment was probably a jump scare scene involving a baby that could have been taken out of a really bad horror film and added nothing of quality at all. The ending of Gyllenhaal's character makes hardly no sense at all. But luckily, this film has Shannon and, to a lesser extent, Taylor-Johnson who still make it all work, even if the connection between the two scenarios feels extremely vague to me. It's more like two films in one and the one with Adams is extremely forgettable, while the other is okay, but nothing too new either, but luckily gets carried by two good performances. This is why overall I give this one a thumbs-up. Quality-wise, it is roughly what I expected, not a great film by any means, but kinda entertaining thanks to its style. Watch it, especially if you like some of the actors."
" 6.7 out of 10 but I'm rounding down
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,6,"To paraphrase Hunter S Thompson, ""it never got crazy enough for me."" That is my feeling about this movie. Given the subject matter, it could have been darker, could have been rawer, it could have been better. It seemed to stop short along all lines. I mean, you're already making a rated R movie about the worst of humanity, why hold back? The underlining story is good but the resulting film doesn't take it to the next level, what a shame. I guess this movie is okay at best, it was just in need of a few gut punches and because of that, it will not be remembered 10 years from now by most. Yeah, this movie is hugely overrated."
" Spoiler alert: This movie is weird and pretty, but not much else..
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,2,"Starts out weird and ends without closure. I know the art geeks seem to love it, but it was just plain bad. The only redeeming factor here is that one of Gylenhall's characters dies, as he well should have for being a complete pu**y. The 7.7 rating is ridiculous but not shocking seeing as how weird movies that are all art and conjecture seem to get higher ratings than films that are actually entertaining and clever. The actors all do a fine job with their characters but the story line is entirely too convoluted to be entertaining. Not surprising that this pile didn't make back the initial investment (at least according to IMDb box office stats).Don't bother going out to see this mess. If you're out of things to watch on netflix or amazon or whichever service ends up with this thing, turn the TV off and go the gym. You'll be better off."
" Living Well's the Best Revenge
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,9,"That's some terrifying stuff right there! Fashion designer Tom Ford has written and directed his second movie, a multifaceted revenge thriller which is even better than his first, 2009's ""A Single Man"".Both are visually stylish, of course, which is expected from fashion guru, both have interesting premise and good actors, and both have this cold, unsettling atmosphere which tries to keep the viewer at some distance.In short, Ford has managed to take everything good from his solid debut project and bring it to the next level with ""Nocturnal Animals"". It's more lively, gripping, effortlessly cool and deeper. There are two stories, interwined in a way which may make viewers wonder whether it's real or imagined by the character. But it is ambiguous in a best possible way, not trying to f--k with our minds and then leave us hanging.An unhappily married woman (Amy Adams) thinks she wants his first husband (Jake Gyllenhaal) back. And she reads his novel, a violent thriller, which seems like a revenge tale. And then things get more, er, complex.On-screen events are exciting already but Ford the writer turns out surprisingly skillful at making it even varied, without getting stuck or losing steam, or letting us think that we know where all this ends up. He even playfully takes jabs at his main fashion job and the lifestyle and personal sacrifices that come with it. And the whole result really makes you feel something for the characters, unlike many of the thrillers that only manage to arouse the viewer during their best bits.It's not mostly about Adams and Gyllenhaal. There is a number of smaller but important characters and cool performances. We have Michael Shannon, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Isla Fisher, Armie Hammer, Michael Sheen, Laura Linney.The cast is good enough reason to watch it. Everybody adds something worthwhile to the experience, even Sheen and Fisher and especially Linney who all have rather small roles used to move the story along. Shannon brings his usual magnetic mix of cool and creepy. Gyllenhaal manages to move between having balls and ball-less state without turning unbelievable or too heroic. Taylor-Johnson as the bad guy even got a Golden Globe for his work (the only one for the movie although Tom Ford got nominated for both best movie / drama and adapted screenplay). He really deserves it, he is evil at its most subtle and delicious. Delicious to watch, I mean.But I am especially happy about Amy Adams who is often used in the movies as just a pretty face or supporting woman. In 2016, she has had two strong roles, in a thinking man's sci-fi ""Arrival"", and now this. Her screen time may be limited but she surely makes the most of it, captivatingly playing out both worlds that the character has hiding inside her. I believed her both as a lively young woman and the jaded older one that's missing all the ideals that she had decided to throw away long time ago.Based on a novel by Austin Wright which Ford wanted to adapt into two movies initially, one true to original, the other not so much. I am not sure which way he chose ultimately but what a ride, eh?PS No, I am not giving 9 out of 10 to every movie I watch from now on. The last three have been just some of 2016's best of the best."
" Beautiful looking film, that makes you think about it afterwards!
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,10,"Susan receives a manuscript, written by her ex-husband, in which he tells a violent story. She gets very involved into the story, because she sees it as a revenge tale.Tom Ford, the designer, returns to direct another film after a hiatus of seven years. Ford shows in this film that he hasn't lost his mojo. His artistic vison really helped to create very good looking and stylish shots, with a lot of use of color, which brings its own meaning to the shot. Ford used cold colors (blue, white) in the scenes with Amy Adams (Susan) and warmer colors (red, orange) in the scenes with Jake Gyllenhaal (Tony). I haven't come to realize why he chose to use different colors for the both of them, but I have a few guesses. One of them is that he decided to do this, to show the difference between what was taking place in the book and what was taking place in ""real life"". Another guess I have is that the colder colors represent the loneliness and sadness Susan is feeling. But those are just guesses. Ford didn't only use these colors to symbolize cold and warm, but also to show emotions. Red stood for love, or death. Green stood for envy. The use of color was sublime and really made you think more about the movie. The shot composition too was very good and the camera movements as well. The use of shadow was perfect. In short: this was a gorgeous looking movie. Another thing that Tom Ford did was creating a weird film. He didn't make a straightforward film, but he created a film that has you thinking about it after you've seen it. It even starts way in the beginning with the opening credits, that were kind of weird, but fantastically set up the theme for the rest of the movie. It prepares you for what's to come and immediately shows that the movie is not your average film, but something that's different than all, which I very much enjoyed. The soundtrack I found to be fitting and original. It helped a lot to set up the scene. The editing also helped with this, but also to show the similarities between the manuscript and Susan's life. This was done in a very good manner and the pacing was good too. I didn't feel that the movie was too long or too short: it was just the right length. Due to this the film also never drags, which is of course a good thing. The acting was absolutely marvelous. Jake Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams both give excellent performances. Gyllenhaal played his character so well, that I didn't see Jake Gyllenhaal, but Tony, or at times Edward. He performed well in the emotional scenes, but he is also very good in showing the subtle character progression he goes through. Amy Adams has previously starred in this years ""Arrival"", where she plays a totally different character. It's really fascinating to see how diverse she can act, because the two characters have no correlation to each other. Like I've said: two different characters. In both cases she gave a fantastic performance, and that's why I was surprised she didn't get an Oscar nod for one of her performances. Not only Gyllenhaal and Adams gave a wonderful performance, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Michael Shannon were superb as well. Aaron Taylor Johnson was really unrecognizable. He was scary, weird and really nailed the part. Michael Shannon too was fantastic. He gave, in my opinion, the best performance of the entire film.The screenplay was also a very good adaptation. The dialogue was good, but the narrative was the thing that really spoke to me. I very much enjoyed the way how they wove together the three stories and kept it all easy to differentiate. All of the stories were very intriguing, whereby I wasn't bored a single minute. The characters were original and not clichéd. You were able to care for them and they also went through some development. I very much liked Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character. He played the main villain of the story, but the way they wrote him was brilliant. He was scary and intimidating, yet he wasn't really big, or built in a strong manner. It all came from his character. Amy Adams character was also multi-layered. At first she just seems like any other wealthy person, but as the movie progresses, you get to know her more, mostly because of the flashback scenes. The ending was also very good. It doesn't explain itself, which I like very much. This ensures that there are multiple explanations for it. ""Nocturnal Animals"" has quickly grown to be one of the best movies of 2016, in my opinion at least. The film challenges you to think about it, not only during the film, but also after the credits have stopped rolling. Tom Ford created a visually stunning film, with some weird scene, but those all have an underlying meaning to them. Because of those reasons summed up just now, I'm giving ""Nocturnal Animals"" a 9.5/10."
" Not Worth The Yawn
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,1,"Nocturnal Animals sums up what happens when fashion meets film- one big boring yawn.My one vote goes to Michael Shannon, who played his role well but not really a believable character. As a dying cop at the end of his career, I'm not convinced vigilant shootings for a stranger would be a top priority.As others have noted, while the scenes seem to be going somewhere, the whole thing falls apart with too many backstory shifts along with ridiculous fillers of bourgeois emptiness.It's shallow, it's narcissistic and void of emotional depth. The audience is left hanging with characters that stir very little emotion connection. There is no on-screen tension or suspense between the characters either.No rhyme or reason to the closing scene. Perhaps Ford thinks he's mastered a creative or experimental ending but it just doesn't work. A better take on experimental endings of a similar genre is No Country for Old Men. For me, Nocturnal Animals is not worth the yawn."
" Worst film of 2016?
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,3,"It staggers me to read so many positive reviews of this film. It is such a vacuous, pointless exercise in style and worse - it seems to have a genuinely ridiculous message. The central conceit is that Amy Adam's character should feel guilty and remorseful as she chose to betray Jake Gylenhall's character, and not have faith in his creative abilities. But it took him a decade to write this book about his betrayal, and by all accounts it seems pretty bloody awful! Is it even published? He just sent her a copy, so we have no idea. She was probably right to leave him!But even if we get past this central hollow idea, there is the problem of the craft of the film, which aims for Lynch but feels very studenty. Some scenes feel very awkwardly directed and over designed to the point where its hard to identify with anyone or anything on screen. I almost forgot about the opening. What did that particular bit of imagery have to do with anything? Nothing whatsoever, it was just there for momentary effect - which i feel pretty much sums up the whole film. Flashy but empty."
" Sweet revenge, bitter
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,4,"Tom Ford is a real filmmaking prodigy. With just one previous directorial effort under his belt (2009's surprisingly sensual ""A Single Man""), Ford has shown exceptional talent handling actors, and he has a definite eye for composition, location shooting and how long a scene should play...what he lacks is supervision. A gallery executive, fraught with weak finances and a shaky marriage, receives the final draft of a novel her ex-husband has written. She becomes absorbed by the gruesome story of a man who loses his wife and daughter to southern yahoos in the desert--and comes to see how the painful prose is relevant to her own house-of-cards existence. ""Nocturnal Animals"", adapted by Ford from Austin Wright's novel, ""Tony and Susan"", features tightly-controlled, anguished performances from its talented cast, but is long on repellent or inscrutable detail (a mysterious car pulling up to a security gate, a paper cut bleeding like a deep wound, a naked man sitting on a toilet--and wiping himself in a tight shot), as well as cheap shots, such as a ghostly ""boo!"" coming from a baby monitor. The movie, filled with unhappy and sometimes repulsive people, is certainly a polished piece of work open to interpretation, but perhaps a more judicious editor could have eliminated Ford's unnerving penchant for excessiveness. ** from ****"
" It wasn't until the last scene.
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,7,"It kept losing me as I saw it trying to emulate Lynch, Greenaway, --even Bond movies with its score at times-- but then --when you know he's not going to show-- that it is his delivered retort to what she did to him... that is what makes it a good film. He's left her to a future of regret, bad choices and unfulfilled possibilities. If only she'd kept the faith, believed. Not aborted his child. Had an affair. Yet, he owes her his success, so in a way he's thanking her, but bringing down upon her terrible retribution. The stark contrasts of colours, noise and silence seems overly obvious at times, even unnecessary, the game was kind of given away with the painting, the black and white REVENGE, a little more of a subtle message or none at all would have left the mind thinking for that bit longer, that little deeper. Don't feed us, make us search and forage for the answer."
" revealing feelings
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,7,"First of all there is only one story in this movie. The book is just a symbolic description of the story of relationship between two main heroes. She in her green dress imagine the color of the car (which belonged to aggressors in the book) as green. Because she was the main source of suffer in the life of her ex-husband. She was called nocturnal animal. She killed their baby and was gone. It's interesting to find more details while watching it. there are much more. What we see while she's reading are pure emotions of the man who was left alone with his own struggle and pain. But, though he imagines himself as a strong man ready to go ahead and win, we can see that she was actually right to call him ""weak"". He didn't get his revenge: neither fictional nor in real life. Because he still needs someone to believe in him, someone supporting and he himself doesn't know what to do when he gets to the final (accidental shot helps the fictional hero, but it also brings him blindness and death while the author simply didn't show up for a date)."
" A frightening film
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,2,"Do NOT watch this film if you're planning a road trip through Texas. It might scare you to death, as some of the scenes are extremely horrifying and disturbing. After watching this film, I couldn't get those ugly images out of my mind. Those who have seen this movie will know exactly what I'm talking about. The terrifying events are disgusting and cruel.The violence is nightmarish and will possibly keep you awake at night. In any case, you'll need a strong stomach to get through this movie. Sometimes violence is necessary for plot development.. But this particular type of violence is probably the ugliest I've ever seen on-screen."
" Masterpiece from a true film designer
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,8,"When a fashion designer like Tom Ford becomes a director, should we call him a film designer? In a certain way, his films look as if they are designed rather than directed. Like his first feature film, 'A Single Man', this follow-up is the ultimate manifestation of good taste. Clothing, interior design, art, lighting, music, even the cars: it's all carefully chosen and selected. Ford creates his own world of elegance and harmony, in which not a single element is ugly or out of place. And even when something ugly turns up, it is made into an aesthetic statement, as the hilarious and quite daring opening scene proves.In 'Nocturnal Animals', this seemingly perfect world is inhabited by rich art dealer Susan. Although she has no reason to be unhappy, she is. And she has herself to blame for it. In the course of the film, we learn what the reason is for her unhappiness: she feels empty after having made a crucial decision she now seems to regret.This reality is coming back to haunt her, when she receives a novel by post, written by her ex-husband. While she reads the book and gets gradually more upset by its content, the viewer reads it together with her. Not in text, but in images: the book is the screenplay for a film-in-the film. Susan's urban, elegant world of well-behaved, civilized people contrasts sharply with the raw, indiscriminate violence in the Texan desert, described in the book.The film-in-the-film is a neo-western, complete with hostile rednecks, a Stetson-wearing sheriff, and a landscape of endless two-lane highways crossing the emptiness. The first scene of this subplot is nothing more than perfect in its bleak agony.The frequent switches between the real world and the book story add extra depth to the film. This is enhanced when a third perspective is introduced: flashbacks from the time Susan and her ex-husband met and fell in love. Ford weaves the three stories together without any effort, and at any moment it's clear which perspective we're in.The result is a thriller with an extra layer of psychological drama, all shown in wonderful, beautiful cinematography. But 'Nocturnal Animals' is not an empty, cold, display of style. Quite on the contrary. Tom Ford almost condemns the emptiness of Susan's art world, full of hypocrites and devoid of real emotions. He shows how real feelings are much more important than pretense, that failure and dissent are to be preferred over perfection and harmony. It's almost as if he got fed up with the flashy fashion world, and chose a much more profound way of expressing his art."
" Crime thriller with a difference
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,6,"""Nocturnal Animals"" is a crime-thriller with a difference. The crime-thriller aspect is a story within a story, or in this case, a novel within a movie. Amy Adams plays a rich executive, whose ex- husband, Edward, gives her a book he has written. We see the novel acted out on screen as Adams' character reads it.In the scenes which depict the book's story, which make up the majority of the run-time, Gyllenhaal also plays the protagonist. He is driving through West Texas with his wife and daughter when he is run off the road by a group of sinister rednecks. They take the wife and daughter and leave Tony for dead. Later, Gyllenhaal's Tony encounters Michael Shannon as the lawman, a man with reasons of his own for being loose with the law.In the moments of heightened tension within this story, Adams' character quits reading and we are reminded that this is just a story-within-a-story. The frame isn't as interesting, however. Adams is now in a loveless marriage with a personality-less hunk, having ditched Gyllenhaal's Edward. Scenes from their relationship are played back to us, where we see that Edward was a true romantic, and Adams, a pragmatist. It is clear that their relationship wasn't going to work: they're simply too different.The filmmakers have made what appears to be a wise choice in having the movie's two plot lines play off each other: the framing story is suggestive and reserved, the story-within is violent and explosive. When Adams stops reading the book because it's getting too heavy, however, we're not feeling the same way. This inner story isn't as intense as it should be, and the story that frames it isn't as interesting. It's hard to feel much for Adams' character, aside from empathy with her reactions to the novel. At least that we can understand, even if we don't feel it as much as she seems to.A movie like this needs to make a stronger emotional impression in both its plot lines. We don't feel much for Adams' failed marriage because they never seemed to fit together anyway, and we don't see much of how she feels in her current picture perfect relationship, or if she really even regrets the way things turned out with Edward, or thought they could end any other way. Tony's story is a bit familiar. How many times have we seen the nice-guy-pushed-to-the- edge story, or the lawman willing to look the other way because he also hates the perpetrators?This plot line should have played more like pulp fiction to play off the seriousness of the framing story. But, I fear, the filmmakers didn't realise this material would work better that way: they take it too seriously, so we're left with two stories, one boring, the other familiar, neither particularly effective."
" Sad what amounts to a good movie today
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,2,"I struggled to watch the entire thing. Which is surprising considering it's not a long movie. But so boring it was that I just wanted it to be over. Checking every min how much more still left of this agony. I love Amy and I don't blame her for such an awful movie. I don't even know what the director was going for. U simply don't feel bad for her enough to appreciate what she is going through. I just didn't see the point of the whole thing. I hope it wins some Oscars. It will solidify in my mind what a terrible movie it is, as those are the movies that usually win. I give it a 2 just for the cast and the attempt made to make something out of nothing. Michael Shannon is good as always."
" Genius.
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,10,"Two stories lived by the same man. Both signifying the same tale. One fictional while the other having lived. Have an open mind when watching this movie. Understand why the director chooses to feed the scenes at that exact moment. If you don't understand the ending than you failed to fully grasp what this film was all about. A lot will wonder what the ending signified so I'll tell you only enough to make you watch it again if not understand instantly. Amy Adams killed Tonys girls and killed Tony in the end too. Not literally of course but symbolically that's how it happened. That book is Edward's way of F*** **** to ex wife Susan for killing his baby, killing the woman he fell in love with and ultimately killing the soft hearted person he was when she left. He stood her up and it was then that she realized how much pain she had caused him leaving her with no hope for a better life. A life she wished she'd lived out"
" Disappointment...
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,2,"I had originally heard mixed reviews on Nocturnal Animals and thought I would give it a chance because the preview left me curious of what it was about. It did not give much away like I found a lot of previews do. The movie was a complete waste of time. I felt the movie was all over the place and did not hold my attention at all. I kept hoping that something would happen, however was extremely let down. The acting was good, but the plot and the story was awful. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I question how a user rating of 10 can be given to this film. I rate this movie a 3 out 10. I found it extremely boring and dragged out. Save yourself money and your time and watch something else. I wouldn't even recommend watching it when it comes out on DVD. A massive let down of a movie with zero potential..."
" The Beauty of Ambiguity
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,9,"When more and more money is a at stake in the movie business which causes the big studios increasingly to play it safe by sticking to simple formulas when it comes to plot, any deviation from a traditional three act structure can already be considered 'unconventional'. The first of the many turns Tom Ford's second film 'Nocturnal Animals' takes, is that the viewer relatively early realises that, despite the cinematography which is more Fincher than Fincher and an A-List lead with Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal, she is about to witness anything but a Hollywood mainstream thriller.The story revolves around Susan (Amy Adams) who is a successful but depressed gallery owner and lives unhappily with her second husband in a huge and very lonely mansion. One night her first husband Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal) whom she married when they were in college sends her the manuscript of a book he wrote called 'Nocturnal Animals'. The passages she reads are transformed into visual scenes that make up a story within the story. Automatically you try to spot parallels and connections between her life and the story of the book. But Tom Ford complicates things further by implementing a third story line that consists of memories of Susan and Edward's relationship that ended quite harshly. The film freely jumps from one branch to another and creates a veritable maze for the viewer in which it is a joy to get lost. Once you think you have figured out where all of this is going, you are confronted with a scene that seems to be completely at odds with everything you have seen before. 'Nocturnal Animals' thereby leaves room for many different interpretations, which is refreshingly in contrast to Hollywood's overkill of exposition and the compulsive urge to resolve every little bit by the end. Fittingly, the film ends on a very ambiguous note where the biggest twist is that there is no twist that smoothly fills the gaps and ties all three story lines together. It is however not chaotic but very well thought through. You can distil a single consistent story from the film, but nine other people will probably come up with nine different versions. Therefore, I urge you not to go see 'Nocturnal Animals' by yourself. Whether you like it or not, you will want to talk about this film. A lot. Just as Susan is haunted by her ex-husband's manuscript, this film sticks with you for a long time. Apart from the beautiful contrasts in visuals between the cold, bleak reality of Susan's current life, the Coenesque Neo-Western grittiness of the fictional story of the book and the dreamy atmosphere of the memory sequences as well as the challenging and complex script (an undeservingloss at the Golden Globes that hopefully will be corrected by the Academy), the icing on the cake are the brilliant performances by Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal. The former just rounds up her perfect year by neatly distinguishing this tortured woman from Arrival's Louise by distancing the audience at first but then drawing it in with every second the film progresses. Gyllenhaal on the other hand simply continues his almost flawless run of the past years by showing off his extraordinary capabilities as an actor whether his character is trying to remain calm while being obviously terrified, buzzing with joy when he falls in love with Susan or expresses ultimately raw rage where he seems to be about to break out of the screen. To this the film adds a strong supporting cast including Aaron Taylor-Johnson (at least the Golden Globes got that right), Michael Shannon, Laura Linney and the always welcomed Jena Malone who are all on top of their game here.'Nocturnal Animals' is a highly emotional ride that is equally structurally compelling as it is relatable on a personal level. It is something like a Rubrick's cube of a film that you put together differently every time but never get completely straight. And that's exactly why it is so fascinating to watch."
" Did I Miss Something?
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,7,"I don't understand all the negative reviews. I think the movie had an interesting concept, I enjoyed the acting and the set design, lighting, etc. I enjoyed the suspense of the novel as we went along with Amy Adam's character, but somehow the movie left me cold and hanging in the end. I guess I would have liked closure, but life is not like that. The novel within the movie kept me on the edge of my seat, great sound and music. Amy's character seemed so lost and desperately reaching out paralleling the Main character in the Novel, but like him, she ended alone cold and 'dead' in her own way. I enjoyed the ride, however but I felt empty in the end. Perhaps that was the goal of the director. Well told, well acted and held one's attention to the end...or at least mine!"
" Waste of great talent
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,2,"I know it is a far stretch but I will compare this movie to Blowup since you don't really have a story line in either movie. But while Blowup was a stylish cult movie, Nocturnal Animals is not. And I really don't have to have a story line that is logical or a linear plot-line for in order to enjoy a movie, that's why I like directors like Lynch or van Trier, but there is nothing here. Also: the plot in Blowup relies entirely on one character brilliantly portrayed by the then nearly unknown D. Hemmings, while in Nocturnal Animals you have three absolutely brilliant actors and neither of them can save the movie. If it wouldn't have been for Michael Shannon, I would have quit watching. And thus I finished to the bitter end without any reward or satisfaction. Heck, if you would ask me what the movie was about, I couldn't tell you; I think the Amy Adams character was dreaming while reading a book, but I'm not sure. This movie appeared to be directed by a computer using algorithms."
" It's some kind of pretentious, boring, abstract, wannabe avant-garde neo-noir shitty movie.
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,1,"I thought that the plot would somehow advance or have a twist or something... but much to my utter disappointment it just dragged on and on and on. If you don't like pretentious movies, don't even think about watching this one. It's some kind of abstract wannabe avant-garde neo-noir shitty movie. Some ""prolific Authors"" described it as disturbing and twisted- so I was all excited. (I love a good twist) But my God, it was tedious. It doesn't even have enough meat in it for me to properly criticize it. No wonder IMDb has such a good rating for this movie: everybody who saw it and didn't like it probably tried to write a comment, but gave up in line number 5. Having to write ten lines minimum about a movie in which nothing happens is a giant task."
" Could have been good
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,5,"This movie felt like it had a lot of potential to go somewhere, but it simply never did. I was really excited to see this movie - I live in France now and there are a limited number of movies in English at the local theater, so I drove an hour to the larger theater to see it. What a waste of four hours!I did understand the point the movie was trying to make, I just didn't feel like it made the point well. Judging by the very loud expressions of disgust at the end of the movie, many of the French felt the same way.Having a ""book within a movie"" is an interesting concept, but that portion of the movie was a made-for-TV quality movie at best. I normally enjoy cerebral, thought-provoking movies, but I would never recommend this movie. I'm surprised at the high rating."
" There's little to admire in this wash
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,3,"I wanted to love ""Nocturnal Animals,"" Tom Ford's long-awaited return to the director's chair following his artistic achievement with 2009's ""A Single Man."" The beauty is here, and Animals is certainly a gorgeous film to watch. The look is right, and the score is lush. It's a shame that for all the individual accomplishments such efforts add up to become such a thorough snoozefest.I would describe the plot, introduce the characters, etc., although for the most part all I can gather is that the movie is about Amy Adams reading a book with great intensity. The book itself, of course titled ""Nocturnal Animals,"" is a murder mystery written by her estranged ex-husband (Jake Gyllenhaal). Written as a manuscript on the verge of publication, Adams (her character is named Susan) reads the book in the bathtub, on the couch, in front of a fire, in her bed, etc. The emotions it draws out of her cause many reactions of shock, of horror, as she continually has to pause mid-sentence to let out a sigh and remove her glasses. This continues for the majority of the film. What a chore it is to be a wealthy woman reading a book. When she isn't reading, she is a failing artist whose most recent gallery featured life-like statues of obese women in the nude. Speaking of which, the opening credits to this film are quite an eyeful.The novel itself follows a man (again portrayed by Gyllenhaal) who gets pulled over on a lonely Texas highway by a group of men who are anything but friendly. In a scene of building tension, they are kidnapped and unspeakable circumstances befall the man, who gets involved with the law in attempts to track down the criminals. He works with a sheriff, played so aptly by Michael Shannon, who works outside of the law to save the day in the end. If it weren't such a travesty of a movie I would bet money that Shannon had a likely chance of receiving a Supporting Actor nomination at the upcoming Oscars. He's that good.At the conclusion of the novel, after Adams has run out of breath to sigh and warm baths to take, she contacts her ex in hopes of meeting him to discuss the book. So leads to an ending that is just as contrived as the rest of the film. It's a level of pretentiousness that I could sense with ""A Single Man"" and still admired for it's boldness. Here, in a story that precariously balances 2 or 3 stories simultaneously, it's a traffic jam of tone and theme. I can understand how there are interpretations to be made about the book, it's metaphors in regards to murder and abortion (there's a lot of plot I have failed to cover), revenge and healing. I don't blame Tom Ford entirely for the film being so convoluted, however when you see that he wrote, produced, and directed the picture, we have to draw the line somewhere, don't we?"
" Breathtaking and unsatisfying
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,9,"This is definitely not your everyday thriller. The story grabs you withing the first few minutes and does not let you go till the very end where you will be mad that it doesn't give you a kind of finish you were hoping for, or does it? I kind of hated the end... or is it what the movie needed, to be what it is? It is really hard to put in words what the movie did to me, at points I was so taken by it that the little breaks back to reality where Amy Adams reads the script gave me a few seconds to breath again before she continues! The acting was great and it its the first great Movie I have seen in quite some time.. def worth a watch!!!"
" another tom ford winner
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,7,"i thought it was a very well organized movie.although when the plot of the book starts i was afraid i would see just another violent meaningless thriller.but then the parallel stories begin and the movie started having interest.OK i have to say this guy caught in this situation one ugly truth is you wish he had a couple of guns with him in the car.the ONE really interesting truth for me in the movie is the metaphor of the death of his wife and daughter in the book. because he thinks he acted ""weak"".in reality his wife left him and because of this she ""killed"" his child.so no wife no child.this parallel of abortion and a shocking murder is for me the most dynamic realization of the movie.the rest can have so many interpretations,as many are commenting.him about being terminally ill for instance or to all so many reasons why he did not show up in the end.but for me this is irrelevant.in any case it is a movie that has a couple things to tell you and makes you think.also , i have to say the female character of the protagonist ,susan,is very well written and very well,sensitively directed my tom ford."
" Style points don't cut it.
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,1,"Looking for a good time at the movies, this isn't it. Be warned, there is head scratching right from the bizarre opening credits.The story within the story is an interesting concept but neither of the stories are compelling. The revenge violence story is hard to watch. The reading of the story and tossing the manuscript sums things up. The most watchable segments are the flashbacks of the early relationship. Nearly every scene seems to long. There are too many shots of the leads staring in contemplation. There are fades to black that last too long. Too much time is spent cleansing in the shower or tub. The best performance is highlighted by smoking, coughing and spitting. The contemporary scenes are high styled to distraction. The gallery workers attire is laughable. The ""Revenge"" painting is ridiculously unsubtle. Perhaps the real revenge is asking the ex to read the rape and murder story.There is no reason to spend time with these characters. If you are the kind that slows down at freeway crashes maybe there is a reason to glance at this movie. Most people should look the other way and avoid this dark nasty tale."
" A movie made for actors and the acting is amazing, but the movie itself seemed to try way to hard and it hurt itself.
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,7,"""When you love someone you have to be careful with it."" Susan Morrow (Adams) is a high end art gallery owner who is struggling with her life. Outwardly she has everything, but internally she is empty. When she receives a manuscript from her ex-husband Tony (Gyllenhaal) she notices something strange. Now the line between fiction and reality is blurred and Susan isn't sure what to think about what she is reading. This is a difficult movie to review. On one hand the movie is very tense and emotional with a very dark story to it which makes it hard to watch. On the other hand the acting is so great that it makes you want to keep watching just so you can experience what you are seeing. The movie itself seems to be all over the place though and really tries a little too hard to be important and send a message. It's a movie that tries to be an art-house picture but ends up being a little too pretentious which hurt it a little as well. All that said, the movie is decent and worth watching, but a little too slow and disturbing for me to fully say it's a must see. Overall, a movie made for actors and the acting is amazing, but the movie itself seemed to try way to hard and it hurt itself. I give this a B."
" A very artistic story
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,8,"Tom Ford is a fashion designer (not a secret), so when he makes movies he makes a wonderful combination of them. The opening of the film is beautiful. It is really noticeable how much effort he put in each scene, you can see the development of the characters through the movie. the cinematography was spectacular, it matches with the screenplay (loved that). Talking about screenplay, once the movie finishes the idea that I had is gone, now I start to question the whole story, who is real, who isn't, what is real, what isn't. I believe is really worth to watch this movie, and everyone has different conclusions. I believe Jake Gyllenhaal performances was amazing, he is a little crazy, then loving, caring, insecure, joyful. So that much versatility is one character was amazing. My favorite was the male performances, Gyllenhaal, Shannon, Taylor-Johnson, the three of them made a spectacular job."
" An analysis of personal expression and self-actualization
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,8,"When the movie ended, I knew that it would gather polarizing reactions, and that people would hate it just as much as I loved it, and, in a way, this is a perfect reflection of what I felt was the message of this movie. Some will see the story of a petty revenge, some will see the analysis of weakness, and what I saw in it was the depiction of what art and creation is about. Edward's novel, as we pick up along the clues left by ford in the movie, is the metaphorical expression of how he felt when she left him and aborted his child. For him, what she did equated to the rapt, rape and murder. Harrowing, heartbreaking, devastating, this is how he felt. But beyond Edward's words, there is Susan's interpretation of it. She is the one who pictures Tony (the ""weak"" one) with Edward's face, but in the end, isn't Susan the weak one? The one who didn't fight for the relationship and let it die (to conform to her mother's expectations?) What I loved about Nocturnal animals is that you can think about any of the novel's character and see who or what Edward was metaphorically expressing through them, like Bobby Andes, the relentless sheriff with cancer and nothing to lose, Ray, the epitome of vileness and disgust, his acolytes... Nothing is left and said in this movie for fluff, everything exists for a reason. Tom Ford manipulates with brio the 3 timelines and goes back and forth effortlessly, never losing the viewer, and adds to it a fantastic cinematography. The movie cast is one of the major assets of the movie, with an understated but efficient Amy Adams and an emotionally heartbreaking Jake Gyllehaal. But if the 2 leads are good, the supporting cast is even better: Michael Shannon is scene stealing, and Aaron Taylor- Johnson blew me away with a performance I thought he didn't have in him. However, and just as with Edward's book, this movie will not touch everyone the same way. I can see why some will love it and some hate it, but for me it was a hit."
" Like a puzzle missing the most important piece
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,6,"Leaving the cinema I was missing the emotional punch I should have felt if the film was supposed to touch me on a level deeper that my intellect. The latter, the intellect, was all satisfied analyzing the story and the filmmakers formal choices. The set up of a story within a story to explore the interrelations between reality and fiction and their various modes of identification and projection processes was well done. It is a complex narration, but narrated in a way that makes it easy to follow, supported by a clear visual codification. Take for example in the inter cutting sequences binding the books' and the films' reality together: we see Jake Gylenhaal all in hot, red colors and Amy Adams all filtered in blue. The film is full of sharp contrasts like this, giving it a strong expressionistic look and feel. It is moreover performed by a brilliant cast. Especially Michael Shannons' talent is shining quite bright here.But still: I wasn't emotionally moved at all, so, for me, NOCTURNAL ANIMALS is like a puzzle missing the most important piece."
" Dark and open to interpretation
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,8,"""Nocturnal animals"" is quite a thrilling movie. It is as quite as dark as anyone would expect and seems to me quite deep and complex. The main features of the film are the allegories and parallels between the ""real world"" and the ""novel"". Or, at least, how Susan perceives those parallels, given her current state. Even though she is successful at her job, she's is in an unhappy marriage, her husband cheats on her, she's taking drugs, losing interest in her work and sleepless. Quite fragile, if not on the verge of ""cracking"". She parallels the story with their relationship. She instantly depicts Tony as Edward. He is weak, he cant defend himself, he cant defend his family. Her aborted child is Tony's daughter. She probably thinks all Edward wants is revenge, just like Tony. The novel is a ""take that! how you like me now? I made it, i wrote a novel about myself and got published"". That is why she notices the ""REVENGE"" poster, because she's cynical, as she says. However, I don't think that's all. Tony wants revenge at first, but he can't pull the trigger. Because he realizes that revenge won't bring back his family. I think that this is Edward's state now. He wanted revenge from Susan when he started writing the novel. But he doesn't need it anymore. He got hurt deeply, yes. But by the end of it he has gotten over the breakup. Revenge is like Bobby's cancer, killing him from the inside. I think that this is his message. I'm over you, i hope you're over our marriage, too. There is also something else, that puts things under a different perspective. When Tony walks out of the trailer, one of his eyes is shut, covered in blood. Just like Susan's eye is always covered by her hair. And he clutches his cross in his dying moments, just like Susan does quite a lot often. What if Tony's ""real"" parallel is Susan, not Edward? What if she is the weak one? What if she's the one yelling ""I should have stopped it""? Meaning she shouldn't walk away from their relationship. Based on what we know she's in an unhappy marriage and an unhappy position overall. We don't know almost anything about Edward's state. The way I see it she is regretful. She reminisces of that time of her life, and maybe wonders ""what if i had done things differently?"". ""When you love someone you have to be careful with it, you might never get it again"", is what he had told her. ""Passion doesn't last forever"", is what Carlos' wife said. And I think that Susan ultimately understands all these. She probably hadn't when she sent that e-mail to Edward. But she does in the end. It doesn't matter why he never appeared, whether it's another (or the actual) act of revenge or just because he is too busy with his own life that he forgot their rendezvous. For her, it's the ultimate hit. It's the gunshot in the stomach. I presume she had high hopes, as she took off her wedding ring. But she's left distraught. She feels the pain she caused. So, from now on, she either gets over it, moves on and starts a new life from the beginning, or, she ends it at all."
" one of the worst films, ever.
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,1,"How anyone can elevate this rubbish above the worth of a used genital catheter is beyond my comprehension. Hard to know where to start as it deserves nothing less. I can only assume that the awards people are on acid or just landed from an orbiting star. Tom Ford seriusly needs to stick to designing frocks and spend less time on what can only be heralded as some epic navel gazing. The only film I can think of that comes close to regurgitating such utter, self- indulgent spunk is The Danish Girl. Both directors could do well to go back to wherever it was they thought they found their 'calling' and pull their idiotic heads out of their collective rectums. Perhaps the judges of the Globes etc should stop worrying about who's watching their every move and concentrate on the ancient and almost extinct, it seems, art of storytelling...? Just a thought."
" Tom Ford is a genius
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,9,"This visually stunning masterpiece tells the story of writer Edward and his ex-wife Susan. Long after their breakup, when she's already remarried, he sends her his latest manuscript. She gets overwhelmed by the story, which is not surprising, since the book is hauntingly gruesome.And so, we see two main story lines unfold - Susan's life and the plot of the book. Interestingly enough, we never see ""present day""- Edward, we only see him in flashbacks and as his character, Tony.I went to see this movie only because Tom Ford made it - and that reason was good enough; I was not disappointed in the slightest.The whole thing starts of with a sort of grotesque art exhibition consisting of overweight women flapping their bare, excessive skin on screen. In their knee-high, white hooker shoes they seem to be dancing to a different song than the audience hears but it's quite an interesting look. What was most striking to me was the honesty of the visual; the women weren't edited. They just flapped their flaps as they were and they weren't at all terrible to look at.Tom Ford shows physicality in general in a very peculiar way. In any scene with naked bodies in this movie they seem unedited and in the case of Susan and her daughter India, their bodies are just terrific. Which is weird because we see them naked only when they're dead.The bodies are nothing compared to the landscape images though. It's worth seeing Nocturnal Animals for the incredible landscape shots alone. Especially the clouds, the desert, the rich colours, everything.The shots in general were quite unique. Wide shots, with little movement, or movement of the actors that wasn't front and center. Or really tight close-ups, which reminded me of the 40's for some reason. Then, suddenly quick shots, matched to the speed of a beating heart.Tom Ford is a genius.Oh well, there was one unnecessary, unexplained jump scare that I would've just edited out but that's fine.Another thing I really liked about the design of the film was how the jumps in time were introduced - because they weren't. The images just naturally shaped into either present day, book time and flashbacks. There was no need for superimposed text that would inform us that we went back in time.One major thing I didn't enjoy though (but this might be a thing I don't enjoy in general in movies) was the open ending. Susan and Edward were supposed to meet and he didn't show. Even though he insisted on the meeting! Was this just some weak revenge? Or did he show up in the end? Or did he kill himself? Or what's going on there? I know some people like leaving the cinema thinking what would happen next but I guess I'm not one of them.But all is forgiven thanks to one scene in the movie. Basically, young Susan and Edward are on a spontaneous date. Edward is clean- shaven, sharply dressed and Susan looks dreamy in her side-swept hair and undeniably perfect face. The best thing about this scene in my view is Jake Gyllenhaal's acting. He dominated that scene. And man, was he charming. I mean, literally, charming, fall-on-your- knees-in-love-charming. I couldn't believe my eyes. I think he's a great actor but I didn't know he could pull something like this off. I think even if somebody didn't like him they would be just as floored as me by his performance. It was the epitome of what mainstream pop culture presents as romantic.In conclusion, this is a strong, incredibly well-designed movie, definitely worth seeing, even if the plot itself isn't your thing. There are some flaws in my view but as a whole it's quite terrific. I hope Tom Ford will keep up his unique style of creating art in movie form."
" Amateurish stilted disjointed mess made by first-year film-school student
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,1,"Tom Ford clearly has grown as an artistE. He used OTHER designer retro- framed glasses in his movie. WOW! Within first 15 minutes movie looks like pretty models reading que cards. The more pretty models come in with irrelevant stilted dialogue. Tom Ford apparently thinks that people talk as if giving Google cliff- notes to each other: ""I was married once , he is my ex-husband he wrote a novel I left him , I am horrible person"" this is pretty much first dialogue in the movie. If you can call it dialogue, then it goes down from there. I felt uncomfortable at times the movie was so bad, watches as some TV drama made on a shoestring budget. His first film was nothing special, but at least it was a film. This exercise is just so much worse I think he should concentrate on imitating YSL and leave the cinema to artists."
" The worst film I've seen in quote some time...
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,1,"As Tom Hanks' character in Big would say: ""I don't get it"". Why anyone is talking about this film in terms of awards flummoxes me.This awful film wasn't helped by the marketing blurb that made it sound like it was a thriller in which the main female lead is worried about her ex plotting revenge. It was nothing of the sort. If she was even slightly worried I couldn't tell. I guess him sending her his awful book was revenge enough in itself.The scenes in which the dreary woman moped about reading the book just made the film longer and increasingly dull. Maybe they were supposed to be art masquerading as cinematography? The best bits were the dramatization of the book. Tom Ford might learn some useful lessons by watching some of Peter Greenaway's films.There was an excess of style of substance. What was the point of the corpulent women at the start? Or the nonsense in the pseudo-art gallery? This film was made by an aspiring artist - but not a storyteller. It was completely unsatisfying and I loathed it. If I had gone to the cinema on my own I would have walked out - it was that bad. It's a pity I can't award zero stars."
" One of the best films of 2016.
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,9,"Nocturnal Animals is incredible, I admit that I did not expect the film to have this quality, now I wonder how it was not indicated to the golden globe? The cast is very good, Amy Adams acts in one more film a year, and she is very well, Jake Gyllenhaal is great, Michael Shannon is great too, was my favorite in the movie, Aaron Taylor- Johnson is great, and the rest Of the cast is very competent, the plot of the film is not told linearly, has moments of the present and past, may even seem confusing, but it is even simple to understand, the best scenes are that Jake Gyllenhaal is with Shannon, has scenes Shocking and very heavy, the mood of the film is very somber, the direction of Tom Ford is great, he develops the characters very well, the script even with leaving some things confusing, is very good, the film reminded me of the Nightcrawler in some aspects , Nocturnal Animals is an excellent film, one of the best films of 2016, will attend, it looks like to compete in several nominations at the 2017 Oscar. Note 9.2"
" Ford's impressive debut into thrillers.
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,8,"As expected from Ford, this film is a sensory experience that will surely thrive the spectator that enjoys aesthetic stimulation. Nevertheless, this piece drives apart from ""A single Man"", being his debut and radical shift into the psychological thriller genre. Beautifully executed, this rather simple narration will immerse the audience into a subtle but strong and piercing story. The themes of fear, prejudice, regret, anxiety and revenge will come up out of a couple of characters.The main acting is certainly nothing special (Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhall), but the supporting actors are brilliant (Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson). Some say this film lacks of content what it exceeds of style. Just don't listen and go and watch for yourself this subtle, and overly beautiful film."
" A polished turd with few redeeming qualities...
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,4,"(Spoiler Free Review)This film was a huge disappointment.The only redeeming qualities were the trademark (at times) stunning visuals that Tom Ford is capable of. Credit where it's due, because the use of color and composition in most scenes, as well as most of the intense acting, were worthy of a much better film. Unfortunately, the film falls completely flat due to a boring, two- dimensional story with cardboard characters and mostly comically bad dialogue.While the film operates with a story within a story, the hilariously bad plot and over the top dialogue of both stories make this film the definition of ""a polished turd"". Yes, it may be nice to look at, but ultimately the visuals and mostly intense acting has only little effect on the viewer, because of the two boring and predictable plots (the story and the story within the actual story).Even worse, the director seems undecided on whether the film is supposed to be a drama, a thriller or just a mildly dark comedy: Scenes that are supposed to be intense fall mostly flat because of the absurdity of both the characters' actions as well as the ridiculous dialogue. While the movie does start with a few intense and welldirected scenes, the following scenes quickly become not just unnatural - they are pretty much B-movie standard with no depth at all. ""Less is more"" is quickly thrown away by the director and replaced with pieces of dialogue explaining everything to the viewer. Furthermore, scenes of supposed drama become nonsensical due to unnatural human behavior and weirdly convenient coincidences. Even further, at times small scenes seem to be just suddenly ""thrown into"" the film for no apparent reason than a visual peculiarity or a mildly funny joke. Overall, it is a film quite obviously created by a fashion designer: At times both actors' emotions and visuals reach striking heights, but everything falls flat due to a nonsensical story (and the almost as nonsensical story within that story) resulting in the viewer being left chuckling at the absurd lines, nonsensical plot and randomly included scenes. Avoid this at the cinema at all costs. Go to an art gallery in stead. The latter will have more depth than this posh and snobby excuse of a film..."
" Good but not that good
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,6,"I watched the movie right after Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Golden Globe winning, I was curious since I only saw him on Anna Karenina. Watched the trailer and I liked it, and since I enjoyed Tom Ford's A single man I thought it had a good chance to be good. Although it says ""Not a single Tom Ford product appears in the film, as Ford ""didn't want a commercial."""", most of it pretty much looks like a commercial for Channel, Gucci or some other designer, very easy on the eye (Amy Adams's life in particular) but with no essence whatsoever. For the story, I liked it, that's it, the one that the book written in the movie is telling, it was the best for me, it reminded me of some Flanney O'Connor stories. About the acting, with such good leading actors, I thought they didn't do their best job, specially Amy, or maybe her character was just boring, but I didn't believe that she was the art dealer living a miserable life, barely any lines, if you watch the trailer that's pretty much what she says throughout all the film. You could have even discarded the husband and the friends and it would have been the same thing. Jake Gylenhaal's character on the main story (the book) was powerful but again, I didn't think it was his best work. What really saved the movie was having Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Michael Shannon. They really gave life to it. Another thing it bothered me was that it looked that they didn't even try to make Amy Adams look young for the story happening 19 years earlier or older than her years for the story happening in present day. Overall, I believe like someone said it was a pretentious job, it could have been better but at the end it felt flat"
" A depressing and yet very realistic revenge story
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,9,"This is one of those films that will resonate with audiences that have deep understanding of it. People that has experienced, witnessed and went through heartbreaks. By pouring your effort and passion into someone before and was left with nothing. Except with just memories of the past and what you did together with that person. A lot of men are driven by ego and when that ego is stepped on, you want to prove your worth to that person or others that wasn't there for you when you needed them. In another words to prove a point to the people that let you down. That you can do what you set out to do without that person in your life. That is the main drive of this story, and it's told through metaphors through a book manuscript. So in a way it's a story within a story, one being real and the other being fiction but written in a way that shows the authors pain, anguish and anger. I will admit, if I saw this movie when I was still a teenager I would have thought it was a pretentious art film. But watching it now, I can't help it but think of it as a piercing art film.9/10"
" Fantastic, but you may don't get it!
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,9,"I liked Nocturnal Animals as most of Jake Gyllenhaal's movies. But, to enjoy this type of movies, you have to firstly believe in the genius director (Tom Ford) and that you're going to watch a movie for one of the best actors in Hollywood these days, or you may miss many extraordinary scenes! In another words, you have to watch carefully to get the moral of this movie. Nocturnal Animals isn't mind-bending like (Enemy) or (The Fountain), but it simply has big deals of ""symbolism"" and every symbol was put in it's place for a certain reason, and this is exactly what makes me think about Nocturnal Animals as a piece of art. Also, the acting skills of Amy, Jake, Micheal and Aron were really outstanding! I loved many details in every character. The one and only negative point about Nocturnal Animals is that the novel written and sent by (Edward) missed the reality in some parts. There are some skipped details that would make me don't like it if I was reading it as a single novel away from the movie. However, It described the life of (Edward) and (Susan) in a genius way DON'T MISS THIS MASTERPIECE!"
" A Masterpiece!
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,10,"Nocturnal Animals is a masterpiece! Tom Ford creates a suspenseful, thriller type atmosphere that will keep you to the edge of your seats. Amy Adams is spectacular in every sense of the word. Jake Gyllenhaal dazzles with perfection that will have him looking at an Oscar nomination for his role. Tom Ford work and effort in this film is astonishing in every single detail put in this film.The screenplay and overall theme of this film is perfect! The ending of the film leaves audience members to reflect upon our decision making and the choices we choose to make in life and how that will cost us in the end. The conclusion to this nerve-shredding film is filled with twists that no one will see coming.This film will leave you emotional and terrified as it teaches a valuable lesson that Ford attempts to address his viewers.**Overall, my rating for Nocturnal Animals is 10/10**"
" What a treat! FANTASTIC Dark Thriller!
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,10,"Wow, I am speechless, just came back from the cinema. LOVED THE MOVIE!First of all, the movie is beautifully displayed. I enjoyed every shot of it, Tom Ford did a great job there, every scene is perfectly built. Secondly, the acting! The movie is slow paced and has not too much conversation, but it doesn't need it with all this spectacular acting. This is one of the best performances I have seen from Jack Gyllenhaal, he puts so much depth and emotion to his character. The Cop, Michael Shannon plays terrific as always. But for me the real star was the villain. Kickass Actor Aaron Taylor acts fantastic, his mimic's, the way he makes noises with his mouth to further enhance his point in conversations, just perfection to me. Thirdly, it is extremely thrilling and you are on the edge of your seats on many occasions, hoping for the good. Watch this movie if you enjoy a slow, but THRILLING, very dark, very brutal (not gory, but psychologically violent) Texas Thriller.Cheers mates!"
" I don't want to read that book, I want to watch the couple and see how does the things get to this point?
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,1,"Nocturnal Animals is a distant and pointless effort. There is nothing to thrill you or make you think. The first layer is somehow cold. It doesn't grab your attention. The audience cannot have a connection with the characters and the atmosphere and the second layer is pointless, because the book which is also the name of the film is revived on screen, but since it is fiction within fiction, you don't care about the characters and the events happen to them. The first layer tries to be a criticism of society or upper class, but it fails too short. It just throws us just a bunch of glimpses and there is nothing dark, sexy or smart in this tale! I wanted the movie to dig down expectations, roles and dynamics in human relationships and a criticism of modern society, but the film doesn't prefer to deal with these themes generally. In fact, I'd expected a movie like ""Sleeping with Enemy"", ""Mortal Thoughts"" or ""Diabolique"", but this movie is just an insult to the viewer, because instead of the promises of the plot, we rather watch a crime thriller in a modern Western atmosphere! That story is gripping, little suspenseful and intense thanks to the cinematography, a great Michael Shannon and an amazing Aaron Taylor-Johnson as his best acting yet. However, the movie tries to be nightmarish, but it falls too short. I love all type of Western movies and neo-noir type of films, but this was supposed to be a dark ""relationship"" movie with cynicism, so if you expect a dark relationship movie or a bitter revenge movie, you will be seriously disappointed. I like Amy Adams, but since she is in almost every movie, I have no more attraction or excitement for this beautiful lady. Jake Gylenhaal gave one of the greatest male performances of all time in ""Nightcrawler"", but he is not that great or unforgettable in this movie. Honestly, Mr. Shannon steals the whole show and he was my favorite character in this movie though! A few flashbacks, a boring opening sequence and an abrupt ending turn this movie into a big missed opportunity. Especially, after seeing that ending, I asked to myself, ""so what?"" I think that this movie deserves a shocking ending or at least an unforgettable one, but it just doesn't deliver its message. However, the movie has a hilarious opening credits which is maybe the only thing that has a meaning! I didn't buy all those metaphors between the two parallel stories in the movie. If you watch a real revenge movie, watch a few Korean films or In The Bedroom."
" First world problems
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,4,"A reasonably well intentioned effort by Tom Ford quickly trips over its own laces as whingey whiny first world problem after first world problem leads the viewer to care not a jot about anyone of the characters in this film; whether they be in the 'real' story or in the parallel 'fictional' one.If I were to find anything praiseworthy about the film at all, it's the presence of Michael Shannon who dominates the screen wherever he appears. Actually, in my opinion, had he been chosen to play the fictional character of Tony, the story would have had more clout instead of watching plastic haired Jake Gyllenhaal pouting and feigning interest in a story he seems not to care much about either.I found the cinematography flat and lifeless and the main purpose of this film appears to be to promote the (purportedly) beautiful interior spaces inhabited by the 'art-irati' and their vanity eyewear. In short, had this film been named 'Nocturnal Interiors', it would have had more of a focus to it.All in all, a poor effort of a film. 4/10"
" Don't Believe the Hype
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,2,"Acting: depressingly awful despite amazing actors Writing/Dialogue: so clichéd, so pretentious, so stiff, and zero weight Cinematography: nice Colors: nice Story: who cares about some wealthy, pretentious idiot who's tragic and beautiful with forced symbolism. Nobody. Maybe I have a brain tumor, but I can't believe I've seen the same movie as everything else. This is one of the worst I've ever seen. It's stylish and vapid, a movie made for wealthy, wannabe-artists by a wealthy, bored, and arrogant man. You don't care about the story or the characters, everything is so predictable and stale (despite the """"""SYMBOLIC"""""" shots and editing). It took less than 15 minutes for me to bail, which I did, multiple times. The rest of it I sat through laughing and cringing in secondhand embarrassment. Line delivery was terrible, the dialogue was shockingly stupid- like the story's direction, you always know what the characters will say and feel 5 minutes ahead; the WORST CASE of ""telling, and not showing"" is present in literally every aspect of the movie. Tom Ford rams every 'symbol"" and embarrassingly preachy statement about modern society down your throat, and you sit there, bored and repeating, ""I GET IT, I GET IT DUDE"" into your hands whenever Amy Adams takes a shower. It's meaningless and over hyped."
" Tom Ford should staying making jeans, not films
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,1,"A portrayal of revenge.Nocturnal Animals is about a book. This book is written by Edward Sheffield. In the novel a man was on the road with wife and daughter and they was haunted by a crazy guys who kidnap the two women. Tony Hastings want to find the gang members and he find help with sheriff Bobby Andes.Amy Adams plays Susan Morrow,a rich woman who hates her mother Anne(Laura Linney) and finally ends becoming her mother dumping his husband Edward for a richest man (and a cheater playboy).The violent scenes are silly, Edward looks helpless and stupid and couldn't defend Laura and India from the rapist gang and that's makes you feel helpless as well, the movie jumps back and forth about Edward and Susan past, and mixing the man in the book and the story is a whole mess. The atmosphere is gloomy and half lighted, and I applause that, but the end is horrible."
" Tom Ford should probably stick to the runway...
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,3,"If the reviews in this film hadn't been so high I wouldn't have even bothered watching, the beginning started out very strongly albeit very depressing, it had potential. Mid movie until the ending was very underwhelming and the ending was a total bomb, there was a lot left unexplained and it seems to me that there are better ways to get revenge on someone than simply standing them up for dinner. Michael Shannon was the only reason I watched until the end, he never disappoints although a normally very entertaining Jake Gyllenhaal fell horribly short. In my opinion Tom Ford should probably stick to what he knows and leave the movies to the actual directors."
" It was dark, but it was beautiful
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,8,"I must say that i liked the movie It was one of those movies that you watch and then you think about it for days or even weeks and you find out something new each time you bring it to your mind, and that exact aspect of the cinema i love. Also it was a good movie, with great actors, they could drag you in their harsh world, it had feelings, all kinds of them, during the movie you could feel the suspense and the anxiety but you could also feel sadness and pity and hope ( don't mistake it it wasn't a hopeful movie at all). About the director i must admit that i wasn't very positive on the film because of him, but i was surprised, he was able to take a scenario and get it to the screen creating suspense but also giving out the contrast between the characters and the similarities between them in a way that made you feel that they were the same person but in the same time they belonged to different worlds. the thing i loved the most though was its darkness, it was the directors way to show all the problems of the modern world not in a social movie but in a thriller and that on its own is a miracle, it was harsh and abrupt and at many points i felt i didn't want to see but i couldn't stop watching. It kind of reminded me an ancient Greek tragedy, it gave you an ethical problem(how to ensure justice) and through pain and fear it led you to redemption, not revenge as many wanted to see but redemption, and in the end as every ancient Greek tragedy it didn't had a happy end, as once again many wanted. On the negative parts, the movie let me wondering about aspects of the characters, who were they and stuff. Also there was a sub- plot no one cared about. I understand the director did it to slow down the movie but he could have done a better job there and lastly the end was a bit sloppy and fast contrary to the rest of the movie. In the end it just felt like he run out of time and he closed it up really fast. On the whole if you want to watch that movie you must be prepared that it is going to be hard on you, and in the end you will have many questions unanswered that you will need to think for yourself which is exactly the beauty of the film. If you are not into that kind of movies just don't watch it, no point there"
" slick vs dusty
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,8,"Greetings again from the darkness. First rule of Write Club  ABC. Always Bring Conflict. Alright, so I blended famous lines from a couple of movies there, but the point is a good script inevitably has conflict throughout. Director Tom Ford (A Single Man, 2009) adapted the screenplay from Austin Wright's novel ""Tony and Susan"", and while significant conflicts abound, it's the multiple and vivid contrasts that take this one to the next level.Director Ford jolts us with one of the most unique and unwelcome opening scenes ever as the credits flash by. A high gloss art gallery is the setting for a combination of video/performance art taking place that could only be appreciated by those with very specific tastes  those who favor obese naked dancing ladies. Extremely obese and absolutely naked. It's not the last time we as viewers will be uncomfortable, but it is the last time we will chuckle (even if it is awkwardly).The curator of the art gallery is Susan, played by Amy Adams. She lives in a stunning, ultra-contemporary mansion with her picturesque husband played by Armie Hammer. Their relationship is apparently as cold as his business, resulting in an empty relationship and the need to maintain the façade with their friends while quietly selling off assets to buy time. On the day that he leaves on a ""business trip"", she receives a package containing a galley of her ex-husband Edward's (Jake Gyllenhaal) first novel  some interesting reading during her time alone.A creative story structure has Susan reading the book (dedicated to her) in bed while we ""see"" what she's reading/envisioning. The story starts out as just another road trip for a husband (Gyllenhaal in a dual role), wife (Isla Fisher) and their teenage daughter (Ellie Bamber). However, on the desolate back roads of west Texas things get intense - almost unbearably so. The young family is terrorized by a trio of rednecks led by sociopath Ray Marcus (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson in what is head and shoulders above anything he's done to date). What follows is the fear of every man  unable to protect his family, and every woman  being abducted.Thanks to flashbacks and some simple inferences, we soon realize the novel is corresponding to Susan and Edward's past relationship, as well as Susan's current situation. The previously mentioned contrasts really kick into gear. It's the past versus the present, west Texas tumbleweeds versus the sleek and glamorous art world, Susan's first artsy husband versus her new ideal one, young Susan versus current Susan, the physical beauty of those in Susan's world versus the grit and ugliness of the novel, and finally, reality vs what's not real.The revenge-thriller portion of the novel makes for fascinating story-telling, and we get drawn in fully once Michael Shannon (playing a west Texas detective) arrives on the screen. Always one to disappear into his role, this may be Mr. Shannon's best yet. Though he doesn't have significant screen time, we are mesmerized by him during his scenes. He and Gyllenhaal are terrific together. Also appearing in supporting roles are Michael Sheen, Andrea Riseborough, Jena Malone, and a chilling scene from Laura Linney as Susan's high society mother.The two parts of the film play off each other like Brian DePalma against Sergio Leone. Slick against dusty  but of course, there is misery and disappointment and deceit in each. The cinematography (2 time Oscar nominee Seamus McGarvey) and editing (Joan Sobel) are superb and complemented by a spot on score from composer Abel Korzeniowski (a mixture of Bernard Hermann and Basic Instinct). The ending may frustrate some (not me) and though it may not find a huge audience, a loyal fan base is quite likely."
" A movie requires more than one decent metaphor to hold its own for 2 hours.
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,4,"I agree with a lot of people here who say this movie is undoubtedly one of the best looking movies of the year. It's probably no surprise coming from a director like Tom Ford, who was a fashion designer for Gucci before chasing filmmaking. This movie looks like a Gucci ad for the majority of its runtime and it's hard to fault him for having an impeccable attention to detail. Whether it's a closeup of Amy Adams' face or a wide shot of a deserted landscape, Ford certainly has a hell of an eye for a shot.It's too bad that that's all there is to this movie. If this film were made by a less talented director, it would probably be a Lifetime Channel movie, and for most of the duration it feels like one; one artfully directed Lifetime Channel movie with masterful acting, but even still, Lifetime-tier. It's a shame that such a talented cast couldn't help elevate this film above its mediocre script. There are some deviations from the norm, like the main character being rich and being the owner of an art gallery she doesn't care for (which I'll admit I found to be an interesting dynamic), rich and still having a good relationship with her ex husband (ish), there's a few more but that's the few I can name off the top of my head.Lots of people are claiming that this film is one complex masterpiece or whatever, but they couldn't be more wrong if they tried. The whole film is a metaphor for how awful divorce is, and problem is, it's so easy to tell, and it's all the movie has to exist on aside from a good performance from Amy Adams. It's clear from the fact that Jake Gyllenhaal plays both Edward (the ex husband) and Tony. Hell, the original book this film is based on is called ""Tony and Susan"". Susan basically reads this graphic and violent metaphor for how apparently horrible she is and feels bad about it. The metaphor is only communicated through the movie-within-the-movie to the point where the movie's actual plot is literally just... Amy Adams reading a book for 2 hours and feeling bad. That is literally her whole character arc. She reads a book and she feels bad. There is literally a scene where she looks at a live video on a co-worker's iPhone only to see the character in the novel that is supposed to be her jump at the camera lens. It's about as subtle as a brick to the face.Not just that but the film handles how apparently horrible she is so callously. In the book, the plot is that Tony lost his family when a man and his deranged friend captured them and raped and killed them. So uh... what did she do to ""rape and kill"" whatever he had? Oh right, she had an abortion. Because heaven forbid a woman should choose whether or not she wants to keep a child from a man she's no longer with. And what happens after she gets the abortion? If you guessed ""she feels bad"", congratulations, feel free to take a cookie. Seriously, I'm no feminist advocate or whatever, but the treatment of women in this film is so callous it's beyond belief. We get it, divorce is tough. We don't need a violent perfume ad disguised as a movie to remind us of that.When all is said and done, Nocturnal Animals is basically just a pretty looking A-list student film that thinks it's more clever than it really is. If this didn't have a master of aesthetic directing it, it would basically have just ended up as the Lifetime Network movie of the week it probably should have been. It's not offensively bad, it's just gorgeous mediocrity and a weak metaphor carrying a movie on fumes. It's like a bag of chips that's 80% air passing itself off as a full meal."
" Instant Nocterpiece!!
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"The Ford Administration has delivered! Fashion icon turned filmmaker Tom Ford has fashioned an intoxicating, gripping thriller ""Nocturnal Animals"". This is unlike any movie you will see on the runway in 2016. It stars as Amy Adams as Art Gallery Owner Susan Morrow. Susan is married to adulterous husband Hutton played by Armie Hammer. Even though the Morrows live a wealth life, Susan's art gallery is having fiscal nightmares. A novel is sent to Susan entitled ""Nocturnal Animals""; written by her ex- husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) which she has not seen in nearly twenty years. Susan starts reading the novel, of course during the nocturnal time periods, and then the film incorporates the narrative of the novel within the intertwining stories structure of the picture; which revolves around a family of three's encounter with psychotic hoodlums. The film also shows flashback scenes of Edward and Susan's past relationship. I do not want to Noc you out with more plot details, because that would be an exercise in spoiler fatality. I do have to say that ""Nocturnal Animals"" is almost like three movies in one. Moreover, the various narratives within the picture invokes the viewers to put in their own symbolic interpretations and relationship analysis due to the profound ambiguity of the movie. Ford's direction and screenplay were phenomenal and much deserving of Oscar nominations. The cast was spectacular. Adams perfected the role of Susan. Gyllenhaal's double duty performance as Sheffield and the novel's main character Tony was a compound sensation. Aaron Taylor-Johnson was mad impressive as the novel's main sociopath antagonist Ray Marcus. Laura Linney just went to bat one time by being in just one scene, but knocked it out of the ball park as Susan's judgmental mother Anne. But what will really noc your socks out is Michael Shannon's pure-perfect performance as the dying investigative detective Bobby Andes. Andesleeee!! Give Shannon a Best Supporting Actor Oscar!! So bring the cinematic animal in you and step into the viewing cage of ""Nocturnal Animals"". ***** Excellent"
" Tom Ford should stick to what he knows: Fashion Design
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,2,"There won't be any spoilers in this review...I'm sorry but this movie is not very good. Tom Ford clearly does not know how to direct a movie. It was a convoluted mess from the onset. The script wasn't any better either. It didn't make sense and quite honestly, I didn't care for any of the characters. They were a bunch of annoying white rich people with no relatable problems. I think that the only reason Tom Ford got all these A-List actors to be in his movie is 'cos he knows them from his fashion designer days. Otherwise, this woulda easily been a B-movie with B-movie talent. The performances were good, but even a good performance can't save a shitty movie. The style of the movie was weird as well. It looked like a glossy 90's music video. The best thing about the movie, aside from it ending, was Michael Shannon who is good in everything.I would say skip this movie and spend the 2 1/2 hours of your life doing something else."
" Underrated
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,9,"Tom Fords first movie ""A Single Man"" was a big surprise for all movie lovers. With ""Nocturnal Animas"", there was many pressure for him. But he delivered, as I not expected to. Very good, unconventional and as far I saw the reviews, underrated movie. We all talk about Amy Adams this year, because of Arrival(great movie by the way), but for me Jake Gyllenhaal shines more. His Performance is remarkable and very important for him. The movies he picked lately were wrong choices. So I'm happy to see him in such a great movie again. Last but not least Michael Shannon. What i have to say? He is always in the right place in his roles. My Movie of the year! Please go see the movie. Its very important to watch those movies in the theater these days. These kind of movies need to be supported, too get an okay box-office."
" I got surprised!
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,9,"I'm not here to review the film but only to say how much I loved Michael Shannon's job in this movie. I used to escape any film he was cast in or just watched it kinda feeling forced if I were really in to that film. I don't know why but I always had this bad feeling toward him or maybe I just never liked his acting. Anyway, I went to watch this movie not knowing he was a part of it but my god he strongly surprised me! I very much liked every part he was playing! Jake Gyllenhaal does it every time in this kind of movie! from Prisoners, Nightcrawler and lately Demolition. He is great in all of them but in this movies Michael Shannons is just amazing and believe me! you are reading right. The story is amazing and it will move you. You'll be going home thinking about it all night and you might even have some unanswered questions. Jake and Amy are great as usual but the one thing that will surprise you IS Shannons performance."
" A thrilling masterpiece.
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"8/10. An art gallery owner is enthralled by her ex husbands novel, suddenly showing up. OMG, this is a true thriller, and is masterfully directed and acted. Tom Ford is a genius, he works his magic in this film, and gets into your head. You just don't know where he is taking you. Very impressive for his second film as a director. Amy Adams is impressive and plays her part well. But one of my favourite actors Jake Gyllenhaal is awesome, as he so often is. He also keeps you guessing as to what is actually going on. And let's not forget Michael Shannon's part as detective, creepy and fascinating at the same time. Now this movie will not be for everyone, you will either hate or love this film. I loved the ride and was really stumped by the ending, but it gets you thinking and from what I can tell there are a few different ways of interpreting the final act. If you like psychological thrillers then definitely check it out, it is somewhat a masterpiece. Nocturnal Animals #nocturnalanimals."
" Thrilling but with unrealistic important details
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,5,"While the story was thrilling and made me want to keep watching, there were many unrealistic details. I realize that most of them were in the book she was reading, but were still undermining our intelligence. I mean you could clearly see that the bad guys were NOT blocking their car. They could easily drive away. Even with a flat tire (which they didn't know they had yet anyway) they should try and escape since they were in danger. Then a police car drives by and it doesn't stop when in the dark of the night two cars with their lights on are at the side of the road and 2 women are running, screaming and waving their hands at it...right... Even at the end when the enraged protagonist is aiming at his wife's and daughter's killer, he closes his eyes for many agonizing seconds. For no reason. As if he is not aiming at a dangerous desperate man trying to flee. If we leave the book out, the whole story is about a shallow woman that was horrible to her ex husband and now regrets it because her younger new husband doesn't want her anymore and she is trapped in a pretentious job. That's it. I really liked the parallelism of her cruelty towards her husband, to the cruelty of the men in the book. That was food for thought."
" Wait, what?
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,5,"The beginning of this movie was interesting and had so much potential! A few thrilling redeemable aspects, mostly due to there being a seemingly random ass action/suspense story line within the story taking place in present time (I'm referring to the book she reads that she was given as a gift from her ex love out of the blue) Considering this story is basically the entire movie, I wouldn't say it was a COMPLETE waste of time. Need to make a note that the acting was GREAT, by the way. A few big names in this and they all played their role very well. It was a fun watch but ... Unfortunately, it didn't go anywhere. And instead, turned into this sad, confusing mess which had no conclusion, explanation or closed ends in any way, shape or form. Only a cut off ending that left me annoyed and depressed. It's one of those ""You decide EVERYTHING for yourself about this metaphor of a film"". If you do decide to watch it, just enjoy it in the moment for what it is. Don't expect anything to make sense."
" A riveting thriller with two interwoven stories.
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Nocturnal Animals tells two stories at the same time, one set in the real world, where the main protagonist (Susan) receives a book written by her ex-husband Edward (Jake Gylenhaall), and a second story which follows the story of the book. The real world story is told in parallel with the book, where it is interrupted by flashbacks of Susan's relationship with Edward. The story of the book itself is a tough one, with the main character getting assaulted by a group of three men while on the road with his wife and daughter. What unfolds afterwards sets up an intense story that could be viewed as a separate film. However, what I found riveting about this film is that both the real life story and the one in the book parallel each other very well. Since Edward incorporates elements of his relationship with Susan, we get a good sense of how he views their relationship. This adds a lot to the film, as a standalone story, the book (titled Nocturnal Animals), would be a very good revenge drama, however, interwoven with the real life story of Susan and Edward's relationship, we get a much deeper insight into Edward's mind, and then, looking back at the book's story, we can see how it creates a statement on the real world events. The ending of the movie ends on a very precise note, and while I say this subjectively, it does end at the perfect spot, with the perfect tone.I've tried to exclude spoilers as much as possible from this review, so my apologies if you find it superficial, I would like to say that the movie is not easy to sit through (the book's story is pretty depressing), but, it offers two stories that complement each other very well, and let you think about how they affect one another."
" Nocturnally Breathtaking
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,10,"Tom Ford hits a home run with Nocturnal Animals. The man knows fashion and also film. This film is not only disturbing but beautiful at the same time. Ford's creative style of directing shows that he is no amateur. Like his first film A Single Man (2009), He delivers a powerful film that will leave the viewer at the edge of your seat. At times during the film i was so impressed on how he made me feel the pain for Jake Gyllenhaal's character. Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon deliver tier 1 performances! This is one film that you do not want to miss! And if you want to take your experience even further, go out and buy the book Tony and Susan written by Austin Wright. You will not be disappointed!"
" Garbage, don't trust the rating.
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,5,"*This review doesn't contain actual spoilers, but you can inference what DOESN'T happen at the end of the movie from this review, and that could be a spoiler in and of itself* After wasting 2 hours watching this, I was so shocked by the (current) 7.8 IMDb rating that I decided to waste another 15 minutes of my life and add up the ratings of the 164 people who had left a review and rating, and compare that to the anonymous ratings left by supposedly real people. I strongly felt, and feel, that the IMDb ballot box for this movie is being stuffed so to speak. Not surprising in an age where companies unabashedly advertise on TV that they will build your website for you and then fill it with good (fake) reviews. The result of my find, was that the average rating for all 164 people who left a review was 6.5, which is a pretty far cry from a 7.8 on IMDb when it comes to movie quality. A movie approaching 8 stars is generally considered a must-see, whereas a movie with 6.5 stars is rather mediocre. That said, I still feel that even the 6.5 rating is skewed, because as a newer movie that won't even hit home video for some time, it's stacked with an initially high percentage of movie critic reviews as opposed to actual moviegoers, and we all know how critics love pointless, artsy fartsy movies by snobbish directors who don't feel like there has to be any point or meaningful conclusion to a movie. As I skimmed through the reviews, it was apparent to me that the 9 and 10 star reviews were largely from critics and art lovers, where as the plethora of 1 and 2 star reviews were from average moviegoers.On that note, IMHO this movie is utter garbage with little to no redeeming qualities, and a complete waste of 2 hours of your life. As someone else aptly titled their review, it's like sex without the orgasm, however that's being far too generous to this movie since at least sex is enjoyable, if not fulfilling, without the orgasm lol. The writing, screenplay, pacing, acting, and especially directing, were among the worst I've ever seen, which is sad because there are a few very good actors in it (and some very bad ones) who have turned in very compelling performances in the past. I honestly don't know what this movie bills itself as. I know what I was expecting beforehand and as I was watching it, and that's a suspenseful, psychological thriller that must be building up to some really great plot twist. But nope, it simply flat lined, literally and figuratively.Separate out the stories within the story, and there's no way in hell a studio would've ever made a movie about either of them. The real life of Amy Adams character was insanely boring, commonplace, and pointless. The story within the manuscript was very drawn out with poor dialogue, poor acting, poor direction, and absolutely no meaningful or redeeming conclusion. It's like some real life writer wrote a short story (which is all the manuscript inside this movie really is), and then desperately tried to stretch that out into a full length movie. Ever seen the ""The Box"" with Cameron Diaz, which was based on a short story? That movie had a kernel of an interesting idea, along with two or three good actors, but those elements aren't enough to make a good, full length movie, and the result was a hot mess. That's exactly what happened here. The real lives of Amy and Jake's characters are completely and totally pointless if they don't in some meaningful way tie in to the story of the manuscript (which they don't), so why even bother with that side of the movie if that story isn't compelling and doesn't even lead anywhere? The answer is simple, because without it, much like ""The Box"", you have maybe 30-40 minutes of an incredibly humdrum screenplay consisting only of the manuscript itself, with an immensely unfulfilling and unimaginative conclusion.Honestly, as it progressed, I was fully expecting this movie to have a sort of ""Jacob's Ladder"" type ending, with the audience discovering that TONY had actually killed Susan and his daughter in real life many years ago, for whatever reason, and that perhaps he was now in prison or an institution etc., creating a sort of fantasy world for himself, imagining that he's finally become a successful writer and that their deaths were just a story in one of his books, in which he ends up avenging them and sacrifices himself in the process, while meanwhile his wife and daughter are alive and well and living out their lives without him. IMHO that certainly could've been spun into a much more compelling ending than this pile of garbage.If you haven't seen ""Jacob's Ladder"", and you want to see a GOOD psychological thriller that actually deserves the 9 and 10 star ratings that so many people inexplicably have given this, rent it on Netflix or whatever now. If you like an intriguing movie that makes you THINK about what's real and what isn't, yet entertains as well as scares you, and also makes you feel like you need to watching it another time or two to really understand it, THAT'S the movie for you. You'd be far better served watching it twice than watching this movie once. Also, for the Jake Gyllenhaal fans out there, watch Zodiac if you haven't already. Again, a suspenseful thriller that is far more deserving of some of the ratings and reviews this movie has gotten."
" An art gallery of an art gallery owner with an art gallery of revenge.
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.First off, I really had some thought in favour and against before turning this motion picture on. Should I watch this? Will this be anything to grasp? If you like movies that is far off the ordinary, watch ""Nocturnal animals"". Otherwise; look at something else.A story of a woman being mean and off to her ex partner 20 years in the past, just to be reminded through a script sent to her written by the same partner. A day to day life of the successful art gallery owner Susan Morrow blends with the gritty and hard script sent to her, displayed as a hard boiled drama thriller. Together with the manuscript the production team brings a real hard atmosphere to the audience. The tension that is created with delicacy is amazing; an on edge experience! Tom Ford has done a tremendous job in pushing the actors to create that special moment and tension even more.This movie is like the film ""Neon Demon"", speaking of the visual excellence coming into place in the world of (Amy Adams). The difference is that ""Nocturnal Animals"" has a driven and rough story that both polish the raw side of the fiction and at the same time shows the art of complexity.The writers have had some clear breakthrough speaking of the creativity within the story. To create a fasade of excellence and state of the art film noir to show a successful woman's life in art, and letting a script show off the thriller side of the movie is genius... pure genius.Nominated for three Golden Globes, and I have to say that is fair. Remember; revenge is best served ice cold on the rocks... empty left in a restaurant.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : The soundtrack lifts this really high up there. Especially in Susan Morrows life; some both awkward and boring situations tweaked maximum with ""dangerous and professional"" music spoken out by an orchestra. The touch of letting new angles in the experience for the viewer being shown and come into place is thoughtful and enjoyable to watch. The visual editing is so run through with creativity and innovative thinking that it were more than inspiring to watch. - The actors : Jake Gyllenhaal nails the character of Tony Hastings. His presence and relaxed confidence shines through; many times I were left in awe. One example: look at his outburst at approximately 1 hour and 14 minutes into this one in the little cabin. Fantastic! - Entertainment : As an piece of art; strange and wonderful at the same time. - Age : 157,6 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)"
" Great Deception
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,3,"In Los Angeles, the wealthy owner of an art gallery Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) has a loveless marriage with Hutton Morrow (Armie Hammer), who is cheating on her. Out of the blue, she receives a book manuscript from her ex-husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) entitled ""Nocturne Animals"" and dedicated to her. They have been divorced for nineteen years and now Edward is asking for her opinion. The novel is about a man called Tony Hastings (Jake Gyllenhaal) that is traveling on vacation by car with his wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and their teenage daughter India (Ellie Bamber) through a lonely road. Out of the blue, a car bumps their car and throws them off the-road. The troublemakers Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Turk (Robert Aramayo) abduct Laura and India while Lou (Karl Glusman) dumps Tony in an isolated road. Tony walks to the police station and ranger Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon) finds Laura and India raped and murdered. Meanwhile Susan recalls her relationship with Edward and rekindles her love for him. ""Nocturnal Animals"" is a deceptive movie by Tom Ford. The overrated IMDb rating associated to the names of Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal increases the deception of any viewer. Tony Hastings is a weak and unlikable character. The two segments are poorly resolved and the conclusion of each segment is awful. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Animais Noturnos"" (""Nocturnal Animals"")"
" Watchable and forgettable
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,2,"The parents of the main character are depicted as bigoted, sexist, Republicans by the woman. I am sparing some of the labels. That was more than enough to have an idea of what the political likings of the movie makers are. Why every mediocre Hollywood director or actor has to patronize the public with their political science nonsense?Whatever.The bullies are unlikely in their extreme behavior. The main woman character's emotions, when reading the novel, are overly exaggerated.The main male character is way, overly too weak, although this is supposed to be his millennial charm, maybe. He shows strength then the final moments his weakness borders on the pathetic. Or maybe doesn't even border, it is just pathetic.Must say that this seemed like an enjoyable attempt at deeper movie making than the usual brainless mass production of Hollywood. But a bit outlandish ending, and abrupt."
