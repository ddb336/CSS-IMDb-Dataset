" Lovely beautiful film, I cried twice, it was warm and interesting
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,8,"I think I still need some time to process this film, but for now I have to say what seems so simple its so thoughtfully made. A coming of age from a middle life point of view and the message that change is good. I am beginning to think that Mia Hansen-Love has still a lot to give and I am genuinely excited for her films to come."
" Longueurs
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,1,"Nothing much happens. Even the philosophy that's thrown around, appears to be insubstantial and impractical.Surely the moral of this story can't be that philosophy is not only useless but actually sucks any joy out of life? Is there a single person in this film who doesn't appear to be, at heart, both miserable and revelling in their misery?A terrible waste of time."
" The future
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,8,"Nathalie's vacation model runs through the entire movie. When many people are old, they may regret it because they have no time or no opportunity to enjoy their time. In fact, giving up is not always a bad thing. In one's live, there are always times when we need to give up. Learning to let it go will make us move forward more easily. Give up those who do not want to take away and throw away the things you do not want to remember. Let yourself believe that there will be a broader existence when you move forward. No matter what form the future happens, our life will always continue. The future is now, and it is the most important thing to live well in every moment now."
" A comfortable film
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,8,"There's one word for this film, ""comfortable"".The costumes, sets, and acting are all super."
" Slow movie and lack of a good plot
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,2,"I watched this movie solely because if its high average rating on IMDB but I was disappointed to find out that it is totally misgraded. Probably the movie makers have very large families who have rated it with bias. The movie itself has no sens-morale, it is too long for how much actually happens, and many conversations and persons who appear have absolutely no point at all."
" Life, philosophy, Huppert!
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,8,"It would be wrong to say there's not a great deal that happens in Mia Love-Hansen's film 'Things to Come': we see births, deaths and marriages (fall apart), as well as the extended tale of an unwanted cat. But it's all presented as the proceeding of normal life, and convincingly so; things happen and lives undergo incremental, and incidental change: this isn't a tightly wound narrative with a driven sequence of events. It may sound boring, but it never is, thanks mostly to a very good performance from the always interesting Isabelle Huppert, playing a woman facing what she never allows herself to portray as a stereotypical description of a mid-life crisis, even though it features some common elements. Ultimately, this is a small movie, but it's both very specific (Huppert's character is a philosophy teacher and moves in a particular mileau) and yet true to life more generally. Highly recommended."
" Needing purpose
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,9,"This, for me, is a film about becoming lost but needing to find a way back to connection with the world and your purpose.A philosophy teacher disconnected from her job is confronted by her husband announcing he is leaving her for another women. Shortly afterwards we see her committing her elderly mother to a care home and subsequently inheriting her mother's cat. She claims to be allergic to the cat- I think this is poignant for her later transformation.
Later on her mother dies and she finds herself lost, confused, upset and puzzled by the meaning of everything around her
She goes to stay with her former student Fabian in the french countryside. After being picked up at the train station by him she tells him this is the first time she has truly been free- her mother has gone, her children have left home and her husband as left her. She seems to sigh with an aura of bliss but with a bitter sweet ambience of helplessness.
She brings her cat along on her little trip and the cat disappears into the wilderness and she spends the evening shouting into the abyss for her. The next morning when the cat returns she is overwhelmed with relief as her cat presents a freshly caught mouse for her, strangely cuddling the cat (Pandora) without showing signs of any allergy. That cat that she was fed up with and saw as a nuisance is her saviour. She needs to find purpose and meaning in her world that has dissipated before her eyes.We see at the end of the film after she has prepared dinner at Christmas for her family her grandson is crying in the bedroom. Her daughter- the new mother- gets up to see to him- but the now grandmother tells her she will see to him...then comforts him in her arms and roll the credits.Some may see this as a collection of very well acted, realist scenes exploring relationships between her and the people she encounters but deeper I feel the film is about the need to find purpose and when this disappears it can be found in the strangest of places - including a cat you're allergic too!"
" Pretentious French Cinema at its worst.
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,3,"I usually like French Cinema, because it often tackles subjects we don't get from Hollywood. It also usually does so with style, and sometimes wit. I don't even mind the idea of trying to find a good story in an ordinary life, but this misses the mark. This movie is about the middle-aged, upper middle class, neighbor down the street who's getting a divorce. The end. This movie just sort of meanders SLOWLY through that scenario. There is nothing cinematic or insightful about the story. Oh, and for all the Isabelle Huppert fans out there, she simply isn't that great. Stop indulging your French bias. I don't mind her, but I can think of half a dozen actresses who can act circles around her. Meryl Streep obviously. Patricia Clarkson also comes to mind (she would have been fantastic in such a role). There was a movie to made here, there was a story worth telling...but they missed, by a lot."
" Things To Come - The Future
",2019-03-28 00:00:00,9,"'L'Avenir' (The Future) is something of a rarity as today's movies go and all the better for it. Had I known it was written and directed by Mia Hanson-Love I might have decided to stay well away - after being disappointed by the 2011 'Goodbye First Love'. But, with this surprisingly mature work she has taken her own family experiences and crafted a story so filled with thoughtful observations the viewer feels more like a voyeur - within the unfolding lives of these very real characters. I kept expecting the now common clichés to start unfolding i.e.; lonely deserted wife seeks solace in a carnal relationship - but surprisingly and pleasingly, all superficial TV and cinema modernisms are avoided in preference to intelligent character study.Being raised in a home with two philosophy teachers as parents, Mia Hansson- Love uses in-depth philosophy to examine her central theme/s. Nathalie, her main character, illustrates strong points by telling her family, acquaintances, and students, that in her youth she had been surrounded by Stalinists but, she read Solzhenitsyn (who exposed many vague notions about the 'idealism' of the USSR!). Without labouring her points, she invites her students and anarchist friends to think for themselves, even lifting a veil against the trendy leanings of Post Modernism. She freely quotes the philosophies of Rousseau and Gunther Anders (might any of this had an influence on the avoidance of sensationalised clichés within the intelligence level of Love's script...I wonder?) With succinct statements Nathalie invites them to recognise the positive points of right and wrong with an open mind. This is a woman grounded in pure realism - even though, beyond her control, some elements that have constituted her world till now are beginning to alter.If I may have questioned anything it could have been the resolve with which she accepts some of her situations - she says to her husband and the father of her children; ""I thought you would love me forever"" - then simply, without even questioning his leaving her, goes along with it. This could be the reaction of someone who was expecting the situation, but to one who thought all was well....I'm not so sure. Nathalie is superbly played by Isabelle Huppert and supported by a well chosen cast who, take us on a slice-of-life journey that's reminiscent of some of Bergman's better works - examining the intimate challenges that life brings into most all our paths - without trivializing or cheapening the experience. The careful selection & use of music is evident (as with earlier works) adding to the soundly grounded profundity of this enlightening cinematic achievement. The fluid imagery of prolific cinematographer Denis Lenoir (Still Alice '14) is not always suited to subtitled topics but one imagines the budget and subject would have dictated this style - so, some may find viewing and reading could need a little extra concentration at times. Still, the rewards are well worth any efforts necessary to stay with this strong and satisfying work."
" A Huppert vehicle
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,3,"Huppert is always worth watching, plus there are lovely shots of Paris - the real city, not the Woody Allen version - and a terrific cat. That's about all though. A plot would have helped."
" TIME CAN DO SO MUCH
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,7,"I recommende this fascinating movie of Mia Hansen-Løve inspired in your mother life´s. I question myself why this movie was not in the Cannes? The shot is wonderfull with scenes of everyday life in Paris, in beach trip and mountain refuge (Grenoble).It´s a short movie (1h30min) which made me like it. Isabelle Huppert have a magnific actuation. However, the main character has 40 years and Huppert more than 60. Ok, this was not a problem. Sometimes the main character was a typical Frances boring, with gesture, expressions and customs that only the French understand. It reminded me a lot of my experiences in France, and that was very good. The final is very intersting followed by The Fleetwoods - Unchained Melody. I conclude that freedom must always be present in our lives, and that freedom and time can solve any problem life´s, as unemployment, love, disappointment, etc. I really liked it. My note is 7/10, but almost 8/10. R - 7/10"
" Huppert shines
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,7,"Nathalie Chazeaux (Isabelle Huppert) is a Parisian high-school philosophy teacher in her sixties. She seems to have an ideal family life. Her husband Heinz (André Marcon) also teaches philosophy at the same school and they have a content family life at home with their two young adult children. As the film progresses, life situations becomes less ideal for Nathalie including the mental and physical decline of her high-maintenance mother (Edith Scob).The film's beginning was fascinating. It included school protests against the current state of France; it also included a disagreement Nathalie has with a pair of marketing experts on how her book, written years ago, should be packaged to sell better. These scenes seemed to promise a critique of our modern times. While those themes more or less dissipated after the beginning, ""Things to Come"" remains an insightful film at other levels.Yet again, Huppert raises the film to a higher level with her talent and presence portraying a role with which many in her life situation could identify. She seems strangely cool when given bad news but her humanity (and tears) show more clearly when she is alone.This coolness is especially apparent in her final scene with Marcon. It is amazing how both seem to be having a casual conversation but there is so much bite and sadness in the subtext beneath their words. This scene is quite remarkable.Director/writer Mia Hansen-Love presents her fine story free of any flash. Sometimes, this subtlety is welcome but this movie might have used just a little more flash to heighten a few scenes. But with such a fine lead player, Hansen-Love might have found this unnecessary. The bonus is the various philosophical discussions (including talk of the events around the 1968 uprising) which Nathalie has with her husband, her classes at school, and a former prized student who now lives in an anarchist commune in the countryside."
" Things must come
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Things to Come< is what makes each person's life move on, but it's only when everything happens differently from what was expected it really becomes life."
" Oh la la french cinema
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,8,"As Claude Chabrol said, ""Isabelle Huppert makes her own films, the director and everybody else are just there to help"". This one is perfectly suited for her restrained style. A woman´s life is changing considerably and she carries on. Simple enough but oh there´s so much more to it. This realistic story-telling makes a short scene of her tearing up in the car more effective than a full house melodrama. A serious, intelligent film with poignant reflections on maturity, idealism and more. The realism holds its logic all the way until the ending.For someone used to french cinema it isn´t that outstanding but it´s such a serious piece of film-making it stands out among the rest. In my opinion the last section could have been trimmed and I have a couple of petty complaints but overall it´s still a compelling film. A pleasant drama that should easily satisfy anyone who knows what they´re getting into."
" very french
",2018-01-27 00:00:00,6,"Nathalie Chazeaux (Isabelle Huppert) is a philosophy professor although a student strike is challenging the faculty. She is married but her husband reveals his cheating. Worst yet, he has to tell her as he moves out of the house. Her kids are moving on. Her disturbed mother keeps pulling her into her life. Her former student reconnects with her. As each part of her life is severed, she finds life in her new freedom.This is very french especially how Nathalie reacts to her husband's revelation. It doesn't have to be melodramatic but I would like for more drama. The danger is never that high although there is surely some emotional dangers. Huppert's classy acting keeps the movie compelling. I would like to have her disconnecting happen in the first half hour. Instead, it's dragged over an hour and there isn't enough time for her to find herself. It's the shortest of freedom rides. It's understated. I prefer something more dramatic."
" 2/10 why ? 1 for the cat and 1 for the mountains
",2017-10-28 00:00:00,2,"To all those people who voted it 5 star plus, folks, ..lets not be pretentious.... any normal sane person would see how slow, pointless and boring the film is. The director put more emphasis on philosophy than the lead character. The mountain scenery and the pet cat were the only bright moments in the film"
" Zut Alors, what a bores
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,2,"Gave it 2 because of good photography and location shots. I watched in the sincere and desperate hope of superior GILF Isabelle Huppert getting smutty, cos you know, it's a French film innit? And they always get their kit off don't they? Instead I got a pretentious French philosophical waffle-a-thon that left me in a Nihilistic post Dioginistic trance with Platonic overtones. Watching paint dry would rival this for entertainment value. It appears to be a vanity piece for the director/writer to demonstrate they studied philosophy."
" ...wonderful, unequaled, and timeless
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,7,"Young actors today would do well to watch carefully and learn from this amazing woman. She's been doing it for such a long time, and for each work she is a part of is that much more memorable for what seems like such very subtle reasons. She is just spectacularly comfortable in the life of all the characters she portrays. She is unquestionably one of the finest actors to grace the screen of any age... with an unlimited, timeless grace commanding any story-line she chooses. This is a very emblematic film for her, and it is oh so hard to imagine another actor that would be able to substitute in the part to give it the complexity and depth she is able to impart. It is what makes her so special, and why with every new contact I become more infatuated with her unmatched talent. She's wonderful, unequaled, and timeless."
" A load of pretentious rubbish
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,3,"Another French film that should/ could have been great. Stilted dialogue about Philosophy. And how come if the French [ who I love, their country, their culture, their history , their language etc ] generally always have English/American songs on their soundtrack when they are so pedantic about keeping the French language ''pure''.....I couldn't wait for it to finish [ as did my partner ]"
" What a total waste of time...
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,3,"Del Amitri, a Scottish pop band, wrote a brilliant song called Nothing Ever Happens- and it is probably summed up in this piece of utter drivel. What a bore-fest if ever there was one. Believe the positive reviews if you want to, but they're all fake as far as I'm concerned. I truly do not know what is going on in IMDb. Soap operas on TV are far superior to this piece of pretentious garbage. Okay, the acting was very good, but good acting cannot ever elevate a boring movie. I am truly fed up with people giving good reviews to films that are not in the least good, but I suppose that's the way of the world. Give 100 people an assignment to help a poor movie by giving it great reviews - and bingo! - the film will do much better. I suppose we'll all just need to live with false reviews. Please watch this movie, as I did, and you will see I am being candid and frank. Good luck to you if you think it deserves the good reviews."
" Pretentious, artificial, awful
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,1,"It has been a long time since I last saw a more pretentious, artificial, unnatural film as this one. The acting is artificial, the plot is non- existent, the theme unnatural. The same unnatural French issues, never saying anything, cryptic and lacking any kind of depth. Absolutely awful and boring, boring in the deepest sense - why would anyone make a film about nothing to say nothing, to transmit nothing, to show nothing?!"
" Things to come is a tale of changes that would alter the way we are, how we lead and what we become.
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,8,"I am enamored by Huppert's performance. Hansen's tale on Nathalie brings a fresh take on how we can relate to change. In the process of syncing our thoughts and actions, are we changing our lifestyle?or we imagine an alternate reality/ cease to relate to reality and move on with hope and passion."
" Isabelle Huppert is a thing of beauty and a joy forever
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,10,"The French film L'avenir was shown in the U.S. with the title Things to Come (2016). It was written and directed by Mia Hansen-Løve.The movie stars Isabelle Huppert as Nathalie Chazeaux, a gifted philosophy professor and textbook author. She has an happy life, with a loving husband and two loving children. She has a burden as well--her mother suffers from dementia, and will soon have to be placed in a nursing home. In a matter of days, things start to turn sour for Nathalie, and that's where the plot begins.The plot takes Nathalie from her beautiful home in Paris, to a vacation home in Brittany, to a rural farming commune. Each of these locations is beautifully photographed. Because of the wonderful scenery, the movie will work better on a large screen. (We saw it at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY.) Still, it's such a superb film, that if you can't see it in a theater, see it on the small screen.All the supporting actors do a good job, and each is believable. However, all of them could be interchanged with other actors who have same level of ability. No one could replace Huppert. She is so talented, intelligent, attractive, and graceful that she was made to play this role. Without her, the movie might not work. With her, it's masterful. This film is too good to miss!P.S. The only other actor to match Huppert's level of talent and grace is Pandora, the cat. Pandora is old, and she has been pampered, but when she needs to catch a mouse, she catches a mouse."
" A realistic and affecting slice of a woman's life
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,7,"I read some reviews wondering about the point of the movie: I think asking for the point is simply insignificant when watching a movie like this. It depicts a portion of a mature woman's life, a philosophy teacher and an intellectually brilliant editor, having to come to terms with loss, abandonment and conscious aging. One would say: nothing new, nothing original, or interesting. On the contrary, I found the picture deeply affecting, in the apparently placid but still very focused and deep way it portray this normal life. It reflects so realistically the natural and typical feminine facing of things as they come, that it gets intrinsically authentic and involving. As usual, Isabelle Huppert does not only interpret but lives her character and is the real pillar of strength of the picture. If you love unpretentious but simply authentic women's stories you'll like this movie, and you won't have to ask where the point is."
" Life goes on
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,8,"Until this movie I never quite got the hype for Mia Hansen-Løve. Her slice-of-life, semi- autobiographical movies seemed forgettable to me. Maybe Hansen-Løve is growing as an artist, or maybe it's just Huppert. Whatever it is, Things to Come, is a movie that's stuck in my mind, a beautiful portrait of a woman whose life is upended just as she is entering the final third of her life. The great French actress Isabelle Huppert plays Nathalie (based on Hansen-Løve's own mother). A successful philosophy professor with two grown children, a fellow philosopher for a husband, and an ailing mother, she is comfortably settled in her life. But as the movie continues on we watch as the things that Nathalie considered so much a part of her, change, dissolve, disintegrate. I'll admit it, I was actually initially reluctant to watch the movie because the idea of seeing a woman having everything taken away from her seemed almost too sad to bear. And yet Things to Come is a surprisingly joyful movie. Nathalie isn't an automaton, she cries as the things she once counted on as part of her life are no more, but at the same time she picks herself up, dusts herself off and goes on."
" ""The future is compromised""
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,8,"""Things to Come"" (2016 release from France; original title ""L'Avenir"" (The Future); 100 min.) brings the story of Nathalie, As the movie opens, we see Nathalie and her family visiting the burial site of Chateaubriand at St. Malo in Brittany. We then go to ""Some Years Later"", and Nathalie and her husband Heinz, both lyceum teachers, are dealing with various student protests against ""the reform"", much to their irritation. In a parallel story, Nathalie needs to deal with her aging mother, who seemingly calls her every 5 minutes regarding an ailment (real or perceived). At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from French writer-director Mia Hansen-Løve, best known for the excellent ""Father of My Children"" some years ago. Here she brings to the big screen a seemingly ordinary slice of life about a women in her late fifties, dealing with changes around her: her aging mom, issues at school, issues with her husband, issues with her schoolbook publishing company, etc. etc. No bomb explosions, no special effects, no car chases, just people interacting and living their lives. The first hour of the movie plays out in Paris, and makes day-to-day life in Paris look fantastic: mostly sunny weather, people playing in the park, people enjoying a coffee on a sidewalk terrace, etc. (Having grown up in nearby Belgium, I can assure you that in reality the weather is rarely that nice...) The rests of the movie plays out at the family's summer house in Brittany, and also in the Rhone mountains. But the very best part of the movie is of course to watch Isabelle Huppert in action. In my mind, Huppert is the European Meryl Streeo (they are about the same age), and Huppert seemingly is only getting better as she's getting older (just like Streep). Here Huppert brings the Nathalie character with a vulnerability yet an equal amount of determination. In one of her classes, she asks the students ""can the established truth be debated?"" Later on, she concludes that ""the future is compromised"".""Things to Come"" won major acclaim when it premiered at the Berlin film festival last year, and rightfully so. As it happens, Huppert released another film last year, ""Elle"", that won her even greater acclaim. It's tough when you're competing against yourself. ""Things to Come"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati (the same theater where ""Elle"" is still showing, coincidentally). The Sunday matinée screening where I saw this at was packed, to my surprise. I guess the word is out that basically any film starring Isabelle Huppert is almost certainly a must-see, and that certainly is the case here. ""Things to Come"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
" Telling something without telling anything
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,3,"This is a typical French film. One of those films that go flat and more flat that only serve to lengthen the film why you can not or want to make an ellipsis, although what you have to count is already counted. It's too long. I think he wants to tell a number of things but he does not really count anything or everything goes so far as to say nothing. I'll tell you something in the spoiler zone.The actors are very natural, the problem is that I do not know what role they have in the film half of them.Photography is as always in this type of non-existent films. Looks like they used a video camera.The direction, nonexistent for several reasons, if the director does not know that there are so many planes that delay the film, bad. The plans are as if we see a play, general in the foreground, but this is cinema, we must use audiovisual language.I imagine that it will be me, that less and less of cinema.Spoiler:Try to tell us how a couple disarms, but if it was not because they told me they are a couple, I would not have seen it because they could be friends who live together and more if they are people as you design, cultured, intelligent, nice . I should show you before that you are a couple and then see how you disarm. But in reality I only see that it breaks and nothing happens."
" Frankfurt Middle School
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"If this movie could have lived up to all of the ideas it flirts with and all of the things it proposes, it could have been a masterpiece. But it didn't, so it isn't. But, look, I actually don't care so much. Why not? Because Isabelle Huppert is incredible. I don't really follow actors much. I'm more of a classic ""Auteurist"", trained by Sarris' American Cinema. But Isabelle...She is a phenomenon. You can feel her intelligence in every shot; you can feel her thinking. And she maintains a remarkable girlishness, even in her sixties. Isabelle...OK, enough of that!But a film which engages with the desperate search for new paradigms of Resistance and Revolution...A film which brings in a Zizek reference right on cue, in a non - name dropping kind of way. This is a film which matters - or which could matter, if the look was not so French Lifetime Channel. I mean, I know I'm showing my age if I say that I would like a film which engages with ideas to also engage with them on the level of Film Grammar. I mean, Adorno's Minima Moralia (referenced several times) is Adorno for Beginners - the film coulda reflected that work on some kind of structural level, at least a LITTLE bit, without losing the audience. At least I think so! Or hope so...I would've hoped for something on the level of Godard's La Chinoise, but the film is closer to Tanner's Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000. But, for 2016, that's pretty good...pretty good. Anyway, it's hip for French directors to turn their backs on Godard now - I heard Desplechin announce (with pride) that he had moved from Godard to Truffaut. Well, if My Golden Years is any indication, it's not a good move...Things to Come is not a great film. But it is filled with lots of Little Beauties. I loved the Woody Guthrie scene. Especially how actor Roman Kolinka really nails Woody's nuances, albeit with a Gallic lilt. All of the references - literary, musical - are note - perfect and done with excellent taste. But - (Tl;dr) - all this really proves is that French Middlebrow Culture is closer to Highbrow Culture than American Middlebrow Culture is."
" Post-divorce trauma is full of cinematic potential that is not fulfilled in this story.
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,6,"Isabelle Huppert is one of French cinema's finest and her name alone is enough to raise expectations of Things to Come (2016). At a glance, the film promises much: a strong storyline, a beautiful setting, an iconic star. The post-divorce adjustment cycle of trauma, grief, renewal and anticipation of new beginnings is full of cinematic potential. Instead, we find an abundance of prolonged silence, empty space and vacant stares: the promise of things to come is never fulfilled.Nathalie (Isabelle Huppert) is a contented academic intellectual who busies herself in the world of philosophy. Her long marriage is abruptly terminated by her equally intellectual husband who has found a new love, an announcement he makes with as much emotion as ordering home-delivery pizza. Nathalie's response similarly has as much depth as a quibble over pastrami or ham topping and she remains at this level throughout. Then her textbook contract is cancelled because of falling interest in philosophy and her high-maintenance mother passes away. All three triggers offer freedom, but Nathalie stalls in self-despair and victimhood.She attaches herself to a former student to search for her youth and affection, a hope doomed from the start. Her estranged husband moves on with a full life in contrast to her own aimless search to fill the void that now consumes her. Despite her lofty philosophical grasp on life and frequent quotations from eminent authors, she becomes just another woman who is a victim of a man's decision. The film studies her loneliness with voyeuristic intensity as if her version of abandonment is somehow more enlightened than others, but it is not.The film is cinematically warm with an intimate style of photography, but the characterisation is shallow. A self-absorbed introvert before the breakup, Nathalie speaks of the joys of new-found freedom but simply cannot act on her new opportunities. If this film was given to a lesser actress than Huppert it would struggle for air. It still does, but it breathes. It stretches patience for a film to hope that empty silence and prolonged focus on inconsequential or motionless detail will be read through the lens of Huppert's past reputation for inspired depth of meaning and emotional intensity.It may well be that the emptiness of this story is entirely intended. If so, it will be seen by many as a great success. The musical score gives the story some uplift, even hope, but there are limits to what can be achieved with even the most haunting acapella rendition of Unchained Melody or lively Arlo Guthrie singalong. The ambivalent climax and the emotional ambiguity of the film itself is the only lasting memory. AUTHOR: cinemusefilms.com"
