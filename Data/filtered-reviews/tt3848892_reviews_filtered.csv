" Salute to Team B.A.B.Y
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,10,"A spectacular watch. No film can deal with ""Terrorism"" portion like this one.... will teach you about armies and agents - and how they stand with our countries amidst rising threats from Muslim ruled countries.Good performance wins the heart. Akshay-Neeraj combo did an excellent work. Although the box office remains decent."
" A good script spoiled by low standard acting
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,3,"Please guys be honest and rate the movies.
To be honest these actors are doing movies like this because it doesn't matter to them as they are paid anyways.
As a viewer we need to be honest and stop watching whatever comes in box office."
" Must watch
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,10,"Must watch and lives upto the expectations of being a neeraj pandey film.

A perfect movie after special 26"

" One of the Best Indian Thriller Movie Made
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,8,"I'm a movie buff and watch almost every movie. Last time, I was so excited about a movie was when I saw Ugly! Talking about Neeraj Pandey, I'm among those very people who didn't find the climax of Special Chabbees exciting. In fact, I was able to guess the finale long before it started. And so for me, the finale was the weakest link in Special Chhabees. For A Wednesday, it was a great thriller from start till end.Now coming to the Baby! The first half started with bang and I was really looking forward to the movie. However, right about the interval, I was thinking that it wasn't all that great! And that's where I was wrong. With the entry of Taapsee Pannu, started a race against time. And here's where Neeraj Pandey really really blew my mind. That's how a thriller is made. Stupid movies like Race 2 ought to learn from this movie. The second half kept me at the edge of my seat that seldom any Hindi movie does.Kudos to the Baby team for contributing such a gem to Indian Cinema. Thrillers like A Wednesday, Ugly, and Baby are a rare treat to movie goers like me, who just can't leave their brains at home. The critics can find all the fault they want in this movie, but for me it's one of Neeraj's best.Akshay did a very good job. He is a versatile actor who should do more sensible movies instead of movies like Once Upon A Time In Mumbai - 2. But I'm all praise for Tapsee Pannu. Unlike every Telugu movie, where the heroine is a Bimbo, Tapsee showed her acting prowess with this movie. Anupam Kher was excellent as always. Not much can be said about Rana Daggubati as his role wasn't meaty enough!All in all, I really enjoyed this movie. Will definitely see again on Silver Screen, too! Urge you all to watch this movie if you really want a fast paced Indian thriller."
" One of best Bollywood thrillers in recent time.
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,8,"Baby review:Hindi cinema has churned out many espionage thrillers before; from ""Farz"" in the 60s to ""Agent Vinod"" in recent times. But most of these films suffered from the Bollywood ""song and melodrama"" syndrome which ended up diluting the thriller element. Hence, Baby, written, scripted and directed by Neeraj Pandey (A Wednesday and Special 26 fame) comes as a welcome surprise.In its running time of 160 minutes, I didn't get distracted or felt the urge to check my cell for even a minute; a feat only Hollywood thrillers have achieved so far. Cutting straight to the action from its first scene, the film details a covert operation executed by a handful of undercover agents to bust a dreaded terrorist organisation. Some influence of ""Argo"", ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and Nikhil Advani's far inferior ""D-day"" are evident. But Pandey deserves credit for keeping his narrative gripping and entertaining right till the end.On the acting front, Akshay Kumar is brilliant as the lead agent, infusing the right amount of physicality and restraint in his performance. Danny Denzongpa suits the role of the IB chief perfectly. Anupam Kher makes his presence felt even in a small role. Kay Kay Menon, in a negative role, exudes menace. Taapsee Pannu is super impressive even in a small role.The movie has been shot beautifully in locales of Turkey, Nepal and Saudi. The technical department is of high standards as expected from a film of this scale.Undoubtedly, Baby is one of the finest thrillers I have seen in Hindi cinema. Hollywood influence aside, it will still keep you on edge of your seat throughout.Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni."
" Who the hell is giving negative reviews
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,10,"Masterpiece delivered by Bollywood. Greatest thriller movie made by Neeraj Pandey. Akshay Kumar, Rana, Tapsee, Anupam Kher, K K Menon has given their best performance. People who are giving negative reviews have a very bad taste in movies."
" Gem of Indian cinema( Neeraj ka kamaal)
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,10,This is one of the best thriller I watched in my life. After watching lot of junk Bolly films this gave me different feeling. This film make you engage throughout and it will don't make bore at any moment. After special 26 Akshay and kher pair rocks in this film. Finally a must watch film can't be missed.

" An elite encounter with (tik tok) clocky speed
",2019-11-28 00:00:00,9,"Baby...dont even compare the name and judge it.if u did..then you are the baby..
The title deserves..one movie for a while..one for nation...really patriotic ..very delightful..gave a masterpiece work..salute to neeraj pandey sir..a great effort."
" Edge of the seat action thriller
",2019-09-24 00:00:00,9,"Baby is a superb espionage thriller with good storytelling, engaging script and patriotism with ample dose. Barring rana(he is a great actor but was not given much to perform), all the actors have given terrific performances. Akshay Kumar is perfect as Ajay, Danny denzongpa was classy and standard, taapsee was badass in her action scene, kk Menon shines in his typical style. But the show stealer is Anupam kher who despite coming in the last 30 minutes takes the limelight. Only drawback is the length and it gets dragged towards end. The walking scenes could have been edited. On the whole baby is another masterpiece from Neeraj Pandey."
" Thriller and Nationalism at its best
",2019-09-21 00:00:00,10,"Why is it this movie does not make 200cr and salman""s rubbish makes 200cr easily is beyond belief. There is a missing jigsaw which does not make sense. Just compare it with Tiger Zinda Hai, BABY is by far a superior product and yet the public goes for salman"
" BEST SPY THRILLER EVER MADE IN INDIA

" ""Masterpiece""
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,9,Wonderful!! Excitement continues till the last moment. I can't pause it for a single moment till the end. After ending I've taken a short break & now writing the review! :D Another point is that this film is completely free from usual romanticism. Without such romanticism it is successful to create excitement & perfect thrilling experience throughout the 2hour 39 minutes! Every moment I was confusedly thinking what is going to happening in the next moment! For a great thrilling experience through exciting your nerves watch it. It's a must watch! Acting of 5 members of Baby gang is really excellent specially Akshay.
" Baby
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,7,Good Movie. Akshay Kumar and everybody acted very well in the movie. BGM and fight scenes in the movie was excellent. The movie had many interesting scenes and many thrilling investigation scenes in the 1st half. But in the 2nd half the movie bored a bit. The movie had many interesting and thrilling scenes. Heroine is not needed in the movie. Good Movie.
" Masterpiece
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,10,This movie deserves another movie at least only if makers have a good script otherwise don't rush making the movie. The hero of the story is the script and screenplay very tight and it keeps you on the edge of your seat.
" Murders, tortures, and needless cruelty
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,1,"The movie is full of murders, tortures, and needless cruelty."
" Class act
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,9,"What you expect from Neeraj Pandey,Akki,Anupam Kher combo.. a masterpiece.
Akki and Anupan kher are amazing and the chemistry between them is to watch for in their mission to nab the terrorist
Rest of the cast did really well..Dany,KK Menon,Tapsee,Rana,Sushant to mention ..All were Brilliant..
Direction by neeraj is near to perfection..One of the best Indian thriller and ever made.."
" Perfect thriller
",2018-10-24 00:00:00,10,"No words for neeraj pandey ...
Amazing work Akshay, Danny & Anupam.At the beginning I was very skeptical, 2 hrs 36 mins film gasp emoticon OMG ....
So without a single second of boredom, when the film ends, now I feel like...
How did 2 hr 36 mins end so quickly? :) gasp emoticon OMG :)
Loosely based on Argo (2012) Movie, Our Baby Is a Gem.
If Argo can win Oscars,this deserves at least 10/10 rating :)"
" Gripping!
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,7,"This movie grabs the viewer from the get-go. There are cool action sequences, and terror plots and the good guy, played by Akshay Kumar, going after them, makes for a good cinematic adventure. Akshay Kumar again delivers a good movie and a great story. The name seems a little out of place at first but an explanation is soon given for it.There are twists and turns and every time the viewer is forced to gasp at the near captures. The supporting cast was good, though Tapsee Pannu looked a little uncomfortable at first. Kay Kay Menon paints a good picture as the villain and looks formidable. The script is the star of the film. The twists are further accentuated by the background music. Thankfully, no unnecessary songs in the film. A little lengthy and could have been edited better. Some cliches and the inspiration from certain Hollywood spy movies are evident. Anupam Kher's wig looked garish.Overall, a good movie. Anupam Kher and Akshay Kumar come together and create magic again. Deserves a watch."
" amazing
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,10,Very perfect movie for indian cbi and ats group. awesome
" A quintessential of quality team work in Bollywood!!
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,9,"If you are a fan of movies like Argo, 12 Angry Men, Where Eagles Dare and the like then this movie would certainly entertain you and even make feel proud, as others rightly pointed out, of the quality of editing, VFX, which was the catalyst in making the movie a Must Watch! Although debatable, it certainly can be considered as a milestone in Bollywood, for that was the kind commitment the crew of the film put in which was clearly visible in very scene.I loved the fighting sequence when Tapsee confronts the middlemen. It was soooooo good! She certainly has created a brand for herself with this movie.
The movie was practical in many terms, in aspects ranging from script to background music."
" Not so good as the ratings would have you believe
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,1,"I mean may be if i am an indian then i'd get it, the plot is the worst."
" Baby got something for you
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,10,"First thing Akshay Kumar is my favorite hero. No matter what i watch his every movie. But this review will not get affected by this.Director of Baby Neeraj Pandey have done amazing job in this movie, just watch it you will get it why i am saying this. Story of this movie is mix of Patriotism, Extremism, Politics and Sacrifice of our army and other forces. Movie is full of action pack scenes. This movie is one of the best movies in Bollywood, but didn't get that much popularity.If you want watch something interesting and want full entertainment just go for this movie. Characters of this movie, shows different faces of Patriotism. Its going to hard for you to understand what this movie wants to convey but i hope you will get it."
" Excellent movie ever made on how to deal with terrorists!!
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,10,This movie is simply masterpiece!What a great way to demonstrate the scourge of terrorism and how to deal with them. A class above the rest and very bold way to show the truth to the world about the ugly ways of terrorists!Must make more such movies!This movie has made Akshay Kumar immortal in Hindi cinema and as the most patriotic actor in Bollywood!
" Atrocious acting n pathetic film
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,1,"The story follows a team of fictional secret agents called Baby; which is a temporary task force headed by Feroz Khan (Danny Denzongpa) formed in response to the 2008 Mumbai attacks whose job is to find and eliminate terrorists who are planning attacks in India.While attempting to rescue a fellow Indian security agent in Turkey, Ajay Singh Rajput (Akshay Kumar) captures a traitor Jamal (Karan Anand) who formerly worked under Ajay and threatens to kill his family unless he gives them the information about their terror attack plans on India. Ajay is told about a terrorist plot to cause a bomb blast in a Delhi mall which he and Jai (Rana Daggubati) are able to prevent. In the process they learn that this was only the first, of a series of massive attacks that had been planned. Pakistan based terrorist mastermind, Maulana (Rasheed Naz), is causing trouble near the India-Pakistan border. He plans and executes a daring prison escape plan for Bilal (Kay Kay Menon)."
