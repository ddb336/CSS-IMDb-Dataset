" A majorly impaired miner movie
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,5,"The 33 was directed by Patricia Riggen, written by Mikko Alanne, Craig Borten, and Michael Thomas who adapt from a book by Hector Tobar, and stars Antonio Banderas, Lou Diamond Phillips, Mario Casas, Adriana Barraza, Rodrigo Santoro, Juliette Binoche, Gabriel Byrne, Bob Gunton, and James Brolin. It follows 33 Chilean miners and their rescuers as they work together to survive and escape a collapsed mine.The Plot: Riggen and the writers faced an uphill battle in trying to captivate audiences with a highly publicized story that culminated in an even more publicized outcome. Gold miners Mario (Banderas), Don (Phillips), Alex (Casas), and plenty more are heading down for a normal day of work; however, Don is privy to the fact that the mountain they're under is shifting; but no one else cares. There's quite a good disaster sequence when the mine inevitably collapses, and shortly after, the families; led by Marta (Barraza) and Maria (Binoche) of the miners show up to make noise. G-man Golborne (Santoro) is sent by President Pinera (Gunton) to surveille and Andre (Byrne) and his team are sent to drill down to get the men, as are other drilling companies, including one led by Hart (Brolin). Riggen does do a bit of deviating from reality for dramatic heft but mostly succeeds in providing the broad strokes of the operation, never particularly nailing one perspective over the other.The Characters: By virtue of the fact that there were 33 men trapped in the mine and dozens of others working on or involved with the rescue, the 33 narrows focus to only a few of the miners and a handful of outsiders. Mario is the most commanding of the bunch. Not in a bossy sense, but he's functionally the leader due to his military experience, rationing out the food and keeping infighting to a minimum. Don Lucho is shown to be more cautious and less inclined to move from the refuge where everyone resides. His arc is only going from blaming himself for not keeping his men safe as his foreman job would entail, to not blaming himself, which happens with little emphasis. Alex works the best for the story due to his refusal to know his unborn child's gender until he gets out, leaving himself an unanswered question to keep him going. Everyone else are template characters that go through motions and generic arcs that, while realistic, never feel more than merely functional.The Drama: Between drilling sequences and the numerous schmaltzy musical cues, the drama only really works in half measures. Because the characters are largely one-note and the effort is made to show all positions of the situation, leaving almost everyone undercooked, few of what should be touching moments hold water. Food inevitably runs out before any of the drills have reached the men, and there are some pretty good moments where the reality of the pain they're all about to feel is the focus, and one where Mario is given the key to the box of the food; but like the majority of the potential drama in the 33; it's brushed off to focus on the outside when the inside is much more interesting. A flip-floppy feeling is omnipresent because of the frequent shifts in focus, most notably involving the pseudo-exiling Mario is given and the breakdown in brotherhood that lasts for a few minutes; and Andre's order to give up that he immediately drops a couple scenes later. The story itself is sound, but the drama's mostly a wash.The Technics: It's mostly the script and tone that make the movie crumble. Riggen does try her hardest to give credit to everyone that deserves it (it really is an admirable effort) but juxtaposed with scenes that begin to show how the hardship affected the men, the story that should've focused more on a blame to forgiveness arc instead goes for heartstrings and throws off the whole thing. James Horner's penultimate score is very good but perhaps overused in tandem with the unfocused drama to wring tears out of the audience. It all sounds good but feels just slightly off.Those miners and the people that saved them surely deserve the credit this movie aspires to give them. And while the movie gets some good moments from the story, it mostly coasts of the goodwill towards the people instead of providing a truly compelling insight into just one facet of the event.59/100"
" Good movie
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed watching this true story about 33 Chilean miners trapped in a mine. It was a good story about resilience, the human spirit, and working together. I also loved the Elvis impersonator. Even though I knew they were going to be rescued, the story still kept me on the edge of my seat. The cast worked well together, and everything about this movie was well done. The mine scenes were riveting.*** out of ****."
" This is a the best film
",2020-09-08 00:00:00,9,"This film is better than anything films, I got a deep emotion in here, I cried in the last scene:'"
" fantastic musical score, human resilence, hope, surviving at any cost
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,9,"Those are all brief descriptions and well deserved. Despite against all the odds of poor country's resources, corrupt politics and poor mining conditions, there were individuals that cared enough and got the job done. They made a movie about it so we can all appreciate the story of such survival and passion for life encouraging us all to cherrish what really is important in life and be greateful to God for every day we are alive."
" A survival story
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,8,Based on a real disaster that occured in 2010 in San Jose Chile with the perfect acting of famous and non famous actors Shows the victory of hope and the small lives of mine workers. Unfortunately this is a very difficult job and there are many deaths stories in history about mine explosions. But this time death can wait!!!!!!
" Too messy to be emotional
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,4,"Maybe it's because I'm chilean and I watched the rescue as it happened, but this movie does not make it justice.It never conveys just how emotional the event really was.Even then, it's still a very messy film.
It's rushed, unfocused and the tone is all over the place.It hits all the beats of an emotional biopic, but there's no heart behind it.Antonio Banderas is really good though."
" (South America Chile B+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,9,"Even though you know that they all get out okay, this was still a nail biter, and as you watch while the days pass, you feel such sympathy for the men who lived through this terrible ordeal. The critics were nuts--this is a good movie, very well done! I remember this story so well and how sorry I felt for those men living through this waking nightmare situation. Thank God that they all got out alive!"
" I wanted to like it...
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,3,Well the movie was decent but did have some major issues. First was the over acting by the entire cast. My goodness they tried way to hard and in the end was not very believable. Then the worst aspect was the music. OMG it was so bad it ruined the movie for me. This movie was a tragedy... You would think the music throughout the movie would be somewhat dramatic. Not all happy and jovial. The person who did the score should never work in film again. It was that bad. I wanted to like it but the overacting and music sealed the deal for me... Both were way off target.
" Really good and inspirational
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,7,Shocking how 33 people survived 69 days I wouldn't be able to do that! Lots of wonderful people work together to help the minors which is glorious!
" Fantastic true story
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,8,"Some of the effects for this movie (early on) were pretty amazing. Amazing that the miners survived that cave in, and that in itself is a brilliant sequence. The movie, because of its story, is one that ultimately must be carried by the strength of the screenplay and the ability of its actors. There is a large cast, both up and down, and all perform magnificently. The script works well and there are numerous touching moments. Some of the Chilean culture comes through too, which greatly helped. The 33 is a fitting tribute to the courage and determination of good people coming together in a crisis."
" Bravery and courage
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,7,"The 33 is a good solid movie that displays deep level of emotion, bravery, and courage while faced with a desperate situation. I remember watching this story unfold on the news and it was gripping as just when all hope was seemingly lost, the miraculous happened. Antonio Banderas shines as a leader and somebody who helps others who reach breaking point and one of my main gripes is I would've preferred if The 33 was filmed in Spanish rather than English to give the movie a bit more of an authentic feel to it. Overall though it was a really good movie to watch and although quite long at just over 2 hours, it didn't feel like it."
" Worth a viewing
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,6,"Based on the true story of the mission to rescue 33 miners who were trapped in an underground mine In Chili for 69 days. Considering the source material this was actually a bit dry and slow going in parts. The cast is great and the families are included in the story as are the guys up top trying to find them but the actual story of the miners survival felt kinda glazed over.There were things that I remember unfolding in the news that were very interesting and they weren't included in the story here. The guy jogging, the prayer meetings, mostly we just saw fighting amongst the starving scared men. Still an incredible story. Worth a viewing."
" I love you, James Horner.
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,7,"Movie? Mmmm, good but not great.
Soundtrack? Breaks my peruvian/latin heart everytime I hear it. Just beautiful."
" terrible accent download subs for undertand
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,3,"The movie is ok, so so FX maybe a 2.5 from 5, production is ok, costumes are realistic, but one big thing, those actors speak fluent Spanish, they are Spanish speakers, and why they are talking in English?, their accent is terrible really terrible I have to download English subtitles to understand everything, really their accent is so bad, looks like nobody speaks English, for the rest is ok, I think was a huge mistake and this error destroy the whole movie,,,,sorry but in China they don't speak Russian in their movies...we are in 2019 and there are subs for every single movie, try for the next time"
" ""We are buried alive. That is the big deal.""
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,8,"Following a brief opening scene that offers some background into Chilean family life, the story jumps right into the tragedy that transfixed that nation and the world during the latter months of 2010. The event became an extraordinary exercise in patience and hope that the thirty three trapped miners below the Atacama Desert near the town of Copiapó would somehow make it out alive. This became one of the world's premier true survival stories, and the picture captures much of the angst of the trapped miners and those praying for their survival who form a community of hope above ground. Leading the cast are Antonio Banderas as self appointed leader of the Chilean miners, Mario Sepúlveda, and Lou Diamond Phillips as the conflicted foreman of the San Jose Mine team, Don Lucho. The ordeal is unveiled in chilling detail as their only avenues of escape are rendered impossible, while a food supply of three days is all that stands between the men and a slow death. Via careful and systematic rationing supervised by Mario, the trapped men make it for seventeen days before the refuge area they are sheltered in is breached by a drill team from above. From there on, the second phase of the rescue tests the talents of three engineering teams that attempt to reach the men with some means of conveyance to bring them to the surface. Those who followed this event in real time know the successful outcome of the story, and the movie is a tribute to the perseverance of each of the thirty three men who withstood the claustrophobia of their underground home for a total of sixty nine days. I have to chuckle a bit over the reviews on this board who state that the movie was good but it was too long. People, come on, how would you have handled the real life version that lasted for over two months?"
" Enjoyable and human survival story.
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,7,"I don't believe in reviewing over 10 pages, so here's my quick take on it...
I really enjoyed this film in general, I remember the story well because I'm an avid news reader, BUT.. .
Probably the biggest issue, (at least for me, and I'll leave the long-form reviewers write about the rest), was the casting. I found it incredibly cringe-worthy whenever Juliette Binoche was on screen, as if some tan makeup was going to make her Chilean, the Chilean Minister of Mining being a male model in his 20's, but most egregious of all was the godawful choice of Bog Gunton as president of Chile. Really??
We've all seen him in a dozen films and series playing the role of the power-hungry, overly ambitious and morally bankrupt politician, which he's always portrayed adequately but never amazing, but it was an incredible shame to cast him at all, never mind in the role of CHILEAN president!! It would take most viewers right out of the film, and especially make most cinephiles just cringe. I don't know what word would describe it better than that.
All that being said, it's a very enjoyable movie honouring the right kind of human cooperation and national effort. Too bad it was so much of a political stunt, without which opportunity the government of Chile would've let those miners die without batting an eye."
" Just not serious enough.
",2018-06-18 00:00:00,4,"Based on a true story about a mining disaster, I expected the film to be much more dramatic than this. The mountain collapse scene was awesome, but the rest of the film was not as intriguing. I wanted them to show more about the men's survival skills. I also found the music too lighthearted for the theme. I just didn't find the film serious enough considering the circumstances. Also, when the rescue mission finally broke through to them, why didn't they show the men's reaction on finally receiving food and water again? This was surely crucial to them. They received clean clothing, although this was never shown or mentioned, and some of the men then even wear jewelry? Why was this sent down to them?? The film turned comedy-ish in the final moments. So much so that I didn't even find it very eventful when they finally did make it back to the top. Also, why did none of the men show signs of time in terms of hair and beards? At day 50 most of them are cleanly shaven. Even if shaving accessories were supplied to them, would they really have felt the need to shave everyday? And by the time they were rescued their hair was the same length as it was on Day 1.I did enjoy seeing the original 33 at the end of the movie."
" Nobody is eating anybody
",2018-05-14 00:00:00,10,"The film is based on a true story that I believe most of us know the outcome. The first 10 minutes of the film show us the miners as a community, with gold mining the best gig in town. We get to meet a half dozen or so personalities before the ominous music plays and the film is divided into a surface and subsurface subplots. Antonio Banderas plays ""Super Mario"" the appointed leader who kept the group together and from killing each other, at least in the film version. Lou Diamond Phillips finally lands himself a respectable role as a safety engineer whose role is defined as making sure they get 250 tons of ore out a day.The film goes through the emotional high and lows as despair sets in Camp Hope, a tent community of the families outside of the fence. The film portrays the mining company as bad and the government as heroes whose hand is forced by public opinion. The film was made in English although there are newscasts and songs in Spanish.The film is over 2 hours long as we experience all the failed attempts at rescue. The end of the film shows us the actual miners, and to be honest, none of them looked like Antonio Banderas. The film is a drama. Don't expect an action flick.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity."
" Workable true story retelling
",2018-04-19 00:00:00,6,"THE 33 is a workable Chilean drama about the real-life disaster and rescue tale of the famous 33 miners who spent months trapped below ground after a cave-in. The recent story will be familiar to all of us who follow world news, which robs this tale of some of the suspense, but otherwise it's quite an efficient film. I don't think it will ever be a favourite, because not much actually happens after the initial disaster. A lot of time is spent on building conflict with the group, but generally everybody got on and nobody went crazy. I could have done without all of the sentiment and the family relationship material which only serves to slow things down quite considerably. Still, a decent cast has been assembled here, including Antonio Banderas, James Brolin, Bob Gunton, and Lou Diamond Phillips, so it's worth a look."
" ""Deep Down Dark""
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,7,"In this true-life story, the title relates to the number of miners trapped in a copper mine in Chile, in 2010. It's a compelling premise. We feel for the miners in their small, claustrophobic hole some two thousand feet below the surface. And we empathize with anxious family and friends above ground who desperately want the men rescued.Based on the follow-up book ""Deep Down Dark"", the script has some problems. Characterization is minimal. Barely twenty minutes in, the mine's collapse supersedes characterization. If you're not familiar with the people by then, too bad; miners and their family members tend to take on a stick figure quality, one character pretty much blends in with some other character.English dialogue in a Spanish speaking country comes across as unrealistic. But much worse is the stilted, contrived nature of the chat; overwrought drama, anguish, arguing, and outward display of emotions reek of Hollywood talking, not the people who experienced this event. Despite the overly Hollywood feel to the script, the final twenty minutes are compelling and inspiring.Casting and acting are generally acceptable, except for the presence of Antonio Banderas in the lead role. As happens so often, Hollywood inserts big name actors into lead roles, which accentuates the Hollywood feel of a film, rendering the movie contrived. I would have preferred a lesser known actor.Background music consists of Spanish songs, which is nice. Color cinematography does a nice job in a low-light environment. Some segments in Act II could have been excised or shortened, as they either slow down the plot or they convey the impression of filler.The main reason to see this film is because of its real-life premise. The event really happened. How that event was handled by different characters, and the emotions it evoked during a span of many days is what gives the film its potency, a flawed movie script notwithstanding."
" Outstanding movie (feel good, funny, dramatic)
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,9,"This is actually a VERY good movie. I am not sure how accurate it is, but it does tell the story very well. There are no surprises, since most people remember when this happened. It just tells a story of survival. It is well acted, well directed, and the story (I think) is pretty accurate, at least from what I remember from when it happened. If you have not seen this movie, I would highly recommend it."
" Awesome film
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,10,"I found this film riveting in content, excellent in acting and direction, and one of the top five films I've seen in the past year or so. Simply put, it was such a well done movie. I cannot pretend to claim how close to factual the details may be, but every emotion imaginable is affected during the course of the film. Joy, sadness, humor, sympathy. Locate a dictionary, look up the word 'emotion', and follow the list. Without a doubt, worth all ten stars."
" It was really good!
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,8,"The film The 33 directed by Patricia Riggen depicts the events of a mining incident that happened on August 10, 2010 in . The day started just as every normal mining day did, the 33 men suited up for work, got into their bus that shuttled them down 1,700 feet and got to mining. However, in an instant, disaster struck. The mountain in which they were mining collapsed around them, leaving them stranded with minimal food and water. The movie unfolds by describing the living conditions in which they must adapt to in the 69 days the men are buried. The movie also includes the efforts in which the Chilean government took to save the men, how the families strong and never lost hope that their loved ones were going to make it out alive, and the heartfelt, much anticipated rescue that ensued on October 13, 2010, almost 3 months later to the day. The film itself was extremely well down. The 33 stayed true to the actual events that took place, while also keeping the movie suspenseful as well as entertaining. The film did not seem to drag or get boring, despite the fact that being enclosed in a mine for over 3 months couldn't be very eventful. The viewer was constantly left eager to see what was going to happen. Were the miners going to be rescued? Will they starve before help arrives? Is the government going to give up on them? All of these thoughts race through the audience's head leaving them starving for answers. The director of this film, Patricia Riggens does a beautiful job in making the film both entertaining and realistic. Riggens is a Mexican film director who has won numerous awards for her work such as an ALMA Award for Special Achievement. Her credentials for making this film are good. Riggens has directed other popular films such as the Disney classic Lemonade Mouth in 2011 as well as Revolucion, another historical film which describes how the Mexican Revolution affects Mexico today. The movie also contained a 26 million dollar budget (US dollars), which is low for the national budget, however even with the relatively low budget, the film still has an authentic feel and is, in my opinion, very well done. The majority of The 33 was filmed salt mine of Nemocón, Colombia. Since the set actually took place in a mine, it brings the feel ad accuracy of the movie to another level. The viewer gets a taste of being stranded almost two thousand feet underground. When questioned, Riggens stated how directing The 33 was liberating for her since it was such a rough and traumatic event. She feels being able to tackle and create such a movie as a women is a step in the right direction. The overall goal of this film was to educate the world about the terrifying events that took place in a Chilean mine on August 10, 2010. The film was most likely made for the survivors of this incident and to honor how heroic they were as people. The director made sure of this by including the final scene in which the original 33 are together again, smiling and laughing portraying the bond they formed during their 69 days together underground. The film also was probably made to inspire and give the message of perseverance to its audience. When watching The 33, you can't help but to feel compelled to act as the survivors and keep going through the obstacles in life. The film itself held pretty true to the actual story of The 33 men buried alive. There were however, some small errors that took place throughout the movie. For example, there was one scene in which the drill finally breaks through the rock and into the area in which the miners are trapped, the movie shows a stream of light flood into the room, where as in reality there is no way that the sunlight could be seen from that far down. Also, the film states that the first man rescued is a miner named Alex Vega, however in reality the actual first miner saved was a man named Florencio Antonio Avalos Silva at 12:11 on October 13, 2010. After being rescued, the film also shows the miners running into the arms of loved ones, when actually upon rescue, the men were immediately shuttled to the hospital for medical care. Since the film stayed fairly close to the true story, it didn't really contain any biased views. Overall, this historical film was very well done. The actors played very true to their parts, making what they were going through very believable. The filmmaking and directing style also aided to the success of this film, by using dark, somber lighting and dramatic scenes such as when the mine first collapses it creates a suspenseful, informative, but yet entertaining feel. Everything dialogue and setting related seemed pretty true to what actually happened as well, another plus. The only thing that I wish I could change was the things that didn't stay true to what really happened. All in all, I liked this film and therefore would give it a eight out of 10, only losing two points for the occasional historical inaccuracy. I still thoroughly enjoyed The 33 and would recommend it."
" May Contain Spoiler
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,10,"The film The 33 is based of a true story, directed by Patricia Riggen. The film is about 33 miners getting trapped after the mountain clasps on the workers and the efforts to rescue them. The 33 was created to provide a better understanding of what happened the the miners and what they went through during their time underground. Also, it is told from the miners views. Important people in the film are Mario Sepúlveda played by Antonio Banderas, Laurence Goldborne played by Rodrigo Santoro, Alex Vega played Mario Casas, Luis Urzua played by Lou Diamond Phillips, Darío Segovia played by Juan Pablo Rada, Andre Sougarret played by Gabriel Byrne, Edison Peña played by Jacob Vargas, and Yonni Barrios played by Oscar Nunez. Two out of the nine movies Patricia Riggen created were for a historical purpose where the other seven were created for entertainment purposes. The movie was filmed in the salt mine of Colombia, and in Tierra Amailla, Chile. The movie was created in 2014, with a budget of 26 million dollars. But it was not released until 2015. The 33 was created to share with the world what happened to these men and how everyone helped to save them. This film was created for a variety of people because they want others to know their story. The viewer doesn't have to dig to find an underlying meaning to the film. There are no factual or historical errors in the film. Patricia Riggen doesn't omit or ignore important topics. She interviewed all 33 miners before making the film. The film is not biased and the way the story is told is not biased. The characters in the film are believable, the dialogue seems appropriate for the time and setting of the film."
" The dramatic true event that happened in the San Jose mine. The 33.
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,9,"The 33 ReviewIn 2010, 33 miners were trapped nearly a half mile underground in the San Jose Mine that has been operational since 1889. The 33 men were without contact from the outside world for about two weeks with limited food and water. The 33 is a great movie for a dramatization of the historical events that happened in Chile. The special effect were were very realistic.The director of the movie was Patricia Riggen who is known for her movie Under the Same Moon and Lemonade Mouth. She was definitely qualified to make this movie because she has experience working for one of the biggest movie companies Disney. Patricia Riggen had a budget of 26 million dollars to make this movie and it was spent properly. It was filmed in two mines in Colombia and some scenes were shot in Chile. This is good because it uses the actual setting of the true event in the movie. This movie is pretty straight forward for the audience to understand what it is about. The point of the movie is stated in the trailers and descriptions, as well as in the movie itself. This movie was made for the United States since there were plenty of commercials and trailers released in the United States. Also it was made for Chile since this is where the real events take place. The 33 miners that were stuck underground watched the movie as well alongside the actors that portrayed themselves in the movie. I feel that this movie did a great job with the actors emotions. When the actual survivors watched it, I can only imagine how they felt thinking back on the event. Since this movie is based on history, it is important that it is historically accurate and true. One example of an inaccuracy is the drills that left the scene due to accidents and damages. The true event actually kept another drill drilling as a backup in case the United States drill plan did not work. Another inaccuracy of the movie, is how close the family members actual were to the rescue hole. In the movie, it shows them crowded around the hole some what close, but in reality the family members and journalists were about ninety meters away on a wooden platform. Another thing that was not in the film was how the miners were airlifted to a hospital as soon as they were brought up to the surface. Therefore the scene where the miner reunites with his sister would not have happened. I think this is an important topic that was omitted because it does not show how much danger the miners were still in once they reached ground level. This movie also seems to have some biases because it makes the United States look the best and get all the glory of the rescue because every other country left. Also it targets the Bolivian in the movie, so the viewers can guess it made for more of a Chilean audience. However this bias does not get in the way of telling the historical event the right way. Viewers still get a great representation of what happened in real life. Overall this film was properly made. The sets that they used looked realistic and believable considering they did shoot the film in a mine in Columbia. The special effects that they used did look as if a real mine was collapsing. Also, the characters that this film used were believable because they acted the part; meaning they looked and acted as if they were starving, going crazy, or at the brink of dying. The language that the characters used seemed appropriate for the situation they were in as well as the time period. Although this film was remarkably made, I think that there are some areas to improve on. Just to name one, I think they should have showed the airlifts to the hospital that happened in real life. Also real life footage could have been useful for the movie. This would get some personal emotion to some viewers so they can look at in a different way than just another movie. Another thing they could have added was a few scenes showing what the miners might have done once they got out of the mine a few later. In conclusion, The 33 was a great film that gives a great representation of what happened to the miners in the San Jose mine a half mile into the ground for 69 days in Chile."
" An Emotional Roller coaster
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,9,"In 2010, the unthinkable happened. 33 miners were trapped in an unstable mine for 69 days. In the beginning of the film the 33 miners go into the mine thinking it is an ordinary day mining for gold, but it soon turns out for the worst. The mine begins to collapse and everyone panics. They drove to the refuge, which was a safe space where there is food and water. For 14 days they were low on food and everyone was restless. Finally, the people that were up top trying to get the miners drilled into the refuge and could finally communicate to the miners. They sent food, drinks, iPod, and magazines to the miners to keep them occupied. The people on top said it would take 3 months to extract the miners. They ran into difficulties, but in the end all 33 miners were saved. The director of the film is Patricia Riggen. She went to Columbia University and received her masters in screen writing and directing. She was asked to direct a Disney Channel original movie Lemonade Mouth and also Girl in Progress releasing in 2012. Then her next project was The 33. The movie was released in August 2015, 5 years after the accident, in Chile. While directing this film she wanted the cast and crew to get the full experience on what these miners through. So, her cast and crew spent a total of 35 days filming in salt mines. Some of the desert scenes were in Chile and two mine scenes where in Columbia. She wanted to show that a girl can direct a movie that is so masculine. The next movie that she did was Miracles of Heaven. The theme of these movies is to not give up hope and keeping going. Patricia Riggen made this film to remember the accident and the pride that Chile has to keep going. She wanted to show what the miners actually went through because many people don't know the hardships those men went through. The reasons for the film is explicitly stated because the miners are stuck in a cave and they struggle. They don't give up hope and try to survive with little help and while the supplies were low. It was until the workers got to the miners that the struggle and hardships were real. The miners had little food everyday and it was getting to a time where the miners were going at each other. But, the character Mario kept everyone in line until help arrived. This film was made for the world because this was a live event that was on TV and not many people understood why this happened or what is happening. In the movie they showed why they were stuck and the problems on why they couldn't get them out. Now they showed what happened people know what it is like. There are many historical errors in this film. During the drilling of the rescue. The movie said that 2 drills broke down and couldn't help anymore. In the real event the drills were still working, but they were back up drills on the side for if anything happened to the main drill. Also, the 33 men after they got rescued were taken to the hospital right after and the movie said that they walked around and stayed with the families. Also, the mine afterwards closed after the event. The director does not omit important topics of this film and does a very good job going through the event. It is somewhat biased because it shows the mine is a bad guy in the film and that the President of Chile does really nothing to this event in his own country. He biased things does not get in the way of the film because they don't focus on those points and the story moves along. The characters are believable because they showed raw emotional when they were stuck in the mine and even when they were reunited with their families. The acting is really good and the language was appropriate for this time period. The language was somewhat Spanish and many spoke in English, but with a Spanish accent. Some ways to improve it is to get rid of biased and focus on the story. Also, when the mine was going to collapse it was hard to follow who was who, and where the refuge was. The setting was dark and even though they had lamp lights, they didn't use them. Some parts the miners had background light even though they were really far underground. Overall, this movie was really good and the event was on point with the acting and the emotional feeling of this film."
" I enjoyed this film and it kept in interested. Very inspirational!!!
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,9,"The film ""the 33"" is a very inspirational film that causes viewers to feel inspired when the film is over. The main plot is 33 miners getting stuck in a mine for almost 2 months, with very little hope to survive. Nobody had ever pulled off a miracle like this before, and many believe, with such an unstable mine, this was an impossible mission as well. Even families knew, they can try to hope, but they even admitted to this ""never being okay"" because they got the feeling they would never see their family or friends again. They went weeks without knowing whether they were even alive or not. I really liked the theme and suspense of the film, as well as the outcome and main plot. This is a very touching and inspiring film. The filmmaking process seemed precise and careful. The mine looked real, and so did the top of the mine with medical areas and temporary camps for families. It all seemed real and accurate. It could've been better with real footage, but was otherwise still good budget and film quality. The director has 12 awards, including 3 from ""the 33"". This is her only non-fiction historical film, but still has a lot of credentials as a director. She did a very good job on directing this movie and i did not spot any mistakes in the film besides having light come through a drilled hole that saved the miners, a light would not be seen from that far down, which may have been a symbol for hope and life.The reasons for making this film is the theme of the story, which is never give up and miracles do happen. The whole movie is made up to seem this is impossible with less than 1% chance they will survive. They use musical suspense to create doubt, as long as negative dialogue from the mining company and families, when they give up hope a lot. Only the government, especially Lawrence, is optimistic they will get the miners out. He did not want to ever give up on the miners or their families. He understands the significance of the situation. This movie is meant to downgrade the mining company and show strength to the Chilean government for always showing signs of hope, when everybody else had none. The film is made for the families and anybody who needs inspiration. It can be seen by noticing all the conflicting music and sounds they use, making us think it is impossible for all 33 to survive, and using effects to back it up, to create doubt and drama. They do this so when they all survive, that we realize what their intentions are, to inspire us that if this 1% chance of saving all these people who have been buried for months, can then anything is possible.The only sign of inaccurate historical events is that the drills that ""broke"" were working but kept as a backup. Other than that, the film was historically accurate. The director did well with keeping with the important theme and topic, and never got side tracked. The only noticeable biases is that the director seems to feel that the accident was the mining company's fault, showing a scene where the owner would not shut it down when a problem when it was brought to his attention that the mountain was shifting too much and was set up to fall any day. The director placed the blame on the mining company and made the Chilean government seem to have done it all. There is another scene where the mining company wanted to suspend the search for the miners, claiming saving them would be impossible. The biases did not get in the way of telling the story, as the outcome was the same in the movie as it really happened, the miners were saved and the Chilean government was to praise for that.This film is a very intriguing film and keeps interest. The acting is well and characters are believable. The dialogue and accent are right on, but they would not speak English in real life like they did in the movie, however, i liked that so i did not have to read every subtitle. The film may have been better if they had real footage and if all the events that happened were 100% accurate, but they did a very good job and kept me interested the whole time."
" Good Movie
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,7,"The 33 is a film based on a true story, where 33 Chilean miners get trapped underground in the San Jose mine for 69 days. The film shows the hardships the miners had to go through in the mine, as well as what people on the surface did to try to get them out. The film was a good film overall that did a good job showing the history behind the story of the miners, and it did a good job being entertaining and keeping the viewer hooked throughout the film. The director of the film is Patricia Riggen, who has made a few movies before, but nothing really historically based like The 33. This makes her somewhat not qualified to make a movie like this. The budget of the film was about 26 million dollars, which is quite a lot of money for a movie like this. The movie was released in 2015 and made 24.9 million dollars at the box office. More than half of the filming was done in the salt mine of Nemocón, Colombia, and rescue scenes were being filmed in Tierra Amarilla, Chile, so it has a very accurate portrayal of the mine, since it was filmed in an actual mine. The director most likely wanted to make the film to tell the story of the 33 Chilean miners, and the efforts to try to get them out of the mine they were trapped in. The film seemed like it was made for anyone looking for a dramatic movie to watch, not just Chilean people, so it was made to appeal to the masses.The film was very historically accurate. The only type of inaccuracy was the light shining through into the refuge when the first drill poked through. This would not happen considering they are hundreds of feet underground, and the drill is even blocking the hole it went through. Other than that, the director does not seem to have any bias, so it does not get in the way of the film as a whole.The film was very educational, but it was not boring. It is a very good tool to teach people what happened to the miners, and the characters seem to be very close to what they were like in real life. If I were directing this film, I would have tried to do more to make the audience feel how long the miners were in the mine for, because to the watcher, the fast paced sequences outside the mine takes away from the 69 day length of time."
" Worth it is you like a good story
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,7,"Half a mile under the earth surface, darkness all around, starvation on your mind, what do you do? Persevere. This is what 33 men of the San Jose Mining Company did from September to November as they were trapped with little food, water, or oxygen in an unstable mine. Based on true events, Patricia Riggen directs the film telling how the 33 miners were isolated from the outside world, stuck deep below ground for 69 days. Although filmed mostly in Colombia during 2014, this daring tale tells of the actual events played out at the San Jose copper-gold mine in Copiapo, Chile during 2010.Director Riggen wanted to tell the tale and heroics of the incident from the miner's view, while also getting the point across that not giving up on hope and surviving for your loved ones can push you to persevere through life's toughest issues. The film accurately portrays the historical events that unfolded, giving a somewhat day by day view on what happened. Since this is an actual event, the film was made to show the incident and how the miners were rescued. When it comes to the history, the film does an alright job being on target. It shows how difficult it was for the miners to survive in a small area with little water, and the toll it took on their family members going without contact for two weeks. The rescue scene was the most fabricated. In the movie it shows over a thousand family members, friends, and news reporters gathered close to the rescue hole. In reality, no one was allowed close to the rescue area. All reporters and most family members were forced to view the spectacle far away. Also, the drilling process in the movie had some Hollywood twists. Although there were three plans set out to get to the miners, from Australia, Canada, and the United States, the reality wasn't how the movie portrayed it. The film shows the Australian and Canadian crews practically giving up after some hiccups, and the US' drill getting right to business and eventually finding the miners. The American drill was first to reach them, but the other drills still continued to work in case of another setback. This shows some bias to the US. Unlike the movie, the miners were immediately rushed to nearby hospitals after being rescued, and had to wear sunglasses for several days for them to readjust.Overall, the movie is a great way to tell the story, with minimal errors. The actors did a great job being real and showing what it was like to be trapped down there. The camera angles needed to be more up close and personal, to really show how how dehydrated and hungry the miners were after the many days they were down there. A more surreal and jaw dropping image of what it's like to go without clean air, water, or food would have made it much better."
" great film
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,7,"Looking for any good movies to watch? Well, you are in luck! The movie, The 33, directed by Patricia Riggen, is based on a historical event. The movie is based in Chile and thirtythree miners were trapped in a gold mine for sixtynine days. The movie is overall a good film and shows history through an effective way.The filmmaking process of this movie began in December 2013 in Columbia. To make sure, Riggen got all the history correct, she interviewed each of the miners and their families. The filming was wrapped up on February 20, 2014. The major actors were Antonio Banderas who played ""Super"" Mario Sepúlveda, Rodrigo Santoro who played Laurence Golborne, Juliette Binoche played the strong female role, Gabriel Byrne's role was the engineer who rescued all thirtythree miners, and Chile's president was Sebastian Pinera. Patricia Riggen created many films such as Lemonade Mouth (2011), Perfect Target (1997), and Under the Same Moon (2007). The movie budget was 26 million USD. This film was filmed in Columbia, Copiapo, Chile, and Tierra Amarilla, Chile. The director, Patricia Riggen, says that she directed this movie because she wanted to challenge herself. She also said that she wanted to discover what the movie was really about. The reasons for this film are explicitly stated. It was a very easy film to follow and it kept the viewer's attention. This movie was created for the thirty three miners that survived the collapse of the mine; the movie made the survivors feel appreciated and loved.One of the movie's historical error was when the drill bar first came through, they spray painted it red and taped a letter to it. The history states that they wrote a note with red letters saying that everyone was alive. There were only small historical errors in the film. The director omits the important topics. Some of those important topics were the first time the drill came through, the plan to rescue the miners, and the execution of the rescue. The film did not seem biased. Overall, this movie was great! The actors were good and there was a lot of information given from watching. The characters are believable, everything looks real. The dialogue is appropriate for the time period, they had ipods, facetiming abilities, etc. Even though the film was realistic, there was a few scenes it seemed unrealistic. For example, when the drill came through for the first time there was light coming through. I would definitely recommend seeing this historical film."
" The 33 is a Great movie that showed the miners traped in the mine for 69 days
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,7,"We all remember 7 years ago when The Miners in the San Jose mine were trapped? Do you remember how they got out of there? This movie The 33 has a great way of showing of what happened in all 69 days the 33 miners were trapped in the mine. The movie budget for the 33 was $26 billion. It was lower than most Hollywood movies but it managed to do a good job telling a story. The editing and acting is good. This story was meant for the people who like history and meant to teal the story of the 33 miners who got trapped. The director also wrote other movies like Under the Same moon which is about a young Mexican boy traveling to the U.S after his grandmother died. This movie did have some goofs and errors. They also did not show what really happened at the end. Before they got rescued they sent Navy Seals in order to check on the men's health and conditions and securing the miners in the capsule. They also did not show the miners wearing safety goggles which was for protection against UV. The miners had to wear them while they were in the mine. The Navy Seals where one of the most important things at the end. In conclusion, the characters were believable. Mario Sepullveda was the character who kept the group together and gave the group hope. Lou Diamond Phillips was the character who was concerned about the mines safety and was shot down by the manager. The family's reaction were also believable because they were concerned about the miners. I like the movie but in my opinion i think they should of showed the navy seals at the end."
" An interesting, dynamic, yet factual film
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,8,"Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to be trapped in mine; away from everyone you have ever loved? In this suspenseful film named ""The 33"", 33 miners go to mine for gold near the Atacama Desert when suddenly they find themselves all trapped where there is minimal food or water barely enough to survive for 3 days. The families of the miners become emotional and demand answers from the mining company, however the mining company is very vague and has practically given up on finding the miners. Fortunately a man named Laurence Golborne takes over the rescue efforts, joins with the government, and ultimately saves all 33 miners in 69 days. The movie was extremely entertaining and kept you on the edge of your seat, however the historical aspect seems to be a secondary aspect.The director of ""The 33"", Patricia Riggen, began her directing career since 1997 in which she was a secondary assistant director. Her big break began when she directed her first major film named ""Under the Same Moon"", and began to continue directing successful movies such as ""Lemonade Mouth"" and ""Girl in Progress"". As you can see, she is very skilled at directing dramatic, fictional films; which makes it more likely to believe that many of the scenes of ""The 33"" are over dramatized for entertainment purposes for her demographic audience. The movie was released in 2015, only 5 years after the actual San Jose Mine accident, and was filmed in Colombia, Chile, and the United States, so although some scenes may be more dramatized for ratings, Patricia Riggen made her film somewhat recently after the incident and brought the biography to life by shooting in the actual countries that were affected by the tragedy.Patricia Riggen's reasoning for making the film was to show how brave the 33 men were and how their families in Chile were affected by the possible and assumed probable loss of their husband, brother, or father. She also has made it very clear that she blames the mining company for the accident and does not give the president the credit for saving the men due to their presented lack of interest or interest solely to save themselves. The message of the film is very clear because the director did an outstanding job on presenting emotion and facial expressions throughout every single character, no matter a lead or in the background. The audience that this was intended for was Chilean citizens who either experienced or had a huge impact on the original incident since it not only shows how the 33 men were struggling on how they would survive, but showed the numerous amounts of citizens that were in panicking in fear because they believed that their loved ones would never make it out alive.Although there was no prior research before watching the film, I have done some additional research afterwards and there seems no to be no historical accuracies. The most important topics such as the mine trapping the 33 men and how the Chile and other countries were affected by the tragedy were all covered and displayed excellently, however there is a bit of bias. The bias blames the mining company and somewhat looks down upon President Piñera for his supposed selfishness in the matter, and although their portrayal may be accurate there should have been more scenes of the mining company and Piñera explaining their side of the situation or showing how this truly impacted them as a person rather than a corporation. However, the minor bias in the film does not take away from the overall focus of the bravery of the 33 men trapped in the cave and the path to their survival.In conclusion, this film was very exciting to watch. The characters did an outstanding job with their emotion and their dialogue; almost making you feel like this film actually took place during the real mining accident in 2010. The filming style was amazing and showed many different angles and different viewpoints between Laurence Golborne's dedication for finding and saving the men and the citizens fear and coming together to help save their loved ones. The director took an actual historical event, and made it a very pleasurable film that is all interesting, dynamic, and factual; a desired combination of a historical based film."
" The 33
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,6,"The 33 movie review The film ""The 33"" is about the 33 miners that got trapped in a Chilean mine and how two men never stopped believing that they could be rescued. It's crazy to think that those miners were trapped in that mine for sixty nine days. Yes, sixty nine days. Its incredible true story. Its also a pretty good film as well. The director of this movie is Patricia Riggen. The budget for this movie was $26 million and the box office ended up being almost $25 million. It was released on November 9th, 2015. Its DVD release was February 16th, 2016. Patricia Riggen flew out to meet the actual miners before this movie was filmed and just spent a lot of time with them hearing all their stories. They shot this film in two real mines both located in Columbia. She convinced the actual miners to come at the end of the movie to have a big dinner on the beach and to show the audience what the real miners looked like and that they actually all survived. This movie is actually pretty historically correct. Not a lot wrong with it at all. I think the director did a solid job of touching up on most of the topics regarding the Chilean mine incident. It didn't seem to biased by any means. Regardless of if their is any biased thoughts in this film or not, it doesn't affect how Patricia Riggen tells the story. The characters bare based on real people so i'm just going to say that yes they are believable. Dialogue and other things surrounding the film seem realistic and nothing really seems off. The only real thing I don't like is that they call this a action drama biography. I don't really see how its considered action to be honest. Like when I think of action I think of stuff exploding and crazy fights and stuff like that. Overall, i enjoyed this film which i didn't think I was going to. I would give it 6 stars out of ten."
" I hear Bolivians taste like chicken
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,9,"The 33 Film Review The 33 was one of the better movies based off true stories that i have seen this year. The story of the 33 is one of perseverance, hope and sheer will. 33 miners became trapped in a mine over 700 meters below the ground. There is little hope that they will be rescued, because no miners trapped in a collapse have ever been saved. However, a new minister hears of the collapse and will not stand idle by as they die. He travels to the site of the collapse and demands that they attempt to rescue the miners, as well as offer all the resources the government can supply. This leads to the miners finally being rescued after almost 70 days.The director, Patricia Riggen, does a very good job of illustrating what happened to those 33 miners as they were trapped. Riggen as a director has been all over the place with the types of movies she's directed. She has went from romances to teen drama comedies. Then she made this intense very emotional and action feeling film. Despite the limited experience in this style of film, the quality did not suffer. The budget for this film was $26 million and it shows. Real equipment and sets that look real because the were added to the realism of the movie. Most of the scenes in the mine were filmed in a mine in colombia. The rest of the other scenes were actually filmed in chile.The film obviously was targeted at a specific group of people. The mining industry was made out to look negative in the movie, by letting the miners work in unsafe conditions and risk being trapped or killed.this is the second recent movie that targeted large companies for putting their workers in danger. This makes it quite obvious that the director and people involved in the movie were not fond of the greedy owners of mining companies. Especially the ones that put their workers in direct danger because of the risk of losing money. This film in my opinion was very accurate in the information used for the film, because of the facts that the miners the movie is based off of are still alive, this gave the filmmakers a very reliable source. Some scenes are dramatized or fabricated to add to the intensity, but overall the realism in this movie remains unencumbered. All in all this movie was exciting to watch while also being very informative and sends out the message that the filmmakers wanted to convey. The director never got too extravagant with the special effects and also still made it fun to watch. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested and a good, informative film."
" Well made and uplifting true story
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,8,The Chilean mine collapse in 2010 garnered worldwide coverage and it didn't take long for a film of the drama to be put in production. Many real life drama's fail to do justice to the subject matter but this one does a pretty good job. There is only so much you can do with these stories of entombment so there isn't much here you won't have seen before. Thankfully this one doesn't just concentrate on those trapped but also those above which keeps the film moving along nicely.The filming is impressive and the script is pretty decent. Throw in a few famous faces like Antonio Banderas and Lou Diamond Phillips and you have the building blocks of a good movie. It is maybe a touch overlong which does lead to a few flat spots but these are forgivable.This an uplifting and at times very emotional drama that highlights the depths of human spirit in adversity. Well worth watching.
