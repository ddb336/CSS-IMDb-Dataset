" Great
",2021-04-01 00:00:00,8,'Holding the Man' includes heart-wrenching performances and centres around an achingly beautiful portrayal of love.
" Best of all Time
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,10,"This is I think, the best Australian film I have seen. What a rollercoaster of emotion. I am so disappointed that I have only just stumbled across this film. What is wrong in our country that this has not had more publicity. This should be shown in all Australian High Schools."
" Yet another depressive gay tragedy
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,1,"Some of my thoughts about this movie:* Yet another depressive gay tragedy like almost every other gay themed movie i've ever seen.
* It's time we get uplifting movies where the character just happens to be gay, rather than the gay having to be highlighted like ---->this is the gay one!!! See how gay he is!!! He ticks all the boxes! Look at the tragedy of his life!<----.
* It'd be good if gay couples aren't always dealt with differently from anyone else in a relationship. ALL relationships require self-sacrifice, work, open hearted conversations, a sharing of feelings, changes to routine, accepting the relationship isn't about ""me me me!"" and honest self-questioning to work.
* Being gay and in a relationship is not all about washboard stomachs, looking hot, lots of partners and constant self-gratification. If it's about those things for you, that's YOUR choice to make it about those things and has nothing to do with you being gay.
* Life isn't always a tragedy just because you're gay.
* In basically every 'gay themed' movie I've seen there's the same recurring themes as if you're bound to come across these things just because you're gay.
* There's more to life than making it all about your sexual preference.
* Being gay doesn't always mean:
you shy away from your own masculinity and start acting girlie;that your life is a tragedy;that you are destined to never have a proper loving relationship;that you have to be an activist;that it's you pitted against the ""non-gay"" world."
" Great film
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,9,It does touch on some aspects of growing up during the 1970's & 80's! It does a beautiful job with love and undefined relationship problems! Bravo!
" Sadder than I expected.
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,7,"Very well acted and tightly directed. Unfortunately a bit melodramatic at times, and it's fairly sexually explicit. Overall, a pretty good film, but do I dare to say, I've seen it before, the general theme of aids?"
" The best movie I have ever watched
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,10,"This movie is the greatest and best movie I have ever watched, it was sad, happy, funny, all of the emotions. The storyline is amazing. I'm a fan of queer movies but this one is my favorite and I have watched many. This movie made me sob and smile at the same time. It reminds of Call me by your name and Maurice, many of those queer romance forbidden love movies. Also the fact that it's a true story makes it's even better. The time and setting is amazing, having it be during the AIDS epidemic and then in a very non-supportive place with non-supportive catholic parents. This movie made me feel stuff I have never felt before. The characters and story made me feel like I was there and could relate to them. Best movie I have ever watched."
" Old Men in Bad Wigs?
",2020-09-08 00:00:00,4,"I was told this movie is great and I finally got around to watching it. I don't know what happened! I couldn't make it past the half hour mark. I really wanted to give it a chance but it just wasn't working at all for me. I was expecting to witness some kind of gay classic but it felt totally odd and wrong to me. Now that I think about it, I shouldn't be surprised that my ex enjoyed a film like this - given his questionable taste in cinema.The main thing for me was that the two lead actors just look WAY too old to be playing high school boys. Combine that fact with incredibly awful hairstyles and mediocre acting and the whole thing just comes off as ridiculous and comical. I honestly think this was miscast from the get go. I couldn't stop thinking that Tim comes across as a kind of perverse Willy Wonka figure with John as the innocent child being lured into the factory for candy.The film probably develops into something more but I'm afraid the characters just were not established well enough for me to be invested in their arcs. Such a shame and I'm honestly shocked! I'll give it a 4 just based on the assumption that it gets better in the second half of the film."
" Beautiful
",2020-09-08 00:00:00,10,"Loved this, great heart connection, loved the guys, the soundtrack the script, lack of cliche melodrama, perfect"
" Apart from some reservations still impressive, especially in the second half.
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,7,"I never read the book, but I am convinced of it's sincerity - how could I not, the writer apparently wrote down his own beautiful but tragic love-story, just days before he himself died. The result is an equally sincere and emotional movie with some impressive acting. But looking at the movie objectively, without the hindsight of knowing it's origin, I also have some reservations.For one, I am a bit frustrated to see yet another movie where the LGBT-community is pictured as drenched in misery, rejection, sickness, death and buckets of tears, due to bigotry, discrimination and AIDS. Wouldn't it be nice for a change to see how out-off all these difficulties something strong and positive would rise up. Alas not so here, so to me seeing this ""Holding the Man"" felt like having to do some steps back in time.Another reservation concerns the fact that the actors play both the teenage and the adult versions of their characters. Maybe the producers supposed that the public couldn't handle different actors playing the same character, but the result is extremely awkward: giving two 25+ actors a silly hair-do and let them behave like madcap teens (especially Ryan Corr) was a big let-down to me, and a huge distraction from the actual story that was told. In a movie like Moonlight they even used three different actors for the the same character and it didn't harm it a bit.To me the movie got better and more realistic in the second half, especially the part where John's health deteriorated and Timothy had to cope with this. Especially the acting of Ryan Corr in that phase was impressive. Craig Matthew Stott had the disadvantage of his character being so sick that he hardly could express himself, but his afflicted appearance combined with his resigned attitude was heartbreaking.All in all: some serious reservations, but especially in the second half an emotionally impressive movie."
" Missing the magic of the book
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,6,"This was a decent movie, but doesn't really capture the full essence of the book. Perhaps with a bigger budget it could have used better locations to give us a better sense of the era, but it all feels a little flat. I adore the book and felt really connected to Tim and John while I was reading it, I feel that the documentary 'Remembering The Man' does a better job of giving that same feeling of connection."
" This is definitely 8.0-8.7
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,8,"I never read the book, so i don't know how to expect. I usually didn't give my review but this is touched my heart. Especially i watch this during 2020 worldwide pandemic. I discover this movie from Netflix. For me the set and everything is definitely perfect, the characters are also incredible. However there's something i don't really like, for the first hour i watch this movie i didn't click to the storyline and how everything goes. I feel that the transition is a little bit push and some stupid action that characters did are so unnecessary. Well the last hour of this movie is really something, i found the tears all over my face (especially after i know that this is the real story). Well despite anything that I've been said, this movie is pretty good."
" Impressive Adaptation of a Great Book
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,9,"I saw the movie before I read the book, but I must say I am equally impressed by both. I loved the blunt honesty of the book, but what impressed me most about the film were the performances by Ryan Corr and Craig Matthew Stott. As Tim and John, their chemistry is spot on. There is heft, believability and passion in all of their scenes together. The supporting cast, which features some well known faces from Australian TV and cinema are fine, but they are basically relegated to the background. I loved Corr and Stott in their scenes together and wanted it to go on forever; knowing how tragically it all ends made it even sadder. I would put this film in the same category as BRIEF ENCOUNTER in terms of its romantic content. The fact that it is a true story makes it even better - and more poignant."
" Thoughtful and Passionate.
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,9,"A heart wrenching, beautiful film about the first wave of the AIDS epidemic. Carefully and intelligently directed with a great cast and script.I did get a bit lost on the chronology, despite the year flashes on screen and I am still unsure where their original virus came from. I suppose the idea was that you didn't know who was 'to blame' for introducing it into the relationship.Lots of yummy bottoms on display and some other exciting moments, but actually the passion and the emotions were so perfectly portrayed that the film would have been amazing even without the titillation.I cried a lot, so have your tissues handy and maybe take some to bed with you later too."
" SO BEAUTIFUL
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,9,"This was one of the first ever gay movies I watched, It was amazing!! It made me feel so many emotions... I recommend this movie if you like to see a gay couple movies that take you through a life journey, just be prepared to tear up a bit..."
" Very Well Written And Quite Emotional!
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,9,"SPOILERS. DO NOT READ UNTIL YOU WATCH THE MOVIE FIRST!This is a great coming of age movie that my husband and myself watched and both felt extremely grateful to have each other in a monogamous relationship. I don't know if we would have been able to celebrate 21yrs together if we hadn't been looking for a long term relationship with another person. It's almost exactly like life was like during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. It's just a story that you want to stop watching, however you can't stop watching. I have always been critical of most gay genre films as they seem to either run out of money or they end without a proper explanation of what just happened. It's very common for a good film to just end and leave the viewer thinking,"" what the hell just happened?""This isn't one of those films. It is extremely hard to watch and it leaves most people, well at least my husband and myself , feeling very depressed about what we just watched! It's what makes this movie so well made. It tells the story of a couple who meet at college and they become more than just friends, one of them gets the opportunity of a lifetime to travel to Sydney and work in his dream job in theatre. While one is off having a life changing career, the other is waiting back home for his lover and partner to return. It's set in the early years of the AIDS epidemic and the partner who peruses his career also peruses his sexual desires and is infected by the devastating epidemic. He then unknowingly brings it back home to his partner, who seems to have a quicker reaction to the virus as he ends up in the hospital and very sick much faster than his partner who infects him while being promiscuous in Sydney. Now, both are infected with the virus and the parents of the son who stayed at home while his partner was pursuing his career, become very defensive of their son. They try to stop him from receiving visits from the lover whom infected him and it gets worse with each passing day. It's just like the real way people acted during the time of the epidemic. It's quite an accurate depiction of how many people responded when this terrible virus was first starting to show up in many hospitals. Everything finally comes to a point where the son dies first and it's not going to be much longer before the partner himself will die. He starts getting Symptoms that lead you to know he doesn't have much time left himself. We watched this film because of a friend who recommended it to us, but we had no idea how it would end. It was rather disturbing as we both felt lucky to be alive and to have lived through this time period where people were dying all over the country. It's not just a gay disease now in the modern world, it's everyone's disease. It's a disease that is now treatable, for most people, however there are options now that didn't exist in the period of this movie. This was a death sentence when this film is suppose to take place.This is a great movie, but it's hard to watch, the music is incredible and it's from my time period, but its a heartbreaking experience and it left both my husband and myself feel very depressed as we watched this and we both thought to ourselves, that could have been one of us. It's why we both we're looking for a monogamous relationship when we found each other. We've both been tested and we've been together for 21yrs. It's just unbelievable that 21yrs has passed by in the blink of an eye. It just proves how short and precious life is , especially when you share it with the love of your life.I think it's a movie every gay man should watch and if you lived during the time period of this film, you should be extremely thankful that you didn't catch this terrible virus before they had medication to make life better if you did get this terrible virus. Even with the new medications they have to fight this virus, not everyone can handle the side effects that they cause , so safe sex should still be practiced!"
" Amazing
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,10,"Very touching, a must see. This film tells the story in a beautiful way."
" My heart hurts
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,9,"This is a truly moving and engaging film. But be warned, the end is emotionally devastating. I was a wreck for days after watching."
" Why?
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,6,"Why does every gay movie have to end in tragedy? I wanted to enjoy the progression of the love story, but I could tell by the first scene that at least one of the characters were going to die at the end and I'm sorry but that just ruins the whole story."
" As candid a story of love and tragedy as you will ever see...
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,7,"Based on a true story; this is a touching and moving story of a couple of young Australian men who fall in love as youngsters in the days before there was any AIDS awareness. Ryan Corr (""Tim"") and Craig Matthew Scott (""Tom"") are superb as they act out their joyous loving relationship (complete with it's obligatory ups and downs) and then have to face the fact that, 15 years later, one has become terminally ill. We share the traumatic journey, poignantly told as they both try to reconcile themselves to the inevitable. Guy Pearce and Geoffrey Rush star too and Anthony LaPaglia and Camilla Ah Kin play ""John""'s parents sensitively - their grief compounded by their perception of the blame lying on his ""choices"". It is raw and at times horrible to watch - the decline is pretty full-on but none the less watchable and engrossing for that. It's seems odd now that this was an unstoppable disease, but for many of us who were young in the 1970s and 1980s this was just how it happened. The lack of legal status of the partner in the whole process is sickening but thankfully, for many, long changed for the better."
" Holding the Man Review
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,6,It's shocking how little I cared about either of the two main characters. The movie definitely could have been shorter.
" Amazing Surprise
",2019-04-13 00:00:00,8,"I admit, I was rather apprehensive to watch this movie because I knew it would not be easy since the subject matter was quite obviously not about entertaining but rather tackling a difficult subject matter. And so I waited for a long time before getting the courage to sit down and experience the story which is very strong and absolutely touching.I'm not particularly fond of flashbacks in movies because they tend to be used as gimmicks and we need as viewers a proper clue that what we are seeing is in a different time frame. But I shouldn't have worried since the movie was directed and edited by people who know their craft and they were able to construct a beautiful love story.The 2 leads are absolutely amazing and the acting is very strong from the whole cast so it was a pleasure to get into the story which, although difficult and certainly very sad, was also uplifting and amazingly well crafted. I particularly enjoyed Ryan Corr portrayal of the conceited, arrogant yet loving Timothy Conigrave character and he is lifting the movie to a higher plane full of pathos and subtleties.Craig Matthew Stott as Conigrave's lover John Caleo is also very good with a subtle performance and his chemistry with Timothy is really strong. The ending which is always a sore subject for me when not done right was actually satisfying even if I knew that it couldn't be anything but sad yet, there is a quality to the script that makes it uplifting and very touching.A solid 8 stars from me is well deserved and I would totally recommend it to anyone who is interested in this subject matter yet, be aware that this is no picnic in the park but a difficult yet inspiring journey into the romantic bond between 2 men who we feel truly love each other until the end."
" No words to say
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,10,"I am just as speechless as I guess the audiences would have been after watching the movie. I probably haven't cried this much since my boyfriend passed away because of AIDS as I did today. Tim & John are a wonderful couple. The days, months, years they spent together, the ups & downs they went through and finally the last days of John with Tim was heart-wrenching. I don't have words to express my feelings and thoughts. I just want to thank Neil Armfield to have made such a wonderful movie and to all it's cast and crew. I couldn't stop myself from giving a review to this movie. I think it's not justifiable that this movie has earned 7.3/10 wherein it should be a 10/10.Kudos to everyone.
Cheers!!!"
" Outstanding!
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,10,"I read the book many years ago, but it has taken me a long time to watch the movie - I loved the book SO much, I didn't want to be disappointed.I needn't have worried, because the movie is absolutely outstanding! Beautifully acted by the entire cast, poignant, and yes, incredibly sad. I'm still crying 30 mins after finishing it.It's not an easy movie to watch, but it's so very worth it. Australian cinema at it's finest!"
" Excellent Film
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,9,From the writing to the actors. Every scene was perfectly shot the actors were real and I thought I was standing next to them listening to their story. Well done to all of you. It was a pleasure to watch. Thank you.
" Best Gay movie
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,10,This is awesome. Great movie! Acting was very good..
" Book's better but still touching
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,6,"As with most films adapted from the book, you'll only get half the story in a movie. The acting is superb and the story relatively faithful to the original novel but it has some flaws. Namely, I found the mixing up of dates confusing. They didn't really need to jump back and forwards, I'm not sure why they did that. There is a lot of sex with spunky guys which will get on the wrong side of any homophobes or the conservatives but it is a neccessary part of the story as it depicts a lot of how the gay male community interacts (I'm gay, I can vouch for this). Ultimately it ends in tragedy and is quite a moving film but having been one of my favourite books, I will always prefer that to this."
" Best Aussie Film I've Ever Seen
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,10,Wow. I was captivated by this film the entire time. The acting is superb and the story is heart wrenching. Literally never written a review before but was compelled to because it was so good.
" Dear God this movie kicks in
",2018-10-25 00:00:00,10,"What a wonderful movie this was. It really kept me silent for a while. Great actors, great soundtrack, 'wonderful' story. Wow. Just Wow."
" Wonderful
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,10,The best movie i have seen. I am glad that i saw this movie everything about it was so great. I felt for characters.
" Too painful
",2018-06-18 00:00:00,10,"I should have remembered that a movie which opens with a scene from Romeo and Juliet is not going to leave me feeling light and happy. Holding the Man lived up to the expectation.In the sphere of tragedy amidst love I choose to not watch or ready anymore. Too many people I've loved are now dead. I am now in the green room so to speak, although I hope my call to my final performance is years away. Nevertheless I my mind now includes the deceased names of people I've loved or at least liked but are no longer here in bodily form.Watching Holding the Man did not lighten that load any. Hell, it may have added some weight.That is what is damnable about this movie. It does not let up. It's trajectory of love finding its own level is frustrating at times but seems to be clear. Cupids arrow is direct and the love between these boys is direct. Parents get in the way but they find their way. That's great and leads me to think this will be a movie with a happy ending.Then the scene. Our first introduction to AIDS in the movie suddenly shifts the direction of what could have been a pleasant train ride. The train hit a switch which sends the train, John and Tim and us in a very different direction. A direction I wish it did not go.Do I sound like Debbie Downer? Let's just say that the movie is so well done that it carried me through several emotions (including the ""Don't do that, you'll be discovered"" sort of emotion). Then it rides into the tragedy that AIDS through into our lives. The inevitable, unfair, unjust crime of nature against humanity.Include the awful scene of John's memorial service where Tim sits in a row with everyone else, and where the priest expresses gratitude to Tim and another friend for being with John during his last few months.I could not help but want to stand in that church and scream at the priest, ""F#% liar!"" I really wish someone did. But that apparently did not happen.It did make me realize that religions such as Catholicism are still babies where the real world is concerned. As an institution its leadership are adults who refuse to grow up and deal with reality. Not to neglect when religious groups stand against evil in the world. But where sexuality is concerned so many religious remain children. They are incompetent to dealing with matters of sexuality.Don't know if or when I can watch this film again. It is just too painful to know that such beautiful, Heavenly blessed love between two boys who grow into men, who still love each other in ways that religious folks often can only fantasize about, were removed from this life so quickly and so easily.A beautiful, lovely movie. There were times when I was wondering where it was going. The length is a bit much. But for excellent story telling, using the power of film this movie deserves a rating of 10."
" Extremely touching
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,10,Had no expectations and was deeply moved by the extraordinary play of the leading actors.
" The biggest emotional impact from a movie
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,10,"I actually watched this film about 2 months ago, but I still remember it vividly. Reading the book in a week after watching the movie also ensured that my life for the next month was going to be a roller-coaster of emotions. This movie will make you cry, a lot!The thing I adore about Holding the man is how Corr and Stott played their characters so well and fittingly to the real Tim and John in the book- it makes the film as a whole so much more engaging and heart-breaking. The movie's actual love story context is SO much more than just a love story. From protesting homophobia to harrowing encounters with disease and how it can effect a relationship, Holding The Man features so much that by the end of the movie, you will feel like you've gone through something... beautifully tragic. I honestly felt depressed for a solid 2 weeks after watching this film. This is perhaps a reason why I should give this movie a 9 star rating instead of 10, but I just can't! Months on from watching the film, John and Tim do still occasionally crop into my mind; but not in a sad, melancholy way, but in a peaceful way. The film made me care for these men I've never met. Something no other film apart from Brokeback Mountain made me do.I recommend this movie so highly if you love an epic love story that actually is so much more than that. It's beautiful and happy and exciting and sad and horrible all in one! I love it so much."
" Gayman becomes author tell's all made into dull badly made film
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,1,There are a lot of these gay author tells all/life story made into a movie films. They are popular at film festivals and win all kinds of awards there. I have yet to see a good one. I stopped watching this movie after about a half hour... so the film failed with me. I didn't care for either actor but especially not Ryan Corr (playing Tim Coragrave). 30 year olds playing teenagers usually doesn't work..and especially the way this thing was directed and acted. Tim Coragrave looks like some sort of mean queen (not that bad but almost) -- John Caleo (actor Craig Scott) is basically boring.Look there are certain parts of middle class growing up gay that I don't want to relive over and over or even see them in film except maybe briefly to set the stage... For one thing most of it was boring and the gay stuff humiliating. These are painful or embarrassing memories you want to mostly forget.This film should have been heavily edited. Also a more honest story would have helped ...Caleo as captain of the football team?--gay fantasy time here. The supporting actors especially Corgrave's parents were almost comically bad. So ho hum...Popular cliché ideas of glamorous lives (authors models etc..) make for mostly silly dull movies...Full of predictable icons heros and melodrama. Tim Corgrave becomes a writer(pseudointellectual fodder)...unfortunately a bad one I might add.I googled and this film unbelievably won all kinds of awards. Gay parts have become mainline any more so hopefully this sort of PC false accolade will stop.AVOID
" When everything is against you
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,9,"I wasn't searching for a movie about aids. The subject usually gives me a very uneasy feeling. I don't want to remember those days when some very good friends of mine died in agony in front of my eyes. I was quite young back then, and did I really understand what happened? No, when you're young life looks endless. So when this movie, unexpectedly for me, because I had not read anything about it, brought up the aids subject, I had to take a deep breath. But the movie is so well executed that it is much more than an aids drama. This movie is a piece of human history and every high school student should see it. I am in my 50s and now aids is something of the past, thanks to great medicine. It cuts through my heart that young men like ones in this film had no chance at all. Especially in the 80s gay liberation wasn't that far, and so much human needs have been denied to these men. Thank god society has improved on these levels, and it only could by telling these important stories."
