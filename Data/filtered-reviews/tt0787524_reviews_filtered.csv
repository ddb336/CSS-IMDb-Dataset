" Best Movie I have ever seen
",2021-04-06 00:00:00,10,"Wonderful movie, Great acting by actor's, family movie,
If your subject is science then you must watch this movieüëç"
" Sad story of an amazing man
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,10,"This movie will make you cry. The thoughtless way this poor man was treated by Englishmen destroyed his life. His mother did the same to his wife. Dev Patel is outstanding as the mathematical genius who persisted in spite of racism, poverty & separation from the woman he loved. Based on a true story of a remarkable person who died way too soon."
" Beautiful film
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,8,"Jeremy Irons shines in a temperamental role that has you reeling, but believing the whole way. Patel is solid as the lead, but feels on rails at times. Great liberties were taken in the actual story but I feel they align well with the story form. You certainly walk away with the tragic loss of an extraordinary mind, who with little education and in an incredibly short time had a profound effect on mathematics."
" Dev patel startling
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,10,"Dev patel just rules this movie. Such an enormous screen presence. Jeremy Irons is delightful also. Lots of English restraint. And his character softens and grows through the picture, shaped by The charisma of Patel, or the character he plays, they seem inseperable. Movies of intense bright flames that die too soon always get to me, as this one does. A Ten for the tears."
" A worthy attempt at depicting the work and hardship of one of the greatest mathematicians
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,8,"Dev Patel does a splendid job in portraying a young Srinivasa Ramanujan, striving to be recognised in an unfriendly and discriminatory world. Fortunately, Jeremy Irons as G.H. Hardy and John Littlewood are there to aid him in his quest for success.Overall, the film was focused more on the struggles of young Srinivasa Ramanujan, rather than at his pure genius. Sir Ramanujan was what many would call 'gifted'. Through his devotion, he was enlightened with beautiful mathematical equations and representations. The movie could have centred more on his work and knowledge, rather than mainly on his climb to success. Regardless, it was an enjoyable movie, and left me with a sense of remorse for the late Ramanujan's early death."
" The Man Who Knew Infinity
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,9,"If you found it interesting Hardy's view of the mathematical world and the rigour he asked Ramanujan to have. I highly recommend you read is book "" A Mathematician's Apology"" it is said to be one of the best books for people who are not mathematicians to better understand the mathematical world. Overall the book gives a better view of this movie and how much Hardy influenced the world and Cambridge and some of the dialogue with other Fellow's. This movie gives and excellent view of the life that there was in Cambridge back in that time which made many people go to Oxford (Hardy being one of them). The movie goes in slow pace which in my view it is correct because in the academic world some thing will take a lot of time just to prove a small thing or even a big one and how hard it was for Ramanujan to be accepted in the academic life being he a genius of his own right but people found his potencial very late in life unlike some of the examples they give along the movie like Newton or Jacobi or Euler.For students who love mathematics and they are thinking in following a math carrer this movie gives a tiny view of the rigorous world it is in mathematics."
" Best of the biopics
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,9,"Not many know about the great Indian mathematician S Ramanujan and this movie is exactly for them. And its for those too who know him and wish to discover more about him, his devotion towards God, his endeavours in England and how he cracked the Partitions and got the FRS!!
Dev Patel is as brilliant and looks just as intelligent for the role and Jeremy Irons has done a fabulous job too.
I say this is best of the biopics because it has just the right amount of elements of everything a biopic should have. Not much drama- more reality - real life like conversations."
" ""An equation has no meaning to me...unless it expresses a thought of God""
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,7,"I guess the phrase sums the whole movie - aimed to bring to public eye the figure of a brilliant mind largely unknown ( outside of the Mathematics world I suppose). The phrase clarifies the whole modern polemics on the topic of the opposition between religion/faith and science and it is not coincidentally that it is expressed through the mouth and figure and life of an Indian (brahman) - the highest spiritual authority in one of the few traditional societies left at the time of the action ( early 20th century). Science, as well as art or any other activity of the man is only valuable if it is an act of inspiration."
" Great movie and it must be 9
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,10,Absolutely great movie and best biopic I have erver seen
" An amazing movie.
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,10,"Please don't miss this movie.
The movie is based on the great Indian mathematician Shree nivasi ramanujan and his journey in mathematics.
The shows his mathematics intelligence and struggle."
" Wasting time
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,6,Good story but ruined it directing was missed in this movie and acting not emotional so bad
" Life of an Determined Genius
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,8,"I am interested in the lives of such geniuses, it is a lesson for people. We have seen how bad people can be. We have seen how much minor deficiencies can wear a person. We have seen what an ignorant parent can cause.Although the film was slow, the messages were very good. Although there are many mathematical terms, you can watch the movie without getting bored. Themself emphasizes British racism, which sees them superior. It reveals the struggle against perseverance against people who say that someone who is not one of them will never achieve anything. Even if you struggle with the disease, if you are miles away from your loved ones, it is an example of a struggle that is given tirelessly.Although the film started stagnant, it recovered with its end. The story of a man trying to prove himself and his truths against a group that saw themselves superior during the First World War is told. Ramanujan's mother is also a separate character. She was the pure woman, the humorous element of the movie. The trailing grass scene, Hardy's last speech, was fantastic. A genius who made the name Ramanujan in history with its formulas."
" beautiful movie about math genius
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,5,"I've also seen the disappointingly poor biography of Stephen Hawking and
this biography is much better."
" PROUD INDIAN MATHEMATICS KING LIFE STORY
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,9,"When it comes to acting Dev Patel is Picasso of it. Not only Dev patel, but every character in this film just nailed it. This film is the life story of the great Srinivasana Ramanujan and his struggle to be the outstanding mathematician of his time inspite of all the hardships. He can Visualize formulas being roaming here and there when he close his eyes. i Guess thats the difference between a great and a greatest. The most interesting part is he created the magical equation that was used by the great stephen hawking to reveal the secrets of black-hole. A must watch film for all."
" Great Knowledge comes from the Humblest of Origin
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,8,"The man who knew Infinity is a biographical drama movie directed by Matthew Brown and stars Dev Patel, Jeremy Irons, Devika Bhise, Toby Jones, Stephen Fry, Kevin McNally and Dhritiman Chatterjee.The movie is based on the life of the Indian Mathematician Wizard Late Srinivasa Ramanujan.It's good to see that producers are nowadays focusing on the legends who somewhat didn't get the recognition they deserved.The movie is nicely paced with some intelligent casting. The acting is the one of the strongest asset of the movie. Screenplay is evenly paced. The movie looks very close to the reality and is inspiring. The movie is enjoyable as well as gripping.The movie must be seen by the viewers who loves biographical movies."
" Limitless
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,8,"I remember seeing a quote by S. Ramanujan. I'm an individual who loves quotes and people's stories.So, after having S. Ramanujan's quote implanted in my mind, I went down a rabbit hole of researching more about him.Eventually, I came across ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"". I remember immediately marking it down to watch. And when I watched it a couple days later, it amazed me so much.What this man did, compared to where he came from, was inspiring to say the least."
" A must watch life story of the Indian mathematics wizard.
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,9,"One of the main aspects of this film is the brilliant acting of each and every character shown in the film. Dev Patel is as always nailed the role of Srinivasana Ramanujan. All the professors seeing him as an outcast except G.H.Hardy and Longbottom. This film depicts the struggle of S. Ramanujan and his hardships in a different country which on his time was considered to be forbidden land as Brahmans of that time believed that travelling through the sea is not to be done by them. He rose to those superstitions and all other who didn't believed in him. And finally with the help of G.H.Hardy landed on his famous equation which gave him and the movie it's title ""The Man who Knew Infinity""
In conclusion I would say seat tight to watch the journey of the magical equations which later used by Stephen Hawking for unraveling the mysteries of the black-hole."
" Splendid portrayal of a genius and a friendship
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,9,"My Review - The Man Who Knew Infinity my Rating 9/10This film I hadn't heard of till today and in my opinion it fits beautifully in a trio of movies about Great mathematical geniuses The Theory of Everything 2014 about Stephen Hawking ,The Imitation Game 2014 about Alan Turing .
The Man Who Knew Infinity filmed in 2015 is a splendid and moving film about the life and academic career of the pioneer Indian mathematician, Srinivasa Ramanujan, and his friendship with his mentor, Professor G.H. Hardy.
It's a factual account and a wonderful pairing of actors Dev Patel as Ramanujan a Mozart like short lived mathematician who leaves his poor home in Madras to join eccentric but brilliant
Professor Hardy ( played beautifully by Jeremy Irons) at Trinity College Cambridge to develop his computations. Many of G.H. Hardy's (Jeremy Irons) lines in the film (particularly in his opening monologue and his eulogy of Ramanujan) are taken word-for-word from Hardy's own writings.
A film about Maths geniuses may sound a bit boring and nerdy but there's so much more to this film.
Matt Brown who co wrote the script and directed this film which is set in 1910 has beautifully created a story of a man uprooted from his culture who leaves his wife behind and when he arrives at Cambridge is treated with scorn and racial intolerance.
Dev Patel and Jeremy Irons characters after the initial doubt by Professor Hardy of the young Srinivasa Ramanujan's stellar intelligence and boundless confidence both great minds blend to prove many complicated mathematical theories ?
But there's a price to pay of course when alienation and separation from culture and family occur.
I can't believe or understand why this film wasn't applauded or awarded in the same way The Theory of Everything or The Imitation Game was received in fact it barely made its production cost and Dev Patel only award was an insult a Yoga special award as Most Over Exposed Actor of 2017.
I highly recommend this movie there must have been a reason it was ignored and it certainly wasn't justified."
" Heart melting movie
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,7,"Wonderful performance by dev patel and the whole team, screenplay is very nice."
" A must watch movie by Matthew Brown
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,9,"The movie ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"" is written and directed by Matthew Brown which is purely based on the book by Robert Kanigel. It reveals the story of Srinivasa Ramanujan, an Indian Mathematician. Although he was college dropout, he didn't give up hope. He tried a lot to explore his mathematical knowledge towards the people who can understand what he really wanted to say.
According to me, the script is very authentic and it explains a lot about the time when Ramanujan was struggling to showcase his knowledge around the globe. He always explained that his knowledge is none other than God's saying. Movie reveals that he had a good relationship with the G.H. Hardy(renowned professor in Cambridge).
As far as the acting is concerned, Dev patel,a renowed artist, played the role of Srinivasa Ramanujan. This character is played very well. His wife's(Janaki) role is played by Devika Bhise. And the second most important character G.H. Hardy is played by Jeremy Irons, a renowed artist. There is a great connection between Ramanujan and professor Hardy.
In this movie we came to know that Ramanujan broke all the traditional rules of twentieth centurie's India and set sail for Britain. He left his orthodox family including mother and wife to go to Britain giving them his words to come back. He worked in England for 6 long years and a lot of things happened during that period. And eventually Ramanujan got the disease Tuberculosis. He was treated in England and got recovered. Finally he wanted to come back from England in 1920 and professor G.H. Hardy granted it. Ramanujan came back to India but won't live longer. He died at the very young age of 32. Ramanujan became the member of Royal Society of England at his last age with the help of professor G.H. Hardy.
Some may call this movie a blend, some may never listened about this movie. But according to me, it is the movie of inspiration of all times. There might be some flaws in acting, but it is altogether a very authentic and good movie.
Hence I will recommend to watch this movie by all the students to be inspired by this."
" A Must See.. Infinity Times
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,9,"First of all, a million thanks to the people involved in bringing this story for the world..Srinivasa Ramanujan is a legendary name in India. But the nuances and the struggles were unknown to most of us. And it is beautifully filmed & performed by all.Kudos Infinity!!"
" Motivational
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,10,Must watch movie. Thanks for the crew for making this movie. There are many emotional scenes which makes you cry.
" It gets you thinking !!
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,9,"This masterclass wasn't executed at its best but endowed a subtle embrace of proclivity and imagination. For the might of this man, left me spellbound on who he could do it. I ended up reading the entire wikepedia text of Ramanujam and how he really pulled that off and gets me to say, brilliant, unimaginable and out of this world."
" Ultimate
",2020-02-06 00:00:00,10,"Superb movie, unfortunately it was not made by Bollywood"
" Good but lacks plot
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,7,Good movie. Interesting and touching but it feels a little empty.
" U can't miss this
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,10,If u r an Indian.. And a maths lover... Shut all ur work.. And watch this.. One of the best movies.. directed and acted beautifully.
" Just wow
",2019-08-19 00:00:00,10,Excellent inspiring movie based on true events. A great mathematician from India.
" Wish Universities Required Professors know this film. Excellent Period Piece
",2019-08-05 00:00:00,10,"Very impressive film and true story.. The end of the film presents the raw facts that beg someone to make a film about such a brilliant mind, from very humble beginnings. REALLY NOW... the guy who figures out the math behind a blackhole died shortly after going to London.... The story is very believable for that time, yet shocking when the full genius is considered.... I have recommended this movie to many people and professors. Thank you fellow IMBD for giving this film a fair rating.... otherwise I would not have watched it.... and that would have been a real loss."
" Srinivasa Ramanujan is deserving of his place in the history books
",2019-07-06 00:00:00,6,"From humble beginnings Srinivasa Ramanujan knew he was destined for greatness if only given half a chance to prove his intellectual capabilities in the field of mathematics. Dev Patel does an extraordinary justice to the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan.At the turn of the 19th century, England's prestigious Trinity Cleege, University of Cambridge in England was the home of wealthy and influential scholars and the students came from mainly well to do backgrounds. After hearing (and subsequently reading) some of Srinivasa Ramanujan's intuitive mathematical theories, English mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England sent for him to come to England to study and prove his theories through the formal scientific methodology.Keep in mind that in the decade of 1910-1920 travel was by ship and the trip from India to England would not have been a very pleasant way to travel abroad. Srinivasa Ramanujan struggled at first at Cambidge feelinf isolated and alone after leaving behind his family in India, and being the victim of prejudice by the British subjects who looked down upon their Indian math wiz.This is a true story of hope, perserverance, and a man's unique genius in the field of math. It is a true story well worth watching and Dev Patel portrays Srinivasa Ramanujan with the utmost honesty and heart felt loyalty to his reliefs both in mathematics as well as his religion.A deserving 6 out of 10 rating"
" Dances with Numbers
",2019-05-17 00:00:00,8,"This is a biopic of Srinivasa Ramunujan. Admittedly I never heard of him until I saw this film. It was of no surprise that once again Dev Patel is the smallest man in all of India as Ben Kingsley is getting old. Ramunujan goes to England on the eve of WWI, armed with books of formulas of his own making with little formal education. He impresses some while he draws the ire of others because he is Indian.As a geek, I found the film interesting. Another great performance by Dev Patel.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity."
" Cringingly bad
",2019-04-26 00:00:00,4,"Every biopic seems to fall prey to some intrinsic flaw which dooms it to failure and The Man Who Knew Infinity is no exception. Perhaps it is that every man's life is so complex and multifaceted that the necessary simplification and abbreviation to fit within the scope of a motion picture inevitably invites crassness and phoniness. Yes this film is bad, and cringingly so. Characters are two-dimensional, themes are hackneyed, and sentimentality is rife. There is scarcely a fresh or original moment in it, only a a dire and inevitable predictability to the story. 99.999% of us, the audience, know far too little of mathematics to appreciate the importance of the hero's work. There is just no excitement there to lift the story. Actors Dev Patel, Jeremy Irons and their colleagues extract as much as possible from the material, and the cinematography is fine, otherwise, what can you say? It's well intentioned, except for the patronizing treatment of Indians, but sinks under its many failings."
" One of the Best Movies I've Ever Seen!
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,10,"""Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty..."" Bertrand Russell.Occasionally, we are reminded of the beauty that is inherent in the eternal. This is one of those movies that does that. I had not even heard of this movie, but only came across it 2 weeks ago while doing an unrelated Internet search. It's quite a shame that this is rated not even 2% higher than the utter s*** show that is ""Captain Marvel"", seeing as these works of art (and to call ""Captain Marvel"" a work of art is actually an insult to all art) - are not even in the same galaxy in their value. Yet, this movie won NO awards while the other scat production did. Upside down and soul-less.Watch this movie. You'll be glad you did. More importantly, it will beatify your existence."
" movie meant the world to me and hopefully a lot to the world
",2019-03-11 00:00:00,9,"I struggle with my rating here between a movie I would force down people's thoats (9 stars) or a movie a would strongly recommend and force down the throats of people with specific interests (in this case, mathematically inclined/scientific people - 8 stars - because maybe if you hated math you wouldn't appreciate the significance of this). What I arrived at was a 9/10 because Dev Patel does an absolutely amazing job here and I think the story is even MoRE important than Lion (also dev Patel). The basic gist here is protgonist, Ramanujan, is proving amazing things in math, under the tutaluge of a Cambridge professor and I mean EPIC things that scientists are still using for work on black holes today. Okay so nerdy-side bar, If you're into math but always hated proofs, you can identify with Ramanujan because he hates them too. He's brilliant and just knows things in math are true because...well he knows...despite being a poor chap from India with no means. He sends his proofs to a dude in UK who recognizes his awesomeness and brings him to Cambridge and well, this poor Indian man struggles to prove the very essesne of what he ""knows"" already to be true. The professor keeps insisting he prove concepts formally in proofs but we learn Ramanujan is sick and so he's rushing to leave as much legacy as he can before his time is up. Is this a nerdy math thing? Ya. - end side-bar**** But can anyone who's struggled through school or academia reciprocate? HELL YA. We've all been in that spot where we fail English, but love music. Or we love history, but suck at math. Ramanujan is brilliant at one side of math but struggles with the other side because, oh right! He was born poor and didn't have the same access to education. Most of us can't claim the same excuse, but even if we can, we are inspired because he fights through and ya there's all the stereotypical things too, like discrimination and all the homage to India-English tensions through colonialism, but what's most important here, is one man's will and maturity to leave a legacy behind which we probably didn't deserve (the mathematical gifts continue to be used in science today). So Dev Patel, f*#~ ya! This was beautiful and I cried a lot watching him eat his tony vegetarian meals and feeling all his hardships. The way he never sees his wife and family but gives this all-sacrificing gift to the world. The character conflicted by his choice of legacy over family and comfort, is a human concept that is complex and difficult to portray in cinema but done very well. Haven't seen it done this well since good will hunting. 9 stars!"
" A limitless mind
",2019-03-05 00:00:00,7,"Biopics have always interested me, regardless of whether liberties are taken with the facts (the case with quite a lot) many of them are very well made and fascinating while also featuring lead performances that do the subject in question justice. Srinivasa Ramanujan, his story and his ground-breaking contributions to mathematics also fascinate and worth telling and looking up, and it was great to have the opportunity to have them better known.Another selling point for me was Jeremy Irons, have always loved him if again more for his early work up to 'Lolita'. Although he is deservedly lauded by many, to me he is deserving of more credit, due to generally being restricted to (mostly) supporting roles in hit (this, 'The Borgias', 'Margin Call' and 'Henry IV' for examples) and miss ('Assassins Creed', 'Batman v Superman', 'The Time Machine', though he was among the better assets in all three, and especially 'Dungeons and Dragons' which is in every way indefensible) output since 'Lolita' that don't show his full talent, even when in a vast majority of them he is one of the bright spots, that people sometimes forget how brilliant a lot of his early work is. This does sound irrelevant, but it isn't really once saying what my thoughts on his performance here is and how it fares compared to his other work. Despite what 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' had going for it, part of me was not sure as to whether it would completely work for me, with Maths always having been one of my least favourite subjects in school. Never got my head around some of it and it didn't engage me as much as Music, History, English, French and German did, while always appreciating its importance and why it is considered a compulsory subject in primary and secondary schools up to A-Levels.On the most part, 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' was a winner and struck a chord with me. It is nowhere near close to flawless and it falls short of being a great film. It is though well-intended and earnest, that mostly compels and much of it well written and acted. Despite inaccuracies and what made Ramanujan's work so ground-breaking not delved into enough it does try to treat this remarkable man and his story respectfully and does well in making Maths interesting and accessible. Very like 'A Beautiful Mind', 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' helped make me appreciate Maths much more.Didn't find the scenes in Madras/India depicting Ramanujan's personal life anywhere near as interesting as the scenes in Cambridge and particularly the scenes between Ramanujan and Hardy, and to me they are the film's biggest fault. They are nicely filmed and the scenery is beautiful and it did show his motivations which was great. Unfortunately, they are also far too slow-paced (which hurt especially the first twenty five or so minutes when we don't see Hardy), mostly uneventful when the film is switching back and forth, contains very soapy writing, indifferent chemistry between Ramanujan and his wife and the acting has been described before as a mix of cold and exaggerated which sums it up very well.There are moments of less than elegant camera work, indicating some inexperience, where some shots are disappointingly out of focus in a way that makes one slightly queasy. Can understand the criticism of 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' not doing much new for the biopic genre and playing it too conventionally and safely, with an outcome that is foreseeable and slightly on the pat side. And as said, it could have delved more into what made Ramanujan's work so ground-breaking and focused less on his personal life.However, 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' does have quite a lot working in its favour. The photography is not consistent but quite a lot of it is nicely done and complements the beautifully evocatively rendered Indian landscapes and the authentic 1914 Cambridge setting very well. Trinity College is shown in all its glory, in both the exteriors and interiors it looks wonderful. The music may not stick in the head but it serves its purpose well, it's sympathetic, not too syrupy and it fits at least. Again, there is inconsistency in the direction, not always focused visually and very pedestrian in the scenes in Madras, but it helps make the story intriguing and accessible and is a triumph in the scenes between Ramanujan and Hardy (particularly in the latter stages), Hardy and Littlewood's scenes are also well done.Script is mostly intelligent and sincere, not being too wordy, too complicated, too treacly or overly simple. It is especially good in Hardy's dialogue and speeches which are beautifully written (especially the ""who are we to question the Ramanujan"" one). Irons' Shakespearean-like delivery in that wonderful unmistakable voice he has, that always makes things that are usually dull engaging, helps quite a bit. The story once it got going engaged, moved and inspired me, didn't understand all the maths but it still intrigued and illuminated me and found myself really caring and identifying with Ramanujan, rooting for his overcoming significant adversity. The chemistry between Ramanujan and Hardy is complex, never biased, intriguing to watch develop and heartfelt, it is the heart of the film and the driving force of the drama and one of the film's biggest strengths in that it rises the film above being completely routine. The characterisation of Hardy is similarly a triumph, a far more complex character that one seems to think when first introduced to him, the most developed (more so than Ramanujan himself and that is without seeing glimpses of his personal life really) and therefore the most interesting. Really appreciated how Ramanujan's adversity is not done in a way that was overdone or pantomimic, some of it having genuine tension, and also showing the harships England were going through at the time.Notwithstanding big reservations with how Ramanujan's family were characterised here, the acting is very good. Dev Patel may not look like Ramanujan, too young, too tall and too handsome, and may seem a miscast physically, but is still great in interpretation due to exuding more emotion, charm and passion than seen before from him by me and made me care and root for such a remarkable man. To me, this is one of his better performances and he works incredibly well with Irons, the complexities of the relationship between the two portrayed with nuance and passion. Their scenes in the second half of the film are particularly beautifully done and the ending is initially inspiring and then very touching in Hardy's tribute. Toby Jones is endearing as Littlewood and the British cast, including Anthony Calf and Jeremy Northam, are sterling and don't overplay or phone in. The acting honours though belong to Irons, who is absolutely outstanding here as Hardy and gives one of his best performances in one of not many roles in recent years to fully show how great an actor he truly is (he actually shows it in a vast majority of his work, just that too many times he is well above what he is given). Because there is a lot of meat to Hardy and Irons wrings every ounce of juice out of it without ever overplaying, his eyes, gestures and face telling so much in a remarkably subtle way, yes there is much more to Irons' appeal than his voice. It is an authoritative and sincere performance in a way that's powerfully understated, full of gravitas and never less than compelling, he brings an edge to Hardy while expertly softening it when needed in the emotional latter stages when he becomes more sympathetic. The lack of big awards attention for his performance here is in my mind criminal and like 'Dead Ringers' (except not as bad) all over again in that it was a big inexplicable oversight that year.Summarising, a well above average film though not flawless or great, though Trinity College, the chemistry between Patel and Irons and Irons' performance are massive assets and help make it a much better film. 7/10"
" Interesting but Miscasted
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,8,"It's good movie to watch, it shows the Indian relationship attachment, and it's complications too. Dev Patel is not at all suited for this character as his one dimensions expression continued in this movie also. They should have used any other Indian actors for lead role, that may give the justice to the character."
" A beautiful movie...
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,7,"""The Man Who Knew Infinity"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch the true story of the Indian mathematician, Srinivasa Ramanujan. His story starts in Mandras a city in India where he makes his first steps in mathematics while searching for a job and goes until he arrives in Cambridge and starts working there. He faces many difficulties and makes some friendships such as with Professor G.H. Hardy who was also his mentor.I liked this movie very much because it was a true story of a person who suffered a lot, facing any difficulties but eventually succeeded in his field. The direction which was made by Matt Brown was very good and I believe that the combination he made between the life of Srinivasa Ramanujan in India and what he sacrificed in order to go to England with the life that he was expecting before arriving in England and what he actually lived there was a very good idea. I enjoyed also the interpretation of Dev Patel who played as Srinivasa Ramanujan and for one more time, he was very good at it. Other interpretations that were very good and have to be mentioned are Jeremy Irons who played as Professor G.H. Hardy and Toby Jones who played as Littlewood.To sum up, I believe that ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"" is a beautiful movie with a great plot based on an incredible person and pioneer in mathematics. I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because it's a life lesson from which everybody will gain something by watching it. Never stop dreaming and never stop fighting for something you love."
" What an awesome biography!!
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,10,"This is not a biography but a inspiration. It could be said some are god gifted but no, it's what they do makes others think they are god gifted.An ultimate loss to the world. Watch the movie if you feel like alone."
" It's a half decent effort to make a Ramanujan biopic
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,6,You can watch it if you'd like to know about Ramanujan's life but the movie is focuses more on his struggle in life instead of focusing on the genius he was.

",2018-09-05 00:00:00,8,"We need more films like this. If A Beautiful Mind can win the Academy Award in 2001, then this film is certainly in that class, and equally as impressive. With shades of Good Will Hunting, but in a more serious vein (and unfortunately, a much lower box office potential), we have a film that renews our love and respect for truly superior academic accomplishment. It is not for everyone, but for those who believe that math is the ultimate truth of the universe, this film is like a religious experience. All the actors did a great job; particularly Patel and Irons. And the director was right on. A film not to be missed by youth and older adults alike."
" Worthy and fascinating biopic
",2018-07-25 00:00:00,9,"Srinivasa Ramanujan was the second Indian to become a Fellow of Britain's Royal Society. He was a child prodigy in a mathematics, and a prodigy and total genius in that field in general (possibly the greatest intuitive thinker in maths there ever was) , and he spent five years at Trinity College, Cambridge - the one that has more Nobel Prizes than France, the one where (the also relatively humble-backgrounded) Newton was a predecessor of Ramanujan's. This is an amazing story in and of itself, and of course it needs telling, but it has to be owned that the Ramanujan character - as played by ""Slumdog"" veteran Dev Patel - is not truly the star of this show, with that honour rather falling to Jeremy Irons, in the very rewarding role of Godfrey Hardy. Nevertheless, the interactions between the young Indian and the getting-on-a-bit Don are fascinating and authentic-looking and not stagey at all (ever a risk with biopics). The only slight problem is in respect of the ages (as the pair were only really separated by a 10-year age gap). Ramanujan is religious and feels his maths is a gift from the gods and doesn't feel the need to understand how his equations work, or how he gets to them, while Hardy - who can just about grasp his student's simpler work on a good day - is nevertheless a demander of proofs, of genuine academic working, and of the Cambridge Way. So Ramanujan cannot be recognised as a scientist unless he works to be one. This is a core of the film, and the formula repeats several times before progress finally begins to be depicted, albeit coinciding with a further deterioration in the Indian's already shaky state of health. The story is thus a winner (even if its mathematical content has no hope of getting through to any of the film's viewers), and all the more so as it plays out against the background of the start of the First World War. However, the joy here is in the nuanced performance of Irons and the lines he gets to deliver. A third member of the setup is the character of John Littlewood - very appealingly portrayed by Toby Jones. Jeremy Northam also does his usual sympathetic work as famous philosopher Bertrand Russell. The Director here is American Matthew Brown, who does remarkably well at feeling the Cambridge - and British - atmosphere. And while he pulls no punches in his portrayal of the shameful and un-Christian racism and bigotry and stereotypical thinking levelled against Ramanujan by many, he cannot help but make it clear that many Brits were supportive of the young genius from the outset, not least Hardy, Littlewood and Russell (as well as Micaiah Hill), while others - like Major Percy McMahon played here by the ever-effective Kevin McNally - were won over to his cause. Likewise, in India, the young talent did indeed receive backing from Anglo-Irish engineer Sir Francis Spring (here played by Stephen Fry). Prior to that, during his education at schools in India, Ramanujan had had access to pioneering textbooks written by leading mathematicians from Britain, while his abilities had been noted and fostered by Indian-based British mathematicians like Edgar Middlemast and Eric Neville. These days it is fashionable to suggest all empires were equally evil, and indeed that they were nothing but evil, and staffed solely by ruthless exploiters. Whether it wishes to or not ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"" - in telling a compelling true story with reasonable faithfulness - supplies a nuanced view on that..."

The movie tells about his journey on how he made everyone believe in what he believed,
A must watch movie for every researchers, academicians & Scholars!!"
" A thought provoking and troubling film
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,6,"This film saddened me as I could not help but think that Ramanujan and his family would have been happier if he had not come to the UK or at least had returned home much sooner. He received accolades for mathematics achievement and the film informs us he is considered with the highest regard in his field. But the sacrifice of family life seems too great, no matter the professional achievement. There was a sense that he was trapped in the U.K. rather than willingly remaining there. The film also tells us that Ramanujan found solutions to mathematics problems without being able to demonstrate how he reached the results. The reason he was able to do this is unclear for some time, but we are eventually told that it is divine intervention. That simply did not add up."
" Incredible
",2018-06-15 00:00:00,10,"Whilst the mathematical concepts were difficult to understand the movie was just incredible. This, without doubt, was the best performance I have ever seen of an actor. Jeremy Irons played the role of his life, and what a life and a career he has had. As for Dev Patel, I saw Lion first and thought he could never beat that performance but this was just something special. A truly remarkable and moving movie."
" Of Biopics and Hero Materials !
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,7,"The Man Who Knew Infinity - Although the scientist-as-superhero film genre is more than well-established by now through A Beautiful Mind, The Imitation Game and The Theory of Everything, This biopic of Srinivasa Ramanujan warrants a watch for the pure genius the leading man epitomized. A Fellow of the Royal Society and also Fellow of Trinity College - monumental attainments for an Indian with no formal training in mathematics - tips of the iceberg for the genius that Srinivasa Ramanujan was, the movie tries to capture his liaison with renowned mathematician G.H.Hardy and his life at the Cambridge university.The movie scores in its accurate rendering of the intellectual mathematics involved and the realities of academic antagonism; the historical and cultural skirmishes between Indian and English conducts and the side track of jingoists vs. pacifists. A Tamil movie with the same topic - Ramanujan was released one year earlier which dispensed more with the personal life and enlargement of the virtuoso.Having said that, Dev Patel was an out-and-out miscast for the role, given Ramanujan's short and stout physique and his Dravidian guises. Patel is sure a strange casting choice yet captures his appeal with integrity and passion and in some means, a heftier underdog akin to his breakout role in Slumdog Millionaire.Biopics in our country have apportioned mostly with sportsmen (Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, M.S.Dhoni, Mary Kom, Dangal, Paan Singh Tomar, Azhar) while undermining the scientists and intellectuals - it's a pity that we are still relishing on screen versions of delinquents like Gujarati Bootlegger Abdul Latif (Read Raees !) while the west is adapting our finer lives to silver screen !"
" Well Written, Well Done
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,8,"An excellent film with echoes of ""Amadeus"" where men marvel at the capacity for someone to create, without effort, that which only brilliance understands and comprehends. Instead of music, as was the case with ""Amadeus,"" this story is of mathematics and a man who could create formulas, without proof, knowing that what he created was correct. The proof came later and established as fact, a man's extreme intelligence. Well worth taking the time to see this film."
" Great biopic of Ramanujan, the Indian math genius
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,8,"6/5/16. Saw this in the theatre today. This is a wonderful biopic!!! It's about the famed Srinivasa Ramanujan who was a mathematical genius who could have been lost to obscurity had he not made the trip to Cambridge University. Under the tutelage of Hardy (Irons) he learned the importance of ""proving"" his intuitive knowledge of higher mathematics by putting in writing how he arrived as he many creative conclusions. Do not worry about the mathematics, you don't need to know it to understand the enormity of his genius. Patel and Irons were simply wonderful in their respective roles. The cinematography was wonderful, the screenplay exquisite. Did you know that the Indian Government declared December 22nd (Ramanujan's birthday) as National Mathematics Day in his honor? Don't miss this one!"
" A stroke of Luck salvages Ramunajan's genius from obscurity
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,8,"5/12/18. Saw this in the theater. An excellently made movie about the legendary Ramunajan, a dirt-poor brilliant math genius who just happened to have been lucky enough to be discovered and then tutored by a renown British academic, G.H. Hardy. This movie shows just how precarious genius is in a world where wealth and class (in colonial India), and how Ramunajan's contributions to mathematics could well have been lost to obscurity. Worth catching."
" Amazing
",2018-03-07 00:00:00,10,"When I first came upon this film I was unsure if it would be any good, but I was astonished just how good this movie was. The two lead actors in the movie,Dev Patel and Jeremy Irons were incredible together. Apparently the movie took some fictional license to other parts of Ramanujan life, but essentially the important aspect of this movie, is his work with Hardy and time at trinity. 
The powerful aspect of this movie lies behind the facts that the theories are still being proven a century after they were first foretold"
" A man's tryst with Genius
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,7,"The movie is about a Cambridge Mathematics Scholar G.H. Hardy's experience with the genius of S. Ramanujan, a self taught Indian Mathematician, who without any formal training went on to unravel complex theories of mathematics. The viewers get a glimpse of Ramanujan's background in colonial India where living in abject poverty, he is absolved in deriving answers to complex mathematical questions. In his town, he finds no one to understand his work and to earn a living starts working as an accounting clerk. As a stoke of luck, he gets guided to write a letter to a Cambridge scholar G.H. Hardy with his discoveries and G.H. Hardy gets responded back.
Thus starts the story of a partnership between Hardy and Ramanujan, where Hardy puts trust in Ramanujan and arranges for his travel and stay in Cambridge. It is a story of Hardy's partnership with Ramanujan and the opposition that he faces for his decision. Hardy's attempt to understand Ramanujan's genius and trying to help him project himself better to be accepted by the academic world forms the crux of the story.
The movie is an adaptation of a 1991 book of the same name and serves less as a biopic on Ramanujan, rather focusing on Hardy's tryst with the genius. The movie beautifully develops the character of Hardy as a reserved man with very few friends and no family, with mathematics as the only driving factor in his life. Hardy's care and concern for Ramanujan, makes him experience the human side within himself where many a times he is at a loss of words or gestures to convey his emotions, but is understood and appreciated by Ramanujan none the less. It is the story of his tryst with a genius that made him experience life from a different perspective."
" Very emotional movie
",2017-11-03 00:00:00,9,"Movie is Very heart touching. I cried a lot especially at last part. Worth watching. Very glad to know a less known man but a great human being as well as a great mathematician. Salute to a Brilliant mathematician who couldn't get recognition of world at large but in field of mathematics, his contribution is duly recognized today."
" living on inspiration
",2017-09-03 00:00:00,6,"It's the early 20th century. Srinivasa Ramanujan (Dev Patel) is an Indian with no higher learning degrees. He struggles to get his math papers published. He leaves behind his disbelieving mother and loving wife for Cambridge. British mathematics professor G.H. Hardy (Jeremy Irons) mentors him but often dismisses his intuitive leaps for more rigorous proofs. Being homesick and suffering actual sickness, he struggles against the entrenched establishment and outright prejudice as WWI engulfs the world.It's a tale of inspiration but there isn't much drama in its telling. It is utterly conventional without tension. Patel and Irons do yeoman's work bringing life to these real people. There is simply no whiz bang flash to liven up the story. There is no end goal. Almost everything is done with unyielding conventionality. A little flash from Ramanujan is the biggest emotional lift. Otherwise, it remains mostly flat and predictable."
" A great film about Ramanujan, but more than just math
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,8,"A moving account of Srinivasa Ramanujan, the genius mathematician who rose out of poverty in India to solve problems believed to be unsolvable, and whose profound insights have altered math all the way up to the present day. The cast is very strong, led by Dev Patel in the role of Ramanujan, and including Jeremy Irons as his mentor G. H. Hardy and Devika Bhise as the wife he leaves behind in India to study at Trinity College in Cambridge. Director Matt Brown captures some great shots in both Madras and Cambridge, and effectively transformed the biography of Ramanujan into a screenplay which is nuanced and much more than math.It is fascinating to see the mentor obviously surpassed by the student (and knowing it), but trying to temper creative genius with the need to grind out proofs, but the movie also includes the dynamics of conservative and liberal politics at the time leading up to WWI, love and sacrifice, and atheism and faith. It also has the ugly racism Ramanujan encountered, as well as shows how hard it was for him to adapt to being in England. There is a human element here, as well as a spiritual element. ""There are patterns in everything. The color in light, the reflections in water... in math, these patterns reveal themselves in the most incredible form. It's quite beautiful,"" he says. Another time, after Hardy has taken a taxi with the number 1729 on it and mentioned that the number is rather dull, Ramanujan comments ""No, it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways"", which is a true anecdote.It's hard to fathom those singular few, who out of billions of people who have been born have such extraordinary gifts. It's not hyperbole to put Ramanujan in the same class as Mozart and Newton, and it's heartbreaking that he died at the age 32. How fantastic is it that this movie honors him, and is so well made. Don't believe the negative reactions (""boring"", ""slow"", ""routine"", etc), but the film is quiet and intelligent ‚Äì which I found not only understandable but appropriate given the subject matter (hey it's not Iron Man folks). If that's not your thing, though, you should probably look elsewhere."
" Thank you Hollywood for telling this story,his greatness would have been lost after our family

" Two Prime Numbers.
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,6,"Dev Patel is Srinivasa Ramanujan, the young man who is a mathematical genius and works his way up from one of the more culturally devalued areas of India, Madras, to a royal fellowship at Cambridge, under the tutelage of G. H. Hardy, and suffers an early death from tuberculosis.Early scenes shot in India establish his background -- poverty, a loving and beautiful wife, and a demanding and domineering mother. Patel can't keep his nose out of books. The solutions to complicated problems in math come to him unbidden, intuitively. As he later declares, they are put there by God. His entreaties to the august G. H. Hardy, Jeremy Irons, come as a surprise in the post. Patel's solutions are so good that Irons thinks some friend at Trinity College is playing a joke on him. But the letters are real enough, and Irons arranges for Patel's transport to Cambridge in the years before World War I, his future so bright that he has to wear shades. There, Patel is put up in a comfortable room but finds that he's served meat in the mess hall and he's a vegetarian. The necessary shoes are also a nuisance to feet that have never met a shoe. There is prejudice against the Wog. There is his family back in Madras where Ama, who never approved of the marriage, hides her son's letters to his wife and only pretends to mail hers to him. This may strike us as pretty nasty but mainly because we don't have the strong extended families that India had in 1913. Marriages were still arranged by families and wives knew their place in the household. Their job was to sit and fan the flies away while the husband ate, and then the wives got the leftovers. The tradition was called varna, with a retroflex ""r"". I mention all this only to suggest that the wife was not as powerful a figure as the mother.And now, if someone will just help me down from behind this lectern -- Thank you. See, the problem is that Patel's solutions come to him from God and Irons, his sponsor and mentor, is an atheist who doesn't believe in OUR god let alone a multitude of many-armed dancing figurines and reincarnation. (""Maybe you'll come back as a pigeon turd."") Irons won't be satisfied in Patel's solutions unless Patel can come up with proofs instead of epiphanies.""Proof"" in math, as I recall from high school geometry, goes a little like this. Somebody presents an argument that, let's say, at the very bottom of the ocean there are strong creatures adapted to the monumental pressure and the freezing temperatures and utter darkness. It's an elegant argument, showing how physiology can keep fish blood from freezing, how an organism may evolve to resist the pressure, and so forth. It makes sense. But the proof of the argument lies in catching one of those organisms.Patel's solutions are ""jumpy and very wild,"" as a prof once described my theorizing in a sociology class. Irons demands the proofs. He has to, if they intend the work to be published without being ridiculed. It's a source of continuing conflict between them -- Patel and his god, and Irons and his proof. As you can see, the difficulty takes us beyond combinations and permutations into the realm of the unknowable. Of course, the two of them face a superordinate enemy. Except for a couple of fellow at Trinity, like Littlewood and Bertrand Russell, they are both bludgeoned by the staff. Irons has introduced Baboo here, and Patel himself is swarthy and uppity. In the end, the two have become close friends, although, in the usual manner of U-C Brits, Irons is unable to be very expressive about it.The performances are all pretty good. I'm happy that Patel was cast as Srinivasa Ramanujan because he's so unprepossessing, not particularly handsome and sporting a pair of big ears. At that, he's more presentable than the real Ramanujan. Irons is always a pleasure to watch, except maybe for that Die Hard feature in which he was forced to play a villain with a German accent.The narrative can't avoid some of the usual elements of the biographical movie. Every protagonist implies its antagonist. There must be demons to overcome otherwise what the hell kind of a movie are we talking about? The heroic figure -- math genius, athlete, politician, singer, dancer, or pop icon -- travels along a monotonic path to the top of the heap, gets there, and then STAYS there? So Ramanujan and Hardy must have their Fellows at Cambridge and one has in addition family troubles and tuberculosis. So the unavoidable elements are there, yes, but rather nicely handled. Nobody's head is wrenched off. I enjoyed it."
" We may not all know much about maths. We all know something about life.
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,8,"Pure mathematics might seem too abstract a subject to translate easily to the cinema screen, but recent years have seen three major Hollywood films about mathematicians, ""Good Will Hunting"", ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Proof"". ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"" is a British film on a similar subject. Like ""A Beautiful Mind"" it is a filmed biography of a real-life mathematician, in this case the Indian Srinivasa Ramanujan.The action takes place in the early twentieth century. Ramanujan, originally from a humble background, is able to obtain a job as an accountant in the city of Madras because of his mathematical skills. It soon becomes apparent, however, that his skills are of a far higher order than those normally required for accountancy and that he is capable of understanding complex mathematical problems. Ramanujan writes to Harold Hardy, a mathematics don at Trinity College Cambridge, who realises that the young man is something exceptional and who invites him to study at Cambridge.Ramanujan takes up that invitation, but he does not find life in Cambridge easy. He is forced to leave his young wife Janaki in Madras, and the prospect of her joining him becomes even more remote when World War breaks out shortly after his arrival in England. He is the subject of racial bigotry, not only from local people- he is beaten up by a group of soldiers- but even from within the academic community. One mathematics don verbally abuses him, calling him a ""wog"" to his face, and although the other members of the faculty are more careful not to give vent to their prejudices so openly, it is clear that race is the main reason which prevents Ramanujan from being elected a Fellow of the College. He also suffers from health problems brought on by the cold climate. (Cambridge can be notoriously cold in winter; the flat East Anglian landscape means that it is exposed to every icy wind coming off the North Sea).Although Ramanujan and Hardy become friends, their relationship is not always an easy one, largely because their attitudes to mathematics are very different. Ramanujan is able to develop brilliant mathematical theories by intuition, but struggles with developing the rigorous proofs which are needed to test those theories and which Hardy insists upon. Their differing attitudes to mathematics are grounded in very different attitudes to life. Hardy is an atheist who will not accept the truth of any proposition, whether it relates to mathematics or anything else, which cannot be proved by logic or experiment. Ramanujan is a devout Hindu who believes that his mathematical insights come to him via divine inspiration and that any equation is meaningless unless it expresses a thought in the mind of God.Period dramas are ten-a-penny in the modern British cinema, but this is a good one. The London Mathematical Society said that it outshines ""Good Will Hunting"" in almost every way. Actually, that is probably not difficult, as I found ""Good Will Hunting"" a horribly overrated film, deeply disappointing in almost every way except for a fine performance from the late Robin Williams. I would also, however, rate ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"" higher than either ""A Beautiful Mind"" or ""Proof"", largely because of two excellent performances in the leading roles, from Dev Patel as Ramanujan and Jeremy Irons as Hardy. In reality Hardy was only ten years older than Ramanujan, but here the age difference is much greater, and at times their relationship is almost that of father and son rather than teacher and pupil. Or perhaps one could say that their relationship is not only that of teacher and pupil but also that of pupil and teacher, because Hardy comes to realise that he has as much to learn from the younger man- about life as well as about mathematics- as vice versa.I said at the beginning of this review that pure mathematics is an abstract subject, but you don't need to be a mathematical expert- and I am far from being one- to appreciate this film. The reason is that here it is not an abstract subject at all. It becomes a metaphor for life. We may not all know much about maths. We all know something about life. 8/10"
" Absolutely brilliant movie, math is the side dish
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,9,"I found this movie by accident at my local library and cannot believe the good fortune to have been introduced to such an outstanding role model for humanity. As a fan of Dev Patel from Slumdog and other works, this role was every bit as good, and Jeremy Irons played the role of Hardy to perfection; he even looks a good bit like the real professor back then. The courage of a young man to travel to a distant land because of his belief in the equations and formulas that just appeared in his head, the relationships between he and the professor, the portrayal of the typical discrimination of outsiders and Indians from Britain, and the beauty of the Trinity campus as well as the love between a man and wife who shared little time together, everyone will enjoy this movie if they just see it through, as Ramanujen did."
" Nice Movie

Overall the acting was also natural. I watched it twice which is rare in my case.I recommend this for those who want to achieve something but feel their luck do not support and those who feel they do not have resources."
" Fascinating Bio Pic
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,8,"This very good looking & interesting movie has the feel of a film made by someone who has not made a movie before, in fact, 'Infinity' represents director Mathew Brown's second feature. Brown works hard as both screenplay writer and producer and obviously means well but, to the trained eye something seems lacking. Fortunately, the choice of Londoner Larry Smith as director of photography is superb. Smith gives the film a lush visual treatment, either under direction from Brown or guided by his own professionalism. With a lesser cinematographer much more would have been lost. It could be said this is essentially a mathematicians' or historian's film but, as a biopic on the life of Tamil Indian Spinivasa Ramanujan, an ill-educated brilliant mind, it is insightful & compelling. Brown's screenplay is based on Award-winning American writer Robert Kanigel's biography of the same name ‚Äì with Kanigel also co-producing the movie. Ramanujan's life was spent in poverty, his consuming passion and expertise were mathematics and one of his Indian employers, recognizing this, encouraged him to write to Cambridge Professor G.H.Hardy (Irons). This led to an invitation to study and contribute to Hardy's theories at Cambridge. Srinivasa (well played by Dev Patel) experienced the stifling (and cruel) class consciousness of the snobbish, British academic set - only holding his own through sheer tenacity & his superior numerical intellect. If looking for some based-on-fact inspiration this stylish (if not exciting) work should prove informative. The Music score also offers impressive atmospherics by skilfully blending western and eastern styles. As intelligent viewing, it comes recommended."
" For the serous movie-goer...even if you don't ""get"" mathematics
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,7,"I've enjoyed Dev Patel in a number of films (especially ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"") and in cable's ""The Newsroom"". I thought he had potential. But with this film -- which is about a topic I hate -- mathematics -- I thought the old saying (slightly paraphrased) was appropriate: Instead of ""Today you are a man"", ""Today you are an actor."" To me, there is one problem with this film. It's difficult to relate to the story since the average film-goer doesn't have the slightest idea what these mathematicians are doing. I'm quite well educated...but what they're going means nothing to me.And so, most of us can only relate to half the film -- the human story. And that is something that most of us can relate to. Prejudice. Family intrigue. How to accept another human being. Giftedness. And other human themes. And it is here that both Dev Patel and Jeremy Irons shine. And, I also have to give a nod to a British actor that I usually care for (perhaps because of the parts I've seen him in) -- Toby Jones -- whom I found quite endearing here. Devika Bhise, as Patel's wife, is also very good. The other actors...mostly British...do their jobs well, but don't really stand out.But while I consider this a sort of break-out movie for Dev Patel, I want to focus for a moment on Jeremy Irons. I look at ""actors"" like (well, I'll pick on Tom Cruise here as one example) Tom Cruise, and I know that when it comes to the craft of acting, they can't hold a candle to someone like Jeremy Irons. He was never a matin√©e ""star"" in the normal sense of the word, but throughout his career he has demonstrated an understanding of the real craft of acting...and he does it again here.If you are a serious movie-goer, even if (like me) you're not into mathematics, I recommend this film."

" I'm sure the real Srinivasa Ramanujan deserved a much better film adaptation of their story!
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,6,"'THE MAN WHO KNEW INFINITY': Three Stars (Out of Five)A British biopic about a brilliant mathematician from India, named Srinivasa Ramanujan, who made history in mathematical theories, during World War I. The film stars Dev Patel, Jeremy Irons, Devika Bhise and Toby Jones. It was directed and written by Matthew Brown, and it's based on the book, of the same name, by Robert Kanigel. The movie performed decently in indie theaters, at the Box Office, and it's received mixed reviews from critics. I thought it was OK. The story begins at the turn of the twentieth century, when Srinivasa Ramanujan (Patel) was extremely poor, and still living in Madras, India. His exceptional mathematical skills became very useful to his employers there, who began using him for multiple accounting jobs. They later encouraged him to go to college. A well known mathematician, at Cambridge University, named G.H. Hardy (Patel), then heard about Srinivasa (and he became very impressed by what he heard), so he invited him to come study under him. Srinivasa took him up on the offer, while he also married his girlfriend (Bhise), and he later became a renowned expert in mathematical theories, thanks to Hardy's guidance. The movie is, how can I say this nicely, boring. I'm sure there's a very inspiring, and quite interesting, story that could have been told, but the filmmakers failed to do so. It's a shame too, because Patel and Irons are both really good actors. I'm sure they were both hoping they were working with a much better director, and screenwriter. I'm also sure the real Srinivasa Ramanujan, and G.H. Hardy, deserved a much better film adaptation of their story!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M9osPwjfbM"
" Compelling and heartbreaking film
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,10,The true story of an Indian maths genius who gets to Cambridge University just prior to WW1. On the face of it a film about a mathematician seems a dull subject for a film and to many it probably is. However this film is so well done it doesn't really matter what the subject is about. Rarely does an actor come across as likable as Dev Patel and his role in this elevates it a notch higher than maybe it should. He plays Srinivasa Ramanujan who stuns Cambridge by solving a mathematics puzzle that was thought to be unsolvable. Patel lights up every scene he is in and receives great support from the ever dependable Jeremy Irons. It may be slow in places as it charts Ramanujans struggles but the film slowly sucks you in before unleashing a body blow right at the end of the film. This is a superb and heartbreaking drama that is much more enjoyable than you think it will be. Highly recommended.
" A Movie Worth Watching
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,10,"At last, a mentally stimulating movie in the intellectual desert of today's world of entertainment. Although it deals with the achievements of a genius along with a glimpse of his personal life, it highlights the extraordinariness of the mind behind them with simple examples without going too much into the intricacies of higher mathematics which makes it particularly enjoyable to mathematically-minded lay persons.Some perceptive reviewer has mentioned Galois in this context which was highly interesting. Galois was a young prodigy who had the habit of writing the answers next to mathematical problems without showing the intermediate steps. Unfortunately it also resulted in his being twice denied admission to Ecole Polytechnique, the prestigious French university. Although his answers to the questions in the admission test were all correct, he was baffled when the examiners insisted that he show the steps because to him the answer itself was the next step.In the words of Ovid - In this place I am a barbarian, because men do not understand me.However, the main difference between Galois and Ramanujan seems to have been that while Galois would work out the answers to problems in his head at lightning speed, Ramanujan would come up with formulas to solve problems entirely in his head without showing their step-by-step derivation and, if the movie is correct, when he was challenged by the Cambridge faculty to show their derivations in a systematic manner, he retorted why he would have to do that because he could ""see"" them.Cambridge even appointed a professor named Hardy to ""teach"" Ramanujan the ""proper"" way to derive the formulas although according to Hardy's own admission, those sessions always left him wondering who learned more from whom.And that was the crux of the matter. An analogy could be the difference between a blind and a sighted man of comparable intelligence. While the blind man could detect the presence of a wall only by walking up to it until he actually touched it, the sighted man could tell its presence from a distance because he could see it. In fact, he could also see other things like the clouds, the sky, the sun , the moon, the planets, the stars and the galaxies which the blind man would have no idea about.Which also makes one wonder whether such gifted people have higher levels of perception that enable them to ""see"" things that the rest of us can only find after painstaking effort or perhaps not at all and when we are unable to understand their special power, we label it as ""intuition"".Incidentally Galois too, like Ramanujan, had suffered an untimely death."
" Touching and Gentile
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"This is the story of the journey of a groundbreaking Indian mathematician who finds himself in England at Trinity College. He meets a professor played by Jeremy Irons, who works to get him to extend his genius, to provide proofs for incredible insights. He is required to take coursework, but his professors resent his genius. Other students hate him as well. Before he went to England, he was a peasant boy in Madras. Once he had work, he was able to marry, but he had to leave his family, and, in particular, his wife. Unfortunately, his mother became jealous and intercepted the correspondence between them (his wife could not read or write so dictated them), hoping he would someday return. The story is formulaic in that where genius is concerned the work becomes the center of things. Still, it is quite a beautiful portrayal of a fascinating man and his world."
" A movie about the Great man and a mathematician
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,10,"Great movie .. full packed emotional drama .. Ramanujan death in his young age is one of the biggest loss to the mathematical world ... If he had been respected and taken care properly(needs like healthy vegetarian food, enough money, proper vacation back to his home town ) by the university in London , he would have lived longer. I got tears towards the end. Must watch movie and worth watching especially if you are a research student. Ego ,jealous and possessiveness were all joined hands and took him away from us in his early age. He had developed extraordinary focus which was the gift for his undisturbed highly mediated prayers during his childhood. It was not just en entertainment movie but I came to know about a legend and his summary of life. There are lot of such talents getting wasted because of insufficient exposure and care."
