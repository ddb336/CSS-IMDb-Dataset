" Most Underrated movie of all time
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,10,This movie is seriously one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time period. For a 1st time viewing the movie is suspenseful as heck and I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through. The acting is incredible for the 3 main leads. The story is super unique about how the past can come back to haunt you as well. I was not expecting the twist at the end at all and the movie does a complete 180 from the beginning to the end. I give major props to Joel Edgerton for creating a movie that is super slept on that everyone should watch for an unbelievable experience.
" Surprisingly very good
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,7,"A really good movie that captivated me with its twist and turns. A movie about life, revenge and what it means to be a good person - particularly in Western society. A grossly underrated film."
" Monkey business
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,6,"Badged as a thriller, this is more of a study of bullying and its consequences.It only belatedly resorts to shock tactics and big melodramatic flourishes. It is a slow-burning, nuanced affair in which your perspective on the protagonists gradually shifts. Their attitude toward one another also shifts, as people discover how little they really know about each other."
" It Was Ok
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,5,"Not a bad flick. Good acting, interesting plot at first. Some twists and turns that were unexpected. The last 1/4 of the movie kinda fell flat for me, and felt like they were just rushing to a conclusion. Ending was just kinda meh."
" Spectacular revenge on a bully.
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,10,"This is a good film about the long term effects of bullying on a victim who could not cope with it. The film gives subtle and not so subtle glimpses in the nasty personality of Simon in several scenes before his vicious final acts on his old victim and a new one. Gordo, the fragile and seriously damaged victim of Simon's high school bullying gets his devious revenge 25 years later in a most clever way without any physical violence (maybe or maybe not). Worth the time to watch. The only likeable character is Robyn who remains innocent to the crimes of both men but served as a pawn in their schemes. Very well done thriller. Good plot twists!"
" Surprisingly good
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,7,"A fun and tense drama/thriller. Though a little predicatable at times, the acting and writing were great; and I really enjoyed the third act. A good feature length debut from a decorated actor.(Also loved the little shining reference in the hospital)"
" Not what I was expecting in the best possible way
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,9,I honestly do not understand the negative reviews here. It's a perfect thriller that goes places you'd never expect it to go. Almost completely unpredictable with great performances.
" more of a moralistic drama than a jump-scare chiller
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,7,"Australian actor Joel Edgerton wrote, produced and directed this drama with thriller elements,. Rebecca Hall and Jason Bateman star as a married couple newly moved to Los Angeles. They run into a old high school classmate of Bateman's (Edgerton) who seems desperate to restart a friendship that Bateman can't remember them having. Hall begins to suspect that something isn't right with Edgerton and that her husband isn't telling the whole truth about their past.This has all of the trappings of one of those late-80's ""yuppie nightmare"" thrillers that glutted the market for about eight years, with the upscale settings and work environments of the characters getting upset by a malignant outside force, a situation that draws the worst out of the victims. Bateman is clever casting, as he's one of the best actors in his age range at portraying borderline nice-at-heart-or-really-a-jerk characters, which here keeps the audience guessing. Edgerton is normally a very physical actor, but here he's reserved and quiet. Hall is very good as the woman at the center of this odd dynamic, and she has her own past issues to deal with. I think audiences going into this expecting a rollercoaster-ride thriller will be disappointed, and while I don't want to spoil where things go, I think it's advisable to let viewers know that this is more of a moralistic drama than a jump-scare chiller."
" I think this movie is good.
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,8,"I thought it was good. I was pleasantly surprised to NOT see Jason Bateman in his usual role of ""the emasculated male"". I thought the acting was great.Yes, at first, I probably had the same reaction many viewers had - ""new couple moves into a new house, meets a weird stranger, he comes around too often, strange things start to happen."" We've all seen this before. But then it took interesting turns I found intriguing.Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall and Joel Edgerton are terrific. I rolled my eyes a little in the beginning. But then I was entertained all the way through to the end.SPOILERS;I don't agree with the negative reviews. They mostly say if you've ever seen a show like 48 Hours, Dateline, 20/20, or CSI --- the ending doesn't work. I disagree. I watch those shows and it does work.Gordo tells Simon in the end, ""I never touched her. But we'll never know."" What about a DNA test? A DNA test only tells who the father is. Not if Gordo raped Robyn. Matter of fact, it works better if it is Simon's kid. He has a son he'll never raise.""What about the key, audio disc and video disc?"" That doesn't prove anything other than Gordo is a stalker. Doesn't prove he ever entered the house uninvited. Doesn't prove he drugged and raped Robyn. Doesn't even prove he took their dog.Being guilty of stalking is a small price to pay for ruining a man's life. He essentially destroyed Simon's career and marriage.Last but not least, people ask, ""What was the point of the movie?"" I think it's pretty obvious, ""Don't be a bully. What goes around, comes around.""I thought it was good."
" Didn't expect to like this based on recent reviews but...
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,7,"I thought it was a solid watch. If you like mysteries, then you'll enjoy this movie. I must admit, it is a slow burn, so i wrote it off in the beginning. But I started paying attention around 30 mins lol. But by the end, I had to go back and rewatch the first 30 I had written off. And I was wrong. Trust me. Just follow the story. It's a ride that's taking you somewhere that you will find interesting."
" Slow, uninspiring, garbage
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,3,"Utter rubbish, same old plot . Nothing happens for 1hr and its at the point where you can't switch off as you need to know what happens, even though you have spent an hour hoping for something to happen ......... hoping for something different, but unfortunately after 90 mins it has been another 90 mins of your life you will never get back."
" Intense
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,9,"It doesn't have ups and downs so much as mellows and thrills. You know that it keeps building to something big in what I would describe as a ""gripping"" fashion, and it's worth it. The movie is good. Pacing is executed perfectly. A couple scares and two pairs of pants later I got to the end which was done brilliantly. I'm gonna remember this one. Great to watch by yourself, not really a party movie, safe to watch with parents. Would recommend everyone watch this once."
" What's in the box!!!???
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,8,"This movie was a genuine thriller the name though had me very confused and I was torn with the Thorton movie ideology. Otherwise this film will keep you speculating the truth and then it flips it on you. Bateman plays the straight man well almost sociopathic acting at parts sways towards the end but good performance. Hall with her short hair I dont care for reminded me a bit of Theron in devil's advocate plays a bit of the role of the audience and non the wiser.
What works amazingly well is the indie style filming of obscure close ups and aguemented cut a ways. The tension builds through out the film more and more which is why thrillers are my favorite genre and this is a good one! Of course the downfall is that it is a one perhaps two shot kill I cant see watching it again and again since knowing the end makes you feel dirty needing a bath.
Lies and truths this movie has a plenty, otherwise the last 10 mins or so seem horror movie like a bit over done climatic but it wraps the gift up very intrinsically and you have the aha moment. Disturbing but somewhat far fetched premise but otherwise an better than good thriller mystery worth the time, watch with friends or your significant other."
" Waste of time
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,2,"The movie was fine if you enjoy ""my wife is crazy, I am a mean, wealthy husband"" sort of thing. Horrible, unnecessary ending. Not in a good-horrible, amazingly disturbing, genius kind of way... just in a ""let's make this woman a victim for no reason. NOW DO YOU FEEL BAD, HUSBAND??"" kind of way. The wife's friend is the best. Extra stars for Lucy."
" Ok
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,5,"Just alright, had high expectations after reading the reviews but it was mediocre."
" Why all the positive reviews?
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,3,"Therw is so much wrong with this film i dont know where to start. And Trust me there's a lot which mind boggles me even more why this is a 7.1/10 currently..The wife is horrible and the acting is mediocre. The introduction along with the dialog is plain. ""Gordo's"" acting was great as well as ""Simon's"" as always. The suspense and soundtrack is really good and thats about all the good. Now with the bad. The viewer is made to believe gordo is bad then as the film goes on you feel bad for him and Simon is made to be bad and then the director flips the viewer off and make both Gordy and simon bad with a hilariously bad ending.. I mean this has got to be one of the poorest, horribly unintelligent endings I've ever seen. Without spoiling anything Gordy would easily be convicted because of dna and video proof and the only good/innocent character in this is the one that has had panic attacks and is possibly raped? Totally messed up and a waste of a possibly good film idea.I wouldn't reccomend this as a watch as its too poorly executed, plot holes everywhere and builds up to let you down. 3/10."
" I can't decide
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,5,"This film to me is neither good nor bad. It's was hyped up to me as a great thriller. And to that I say, somewhat. The plot was original, I haven't seen anything like it. The acting by Jason Bateman is something I haven't seen him do before. So it's was refreshing, and I admire the producers for putting him in that role. I someone thought about it after, wondered about the twist ending. I liked the pacing I felt it went at a good pace. But I wouldn't put it as one of my favourite films, but if you're looking for a toned down psychological thriller to just watch. Then this is it."
" The Gift
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,7,"The Gift was a good job for Edgerton while he was making it cause for a debut he did a very good job and created a good suspensful film that has some creepy characters and some great use of said atmosfere.It is really hard when you ar directing,writing and staring in your own film but Joel did a hell of a job in all segments and he showed that he needs to make more projects.Also how surprised me was Jason Bateman who showed that he can be a good dramatic actor which is common thing along side other comedians in industry.The Gift was a good suspensul film with good chills and thrills"
" Good script, Mr. Edgerton. Bravo!
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,7,"""Oh joy, another privacy-invasion thriller"". That was my first spontaneous thought when ""The Gift"" aired on television. I don't necessarily dislike the family-stalker concept, and it always remains somewhat unsettling and identifiable (because we all know someone we don't like but who doesn't get the subtle hints), but I've seen too many of these already and they are all quite predictable.And that's exactly how ""The Gift"" starts out, too. Clichéd and derivative with sequences you have seen plenty of times before. You basically just keep watching for the performances. I've liked Jason Bateman since the very first minute of ""Arrested Development"", and he's probably the most suitable actor in contemporary Hollywood to depict a regular guy. Rebecca Hall's role, as the docile wife Robyn, is rather bland, but she's a good actress and makes the most of it. Writer/director Joel Edgerton also cast himself as the obtrusive and self-declared ""friend of the family"" who comes with undesired gifts and unwanted household help. Edgerton, as well, hits the exact right tone, since he's uncanny but not exaggeratedly psychotic.But then something highly unusual and rarely before seen happens. The tables turn entirely. I'm not just talking about an unexpected plot twist, but a complete and fundamental change of how the viewer perceives the two lead characters. And, moreover, Edgerton's script gets away with it! Obviously, I can't (and do not want to) reveal too much about the plot's complete U-turn, but I personally found it dared, realistic, progressive and - oh yes - even a bit confronting. It's brutally honest, and it makes the film result in a sort of anti-climax, but nevertheless a very strong and thought-provoking one. The moral of the film? I guess it can most effectively be summarized with the great lyrics of the almighty Billy Joel's song ""Honesty"".Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you"
" Great movie
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,This was a great stalker film starring Jason Bateman. If you like stalker type thrillers this is a good movie to watch I highly recommend this one.
" Yuck. Just yuck..
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,1,The first half hour was just completely boring filler with really cringey awkward lines and over acting to perfectly normal conversations and situations. She clearly doesn't want the guy around yet keeps inviting him in and they keep accepting his gifts and go to his place XD Oooh okkk that makes sense...Not to mention the part that's like:omg you don't have kids? Wow your life must be empty and worthless...Jesus Christ. 37% of my generation doesn't want or have kids and this bs stereotypical crap needs to stop. How many times do i need to see them brush their teeth? Gross. Ohhh if someone doesn't like you and they think you are crazy that means you can't be well off. Ya cuz crazy people are only poor. Shut it off after 32 mins. Wasn't worth watching.
" Superior Psychodrama/Slow Burn Thriller
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,8,Really well done by Edgerton.Bateman is always solid and perfectly cast as the lead.
" It doesn't end when the credits roll ...
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,9,"... because the characters will live on in your mind as you imagine the consequences of that ending.
It's a great, dark, psychological thriller. Well written and well acted.
It builds tension very slowly but steadily as it knocks down your theories as to just what is going on.
I gave it an extra star for it's lack of plot-holes."
" Decent Film, well worth the watch
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,7,"I had looked to watch this film for some time, due to the trailer setting up what i believed to be an interesting plot line.It turned ourt to meet my expectations, making me feel for the main characters, as i felt myslef when someone is just encroaching in my life too much and making me feel a bit uncomfortable, as an inevitable confrontation is coming or i bury my head in the sand and hope it passes.To others, give this a watch, it will not blow you away, but will keep you focused and as i said empathetic to the characters."
" Jason
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,8,It's good to see Jason Bateman not be the perfect gentleman in a film for once
" - why would he do that? - because he could
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,8,"I love the casual flow of the movie having again a casual suspense coupled with the right soundtrack.
A young couple moves to Los Angeles as a result of husband's (Simon) job change.
Wife(Robyn) does not work, but used to work in the past.
She wants to have a baby but somehow it just did not happen.
But also it looks like that she is not sure if she is happy with Simon, she feels something is odd with her relation.
In LA, Simon comes across a high school friend, Gordo, and they start socializing.
Old friend sounds like bit odd, scripted, psychopath.Movie is about the old wound Gordo suffered in high school because of Simon.
This incident caused miserable consequences in Gordo's life.
Now, it is time for Gordo's vengeance.Simon does not tell Robyn reason behind the strange behaviors of Gordo.
Robyn got suspicious about Simon's relation with Gordo, and start investigating.
While talking to another alumni from the same class, she has following dialogue.She asks to him
why would he(Simon) do that?answer
because he could.I love this dialogue.
In my view, entire narrative of the movie is based on this. It reminds me Nietzsche's ""You are not responsible for your actions""In the mean time Robyn got pregnant,
Simon got promoted to a new position at his job by eliminating the other candidate by smear.
While celebrating his promotion at home with colleagues, his victim stones home, breaks window.
All got out and Simon got him. Victim accuses Simon for his smear on him for the promotion.
Simon's manager. and others hear all this.Robyn was right about gut feeling on her husband.
He was a bully at high school, and can have a smear on others.
Ans he is still like that.She gave a birth.
On the day of having baby, Simon comes across three disasters
1- His company fires him after discovering his smear on other candidate
2- Gordo leaves him some evidences that baby might be from him OR not.
3- Robyn is not returning to Simon after hospitalyes.
Fakeness could haunt you, and eventually destroy you at your most happy moment.
One's fakeness could also result in others becoming psychopaths.
Because although Gordo was a victim, eventually he became a fake one, psychopath also.
And Robyn was right about her odd gut feelings about Simon.
This movie displays all of it perfectly."

" Great film killer plot
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,10,"Loved this film. Unfolded so well. Kept you at the edge of your seat through out, full of intrigue and mystery. Had a moral to its story and a really powerful ending. Acting was superb and characters really made you feel for them."
" Terrible film
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,2,Yes terrible. It was a waste of my tome and the ending was predictable and completely rubbish. Wouldnt bother.
" Great Thriller
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,9,"Loved this film. Was hooked from the beginning
Jason Bateman was incredible."
" A familiar theme but with a twist
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,8,"I really liked Jason Bateman in Ozark so I thought I'd give this a try despite the familiar sounding theme.
However I'd underestimated it. The basic story is the same; a happy young married couple's lives are thrown up in the air when an intrusive stranger enters their lives. Except he isn't and the way the story plays out is not what you'd expect. Well worth a watch."
" Excellent and surprising
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,8,"What an excellent and surprising film. It's not possible to say what it's about, without that becoming a spoiler, but it is a very thoughtful examination of those things, and of their consequences. It builds the tension expertly, and it's very entertaining. But it also manages to maintain a high level of authenticity and credibility, which significantly adds to the drama. Really, very good, and well worth watching."
" A Surprising moral Thriller with a cerebral twist. No murder like illuminati movies. Very smart movie.
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,10,"A married middle class couple, Simon Cullum (Jason Bateman) and Robyn Cullem (Rebecca Hall) from Chicago move back to Los Angeles due to Simon's new job in a Sales company as Robyn continues with the successful business in interior design. During shopping for home accessories in the high street, they meet with Gordon ""Gordo"" Mosley (Joel Edgerton) who knew Simon back in high school. So they invited him over to the house. Shortly after, Simon displays odd condescending attitude and epithets towards Gordon and wrapped up gifts show up one at a time at the modern achitectural Cullem home as Gordon visits Robyn. Secrets start to unravel. Including the truth.This is Joel Edgerton's debut in acting, directing, producing, and writing this movie. For a novice he pulled this movie off as a seasoned movie maker and his acting and visage reminds me of Elias Koteas. The photography of the movie is well shot, the dialogue is believable, and the direction along with the pacing is perfect. I was not bored one bit during the movie, I was intrigued to know what happened next.
I don't believe Gordo is harmful as most audience think, he never harmed a dog who went missing which I cared about and finally came back unscathed. Robyn had a past we get to understand, and I cared for both her and Gordo. The only one I despised was Jason Bateman's Simon, was he made to be hateful? Very much so, he reminded me of the bully from Octavia Spencer's Ma, so not the type of guy you want to award a gold medal for being sociopath of the decade. I heard he was a comedian and this was his first serious role, if that is the case then Joel knows talent when he sees it.
Look out for David Denman ( from Brightburn) who did a short but sweet performance as a Doctor helping out Robyn.
There is only a few jump scares which I know people hate but it's only a few so it doesn't not bother me because this movie relies on suspense and to me that is effective.
The movie had a Shakespearian story plot, because it is cerebral and no murder at last. How many illuminati movies had murder in a revenge movie? This is a decent movie to show pure Greek tragedy without the blood bath because it reflects not all good people want to harm anyone but just target those who deserve to pay for their evil actions. The movie got me thinking so much that I told my Twin Flame, and his family, my mother and my friends like wow! You got to see this film. Love it, deserved more recognition and I hope Joel Edgerton comes up with more movies because he is very promising for Hollywood."
" the bully revenge
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,8,"The plot and storyline is amazing it keeps you wonder what's next.
good thriller and nice cast that can reflect the ethical dilemma of being bullied.
the message of the movie is loud and clear focusing on being good or bad are you a bully, a lair how will do anything achieve what he wants while hurting others in process.All in all, it's a nice movie to watch."
" Serves you right
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,8,Poor Gordo. You really feel for him and what he did was a bit much. But it's actually a good little revenge film.
" One little lie can result in huge consequences
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,9,"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. This is movie made me feel different emotions. It made me feel uncomfortable, awkward and surprised at some time.
The acting was also really good from the 3 main actors/actresses.
I would say that you should definitely check this movie out!"
" Joel Edgertons gift to us all
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,7,"Really enjoyed this film, kept asking questions during the film trying to work out what happens next or what did Simon do to Gordo for him to resent him so much! I would have loved at the end the child to be infact Gordon's but I think we all know that is not the guy he is, or portrayed out to be, he is just a troubled man who was bullied as a kid, he is not an evil person. Although I do like how for the rest of his life Simon may be questioning if the kid is his or not and that Gordo will now be an unpleasant memory he won't be able to rid. Would recommend this film, another Jason Bateman film that does not disappoint."
" It was so great and unexpected.
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,9,"From the start to the finish, everything was kind of unpredictable. The pace and sound was perfect as it made us feel the tense air in the manner that we kept on guessing a bit the plot and it turned a bit around and around.
I mention ""one word"" that the movie is all about and it gets sppoiled but you have to go finish half of it to get the hint of that. The thing it so depicts well is not everything is as clear as it seems and not everyone is....you get the gist of it."
" Engaging and smartly written.
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,8,"A highly enjoyable and creepy thriller. Certainly makes you question as to who is the real villain here! A uniquely and we'll executed plot.
The movie respects the audience's intelligence and the characters do not act overly stupid. All the characters' motivations and behaviours are believable. Best of all, the movie is genuinely thought-provoking and the ending will linger with you as you debate the meaning with your friends. If you like this genre of movies, I highly recommend this film."
" Very weak film
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,3,"I'm baffled by all these positive reviews. I watched this based on the good rating here and I regret it. I don't mind slow paced movies if they are artistic or subtly intriguing but for a movie so often described as a ""thriller"" I wanted a little more meat. I feel I wasted my evening.
The characters behaved stupidly, which wasn't helped at all by the terribly awkward acting.
The plot was a bit too abstract for me and not one moment moved me to fear or even the vaguest concern for the characters. Even the title's tie-in feels sloppily contrived.
And then in top of all that, it was entirely predictable. I kept impressing my husband by guessing the next scene.
Maybe I'm just very difficult to impress. I don't know."
" The Gift that Keeps on Giving
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,8,"Yep, its the usual run of the mill story: couple move into a place and are stalked by someone that may want to do them harm....or does he? Very good film, and please stick it out, as the ending has a great twist.But one question I do wanna know: Why is it in some films (mainly US as the UK has tiny, bendy roads) do people insist of jogging in the middle of the road? What's wrong with that empty pavement?"
" The giving that causes misgivings!
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,9,"There is an old adage implying that it's not gift that matters but the spirit in which it is bestowed. In this movie, many gifts were given from time to time by an old friend to his mate and his wife. Each time the new gift is more mysterious than the previous one. The gift, per se, is always something that the receivers appreciate but slowly they begin to wonder about the spirit in which the gifts are being given.In a sense it is a true psychological thriller because you see nothing sinister or horrible happening on the screen and yet you feel a strong psychological undercurrent of misgiving. The director, Mr. Edgerton, has not resorted to cheap tactics and gory scenes, and yet the film manages to make quite an impact. The script is so good that it hardly needs any artificial embellishments. This is exactly the kind of psychological thrillers that I find very interesting.'The Gift' is beautifully shot and excellently paced. Most of the suspense plays in the mind of the viewer, thus making it an excellent psychological thriller. If you like this particular genre, then give this one a shot. I'm sure you'll find it vastly superior to many that have come before or after."
" The gift of life - Never throw stones in glass houses .
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,6,"A good all round performance by the writer , director and supporting actor Joel Eggerton .
I think this will be better second time round .
I never give away spoilers so with this one it's hard to comment without doing so , it had unexpected twists is all I'm going to say .The casting of Jason Bateman was crucial because you have a preconceived view of him and that's key to the plot .This was good , it wasn't exceptional , the second half was better half and where it became more interesting and less of clicheIt's definitely worth watching and I think a second view might warrant it an 8/10Well done Joel .... and it keeps you guessing at the end which is the secret of a good thriller"
" Yeah, it's a decent little film
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,7,"Ok I won't lie. I had literally never heard of this film at all. I stumbled on it via Amazon Prime and just lumped it on. And in all honesty it's a pretty decent film.It's a slow build up yes, but I believe that it works and is done really well In keeping the suspense going throughout the entire film. An hour in and you still haven't a clue how it's going to end (that's a good thing).
The character development is fantastic and really fits in with the ending of this film also. A lot of the character actions start making sense as all is revealed.The ending: it's a good enough ending, it's left really open ended but still ends if that makes sense. In my opinion it's a little too open ended for my liking, but I can acknowledge that it does work.To finish. It's a good little thriller. Little slow here and there and an open ended ending is why it's a 7/10 and not a bit higher. But please don't take that away from the fact that it's a great plot and a story that really does keep you on edge throughout."
" Go ahead and watch it, you won't regret. A well made suspense triller 8/10 from me.
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,8,"Suspense is well coated and I definitely recommend this. ""You done with the past, past ain't done with you."""
" It was a very welcome surprise
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,8,"I thought it was going to the usual stalker type movie but no it had a much darker side. The acting all round was very good and I did like the ending. I can recommend this movie.It's a warning to the bullies out there, your victims may seek you out."
" Full of suspense, and a savage story
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,7,"Likely Bateman's best performance.The movie is creepy and builds up, ultimately a story about karma and how ones actions can permeate for life.It was audacious in it's punch line, and I feel the twist could have yet been better.In the end we are left pondering whether there were any victors.A good film, nothing special, but solid good."
" A lot of build-up to very little
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,4,I expected a lot more to be honest. There really wasn't much tension to be felt (the only moment I was a bit scared was when I thought Gordo might have killed the dog) and there was no gotcha! feeling at the end to make up for anything. I was really underwelmed at the ending..
" IT WORKS.
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,8,"It's a good movie. The tension grows well, and although it flows slowly, it works. The main plot it's nothing of special, it has already been seen often something like this, but the development of the story it's cool and there isn't lack of upsetting cues. Not perfect, but a good thriller influenced by horror and psychological elements."
" A gift as it says
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,7,Strong immense acting and juts the story revolves around the 3 characters...intense thriller giving us a payful revenge ...suspense and emotionally stable movie not only in screen and in hearts too
" Not too good, not too bad. Has a good message.
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,6,"I wanted to rate this 5.5/10 but you can't do half stars.I will say.. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Jason Bateman's acting, and his humor. There's no humor in this movie, though. I'm sure there's tons more people who know Jason from the show Ozark... but wow has he been in so many things. Basically has been acting his entire life. He's just very well rounded and I'll always watch something with him in it.Then there's Rebecca Hall who plays ""Robyn"".. I first saw her from the movie ""The Town"" (which is one of my favorite movies). The Town I'd rate a 10/10. So she's great, too.This movie, like I said in the title, isn't good nor bad. But it has a message at least. A message that I think is common sense, and even a message that could even be missed when watching it. But it's definitely a message that even if you're aware of, is good to be reminded of. Kind of a ""you never know what could happen"" or ""this could be you"" or ""you never know"".The message in my opinion, in simple terms is... ""Be Kind To Others"". It's as simple as that. Don't be a bully when you're younger cause you may regret it when you're older, LOL. You may be the cool kid in high school, but once everyone's older... it's an even playing field.I've always loved the motto ""Live And Let Live"", which actually has its own definition: ""You should tolerate the opinions and behavior of others so that they will similarly tolerate your own"". I couldn't believe this statement to be more true. You don't have to agree with others.. you don't have to even like others.. you could even absolutely despise someone... BUT JUST TREAT THEM WELL!!! Or keep your mouth closed and don't say anything at all, like our mommas used to tell us, LOL.Now onto the actual movie itself... it was definitely a fun ride I will say. One of the reasons I actually don't think it's a bad movie.. is because surprisingly you actually don't know what will happen next. Some movies no matter the genre you can kind of guess what will happen next... like subtle things. This movie you can't really. And is why this movie I think is also good. So it definitely is a cute little movie that I'm glad I've at least seen once.I'm someone that, if I like something? I'll watch it again in a year or something.. movies & tv shows. I like to end my reviews with mentioning if this is something I'd re-watch or not. I don't think anything too major happened that I'd forget about, for it to seem new again if I watched it in a year... it's definitely just a great one-time-see movie. But I'm glad I've seen it, and do appreciate the message I got from it/got reminded of again."
" the film is good, i would've like a more intense build up and a bit of more solid directing.
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,7,"First, the best things i found here: how the couple's dynamic evolves throughout the movie. i even would say that the whole film is pretty much about what she sees in him at the beggining and at the end: how that journey went. (don't think i'm spoiling not going to explain anything) how they behave as soon as gordo's intromissions became more frequent. the characters change...or at least they change their attitudes while the film is going. you can say there's a bunch of turns here (not exactly twists) that makes you more eager to know what's going on.the music and the light i also found cool. the actors are fine too, can't complain about none of them, and some of the ideas the film present are interesting: the human being is able to change: but do we all change that much? can we forgive and forget? can we learn from our mistakes, all of us? or it's just easier to put a rock under them and live with the perception everybody did the same thing and continue life? without making amends or reflecting about the happenings?now, while i was watching the movie i was enjoying it, but at the same time i was asking myself i wasn't i enjoying the hell out of it.i like thrillers i like to keep guessing, i think some of the characters are cool...what thappened for me that i wasn't loving this? well, first my perceptions: i thought this movie would be more claustrophobic and would have less characters. they even have a bunch but most of them don't have any depth. then i think it's the directing. i feel egerton is a not much experienced with directing and that is visible sometimes. i'm not saying it's bad, i'm saying some scenes could be a bit scarier, more claustrophobic... some of the options of the script mostly in the build up part could have been a bit different. i knew they wanted a slow burn but sometimes they could have gotten a little more intense.all in all is a pretty good thriller that's worth a watch. i don't think is that memorable or intense, but i understand why some people think it is. still i can't complain much. some stuff here was well done and is a pretty solid directing debut for edgerton."
" Sad to see JB this way
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,7,It sucks to see Jason Bateman play a bad person but he does it well like everything else he does!!
" Wasted Potential
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,3,"Guessed the first plot twist within 15 minutes of the movie and was disappointed to know there was nothing really significant after that. Robin's character fell flat and she portrayed the typical flightly, damsel in distress. Her reasoning was rrational too. Her husband, Simon, does a background check on the guy who's consistently at their doorstep and she's mad at her husband? I mean, come on. Plus, her uncomfortableness within the home makes her relapse on pills? Then her addiction is never mentioned or delved into after that. A lot of the plot points felt scattered and misplaced, this being one example. Another example, Simon's random fear of monkeys. Yes, a big bad bully is scared of a butt scratching primate. Then there was that odd mention of molestation and how it was all faked by Simon. If it was a fake rumor then how and why in the world did Gordo's father call him gay and try to murder him? Motives did not make sense in this movie.Now to the 2nd plot twist, where the baby may or may not be Simon's. This was also easy to guess after she suddenly faints and insists it wasn't the pills. I mean, if the protagonist insists they aren't crazy they usually aren't, so one can assume she was raped. In the end Simon is crying in a hallway while his wife is cradles a child with an unknown father. Instead of moping around, Simon can tell his wife and show her, and the courts, the surmountable evidence they have against this nut. But no, the big bully is left to cry in a hallway instead of using rationality. The story would've been better if it was dedicated to defeating that rapist but instead the movie delivers some cheap, sappy lesson on karma."
" Maybe I Watched A Different Movie
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,5,"Not so sure what everyone is excited about. Without giving anything away, this is a by-the-numbers thriller with no surprises and a lot of questions left unanswered. The actors are talented but the script is pitched at a B-movie level. The final shot doesn't even make much sense. It could be that I'm just a jaded old guy that's seen way too many movies that are similar to this one. That being said, here are two things I liked: 1. The dog, Mr. Bojangles, is awesome. 2. The screenwriter does go out of his way to reference Jerry Jeff Walker when explaining how the dog got named."
" so good
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,10,This is a great film. Keeps you interested the whole time. excellent acting all the way through. dont miss this one. no idea how i missed it from 2015!
" superb thriller.........
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,9,"Currently my city under lockdown, watching movies everyday... really enjoyed this movie, gripping plot, couple of scene i literally fall from my seat... enjoyed!!!"
" If you accept the ridiculous premise, the whole thing is garbage
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,2,"First off let me say English is not my first language. But do people in America let other people to break in and fill their pond with fish? That seems like a major break of privacy and you could get restraining order against the guy.But once you believe that that is okay then I guess you'd like the movie. The wife just seems so naive to everything to me, she's basically thanking him for breaking and entering."
" Danke!
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,10,"Verisimilitude achieved by cinematography, lighting, sound/music that would make an USC film student look astonished. In other words, this is an excellent film! Bateman, Hall, and writer/director/antagonist Edgerton delivered the total cinematic package. A film set in Los Angeles and filmed in Los Angles that doesn't feel LA is Hard to do!Great job by all aspects of production.Seacrest-Out!"
" Started good, but falters afterwards - (5.5)
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,6,Watched the movie in Netflix.Category: Slow Paced ThrillerMovie started good and was promising till the first one hour. Later half movie loses its strength and climax was confusing. I felt like proper explanation wasn't given in the end.Acting was excellent.Verdict: One time watch thriller movie.
" Pretty darn good!
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,8,"When I heard this movie could be a little slow, I wasn't looking forward to watching this. I hate it when movies just drag on. But this one wasn't like that. Maybe there were one or two scenes a bit too long or unnecessary, but that's it.From the start until the end every scene becomes more interesting and more suspenseful than the former. The tension is subtle, but sometimes you can really feel the fear.One of the things I liked about this movie is that you actually get some time to think what everything will lead to. You know it builds up to something, but you don't know what.
And another thing that I liked is that I didn't know any of the actors. I guess it's also because I haven't seen a lot of movies in my life. But I don't think the female actor was very famous anyway.Anyway... the movie isn't perfect, but if you like a good thriller and you've seen the very best, then this one is next."
" This fails to reach any heights because
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,4,"...any moron can see a mile off that GORDO is a dangerous loser, a sticky fly, super annoying. When you have a snake in the chicken coup you have to convince not just the characters whose lives are being infiltrated (WATCH THE KING FOR A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS) but also the audience needs to feel conflicted and unsure. At that first dinner party, the way he kept on saying over and over how happy he was for them, his whole presentation etc was very poor as a what if t his guy is a whacko proposition because he SO OBVIOUSLY WAS.. This just made me wanna walk away from Gordo and the couple immediately, as it was just super super predictable from that moment. NO TENSION AT ALL. So im giving this a low score despite Rebecca Hall's beautiful mouth. And liking Edgerton and Bateman heaps. more subtlety less sledgehammer would have made it so much better."
" SICK CHEESY REVENGE FANTASY
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,5,"If you're into that type of thing. a few xlnt moments, but too stretched out, I got impatient for the payoff. Rebecca Hall stands out, best thing to see this for. also Busy Phillips, briefly as overexuberant exec wife is fun."
" An incredible feature film debut
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,6,"SYNOPSIS:
Simon (Jason Bateman) runs into an old classmate, Gordo (Joel Edgerton), when moving back to California for work. At first, Simon and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) think he's just a little off, until it seems he might be tearing their relationship apart.REVIEW:
Bravo Mr. Edgerton. Out of the couple feature films Joel Edgerton has directed, this is definitely the one to watch. This is the epitome of psychological thriller and the delivery is amazing. The acting from Bateman, Hall and Edgerton are amongst the best of all of their filmography. It's a slow burn with great dialogue that allows the plot to build and build without you even realizing how slow of a burn it is. You become encapsulated in the downfall of Simon and Robyn. Knowing as a viewer just how much Gordo has to do with it, while the characters themselves live oblivious. You're waiting and waiting for Gordo to make a move that's over the top, but don't know if it's just the psychological warfare or if Gordo is just the catalyst to a failing marriage. The twist at the end is incredible and just enough to keep the audience thinking beyond the runtime of the film. Available on Netflix as if when I'm posting this so, please, if you haven't seen this film already, do yourself a favor and watch it. 8.8/10."
" Smart thrills
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,7,"Joel Edgerton's directorial debut is a solid thriller about the sins of the past. It's sleek, smart, and well-acted. The climax is well thought out and justifies the slow buildup. It's the perfect resolution to the story and makes you wonder how your past might one day come back to affect your future."
" Don't waste your time
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,2,This movie plays more like anecdote than a short story.. I like Bateman In everything...but he's mis-cast here.
" story was top, plot was flop, -> overall mediocre
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,5,"The story was interesting and I liked it.
The plot, on the other hand, was rather bad because it was a bit boring due to the lack of tension."
" Suspenseful moment to moment
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,7,"The Gift does a great job of creating suspense without having to do anything too outlandish. For the majority of the film, there is an uneasy feeling and a sort of awkwardness that keep it suspenseful. The situations are completely realistic and can be seen in day to day life. Just a solid netflix movie to spend a night with."
" Thank you Mr. Edgerton
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,10,"Finally the most real, honest, straightforward story about bullying ever made. This is beyond good. I didn't expect to like it at all but honestly as a former bully victim, this movie says it all. The real life lasting effect bullying has, the complete denial or refusal of the bully to understand his actions cause and the lack of responsibility or acknowledgment of those effects. This should be a documentary shown in every elementary and middle school."
" A Long 'Un But A Good 'Un.
",2020-03-04 00:00:00,6,"Several times, during the movie, I screamed at the screen because of the stupid decisions the wife, Robyn, made in regards to the stranger. In all honesty, NO ONE would've let this weirdo freak into their homes based on suspicion alone; nevertheless, she did. In the end, this was an important device considering how the tables turned later. Like any worthwhile thriller, this 'un was rife with twists and turns, so no complaints there. Joel Edgerton, being an actor, producer, writer and director of this film did a pretty good job, so in that sense, it's recommended despite the fact it felt a little flat in places."
" Bullies
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,5,"I read a report, a few years ago, that bullies lead Happy, Healthy lives. And those they bullied, live Short, Miserable lives. That is what I like about this movie. It correspond to the reports."
" Twist
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,6,This movie got so great reviews but I was not impressed until the ending that made a good twist on a weird person.
" ""See, you're done with the past, but the past is not done with you.""
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,10,"A great eerie drama/suspense glorious canvas debut for Joel Edgerton! Saw in the theater originally and now own on iTunes happily anytime I watch it I love The Gift. Beautifully acted, immersive story, I feel empathetic for many of the characters and appreciate the dialogue! To me The Gift is a well done art piece that everyone should see and appreciate."

" Great acting
",2019-05-30 00:00:00,9,This movie was the unexpacted. Great atmosphere. Great acting. Great story. It catched me from the beginning till the end.
" Alphas and epsilons
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,7,"The alpha gorilla fights to secure dominance of a troop of females; but within that group, is often a caring and attentive figure. Human beings may not be gorillas, but there may still be certain parallels between us and our ape kindred, as attested by the fact that on one hand the sucessful can afford to be (though are not always) pleasant and generous, but on the other hand, truly nice guys finish last. In Joel Eggerton's film a male executive has a good job, a new house and a loving wife; but is threatened by the threat that his past will be exposed by a former schoolmate who inconveniently reappears in his life. The film is structured quite like a play, but is still quite engaging, although it ends with a few minor histrionics that don't quite fit the overall tone, and it's refusal to take sides, even at the end, is distancing. But I liked the ideas that it explores, and its conviction that our pasts make us what we are."
" Not good.
",2019-04-26 00:00:00,4,"""The Gift"" makes the cardinal sin of movies. It doesn't make sense. A movie doesn't have to make sense in my world (or your world) but it needs to make sense in its own world. ""The Gift"" doesn't. When it's over, anyone who thinks back on what they just watched will realize that the ""The Gift"" is ridiculous. It's fine for a fourteen year old girl slumber party because they'll be so busy talking that they won't notice how bad this movie is. For everybody else, skip it."
" This film is amazing
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,10,"I hate giving 10 stars as I feel like everything can always be improved. But when I try and think of what I would change, I can't come up with anything.The acting in this is outstanding, Jason Bateman is usually a comedy actor, you see a whole new side of him in this film.Blumhouse make some great horror films, this isn't horror, but I felt uneasy the whole way through! The suspense and waiting for the full story to reveal itself is just so powerful.I found myself shouting at my tv begging to know the true tale of events this film is based around. This film leaves you with a sense of unknown and questioning everything long after you turn off the tv.Can't fault this film whatsoever, absolute 10/10."
" Sometimes the bad guys are right in front of us
",2019-04-15 00:00:00,10,"The Gift is a disquieting and utterly uncomfortable practice of karma and how the past always catches up people to bite them square in the butt. Gordo, who we at first think is a total creepo, we end up rooting for because of how much he's suffered and all of the bad stuff Jason Bateman's character had done to him. It's an uneasy movie but it pays off big time.A+"
" TERRIBLE MOVIE
",2019-04-01 00:00:00,2,"Slow, disappointing, anti-climatic and not engaging whatsoever. An absolute waste of time."
" An ""outside the box"" thriller! (7,6/10)
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,7,"This movie is a big innovation in the list of thrillers. Something special and prototypical!!! The movie doesn't include any jumpscares. It's an authentic depiction of how real thrillers should be. The Jason Bateman , a wealthy businessman , came across an old classmate, Joel Edgerton , who behaves weirdly and buy him all the time gifts without any special reason. But why an old classmate wanna come closer to his wealthy "" old friend "" ? Also there is a beautiful acting from Rebecca Hall , the wife of Bateman. This movie is by itself a kind of thriller...One of the best mystery movie of 2015!!!"
" Not the usual, generic crime/thriller movie.
",2019-03-14 00:00:00,8,"This movie was a pleasant and much appreciated surprise, a film that stands out from the majority of the American -crime/thriller- genre productions that we watched in the last few years. ''The Gift'' is a low-key, low-budget film which relies on its great plot and characterization rather than the use of special effects. It is a suspenseful story which begins when the married couple of Simon and Robyn decides to move from Chicago into Simon's hometown in order to make a fresh start, attempting to flee from the -many- problems they had in the previous few years. The exact nature of these problems are gradually revealed to the viewer and we learn the whole truth in a slow, though suspenseful, way. As the couple is shopping for their new home, Simon runs into an old classmate of his, Gordo, whose behavior seems to be a little off at the beginning, and it quickly deteriorates to stalking and criminal actions against the couple.
The riddle that lies on the center of the film's plot is the reason behind Gordo's increasingly bizarre behavior. Robyn will quickly suspect that Simon is not telling her the truth about his past misdeeds and sets off to find out the truth herself. She finally realizes that the person she trusts the most, her husband, is not who she thought he was and this fact aggravates her mental issues, that she successfully dealt in the past, leading to paranoia and total lack of trust in Simon.
What makes ''The Gift'' a different, as well as a highly recommended, thriller is its great finale that leaves the audience hanging but at the same time is the most appropriate ending in this disturbing story of bullying, lies and violence. The movie offers catharsis to the audience in an innovative and ingenious manner, making the ''Gift'', a picture which will remain to the viewer's memory for a long time. I am not a big fan of Jason Bateman but I have to admit that he is decent in his portrayal of Simon and Rebecca Hall is excellent as Robyn. Joel Edgerton, who is also the writer and the director of the film, is convincing in the difficult role of odd Gordo and I hope that we will have the chance to watch him in future productions.
To sum up, ''The Gift'' is a movie that guarantees entertainment and should not be missed by any true fan of the genre."
" Misled by the marketing angle
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,7,"Don't get me wrong, it's a good film. Good wriiting, direction and superb acting. However, as I expected a thriller, I thought the initial pace was very slow, until I found that it was not a thriller at all and the pace went as slow through to the end. You might say it's a mystery drama with a hint of thriller. Thank God the acting kept me going, though, because it delivered good thought provoking story and a good twist."
" The Chinese translation of the title deviates from the connotation of the film
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,7,"The Chinese translation of the title deviates from the connotation of the film. Through music, plot and other means, the whole film creates a kind of frightening atmosphere, but what we really want to talk about is a truth of life. With the true face of the male master being exposed a little bit, the image of the male sophomore becomes more and more flesh-and-blood, and the main body of the film is also revealed."
" Loves it!
",2019-02-11 00:00:00,8,Went in with basic 'Jason's Bateman' expectations and was nicely surprised. He plays a great straight guy and is surprisingly good without having to be humorous.I didn't see the turn coming on his character and that made it all the more interesting.Had enough interest to keep me planted and pausing only to refuel for food and beverage.
" 1 star for a terrible ending!!
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,1,"My Rating: 1/10I, along with many other viewers, found the ending really stupid and it pretty much completely undoes the entire first half, which is brilliant I might add, and reduces the film to a mere cheap cop-out soap story.Really disappointed and feel let down by all the people listing it as a top thriller in their recommendations."
" More like this please Hollywood!
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,8,"This is one of those drama/thrillers that Hollywood does so well when it puts its mind to it. Smart, gripping, great characters surrounded by an interesting and sometimes exciting story. The twists that happen throughout feel real thanks to tight writing which ties in the events of the story to the characters lives both present and historical. Everything just fits and leaves the viewer wanting to see what happens next. The film really belongs to Joel Edgerton who writes, directs and acts. His portrayal of a character with lots going on inside and out is pitch perfect. More like this please Hollywood!"
" Superb film. One of the all time great thrillers.
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,10,What to say about The Gift? Amazing plot. Amazing acting. Great casting. The Gift is expertly plotted and executed by director and lead actor Joel Edgerton. Can't wait to see what he directs in the future in this vein. Jason Bateman's best performance in a feature I've seen. Joel Edgerton as always delivers a perfect performance that intentionally unnerves you and really makes you question his character and motives throughout. Easily one of the most gut wrenching twists in a thriller I've seen in my life. Perfectly executed. Deserves the full 10 out of 10 hands down.
" 'Don't let them in', 'Don't encourage them', 'Don't even try to befriend them'
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,6,"Well enough photographed and performed but there is always a problem for me with films based upon the notion of someone insinuating themselves into the life of another. Far too early, it seems to me, I am leaping out of my seat to shout, the likes of 'Don't let them in', 'Don't encourage them', 'Don't even try to befriend them' etcetera and it puts me at odds with the director's usual intention, to manipulate the viewer as well as the 'victim'. There are a few twists and turns in this but nothing like enough to compensate for being several steps ahead. Its a difficult trick to pull off and although there are a few surprises in this one, it is not enough."
" Seen Cape Fear or One Hour Photo? Great. Then you've seen this.
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,4,"It's a very typical ""stalker movie"" that brings almost nothing new to the table. Don't bother."
" Pretty neat!
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,7,"Although this had some cliche moments, mediocre music and acting, this had a good screenplay and characters. The story of a haunting past catching up with you was executed pretty well."
" Amazingly crafted movie....
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,9,This movie was made just the way movie like this should have been. Nice work by Joel......... Loved it...
" Feels like it could really happen
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,8,"The Gift is a suspenseful movie because it feels like it could really happen. I found myself getting caught up in the story and stressing about what I would do if I were in a similar situation. This unique thriller keeps you guessing the entire time. Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall and especially Joel Edgerton give excellent performances. The Gift is an uncomfortable film, but in an enjoyable way."
" Bret Kavanaugh
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,9,Wow! I didn't know they made a movie loosely based on Bret Kavanaugh?!!!
" I saw Jason Bateman's name and thought I'd give it a look.
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,7,This was out there but I did enjoy the story line and good to see how it ended. I wasn't expecting this and didn't see this ending coming. I had no idea where this was going and it was a nice surprise to not know where this movie was going to go. I remembered Jason Bateman from the past and wanted to see his adult acting skills. He is good and this was good enough to see it through to the end. I like and glad I watched it. It's worth a look see.
" Painfully Average
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,7,"Just watched this move for the second time. When I decided to watch it this time, I didn't realize until two or three minutes into the viewing that I had already seen it. That goes to show you that it didn't leave much of an impression the first time. When I rate a movie 1 to 10, I consider whether the filmmakers involved hit the mark they were going for. A certain movie may not be my cup of tea, but if the filmmakers hit their mark, I usually at least give the movie a 6 or 7. The Gift hits its mark, but that's all it does. It's well crafted, but it brings nothing new to the stalker genre. And the performances are very predictable. The stalker is adequately creepy, the victims are adequately distressed... If you like these kinds of movies and you have nothing better to do, give it a watch but don't expect anything special."
" Just love the movie!
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,10,Interesting flip that make this move very good! Watch it and enjoy!
" Kept me engaged
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,7,It was ok. Love bateman. Ending clever. Worth the watch if u have netflix
" Well worth your time.
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,8,"Fantastic script, acting, and intrigue. Great movie."
" Surprisingly Good, thrilling!
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,9,"I love a good Jason Bateman movie who never disappoints. Actually loved Rebecca Hall and Joel Edgerton. Never expected to root for the ""bad"" guy. Enjoyed it very much, actually loved it. Highly recommend."
" The sins of the past
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,8,"In this movie, married couple Simon and Robyn (played by Golden Globe Winner Jason Bateman and Golden Globe Nominee Rebecca Hall) are happy and healthy, until an old acquaintance from his past named Gordo (played by Golden Globe Nominee and director of the film Joel Edgerton). Gordo seems nice at first, but when Simon is suspicious of his motives, things get twisted really fast and past secrets are revealed. Simon and Robyn have to decide: is the past in the past or are some sins too unforgivable for forgiveness?You should really go and watch the film! It is a beautiful thriller that has an awesome twist for an ending, but I won't spoil it! First off, I gotta give props to Jason Bateman; known mostly for his comedic roles, he decides to switch it up here for dramatic effect and it works! Hopefully he does more dramatic work alongside his comedic roles. Rebecca Hall is also great too as the woman who questions everything she thought she knew about the one person closest to her.But let's face it, if anybody deserves the applause the most, it's Edgerton. As I stated before, not only does he play Gordo, but he is also director and writer for this film. Is this really his first film behind the camera? Because if it is, then it's a strong start for him! Sometimes when a director plays a main character on screen, it can come off as vain, but not here. Edgerton wisely chose another male to take the lead role (Bateman, in this case) and he relishes playing Gordo, the man who seems nice but actually has deeper motives. He knows the character more than anybody and I would be interested in seeing some sort of followup with his character!All in all, it's a great movie! Go and watch it!"
" A get-over
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,3,"See, how they get you is they make you think something's going to happen spectacular and nothing ever does. You will waste your time to come out empty handed. I put this movie in the box of never watch again."
" Simon says go watch this!
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,8,Well worth the time to watch this. Acting is great. Storyline is good well peiced together movie...good thriller.
" Very good
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,7,"Similar premise as the 2013 Czech film "" honeymoon "", but not nearly as disturbing"
" Evil bateman
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,10,"Joel Edgerton is one of my favourite actors. I would marry him. I also enjoy Jason Bateman but I HATE him in this movie! He's such a giant evil jerk in this film! Oh my gosh I wanted to punch him! 
It's a great movie about bullying and revenge and that jerk got what he got what he deserved!"
" Excellent!
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,10,"Jason Bateman! Of all the lovable characters he plays, this was not one of them! From the start, I was calling him a condescending pr!ck, and for good reason. I won't spoil anything. Very good movie, steady tension, great suspense. The actors were amazing, the story line perfect. Nice twists, but all in all, a good moral of the story kind of flick that makes you examine everyone you may have ever bullied! Highly recommend!"
" Much more than what you expect. Watch it!
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,9,"I start watching this movie thinking it would be another ""stalker from the past comes to make a family's life a real living in hell and everything turns out fine at the end"", but no, this movie is a psychological horror-thriller with so many details! And the end.. omg, a really good movie"
" Dark and entertaining
",2018-06-27 00:00:00,7,"Joel Edgerton wrote, directed and acted in this dark mystery-drama and pretty much hit it on every front. It really is disturbing not so much from what you see, but from the right amount of suspense and not revealing too much.Having said that, you need to be in the right mood to see this movie--modern film noir."
" Disturbingly good.
",2018-06-21 00:00:00,6,"Joel Edgerton has some really great films on his resume and seems to be gaining popularity. 'The Gift' was his directorial debut, and if it is anything to go by, I'm sure we can expect amazing films from him. The film has some really great scares, with great acting, and great suspense. Joel himself is wonderful as the antagonist. Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall are equally great, but especially Bateman, me thinks. He's just a natural. The film remains unpredictable throughout and has a very interesting twist, so much so that I really feel sorry for Simon (Bateman). This psychological thriller delivers. It was actually disturbingly good."
" Very good
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed watching it. It was very calm and interesting to see what happenes. 
However, the only one thing I disliked about this film is the sound system they used the would have a silent scene then immediately the will insert this high sound which will make you freak out and jump a little. 
Overall, the story is unique it was unpredictable and well acted cast."
" What a great movie. Well directed and written.
",2018-06-15 00:00:00,9,"The Gift is an awesome thriller. The suspense it builds up with the great direction and storyline is amazing. The proper timing, sound effects, everything is so perfect that this thriller can even scare you more than a creepy creature of a horror movie might fail to do. Acting is really good too, cinematography is gorgeous, and the movie will throughout hold the attention till the very end. Also, best part is how wisely this movie delivers a great message without losing the quality of entertainment. It shows the relationship and a life of a couple closely, but more than that it shows how the little things of past, that we think are little things can have very big consequences sometimes.
Overall, I really loved this movie and recommend it."
" It doesn't have a clear focus of where the story goes, but the idea sounds intriguing
",2018-05-24 00:00:00,5,"It's a revenge picture, but the revenge doesn't entirely add up. It isn't really a horror movie, it's a psychological thriller, but didn't really thrill me. It doesn't make much sense, even though it had an interesting idea for a story and good performances, but the twists either aren't clear or aren't there. The pacing sometimes dragged, too."
" Such a great psychological thriller
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,10,"I went in with the lowest expectations after having watched the trailer to this movie which makes it seem like a really corny horror movie (whoever was in charge of marketing needs to be fired because i would have actually seen this in theaters if it was marketed appropriately). Its not a corny horror movie at all! its definitely one of the best psychological thrillers I have ever seen. I was writing a few business emails at the time so i put it on as background noise (assuming it was going to be stupid) but i immediately started paying attention when things started getting complicated, which is relatively quickly.I know this will expire soon, but its on netflix as of 5/20 and definitely deserves a watch."
" Creepy behaviour!
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,8,"A psychological thriller that builds gradually, with an impressive ending! Exceeds my expectations, I tend to think of Jason Bateman as a comedy actor, but all characters we're enjoyed, as the plot thickens!"
" Creepy and clever story. But in the end the suspense deflates a bit like a balloon when the plot is explained.
",2018-04-30 00:00:00,6,"A couple relocates after a miscarriage to a new town to make a new fresh start. Suddenly they get stalked by an old schoolfriend who just happens to live in the same new neighbourhood. However weird he might act and however obnoxious he might be in coming to see them uninvited over and over again he doesnt break any law perse. He is just somewhat weird and wants contact when the couple didnt ask for any friendship. The couple decide to bluntly tell the guy that they dont ever want to see him again. After that weird things start to happen around the house. That is the creepy part. The reason that creepy things start to happen around their new house is the clever part of the story. But at the end of the movie I felt a little disappointed. The great suspense kinda deflated at the end when I knew why everything happened the way it did. All in all certainly an entertaining creepy movie about stalking and about a lot more which I cant explain right now, because of spoilers. Story could have been better. And the drama could have been intenser. In the end it felt like a somewhat unbelievable story that spoiled the very good suspense of the first half of the movie. But then again this is often the case with movies that depend on the plot, it either is believable or it is somewhat cheesy cheap. This one is in between. 7 stars."
" Ending needs work.
",2018-04-11 00:00:00,5,"The beginning of this movie was extremely intriguing and unpredictable. I found myself looking forward to each upcoming screen. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with the ending it was dull. It left you wondering what the heck was going on. I truly wish there was some kind of resolution or a suggestion of a plan. The movie initially had me on the edge of my seat but the ending definitely ruined it for me and left me baffled. If you enjoy unfinished movies I would definitely recommend this to you. Enjoy!"
" Enticing but predictable
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,4,"Ok, yea it kept me interested. but starting off, the way the guy introduced himself to the couple should have raised a flag to her husband. If he did what he did to the guy, he would have remembered it and put a stop to his intrusions immediately. Just a few more issues that makes it unbelievable and outrageous. First. The guy shows up at the house the 1st time un-invited while her husband is at work. With her husband knowing the past between them, he should have addressed it immediately. When he shows up the second time, while he is at work, the ditzy wife should have put a stop to it instead of inviting him in again. Only a pollyanna would have considered him safe at this point. Well, it it was me, at this point, I would have confronted him for sure.Second, after all the conformations and both of them being aware that he has been getting in their house when they are not home, at least change the locks. The seem to be well off. They seem to have an alarm system that isn't working so well . Get it fixed, replaced, hire private security.By the time she passed out drinking the water she got from her fridge, and given how her husband had bullied him, it was all downhill and predictable. As for leaving us up in the air by not knowing if the new born father was the husband, Simon or Gordo, well this must have been written before we had DNA testing. A quick DNA test would determine who the father is, add in the video he got from Gordon in bed with his wife passed out, even with his monkey mask. Given the video and DNA test. If it was Gordo's kid, a prosecutor just out of law school would easily convict him.Sorry, it didn't impress me with the idiotic actions of the characters and it's easily predictability.One other possible ending is, Gordo told her it was his baby. Look at her face when Simon run's back in the hospital and sees his wife, in the nursery, about to start to breast feed her baby. She accepted, it since she had a soft spot in her, for Gordo from day one, even if he did rape her. She wanted a kid, and it was obviously, she no longer wanted to be with her bully husband, let alone a kid with him. So, when she is told it is not Simon's kid, she was content. Gordo did fake the injured arm when he tossed the arm sling away. Maybe that extra sympathy was enough to give him a pass on raping her. To me, this is the more probable ending. Again, given her look, as she is about to breast feed her baby, she accepted it, I think Gordo gets away with the rape. After all, she did allow him to come in her home, un-invited and without her husband present in more than one occasion. Proof enough to tell me she like him more than her husband, especially after she uncovered his past and how he got his promotion."
" Worth the watch
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,8,"As thillers normally go, the plot moves slowly giving you tiny little pieces of the puzzle, until the end when the final twisting piece of the puzzle is in place and the entire puzzle picture is revealed! Solid movie start to finish, keeps you interested, and brings you to the edge of your seat!"
" The great gift is great performances
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,8,"When I was reviewing film professionally, to me the great joy was watching brilliant actors bringing their characters to life on the screen. I had my favourites: Meryl Streep, Ellen Burstyn, Geraldine Page and, from left field, the Australian Wendy Hughes. And those magnificent males, Ben Kingsley, Brian Dennehy who were naturals like Spencer Tracy before them. I rarely see their quality anymore, due mainly to Hollywood's current obsession with superheroes, animation in all its forms, pyrotechnics and make-believe technology as a whole. But here's a gift, a genuine, realistic human drama, seamlessly directed by Joel Edgerton with the wonderfully talented Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall in sublime form. The great performances reveal an emotional range which, let's face it, are beyond Clint Eastwood, Nicholas Cage and Jennifer Lopez, with apologies to their fans. Bateman and Hall are perfectly cast; Edgerton's screenplay carries the edge in his name and the serpentine twists, and turns, kept me riveted throughout. The peripheral performances are likewise engaging. I note that the estimated budget is a mere five million. Really? Rarely has a gift given so much for so little. Highly recommended."
" Spoiler
",2018-03-15 00:00:00,8,"Behold, the unusual protagonist! So clever, but not very satisfying. I was captivated, but concurrently annoyed. Do watch, but don't hold high expectations above a 5. I LOVE Jason Bateman, and the acting is superb. Have at it while drinking with friends and accomplishing other things, but do have at it!"
" Very good movie !
",2018-03-13 00:00:00,9,I gave the movie a 9/10 just for the fact that they leave you on a cliff.I just want to know if the baby is Gordo's or Simon's!!! This movie had my feeling all sorts of emotions throughout and it was very well told. I would highly recommend this movie.All in all. Don't be a Simon.
" This was garbage
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,1,So slow and so boring. A huge waste of time. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did. Save yourself and don't bother.
" 204. The Gift
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,9,"It's like a really dark sequel to Arrested Development and you find out that Michael is really the most evil member of the Bluth family. Don't know what I mean, let me explain, well, this movie not Arrested Development, which is a great show, Ron Howard wanted me to spread the word. So we meet Simon and Robyn have just moved back to Simon's' hometown and are quickly recognized by Gordon, who seems very nice and pleasant and is nothing but kind to the couple. However Gordon and Simon are already acquainted from way back in the days of high school. And Gordon becomes overly attached and goes above and beyond making them comfortable, uncomfortable so. Unannounced visits, creepy gifts just left on the door step. So Simon finally says enough, get lost. Not before one last present with a note stating that he was sorry and wanted 'bygones to be bygones', and its that statement that gets Robyn saying, hmmm, is this not one sided. So she does a little digging and well, Simon may be a wicked douche, and everything that happens next may be a carefully planned out revenge of a bullied teenager, or it may not. Super creepy, written, directed by, and starring Joel Edgerton. Such a satisfying ending :) Good job Joel. Also starring Michael Bluth, oh I mean Jason Bateman, who I can see being a douche, he's good dont get me wrong, but theres a certain level of douche-baggery to him. And Rebecca Hall, who always does a great job playing emotional characters! Check this one out!https://www.facebook.com/filmbufftim"
" Excellent Film
",2018-03-08 00:00:00,8,"If you like a movie that constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat (in the psychological sense) and thinking, then you're gonna love this. Mystery and intrigue abound in The Gift, which at no time slows down or gives the viewer a break from the action. On top of a simply great story with all the trimmings that make for a good film, there's also a bit of a moral to take away. I don't often say it, but this one really is a must-see."
" ""Gordo the Weirdo"" is My Kind of Leading Man
",2018-03-07 00:00:00,9,"When you first start watching this film, you think that Simon is the leading man and Robyn is his leading lady and la de da they move back to Simon's hometown and this guy they run into, ""Gordo the Weirdo"" is your potential antagonist. And, depending on how you react to the events that occur throughout the course of the movie, you might still think that.I think this film does a great job of flipping traditional hero/anti-hero ideas and typical protagonist/antagonist roles. Joel Edgerton is a gem. I'd seen him in other things (The Great Gatsby, Star Wars Episodes II and III, Kinky Boots) but this role, and knowing that he wrote and directed, as well as starred, knocked my socks off. I'm glad he made this film, and I think it is extremely well done. If you like slow burn psychological thrillers with a whole lot of tension and cringey moments, this is a must-see."
" You may be done with the past, but the past is not done with you.
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,7,"Simon (Jason Bateman) and his Chicago wife Robyn (Rebecca Hall) move to near his old home in California for his job. While shopping, they bump into Gordon (Joel Edgerton) Gordo the Weirdo, an old high school acquaintance of Simon. Simon tries to blow him off, but Gordo forces his way into his life in a very creepy fashion. As it turns out, the two have a history, that becomes a mystery that needs to be uncovered.While the film was well acted, the plot was ""low energy"" to quote a campaign phrase. I didn't feel the intensity as I never felt Gordo was a real and convincing threat. Robyn came across as a basket case by design, so her concerns became downplayed.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Nobody told a story like this before
",2017-12-31 00:00:00,8,"I will not repeat other reviewers' praises about the fine acting of the three main artists, or the good script and directing. This is the first story I know about the ""aftermath"" of bullying, while almost any movie or novel about bullying shows kids bullying other kids.
I'd like to remark that it's still doable a movie which deals with horrible topics without showing almost anything actually horrible or violent or bloody. I mean that this is a movie in a Hitchcock-style. And I liked it."
" Edgy and tensely entertaining **NO SPOILERS**
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,8,"This film is superbly entertaining in a film type that's been done to death. Joel Edgerton has made a really enjoyable thriller here.A few moments have glorious jumps and unexpected bumps. A dark second half of the film is very welcome. The vagueness of getting to grips with who are the good guys and who are the bad make this a very original plot where it could just have been a copycat film.Bateman is effortlessly good in this as all things, but for me, Rebecca Hall is the star here. She is just mesmerisingly good.Top film. A creepy 8 out of 10 for me"
" Pretty good!
",2017-11-21 00:00:00,7,"Nice cinematography, fitting soundtrack, convincing performances, awesome ending, quite suspenseful, interesting and smart. But I felt that the dialogue could have been more subtle, the first half was slightly repetitive and it also had some messy pacing (too many time jumps and little montages)"
" Predictable and slow
",2017-09-21 00:00:00,6,"What I found good in this movie was the acting part. The movie was well played, especially the acting of Gordon was very good. The story is also interesting, and apart from clichés. As the movie goes on, it keeps the audience wondering about what is the truth to the story. Although it kept me watching with curiosity, I was kind of bored because of its slow progress. The ending was not that surprising as I expected that it would be. The cinematography was also quite good, as being one of the things that kept me watching.After all, I am not very glad to see this movie, but I also do not regret it because of the interesting story."
" Outstanding debut
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,8,"The Gift is a psychological thriller of rare efficacy and beauty in these times. It is Joel Edgerton's debut as director who also carves out the role of the villain and his role is surely the most impressive, better played and also better written (by Edgerton himself).Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall also do a good job, but the Australian actor (and director/writer) steals the scene, even though he isn't the main protagonist.About the ending, I like it. I've read someone criticizing the fact that you don't understand who is the real father of the baby. But I think that the last 10 minutes are perfect as they are. Edgerton's performance is outstanding: he really acts like a fool, with a frightening gaze.One of the best thriller films of the last years. Deserves more than a viewing."
" A deliberately paced mystery thriller that unveils a flesh-crawling finale
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,9,"Writer/director Joel Edgerton's The Gift is about a happily married couple trying for a baby, whose lives are turned upside down when an acquaintance from the past shows up at their new home, presenting gifts and accompanied with a threatening agenda. You can't gauge where it goes from there because of the unpredictability of the smart script. The trailer was deliberately average, giving away nothing so as to lower your expectations before heading in, only to unabashedly shatter that miscalculation with a sledgehammer; it hits you hard and then leaves a lingering sting, an acrid touch you can't shake off.It's a slow film that takes careful time to evolve across its run-time, a genre entry that's wicked and subversive and disturbing, ultimately proving to be worth the wait. (Though nothing can prepare you for what will eventually be revealed). Patient viewers will be responsive to the series of subtle thrills that lead up to its truly flesh-crawling final scenes – an ending that'll leave you suitably unsettled – and a well-placed score contributes immensely to where and when you should feel uncomfortable before the big payoff. The mystery thriller also contains a range of strong performances; from Joel Edgerton's creepy, misunderstood antagonist; to Jason Bateman's slyly corrupted protagonist harbouring long-buried secrets; and finally the unknowing victim of the whole ordeal, Rebecca Hall, playing Bateman's sympathetic wife - every actor garners attention for their nuanced work in this critically acclaimed, underseen hit.The Gift registers a couple of effective jump scares whilst it works at getting under your skin, and that application here is through skillful work of creating an atmosphere thick with tension and hostility to embed its narrative within. Without that considerate build-up of suspense, the jump moment's hold no purpose, making you eye roll at another ineffective use of sometimes cheap tricks or scare tactics to illicit reactions in viewers. Joel Edgerton solves that simple, missable opportunity with an excellently taut atmosphere. (Something most horror films cannot do).The seeds are planted early for what will inevitably happen, growing insidiously before transforming into something utterly diabolical, delivering a deliciously nasty finale; a fate so ambiguous it's haunting. Everything collapses in on our protagonist at the end, someone we liked at the beginning (but had no reason to), and then feel nothing for him by the conclusion (by this point we have motive to). The moral of the story is simple – everything has consequences, and the past will find you, judge you and, if need be, provide deliverance or comeuppance. In Joel Edgerton's chilling directorial debut, the latter is rightfully earned; the ultimate revenge.9/10"
" If this was a gift i wouldn't keep it.
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,5,"This film seems to get a lot of positive ratings,well everybody's different and entitled to their opinion. My opinion is that it is very contrived and a big fuss about nothing. When the plot is revealed, none of the characters are blameless. The Joel Edgerton character is creepy, the Jason Bateman character untrustworthy and the Rebecca Hall character annoying. People talk about the Hitchcock references but all they show for me is how superior Hitchcock films are to this uninviting and forgettable film. Didn't really do a lot for me."
" Wow! Amazing. Surprisingly great.
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,10,"I would give this movie a 9.5 out of 10. This movie was surprisingly good and has opened my eyes to how intelligent thrillers can be. I don't want to spoil it for anyone or raise expectations too much since I am new to the genre. Just most movies I have seen in this category are not typically of this caliber. This one was really well thought out. The plot was very well woven together. All the story lines and details came together. At the same time, everything you think might happen gets turned on its head. ;-) Clichés are gone.The movie stars Simon and Robyn, a newly wed couple moved from Chicago come back home to LA where Simon grew up for a new job. Quickly into the movie, Simon bumps into a old childhood classmate named Gordo. As Simon puts it though, ""Gordo seems a bit off."" Very rapidly, the chance encounter escalates. Gordo ends up around more often than Simon would like. The encounters are awkward and uncomfortable but seemingly harmless, right? However, this movie really turns typical conventions on its head. The good guy and bad guy lines are very blurred. The movie lighting, casting, sound, and dialogue are all very strong. The actors all portray the appropriate emotion at the right time. There is just enough subtly to keep things interesting and mysterious. There is just enough excitement to keep you guessing about what's going to happen next.I am shocked this is not a more well known movie.Very well done!"
" What goes around.... always comes around.
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,8,"Sooner or later, we all star questioning about what Karma really is or really means on our daily lives.... this movie takes it to a whole different level. Like it or not, most of us played the bully role against others without realizing the consequences then... this movie depicts that scenery perfectly.Well written, well played and specially well narrated... this is a good movie, that will make some think about what they did in the past and how they should face it."
" Middling psycho thriller
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,5,"THE GIFT is an all-too-familiar psycho thriller, a labour of love for actor Joel Edgerton who wrote and directed the piece as well as playing the psycho, whose motivations are better-written than usual for the genre. Unfortunately the film itself is a somewhat laidback production, one which lacks the tension that marks the best of the genre. The storyline feels familiar and too slow, and you never really invest in the lives of the main characters; Jason Bateman is perhaps too good at playing his jerk of a character, although British actress Rebecca Hall is very convincing for her part. The film has some decent twists and surprises at times, but the ending peters out to a real anticlimax that does nothing but make the viewer feel let down."
" I was on the edge of my seat!
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,9,"'The Gift' is one of the most enthralling thrillers I've seen in a long time. It ticks all the boxes and has everything you would want in a mystery thriller film. The plot has you hooked from the start, it has an incredibly eerie feel to it and, like all good thrillers, it has a few big twists that most people won't see coming.Towards the end of the film, as the story unravels and a dramatic ending is set up, I was genuinely on the edge of my seat. Very rarely does a film grip me like 'The Gift' did. The ending is satisfying in that, unlike a lot of other thrillers, it felt like it had been well thought out and designed for maximum effect, rather than just a cheap way out.Overall, 'The Gift' was very impressive. It's not very often that a film has me hooked from the first scene to the last, but this one managed it. Probably one of the best thrillers of the 2010s."
" **
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,4,"This was certainly no gift of a picture. I found it very slow moving and we're left with the idea that when you meet someone after such a long time, it's not that great to pursue the meeting as old things will be brought up from years ago.We see the married Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall move from Chicago to California for his new business venture and a beautiful home.In a chance meeting, he comes across a fellow who he knew from high school from years back. The guy lies almost about everything and is practically stalking them and even kidnapping their dog along the way.As is the usual case, the truth eventually comes out but by then you're practically fast asleep or bored out of your mind."
" Well Made Joel Edgerton!
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,7,"If you never seen a trailer of this movie or have read anything about it, stop here and enjoy a good thriller! If you have heard of the basic concept of this movie, you probably know where the story goes and what will happen. So if you expect something special and you're hyped for this movie, do yourself a favor and lower them.Because Joel Edgerton is delivering a very good debut as writer and director. I did not find this stalker movie very thrilling, but i liked the characters and their stories. All of the three main actor where great and perfect for their roles. There where some disturbing images and i felt uncomfortable in some scenes.So for a enjoyable thriller night with some drama and thought, take the ride and watch ""The Gift""."
" Simply Outstanding
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,10,"I have watched this movie more than a few times. It is simply outstanding. Joel Edgerton as the writer of this impressive script, actor, and director did an outstanding job juggling these roles-- pulling off an exceptional production. The cast is perfect. I wouldn't supplant one actor for another. It manages to be poignant and mysterious without being uncomfortably disturbing--which is cool. The psychological intrigue and suspense obviates the need for the typical default blockbuster distraction. There are layer upon layers of visceral exchanges that make this movie, hands down, one-of-a-kind. This is one of my favorite movies of all times---and that's saying a lot. It would be great if Joel Edgerton chose to write a ""The Gift II"" or whatever he might choose to call it. This movie is perfectly set for a sequel that could be equally as suspenseful. It would be even greater if the exact same cast was kept intact."
" This is how thrillers should feel like
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,8,"Went in to see this movie with high expectations and this didn't let me down. It is a proper thriller with a great story, great acting and great direction.The story is superb. Its original and exciting. A viewer will for sure feel all the awkwardness,fear,uncertainty,contempt and the jump scares to their bones. The director did everything perfectly. He showed just enough, nothing more nothing less. I liked this style a lot.On the acting side Bateman and Edgerton were extraordinary. Rebeca Hall was pretty great but these two were the main reason this was so exciting and frightening to watch. I didn't think Bateman could do serious stuff this seriously to be honest.It was a thriller and it thrilled me every moment I was watching it. Loved it and I think it completely deserves all the praises its getting from everyone."
" Can't understand these high ratings
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,3,"This movie doesn't even have an argument... The whole situation could have been solved at first 15 minutes and we wouldn't have lost almost 2 hours. Acting is decent, but all is so obvious and predictable, than what's not is just ridiculous. Finally, it fails trying to teach a kind of lesson."
" joel edgerton directs mini-masterpiece, jason bateman awesome
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,10,"i watched this film the other night, not expecting much, boy was i wrong... i have not seen a revenge film as good and as balanced as the master Peckinpah. the fact edgerton acts and directs this film makes him an absolute true talent. it has hints of hubert selby jr, it has you right from the start. jason bateman's acting is superb. he nails this DRAMATIC role, i would easily say this is his best acting role ever caught on film, if edgerton continues to make films like this, he could become a legend, i can't fault the film. i think we have found a new great director. go joel"
" surprise
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,9,"a couple living in a glass house in la reconnect with an old buddy of the husband Jason bateman. joel Edgerton is the old friend. strange things start happening and it looks like joel is the culprit. Jason plots revenge. I, as well as studio heads, wish to know how to make a big hit movie. no one saw this film and that's a shame. it's intelligent, well acted, original, tense and full of surprises. when you start to think it's a by the numbers thriller it turns 180 and becomes a really good thriller."
" Different take on a thriller
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,7,"The Gift is a suspense thriller surrounding towards the evolution and life of a newly home renovate couple, moving into California. While the film is not necessarily terrifying or violent, it does provide similar traits employed frequently in a typical shocker, from numerous jump-scares to looming hallway shots and sinister themes. The film appeared less of a horror thriller and more of a psychological thriller, with little to no violence which is what many have thought there would be of.The cast delivers, though the ending of the film is somewhat unsatisfactory when thought upon. As it feels more like it was rushed. Gordo (Joel Edgerton) was eerie in a creepy way but it was wondered how far he really could have went, which was not as bad as one to assume. The Gift is an interesting watch with several decent plot twists as it keeps you guessing."
" Sometimes I just can't understand the audience here!
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,2,"I mean 7.1 out of 10? Are you serious? Let's start, shall we?1- I know that the idea was the guy didn't change and he is still a bully, but really, they were kids! Most of us got into some problems just because of other kids at that age!2- Rebecca Hall was horrible, I mean come on, the lady has no expressions! I also get the idea that she's supposed to be depressed, paranoid, etc., but she was THAT bad!3- Your boy got himself into something, he may have or have not raped the lady, OK, at this point, they can do some DNA test to know if the baby is the dad's or not, if not, Gordo the weirdo will face some serious charges: breaking and entering, drugging, being on a private property without an authorization, violating the restraining order and raping, I can see an easy 25 five to life for this guy, and for what? To get back at the bully? Great plan, throw your life away in prison to prove that you ARE a loser."
" Terrific psychological horror
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,7,"Since their first horror movie 'Insidious', Blumhouse productions have made way for different and ingenious movies that were not only specialised on low budget but high on quality. They ended the trend of horror remakes that started mainly in 2002. The film wasn't exactly groundbreaking but it created a larger market for PG 13 movies. Their recent movie 'The Gift' is not really a horror film but falls more in to the category of psychological genre.Directed by Joel Edgerton who also happens to write and direct, the movie is about a couple who's lives are changed by the entry of a high school acquaintance from 25 years ago. Initially he offers gifts as a way of being accepted and desires to become a friend. His socially awkward behaviour is noticed by the husband and the stranger responds in a hostile manner by creating more tension and leading the wife in to the situation. Skeletons fall out of the closet and later background history regarding Gordon is exposed as well as what happened between him and the husband. Things escalate in to bad things and the stranger then unleashes his evil plans.The unique element of the film is clearly the script. Debutante director Edgerton maintains the suspense and intrigue elements throughout the movie. There.is rarely a dull moment. The first hour is straightforward but the the second hour is more unique. However what makes 'The Gift' different is that the audience doesn't know who Stranger is and what his intentions are. This keeps the viewer in suspense and mystery. The cinematography and direction should be given it's due recognition. Many scenes are shot close frame and the interiors of the home filmed in wide view give a haunting atmosphere. Edgerton has had done a commendable job in the directing department and many scenes are to a technical standard. This is not the first time a movie has been made with this theme. Many people will still remember Films like 'Cape Fear' and 'Fatal Attraction' and 'Old Boy' instantly as they fall under the same genre.I'm certain many would disagree but I was quiet annoyed with Robyn's role. As far as Rebecca Hall's acting is concerned, she gave a good performance and was very convincing as the wife. However I couldn't help feeling there was some adjusting required to her involvement to the story. She helped progress the story forward. But I felt she was crossing the limit with digging in to her husband's past. I'm sure she wouldn't like it if he did the same. Whatever Simon did 25 years ago had no connection to their relationship or marriage. He was there to comfort and emotionally support her when she had a miscarriage. This is clearly the reason why perhaps a flashback would have been necessary in the middle of the film to show to what extent Simon had damaged Gordon's life. This is sub standard sub plot procedure that would have benefited the film. I do not endorse what Simon did but I would have hated him more if we were shown in a little more detail the extent of harm he had done to Gordon's life.All actors gave a fantastic performance. Due to the nature of the film one would expect the mysterious character to have the better performance. But in this case I felt Jason Batemen out shined the others. He proves that as well as being comedy material he too can pull off serious roles. Rebecca Hall did her part well as the wife, who I actually ended up hating more than the husband. Joel Edgerton plays his character was ease. There was limited involvement from him in the second half. But I personally feel that his positive contribution stands out more in the directing and scripting. The highlight of the film has to be the confrontation scenes between Bateman and Edgerton. And the surprise ending just added the cherry to the cake. For those who enjoy this genre or if the theme is relatable, I can guarantee will enjoy this treat."
" Fascinating
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,8,"But I would have named it something else.Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall, and Joel Edgerton, who wrote and directed, star in ""The Gift,"" an overlooked film from 2015. Guess everyone was too busy with the blockbusters.Bateman and Hall are Simon and Robyn, who have moved to Chicago to California for a ""fresh start."" We don't know too much about why they needed one, except that it had something to do with Robyn's miscarriage and pill- taking.Simon runs into Gordo (Edgerton) who reintroduces himself and says that he and Simon attended high school together. In the days that follow, Gordo drops by the house with gifts and invites them to dinner. It's an awkward event, with Gordo leaving in the middle of the evening to take a call. Both Robyn and Simon are uncomfortable, and When Gordo returns, Simon tells him that he needs to stay away from both of them.A few bad incidents occur at Simon and Robin's house, and Simon is sure Gordo is responsible. Simon also learns that Gordo does not live in the house where they were to have dinner. He does send them an apology letter and asks that they ""let bygones be bygones,"" which Robyn finds strange.Finally, a horrible secret from years ago emerges, and a pregnant Robyn must cope with what she learned at the same time there is a change at Simon's place of business.This is a wonderful film, a psychological drama where what seems to be going on is only part of the story. All the actors do a terrific job - Jason Bateman uses his natural delivery to good advantage here and turns in a wonderful performance. Rebecca Hall plays Robyn as a fragile and nervous woman determined to adjust to her new home and life. She's totally believable. As the awkward, odd Gordo, Joel Edgerton is excellent, coming off as sort of creepy or just weird.Highly recommended, this is a thought-provoking film."
" Well worth a watch!
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,8,"Gordo is weird. He's always been weird.But first...Simon (Bateman) and Robyn (Hall) move to, Simon's old stomping ground in California from Chicago due to his promotion. Happy couple on the up and up? Maybe. So off they go to buy furniture for their lovely new house.Enter, Gordon (Edgerton) aka Gordo. A chance meeting in the furniture store happens when Gordo spots Simon and recognises him and introduces himself, Simon takes some memory jogging but gets there in the end. Something isn't quite right about Gordo.Then the unexpected gifts and day time visits begin and Robyn, being too nice for her own good, repeatedly lets Gordo in. He's creepy but seemingly without malice until he spots Simon's less than charitable assessment of Gordo pinned to the fridge...From this point on nice but harmless Gordo takes a sinister turn, though Robyn can't decide if it's all in her mind or not and Simon becomes increasingly determined that she shouldn't worry about Gordo and equally unwilling to shed light on what is meant by ""let bygones be bygones"" in Gordo's parting letter.With seeming little else to do but run, drink sports drinks and keep house Robyn does some digging and uncovers what a shining example of a bully her husband once was and how a vile but baseless story from his past ruined Gordo's life.Simon continues with his career and wins another promotion, Robyn gets pregnant and barring the non-materialising threat of Gordo lurking in the background all seems well until the guy who Simon quietly stiffed out of the promotion arrives mid-dinner party and reveals that Simon knows all his old tricks and is still quite happy to use them. Robyn chooses this moment to go into labour.One birth later, Robyn drops the bombshell that she won't be returning with Simon, the revelations about her husband's character are too much for this new mum...as they are for his employer.Newly unemployed Simon returns home to shower in preparation for his attempt to save his marriage where he is greeted by four new gifts each more chilling than the next...I've said enough.The three main characters are excellently played, the script feels natural and the theme of moral duplicity leaves you with thoughts like; ""Poor Simon..but Karma's a bitch"", ""Poor Gordo...but you are a sick puppy!"" and ""Poor Robyn, she didn't deserve to get stuck in the middle of this!""It kept us guessing, Gordo's revenge is both fiendish and a brutal and my fiancée pretty much crushed my fingers thanks to the almost constant tension the film builds.Well worth a watch."
" Solid psycho thriller
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,6,"I hesitated longtime to buy this DVD but the the reviews here convinced me finally to give The Gift a chance. In fact, I was not disappointed and I spent an interesting and suspenseful evening with my wife. The story carried me and my wife in a very curious or let's say mysterious trip. I mean you never saw the coming plots and sometimes there were some scary scenes. All the actors played their roles respectably and the direction well done. At the end the movie turns really unexpected with no happy end but I don't want to spoil more here. I give a 7 and my wife a 6 that gives 6.5/10. Check it out and let's surprise you.If you like this kind of genre I recommend you the other two psycho thrillers The Game and Falling Down starring Michael Douglas"
