" A Gentle Revelation
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,8,"If you are expecting dramatic violence, loud thrilling music and slowed down close up shots then you're in the wrong place.The surreal beauty of this movie lies in how gently the story unfolds. It takes us by the hand and shows us around the dunes of Timbuktu and the life in that desert. However, it does not shy away from showing the regressive opression of the Islamic fundamentalists who have taken up to policing the place. They are so determinded to impose their morals that they scout the place at night spying even for musical sounds.The brutality of their ""punishments"" is raw but even that is shown in a less aggressive manner I suppose. It's like saying ""it ain't personal, this is just the law"" as they carry out extremely violent inhumane tasks. However, small acts highlight how even they are just humans albeit not like ""us"". There's a scene when a convict climbs on a jeep to be driven to his spot of exectuion and one of the ISIS police gives his hand to help him up.I am not at all supporting any of these mad men and their hopes of heavenly virgins. However, we often seem to forget that these people are indeed just men and we humans are capable of extreme monstrosity. This movie just reminds us of this.Extremely beautifully shot, directed and acted. Give this movie a try. I think most of us will like this one."
" Boring
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,4,"What's different or great about this movies. I found it very boring finished the entire movie by fast forwarding . Number of movies & documentaries are made on so called jihadis , criticising them and Islam won't deny this people don't commit attrocities yes they do. Would like to see intelligent film makers make a honest film on US invasion in oil rich countries, destabilising it, killing hundreds of innocent civilians every day. When we say we care for human, human life, human rights then we need to be honest.
Frankly this innocent civilians are not dying for you to make a movie on them and get awards"
" Cinema Omnivore - Timbuktu (2014) 7.4/10
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,7,"""A ball-less football match is poetic but a too blunt metaphor, an act of defiance of music-playing is in default of any context. Sissako is a proficient, morally upstanding filmmaker but somewhat for want of tact, encumbered by the inexpressiveness of the cast (save Ahmed, whose soulful eyes and heartfelt plea are the grace notes), TIMBUKTU is a mild-tempered apologue with simple-minded characters in its center, but that doesn't mean their inner thoughts should be expressed repeatedly in concise, tired wording. If anything, TIMBUKTU suffers from a competent script to connect its strewn vignettes altogether and inject more verve into its sluggish momentum and poised denunciation to Islamic fundamentalism, it is an estimable enterprise, but not a chef-d'oeuvre.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
" A HEARTBREAKING YET STRANGELY HOPEFUL STORY.
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,8,"An interesting portrayal of life in Timbuktu, Mali, under Jihadist rule. It tells the story of a neglected population facing the horror by the Jihadist occupation. It's raw, honest, down to earth, heartbreaking yet strangely hopeful story."
" ""Islamist repression in Azawad""
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,7,"This movie is about the repression of the people of Timbuktu by the ansar dine jihadists, this time bearing ISIS flags, and takes place in azawad in between october 2012 and the serval operation of january 13th. The movie is beautifuly shot, and present many contradictions in the autoritary figures of the islamists, which could also be taken as contradictions in every revolutionary struggle as struggle for power, like the character of abdelkrim, smoking and wanting to use his position to flirt with the tuareg woman setima, or talking about football, while all sports are being banned under sharia law. It also shows a lot of resistance from the people of the city. The movie is very surprising as in a sense, only the main family of characters is tuareg, while most of the base of the ansar dine was composed of a faction of the movement for the liberation of azawad, which allied themselves to the al-qaeda for the islamic maghreb, who seem to be the only one portrayed in the movie. The topic of the independence of Azawad is absent from the movie, as it was from the news coverage at the time of Serval."
" A quietly powerful portrait of a place ruled by religion
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,7,"While its choppy, rambling narrative approach could be distracting at times, 'Timbuktu' is a quietly powerful portrait of a place ruled by religion and a people traumatised by division."
" Beautiful yet tragic
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,9,"A wonderful, haunting, sad, slow-paced stunning and memorable African movie. Thoroughly recommended!"
" Daesh in Mauritania, amazing cinematography
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,8,Excellent Mauritanian film with amazing cinematography about Daesh imposing narrow-minded authoritarian fundamentalist rule over people and families in a mulsim village named Timbuktu. Off course people are condemned for the most absurd reasons and punishments are dire.
" Some aspects are working pretty well, but overall a fairly flawed movie
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,4,"""Timbuktu"" is a Mauritanian/French co-production from 2014, so this one has its 5th anniversary this year and it was written and directed by Abderrahmane Sissako, a Mauritanian filmmaker who has been active in the movie industry since the early 1990s, so almost 30 years now. His origin is also a key reason why this is rather seen as a Mauritanian movie and not a French one. One aspect that always come sup when there is talk about this film is that it was nominated for an Oscar (and for a BAFTA) in the foreign language film category. Well, this is quite an achievement, especially if we also take into account that this was not just the first time Mauritania submitted a movie for the Academy Awards, but also the only time so far. Despite the success here, it did not submit anything else in the year afterwards. Oh well, I guess the country has other issues these days than filmmaking. Also this film is set in Mali because this is where Timbuktu is located. Had to check that I will admit. Actually I think this place was used frequently in German Disney comic books whenever they made a reference to a place that is truly far away from whcih it is like impossible to get back to ""Entenhausen"". But lets not drift away now. So with the Oscars this country is 1 out of 1 if we focus on nominations and not wins. Not too shabby. However, with me it is 0 out of 1 because I thought that overall this was not a good watch. I will try to explain to you why I think so. I think overall this film is going for the obvious. It does not feel coherent and there is hardly a plot in it. With the obvious I mean that in terms of very sinister moments that shows us how backwards society is still in Timbuktu. Still pretty shocking, but the moments of the two characters killed in the sand with only their heads looking or the scene when the women gets whipped (possibly to death) are painful to watch, but they steel need a better build-up or lets say more previous elaborations on the characters for audiences to care. Otherwise it just feels like a reenacted documentary I'd say. But this is not the key criticism I have here. That one would be that I felt the script to be really all over the place at times.Individual scenes are working, but as a whole the connections in-between are just too shoddy. And while it is a pretty severe film with the scenes I just mentioned and also the killing of the animal in the water and the chain reaction that then results in the killing of a man a little later, there are nonetheless lighter moments. One guy being clearly attracted to a woman as he always comes to visit her when her man is not there. Or also the fish washing scene with bare hands, although this one is also not only comedy like the previous one I mentioned because it gives a slight elaboration on the role of the female in countries that are dominated by fundamemtal Islam. Nonetheless, this heavy subject was one that was not as dominant as you could have guessed here. Gender discrimination is never a key component of this film. Like I said what is dominating and more memorable here are individual scenes and while we get to see how gruesome the religion of Islam can be, we also seeother approaches as there is a lot of talk about jihad, but it does look fairly clumsy sometimes too because they are not capable of doing anything in that bare hands scene I just made a reference too, but also in another scene when peaceful muslims are willing to pray and the ""holy warriors"" are obliged to leave the building or when one guy is questioned about his loyalties, he almost mocks the holy war a bit by saying he is fighting his own jihad. And finally, also I want to say something about one particular scene when we see a bunch of children play football because this scene was also mentioned in the preview of the film here in Germany and while they said it was one of the most symbolic scenes, I think it was basically in a nutshell what was wrong with this film. Sure it is correct and informative about Islam that they took away the ball from them, so they cannot really play and just reenact a football game because it gets in the way of what Allah wants that they should not have too much joy away from religion, especially when it comes to activities that are really popular in the western still Christian-dominated world. However, this scene would never happened like this in real life. Either the more god-fearing Muslims would have stopped them and not allowed them to play or they just would not have managed to do so because they are all getting along so well and accepting what everybody else does as if they knew in advance. And it's children lets keep that in mind. This scene felt more scripted and acted than pretty much everything else I saw this year and that is a very negative outcome in a crucial way because this is a film that tries to depict things the way they are to almost feel like a documentary and this is where it really fails hard. This scene I mean. Other scenes felt more realistic and authentic and I did not have the impression to watch actors perform. Some more, some less. However as the editing and the whole package here feels pretty incoherent as I explained earlier, I am not too happy about the outcome, let alone about the awards recognition. This really feels a case like honoring this film for where it is from and because it is such an uncommon production. But this apparently made them forget to look for real quality here. There are some good shots yes like the animal running at the beginning and end and also after the killing happens in the water when we see the action from far far away, so we basically only see silhouettes, but these scenes cannot make me ignore how mediocre (at best) the overall outcome here was. I give it a thumbs-down and don't recommend checking these 95 minutes out. Actually, it is even more disappointing how weak the script was at times taking into account how long Sissako has been making films already. Maybe it is not his best job choice. Watch something else instead."
" The impact of Islamic fundamentalists on the Tuarag people
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,7,"A Mauritanian-French drama; A story about a cattle herder living a peaceful life in the desert with his wife and children who accidentally crosses paths with Jihadists who control a nearby ancient Mali town. Overnight, his world is shattered, and everything he loves and values is threatened. A beautifully shot film with an insight into the effects of a radical Islamist group on a small African town. It juxtaposes the cruel acts and stranglehold on people's liberties with the spirit and poetic images of the Mali people. The characters are flatly characterised and the central plot is superfluous to the power of the defiance and human dignity in the other stories it portrays."
" Devastating
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,8,"Timbuktu - a devastating yet often beautiful film about life (and death) in Mali amongst the chaos of 'jihadi' rule and Sharia law. Shows the human side of the 'jihadists' rarely portrayed in the western press. It's also not afraid to show the barbarity and absurdity of their interpretation of Islam. Some surprisingly light and funny moments - such as the teenagers playing football without a ball with the precision of a real game (footballs are banned, as is music, singing etc.). One to be admired - try and see it if you can. 8 out of ten."
" Unexpected Gem
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,10,"I usually get recommendations from friends who love movies, and I deliberately go into the movie ""blind"" to limit my expectations one way or another. Of course, with Hollywood blockbusters or sequels, it is hard to avoid seeing or hearing something about the film.Timbuktu is an excellent film. It draws you in with the beautiful cinematography and keeps you there with the story.Set in historically famous Timbuktu, Mali; we see that the territory has been taken over by Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) as the black standard flag of the jihadist group flys.Their rule of law is strict and adheres to their own interpretation of Shariah. They declare the prohibition of smoking, music, soccer and even hanging out around the ancient town. Their punishments severe, hard lashings. For adultery, the punishment is death by stoning. Of course, much like most power structures, the rules don't apply to the jihadists. There are many contradictions. They enter the mosque wearing shoes and guns and are promptly kicked out by the imam. One of the commanders visits a woman without her husband present. The same commander smokes regularly. To make matters worse, there is miscommunication among the local population and the jihadists. The locals speak Tamasheq and some French, whereas the jihadists mostly speak Arabic with some French and English. But the communication is not only linguistically, but culturally. At one point, a young jihadist soldier comes to propose marriage to the mother of a young Mail girl. Her mother refuses, saying she does not know the man and his proposal is improper, as her husband (the father) is not at home. Almost immediately, the man threatens to take the girl by force, which he later does. Another time, a group of young men and women play music and sing together, praising Allah. The jihadists arrest them for playing music and for the men and women being together unmarried. Tensions right hot and seem as though they could give at any moment. A good example being when various men and boys are playing soccer without a ball. As soon as a patrol comes by, they start doing stretches and exercises, immediately reverting back to the match as soon as the patrol departs. The tensions between the imam and the jihadist leadership are another interesting thread in the story.Give this film a look, you won't be disappointed and it provides key insight to the challenges terrorist groups put on local communities."
" Very poor cinematography despite the award
",2018-06-08 00:00:00,2,"To me the visual of the film is extremely insipid, savorless, amazingly dull and plainly disappointing! And in that area, someone will have to explain to me how cinematographer Sofian El Fani, who once again reveals himself as an amateur, actually did get a credit for this movie.
Very rarely do we see technical challenges. The movie's visualization is so technically repetitive and mind-numbing that it makes the whole movie extremely boring (how many viewers did say they were checking their watch!). Timbuktu's stunning sandy deserts, lakes and caved houses, which should have been splendidly rendered, are regrettably reduced to being consistently filmed with the same elementary shots over and over. It could have been merely OK for a documentary (which the movie was supposed to be BTW). What makes the filming approach so tedious is that Sofian El Fani fails to convey emotions through camera angles (kind of reminded me of La vie d'Adèle where El Fani makes such an excessive use of close-ups that it becomes unbearably repetitive to the viewer).So unless there was a political move to credit Tunisian film crew members, such as El Fani, (Original Score award to Amine Bouhafa was well deserved though), there is no technical basis whatsoever for him receiving this award for best cinematography.
Globally, this film probably moved Western World viewers -- that's why it actually got credited--, but it no manner does it contribute to cinema or art."
" Beautiful cinematography but as for plot, not so much
",2018-01-25 00:00:00,2,"This film's story was, for me, a chef's salad where it should have been a whole tomato. Or a steak, perhaps. It purports to be the story of a small village into which the Taliban, or generically ""the jihadists"" move in to run the show. There are scenes of these men barking orders to the villagers about what to wear or what not to do, but the center moves to a man, his wife and their 12yo daughter living in a tent on the village outskirts, and another man who fishes with nets in a river which he seems to think is his own property. Then there are the pointless scenes of the jihadists spinning cookies in a Toyota pickup. And the crazy woman in the village. And, and....none of these events seem to bear a relationship with any other. Eventually a murder is committed which has absolutely nothing to do with the jihadists having taken control of the village, except they mete out a death sentence to the confessed murderer. There is never any suspense concerning the man's fate so this isn't really a spoiler alert, but after the jihadists gun him down they all jump in their pickups and take off, leaving the viewer with the impression they won't be back.  After watching, I read a few other reviews extolling its message and power, but to me it was an unsatisfying mish-mash of unconnected events. None of the jihadist dictums were a surprise, not adding anything to what we've known for many years about these sick thugs and their perversion of the Muslim faith. But what bothered me more than anything else was that ""Timbuktu"" was absolutely devoid of emotion."
" A tale of the Islamist take-over of Mali that reframes our perspective on 'Terror.'
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,10,"From the nebulous Al Qaeda to the rampaging mobs who call themselves Daesh, Islamist fighters are portrayed in our media as an almost metaphysical threat: barbaric, 'medieval', an enemy that defies comprehension, they are the personification of the Terror that 'we', the civilized, are told we must fight. The beautiful and troubling film 'Timbuktu', set during the Islamist take-over of Northern Mali, reframes this story.From the opening scenes, when the local Imam orders the Jihadists out of the mosque, it is clear these men have neither spiritual nor moral authority. The rules they impose on the local Muslim population are both absurd and vicious. Music, football, sitting in the street and smoking are forbidden. The women are forced to wear gloves much as the Jews of Spain were required to wear yellow stars by the Inquisition – or as Muslim women in France are forbidden from wearing the veil today. The film demonstrates how these arbitrary edicts have nothing to do with faith and are designed solely to assert social control.One of the most beautiful sequences shows the boys of the town playing soccer with an imaginary ball in an act of joyous, collective defiance. Yet, even as they ban the sport, the most animated conversation the Jihadists have is about football, and the local youths who have joined them have presumably done so for money or prestige rather than out of conviction. In a key scene where the protagonist recognises one of the local Jihadists, the man, clearly ashamed, claims to have come from Libya. These Islamic fighters, then, have more in common with gangland bullies, Nazi thugs or the youths of the Red Guard who terrorised China during the Cultural Revolution than they do with the ancient, scimitar-wielding foe of Christian imagination – a spectre from the 'crusades' that has been diligently resuscitated in both religious camps for strictly political ends.In 'Timbuktu', as in real life, it is the local Muslims – the women in particular – who suffer at the Jihadists' hands. Yet it is clear, too, that this tyranny – like all others – will be temporary. The abiding impression of these self-styled religious warriors is of a group of deeply inadequate men – men whose own impotence and longing drives them to assert illusory dominion over a natural, female and human world of irrepressible variety and beauty"
" A Necessary Film for the Turmoil in Africa Caused by Religious Extremism
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,9,"In the opening scene of ""Timbuktu"", a jeep carrying armed men is seen chasing a gazelle across the pristine dessert. This scene is followed by another scene showing militants of the so-called Islamic State shooting at intricate masks and dolls that are undoubtedly cultural icons from the region. ""Timbuktu"" is a remarkable film for a number of reasons. The timing of the film was so necessary because in the same year that the film came out a self-proclaimed caliphate swept up large swaths of territory across the Muslim world extending its cruel grip even to Africa. The beautiful scenes of the dessert around Timbuktu are accompanied by a masterfully selected soundtrack of tunes from the region. The music is relentless and melancholic, just like the dessert. Both stand as immobile presences throughout the film. In one odd scene, a group of men are arguing Messi and soccer. The audience is purposefully misled into thinking the discussion was about a serious war or series of battles. But the truth is, most boys would rather fight about soccer than something as obscure as religion. Another poetic scene happens during the film when a man is sentenced to 20 lashes for knowing that football is forbidden and still choosing to play. In the next scene, a group of young boys are all playing football, without a ball. The ball is forbidden. The boys in the colorful shirts and shorts end up running around an empty field kicking sand at each other. How can you forbid children from playing? The boys cheer an imaginary goal before they feel the need to stop and hide their activities from a motorcycle patrol. In another instance, a group of fighters are sent to find where music is coming from. When they realize the music is religious in nature and praises Allah and Muhammad they question the need to stop it. More people start to play music as a form of protest. A clearly non- silent protest that can be visibly heard by ISIS patrols in the city at night. A woman sings, ""This is my land and this is my Timbuktu. It's children are mourning and suffering. It's the land of love and warmth and dignity. So tell me, why are the children crying? Because of the injustice, violence, and fear of the future. Stop crying, my Timbuktu will always be here. Everything will go fast. You've got little time left"". Later in the film, the woman who's beautiful voice carries across the Timbuktu dessert is sentenced to 40 lashes for singing. Another 40 lashes are sentenced for meeting with men in private without her parent's permission. As she kneels and begins to be whipped she continues to sing. It is a poetic protest in response to the so-called Islamic States' cruel and unjust punishment system. An Imam questions the so-called Islamic State's cruelty towards women by scolding, ""Remember the words of Allah Almighty. Forgive them. Involve them in decisions. Talk with them. Once you have decided, I put your trust in Allah. Because he loves those who trust him. Where is the mercy? Where is the forgiveness? Where is the piety? Where is the change, the change? Where is god in all this?"".The greatest aspect of Timbuktu is the fact that the film doesn't glorify war or violence in the fashion that Hollywood so regularly chooses to. In fact the main struggle of the film is quite simple. Nearby Timbuktu, a territorial fight brews between a fisherman and a cowherd. This struggle is less of an ideological struggle and more of a struggle for survival. A boy loses track of the cowherd's youngest cow which strays into the fisherman's nets. The fisherman kills the cow and in a poignant scene the cow can be heard breathing long after it appears to be dead. The dramatic effect is undeniable. Like Africa, the injured calf will continue to fight for life long after it was left for dead. The cowherd confronts the fisherman and in the ensuing fight a gunshot abruptly interrupts the scene and both characters are seen floating in the water. One of them gets up. The other doesn't. The calm tranquility of the setting stands in contrast to the dark nature of the political situation. The so-called Islamic State confiscated all of the cowherd's cows and property for his alleged murder of the fisherman. The cowherd shows no regret or fear in response to being sentenced to death by the fake caliphate. Before accepting his fate, the cowherd asks the so-called Islamic State commander if he has children. When the commander replies in the affirmative, the cowherd makes one final plea for his daughter and the children of Africa. He says, ""What is written will be done. I am at peace with death. We are all his children. We must protect our children. My daughter will not be protected. That hurts my whole being. Down in the grave without knowing what will happen to her. Most of our relatives have already left. But in all this, since there is only one God, I worship, he will make justice. No one escapes his fate. Tell him that it's not death that scares me but not being able to look back""."
" ""Where's leniency? Where's forgiveness, where's piety, where's exchange? Where's God in all this?""
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,9,"Since hearing about it during Oscar season a few years ago, Timbuktu has been a film I've been interested to see,but unable to due to not being able to find a DVD of it. Looking to see what was about to be removed from Netflix UK,I was surprised to find the title! I got set to at last see this Oscar nom title.The plot:Entering Timbuktu,a group of ISIS fighters declare that they are taking over the land,and that everyone must follow their version of Sharia law. Driving round the villages,ISIS force the public to follow the Sharia law,from not playing with a football to no one being allowed to be in a room with a person of the other sex. As ISIS start controlling every aspect in the running of the area,local residence begin trying to speak to the fighters contradictions.View on the film:Remarkably being the first film shot in Mauritania, (standing in for Timbuktu) co-writer/(with Kessen Tall) director Abderrahmane Sissako & cinematographer Sofian El Fani draws lines in the sand with a remarkable poetic quality,from shimmering wide shots looking across the divide of the town via the river,to haunting shots of ISIS fighters standing on roofs to locate people play music illegally. Carefully using Amin Bouhafa's gentle score to give an unsettling calm, Sissako superbly follows the daily battle/grind the residences have with long takes which have a documentary grit.Partly based on the killing of a couple in Aguelhok (northern Mali) by Islamist group Ansar Dine,the screenplay by Sissako and Tall brilliantly examines every area of Timbuktu affected by ISIS's arrival with multiple threads following individuals allowing for a full picture of the horror to emerge. Following a very important current issue,the writers give the dialogue an excellent balance between an almost documentary feel and a sharp poetic quality unveiled in the residence exposing the stark contradictions of the extremists with voices of anger,and a compassionate plea for freedom."
" Fascinating; heart wrenching
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,10,"There's a lot of restraint and subtlety in director Abderrahmane Sissako's tragic delineation of what it's like to live under an ISIS takeover of a Muslim community. And there's a beautiful artistry in the way he shows the barbarism of Sharia law so horrifically played out while the subjugation of women is made clear. (Actually the women in the movie stand strong against the subjugation.) Thus the evil of the ""jihadists"" (ISIS is never named but a black flag is flown) is contrasted with the normal lives of Muslim people.Sissako, who also wrote the script, is careful to make this distinction—a distinction that a good part of the world is currently working on. It is not Muslims who are bad; it is the extremists. Yet I could not help but think as I watched this with the incessant talk of God will's, etc., that maybe, just maybe, the tribalism of religion itself is at fault. How horrible it is to live with the constant thought and expression that it is all God's doing (with a little help from the forces of evil), and that we are just pawns in some absurd game played by a nearly omnipotent power that can send you to heaven or hell based on the very behaviors built into your psyche.Well, such would apply to most other religions as well I suppose. So an indictment of Islam is not appropriate. Nonetheless the intense religious climate of the movie was for me almost tyrannical. I felt so sad for all the poor ignorant people and again was reminded of the saying ""willful ignorance is the only sin"" and again told myself that the only way out of the morass of the Middle East is education leading to enlightenment.The film is in Arabic, French and a bit of English with English subtitles. A lot of what is said is not translated into the subtitles, but little is lost in the comprehension. There are scenes of great beauty contrasted with ugly violence. Beautiful music is played and sung, and there is a soccer game played without a ball. Such is the absurdity of life under the jihadists, who are really just thugs using a distorted vision of Islam in order to justify their crimes.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Understanding Religion and Ourselves"""
" Absolute masterpiece
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,9,"A beautiful movie. Absolute masterpiece! I didn't expect it to be , but when i saw it i was charmed as much as i could ever be. I don't think i ll forget it anytime soon. It is like a dream (and a nightmare in the same time) - another world with different rules from ours, but same people. People who wants to be free, to love, to sing, to play soccer....to enjoy life. People who wants it differently.... Peaceful people who remember what was before the jihadists. This is movie which everybody must see."
