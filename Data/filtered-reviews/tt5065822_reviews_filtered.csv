",2021-01-22 00:00:00,9,"Ronaldo is my favorite player
And he is the best in football history for me
Ronaldo is the most complete player I have ever seen

" A Deep Deep movie...
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,10,"The movie 'Ronaldo' evoked many emotions throughout its running time. From happiness to downright sadness, exploring not only the different aspects of the superstars life and career but also the values and beliefs that steadily edged him into the number one spot in the world. Ronaldo himself states in the beginning parts of the movie that ""I have everything I have because of sacrifice, dedication, hard work and belief"" his pure passion and single minded approach to his career even with his addiction ridden brother and drunk of a father, emphasizing his dedication and love for his craft. The movie, however, is no attempt to present Ronaldo as a squeaky clean figure. It talks about his sons mother, and is a honest portrayal of him, whether it be his extremely competitive nature or his vanity. The viewer will leave this film with not only a greater respect for Ronaldo due to the sheer honesty in the movie, but also greatly touched by how sacrifice, dedication, hard work and belief can change any mans life."
