" ""Old Man Yelling at Clouds""
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Great watch, would watch again, and do recommend.Any movie that gets me to well up with tears is an automatic winner in my book.I always wanted to see Bill Murray play a grumpy old man, and this movie is a little more ""About a Boy"" than ""Up!"", but it's a good middle ground between the two.There is something wholesome, even when it's specifically not, about a kid being taught life lessons by someone. It's something special that I feel like I haven't see enough of, and I'd love to do myself.It's also interesting to see a coming of age story that doesn't revolve around the character coming of age and a romance. It is possible to grow up without focusing on sex, it's like a reverse Bechdel test.This is completely worth the watch, and the movie does a great job of embodying it's own message of being rough on the outside with goodness on the inside."
" So wholesome
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,8,"Great message, great movie, so good, if you haven't seen it and are looking for a good family movie, watch this one"
" Bill Murray was brilliant.
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,9,"Not a perfect movie, but close.Murray did a magnificent job. All the actors were excellent.Many smiles, several good laughs, and quite touching moments.Well written, great characters, never boring."
" Pleasant morality tale elevated by A-list cast
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,7,"Murray is at his irascible finest as Vincent, a loveable anti-hero who as the film progresses is more saint-like than you'd first realise. I wasn't expecting the film to become such a standard moral fable (""don't judge a book by its cover"" etc) and it's to the film's detriment it covers such familiar ground in such a conventional way. However the presence of such a talented cast clearly elevates St Vincent to heights the script alone could never hope to reach. The chemistry between Murray and child star Lieberher provides numerous laugh out loud moments. Watts is both endearing and highly entertaining as the Russian lady of the night. McCarthy is on strangely subtle form - which she plays truthfully - but isn't given much to do. Overall a pleasant, easy watch that thanks to a highly skilled cast just about manages to side-step schmaltzy sentimentalism."
" Acting at its finest
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,10,"This is the first movie where you can see Bill Murray as bad guy (kind of). Nothing is black and white in the movie, all the characters have their virtues and flaws, and the acting. THE ACTING! Murray is amazing here, great replicas and gestures of a grumpy old guy. You won't waste time watching this movie."
" I laughed and I cried!
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,9,"This is such a great movie. Murray's acting is flawless, he is so good and some one liners are killers! Jaeden Martell steals the scene too, it's a pleasure to see both in the screen. I kept this on the end of the queue and now I regret not to have watched it before. Go watch it!"
" When Bill Murray is doing the Bill Murray
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,7,"It took me some time to say to myself: "" Well it's another Bill Murray's movie"" and then was caught by the scenario. And enjoyed it fully actually, mostly because of that kid that does his job pretty well I found."
" People are so much more than their résume
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,7,"Yup this was good, not super memorable or all that original but well acted from a great cast and a heartwarming story. Just easily enjoyable. Follows a retired and perpetually grumpy Bill Murry living his best life; gambling, drinking, lying around in the back yard and spending quality time with a Russian prostitute. When a newly divorced Melissa McCarthy and her 12 year old son move in next door the two don't hit it off. Unexpected overtime from her nursing job leaves Melissa with no choice but to leave her son in the care of her neighbor. Strangely the two become friends.This is a quirky little movie; Bill Murry does Bill Murry to perfection, Chris O'Dowd is a teacher, Naomi Watts is fantastic as a pregnant, heavily accented Russian lady. Worth a watch."
" A nice movie about a man who is not very nice
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,7,"Our title character is a good man, but not a nice man. He doesn't like people and most people don't like him. This is much more occurent in the world than is depicted in the movies, so, kudos for exploring such a story.While not a great movie by no means, it has many things going for it. The music is great. Bill Murray is in top form. The kid is cute and acts well. Naomi Watts looks amazing for her age. It's hard to wrap your head around the fact that she's only 18 years younger than Murray and is ~45 years old at the time of filming. It looks more like she's ~30 years younger and is ~35. Even Mellisa McCarthy actually acts, rather than just goof around.But the best quality of the movie is that the jokes, which there are quite enough for a ""dramedy"", come naturally. Those are not gags or spoofs. It's just funny things that happen in life.Yes, the story is not all that great, is a little predictible, uneven and way too cheesy towards the end (""did you know he was an officer and a war hero in Vietnam? He's famous!"" really feels botched on). With a better story, this could have been a great movie.Still, as is, it's well worth a watch."
" Trope bullies, cheerful hookers and cheap sentimentality
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,5,"You know the writing is bad when Melissa McCarthy is more convincing than Naomi Watts. Despite a highly enjoyable lead performance from Bill Murray, St Vincent quickly degenerates into a schmaltzy paint-by-numbers comedy littered with the usual cliches.High school bully who actually turns out to be a misunderstood softie? Check. Sensitive, intelligent child protagonist who remains calm and measured despite the chaotic behaviour of the adults around him? Check. Friendly prostitute who happily becomes an all-in-one maid, carer and surrogate auntie? Errr check, I guess.A film that tries way too hard to pull at the heart-strings and in doing so becomes tedious and sickly. Not the worst way to spend an evening but a terrible waste of some great actors."
" love bill murray
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,8,"""I honestly don't remember.""If you happen to look at the poster for St. Vincent you might go into it expecting a full blown comedy, but you would be surprised because this film takes a much more dramatic and sentimental approach. There are several funny scenes of course because Bill Murray and Melissa McCarthy are involved, but it's also touching and emotional. There are many comparisons in tone with Jack Nicholson's As Good As it Gets because the lead character is a grumpy old jerk who the audience is forced to sympathize with. It is a very fine line that an actor has to walk through when portraying a character such as this because the performances can seem cartoonish and forced at times, but Bill Murray pulls it off in a very authentic way. His character actually feels real in this movie despite all the flaws with the script and the overly familiar plot. St. Vincent follows pretty much all the cliches in the genre where you have this grumpy man being softened by a kid in need of a father figure (think Up, Big Daddy, Bad Words, Bad Santa, among others). Even Michael Douglas starred in a similar role this year in And So It Goes. The difference however with that film is that Bill Murray was able to make his character feel believable. St. Vincent is worth the watch because you get to see one of the greatest comedic actors in a lead role, and that is something rare these days. The film may be formulaic and sentimental but Murray makes up for its flaws and turns this into an enjoyable experience. I have no idea where the Oscar buzz came from because it isn't even close to being a groundbreaking film. It is way too familiar and full of cliches, but Bill Murray gets to do what he does best and that for me is a good enough reason for recommending this film. Director and screenwriter Theodore Melfi's greatest asset is Bill Murray; without him this film wouldn't even be talked about.I know that I'm being unfair with the rest of the cast by giving Bill Murray all the credit, but there are also some very interesting performances from them as well. It was a pleasure to see Melissa McCarthy playing a hard working single mother. For the first time she didn't get a character that was screaming all the time (she is funny doing that but she was getting typecast). She gives a genuine and toned down performance and I hope she gets more roles like this. Naomi Watts played a Russian hooker (a lady of the night is how Murray's character explains it to the kid) and I actually enjoyed her performance as well. I thought she nailed the accent and had some funny scenes. Chris O'Dowd shines as the teacher of a Catholic school and Terrence Howard makes a couple of screen presences as well. The sweet kid is played by Jaeden Lieberher and he also delivers a believable performance and shares great chemistry with Murray. This is the sort of sentimental film which audiences will love, and thanks to a strong cast many critics may be won over as well despite all the flaws. In the end my major complaints are that everything is resolved a little too tightly and some of the subplots could have been explored a lot better (like Murray's relationship with his wife). It is a feel good movie which Murray sells really well despite being mean spirited throughout most of the film."
" Middling movie - but magic Murray
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,7,"On the one hand, this has a pretty run of the mill plot all told, and shares more than a little of its DNA with 2002's brilliant About a Boy.But Murray pulls this material higher than it's source - largely from him and occasionally some of the supporting cast (Naomi Watts in particular) there are some charming and funny moments this.There are also some moments after the final credits have rolled that'll perhaps also reasonate about fallen heroes as well, and what we think and feel about them. Watch it, and you'll know what I mean here.You could do a lot worse than this. Enjoy it if you do watch."
" Better late than never
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,10,"I've heard of this movie but never watched it until today, 6 years after it's release. I'm so glad I clicked on it! Great cast, great acting, great story!"
" Heartwarming and Authentic
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,8,"When you see Melissa McCarthy in a cast, you automatically think comedy. This is not a comedy. It has some great moments of humour that are real-life moments, not the perfectly-timed, witty, cringe humour we all love. It is authentic in its humour. It is a heartwarming, easy to watch film that makes you experience all the emotions the director and actors wanted you to. We all relate to the characters in some way and that makes this film quite refreshing. Portraying a young boy dealing with his parents divorce and developing a friendship with his grumpy next-door neighbour, this film deals with all the aspects to this you would expect. Themes such as loneliness, bullying, acceptance, tragedy, gratitude and the debate of religion are touched on in quite a respectful, honest way. While McCarthy is wonderful, this movie would not be as great as it is without Bill Murray's spectacular portrayal of his role. You want to dislike him but try as you might, you just can't. It really showcases his acting skills, particularly surrounding the *vague spoiler* medical issue that he endured which is quite possibly the most realistic portrayal of this particular condition I have come across on film. The ending is impressive, because there are no twists or turns or anything you don't expect, but you walk away so so glad it ended the way it did because that is exactly what you wanted for the characters. It's gloriously simple and that is part of the brilliance of this movie. 8/10, would recommend it. It is worth the watch for an interesting, feel-good film."
" Fantastic
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,10,"I laughed so hard I cried, and at other moments cried so hard I laughed!!!"
" Great comedy drama
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,8,"St. Vincent is a great comedy drama that's funny, emotional and heartwarming even though it follows a familiar narrative. Bill Murray, Jaeden Martell, Melissa McCarthy and Chris O'Dowd are all great. The soundtrack is surprisingly great. It balances humour and emotion effectively and is well paced. Theodore Melfi's direction is really good."
" Help peomoting this movie
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,10,"Despite all the high earnings movies nowadays i think the main problem for this masterpiece is bad marketing. Like Intouchables this movie needs a little help to be promoted to people.Both titles are good movies and they deserve a second chance despite the passing of time. It is a good movie despite the genre pov you're watching. Good soundtrack, good actors, good story and an emotional roller-coaster. I am asking you to promote this movie to your friends or family"
" Funny but the rating is wrong
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,7,This movie shouldn't have been given a PG-13 rating due to the amount of suggestive elements and profanity. There are sections of the film that take place around a strip club. It's good but should be R
" St. Vincent
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,7,"I saw the trailer for this film once and thought it looked like something charming, and I was attracted by the good names in the cast, so I hoped for something worthwhile, directed by Theodore Melfi (Hidden Figures). Basically, in Sheepshead Bay, Vincent MacKenna (Golden Globe nominated Bill Murray) is a retired, grumpy, alcoholic Vietnam War veteran who smokes and gambles regularly. Years ago, his wife Sandy (Donna Mitchell) developed Alzheimer's disease and no longer recognises him, he poses as a doctor when visiting her, to avoid confusion, and does her laundry. Vincent's only close friends are his cat Felix and a pregnant Russian sex worker named Daka (Naomi Watts). Vincent may be aggressive towards people, but he does have acquaintances who admire and care about him. A moving van crashes into the tree next to Vincent's house, causing a branch to break and fall, damaging Vincent's 30-year-old Chrysler LeBaron. Maggie Bronstein (Melissa McCarthy), a recently divorced radiology technician, and her 12-year-old son Oliver (introducing Jaeden Lieberher) meet Vincent, who demands payment for the damage. Maggie does her best to provide for Oliver, who is ostracized and bullied at his Catholic school, but is a knowledgeable, friendly boy, welcomed warmly by his new teacher, Irish Catholic priest Brother Geraghty (Chris O'Dowd). On his first day at his school, Oliver's phone, wallet and house keys are stolen by his classmate Robert Ocinski (Dario Barosso). Oliver goes to Vincent's house and asks if he can stay until his mother comes home from work. Vincent offers to continue babysitting for a fee of $12 an hour. Vincent picks up Oliver daily after school because Maggie often has late shifts and doing so takes the boy along with him to racetracks and bars. The mismatched pair begin to help each other mature. Vincent teaches Oliver how to defend himself, resulting in Oliver breaking Robert's nose, who later apologises, and they become friends. Vincent and Oliver win a bet with high odds on the horses, enabling Vincent to pay off some of his debts. He steals money from Oliver's bank account and gambles this money hoping for a big win. It is assumed this is to keep Sandy in her nursing home. Vincent is confronted in his home by loan sharks Zucko (Terrence Howard) and Antwan (James Andrew O'Connor) who attempt to take Sandy's jewellery. Vincent falls to the ground before they strike, and Zucko and Antwan leave him on the floor. Oliver finds him and calls for an ambulance. Vincent is hospitalised, he has had a severe stroke, and has physical therapy. Oliver, Maggie and Daka help Vincent recover and his speech is slurred for some time. Maggie's ex-husband and Oliver's adoptive father, David Bronstein (Scott Adsit), a lawyer, finds out about Vincent and uses the information on gambling, introducing Oliver to a prostitute and other offenses to get joint custody, with Maggie. She tells Vincent that he can no longer see Oliver. Vincent becomes depressed after finding out Sandy died while he was in hospital. He is given a box containing her few belongings along with her ashes. For his ""Saints Among Us"" school project, Oliver asks around the neighbourhood about Vincent's past. At the school's assembly, Oliver nominates Vincent, publicly declaring him as his saint and presenting him with a medal. Oliver's reasons come from his teacher's definition of sainthood as a person showing 'commitment and dedication' and some sacrifice. Vincent fits this because of his wife and saving two soldiers during the Vietnam war. Gambling and theft are not accepted as the best course of action to raise money for nursing home fees, but the school audience are impressed by Oliver's speech and Vincent, who has been tricked into attending the event by Daka, is applauded. Some time later, Daka gives birth to a baby girl and she, Maggie, Oliver and Robert, go to Vincent's house, to share a meal together. Also starring The Handmaid's Tale's Ann Dowd as Shirley, Sunnyside Administrator, Kimberly Quinn as Nurse Ana, Lenny Venito as Coach Mitchell, The Mask's Reg E. Cathey as Gus, Deirdre O'Connell as Linda and Ray Iannicelli as Roger. Murray is fantastic as the grumpy, hard-drinking, foul-mouthed old man living next door, McCarthy does fine as the single-mother, newcomer Lieberher is splendid as the young boy, and Watts is great support as the Russian prostitute up the duff. It is a very simple premise, a cantankerous neighbour who slowly becomes more approachable from an unlikely friendship with a youngster, most of the best laughs come from the bad language and awkward moments, but there are also the necessary sentimental moments that also work well, all together it is an enjoyable comedy-drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. Very good!"
" Want my money back.
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,2,"I hated this movie for a several reasons: Bill Murray, contrived story line, unlikable characters and the cynical belief that people would like this, because they think Bill Murray is likable enough to carry a film.The plot drags as we see this derelict old creep being befriended by an earnest child. We are supposed to think there is a glimmer of redemption and salvation in this degenerate character. Looking bloated, pock-marked, saggy, bald and flaccid, Bill Murray plays an alcoholic thief who happens to unwittingly help out this kid with his schoolyard bullies. But in reality it's child who is the real saint and munificent one for giving this creep undue credit for just being the creep he is. It's a movie that will try to endear you to a loathsome character for dubious reasons."
" Bill Murray es un 100
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,10,La película es maravillosa. Tiene belleza en todas las aristas
" Good wins over
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,8,"Very good story, not likely to happen in real life, that does hit home. I totally loved the boy, the old guy Murray, and the other cast in their respective roles. It wraps up nicely. Not super hilarious but very pleasantly amusing all along. My bemol: ending rich by lottery-like life insurance is the solution. Make the film less holy."
" Could have been far better without Melissa McCarthy
",2019-02-21 00:00:00,7,"Oy, she's so bad. It's sad to see so many good films cranked by bad casting."
" A lot of humour and heart in this agreeable little film.
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,7,"Bill Murray gets another solid role which he can make the most of: Vincent Mackenna, a Vietnam veteran and retiree who has little use for other human beings besides his pregnant stripper friend Daka (an amusing Naomi Watts). He's slovenly, he's cranky, and his instinct is to act in pure self-interest. A case in point: when his new neighbour Maggie (Melissa McCarthy, in one of her best performances to date) desperately needs someone to look after her preteen son Oliver (Jaeden Lieberher), he grudgingly accepts the responsibility IF he will be paid.Naturally, the kid and the old fart soon start to hit it off, and while there is some predictable humour as Vincent takes the impressionable boy to such places as the race track and a dive bar hangout, writer-director Theodore Melfi develops the story in interesting and unexpected ways, showing us the layers to these characters as Vincent and Oliver bring out the best in each other.Murray gets to have fun playing with his characters' eccentricities (which extend through the closing credits) while revealing his utter humanity. Ultimately, Oliver realizes that there is a compelling argument to be made for Vincents' sainthood: he may be flawed, but underneath the curmudgeonly exterior, there beats a big heart.Murray is extremely well supported by McCarthy and Watts, in addition to other familiar and reliable players like Chris O'Dowd (a hoot as a sardonic priest / teacher), Terrence Howard, Lenny Venito, Nate Corddry, Donna Mitchell, Ann Dowd, Reg E. Cathey, Deirdre O'Connell, and Ron McLarty. But make no mistake: this is Bills' show. This role of Vincent is the sort of thing he's excelled at for decades. Then-newcomer Lieberher (who went on to play young Bill in the 2017 feature film of Stephen Kings' ""It"") shows a lot of poise and talent, and he's a good match for his veteran co-star.While this viewer personally felt that the various story threads weren't resolved all that satisfactorily, ""St. Vincent"" is still an engaging character study that moves along efficiently.Seven out of 10."
" IT IS WHAT IT IS
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,10,"Vincent (Bill Murray) is a baby boomer who failed to adequately plan for his retirement. His money has ran out. Fred Thompson won't give him another dime on his reverse mortgage. He has a rough exterior as he drinks, gambles, and frequents a prostitute (Naomi Watts). Circumstance places him as a baby sitter for puny Oliver (Jaeden Lieberher) the son of soon to be single mom Maggie (Melissa McCarthy) who has her own issues.While Vinny introduces Oliver to vices, he also sees the basic compassion and humanity in the man no one would expect to have any.The film is funny and heart warming almost as if it was a Magnolia indie. Murray and McCarthy did an excellent job as did the supporting cast. Chris O'Dowd as Brother Geraghty was a hoot.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex. No nudity."
" A movie worth watching once
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,7,"Bill Murray gives an outstanding performance in St. Vincent. His character is a compelling mixture of callousness and sympathy. And Jaeden Lieberher is an impressive child actor, as well. Those two performances are what make St. Vincent a movie worth watching. It's a story that inspires you to look for the good in people, even if it's hard to find."
" I loved this movie because it shows you people can still be loved
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because it shows you that no matter how unpleasant someone is they will make an effort to improve for the right person. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. Especially by Bill Murray who steals the shows. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Sitrictly recomended
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,8,I suggest you to watch it. As a veteran the guy had bad feelings so he isolatedhimself from the world. But the kid gave him fun . also he taught the kid how to love in real world. In short the film took me in it and i really got sad at the end. You ll love it.
" Absolute heartbreaking and heartwarming in the same time
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,10,What a great story line and a movie!!!!I would give it hundred starts if I could
" Loved!
",2018-09-21 00:00:00,10,Wonderful film! Heartbreaking and hopeful. Every single character perfect.
" Chiches abound, but the cast and especially Murray are irresistible
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,7,"A sappy and cliche filled story about a crabby old man who takes care of his quiet shy latchkey neighbor kid. Both learn life lessons from one another and both become better people for it. Oh, did I mention there's also a hooker with a heart of gold and there's also a single mother doing the best she can? Before you dismiss this formula story set-up, the grouchy old neighbor is played by Bill Murray, so that alone should be enough to make you want to give ""St. Vincent"" a chance. First time writer/director Theodore Melfi does deliver a story that's corny, cliched, and predictable (one medical emergency seemed particularly unnecessary, not adding anything to either character or plot), but despite the maudlin set-up and cookie cutter character tropes, the cast is incredibly strong, led by Murray as Vincent. He takes care of young Jaeden Lieberher, teaching him how to fight dirty, how to gamble, and how to get a bartender's attention, but it's Bill Murray teaching him these life lessons! So even though we've seen this tired formula a hundreds of times before, it's hilariously fun to watch with Murray playing the child-hating curmudgeon. How can you resist Bill driving around in his 1984 Chrysler Lebaron, gabling and drinking, and consorting with his Russian prostitute/girlfriend, Naomi Watts, all while taking care of a young child. As with these sorts of films (everything from ""Little Miss Marker"" to ""Bad Santa""), Lieberher teaches Murray how to be kinder towards others and Lieberher learns how to stand up for himself. Lieberher's mom is played by Melissa McCarthy in what is surprisingly straight role, which is an inserting change of pace for the usually hilarious comedic actress and she's very good. Watts is also quite good in a primarily comedic part that could have easily slid into an annoyingly cliched character, but she elevates the material so that you genuinely care about her character. This's what the entire cast does for the film, elevating the cliches and making it worth watching. They may not be characters you'd want to actually spend time with in real-life, but they are characters you care about, are compelling to watch on-screen, and who you are rooting for. Overall, ""St. Vincent"" is not a great film, but the cast very nearly makes it such. Chris O'Dowd and Terrence Howard also appear in the film."
" Sincerely humorous with some epic instances!
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,8,"There are movies like hangover, borat and our idiot brother with characters played by Zach Galifianakis, Sacha Baron Cohen and Paul Rudd. All this movies highlight the humor to its extreme only because of the characters chosen to play these roles. Same is the case here the character St. Vincent which is also the movie name is played by Bill Murray.The essence of the movie is lifted by Bill. He is sincerely funny. All other elements added to make the movie run well with his acting. The comedy drama keeps you engaged every now and then by coming up with something new at every instance.Despite his moody behavior his new neighbor oliver who is a child pens down his character as a saint for an elocution completion held at school. Is he right? See the movie and decide for yourself."
" 6 stars if would be European movie. Good film, Semi realistic story, good actors
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,9,"I am happy to saw Bill Murray and Naoimi Watts.
All the rest are good actors also!
Story was interesting also.
Dramaturg is good also, writer, director, and the crew.
The end was a bit too american cheesy what took off my pleasure I expected sad ending and more drama.
But its good for Hollywood. If it should be European or Asian movie, Inwould give 6 stars only;) 
8 stars for Hollywood"
" Bill did it again! (but do you ever expect him not to?)
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,10,"This was a great film!

" Glacial And Improbable
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,6,Bill Murray's performance is worth the watching but the storyline is glacial and in parts improbable. Not fond of movies where the music tells you how you should be feeling (but really aren't!)
" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",2018-01-24 00:00:00,8,"Chemistry can make all the difference in a film, even when the story has been done before. St. Vincent wasn't a great film because the story was out of this world. In fact, it wasn't even all that original, but rather the fantastic chemistry between veteran Bill Murray, and newcomer Jaeden Lieberher made all the difference. After a bitter divorce, Maggie & Oliver have been forced to move to a new neighborhood, where they find their new neighbor is a bitter old drunk named Vincent (Murray). Vincent wants nothing to do with anyone, until happenstance throws him together with Oliver, who he reluctantly agrees to watch in exchange for a paycheck, but what does he know about taking care of a kid? Even though this movie could have been more raunchy, Bill Murray is always funny and paired together with this scrawny, innocent, overprotected kid, made for some of the best interplay I've seen in a very long time. Murray was at the top of his game, but he almost had the show stolen right out from under him by young Jaeden Lieberher. Four years later, we know this kid is a star, and after seeing this performance, it's easy to see how he landing huge roles in the movies It and The Book of Henry. Finally the cast is rounded out by Melissa McCarthy who I honestly can not stand anymore, but believe it or not, she was very reserved and laid back. I didn't know she was actually capable of doing that. St. Vincent won't win any awards for originality, some parts could be a bit slow, although there were a few surprises. As for me, I love the chemistry, I always enjoy seeing how young actors and actresses got their start, and the film stars Bill freaking Murray, need I say more?"
" This is the art,what we need for become true saints
",2018-01-13 00:00:00,9,"This is sad man speaks directly to my sad man. That is how I like this egregious drama, what I happened to enjoy in Saturday the 13th Jan. When the melodramatic sainthood in the world of cinema failing, there are some good reasonable uprising in movies with similar theme, and out of all those title , this shit worth your sad time. Sometimes when I sit alone and watch this kind of movies, I feel the cinema is correct but of course the real world is way far far behind from what it is call human life. You see the nursing home people wanna 'Put' Sandy somewhere else if this old man fails to pay, Stupid bankers, as always and always try to survive in their pathetic protocols and trying be nice about their imprudent schmuckness , and you will see sicken hospital policies. So, see , out of the beauty of freedom and essence of love and compassion the blunt rudeness of , I would say mostly greed created living system breaking the wonderful norm of humanity. To the most of world Daka is a hooker but to Mr Vin , she is the 'Lady of night' and this bold man showing his deep seated empathy to this lady by frankly apprenticing the honesty of the way she make living. And in return Daka play a role more than just a hooker. I will say ,that would be the true satisfaction of doing business. As an armature reviewer am quite blind to see weakness in a movie if I truly fell in love with it . so, yes and I am blind to find a flaw in here. From the script writer (may be the person we always forget to give the credit) , director and all staring doing everything sharp and flawless, and of course our Bill Murray, the man lost in translation :) reasoning his excellence in Hollywood once again as Vin.Why we need art, If it is for creating better world, then we need this kind of art, we need more human watching this kind of art. We need not to white wash ugly governance and corporation as the way of life, an it's stars as the Saints. We need people to be true to them and stand for it and to be real saint to their their very own way.Of course Mr Vin, even I don't understand why people say ' I am sorry for your loss'Loving this !!!"
" Way too sentimental, but some strong performances
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,6,"This film was way too sentimental and tried way too hard. That said, Murray and McCarthy gave amazing performances that buoyed almost every scene (and the soundtrack didn't hurt either). It was far from perfect, but it would have been an unmitigated disaster without those actors. Sometimes a simple set-up and great performances is enough to (mostly) redeem a movie."
" zzzzzzzzzzZZZZZzzzzz
",2017-09-08 00:00:00,3,"If you came for Bill Murray, you won't be too disappointed. If you came for anything else, keep walking. This is phony, feel-good, message-at-the-end, holiday season trite. It's Hollywood's interpretation of ""the struggle"" of the average suburban kid moving to the big city. How many times have we seen that? When Bill Murray is on screen, it felt like Bad Santa with none of the filthy language and disgusting antics. Without Murray, it's a Lifetime network cut of a lost Judd Apatow movie. Chris O'Dowd even plays a Irish-Catholic school teacher... uh, typecasting much? A half hour was all I needed. It wasn't going to get any better."
" Bill Got Himself an Accent
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,8,"Bill got himself an accent.Murray was born to play a cantankerous old man.I'd walk through the line also. It's a releasing feeling when no ones in line.""Long life"" is a nice line, particularly delivered by a kid.I've seen that hippie on my bus in Portland.O'Dowd kills it again. He makes me want to attend Catholic school.That's good. Tire 'me out so they keep quiet.""The Big MT"" :) Mowing dirt. Nice.That's right. $h1#b@g bully.A hint of Juno."
" Uncomplicated and easy to sink into
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,8,"This film works for me because my believability meter never needed to be consulted throughout. It is a rare film these days that doesn't rely on CGI and triple back-flip plot twists to get them over the line. It is simple, honest story-telling at its best.This is a story about a VINCENT, a old man who has run out of options. So deep in denial, he blindly carries on with a slow suicide while ignoring the way his life is crumbling around him. He is completely broke, he can no longer afford to pay for the expensive care facility his wife resides at (she has dementia and doesn't even know who he is anymore), he owes a large gambling debt to a hoodlum, he drinks and smokes heavily and generally hates most of the world.His redeeming qualities are few and the film does not try to recreate him into the SAINT (from the title), which I really appreciated. This is not a Disney movie though I found the speech by Oliver a little bit too much. Something got in my eye about here.Vincent is forced to grabs the last lifeline left to him when his neighbours kid, Oliver, needs a sitter. Vincent uses the circumstances to extort money from the mother, Maggie, but as time passes he gets to know, and like, the kid. We can chose to see this as Vincent's true nature coming out, but enough of the old, bitter Vincent is still there to make for some very funny scenes.Perhaps there's not a great deal of substance in this film but I liked the way it was presented. No one had to be totally evil or totally good. It was about real people and real reactions. In this day and age of extremes, it actually felt fresh. All the wrongs weren't corrected or even apologised for. The ending lets us know that just having a life with even a tiny bit of meaning can be enough to make us happy."
" Bill Murray with real emotions
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,9,"This was a very touching movie with a 'cute' 'funny' 'realistic' story, had me laughing and crying. I love Bill Murray and the boy, but I am sick of Melissa McCarthy. Honestly the only thing that stood in the way of the last star was her... if they cast someone, almost anyone else, it would have been a solid 10. Also, why does IMDb put a 'minimum length' requirement on movie reviews..."
" Touching, Understated
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,9,"I really enjoyed this film.Bill Murray gives a typically great performance in it as the titular ""Saint"" Vincent. The name is ironic in that he is actually very much a jerk. He's selfish, slovenly, arrogant, rude, and just all around ill- tempered with nothing but faults.But when a single mother with problems moves in next door (running over his fence in the process) as much as he pushes them away he ends up connecting with the kid, first because he really needs the babysitting money the mom will pay him, but he soon comes to like the kid despite himself.It's the kid who really comes to care about him though. And no matter how much Vincent pushes him away the kid sees something good in him which nobody else, Vincent included, can see - or remember."
" Even better than I thought it would be.
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,7,"Simply put, it was a great film. The acting was incredible. I personally think that anyone who can do comedy well, is fantastic in drama. Comedy is much harder to tap into and act out than drama, in my opinion. So being that two of the main cast are known as comedians, is a good sign. The film 360 degrees was great. It was more than expected and more real than I would have though. Melissa McCarthy did very well as did the rest of the cast. Bill Murry was different than any other film I've seen him in but he kept it very real and emotional. Naomi Watts, unsurprisingly did amazing. Is that such a surprise though? Her character was a loud, bold, straight-forward hooker who definitely was needed. Without her the film would have been so much different. As well as the acting in the film, the story was great and very well written. It has more context than I thought it would have and it went places I didn't predict which was all the more better. I would watch this film again 100 percent. The acting by itself holds up the film but it doesn't need to as it delivers on every other aspect. It was a very fun yet emotional film. Definitely give it a watch!"
" Well done both with the comedy and drama
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,7,"St. Vincent is a great movie. It's funny comedy but also has a surprising emotional depth. I've always liked Bill Murray and also here. To be fair he plays the same character he usually does, but he does it so well. He's the bitter sarcastic jerk but who deep down is a good person. St. Vincent has many funny moments and dare I say all of them come from Murray, close to all. But this movie I would describe as kind of a dark comedy or maybe even little tragic comedy. Because the drama is actually most gripping. There is much more depth in the story than I was expecting. In the end the movie is of the feel good genre and so there are some cheesy moments. But it's not a problem as the movie is still not too predictable or overly sentimental. Newcomer Jaeden Lieberher does great. The character we the viewer should feel most sympathy for and one does. Usually I'm not a huge fan of Melissa McCarthy but here she fits her character perfect. Nothing of her slapstick overacting which is what I associate her with. Mostly her character is serious and sad in a emotional way. Her funny moments come when she's playing of Bill Murray's grumpy old man with her own sarcasm. Of the main characters its Naomi Watts who brings the shortest straw. Her performance is alright even if I can't stop noticing the accent. It's just that her character is the least interesting and also feels like the least important. St. Vincent is a very good heartwarming movie. It has humour, a well written story, good actors and characters."
