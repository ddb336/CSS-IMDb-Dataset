" This was an action packed movie for the heart
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,10,"I watched this movie because I had nothing else, but was surprised at how good it was. There were heart churning parts but also heartwarming ones. I loved this movie and would 100% recommend it to anyone, as it fits into quite a few genres."
" Does enough relatively well and covers many bases
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,7,"3 days to kill is a somewhat dumb movie for a number of reasons but is still highly entertaining with a number of bright spots to enjoy.The premise is that of an aging secret agent who whilst still clearly at the exceptional at his job is looking to call it a day. However he is dragged back into the business in exchange for potentially life extending experimental drugs to cure an illness, which is attractive to him so that he can attempt to spend time with his estranged daughter.The casting of the movie is really good, Kevin Costner as the protagonist and Haliee Steinfeld as his daughter do excellent work here. Costner undertakes the action scenes exceptionally well portraying a formidable assassin who is not only weary but sick. The relationship or lack of between father and daughter provides some of the highlights throughout the movie with well created chemistry.Whilst Amber Herd is a great casting choice I struggled with the character itself, both visually and the character's motive, none of which was explained at any point and seemed alien completely to the movie.It's written by Luc Besson and the screenplay and story are filled with trademarks of Besson's style however generally it's all been done better elsewhere by himself. Scattered throughout we have scenes that are more fitting in some kind of light heart comedy and whilst they most land ok, seem slightly out of place with the movie and the Costner casting.Overall it is lacking, but it is one of those movies that does enough relatively well and covers many bases. Good casting, decent performances, interesting locations (Paris), nice action and is well paced. And it is this overall feeling you are left with, even if it is somewhat forgettable. I gave this a 7 but for me its more like 6.7 i.e not enough to get a 6."
" Amber heard a Poo poo
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,10,..Amber heard is a Poo Poo face innit.
" ""3 Days to Kill"" - I enjoyed this!
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,8,"From IMDB: A dying CIA agent trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter is offered an experimental drug that could save his life in exchange for one last assignment.
Director: McG. Writers: Adi Hasak (screenplay), Luc Besson (screenplay)
Stars: Kevin Costner, Hailee Steinfeld, Connie Nielsen, Amber Heard.From EuropaCorp, Luc Besson's French production company, featuring
Kevin Costner, a worn down CIA Agent (with a ""particular set of skills"") , his estranged wife and teenage daughter, that he hasn't seen in ten years.If the above seems reminiscent of Liam Neesom and Taken, that's because
Luc Besson was behind both. Here Costner has to do one last job in exchange
for the CIA's medical assistance. Candidly? I believe all four 'Stars' were excellent
in their roles.Costner had some great 'skills' and both his gunplay and hand-to-hand were of the same caliber as Neesom's. There were some funny and tender moments here too, involving a family of squatters, as well as 'bad guys' that Costner takes care of in his usual fashion.As stated, I liked this a lot and it's well worth your time. I give it 8/10."
" ""The question is..., kill, or die?""
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,7,"Here's another film with a double entendre'd name I've seen recently. The other one was ""Killerman"" in which the title character was named Killerman, and he happened to kill people. With ""3 Days to Kill"", you've got a CIA assassin on the way out with time on his hands in Paris as he attempts to reconnect with his estranged wife and daughter, hence, he's got some time to kill. During that span though, he's also taken on an assignment that might offer him with a life saving experimental drug, thereby giving him about that much time to track down and kill both The Wolf (Richard Sammel) and his dirty bomb bag-man, The Albino (Tómas Lemarquis). What I liked about the picture were all the cleverly scripted scenes that led to humorous exchanges, like Ethan Renner's (Kevin Costner) argument with handler Vivi Delay (Amber Heard) over who the mustache guy should have been, and the kidnapped driver Mitat (Marc Andréoni) offering Renner fatherly advice from the trunk of his car. There was also the subtle placement of Renner's weapon on the roof of a car as a handful of thugs thought about working him over, and Guido's (Bruno Ricci) recipe for pasta sauce for Zooey Renner (Hailee Steinfeld) while under duress. Virtually all of those scenes defied credibility in the day to day life of a hired assassin, but what the heck, it made for some distractions in the story. All of this comes by way of Luc Besson's screenplay, no stranger to assassin flicks as the writer and director of one of the best in the genre, ""Léon: The Professional"". The story line loses a little focus as it winds down, as Vivi made it clear early on that she wanted to kill The Wolf, leaving The Albino up to Ethan, but when push came to shove, she tried to make him do it. Under the dizzying influence of his latest experimental injection, Renner taps out and Vivi has to make the save after all, which didn't prove to be too much of a bother. Back on the home front, Ethan manages to make nice with his wife (Connie Nielsen) and daughter, but we never do get to find out if he's got more than a couple months left to live. The closing scene offers a teaser."
" A Feel Good Action Flick
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,9,"3-Days to Kill is a mix of comedy, action, and Drama that left me feeling good. The film follows Ethan Renner (Kevin Costner), a former CIA agent who is dying. Realizing that he has spent his whole life working, Ethan sets out to make amends with his wife (ex-wife?) and his teenage daughter. However, things get crazy when Amber Heard shows up and offers Ethan a miracle drug in exchange for hunting down a man for her. While the plot may not sound that exciting, what really sold this film was its performance. Kevin Costner did an amazing job of playing a tired old dad who just wants a relationship with his daughter. Hailee Steinfeld's performance is simply amazing, and she steals every scene she was in. I also loved Marc Andréoni's character. I'm not a fan of Amber Heard, but she did okay in this in comparison to some of her other films (except Aquaman). The one flaw with this movie was the villains were a little one dimensional and their motivations. The ending also left me with mixed feelings. But overall I would say that this is a feel-good movie about finding what is really important to you."
" Fun action thriller
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,7,3 Days to Kill is a McG directed CIA based spy movie staring Kevin Costner who has a terminal illness and he doesn't have long to live. During his last few days he reconnects with his wife Connie Nielsen and daughter Hailee Steinfeld. This was a decent action thriller with some comedic script even though Costner acts as a bad guy. Amber Heard plays Kevin's CIA contact who is ordered to kill some German operatives that we have no clue what they did wrong. This movie was part family drama and part spy action movie that was good to watch.
" A Few Hits, a Few Laughs, A Glass of Wine Down Your Pants
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,8,"The cast, writing and direction were aimed at entertainment and succeeded for me. Mr. Costner has the growly voice working full time and has mellowed with age. I liked his interactions with Hailee Steinfeld in particular. Director McG seems to have the shifting tone of the film under control and managed to get laughs with material that in places was deadly serious. Yes, there is significant body count going on.Overall it wasn't a bad was to spend a couple of hours. I even turned my wife onto it and she agreed. While they left room for a sequel, I don't expect to see it as we are nearly into 2021 and no sign of ""A Few More Days to Kill."""
" CIA operatives kill with impunity, they even shoot doormen to get into clubs.
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,5,"An unlikely plot, definitely missing some continuity as Kevin Costner's Murders and tortures his wat through Paris, breaks into people's homes and casually saves the world whilst apparently suffering from stage 4 brain cancer. It's good to know that it doesn't impact on his ability to fight. Apropos of not much one day he's attacked with a shotgun in a super market and kills his assailant which doesn't stop him getting home in time for dinner. He's making up with his ex and daughter and therefore anything is permissible. This movie was put together with the care and attention to detail that allowed a sky diving instructor to forget to put his parachute on before jumping out of the place. We sleepwalk towards the inevitable conclusion basking in the warmth of a director who has lost the plot..."
" Bad in so many ways...
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,2,"Reminded us of why we don't watch many action films or read many action books. They're so stupid and even more stupid when they're trying to make violence funny.Vivi was an enigma that should have done the job quietly and quickly by herself.There is nothing heroic about people who kill and maim indiscriminately. It's idiocy over ingenuity. No sense of care for humanity. Extremely unattractive.Most of the characters were unlikable and laughable, especially the main three. Ethan wasn't even very smart.The song choice for the father/daughter dance was downright CREEPY.Going with crude rather than classic vocabulary added to the 'ew' factor.It had some clever ideas, but films like these make us grateful for fast-forwarding and even more grateful for shows that put care and cleverness ahead of foolish tantrums and violence."
" Nope
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,1,I'm sorry I believe this actress has issues she should get help and a different profession I will not watch her movies.
" Loved this movie
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,9,"The fact that I have loved Kevin Costner since I saw him in Field of Dreams may have something to do with the 9/10 that I give this movie BUT all the other actors were great, especially his daughter.
I love action: it has action aplenty
I love humor: it made me laugh out loud a few times
I love the use of inanimate objects: it has a few of those
I love when a movie does not take itself too seriously: does that
I found this movie an entertaining way to fill a Sunday evening."
" Would be a 8 or 9 if the plot was complete
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,7,"This movie is worth watching, but they give next to no background info on the antagonists! Who is ""the Albino""? Who is ""the Wolf""?? What are their motives?And who exactly is the CIA chick, and why does she do next to nothing the whole film?They spend a good amount of time on developing the family part of the plot and deliver some quality heartfelt moments. For that, I'm giving this movie a 7 instead of a 6. Yet they essentially ignore the crime part and the bad guys."
" Farcical dramatic action movie
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,7,My face changed from 😯 to 🤣 throughout entire movie. Wish the script could be more in smart way to shoot comic perspectives. But I think Actor Kevin managed the character well by his natural professional instinct.
" Terrible Film
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,3,Now THAT is an awful waste of time and money. So much talent wasted to a comedy/action flick. Looks like they all did it for a paycheck. It couldn't be because they believed in the film and wanted to do a credible job with it. Don't bother.
" Another Kevin Costner - A Little Sappy But Overall It's An Excellent Movie For Us
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,9,"12/01/2020 I can't believe that I've never reviewed this movie before considering that I'm now watching it for my third? or fourth? time. Kevin Costner never fails to deliver as compared to many of the big name actors that are overpaid for their mediocre performances. Always on point, Kevin delivers with excess for our movie watching enjoyment. In short, he's an excellent actor regardless of the character he's given to play. Every other actor in this production are simply supporting actor/actresses for Kevin Costner. Great movie all-over-again. Loved it! Watch for yourself and decide? Bon Appetit'"
" Like usual,exellent action film from Luc Besson!
",2020-11-26 00:00:00,7,"Acting is fine,drama and action coexist nicely together,everything works in this film!"
" Nice action-thriller!
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,7,"Great story, a handful of action, tense to the very end. The film met all my expectations!"
" Spy drama with family conflict.
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,7,"It is spy story with heavy dose of family drama. Action and thrilling moments are lesser and family drama of Father, daughter and wife is taking a large part of the movie. Starting and ending porting both are action and related spy and enemies. Whereas middle part purely on family connection. However movie is watchable. Good acting by Kavin Costner along with Ambar Herd. Herd is here in stylish CIA handler means sexy superior of CIA. Some comical part of Muslim character makes you laugh definitely. Hailee Steinfeld does also good acting in role of daughter of spy."
" Wow...bad
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,1,"The acting by amber heard is awful, a child could act better then her"
" meh
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,6,"I'll make it short. I feel like this film has many unnecessary scenes which made it long. Action was great, though. The acting was decent, plot was just OK. The ending was just a very normal ending. Don't really recommend it as there's better action thrillers than this.Also, I can't stop thinking about Liam Neeson when watching. This is kind of a film Liam Neeson would star. Kevin Costner is just so like Liam.Grade: C"
" Ugh
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,1,The movie is such a spoilsport.. Movie just makes no sense.. I started watching it because of 6 rating.. :(
" ANYTHING BY LUC BESSON IS......
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,2,".....GARBAGE!!What a waste of time. There are so many levels of crap in this movie I really cannot be bothered to dissect it.
Suffice to say don't bother with this mess.You're welcome."
" Godard was bloody right, mayte! 'Girl & a Gun' is all this body needs!
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,8,"Godard was bloody right, mayte! 'Girl & a Gun' is all this body needs! ''3 Days to Kill' is slick, EuropaCorp action with still-handsome film icon, Kevin Costner, playing a once crackerjack, now terminally ill Black Ops agent, unwillingly coerced into one final, blood-soaked mission by prototypical femme fatal, Amber Heard; who, admittedly, puts her eerily glacial, uber-blonde, 'thousand yard stare' personality to wicked good use as his luridly libidinous C.I.A handler. So far, so Vanilla, BUT, it's an undeniably fun, fast-paced hayride, and a splendidly grizzled, wonderfully laconic, Kevin Costner, unleashes much of his considerable celluloid-friendly charisma into the character of errant, gun-toting, bad guy-dropping father, desperate to finally make good with his estranged daughter. I have long been a real sucker for stupidly-explosive, 'shoot first, make little sense later', Euro-Spy-action, B-Movie nonsense, and, for me at least, this is truly magnificent, 'put the brain on ice' nonsense of the highest water! (All that being said, if you actively despise all things Luc Besson, then, to be absolutely fair, this undeniably formulaic, 'greatly imperiled family man', shoot-em-up will most certainly not change your mind; but, what the hey!!!! I'm a simple 'girl and a gun' guy, and I can dig it most righteously, dude!"
" How is it possible...
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,1,"...to make a so stupid movie?
A poor attempt to put some irony leads to something soooooo ridiculous. The worst sci-fi B-movie is more realistic than this movie. Pathetic is the right adjective to describe it. Unrealistic as action movie. Unrealistic as family movie. the poorest movie i've ever seen... it made me sad for its poorness. I don't know if it is worst to waste time watching the movie of writing something more about it."
" Ethan: The longer I was gone, it felt like the harder it was to come back.
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,4,"3 Days to Kill is a film you've seen a hundred times before, unengrossing and unmemorable.Lead characters with little depth, secondary characters with none. The kind of humour of talking to a daughter over the phone about sauce or whatever, while torturing someone for information. In saying that, it's not a bad film. It's just a bit all over the place and generic, without being strong in any area."
" Movie is good, but the dubbing sucks!
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,7,"I am a fan of Luc Besson movies, with three on my all time top 10 list, that being; The Big Blue, The Fifth Element, and Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. I found this movie quite entertaining with a good amount of dry humor. I am rating it seven stars, but it would have been eight had it not been for the absolutely horrible dubbing, which many time totally fails to mimic the environment and location the actors were in, in the original shooting. Decent action and dry humor."
" I Accidentally Like This Movie
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,8,"The whole movie is entertaining and endearing.Every character seems to have depth.This movie auto-played, and I could not stop watching.It is cheesy, but I appreciate it."
" typical Besson-story under typical McG direction
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,7,"Too fast cuts and an entertaining story. That still makes a fast, not boring, movie for a 'what shall we watch?'-evening."
" good action by luc besson
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,7,"Amber Heard's baby girl (I could say Aquaman but now she is better known for being the one who hit Johnny Deep) is given the mission of eliminating the baton ""The Wolf"" (Richard Sammel of The Strain), so in one Extremely weird story turn ""Outsources"" Kevin Costner, a veteran secret agent who is dying of a raging tumor and she miraculously has an experimental serum that can save him.
Forced on one last mission in hopes of retiring to live with his teenage daughter (Hailee Steinfeld from Bumblebee) whom he barely knows and his ex the ever-beautiful Connie Nielsen from Gladiator, he will walk the streets of Paris with a shot but also with good heart.
Good action with touches of humor, directed by McG, the same of the first two of Charlie's Angels and The Babysitter and screenplay by the French genius Luc Besson, there is time even for a small tribute to The Bodyguard, meet and entertain."
" 3 days to watch...
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,5,"Kevin Costner is ""Ethan"", a retired CIA agent who learns that he has a terminal illness. Faced with this rather stark reality, he sets off to Paris to find his estranged wife and daughter to try to reconcile. Once in France, he is approached by a woman who offers him the chance of a curative, if he will help her find an elusive criminal ""The Wolf"" and so off we go on a sort of melodramatic, save the daughter, save the world, catch the crook escapade. Costner is no Bruce Willis; he engenders little sympathy and the daughter ""Zooey"" (Hailee Steinfeld) is terrible as an actress and as a character. The set piece action is well set in Paris, showing off this beautiful city to full effect, but the plot is far too formulaic with way too many lingering shots of off a contemplative ""Ethan"" and in the end I really did hope that the baddie, aided by his quite spooky accomplice Tómas Lemarquis (""The Albino"") would win the day."
" Absentee Dad Emerges as Presently Bad*ss
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,8,"For a good bit of this movie I wondered if it was a spoof on spy thrillers. Let's face it, when did 007 ever moan about not being home with the wife and kid? To top it off, absentee dad, trying hard to retire, finds out he is actually about to retire forever when suddenly a CIA agent all bimbo-ed up offers an elixer to extend his life, at least long enough to set up a trust fund for the ""acting out"" child. So he has to kill a few folks in exchange for extra bucks and extra life, no big. Worse bargains with the devil have been struck.And I have to say that as shoot-em-ups go, this one is great. And great again. Sneaky shots, bodies falling, elevator shafts, not making it to the dropped weapon, PHEW! It was terrific. Costner is totally attractive in a dying man kind of way.Just the right thing to take the mind off the national descent into street chaos. Highly recommend for a hot July night in, with plenty of popcorn and air conditioning."
" Good but could have been much better
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,7,It seemed in limbo between being a comedy action and a serious action. For me the comedy section was hit and miss and it excelled when it was more serious and the action as a whole was very good. Unfortunately Amber Heard's character optimised this and her whacky appearance seemed out of sync with the rest of the film and the comedy didn't particular work and just felt more strange than anything else. Overall though an easy and enjoyable watch.
" Action with some emotional touch
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,10,"3 days to kill is a movie with action drama and family emotions. This film isn't all about the killing and action it is also shows us the relationship between a father and daughter.
I saw many bad reviews and hate about this movie ... But I just loved every minute of it specially the conversations between hailey and kevin.If you didn't watch yet then go for it you'll love this movie."
" So bad it's almost funny
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,1,"Costner is Ethan, a terminally ill, ex-CIA agent who must embark in a ""last mission"" - one of the most overused cliches of action movies.Before his permanent departure he wants to reconnect with his estranged daughter Zooey and while in Paris, bonding with the girl, he's contacted by Vivi (a terrible Amber Heard), who's in charge of the famous ""last mission"".What follows is Besson desperately trying to be Tarantinoesque (see the snappy - but not funny - dialogues; the annoying bit with the bicycle, etc...) and failing miserably.Costener is too healthy to be believable as being on the fast way out and Heard is grotesque. Her Vivi wears a ton of make-up, peroxide wigs and tight clothes. She did not get the memo about spies's need to be inconspicuous in the real world.It doesn't help that Zooey is the usual whiny, spoiled brat and that a lot of the plot is dad trying to solve her teenage ""problems"" (yawn).For unknown reasons, part of the audience seems to believe Besson is a reputable filmaker and McG an equally dependable director (forgetting he directed pathetic tripe, such as ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""This means war"").The result is a weird, at times involuntarily funny, mix of a failed spy story with family bonding."
" Completely worth watching
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,6,The cast is really good. The story is not ground breaking but good as well.So go watch it!
" Really A Chick Flick
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,5,"There were some in edible unbelievable parts to this movie and it really is a chick flick with some action thrown in. I give it a 5 just because it wasn't terrible. But it's not good either. If you're perusing your guise and this is on snd your fingers are tired of scrolling, it's worth a stop."
" Silly yet entertaining
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,3,"A great cast with a brilliant performance by Costner, beautiful French locations, and a couple of decent action/chase scenes.While this film is entertaining and looks great, it's ultimately let down by a silly and childish plot that will appeal only to teenagers.While this film looks the part, it's core is very weak."
" Really entertaining.
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,10,"Fast moving action movie about an aging and sickly CIA operative on his final mission in Paris while retrying to rekindle his relationship with his estranged daughter and ex wife. His sexy CIA handler has the keys to his cure. Good story, lots of quirky humor and unique characters. Loads of very funny scenes to temper the violence. Worth the time. Costner riding a purple lady's bike no hands in downtown Paris is priceless!"
" Great entertainment - throw away plot
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this film. Just suspend reality, don't expect a cohesive plot and instead enjoy decent acting, great action and cool Paris backgrounds. Great movie to just relax to. No complicated plot. There are some good laughs in it also"
" An entertaining good time!
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,7,"Taken meets Leon meets Bourne. Had I seen this all before? Yes, pretty much - but this was a lot of fun!I had virtually zero expectations with 3 Days to Kill. In fact, I only intended to watch 15 minutes, but soon found myself hooked due to the action-packed opening. It maintains this fast pace throughout.The humour wasn't something I was expecting. This was hilarious! The comedy aspect alone should've been enough to reinforce to viewers not to take things too seriously here. Once you let go and surrender to the fun and insanity of it all, it's quite the entertaining good time.There's a lot going on in 3 Days to Kill. So much so, that the action and CIA-based story is almost a sideline to everything else. Combining divorce drama, with father-daughter story, terminal illness, birth and death, the plight of refugees. It's quite the mess but it was never stagnant. In some ways, it was reminisce of the big action blockbusters of the 90s.Kevin Costner was solid and seemed to be having fun. The Albino was a good evil villain. The french locations were beautiful to look at.The highlight? An Italian pasta sauce recipe stolen from Guido and his Mama at gunpoint."
" 3 Days To Kill slaughtered my one brain for two whole generic hours.
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,3,"Did anyone order a McG sandwich? No? No one? Can we then remove this uninspired item from the menu? It genuinely baffles me how a man brimming with unfavourable mediocrity still manages to helm features. His track record is less than stellar. It can't even be classed as good. And now he finds himself in Besson's EuropaCorp to exercise his amateurism by leading yet another forgettable action thriller exported from the production company that is unsurprisingly lacking in both areas. They pump out the same structure in every film. 'Taken', 'The Transporter', 'From Paris With Love'...the list is endless. A middle-aged white American male wreaks havoc in France in an attempt to stop a one-dimensional villain from succeeding in whatever their goal is. Terrorism I guess? Except this time the protagonist only has a finite amount of time left to live, so is tasked wit killing ""The Wolf"" in exchange for experimental drugs that prolong his life. But, there's a catch. If his heart rate exceeds a specific BPM, he'll experience hallucinogenic effects.So, essentially, the inverse to Statham's 'Crank', a successful action flick that Besson clearly took inspiration from when writing this screenplay. What started off as a promising gritty story on urban terrorism and arms dealing, quickly descended into a cheese-fest of comic proportions. Ethan, played by Costner on auto-pilot mode, must balance his new ""job"" with caring for his estranged daughter. Fatherhood seemed to have swept passed Ethan, as he had absolutely no clue when handling any situation the pubescent teen throws at his face. For example, her hair somehow went frantically wild when preparing for her night out. His answer? ""Splash some water on it"".The obvious awkwardness between the two was supposed to act as comic relief in between the action sequences, yet there was minimal action. A two minute car chase between a Peugeot 306 and an Audi A-something (it's a fast car, I don't care) does not substantiate thirty minutes worth of uncharismatic dialogue. Ethan obtains parental advice from a guy he kidnaps. Not once. Not twice. Multiple times. Besson's repetitive structure for comedy was exhausting, especially considering the two hour runtime. Heard was all looks and no substance. Nielsen provided some decent chemistry with Costner, but that's about it. Steinfeld was forgettable. And why the hell was this set in France? Again? There was no real purpose for the location, other than Besson adoring his country. EuropaCorp really need to explore the world.3 Days To Kill exploits the worst tendencies of its producers. Unfocused, tedious and instantly forgettable. A weird unbalanced combination of comedy and action elevate an already generic flick into the realms of mediocrity. If only I had three days to kill this snooze-fest..."
" What a joke!
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,2,"They didn't understand anything about France. That's such a shame. As often in US movies, Paris is described as a dangerous place plenty of bad people with malicious intention especially towards North American so-precious-kids but in the meantime they make it up enough to be acceptable for their public: music is fake, behaviors are fake, situations are fake, everything is seen from their ethnocentric point of view... and they got it all wrong => at the end of the day, they lose their credibility. This is a total disaster and a quite poor experience for the viewers. From a French point of view, it's very upsetting. Thankfully there are directors in this industry who have taken the time to understand what France really is before allowing themselves to use it in their movies."
" After reading the good and bad reviews...
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,7,"After reading the good, bad and indifferent reviews and watching action/drama movies, I found this to not be as terrible as some said. In fact, it was pretty enjoyable. I've seen the Oscar-worthy and the ""blow heads and limbs off with no plot at all-movies"" and this one didn't disappoint. There was pretty decent acting and some of lines were really good, especially the comedic ones. We enjoyed the ride. Made for a relaxed evening."
" Gotta love it
",2019-09-30 00:00:00,8,"Fab mix of story, humour and action ... Luc Besson knows how to Pace a film."
" Not 'Action, Drama, Thriller'

" Luc Besson should give up!
",2019-09-24 00:00:00,1,"Good screenwriters can't find work - can't get hired, but people like Luc Besson continue to make  films. What a bad up business. This movie was neither funny nor interesting."
" Not so good movie.
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,6,I didn't enjoy the time by watching this movie. I recommend to watch something else than this story:
" Has shades of Taken, but still works big time as a high-octane action movie.
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,10,"Written by one of my favorite action writers Luc Besson, 3 Days to Kill indeed has some shades of his action classic Taken starring Liam Neeson. It's just that this one is lighter in terms of tone and has more father-daughter moments. It's a high-octane action movie that's simple and pure at heart, and can be enjoyed by anyone who likes feel-good action movies.Kevin Costner's performance was nothing short of brilliance. His vulnerability throughout the duration was truly believable. Hailee Steinfeld as his daughter also delivered a strong performance. Amber Heard was impressive in her role.The action sequences are truly a visual delight. Like every Luc Besson actioner, there's a buildup to most of the action sequences and they don't happen without a reason. The car chases and fight sequences are brilliantly done, and the visuals across Paris are beautifully filmed. There's also some interesting humor thrown in at various occasions, that works big time.Besson has always excelled at writing action movies where he focuses both on the action and the protagonists who are either fathers-daughters or like them. Directed by McG, 3 Days to Kill is pure fun, and recommended to anyone seeking action-packed entertainment."
" Amber spoiled it
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,8,"Movie was quite good and entertaining.
Heather A was really unconvincing in her role and bad acting as well."
" Bad: 3.5
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,3,"Luc Besson, the famous French action aficionado (and writer of 3 Days to Kill), has never been known for making his films especially deep. This is, after all, the guy who made The Transporter, Lockout, and last year's The Family. He's good at action, not so much at dialogue or storytelling. The same holds true here. 3 Days to Kill tries to be several different things at once: a family drama, a love story, and a spy thriller all in one. But these many facets fail to come together into something good. It's made fairly well, and the acting is serviceable all around. But the plot is so cliched that it quickly becomes a bore, to a degree that the family-relationship sections come off as more eye-rolling than they should. And really, there's not much else to say. It's a somewhat competent film built on the foundations of hundreds that have come before. And if you don't mind watching a few of those again, give 3 Days a try. But if you do, I don't blame you."
" It does the Job
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,6,"If you like action and Kevin Costner, you will enjoy the movie. The plot is ridiculous in many ways, but somehow Kevin makes it work. I personally enjoyed watching him, liked his character. Pretty much as the movie goes on, thanks to Mr Costner, the the plot kinda grows on you. I found the acting on Amber Heard side super forced and no matter what you don't believe in that character. The function of the character adds to the story but acting by Miss Amber has no value and ring nothing to the character itself. Her acting is so bad, cliche, they could get any no name person there and would do this much. I personally thought they should have given the part to a complete new comer. At least a new comer would try just to impress or make a mark. Honestly the reason I thought I should write a review to warn people on this aspect of the movie. Otherwise it is entertaining. Other characters apart from this one even villains bring good action, fun, emotion to the movie. It basically delivers what it is supposed to do. Nothing more nothing less..."
" Fun, quirky and different
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,7,This movie was surprising. It was actually quite funny. I laughed out loud a few times. It had some cool fight scenes. Kevin Costner was awesome as usual. I really liked his character and the quirky humour. Don't take it too seriously. Give it a go. You might be pleasantly surprised.
" Yes!
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,9,It wasn't the last time I saw this movie! Loved it!!!
" funny I enjoyed it
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,8,"I actually quite liked this one. It wasn't run of the mill: the action was mostly believable with some really crunchy stuff, and the interposition of the family life with the CIA stuff was really funny at points. The really really strange and just weird CIA woman and that whole thing was ... just kind of random. But I really enjoyed it and got invested. Good acting from all involved except the CIA woman I'm sure whose acting was OK but just ... weird!"
" A film with lots of twists and turns
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,4,"This is supposed to be a action movie but it has many plots which keeps it twisted. Storyline is very predictable, action is good, acting of Kevin Costner is good. Screenplay is confusing, the movie loses it's plot quite often and will not keep you engaged. Location is great and could've been better provided with a good storyline and direction. Overall a predictable yet confusing movie."
" And the moral of the story is...
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,3,"... that if you're a teenager and you want to have sex and fun, bad things will happen.
I give it 3 stars because it was watchable, but the storyline is really bad."
" ...a trashy but fun vehicle for Kevin Costner.
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,7,"Director McG teams up with a grizzled Kevin Costner and a story by French populist Luc Besson for a terrific collision of action, family drama and nutty humour."
" Costner's Character Keeps Getting Better and Better
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,9,"18 September 2014. 3 Days To Kill offers up one more opportunity for Kevin Costner to reprise his typical bent out of shape, aging male character to attempt to deal with more of his Existential Angst (Bull Durham, 1988; Dances with Wolves, 1990; The Body Guard, 1992; The Perfect World, 1993; Water World, 1995; The Tin Cup, 1996; The Postman 1997; The Guardian 2006; Mr. Brooks, 2007; . What's enjoyable, is that Kevin keeps getting better and better with more depth and nuanced scripts that offer him to keep developing his own screen persona with effect. For some, Kevin's repetitive routine might get boring and lame, but for those who appreciate how a continuing to evolve human characterization can add heft to a performance and a movie as well as the actors around him, Kevin stands out with this focused selection in movie parts.3 Days To Kill sticks mostly to an anti-action thriller, cerebral serio-comic assassination movie genre with a nice, sharp, witty dialogue along with an edgy black darkness that is oftentimes impossible to master well. Now more refined and less flashy than True Lies (1994) or screw-ball comedy of The Whole Nine Yards (2000) or even the somewhat more refined Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2007) or less less successful Ashton Kutcher's Killers (2010) or even the more elevated presentation of The Matador (2005), 3 Days to Kill relies on sharper irony, more incisor conflict between the incongruous tone of killing and sometimes the oddity of humor that breaks the severity of the reality (like real life).More recently, both Wild Target (2010) and Daisy & Violet (2011) have captured the fascinating oil and water blend of death and humor in the same movie. 3 Days to Kill is a great vehicle for the smaller segment of thriller fans who enjoy the twisting mental gyrations of humor and black comedy offered up a consummate and well deserved actor. What is really hopeful for our society is that this under-played action movie seems to have the highest ratings coming from males under 18. Could it be that a new generation of youth are growing up with more appreciation of good, witty dialogue in conflicting situations rather than the extended violence and mindless actions so often portrayed in the movies?"
" You will enjoy it better if you don't take this too seriously.
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,8,A lot of reviews are pointing out the logical flaws in the movie. That's the problem of the today's cinemagoers. They want a film to be logically flawless. But a movie is not a scientific thesis or a law trial. Movies need not be logically flawless. Ask your left brain to give it a break and enjoy this movie. It's entertaining.
" Vintage Kevin Costner
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,5,"3 Days to Kill"" is slightly unusual for Kevin Costner. We have seen him in action pictures such as ""Wyat Earp"" back in 1994 and ""Revenge"" 1990. Since then, he has stuck to sports dramas. Director McG doesn't exactly have a good track record: ""Charlie's Angels"" & ""This Means War"" and Producer Luc Besson ""The Professional"" is known for making it one of the best action pictures of all time. With ""3 Days to Kill,"" they plunk the vintage actor into action sequences with Besson's usual cinema effects regarding crossing stories. Not much else!It's about a CIA agent, Ethan (Kevin Costner), who soon discovers that he has terminal brain cancer and given only a few months to live. Hence, Ethan decides to spend his remaining time to try and fix his relationship with his family, which he lost while keeping his career a secret. When a German arts trafficker, The Wolf, surfaces, CIA assassin, Vivi Delay (Amber Heard) tasks Ethan with one last assignment to hunt him down and kill him, in exchange, he will receive a serum that could extend his life.Luc Besson is known for his craftsmanship in French cinema. ""The Professional"" was a masterpiece of thriller, spy, and acton. McG is known for his comedy approaches, and because of that, it does not work for a far-out action picture. A mixture of overblown response, choppy story and a full result that hurts. There is an excellent concept here that would have worked great if Luc Besson stepped into the director's chair. Why they would get a comedy director for an action picture is a lousy decision no matter how you look at it. Especially when I am sure Luc Besson would have directed this with no ease. After all, he wrote it. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but perhaps quick cash is the real answer.No surprise, it starts with an opening shootout. Soon after, Ethan discovers he has cancer and moves back to his flat in Paris. I don't think Kevin Costner speaks French because he doesn't speak French in the movie. There could have been an effort made, but the plot doesn't stop. He retires for about a day and gets thrown back into a dumb scenario where he must go back to his old life to obtain a drug that will prolong his cancer. Yeah right! At this point, the plot is already dumb enough to continue the film. Amber Heard shows up attempting to be a badass; she was more of a badass in ""Drive Angry"" and suckers Ethan into doing the job.Criss-cross action sequences with Ethan attempting to fix his family before he dies, and you got Luc Besson's French cinema-style twist, this I like. The problem is the film becomes overcrowded with dumb and predictable action sequences that, by the second act, we have had enough. It doesn't work, and it's because of McG. After doing some research, I discovered he is originally a music video director as well. That says it all. Bad decisions all around!There is not much more to say about the movie. It's loud, dumb, predictable and made for quick cash. For what it is, I don't recommend ""3 Days to Kill"", the title alone says lazy, but for those looking for a sluggish action picture that stands below several action masterpieces, you will get what you are looking for out of it. Kevin Costner does try to give us a somewhat good performance, and he does try his best with the material, but for all intents and purposes, this could've been a much better movie."
" I enjoyed it very much
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,8,"Enjoyable film, you won't write home about it but a good movie nonetheless"
" 3 Days to Kill
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,4,"I saw the DVD cover for this movie a couple of times in shops, I may have even seen a short TV trailer for it when it came out, it must have been one of those quick in-quick out of cinemas films, but I was up for giving it a try, despite poor critic reviews, written by Luc Besson and Adi Hasak. Directed by McG (Charlie's Angels, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, Terminator Salvation). Basically Ethan Renner (Kevin Costner), originally from Pittsburgh, is an experienced CIA agent on the hunt to capture the Albino (Tómas Lemarquis), lieutenant to an arms trafficker called the Wolf (Richard Sammel). During a chase, Renner becomes dizzy, he only manages to cripple the Albino, shooting him in the leg, before blacking out and allowing him to escape. In hospital, Renner is diagnosed with terminal brain cancer which has spread to his lungs, he is given only a few months to live, and will not see the next Christmas. For years he has kept his deadly career a secret from his estranged wife Christine (One Hour Photo's Connie Nielsen) and teenage daughter Zooey (Hailee Steinfeld), he decides to spend his remaining time trying to fix his relationship with his family. Renner returns to Paris, where he and his family live separately, he finds the Réunion family of Jules (Eriq Ebouaney) squatting in his apartment, the police tell him he cannot evict them until after the winter. Renner makes an awkward reconnection with Christine, and tells her of his terminal illness, she allows him to reconnect with Zooey, and to look after her while she away on business. Elite CIA assassin Vivi Delay (Amber Heard), a ""Top Shelf agent"", meets with Renner and recruits him to find and kill the Wolf, in exchange for an experimental drug that could extend his life significantly, he reluctantly agrees, wanting more time with his family. While carrying out his mission, Renner is fighting the hallucinogenic effect of the medicine, which occurs whenever his heart rate goes too high, and which he can only control by consuming alcohol. Renner must also deal with Zooey's school problems, including her habit of sneaking out and partying, he manages to keep her out of trouble, and slowly re-establishes a father relationship with her, which impresses his wife. After kidnapping the gang's limousine driver to gain information, he tracks the Wolf and the Albino into the subway, but they gain the upper hand when he is disabled by hallucinations. The Albino attempts to kill him by pushing in front of an oncoming train, but Renner manages to push the Albino onto the track instead, while the Wolf escapes. The family is invited to a party thrown by Zooey's boyfriend's father, who happens to be the Wolf's business partner. Renner manages to protect Christine and Zooey, kill all the Wolf's men, and traps the Wolf in an elevator before breaking the cables, the Wolf survives the free-fall drop and is severely injured. Renner is again disabled, but he feels guilty for all the damage his work has caused to his family, he is unable to pull the trigger, he drops his gun, allowing the Wolf to reach for it. Vivi intervenes and kicks the gun back to Renner, telling him to finish the job and kill the Wolf, Renner refuses, saying he promised his wife he would quit, so Vivi kills the Wolf. In the end, Renner is at last retired, and has survived for Christmas, he is spending it at a beach house with Zooey and Christine, he receives a small package containing a vial of the cancer medicine, Vivi is seen on a hill close by watching him open the package. Also starring Marc Andréoni as Mitat Yilmaz, Bruno Ricci as Guido, Jonas Bloquet as Hugh and Patty Hannock as School Principal. Costner is just about convincing as a tough action hero, Heard does fine as the moody colleague, and Steinfeld is likeable in her time onscreen, it is a fairly simple and predictable story, a dying agent tempted to do one last job, while also trying to make amends with his loved ones, there are bits where it will inevitably slow down, but the sequences with guns blazing and high speed chases are exciting, all in all it is an alright crime thriller. Okay!"
" A movie that has all the elements from action to drama.
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,10,"My wife and I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. The acting and story line were right up there with other movies like Taken. Kevin Costner held the movie together like glue. The story unfolds around his life which is about to come to an end due to a terminal illness. His career as a government hired killer/operative is over, but for one last job. What was different about this movie is it explores drama, and action. The drama coming from how he wants to rekindle his relationships with his daughter and and X wife. . It's all nicely put together with some light fun moments and some on the edge of your seat action scenes. The balance of drama and action allowed the characters to be developed more than say a a full blown action movie which wec liked. We liked the balance and so possibly this will work better for those wanting a good mix. To sum up the action scenes are well done and are numerous but are part of the bigger picture and story.
Fully recommend this movie as a good watch and is the best movie we have seen in the last 6 months. If you are a hard out action fan this movie might leave you a bit short changed but for us it was a great balance and a welcome relief from some other stuff we've seen lately."
" Funny/Quirky
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,9,"I don't see it, but it seems any movie I like has a Luc Besson touch. This in no exception. The plot is simple yet the complexities are hysterical."
" overall not a bad action movie
",2018-08-02 00:00:00,3,"3 days to kill 
2014
Director: McG
Screenplay: Luc Besson and Adi Hasak 
Cast: Kevin Costner, Amber Heard. Hailee Steinfeld, Connie Nielson and Richard Sammel 
Plot: A dying CIA agent takes on a mission in order to earn an experimental cure. 
Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you what people are willing to do for family. The direction and screenplay aren't bad. The casting and acting aren't bad either. All in all I would give this three out of a possible five stars."
" Do Actors actually read scripts before signing on.
",2018-06-21 00:00:00,2,"This movie can be compared to a bad Asian Karate movie. No plot, story just bad actions scenes where they continuously fight to the point of it being ridiculous. You can only what so much then gets boring to the point of laughable. This was obviously just a paycheck for Costner. I sure he slept though his takes. I wonder if he even watched it himself."
" For those people who pick on a good movie, as the worst they have seen, but dross passes muster
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,1,"I was reading the reviews of the brilliant FENCES - where people were saying it was so bad etc. well guess what that was double racism, as it was about the ex-slaves of America in a contemporary setting - but it was also obviously hand-picked by Denzel Washington, for production - so what are you really saying?
Anyway Kevin Costner's 3 Days to A Kill is the worst movie so far in the 20th C, I think -- the bit I was watching, anyway. And as I write crits without polluting my senses, as you don't need to be run over by a train to know how that feels; as well you don't need to hear the end of a song to know you don't like it. This doesn't apply to artists, because when I first heard Amy Winehouse, I thought she sounded like a female Louie Armstrong and I was later to learn her complete oeuvre is brilliant. Anyway (again please note this is the correct way to review a film, you need to discuss cultural relevant matters, you don't just give a blow-by-blow account of the plot!) - back to the film - In it they relate killing about 6 people w/ the boss woman entering on stiletto heels - and a big emphasis on and close up shots of her stiletto heels, stiletto heels apparently is the signifier of ' you have to die' and then he takes the boss who arrived later back to some apartment where there was a negro woman and her young children -- and he said to the kids who on enquiring what he was doing: I am going to be in the bathroom, so Do Not Disturb Me, and the kid retorts: Are you the good guy or the bad guy? And then he begins to gaffer tape this boss guy to the bathroom fittings - when the phone rang, and it was the headmistress of his daughter's school - she needed to talk to him about his daughter, and he turns to that boss guy and says: We are going to school ! Luckily at that point I was saved by an advert. Yep poss could be the worst, and another thing was Kevin Costner had grown a short beard, for the role but it was a real Neanderthal effort -- he looked strange, take that... Costner !"
" What a disappointment
",2018-03-24 00:00:00,3,There's not much to recommend this film except Kevin Costner's good looks. Don't bother.
" Subtle, different, enjoyable.
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,8,"Costner is great as the quietly dying action hero. The story is of course ridiculous, and unfortunately Amber Heard is both terrible and unbelievable in a one dimensional nonsensically evil role. But the action is great, the pacing is perfect and the settings are refreshingly new and different. It's not a typical action film and it's all in all enjoyable, hence the 8 stars."
" Touching movie
",2017-12-18 00:00:00,8,I like the poignant interactions of Costner with his ex-wife but particularly with his daughter. He learned to appreciate them but learn their importance. It was a spy movie with a conscious.
" Really Great movie - why such low rating????
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,8,"We can't understand why this movie has such a low rating – it's Luc Besson writing & humour at its most entertaining and Costner – like fine wine – gets better with age – is just great – no flab – it's kinda like Taken but with a few home truths (which came later with Taken.) If you want a bit of thriller entertainment of an evening, this does it for us."
" Exciting and funny action flick
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,7,"A terminally ill former CIA agent is given one last assignment in exchange for an experimental hallucinogenic drug that may extend his life, and he struggles to reconnect with his teenage daughter with the time he has left.I know what you're thinking: this is a Nicolas Cage action movie. You're right. In Matchstick Men, Stolen, and Rage, Nicolas Cage has to bond with/rescue his teenage daughter. In Gone in Sixty Seconds, Stolen, and Rage, Nicolas Cage comes back for ""just one more job"". In Bringing Out the Dead, Nicolas Cage hallucinates over the course of three days. And in Dying of the Light, Nicolas Cage plays a CIA agent dying of a terminal illness.One more: In Drive Angry, Cage's costar is Amber Heard, and he has three days to ""complete his mission"". Kevin Costner's costar in 3 Days to Kill is Amber Heard. And as is evident by the title, he has three days to complete his assignment.So, yes, you've seen this movie before. And during every since scene, you're keenly aware that Nicky Cage could have played the Kevin Costner role. However, with the well-known plot and without Nicky Cage, this is still a very entertaining movie! Kevin Costner is very likable, and there are several hilarious scenes in which he's torturing someone or about to kill someone but is interrupted by his daughter's embarrassing ""I Don't Care"" ringtone and has to juggle playing Daddy and being an assassin. The action scenes are exciting and sometimes cringe-worthy (in a ""She's going to get decapitated; I can't look!"" way), but thankfully the movie stays away from blood and guts. It's really very good, and I recommend it for those who like a little humor in their action flicks. Amber Heard got on my nerves a little, but only because she had a major attitude problem and wore black leather corsets for absolutely no reason. But all in all, her part is small, and Kevin Costner's parental charm more than made up for it."
" Just plain stupid
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,3,"Ridiculous films are everywhere you look these days and '3 Days to Kill' is yet another one of them. From the first scene to the last, this film makes very little sense and is constructed in such a messy way that it only adds more confusion to an already nonsensical plot. To be fair, the actors can't be blamed for this. I thought Kevin Costner and Hailee Steinfeld delivered good performances considering the content they were working with.The blame lies firmly with the director and writers. The plot is just too ridiculous and far-fetched to be taken seriously, and the weak script certainly doesn't help the film's case either.'3 Days to Kill' is a poor action film all round. Even if you're patient enough to make it to the end, the illogical and unsatisfying conclusion is just as frustrating as the rest of the film."
