" Great fun
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,10,"I really like this franchise, all 3 movie's to date are excellent fun. This was my favourite, excellent fun for all ages."
" Hotel Transylvania 2
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,4,"The first Hotel Transylvania was a below average and fairly forgettable computer-animated movie, I didn't have my hopes high for the sequel, but I gave it a chance, seeing the slightly better reviews. Basically, in Transylvania, vampire Mavis (Selena Gomez) and her human fianc√© Johnny (Andy Samberg) are finally married, with the approval of her father Dracula (Adam Sandler, also producing), and the world is now aware and accepting of the existence of monsters. Mavis later reveals to Drac that she is pregnant, and later she gives birth to a ginger-haired baby boy named Dennis. On his fifth birthday, Dennis (Asher Blinkoff) has yet to grow his fangs and Drac worries his grandson may remain human without any vampire powers. With potential dangers raising a baby in Transylvania, Mavis considers moving to where Johnny grew up, but Drac disapproves of this. Drac tells Johnny, who wants to stay at the hotel, to take Mavis to California to meet his parents, Mike (Nick Offerman) and Linda (Megan Mullally), and to keep her distracted so that she will not move. Meanwhile, Drac and his monster friends Frankenstein ""Frank"" (Kevin James), Wayne the werewolf (Steve Buscemi), Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade), Murray the mummy (Keegan-Michael Key), and Blobby (Jonny Solomon) ""babysit"" Dennis. Drac wants to train and develop Dennis to become a monster, to no avail. Drac takes Dennis to his childhood summer camp, Camp Winnepacaca, where he learned to hone his vampire abilities. He discovers that the camp has become a more child-friendly and safer than he was there. Drac stubbornly believes Dennis is a ""late fanger"", and throws him for a tall, unstable tower to transform into a bat. But Drac is forced to fly down and rescue him at the last second. The stunt is filmed by the campers and uploaded online, and Mavis is angry and gets herself and Johnny back to Transylvania. Drac and his friends reach the hotel seconds after Mavis. She confronts her father for putting Dennis in grave danger and his inability to accept that he is human. She states she will move out of the hotel after Dennis' 5th birthday. Drac feels guilty, Mavis says he may have let humans into the hotel but hasn't let them into his heart. Mavis invites Vlad (Mel Brooks), her grandfather and Drac's father, to Dennis' birthday party. Vlad is much worse, as he hates humans, so Drac tells Johnny and the other human partygoers to disguise themselves as monsters. Vlad arrives with his monstrous bat-like servant Bela (Rob Riggle) to meet his great-grandson for the first time. Vlad says that fear should cause Dennis's fangs to sprout and possesses a stage performer dressed as ""Kakie the Cake Monster to scare Dennis, but Drac shields his frightened grandson. Vlad is outraged when Drac reveals that he has accepted humans as guests in his hotel and let Mavis marry Johnny and had a human child. Drac confronts Vlad about how humans are different now. Mavis becomes upset with her grandfather's behaviour. While the family argues, Dennis is upset and leaves the hotel, entering the forest with Wayne's daughter, Winnie (Sadie Sandler, Adam's daughter), who has a crush on Dennis, to hide in her treehouse. They are attacked by Bela, who overheard Mavis say that Dennis is a human. Bela injures Winnie and threatens to destroy the hotel, Dennis is angered and instantly grows his fangs and his vampire abilities manifest. He begins to fight Bela, who calls his giant-bat minions. Drac, Johnny, Mavis, Dennis, the Loughran family, and the rest of the monsters team up to defeat Bela's minions and drive them away. Bela is livid and attempts to kill Johnny with a stake. However, having been won over with humans and monsters coexisting, Vlad shrinks Bela, saving Johnny. Bela then tries to flee but is caught and licked excessively by the werewolf pups. With Dennis having vampire abilities, Johnny and Mavis decide to stay in Transylvania, and the party resumes. Also starring Fran Drescher as Eunice, Molly Shannon as Wanda, Wayne's World star Dana Carvey as Dana, Chris Kattan as Kakie, Sunny Sandler (Adam's daughter) as Baby Dennis / Vampire Kid, Jon Lovitz as the Phantom of the Opera, Luenell as Shrunken Heads, Jared Sandler (Adam's nephew) as Tourist Driver, and Nick Swardson as Kelsey. The cast are all chosen well for their parts, the characters are all likeable, the slapstick jokes and spoofs of horror movie things are amusing, the plot may be thing, but it is slightly more enjoyable than its predecessor, kids watching will certainly have fun, a reasonable computer-animated comedy. Okay!"
" For all ages? You betcha!!
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,10,"The funniest scene is the battle between Dracula's family and father vs. his minions!! Dracula's grandson turns into a bat, so LOL!!"
" Does nothing to improve the franchise nor the company.
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,1,"Well, heck. In 2015, Sony Animation made a SEQUEL to Hotel Transylvania. Sigh. This movie is just as bad as the first, if not worse. The 'humor' in the movie is not funny and none of it made me laugh. Adam Sandler does badly yet again at playing Dracula, who is just as unlikable as he was in the original. Selena Gomez and Mel Brooks are both too talented for this movie."
" Colorful and fun
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,10,One of the best animations for children and adults. Each part is interesting and exciting. Each character has its own distinctive features and makes you smile. The perfect comedy for a Sunday afternoon.
" Almost as good as the first one.
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,8,"Thank goodness they knew what they got right in the first movie and kept most of it in this one.The characters are all there but this time it's focused on Dracula's grandson and his desire for him to grow up as a vampire. My little one has made me watch this at least as many times as the first movie and it holds up.The jokes are pretty funny even if some of them are just Sandler yelling in a Transylvanian accent, although I got tired of him calling his grandsons name all the time, that bit got old after awhile.I would give this one a 7.5 but since there are no halfsies I am rounding up. A really enjoyable movie with a good cast. One of Adam Sandler's better comedies."
" A fun sequel
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,7,"Hotel Transylvania still has its charm, mostly thanks to its stylish animation and the clever direction given by Genndy Tartakovsky.There were also a couple of elements that made think that the subsequent sequels were going to have a slightly more serious tone as the conflict in this movie seemed more intense than in the previous movie, but I still appreciate Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation as a decent addition to franchise anyway."
" Compared to #3 way better, more kid friendly. But First one still best one.
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,8,"Although say with Blade 2 some thing that one is better than the first I never did like the second one. Never watched the third one...yet... But this one expanded the family a bit and those kids gotta get in a room together or something. Then again hey Dennis is lucky, he's git a girl chasing him. I was the other way around. I caught one but she was slippery so we'll leave that there.. ;) The cartoon thing at the end is silly. Wall-E seems to have started it , never understood that. but it carries that on. And goes into overkill on the next one. This movie was just pure family fun. No conflicts etc..

" Could've been better
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,6,"I was not interested. That alone should get less than a 5 from me. But I gave it a 6 thanks to 2 things. First, this movie is for kids, and hilarious and silly scenes are occasional. Second, the last section at the birthday party is what saved the whole movie from being a complete drag. They should have brought some hints of that to the early story so we could feel the story more reasonable. Other than that, details are loose, no suitable tensions or problems, which will make you doze off soon."
" The spell is broken
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,5,"I loved the first movie so I was expecting a lot, and, well, I got a lot. I think every idea at the brainstorm made the movie. It was a stack of funny scenes, but not one as brilliant as in the first movie. On top of that a sauce of lessons in life and soggy family values. This missed the vision, shwung and smart jokes of part one."
" Not being as good as the first film, it is a good sequel.
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,7,"This film is the sequel to ""Hotel Transylvania"", an expected sequel given the success of the first film, which helped Sony Pictures Animation to assert itself as one of the great animation studios. Although not as good as the first film, it is not far behind and manages to entertain the audience very well.In this film, we start by watching the expected wedding of Mavis, Count Dracula's daughter, with the human Jonathan. After a short time, they both have a son, and the Count will turn out to be an affectionate and loving grandfather. It happens that he wants his grandson to be a vampire too. Thus, as the child approaches the age of five, the time at which the vampire's canine teeth should appear, the Count reveals himself to be increasingly obsessed with that idea, forcing Mavis to take action.The film is quite good but the story told is not as effective as that of the first film. The characters are the same, with the addition of several humans from Jonathan's family, but to whom little relevance is given. The jokes appear punctually and work well, being usually played by the Count and the main monsters, who are no longer able to scare, behaving in a less monstrous way. The dialogues also work wonderfully. The ending was the most downright negative point of the film, as it completely clashes with what happened before and has almost no connection with the main plot. It is as if it has been glued to spit to give the film an extra half hour in length.Genndy Tartakovsky again assures the direction and does it well, keeping the bulk of the team and the cast of the previous film. Adam Sandler continues to give voice to Dracula and prove to be very good at it. Equally good were the contributions of Kevin James, Steve Buscemi, Megan Mullally, Mel Brooks and David Spade. Selena Gomes and Andy Samberg also did a good job, but their characters have been relegated to a frankly secondary role and have been quite underdeveloped, with Mavis permanently irritated and Jonathan even more stupid and immature than in the first film.Technically, the film is based on computer animation and good quality CGI. I believe that the visual quality is even better than that of the first film. Good colors, brightness and sharpness are very evident characteristics here. The choice of songs and the soundtrack worked much better than in the first film. I especially liked the song ""I'm In Love With a Monster"", it is in your ear and has rhythm."
" Good story; needed to be funny more often; great ending
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,8,"Just watched it.-Good simple story. Grandpa really loves his grandson. His love is perfectly shown in this movie, just his love for his daughter was perfectly shown in the first movie.-Sometimes the movie is funny, but I wish it was funnier. This is why it lost 2 stars from me - because it needs more comedy.Again, the ending was great and satisfying.Conclusion: it needed to be funny more often. Story was good. Ending was great. It was a fun movie to watch. I would recommend it. 8/10"
" Good addition to the series
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,7,"This film has the same excellent, fun characters from the original Hotel Transylvania. They are expressive and have a lot of funny moments and gags. This sequel adds two more major ones in the form of Dennis and Vlad. While Dennis is nothing special, he is the emotional core of the film. Vlad is more like a foil to Dracula - He is to Drac as Drac is to Mavis (minus the zany plans of course). There are also some minor characters like Johnny's family who also contribute to the comedy. This sequel is an improvement over the first film in that it has more of a convincing, overarching storyline that expands on the original."
" Wonderful Family Film
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,7,"To this day I have not seen the first Hotel Transylvania. I watched this because my teenage sister insisted Adam Sandler and Selena Gomez were genuinely good in both the first and this sequel. She gave me what little information I needed to know to understand who was getting married in the beginning, but this is a movie all on its own. It could exist outside of the Hotel Transylvania franchise and still hold up. I never like pop culture references in movies as I do feel they'll be dated by the time the film comes out. This is no exception, but I don't drag my feet whenever I willingly re-watch this when it comes on TV."
" Sweet but the first and third movie where better
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,7,The story is sweet but I prefer the first and third because of the focus in the story.
" Not that good as expect
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,5,"""You are what you are. You can't be changed"". There are many thought-provoking lines in the film, but the plot is still mediocre. More funny than the first one, but the directors and the writer ignore the rationality of logic and plot, The ending is a bit awkward."
" Cuter and just as silly, but not as funny.
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,4,"It's just as silly as the original and has the cute factor this time around, but it's nowhere near as funny. The animation's good and there are some humourous moments, but the visual gags and modern technology jokes just aren't funny and the new characters aren't interesting. The story's ok with a good moral message and the finale was good, but overall, it's a forgettable and mediocre animated movie."
" Nice
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,6,"After presenting the fun animations O Bicho vai Pegar (2006), T√° Dando Onda (2007), T√° Chovendo Hamb√∫rguer (2009), Os Smurfs (2011), Opera√ß√£o Presente (2011), Piratas Pirados! (2012), Hotel Transilv√¢nia (2012), Os Smurfs 2 (2013) and T√° Chovendo Hamb√∫rguer 2 (2013), Sony Pictures Animation brings to the public the continuation of one of its coolest cartoons, Hotel Transilv√¢nia 2 (Hotel Transylvania 2), by Emmy Award winning director, Genndy Tartakovsky (known for the cartoons Dexter's Laboratory, Samurai Jack and Star Wars: Clone Wars).When the production of some sequels is announced, our first thoughts are mostly: ""Does this film need a sequel?"" or ""Will the sequel surpass the original feature film?""I have to confess that in 2012, when I went to the cinema to watch Hotel Transylvania (Hotel Transylvania) in theaters, I went without any expectations and left completely dazzled by the animation, that besides bringing an impeccable animation, it had a great plot and very charismatic characters .When I heard about the sequel, I was happy and worried, but last weekend, I had the chance to watch the new animated film and left the cinema even more surprised, because Sony managed to make an animated film superior to the original, brought new characters that besides being cute, add the story and presented a light and tasty movie to see with family.For those who don't know the plot, this time, Drac's gang is back and everything seems to be changing for the better at Hotel Transylvania, where monsters and humans now live in peace. Dracula's strict ""monster only"" policy for the hotel finally relaxed and its doors were also opened to human guests. However, behind fa√ßade attitudes, Drac is concerned to see that his adorable half-human, half-vampire grandson, Dennis, shows no signs of being a vampire.So while Mavis is busy visiting human in-laws in the company of Johnny - and immersed in her own big culture shock - ""vovamp"" Drac recruits his great friends Frank, Murray, Wayne and Griffin to get Dennis through a ""monster training"" camp and let your monster side speak louder than your human side. What they don't know is that Drac's surly and very old-fashioned father, Vlad, is about to visit his family at the hotel to celebrate his great-grandchild's five-year anniversary and when Vlad finds out that his great-grandson is not of pure lineage - and that humans are now welcome at the Hotel Transylvania - things are going to get complicated for everyone.Another highlight of the animated film is its soundtrack, which brings two songs from the rising band Fifth Harmony, whose single, ""Worth It"", carved out its place on the charts all summer. The girls sing the opening song and the animated credits, one of them called ""I'm in Love with a Monster"", which has seen its video clip by more than 7 million people in less than a month."
" Direct to video feel.
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,7,"Let's be honest. This sequel was unnecessary. The first one ended perfectly. That being said, I enjoyed this movie. Although the plot was thin, and some parts made it seem like a direct to video movie, overall, I found the movie cute and fun. The plot didn't feel like a rehash of the first one, but they didn't exactly put effort into this one. There are a few funny one-liners and zingers, but the plot is not well thought out. There were a few genuinely heartfelt moments, and by the end of the movie I was satisfied, but again, the plot was thin. There are a few moments in the film where I was saying ""What?"" (and not in a surprised, excited way), simply because they don't make sense. A lot more effort could have been put into this movie, but I don't hate it. I liked it, but it could have been a lot better.
Grade: C 7/10 3/5 stars"
" Better than the first
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,10,Better than the first. The great characters from the first film continue and even added wonderful new characters.

" Denise Is Love
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,10,"Love it so much, Denisovitch is the cutest boy ever I love him soooo sooo much"
" I'd say skip the first and watch this
",2019-11-05 00:00:00,7,"OK, I know the first one wasn't exactly a dignified viewing experience but I think you will be pleasantly surprised with how much thought they put into this.We find among the cartoonish buffoonery what I thought was an intriguing and thoughtful rumination on the changing time embodied by the clashing values of two different generations on what's best for the a third."
" Hotel Transylvania 2
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,2,"It's mainly composed of unfunny jokes that long overstay their welcome. That is, what little welcome they had in the first place, if any."
" ""Old = Bad, New = Good""
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,4,"The movie is absolutely enjoyable and genuinely adorable when we expend time with Dracula's gang and his grandson teaching him how to become a vampire, but it becomes absolutely insufferable when they cut to Dracula's daughter shenanigans who despite having had a character arc in the firs movie she still as dislikable, spoiled and disrespectful as she was. Or very other time they make Dracula look like a fool for staying true to his traditions as if they were wrong.Including that kind of characters is not a problem in a movie, but in this one they are part of the main leads and it makes it clear that between the ""Old School"" ones or the teen ones you are supposed to be on the teen side y continuously bashing the others and never the teens. which makes you feel wrong for sympathizing more with the ""old school"" but much likable and deep monster gang.Just like the first movie, but now in larger scale, this sequel keeps telling that adults are dumb and their values are outdated while worships irresponsible teenagers whose biggest merit is to expend hours on the cellphone and skateboarding and telling their parents how wrong they are for not think like them."
" A fun sequel that provides plenty of laughs
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,8,"The opening scenes of this animated sequel take us from the wedding of Mavis, Dracula's daughter, and Johnny, her human boyfriend, to the birth of their son Dennis. Almost five years pass and Drac is concerned that he will grow up human rather than develop fangs and become a vampire... even if he claims not to care. Mavis worries that a hotel full of monsters might not be the safest place for him and considers moving away. She and Johnny go on holiday to his parents in California to investigate the possibility of moving there. Dennis is left with his grandfather, who promises to look after at the hotel but in fact takes him to the places he went as a young vampire. He hope they will frighten him into developing his fangs but discovers everything is depressingly safe now. When he eventually finds something dangerous it isn't long before Mavis finds out and she is not pleased.Having enjoyed the first film more than I expected I was keen to watch this but still a little trepidatious in case it failed to live up to the first... thankfully I think it does. The story is pretty good and it provides plenty of laughs that are suitable for children and adults alike... Blobby was hilarious! It also provides a few child-friendly scares; slightly more than I expected in a UK 'U' rated film... I suspect it came close to getting a PG certificate. The animation is of a high quality and the voice cast, which includes the likes of Adam Sandler, Selena Gomez and Steve Buscemi, does a fine job bringing the characters to life; none of them sounded overly cartoony. I was initially unsure about separating the characters for much of the film but it works well and we spend the right amount of time with each group. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the original film even if some scenes may be a little scary for very young viewers."
" More of the same
",2019-08-02 00:00:00,6,"This sequel is slightly a notch better than the original due to it being funnier and the plot moves at a quicker pace. Although nothing really stands out, and this film is essentially the same as the original with a different plot."
" Hotel Transylvania 2
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,7,7/10 - fun follow-up that lives up to the original
" A new addition to the family
",2019-06-28 00:00:00,4,"There's recycling ideas and there's recycling an overly recycled idea.
This movie hardly offers something we haven't seen before, and doesn't deliver the fun visuals we've come to depend on when a plot is thin."
" this is just mean
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,3,"I liked first HT very much. and almost until end HT2 was even better, more deeper for human-monster relationships. and they failed it completely when boy become vampire. yes it was critical moment and touching thing, but it ruined HT completely. and Dracula's words ""human vampire or unicorn"" after all was just it, words. no dramatic experience, no soul-touching movement, grandson become vampire, Dracs vampire line going on, no puny human as grandchild, whooohooo. really? this was meant to touch us, but really, what was that, just excuse for drama for whole film until end ""battle""...and SANDLER. too much Sandler in Dracula, just too much"
" Not bad

" Tricky second movie
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,6,Was unsure what to expect from this sequel. But it still held its own. Not as good as the original but still very entertaining
" Takes out Everything that Worked with the Original and Keeps Everything that Didn't,
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,2,"Hotel Transylvania 2 is a horrendous movie with a very poorly developed script and a talented voice cast that unfortunately do not do very much to save this mess. I quite enjoyed the first movie, it was no Shrek or Toy Story, but it does manage to find a nice balance between childish and adult humour, this film however makes literally no effort to appeal to an older age demographic. It I s filled with fart jokes and silly animation for a toddler to glare at in amazement, but offers nothing to stimulate the parents.It makes the obvious sequel decisions of introducing new characters and sending them to new locations, but it never does anything interesting or new with these concepts.A snooze fest for anyone over the age of 10. While the first movie was fun and witty, Hotel Transylvania 2 is just here for the money.
Dracula grows concerned when his new grandson is not showing his vampire side."

",2019-02-05 00:00:00,6,"The movie is definitely a fun time pass. It will not disappoint. The plot is original, however, i think that the biggest advantage of an animated cartoon movie is that you can use your imagination wildly which I found was lacking a bit. But, there were still some scenes which were good enough like that double-bristled toothbrush for the fangs.. it was cool!!"
" as good as the first one (a little worse)
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,6,"Still a likable film but arguably less funny and kind of the same conflict as the first one

" Fairly entertaining

However he's no longer interested in ""kids"" movies so I had to make do with watching this at home on TV. Never as good. Anyway there is plenty of fun to be had here, it starts off really well but I felt that the second half was not as good. Not as good as the original but entertaining none the less."
" A fast paced, funny sequal, with dazzaling animation.
",2018-12-08 00:00:00,7,"This movie's animation is just a fast paced, witty and entertaining. I do like the story and the characters new and old are all interesting. Although it's not as fresh as the firsr one, it is still an entertaing sequal."
" Blobby was enough to make me laugh.
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,8,"I loved the original, I gave it an 8, I love the sequel even more, I will give it 8 once more. The jokes are over the top hilarious, Blobby is the best thing I've seen and it made me laugh on so many occasions, it is fun, it is positive, it is everything a kid would want and a parent would need to relax his nerves. An awesome, awesome animated movie to watch. All hail, ADAM SANDLER !"
" Ending of this movie is much better than the first half
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,7,"At first, the beginning of the movie is plot-less and has no direction. It is confusing as to what the movie is trying to achieve. However, it is the ending of the movie that becomes much better in a final conclusion to the main plot, which becomes evident only later on. The movie could have been better and more in-depth for the main character, Mavis.7/10"
" Not particularly original or clever
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,6,"Hotel Transylvania 2 is harmless fun. This sequel is not particularly original or clever, but there are some funny moments to keep the parents entertained while the kids are mesmerized. Plus, the animation is well done. I think Adam Sandler and his buddies might be better suited for animated features rather than those live action missteps they've been doing lately."
" A good sequel!
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,6,Let's get this said the first movie was a masterpiece so I truly understand why they made a sequel. Packed up with a whole lot of humor this movie is getting the expected rating of a sequel movie but when it was time to end the movie I think they kinda lost it. The end scene is ment to be some sort of family joy and reassemble but it just made me put my hand in front of my face.
" Another fun enjoyable episode
",2018-10-25 00:00:00,10,"My favorite is still the third though.
I love the witty humor when they poke fun at a few things and the sound track is amazing as always"
" Blah Blah Blah!!!

" Interesting movie
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,10,It's nice to watch!!!! It's one of the best animation and family movie I have watched!!! I really enjoyed watching it and It's good for anyone who likes these type of movies!!!
" Perhaps the screenplay really did just say ""blah, blah, blah.""
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,4,"In a strange way, it sort of hurts to watch 'Hotel Transylvania 2 (2015)'. Perhaps it is because the first film was actually pretty good, or perhaps it's because your boredom soon begins to set into your bones like a deep, unforgiving chill and you want to cringe so incredibly tightly that your face tears itself from your head but you're never quite given the mercy of a moment just strong enough to finish the job. To put it bluntly, this isn't a good film. There might be a chance, however, that I'm wrong and that it isn't all that bad. The usual defence for this type of picture is that ""it's a 'kid's film'."" In that case, I guess the abrasive voice-work (which was, I recall, less grating in the series' initial outing), the slightly unsettling and consistently bone-breaking animation (which, again, I remember to have found somewhat charming in the first flick), the egregiously greedy Sony product placement, the over-the-top and usually too-childish-for-children humour, the brash and out-of-place action-scene finale and the tried-and-tested central message that's completely back-tracked upon in the movie's final moments are actually 'good enough' for the young target audience of the piece. Then again, 'kid's film' or not, I think everyone deserves better than this. 4/10"
" BLAH! BLAH! BLAH!
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,10,"Yes, I liked this film more than the critics.In this sequel our mixed human-monster couple get married and Marvis (Selena Gomez) is pregnant in about 2 minutes. Marvis wants the raise the human child in California, which she loves, while Jonathan (Andy Samberg) who is bored with California wants him to stay in Transylvania. The film has humor for adults such as the Picasso painting. Was that ice scream cake or sour scream icing?The film pokes fun at our nanny culture and how we coddle our children with vampire summer camp."
" Good movie
",2018-07-22 00:00:00,10,Watched it directly after watching hotel transylvania 1 loved it amazing movie
" SLIGHTLY BETTER
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,6,"""Everything in the movie (voice acting, direction, animation, comedy, story) is perfectly okay. Nothing's amazing nor annoying. Good for kids and kids at heart. Don't expect a lot or else you'd be bored."" That was my review for the first ""Hotel Transylvania."" For ""Hotel Transylvania 2,"" everything I mentioned in my ""Hotel Transylvania"" review was improved. You could higher expectations but make sure it isn't too high because improving on the first film doesn't really say much."
" Snooze
",2018-07-18 00:00:00,5,"Our lesson in acceptance continues. Part one was about Count Dracula accepting humans. Part two was about Count Dracula accepting his new grandson who's half human half vampire.I fell asleep. The story at its core, while positive, was nothing new at all. Even the characters fell into the same roles. We got to see more bumbling Dracula, mad Mavis, aloof Jonathan, and the rest of the misfit monsters doing what they were best at.The Hotel Transylvania franchise has not grown on me at all. With so many animation franchises out there this one fails to distinguish itself."
" A funny and even sillier sequel.
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,8,"When the first ""Hotel Transylvania"" came out back in 2012, it got a very interesting reaction from critics and audiences alike. Where critics hated it and dismissed it as a throw away animated movie, audiences liked it and called it a fun time. I agreed with the audience. Though I didn't see the first movie as a classic, I still found it fun and silly enough to give it a slight recommendation. With the sequel ""Hotel Transylvania 2"", I actually found it better. It was not only just as funny if not funnier than the first film, but it's even sillier as it has jokes and ideas that I actually could find myself watching again.A few years after the first movie, Dracula's daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) and her new human husband Jonathan (Andy Samberg) have married and had a son whom they name Dennis (Asher Blinkoff). With his fifth birthday approaching, everyone's excited, especially Dracula (Adam Sandler) who sees this as the time where he would grow fangs and become a vampire. However, Mavis is starting to become uncomfortable with having Dennis around the hotel as she feels that he might be a human and is considering moving him and Jonathan to California. Hoping to see if his grandson is a vampire, Dracula sends Mavis and Jonathan to California in hopes of seeing what is like there while he, Frankenstein (Kevin James), Wayne the Werewolf (Steve Buscemi), Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade) and Murray the Mummy (Keegan Michael-Key) try to get Dennis to get his vampire skills in.This film was really funny. Right off the bat, I knew we were in good hands when the film opens up with some clever jokes about how Jonathan's family felt uncomfortable being with monsters at the wedding. The film definitely plays up a lot of the laughs and also scraps most of the juvenile jokes that were in the opening of the first movie. The scenes with Dracula and Dennis were definitely the highlight of the movie. Seeing them bond together as well as seeing Dracula always get constantly annoyed by the other monsters and some of the stuff Dennis says was really funny. The animation is also a step better than the first film. Though I still stand by my claim that both of these films would have been better if they were hand drawn, the computer animation clearly shined in this film. Not only was it better rendered, but the fast paced energy was lots of fun and it did lead to lots of great slapstick moments. The characters were great as well. Not only did the new ones work their magic again, but even some of the new ones were pretty funny. I liked Jonathan's parents and even Dennis who could have been annoying but actually was charming. I even liked seeing him and Wayne's daughter Winnie bonding together. That was such a cute moment and I seriously wish there was more of it because I didn't feel there was enough in the film. The film isn't fully devoid of problems. Once again, the soundtrack is dated. I really hated hearing these modern pop songs in these movies though I will admit it wasn't nearly as bad as the first film. The product placement in this film did drive me crazy as well. This film really had an over reliance on showing Sony's smartphones which included one scene involving Dracula trying to use it. That was a hard scene to sit through. Also, the film did lag in the third act. I'll admit that I was invested throughout most of the film, but near the ending I did get a little bored and even glanced at my watch. Even though that's never a good sign for any movie I watch, it's honestly just a nitpick.""Hotel Transylvania 2"" is better than the first movie with a funnier story, animation that was really stepped up and new characters that definitely blended in well with the old characters. I really do mean it when I say that this film could have some rewatch value as I did find myself really enjoying this movie. It was certainly a lot of fun."
" How could they mess it up so badly??!!
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,2,"Everything that made the first film so cute and lovable is missing from this installment. Cartoonish and silly, this sequel is more annoying than funny and lacks entertainment value, as if an idea was rushed into production. This is definitely for a younger demographic, who might enjoy the bunch of silly, stupid characters, and the plot-less plot."
" Still fun but not as fresh as the first - 68% - (Favorable)
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,7,"Tartakovsky does his thing once again and this movie is beautifully directed with really cool and creative animation. The cast does a pretty good job, the jokes are still pretty smart, and there are some good messages with the new story that is being told. However, this sequel doesn't do much to justify itself as it's pretty much an extension of the first movie. It's still a fun movie for the entire family, but nothing too special."
" Way better than some reviews had you believe
",2018-06-15 00:00:00,10,I actually enjoyed this movie so much. It was almost as good as the first so don't let other reviews fool you into thinking it wasn't that good
" I very good follow up
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,10,"Now Sequels are not very good in most places but Adam Sandler take on the legendary horror movie monster in its second outing is a great, Not all people agree with my opinion but it is a great film and the 3rd film should be great as well."
" Another awful continuous animation movie....
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,1,"AVOID!! They keep churning out these horrible animated films, they only appeal to kids and brain wash them into liking such a bad, nonsensical film. save your children"
" Not as good as the first movie.
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,5,"This movie is mostly filler, but its still fun. The characters are similar to how they were in the last movie, but there is still character development. The animation is cute and fun. Overall, this movie is funny and entertaining, but its a bit too long. And there is too much stupid."
" Hotel Transylvania 2 doesn't learn from the mistakes of its predecessor.
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,4,"Well, we all knew this was going to turn into a ghoulish franchise. In this sequel, Dracula and the gang welcomes his grandson to the family. Adamant that he is more vampire than human, he tries to scare the fangs out of him to prove it. Meanwhile, Mavis explores the human world to gain first hand experience of living in it before making a decision as to whether to stay in Transylvania or not. Also Dracula's father makes an appearance, as does the same recycled jokes and monster puns. This is the pure definition of safe recycling, nothing substantially new was added because they were (ironically) to scared to change it up. They took the first film, disassembled it and thought ""hmmmm...what can we do to make a fresh sequel?"", to which they then created a brand spanking new story that has less life and cohesion than an idle zombie. Again, it's just a montage of ""funny"" scenes stringed together. The worst part is they actually reused the same jokes, to precision. ""Scream Cheese"", ""I'm Dracula blah blah blahhh"" and the annoying, infuriating and life draining usage of pop music. This time, it wasn't even used properly!? The characters just randomly bust a move to Pitbull! I physically cannot fathom why anyone thinks that's a good idea. The story is incredibly tame, there is no peril. No antagonist until the last five minutes in what I can only describe as an unmemorable fight scene. The constant references to smartphones and apps in an attempt to stay current is embarrassing. It's not all doom and gloom. The animation is still pleasant, voice casting consistently fine and the shared screen time of all the monsters was a requirement that they actually fulfilled. Yes, children will relate and will enjoy this for what it is, so in a sense the film succeeds entertaining its target audience. But us poor adults shouldn't be made to watch drivel like this. Many more intelligent animations out there, watch them instead. Urghhh...got to sit through the third one soon."
" Thumbs up
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,9,"I just saw this (2017), and for a senior citizen (& Vlad fan), I got a kick out of it;so many quotable quotes (was it 'OMSatan' or OMDevil'?; I didn't know which way the plot was going but a great ending; looking forward to 2018 production; nice to have stars doing the rolls; I couldn't tell who was who for sure, so went to IMDb; in the meantime, will see if I can find the first of the series. :-} :-} :-} :-}"
" Too stylized
",2017-10-30 00:00:00,5,"I watched this movie in 3D, which should be an immersive experience.The animations are done very well, the direction or writing is *very* bad. The movie doesn't flow and feels like it pulled apart another animation movie, made their observations into ""rules and laws"" and recomposed it in fragments. So it turns out to be a moza√Øque of something else trying to be something new. It didn't work.The entire movie felt as if they have made a storyboard and had sent these boards slide by slide to the animation department to render the scenes without any transition. And then over-manage the scenes while there isn't any transition. Like a slideshow.Added to this, when two characters interact, the atmosphere is gone. It's usually an empty room, slightly faded in the background. The only moment there is much going on is on the party, but then there is too much chaos to take it all in. While other scene's were rushed in and felt empty. While music felt artificially placed instead of blending away.For example, you have a dialogue character one says something. Expression. second character does a motion and expression in a different scene it seems. Zip back to the first character, says another thing. Slight pauze. Then the other character frowns, in another setting it seems. Back closeup to the first character. It's too, fragmented. And doesn't flow. This movie doesn't flow at all. It's like sitting in an amusementpark ride, and a sensor trips to display a scene of animatronics. The door closes, the animatronics die out. Another opens. Another animatronic.Not even to mention the attempt to put in some stereotypes through voicing. The voicing is so without emotion and so dry. Say line. Stop. Say next line. Stop. The animators on this movie were very wonderful, the others not so much. It was a waste of my time and probably you too."
" Headache-inducing garbage
",2017-05-05 00:00:00,3,"I am only writing this review because of the sheer amount of good reviews that I do not understand. With all respect to the wonderful animators and artists who made this movie at least as visually appealing as it is and the animation is absolutely gorgeous, the writing itself is trash. Most of the characters are one-dimensionally annoying and even a redemption scene didn't manage to make them any more likable. How can you have a movie full of cool monsters and make them into boring cheap ""we-so-hip-and-cool-now"" characters I do not fully understand, but that is exactly what happened here. Honestly, if it weren't for the ever-present emphasis on how much cooler and better the modern culture was and all the dancing and flashing lights, I wouldn't be as harsh on this movie as I am, but god was it irritating to watch. Also, the ending totally ruined any message the movie was trying to convey concerning wee Denis and his humanity. Because hey, it doesn't matter who you are, we love you no matter wha- OH THANK GOD, YOU ARE A VAMPIRE AFTER ALL. To sum up: + great animation and the design is unique enough - story, characters, message of this thing, Dracula (yes, he deserves to be mentioned extra. Loved him in the first movie, profoundly hated him in this one)"
" An unnecessary sequel
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,6,"After the events from the first movie, the two love birds become a couple and have a baby boy which seems to be a human. Dracula is not happy with this aspect so he decides to create a diversion by sending the two in a vacation at his parents'. Meanwhile, with the help of his friends, he is determined to show his grandson the life and pleasures of being a monster, hoping that the little one will understand and somehow grow a pair of vampire fangs.This is, unfortunately, one of those sequels which shouldn't have existed in the first place, sparing us from the curiosity of seeing again the Hotel Transylvania universe. Simply put, the plot is simply lame, lacking any interest or complexity, being there just because it had to have one. The focus is now taken away from the two and moved towards Dracula, in his fixist attempt to prove that his grandson is actually a monster. The whole movie ends with a big battle which is meant to complete the child's race but brings a predictable conclusion which fails to bring something that will somehow rescue the movie from its mediocre state. Yes, it is funny and continues the actions from the original movie, but disappoints from every other aspect, making it a sequel you can easily skip.I honestly hope they won't make a third installment, or at least not in this manner."
" Sign me up!!!
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,1,"My kids want me to see the new sequel (#3) when it comes out. I told them that as long as it has A) a father who can't let go of his daughter, B) an exciting last-minute chase, C) they learn a valuable, maudlin-laced lesson and D) they all sing and dance at the end, and play a pop-song over the credits (oooh, with ""outtakes"" as well), then SIGN ME UP!!! They can use this formula over and OVER again and it will NEVER get old."
