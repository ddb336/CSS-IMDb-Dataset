" Not good
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,3,"Does anybody else find it a bit disingenuous to put together a documentary about the wonderful James Brown without even consulting the surviving members of the JBs? There's a scene in which Maceo Parker gets fined for cursing on the tour bus. Maceo didn't cuss back then, and he doesn't cuss now, so why the was this scene inserted into the movie? Some of these productions are pretty quick not to let pesky facts get in the way of a good story. ""Get on Up"" gets wrong what ""Ray"" got so right, and ultimately plays a great disservice to the legacy of Brown. It's popcorn entertainment , bubblegum media made to be forgotten as soon as it is consumed. It's disrespectful to the story and legacy of James Brown but hey, I'm sure they had fun making it."
" Mr. Dynamite...
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,7,"""Get on Up"" is a Biography - Music movie in which we follow the life of James Brown from his early life of poverty to one of the best musicians of all time. His life was not easy and it consisted of many difficulties and a lot of struggle until success.I have to admit that I did not know the life of James Brown on detail so, this movie learnt me a lot about it and I found his life very interesting. The plot followed his life and his success with plenty of singing and much of emotion. The interpretation of Chadwick Boseman who played as James Brown was simply outstanding and for one more time he succeeded on creating a bond between his character and the audience. Some other interpretations that have also to be mentioned were Dan Aykroyd's who played as Ben Bart, Nelsan Ellis' who played as Bobby Byrd and Viola Davis' who played as Susie Brown. Finally, I have to say that ""Get on Up"" is an interesting biograohy movie about James Brown that I am sure everyone will enjoy and also sing along th movie."
" If Goodfellas was a music biopic, it would be Get on Up.
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,8,"Starts with one of the greatest opening scenes of the 2010s, then never lets up. Funny, powerful, potent, and a bit disjointed, the standard biopic foibles are accompanied by brilliant and soulful filmmaking, and the best performance of Boseman's impressive career. The only thing it's missing is a crochety but good-hearted white man to save him from his own blackness...thank God."
" I would recommend. It had all the ingredients to be grander though
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,7,"Chadwick Boseman is terrific, but 'Get on Up' is missing something that would make it a great biopic.I still very much enjoyed it, I always tend to find biographical films interesting - especially when I don't know too much about the person(s) in question, as is the case with James Brown here; I've always known of him and his major songs, but that's about it.Boseman leads strongly, carrying the film really. That's not to say he's alone in terms of the onscreen talent, as there are others who I liked. Dan Aykroyd is solid, while Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis are welcomed cast members. The brilliant Lennie James is also involved, admittedly in a relatively small role.With all that noted, I just felt there was something missing. I can't exactly pinpoint what that is. One of the things I felt from the start was the lack of likeability I had for the lead character, perhaps that was intentional though. The 'breaking the fourth wall' stuff is iffy, too.The 139 run time probably comes into it as well, while the ageing for Boseman & Co. isn't the best I've seen - which isn't good, given the film opens with a scene that requires ageing so it naturally stuck in my memory more. As also mentioned at the top, I didn't come into this knowing all about James Brown and his music/life so that likely plays a part - though I've seen other biopics under similar circumstances and it hasn't affected my enjoyment.There are still other positives, aside from the cast, of course. I actually liked the non-linear structure of how the story is told, while the cinematography is pleasant. The music is also worked in well.All in all, it's a film that I would recommend. It had all the ingredients to be grander though."
" Funktastic!
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,9,"Chadwick Boseman delivers an amazingly perfect performance as James Brown, who could not have been easy to imitate on any level. James Brown was so unique they shattered the mold, ground up the bits and must have launched them into the stratosphere, because there has not been anyone quite like him ever since.We learn of James' unhealthy relationship with his parents and his upbringing in poverty. His singing was his way out. It was seemingly destined to be, the man had some kind of musical demon within himself that had to express itself. He basically created his own kind of music, James Brown music, no one else had that sound. He grew to legendary status but the movie never shies from showing his flaws along the way. In the end, he was human and made mistakes.The story unfolds in a very non-linear manner, but is easy to follow and actually works well, artistically. I had heard some negative things about this movie, but I enjoyed it quite a lot. It seems like another underappreciated hidden gem to me."
" James Brown Seriously?
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,4,"So I decided to watch this again after the tragic death of Chadwick. Such an amazing actor and human.the Only reason It doesn't get 1 star is because of Chadwick.Now I love James Browns music, who doesn't. However, to have a movie Made about him to idolize him and in a sense Immortalize him along with The greats. Jonny Cash, Ray Charles, Richie Valenz, Freddy Mercury, Elton John etc.
please tell me how they could make a movie about someone who was trash. Meaning not a good person, was full of himself, didn't care who he hurt. Movies should not be made about these types of people.Now you look at Ray, or Jonny Cash, or those who turned life around and become greater then ever. James Brown made his Bed. Thats all I'll say.RIP Chadwick"
" Chadwick Boseman, RIP
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,9,"Since Chadwick Boseman's recent death, I decided to watch ""Get On Up"", having never seen it. Boseman REALLY gets into the role of James Brown, showing him as a masterful singer, a man with numerous personal problems, and an all-around fun guy. I highly recommend the movie."
" Powerhouse
",2020-09-10 00:00:00,10,"What a central performance! A few weeks ago someone asked on Twitter, whom people thought was snubbed at the Academy Awards. Not just not winning an Oscar, but not even being nominated for one. Now my first choice with that always was (and I still feel strong about it), Scarface from the 80s and Al Pacino! He's so amazing in it, I couldn't believe when I read he wasn't even nominated. Now that had other reasons and probably had to do with morals and all that, so maybe understandable. But Chadwick Boseman not even being nominated for playing ... no! BEING James Brown in this? That's an outright scandal! Something I don't understand or comprehend on any level. And I didn't check who was nominated, this is not about any of the other individuals, who are surely fine actors to say the least, but this transformation (mind, body and soul!) he undertook cannot even be fully described in words.Now if like me you missed this in cinemas and not just in light of the recent passing of this great individual, but also amazing actor, I can only highly recommend this. You don't even have to be a super James Brown fan. It's enough if you don't dislike his music. Not judging, we all have different tastes (unless it's racist in nature that you don't like the music, which some probably think of the Oscar snub for the movie overall and individually speaking) - just stating.I may have written a lot, but I have not said much about the biopic yet. This is quite different than most biopics with the exception of the one about Elton John, which broke the fourth wall even more than this does. Chadwick speaks into the camera, to us at times - but it works! The timeline for some may not feel coherent, but a lot of thought went into it and the switching seems almost seemless - it may confuse at first or at times, but you'll get used to it. And while I've praised (or again stated the fact about) Chadwick Bosemans central performance, there is so many more actors involved in this and all bring their A game. Technically sound (no pun intended), with focus on getting as much right about the time and what happened. Which means, you get to see ugly sides of Brown too. He may have been gifted, one of a kind, but he also was flawed ... and the movie does not shy away from that. Incredible overall and not getting the praise it deserves in my humble opinion"
" 2 giants, JB and Chadwick Boseman, will be missed forever
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,10,"James Brown we all know there's nothing to add about a genius who changed the music world forever.
Chadwick Boseman, a giant, an actor with a talent larger than life, went too young too soon...RIP, both"
" A great actor
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,8,"Before his untimely death, I had only seen Chadwick Boseman in a couple of movies -- Black Panther, and Da 5 Bloods. Fine though he was in both, neither role seemed to me overly challenging to an actor of such evident charisma. Yet his acting talent was praised so fervently in the passionate lamentations that followed his passing, thought I'd better investigate his back catalogue. I started with this James Brown biopic.Given the hokey stuff this genre generally turns out, I wasn't expecting much, but GET ON UP avoids many of the pitfalls. For example, the narrative doesn't unfold linearly, the central character is not presented in unquestioningly heroic terms, the script isn't witless and the director clearly knows what he's doing. But above all it has Chadwick Boseman. This really was an acting challenge, and it is impossible to think of anyone else who could have achieved it. What an amazing, breathtaking, staggering performance! It's clear right from the beginning that you're watching a major actor here. By the end, I was heartbroken for the loss of not only this inspired, inspiring performer, but also that of Nelsan Ellis, who plays Brown's best friend with sweet, loving loyalty.For all the film's strengths, there are also substantial weaknesses -- for example, in the hand-me-down female roles. However, the day is saved because they are played by Hollywood royalty, in the persons of Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, who can lift even the most mundane writing into the realm of the real. Fine contributions, too, from Jill Scott, Lennie James, and, as a perfectly believable Little Richard, Brandon Mychal Smith.However, the film belongs to Chadwick Boseman, whose loss we mourn but whose extraordinary gifts and gigantic talent are memorialised here as much as James Brown himself."
" Fantastic movie but
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,6,"The acting in this movie is beyoned superb, not just Chadwick but from everyone. Viola Davis as his mother is heart wrenching and I would have loved to see more of her in this film. Nelsan Ellis performance was also Oscar worthy and it breaks my heart he is another actor gone too soon. James Brown's life is truly an epic story of survival and talent, classic rags to riches. However IMHO that not telling this story in a linear timeline was a disservice to the entire story. Jumping back and forth from childhood to adulthood is pretty standard editing but the confusing part and where I believe the story got lost was jumping around in his career so much. One scene of one song jumps from time period to time period, this I did not understand. I found this non-linear story telling to be difficult to follow and left me trying to piece his sotry together rather than the movie telling me his story. I can't say that all non-linear story telling is difficult to follow sometimes it is done so well however in this instance it did not work."
" read 'The HARDEST WORKING MAN IN SHOW BUSINESS'
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,7,"I watched this last night and really thought they did justice to the music (seamless lip-synching by Chadwick Boseman) with a lot of re-created live performances (Live at the Apollo, Paris, Boston, VietNam) filmed (TAMI Show, Ski Party, Playboy After Dark) and to the complicated man. Not sure about the historical accuracy of band and other politics, but very enjoyable time-shifting bio-pic and another great performance by Boseman. If you're a James Brown fan, you'll enjoy it even more. For a historical context, read 'The HARDEST WORKING MAN IN SHOW BUSINESS' by James Sullivan (which I just read last week)."
" Spectacular James Brown film! I'll definitely miss Chadwick Boseman
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,9,Quite an enjoyable story directed by Tate Taylor that did The Help and MA which both are very good! So sad Chadwick passed away a couple days ago he was such a glorious actor. The music is so damn good with so much joy packed in. I'm surprised Get on Up the didn't get more credit.
" Great movie, Bosemans best role imo
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,10,He did a great impression of him both regularly speaking and singing. He also had his moves down pat.
" Music biopic - keeping it real
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,9,"The acting is great (DAykroyd excluded - PLEASE!!) and the film progresses in sequence to highlight key events in the life and career of JBrown including the good, great and downright ugly. The use of flashbacks is an effective reminder of where JB came from and where he ended up.
Didn't go for look-a-like actors, which never works. Best to act the part and use mannerisms, personal features, quirks etc to tell the story much more effectively. I think the MJagger touch shines through as it's more about the music and what made the man. The track selection is right on the money too."
" Get on Up
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,7,"Get on Up.....So i decided to watch this film for a first time on a day that unfortunetly Chadwick Boseman passed away.And i must say after watching that we have indeed lost a great acting talent that had a great future in front of him.His performance here was brilliant ,his acting as James Brown as oft the charts in every way and he made this film far better then it would be without him.Rest of cast was good also and they had good moments also in it..Songs were also great and Chadwick played them in a great and impressive way.Get on Up is a film that everyone should see,just because of Boseman performances and great songs in it"
" James Brown was great, the movie is not
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,1,"As with many stars, they get a very inflated opinion of themselves. This guy did that and then treated everyone like the were old shoes. Was he really this much of a foul human being? I couldn't ever stand to see this movie again."
" Get on Up
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,5,"I heard about this film during the time of its release, with films about Ray Charles and Johnny Cash proving successful, it made perfect sense to make a film about the life of the ""Godfather of Soul""., directed by Tate Taylor (The Help, The Girl on the Train, Ma). Basically, this is a non-linear narrative telling the story of the rise to fame, personal life and career, and highs and lows of soul singer James Brown (Black Panther's Chadwick Boseman). In the 1938, little James (twins Jamarion and Jordan Scott) lives in poverty in a small home with his parents, mother Susie (Viola Davis) and abusive father Joseph ""Joe"" (Lennie James). Susie leaves Joe, who keeps James and continues to beat him, until Joe joins the army. James is left living with and working for his Aunt Honey (Octavia Spencer), who runs a brothel, though he attends church and enjoys the choir. At 17, James steals a suit and serves a 5-to-13 year sentence, where he meets singer Bobby Byrd (Nelsan Ellis). James joins Bobby, who is impressed by his singing talent, and becomes part of his gospel group, The Famous Flames. Their group perform after up-and-coming singing star Little Richard (Brandon Mychal Smith), who gives James advice on how to make it in the music industry for the ""white devil"". In the 1950s, James and Bobby meet Ralph Bass (Josh Hopkins), an agent for King Records, with whom The Flames record their first single, ""Please, Please, Please"". Executive Syd Nathan (Fred Melamed) isn't interested but changes his mind when he hears James singing. Ben Bart (Dan Aykroyd) becomes James' manager, calling him the group's true voice. The records are labelled ""James Brown and His Famous Flames"". James and Bobby reform the band and perform successfully at the Apollo Theater. James and his band travel to Vietnam to support black troops and are well-received. In 1964, Ben convinces them to let The Rolling Stones close The T.A.M.I. Show, the group end up upstaging the Stones. James has a child, Teddy, with first wife Velma (Jacinte Blankenship), later divorcing her and marrying Dee-Dee (Jill Scott). One night, following a performance, Bobby tells James a lady claiming to be his mother wants to see him. As a young child, James had seen Susie with a soldier, to whom she claimed she didn't know James. Aunt Honey consoled James, saying his mother was foolish and James would become rich. Susie expresses her love for James despite her reluctance to be a mother, he seemingly dismisses her, but after she leaves, he breaks down and tells Bobby to make sure she is cared for. In 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. the audience go crazy, with people trying to get on stage, but James calms the audience. As success grows, James's relationships turn sour. He treats bandmates like lackeys, doesn't allow their creative input, pays them late and makes them work on days off. Eventually, the band members quit, all except for Bobby, until James upsets him also, and shortly after Ben dies of a heart attack. In 1973, James learns Teddy dies in a car accident. In 1988 in Augusta, Georgia, James catches a trespasser in his bathroom, he confronts and forgives the stranger, but accidentally fires a shotgun, killing the trespasser. James is pursued by police, drives through a barricade, sees visions of his parents, and is cornered and arrested. He is eventually released and his career recovers, and his performance of ""Try Me (I Need You)"" moves Bobby in the audience to tears, and everyone else to cheer. Also starring Craig Robinson as Maceo Parker, Tika Sumpter as Yvonne Fair, ""I Need a Dollar"" singer Aloe Blacc as Nafloyd Scott, Nick Eversman as Mick Jagger, and J.D. Evermore as Seminar Presenter. Featuring some of Brown's greatest hits, including ""Get Up Offa That Thing"", ""I Got You (I Feel Good)"", ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"", ""It's a Man's Man's Man's World"", ""Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine"", and ""Super Bad"". Boseman gives an exceptional convincing performance as the legendary singer, from his voice, hairstyles, suits and charismatic and energetic stage performances, and the supporting cast including Ellis, Aykroyd, Davis and Spencer are also very good. It is very annoying that the story is told in a non-consecutive fashion, it may have been much better, but for the leading actor, the recognisable tunes, the glossy and elaborate performance sequences, and some of the interesting hard-hitting true-life material, it is a worthwhile biographical musical drama. Worth watching!"
" Great biography
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,8,"Very well done biography about a troubled person and a genous of music. Chadwick Boseman does a great job in the leading role, in which he is almost not recognizable. I do not need to add that the soundtrack is fantastic, do I?"
" Flawed but entertaining
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,7,"Like other reviewers, I feel that the biggest problem with this movie is that it doesn't flow well. It chops between time periods to such an extent that you feel dizzy. There's not enough of a sense of a coherent narrative. Sometimes it feels more like a series of music videos strung together. However Chadwick Boseman is absolutely perfect as James Brown - he plays him as funny, an excellent showman and a brilliant singer, but also extremely stubborn, ultra eccentric and resilient. The scene as a child when he's boxing show how Brown had to be hard headed, to survive. The production values - costumes, sets, locations - are excellent. They're probably too glossy, but it was a colourful era. There are some really great scenes that do give you insight, like when Brown is performing a polite version of 'I Feel Good' to a room of smiling young white people, and he realises it's absurd, like a clean cut hootenanny. Or the sheer electric energy of when he performs to soldiers at a base in Vietnam who go crazy for him. That's after the plane he arrives on is nearly shot out of the sky. He learns the value of wowing people from an over-the-top religious service he witnesses as a teenager. One of the best scenes is when a young Mick Jagger looks on from the side of a stage in amazement at James's energy, dancing and ability to excite a crowd. In turn, James learns a few tips from over-the-top pianist Little Richard, including the need to be ambitious."
" Just like James Brown: it can't be compared to anything! 9/10
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"This story of The Godfather of funk: James Brown, really hits home with me because the underlying story is that ADHD for ""Mr Brown"" is both his blessing and his curse. His unique style and going with ""What feels good and sounds good"" over proper musical theory ended up revolutionizing the music industry, but at the same time James' energy just couldn't jive with others and he intimidated most everyone. Having ADHD I feel like I have the same strengths and Weaknesses as James and I would go as far as to say without knowing the director Tate Taylor I think he has also faced the same challenges with mental illness, because he did such a beautiful job of putting this in the fine print of the movie without slapping the viewer across the face the way a movie like ""The Joker"" did. The greatest cause of ADHD is emotional trauma as a child, and the entire message of James childhood is that he was abandoned by both his parents.From the get-go I thought Chadwick would probably butcher certain parts of the role, but I started to like his acting more and more as the movie went on. I loved Chadwick as the Black Panther, but seeing the way he methodically became James Brown through his movements and gestures, gives me further appreciation for his physical talent.One other message I felt the director trying to send us is in this ""Mans world"" there's 2 types of men: The ones that BELONG in the front and the ones that BELONG in the back. James only real friend Bobby came to the realization early on that James belongs in the front, and he's his support man, and at the time he says it like James just has the talent that nobody does, and all the fame and attention for the success, but as the movie goes on you start to see the curse of being the man that belongs in the front. Before James found music he got caught but the police stealing a 3-piece suit and went to jail. Petty crime but one that a man who's lost and doesn't know what he's doing would commit. Then later as an older man he seems to be unsure if he's going to retire, but he's not wearing a suit in public anymore he's in a sweatsuit and seems to have lost his purpose without steady performances and ends up in an impromptu high-speed police chase which is certainly excessive for just firing off a gun inside of his own retail shop. What it says is that had James not made it as a successful musician and constantly be able to be in front and perform for people he probably would have had a life of petty-crime because he just would have felt lost and purposeless. It's literally feast or famine to be THE MAN AT THE FRONT. This idea is further backed at the end of the movie when it says ""James continued to tour and perform into his 70's"" meaning he had to keep performing or his life would fall apart and he'd feel dead. I loved this movie and the great motivational quotes sprinkled in throughout: 9/10"
" James and His Flames Deserved Better
",2020-01-10 00:00:00,7,"Just watched ""Get On Up."" I thought it fluctuated from serious drama to camp too often, especially with the talking into the camera. What for? I wasn't feeling it, especially with no references to Fred Wesley or Bernie Worrell, key architects of the James Brown sound, and little acknowledgement of Pee Wee Ellis. Bobby Byrd came off as a sycophant rather than an equally talented cohort. There was no reference to the potency of ""I'm Black and I'm Proud"" and only brief mention of his struggles between his conservative views and being considered by the more militant brothers in the movement as ab Uncle Tom. All this despite songs like ""I Don't Want Nobody to Give Me Nothing,"" ""King Heroin"" and ""Don 't Be A Dropout."" In short, the Mick Jagger produced ""Mr. Dynamite: The Rise of James Brown"" (a documentary) got it right *as it should have). Oddly enough this film was also produced by Jagger. The music scenes in GOU were kicking and Viola Davis, as always, kicked ass, Chadwick Boseman was limited by a limp script. Overall I give it a C."
" The thrill is gone.
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,2,"James Brown's music brings joy to people, Get on Up brings little of that, in fact it's a bit of a chore.Boseman's portrayal's okay, though somewhat straight forward and watered down for Brown, lacking likableness and oomph. The Bobby Byrd character's poorly acted and a waste of time. There's too much racial divide and significance in the film, just enjoy the damn music. Out here trying to win an Oscar or something, instead of cherishing the great man's contribution to the world. Also, how could they not put ""The Boss"" in it..."
" Ok but not good!
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,3,I loved the performances and the direction was ok but this movie was missing something! I think it was the writing which sucked!
" DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT?
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,8,"Disclaimer: I live in the Augusta area. I know a band that James Brown ""robbed"" members from. I am also acquainted with one of his off spring and the town of Elko, SC where he was born. Basically none of them want anything to do with him. This film shows the ""likeable"" James Brown.The production opens with a series of flashbacks and time warps and eventually settles on a chronological tale. It starts with Brown's miserable childhood, working for a brothel, his early arrest and being ""discovered"" by Little Richard from Macon. The film touches on his women beating, troubles with drugs, difficult boss, run-in with the law, and basically being a disagreeable person who knows exactly what he wants down to the iota details.People who are close to James Brown agree that Chadwick Boseman nailed it, especially the on stage performance.Parental Guidance: About 2 f-bombs (No one says FU to James Brown.) Brief sex. No nudity. Brown slaps a woman off screen.PLOT SPOILERS/Other local stuff: In the film it shows James Brown slapping his wife for showing too much cleavage. She didn't stop showing cleavage and spent a lot of time at the cosmetic counter buying make-up to cover her bruises. When James Brown's mother got old, he moved her into a nursing home in South Carolina. He would go visit her after church every Sunday. He attended church in Elko and his childhood shack was located behind the church, although the Elko folks claim he wasn't born there as claimed on Wikipedia, but in nearby Snelling. His style of singing did not bode well in church and caused people to cringe as his voice echoed from the rear of the church.Waitress's do not remember Mr. Brown fondly as he demanded perfection in his food and would sometimes take it upon himself to show the cook how to prepare a dish. Mr. Brown would frequently attend the ball games of his grandson. The locals knew who he was and respected his privacy at the games. He would sign autographs when asked, which was infrequent."
" Definitely not for everyone
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,1,Very strange movie... Unfortunately I wanted to find out more about this artist.. But after 25 mins Get it up from my bed and turn off video.
" Underrated.
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,10,"Great casting, great screenplay, great hommage to the godfather of soul come on people Mick Jagger produced this movie you gonna give him that score too when he's gone and there a movie of his life?
Enjoyed every minute of this wonderfull movie!"
" James Brown
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because it brings the James Brown to world's attention in a way that has never really been done before. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" A real production
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,8,"You feel the spirit of James Brown. A sad childhood that didn't stop his destiny. Great acting, thought of Bruno Mars, then discovered that James Brown was a great influence on Bruno Mars. Enjoyed the movie."
" Excellent Acting by Chadwick
",2017-09-04 00:00:00,10,"Chadwick Boseman's acting, in my opinion, was excellent. I really, really, can't believe or understand why he and this movie didn't win an Academy Award. Maybe because I tend to lean more toward natural and believable acting roles than those of generally expected, predictable roles. All the actors were so good and I just watched it again on TV (CTRC) and still enjoyed it as if I was watching it for the first time. That's when you know a movie is good...that's the measuring tool. Plus James Brown's life was an interesting one, no doubt. He rose through the ashes and made something of himself, almost as if, it was just plain destiny. Even though he was treated so bad as a child, it made him the man he became and nobody can take that away...nobody."
" This is it. Best biopic ever.
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,8,"This is Boseman's best so far. I saw Message From The King like a week ago and this is far better since the role demands more and Boseman pretty much nailed it. Every role is cast perfectly. Something I can seldomly say about most movies. Especially Nelsan Ellis as Bobby Byrd and Craig Robinson as Maceo Parker are worthy mentions. Yeah, JB did drugs, beat women and probably even worse, but I had the pleasure of seeing him perform in Vienna a year and a half before he died, and I gotta admit, even though the guy was about 70, he still had it. The audience wasn't worthy of a JB, the Godfather Of Soul, Mr. Dynamite, Mr. Funk, since there were only about a 1000 people in a venue where 3000 would fit. JB represents something most people from my generation can't even comprehend. I'm not sure I fully understand it. A shiny figure from a past era, when being a musician, entertainer had a slightly different tone to it, a different meaning maybe even.This movie is very much entertaining, like the man himself and if even half of it is true in some way or another, this definitely deserves a good rating 7.5/10"
" What could have been.
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,5,"Just want to start by saying that this really is a terrific picture. Well shot, well made, tells the Brown story to a T all the greatest hits and lowest points of his life. This film does feature a fatal flaw however. It is edited in the poorest of fashion. The way it jumps all about from year to year blows throw the point of being a distraction to being something that both detracts from and ruins an otherwise terrific movie. Classic case of someone being too clever for their own good. ""Ray"" and ""Walk the Line"" tell (for the most part) an in order, hit by hit tale of their subjects careers, with some flashback sequences. So this movie trying to do something different makes sense in that they are trying to separate themselves from ""normal"" music biopics. In doing so, they really failed everyone they were working with and I can't believe no one stepped in to make a more coherent movie of this great material and subject matter.If they ever come along with a ""chronological"" cut of this movie, I will happily give it 9 stars, and stop my day to check it out. As is, 5 and a hard but fair 5 for some of the worst editing of what could have been great movie that we will ever see."
" Great movie on the Godfather of Soul
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,8,"A movie on the great James Brown, the Godfather of Soul and one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. We see his life, from boyhood, to initial steps as an entertainer, to success and later life.Great biopic. Directed by Tate Taylor, who directed The Help, and starring Chadwick Boseman (who played Jackie Robinson in 42) as James Brown, this is an entertaining, absorbing look into the life of one of the greatest stars of the 20th century, a man who created a genre of music (funk) and influenced several others.Excellent performance by Chadwick Boseman in the lead role. Very convincing, capturing incredibly well the energy, swagger and determination of James Brown, plus his on-stage theatrics. The film's hairstylist and make-up artist deserve heaps of credit too, considering the (quite accurate) transformations they put Boseman through.Part of what makes the movie so great is the music, and the live performances to go with it. Very well done.Not perfect though. Starts pretty disjointedly and non-engagingly. Takes a while to get into the movie (but once you do it is a great journey). Even once it does get going, there is still a degree of roughness around the edges. Tate Taylor seems to paint with broad brushes, as the smaller detail sometimes seems overlooked or bent for dramatic purposes.Comparisons with Ray and Walk The Line are in order, and Get On Up is not quite up to the standard of those two movies, largely for the reasons mentioned above.This all said, a great movie."
" Very Good Movie about a Soul Legend
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Chadwick Boseman is great as James Brown. He captures the man at the various stages of his life and career which cannot be easy to do. Many remember James Brown as he was when THEY saw him, but this movie captures JB when he looked and acted very differently. Check out YouTube videos of the young JB and you see how well Chadwick Boseman did.it cannot be easy to capture one of the greatest Soul/Funk performers of all time, especially the dancing but Mr Boseman gets it spot on.It was also good to see James early life and how his childhood shaped the man he was to become. Also the movie does not gloss over the less than nice man JB could be.Good movie this."
