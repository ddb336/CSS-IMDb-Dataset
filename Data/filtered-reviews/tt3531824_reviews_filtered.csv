" deadly games
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,5,"In 2016, when they made 'Nerve', Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman already had in their joint filmography the series 3 and 4 of the horror cycle 'Paranormal Activity' as well as 'Catfish', a successful documentary that deals with romantic relationships online and their dangers. 'Nerve' is a combination of these two genres and more, adding elements of teenage romance and cruel 'truth or dare' reality games like. It is the style of movies that can be watched simply for relaxation, especially by fans of one of these genres, or that can also be viewed as a warning about the capture of public and private space by social networks that turn the Internet from a medium of communication in an alternative space that monopolizes and controls the whole life. This hybrid combination works at times unexpectedly well in 'Nerve'.The film begins as a story about college students searching for a path in life and especially for themselves. They are all connected to the magical space of the Internet, both for entertainment and because a large part of their social life takes place there. The main heroine - a girl named Vee - connects - in response to a friend's challenge - to a network game called Nerve which divides the world into 'players' and 'watchers'. 'Players' accept challenges, 'Watchers' follow them everywhere, bet on them and reward those who fulfill their missions, which become more and more dangerous. Within hours, the game absorbs Vee, who not only crosses the virtual border between 'watchers' and 'players' but also the physical boundary - whose crossing is forbidden by her mother's family discipline - between the suburbs of Staten Island and Manhattan, being absorbed by the game and by the great metropolis that become areas of danger as stakes and rewards in the game increase.Like many other genre films, 'Nerve' skillfully uses visual elements borrowed from digital game graphics, giving viewers the immersive feeling that they are watching such a game. Emma Roberts who plays the role of Vee and Dave Franco, in the role of partner, adversary, and inevitably, of her romantic interest, are both well cast and play their roles with charm and personality. The story is quite interesting for a good part of the film, except maybe for the final part which surprises precisely by the lack of the inventiveness that characterised the rest of the film. How should we relate to movies like 'Nerve'? Should we take them seriously or treat them as pure entertainment movies that only use the format? It ultimately depends on each of the spectators. 12 years after 'Catfish' and 5 years after 'Nerve' were made it can be said that the presence of social networks in our lives has only increased, the use and benefits they bring have become more visible, but the dangers also have become more obvious. After all, on the Internet and social media, as well as in the conventions of this kind of movies, the answers depend on us. 'Watchers' or 'Players'?"
" Short enough to not get my nerves
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,5,"To make this clear from the start: Nerve is never logical, never close to reality and should not be dissected to the details. But it works as a mindless entertainer for a good one and a half hour.
It all gets started with a view into the life of normal high school girl Vee and her friends. Her best friend encounters the new real-life online game Nerve, where you can choose to become player or watcher. Soon she convinces Vee to register as a player too. What begins as a distraction from her ordinary school life quickly turns into a night full of spectacular action and completely dumb decisions at the point when she meets the mysterious Ian.
From there on her actions, resulting of the dares she receives by the watchers of the game, become more and more perilous as hilarious. Nerve creates an utterly sensation-seeking society to speed the audience through a series of pointless events and forgettable characters. Nonetheless, it knows to entertain when just taken as it is: a bright, fast-paced movie about a game, that could never exist but at the same time feels realistic enough to be believable. At least as long as you don't think about it further.
Do not get me wrong here, it all works as a popcorn and beer entertainment, but never sustain any logical review of the happenings. Consequentially, all upcoming attempts to really criticise society or the internet culture are smothered right away. As there is neither any character built-up nor a real antagonist, the movie left me completely indifferent and incurious.
I would recommend it as a movie with friends and booze, when the dialogues are not properly followed anyway and the fast pace and bright colours do their job."
" Cinematography is strong on this one
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,7,"Unfortunately the last third of the movie lacks of logic and the characters start to become incomprehensible. The finale is way over the top and inconsequent. I wish the movie would have taken a more realistic direction, because it had the possibility to be great. Like this it was still better than I expected."
" True or Dare in high tech.. but something is missing!
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,5,"At first, it may seem to be a good idea or good plot. I could understand if the player wants to make money, watchers have to join, pay and dare. However, there are lot of things don't make sense.* spoiler alerts! *1. How could this game owned by nobody? and no server? what did they shut down at the end? If so, who benefits. It is not realistic that watchers play to watch and yet there is no middle man to control or benefit. Someone had to create the game to benefit.2. Who is doing all those drone flying, light setting (in the last scene)? They just don't come out without anyone behind it3. How harmful is it? I could understand you could win if you pass the dare. But if you don't, you just fail, no one is putting a gun on your say you have to continue. (yes there is gun in the end, but that is again not controlled by anyone). And the part of being a prisoner also does not make sense at all!4. The scene about the main characters being displayed in the party TV like a drama scene. Who is talking video?5. many goofs you can see from the pageIf there is a middle man in the movie, that can explain everything. To me, this is illogical. The beginning of the movie started out great, but empty in the middle. At the end, the twist is not that bad, but again it could be better if middle man is involved (like hungry game or running man)"
" This movie... Not a single boring second
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,9,"It's your teenage slash hightech 21 century movie but hey, it's exciting, it's well filmed, and the actors have done a great job. It's a bit of Unfriended: dark web and a bit of something else. And the best, or worst is, that this could totally happen."
" So close, yet so far
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,3,"This film had an interesting concept but every time it felt like it was coming towards a thrilling plot-point, it just flew past it and missed the mark by an absolute mile. That said, it's clearly for a teenage audience so it does make for a palatable version of this concept for them. Charlie Brooker would have done an excellent job at a darker and more adult version."
" This Challenges the Ethics of Us the Audience
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,7,"My memory of it is vague and I feel it was around 2000. A film was made that included a scene where 3 college kids (I think) did a dare to lie down along the white line of a road as traffic went past. This scene was replicated in real life and some kids died. Again my memory is hazy but I seem to recall the movie makers removed the scene after this event (it may have been put back in later).So...should a movie like Nerve exist???I honestly don't know. I am no longer a stupid teen lol so its harder for me to judge its impact on that age group but when you look at the dumb things people do for a selfie???The movie itself, I actually really enjoyed it. The cast were great and although it did/does have its level of predictability, the story was interesting and fun to watch.My general view (for anyone who cares lol) is that movies are movies first and foremost and the audience has to take responsibility. However its an interesting thing to consider :)"
" Definitely Recommend
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,8,"In my opinion this film was great, very nerve wracking at times. I loved it to be honest. I would watch this film again. Definitely Recommend watching."
" Had me biting my lips
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,10,Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Made me laugh a couple of times. Couldn't have been any better. Not sure why the bad reviews are really low because I thought the concept of the film was good and exciting. Loved the actors in this. My favourite Dave Franco film ever!! The haters must have woken up on the wrong side of the bed!!
" GREAT CONCEPT, EMPTY END
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,5,"The story idea is great, it could have been darker, more of a high intensity thriller than a drama. The acting was great and the filming of it was pretty but not creative or interesting. The ending is a massive disappointment, it's like the needed to round it up quickly. Could of added a dark twist that keeps you on edge. A shame !"
" Not a bad one time watch
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,6,"Even tough in many ways this film really got on my nerves),i didn't switch it off and watch to the end,which in my book means that it is not so bad)"
" Nerve of steel
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,6,"Emma roberts and Dave franco were really good in this, very tense scenes, and the third act was interesting.I didn't know that much going in"
" Fun to watch!
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,10,This movie film is very aesthetically pleasing. Exciting and fun to watch. Awesome cast.
" A Sci-Fi, Action Flick with an Interesting Message
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,8,"So, I'm not going to say that the movie overall was great. It was over the top, for sure. And there were plenty of parts that strain credulity. But I liked the main characters, it was action packed throughout and there was certainly a climactic ending.But what I really appreciated about the movie was how it called out general anonymity on the Internet. People will do, say or condone other people doing terrible things when they're behind an anonymous handle.Is there a place for being anonymous? Yeah, sure. People who are oppressed for political, religious, ethnic or other reasons. But the Internet -- and social media in particular (Twitter, I'm looking at you) -- almost encourage people to act in horrible ways toward each other. People seem to think it gives them a license to say and do things that they wouldn't normally say or do if they were in person or undisguised.Social media is the real plague."
" My nerves were on edge
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,10,"The film is very thrilling, intense, and surprisingly well made with good performance from the two leads."
" Boring
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,2,"Rarely smth more boring.Miles looks like a 10 yr. old wanna-pee-baby.Emma is good, that's the 2 stars for."
" A Huge disappointment
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,1,"First of all i want to thank the Lord that I didnt pay to watch this.
The trailer is at least watchable and 30 seconds of this movie is too much for my eyes. It is such lazy writitng with such a great potential to tell us a story and wartn us about the dangers of the internet. Yet it doesnt fail to disappoint in ecvery aspect of cinema. Classic teengae girl, no life, fake friends (except for that one guy who is apparently the greatest hacker in the world and just deletes the game with a little help of his ping pong enthusiasts), unrealistic parent, dead brother( btw he is dead just so we could feel sorry for her and it gets mentioned for like 30 seconds so again lazy character dev.). So she decides to take on an advanture that can literally be stopped at any time in the movie with submitting the photographic evidence to the police and ending the game immediately. And then this little girl who is not 18 yet btw outsmarts the whole hacker team behind the game and orchestrates a fantastic plan in a matter of seconds to stop the game just so we could get a plot twist at the end which is again like the whole movie disappointing
I hated it
1/10"
" Great movie with a chilling message to the humans
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,9,"I gave an high rate, first, because I loved the movie itselft for how it has been conceived. The idea is great, with the fast camera action, sudden change of scenes that help to keep the rhythm of the narration high and gripping (i was never bored one second).
But mainly what is great in this movie is the message itself that brings in: who really give powers to the social networks? And to the most creepy ones part of the deep web which can endanger our lives? Who is the main responsible, in the end? But of course. Oursevelves as users and us public.
The end of the movie gives a good message: we can still act on time if we are able to understand the subtle line that distinguish ""fun"" with ""fall into a unhealthy trap"" that those online social games put: maybe the key is to be able to act on time. We simply have to learn how to ""handle with care"" social network and online interactive games.
Once the game is ended and its life too, at the end of the movie, i had a double feeling: happy to know this but sad to realized that another horrible scenario like this will surely reborn soon unless we change our attitude towards them.
We can make it."
" Stupid movie
",2020-09-25 00:00:00,1,One of the most stupid movies I have ever watched.
" This is one of my favorite movies
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,10,"I love how they go to the dark web with nerve and no one can even get out unless you bail or fail. The concept is awesome. I can't stand Emma Roberts but she did good playing the awkward teenager who can't get a bf but is smart. James Franco character was great and he's of course gorgeous and I love Sydney a lot also. I felt her character made the movie interesting. I never got bored once and I love watching all the dares! I felt this was a really good movie that was underrated! I like how this game is on the dark web and not controlled by one crazy villain, but just kids who want to be entertained. I love the crazy hackers that shut down the game in the end. I just got confused how Sydney was able to call Machine Gun Kelly, when I phone dropped and was smashed. I don't know anyone's number without my phone, especially a person I just met. Other than that, I felt this movie was great and interesting and no too full of technology. But based on a girl who was turned down by a guy she loves and then snaps and wants a change! The fact the game can take over your whole life and bank account if you snitch. Is crazy but if you actually watch the movie it make senses and explains it all. I like Sydney and Vee as best friends because that is all girls in high school. You compete with each other but love each other at the same time. I like machine gun Kelly in this a lot too. His character makes you scared of him at first and then like him later on. He's not bad actor. None of these actors were bad at all. Just couldn't stand looking at Emma Roberts extensions. They could have gave her better extensions in the movie. I could tell right away it was fake. But that doesn't make a movie! I even like the soundtrack in this movie. The mother annoyed me alittle, I didn't think she needed to be so much into this because I just wanted to watch the younger actors. But I guess you have to have a mother that worries in a high school movie. I just loved the premises of this movie, the actors, the whole plot and even the ending didn't piss me off. It's a good movie. People who give it bad reviews either don't understand the dark web or didn't actually watch the movie and listen to what people said. Like I said I watched this a million times so I understand it a lot. I'll keep on watching it."
" Simply lousy
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,2,"The main idea was interesting but the way it was implemented was terrible. This movie was simply a neon cyberpunk aesthetic. The characters only fit in very obvious unoriginal archetypes. The naive girl, the popular girl who is gonna lose her popularity, prince charming, bad guys who are secretly good, and the genius hackerman. The only decent thing about it was how how the main character Vee eased into this whole dangerous life. Like she was clearly much more uncomfortable in the beginning.
The plot didn't really go by smoothly. It was shifted from stage to stage very sloppily. Especially in the final plot points.
The cybersecurity/tech side of the movie was also very inaccurate. But then of course, the majority of the audience aren't familiar with cybersecurity on a technical level but the concepts weren't simplified well at all. They were simply wrong and inaccurate. Another example of misusing science in movies. (Just like quantum in other movies.)
Long story short, the only reason I fully watched this movie was because I was watching it with friends. And if you've seen the trailer, you don't even need to watch the movie."
" I was surprised good movie
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,7,"My hope was not up , it good entertaining movie. You kinda miss this kind of movies that didn't focus"
" Idea is not original. Just a newly Devour
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,6,"If you watched Devour back in 2005 then here's the remake of it. Also, pretty much like the very well known Blue Whale game. Actors are fine but the idea is way too stretched and unreasonable.
Could've been better."
" Worth it!
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,8,"Nerve is fantastic! It conveys a wonderful message about the internet and our world today, giving new insight on this particular subject matter, with great leads and amazing music.
The coloring in this movie is breathtaking as is the directing. Every shot is great and holds many elements. And the music fits well within each scene.
The plot is interesting and surprised me with each dare they got. Emma Roberts and Dave Franco did a wonderful job as two teens stuck in the game with no way out.
Overall, it's worth the watch and can hopefully get it's lesson across."
" Brilliant concept but no backbone
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,6,"The backbone of a film is always the characters, in this film, apart from the two or three lead protagonist, no others were introduced on the scale to connect with. Plot is good, social media attention, showing insecurities between friends, twist at the end is huge. I just kinda fed up of watching good guys hacking into bad guys at the end moment and won boom! What I'm trying to express is that the concept had the potential of taking this movie to the ultimate peak but it's ended too quickly and simply.(plot discussions) If the creators of the game were capable of hacking into everyone's server and mess up with everything, if they were able to have command in such high authority, how can they be dumb at the final moment of the movie?
Anyways it's certainly fun to watch with friends and have a good time."
" Great Fun Movie 🏬
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,8,It was Great Fun and Exciting Throughout. The Ending was Good Too.
" A nice format change - loses it at the end
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,7,"The lead character gets sucked into an on-line game of Truth or Dare but with huge cash rewards and no option of truth.This has been done before in several horror movies and rarely works that well.The main issue with this format is the escalation of the dares to create sufficiently horrific scenes.
So the dares go from
1 -kiss your class mate
2- flash you knickers on the bus
3 -murder your neighbours with an axe.As this film is more of a thriller than a horror it doesn't have to go all out on the dares and it makes a big difference in a positive way.
Instead time is well spent building the characters.
This means when someone is going to be expelled or arrested you actually care, because you understand what this means to the character.The acting and production is all good (considering the budget) and there are moments of genuine tensions.I really enjoyed this for a Netflix movie.For the most the film is kind of realistic until the end.
Then things get a bit fluffy.
It feels like the writers set out to make a good honest thriller but felt pressured to tack on some commentary about social media.
The story does this all on its own quite adequately so when the cringey speech about cyber-bullying comes along it feels far too on-the-nose.
The technology element gets a bit out of hand too."
" I liked it
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,7,"I thought this was a good film overall. Likeable characters, a plot which hooked me in and a good amount of action combined to make this a pretty good watch. The ending I thought was a nice twist as well.My issue I had was that it never fully explained the rules at any point, especially of certain tasks. When you had to cross a building with a ladder. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO STAND? Nowhere does it say this.
Vee (Emma Roberts) had a female friend called Sydney who was far too annoying for my liking as well.
I fail to believe that this many people would pay £20 to watch it for a day as well. It's practically the entirety of New York.I feel like I'm nit picking but it's just little things that annoyed me. Overall though, I think it's a decent watch."
" Younger Guns Akimbo
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,7,"REVIEW - NERVEPhone apps are everywhere and can do a lot of things but the question is will there one day be an interactive app whereby you can dare someone to do something? I'd guess that the answer is yes, but what would happen?We saw this premise recently with Guns Akimbo and actually watching this film I suddenly realised that Guns Akimbo is very similar to this film, however in its own way even though both are similar they both hold up as enjoyable films.One film to simply turn your brain off, watch and enjoy it for what it is, a teen version of Guns Akimbo.Rating 7 out of 10"
" I think teenagers will like this
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,5,"You dont have to think much here... Its for young people who is multitasking anyway.... Not that its a bad thing. Its just how it is today.
Emma Roberts keeps the movie alive because she is absolutely stunning to look at ;-)
Dont think to much about it.... Then you will find it stupid.
Just watch and enjoy the entertainment."
" MUST WATCHHHHHHHHHHHHH
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,10,THIS MOVIE WILL GIVE YOU THE BEST BEST NEW YORK CITY VIBES. Make sure u watch it at night with dim lights on. The soundtracks are so amazing.
" Watcher or a Player?
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,10,"Nerve is a 2016 American techno-thriller adventure film directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman and written by Jessica Sharzer, based on the 2012 novel of the same name by Jeanne Ryan. The film stars Emma Roberts, Dave Franco and Juliette Lewis, and revolves around an online objective truth or dare video game, which allows people to enlist as ""players"" or ""watchers"" as the game intensifies.I love this film! it'a a fast-paced ride and has some great intense moments, a great soundtrack and Dave Franco and Emma Roberts have great chemistry as the two leads, I hope they make another!"
" Breathtaking
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,9,Sci fi thriller that takes you to places you've never been and mirrors the contemporary cultural trends.
" Garbage
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,1,"If this is how Hollywood views millennials in the social media age, they have no idea what they're talking about. Garbage acting, script, editing, cinematography, and this is before mentioning how poorly the movie describes the film concept. Who was filming them at the carousel again? How did the FBI not question someone's bank account just randomly losing $10k?"
" Good plot, great tension
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,7,"First of all, the idea of Nerve is quite original and engaging. It is fitting to our reality, and seems similar to those kind of dark urban games teenagers play nowadays (I'm not an old bitter 40-year-old, I swear!).
The 'dares' the characters go through are great for the plot, filled with suspense and written/filmed in a way that really had me on the edge of my seat. The dares escalate, starting off soft but going up like a movie should, which is also nice.The character could be a little more solid, with clearer motivations, but this doesn't affect too much because of the kind of movie this is. The film takes a little turn towards the third act, changing from an urban game to something much bigger. I'm not sure if I liked this or not, but it was mostly well-written either way. I did not like the revelation that Ty turns out to be good. The reason is, I feel more foreshadowing was needed. There was never any clue about him even considering turning good. It could not have been predicted, therefore it is improvable. Yes, Emma Robert's character's friend did call him and that made sense, but I feel even more clues were needed for it to work.Either way, the movie is very good, I'd say about the average. I definitely recommend it."
" Can Be Entertaining!
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,7,"Nerve pretty enjoyable ride with a amateurish movie, it's PG-13 so more of a fun, it's centred on a good concept that catches the viewers attention, fast and short to watch, internet can be dangerous now days with teenager's why not! If money is the thing that everyone likes, get ready for some good stunts, so good to see (Dave Franco) in it he is one of the growing characters out there i would like to see him more for upcoming movies, grossed well too and a work of success out there, highly recommended if you are the one who likes to see game shows, 6.5/10⭐"
" Teen flick
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,2,"If you've watched the trailer, your probably curious. Let me save you the time. This is a teen movie. PG13 so there is no real thrills. The scenes that make it PG13 have no impact on the movie. The cast are boring, the plot holds promise but it's poorly delivered and because of the low age rating the film goes nowhere. The trailer shows the only action within the film. It has nothing that a fan of action, thriller, horror or slasher would be interested in. Its about teens saying ""omg"" alot with corny pop music played over it."
" Loved it
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,10,"No issues with the movie here, loved the characters, the music, the idea and even the romance story in it. Watched it 2 nights in a row to show my husband it and wasn't disappointed the second time."
" good concept
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,6,This movie had a good concept and was executed really well but it fell flat when watching the movie I found that every dare they had to do was reveled in the trailer. They even reveled the ending.
" nerve
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,5,"I really like this movie. Interesting exciting plot and picture in neon colors. The main heroes are real daredevils. Are they not afraid that some application has collected all their personal information? I would not trust my data to such an application. Therefore, I use Utopia p2p."
" A movie with a really good message
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,8,"I love realistic movies that make you think and this movie was one of them. As soon as people are not anon anymore, they are afraid to speak- why? The game in the movie might be over but it is not in our every day life. We have access to social medias and other online platforms where we can be our true selves that are not even us in our close friends' and family's eyes. That being said, the dilemma is that sometimes we are not ourselves because we care too much about what other people would think (though irrelevant to the message this movie is trying to deliver). In that sense, this movie accurately depicted a small piece of the life we are living in. People may find this movie scary and freaky, but it is our real world we are all living in right now."
" The Dicey Social Media Game of Truth or Dare
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,7,"In the exciting thriller Nerve, teens turn New York into a stage for showing off the dares they accept from the newly addicting game called Nerve. In this game, you either pay to be a watcher or get paid to be a player. When shy wallflower Vee (Emma Roberts) decides to be a player in the game, she ends up meeting Ian (Dave Franco) to play the social media-driven truth and dare game without the truth. Nerve was nominated for people's choice awards in 2017 for favorite thriller movies, along with an 85.2 million grossed total. The new game drags Vee and Ian all across the streets of New York at all hours of the day, and sometimes into very risky situations. This movie will keep you on the edge of the seat and the wondrous soundtrack will bring a smile to your face.
Vee is a Statin Island high schooler who recently got accepted into her dream school, but the death of her Wu-Tang Clan-loving brother makes this choice more difficult, as her mom wants her to stay at home. Vee recently got shut down by her crush and is persuaded by her Wild best friend Sydne (Emily Meade) to try this new game that all the craze is about. This high-risk game of truth and dare led to her kissing a stranger in a diner for $100, this stranger happens to be Ian. The rest of the night Vee continues to complete dares for money, but all the viewers want Vee to be with Ian and do dare with him. At first, the dares are just fun challenges but later on, they get more demanding and dangerous. Soon the movie explains the dark side of the game and how it's controlled by people on the dark web and once you start you can never quite unless you win. This is similar to the movie Catfish directed by Schulmanas well, both films hint at the danger one can do when behind a screen.
The intense scene where Vee and Ian accept a dare to go 60 blindfolded on a motorcycle, is a nail-biting situation similar to the James Bond movie Skyfall The fast car and motorcycle chases in James Bond make the audience embark on the same fierce and edgy emotional journey. When Vee (Emma Roberts) is very nervous and shaky at the beginning of the scene, you can see her go through changes and transition into a bold cutthroat stuntman. Ian (Dave Franco) is forced to put all his total trust with Vee, their acting tremendously helped create the right tense atmosphere for this scene. These actors also made the characters connect on an emotional level to the film and Vee and Ian. I won't say any spoilers but at the end of the film, the audience is so invested into the characters your palms will be sweating.
Equally Important, this movie soundtrack that will make you want to get up out of your seat and dance around. The ""electric"" song electric love by Borns, adds to the film an enjoyment factor. This music gets your heart pumping, and adds realism to the movie because during an exciting time in your life energetic music should be playing for the audience to get a deeper connection to the film. The audience for this film is mostly teenagers and the upbeat and popular songs appeal perfectly to that age group. The directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman add an interesting component of Vee's dead brother loving the rap group Wu-Tang Clan, so they add lots of Wu-Tang songs which are popular with teens. One recommendation I would give the directors is to choose a direction they want their movie to go in and stick to it, its part high school cliches, part love story, and part cybersecurity similar to the movie Anon directed by Andrew Niccol.
Despite the one negative aspect, this movie is sure to be very intriguing and scores a perfect score for entertainment value. Nerve will hold your attention for the entire 96 minutes. The cinematography by Michael Simmonds adds bright neon lights, stereotypical New York City lights, and excitement. Although this movie isn't in theaters anymore be sure to pop some popcorn at home catch this film on Amazon Prime, YouTube, or iTunes, because this is one you won't want to miss."
" Really Good Film
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed Nerve. It had a really unique storyline and I was instantly hooked. It was very exciting and often had my heart beating very fast! Vee and Ian were a great pairing and I loved their scenes. The only let down in my opinion was the ending as I feel it was rushed. 8/10, give it a watch!"
" I was entertained, but....
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,6,"20 mins into this, I loved it - I was all in for the ride, then, you know, that la dee da, bulls*** ending happened. I really wish they'd gone dark with that ending.
Actually, every moment after Vee snitches to that cop should be changed, I feel like up until that point it was so good.
I was still entertained, but the magical hacker network taking down everything... in record time, uuugh, it was so, typical.
Also, Vee's brother, he played Nerve, right? That's how he died?? lol, I can't've been the only one that thought that - why mention him at all, why even have a brother, if he's not central to the story or some breakthrough??
Him being ""the fun was"" can't've been it, can it?This movie was good, almost great. Strong 6/10."
" Excellent
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,10,"I believe this movie got my attn from very start due to its pace, story and acting. Truely, one of the best movies I have seen this year. The story kept me watching till its end and the story was believable. I RECOMMEND"
" Really liked this movie
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,10,I wasn't sure if I would like this movie or not but I really like Emma Roberts and Dave Franco and they really worked well together in this movie. Loved this movie start to finish. I remember playing truth and dare at school and it was nothing like this lol
" Don't stay in the story, pay attention to the background
",2019-11-29 00:00:00,8,"For a generation in which being exposed is the most natural thing in the world, this film invites reflection on the consequences of addiction to social networks, particularly public approval. The film is a huge contribution in putting this issue in the debate."
" Nice ""Black Mirror-esq"" film
",2019-11-25 00:00:00,7,"I do like some semi realistic tech dystopia, so this was a pretty decent film. Solid acting from an up and coming Netflix cast, and an interesting plot. The motorbike scene was ridiculous though, that bike could do 60 in about 4 seconds, no need to take 10 minutes!"
" A pleasant suprise
",2019-11-20 00:00:00,8,"I quite enjoyed the visuals style and cinematography, it was suspenseful but not to graphic. It's nice to watch a movie sometimes that isnt jam packed with violence
Over all a fun movie.
Worth a watch."
" Good concept poor film
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,3,"If you consider the concept only, it could have been a decent film, if it were more along the lines of the manga, Dead Tube, it could have further potential. With the first act, it seemed to be okay, if you ignore the poor aspects the overall set up is good, when the moral matters are brought up the message is overly played, really pushing a message, whereas if you took the concept to Dead Tube, you could have a successful message if not so on the nose, a message played through the events and what is seen rather than the ending that is given. Much of the overall film feels as though something exciting is about to happen but is unfortunately lost to draw in viewers to the the message the film and studio try to push. It is unfortunate this is a missed opportunity, the cast were also an issue in that they were selected for attracting a younger audience. If we had unknown actors, with a darker plot we could be left with something that makes the viewer consider what they have witnessed compared to the message that is painfully spelled out."
" Don't miss it
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,10,"Exciting to watch, musics are great. It is a perfect choice to spend some nice time. Highly recomended."
" What?
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,2,"Is this a movie or a YouTube commercial? No suspense, no feel for the characters, no real plot. A student Gil with a bigger budget"
" Underrated
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,7,This was quit a good movie but it was kinda a bad quality one and I hated the ending
" Very Bad and Dangerous Plot
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,1,This is one of the most HORRIBLE plots to a movie for young adults. It is full of violence and hate. It promotes dangerous dares that could lead to young adults committing self infliction of emotional and physical pain. The movie creator should be ashamed and jailed for promoting such an absurd movie. The FCC should ban such a movie from being created. This type of movie is exactly what leads young adults to such terrible events that happen in todays society. This movie should be a below 0 rating. -10 rating for me.
" Better Than Expected
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,7,"After watching the trailer, I found the premise of the movie to be interesting, but I was afraid that most of the movie had been spoiled by the trailer. I liken this to Black Mirror because it is a story that shows how social media can spiral out of control and create something very dangerous and unsettling. The ending had a nice unexpected twist which I enjoyed. I loved the cinematography of the film with the bright neon colors, because it was a nice juxtaposition to a somewhat thematically dark movie."
" The nerve...
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,3,I honestly can't believe someone had the nerve to make this movie. MGK has the nerve. Emma Roberts has the nerve.This movie is only good for background sound and maybe is a good movie if you're teenager. Other than that from start to finish it was quite cringeworthy.I can't believe ppl have the nerve to rate this 6.5. Total waste. Went to bad 39 mins after my bed time and I'm unable to say it was at all worth it.
" Nerve
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,10,10/10 - beautiful colors and cinematography along with an entrancing thrill ride of a script makes this one worth several rewatches
" Nerve-ish
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,7,"This movie was pretty enjoyable and exhausting at the same time ( the colours were too strong , too much )
The acting was fine so were the plot and their dares. It was worth watching"
" if you dare to watch this, you'll get.....
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,8,"Its the fun, its the frenzy, its the moral and it is the shame. that is what this film is about in my anarchpessimistic mind.its a fast driven paced, extremelly visualized colourfilled extreme do or dear social media are you in or out flick, that really excited me most of the time but it also had some drawbacks or as they say when speaking norwenglish in a frenzy it has also got its backsides. but is shall not elaborate to what or when in the movie, because that would spoil the fun. what i can reveal, and that is a general for lots of todays media, are the editors working on overdrive with extremely fast shifting focus with upto 40 shifts pr minute, makes my brain dizzy and my ''grey stare'' even greyer, but thats just me.im just so happy that i dont have the pressurized feeling that young people have or fears to have in todays social and social media life, e.g. virtual life. my only fingerprint ive left on the web is some coaches advise on swimming and of course my take on movie reviews on imdb, and the only thing i cdan say to all of you reading this is to put the device away for a while when feeling numb or dumb, because its just a fake most of it....will the grumpy old man recommend ''nerve''?, yes , definately, because it has some real life feeling to it, and the actors does a sweet impression, not always that good acting, but good and well driven action."
" Surprisingly bad movie with no message at all.
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,1,"The most prolific review says ""surprisingly sold with a good message"".
Sorry man, not for me.I saw this film recommended in a lot of websites.
Why would you recommend this?
The premise sounds fun. The rest, it doesn't.
Really really bad.Go get an ice-cream and enjoy it for 1hr and 36 min, you'll be much better.."
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,4,"I was very entertained for most of this movie. i enjoyed the weird premise. i like that it was very music based with lots of cool-looking scenes. this could've easily been a 3.5. but a few dumb things started creeping in here and there. and then it just became laughable. literally. also, i like dave franco, but i'm not so sure he's a good actor. (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
when she finds out that dave franco's character got another dare to bring her to the party, she got so mad, and just because of that she decided that the game was bad and she needed to stop it. even tho five seconds before she was still playing it like it as awesome. and franco getting a dare to bring her to the party isn't even that bad or like a big betrayal. ""ppl could die."" but she was the one walking on the ladder five seconds earlier. it made no sense what changed from her being all into the game to her needing to stop the game. also, the whole plan at the end and the speech she gave was so horrible and just killed the movie for me"
" Fun fast adventure
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,8,Nerve is really one of those movies that has a plot centered around such a cool concept that the movie is fun but not necessarily good. Our main character is not very interesting or fun but it is good to see her be turned into more of a rebel by our other main protagonist who is a really interesting and fun character. The side characters are good but the plot around the hackers was pretty silly. Very entertaining scenes with a very good soundtrack makes this movie honestly pretty entertaining.
" Good movie on game!
",2019-04-19 00:00:00,7,"This is a game based movie. Game is the name 'NERVE' in 2016. Well attempt by filmmaker to show us effects of the dare games on our life. Recent days we are playing PUBG following Blue Whale, Pokeman etc. Those all are from Nerve family. In real life we need hacker guys like Wes (Mark John) and Tommy ( Miles Heizer ) who can download such dangerous games and rewrite the code to modify them into good either or make them off. But real world is only commercial and there is no value of human life before commercial profit. Movie is inspired by Maze and Escape room.
Story is good and well developed. Started in a light mood and then goes into dangerous zone gradually. The climax is watchable and having some twits too. Acting done by Vee ( Emma Roberts) is fine. Others are just okay. As me there are good things in this movie that,
1. Good story
2. Interesting climax
3. Good message to youth and especially for online dare game players.
4. Good acting by leading Emma Roberts
5. Finally very enjoyable crazy credits at the end of movie.
You can watch this movie for entertainment and for a warning message."
" Had a bit of everything
",2019-03-28 00:00:00,9,"Original, interesting, good pace. Rated this movie on the entertainment value, not in an attempt to act like I'm some professional movie critic."
" Good screenplay great cinematography and Nerve game like the Blue Whale
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,7,"Nerve: first of all, has a wonderful scenario.like the blue whale game was formerly populer game on earth.If we go to the movie,I've sensed disconnections in some scenes,especially in transitions.I can say that there were irregularities in some scenes at camera angles.Because the whole image is either attracted by viewers or broadcast owners, and We can watch the film through their images,I may not have fully understood the balance.
The sound of the film is one of my favorite events in the movie,is incredibly adaptable at movie.
a good love story that we cannot fully understand from the action of the game is not overlooked.a good film that gave the viewer 1-2 beautiful messages until the last moment.I think the film could be a bit more actionable or a little bit more rushed, maybe a little bit more stressed at the end.But overall it was a nice movie not perfect but nice and I think teenage viewers it likes movie more than other viewers"
" Fight for your life.
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,10,"Nerve is a 2016 American thriller adventure film. It was directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman and written by Jessica Sharpez. The film stars are Emma Roberts, Dave Franco and Juliette Lewis.
Nerve is an online reality game where people can play this game as ""players"" or pay to watch as ""watchers"". Players accept dares voted on by watchers, try to become the winner of that day, and receive money. The main character called Vee, who is fearful, careful and boring and she has a friend Sydney who in contrast to her is really popular, adventurous and active. Sydney forced to sign in Vee as a player and here the story just begins. Vee was dared to kiss a stranger, get a tattoo, ride a motorbike. She was really good at this game a sydney started to be jelous, because she was better than her. Vee found out that someone was killed in this game and when they tried to warn police, they took their jobs, bank accounts and stole their indentities. Vee is now in secret third category of the game called ""prisoners"". If you are prisoner you will die or you can win the game and get everthying. I will not tell you how it will end. What i will say is that the movie keeps your interest right to the final minute. I really enjoyed the movie for a number of reasons. I identified with the main character the plot is really interesting, gripping and unusuall. But what I liked most was the idea of this movie and that was how social media influence our lives in negative way and we let them to controll our lives. I would definitly recommend it."
" An interesting concept, bad script
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,2,"The concept of the film itself is really interesting: the problem of needing a kick to feel oneself which seems to be an issue many teens are having these days. And I like the idea of showing the problem of anonymity on the internet.But the script is so bad it hurts:
A friend almost killed herself and no one of her close peers cares. A relationship gets destroyed and a few minutes later both friends are BFFs again.And worst: the mother sees her daughter being shot, getting back up and has a joke on her lips.Really bad!"
" Not bad.
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,7,"Actually,we can make some point of this movie. It shows that internet world is very dangerous and not for all. It was interesting.Machine Gun Kelly,really played good role."
" superb nerve racking movie
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,9,"This is a very entertaining film about daring game, a genuine adrenaline rushing game,will make you jump off your seat due to its suspense, the ending was kind of meh, and dissapointing for me but the overall idea and performace were striking there were several suprising appearances of celebrities so many were involved in this movie , really recommend it for the adrenaline junkies out there ."
" Nerve captures today's social media mindset perfectly.
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,7,"This generation is easily entertained by social media, and many of the people who use these platforms happen to care about the amount of likes, followers, or views that they receive. If you happen to go viral, you can expect to make a decent amount of money regardless of whether you use YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and/or many of today's most popular social media platforms.Nerve is a movie that portrays the mindset of today's social media users (which, of course, are mostly young adults) and the effects of the contributions that we make by repeatedly liking, viewing, and sometimes further encouraging insane behavior - which circulates these social platforms every single day... all for our own amusement.This is a movie with a message, and is not far off from today's reality. It touches on small things such as insecurity, social media addiction, and even provides some insight to the dark web, which I didn't expect.My only gripe? The story could have been fleshed out more. Emma Roberts her part perfectly but I feel that this movie should have had some more character development in regards to Dave Franco and Machine Gun Kelly's characters but over all, I enjoyed the film."
" Colorful, frantic fun
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,7,"Nerve is colorful, frantic fun. This film does a good job of making you care about the characters, even if the rules of the game are muddled and the ending feels a bit forced. It also offers pointed commentary on hiding behind anonymous online usernames. However, the most impressive part of this fictional movie is how it feels unsettlingly close to reality."
" Wow, was this movie bad.
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,1,Don't waste your time. It has an interesting concept and is decent for the first hour...then suddenly it gets dumber than you could ever imagine.
" Thinly veiled social commentary on smartphone addiction
",2018-12-21 00:00:00,10,It's all about being bored with reality with this one. A dystopian Y/A just under a different premise. Cinematography and everything was solid but the movie feels like it is as empty and vain as the characters in the film. Maybe that is the point.Good view of places in Manhattan a tourist normally would not come across. The city is definitely a leading character in the film.
" No logic. A few questions.
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,1,"Who's filming the shots, the people watching the dare? How incompetent is the NYPD? The film didn't establish the rules of the game. So, I'm left with no explanation of what the main characters can and cannot do. It needs to piece together a sense of logic, so we as the viewers can understand the rules and how the film/game works. The color palate was exhausting, it didn't set the tone appropriately."
" Kids, don't try this at home
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,5,"""Nerve"" contains a lot of gloss, speed, excitement and spectacle ; perhaps too much, since it doesn't contain much in the way of psychological depth and nuance. As a result much of the characters' motivation or evolution remains obscure. The movie isn't performing miracles in the originality department, either.""Nerve"" is also riddled with plot holes and loose ends. An exemple : the movie is about a young girl who gets sucked into an ever more dangerous game. At one point, a number of computer nerds (you know they're computer nerds because) promise her to find out who's behind the game. And indeed, they succeed in finding out the real-life identity of many of the spectators. A total success ! A resounding victory ! Sadly, the computer nerds have failed to identify the persons who provide the locations, the logistics, the technical know-how and the general framework, but : a total success.Still, the movie deserves credit for the pertinence of its warnings about peer pressure, mob mentality and fashionable follies. If it can keep even a single enterprising idiot (young or old) from jumping off a windmill while playing the bagpipes, it will have justified its existence a hundred times over."
" Wow! Loved this movie!
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,9,It starts slow and then.... you are on the edge of your seat right up until the end! I loved it and would watch it again. Haters need to quit hating!
" Millennials and younger don't listen to all the hate
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,8,"I wasn't sure until the first dare and then I was in. Didn't plan on this being a suspense yet found myself in suspense waiting to see what would be next and how far it would go. Would recommend this movie to anyone who is a Millennial or younger, somewhat tech savvy but not too much, likes a little suspense, and/or is a fan of Emma Roberts ;). Dave Franco is good too."
" the internet.
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,10,". I liked this movie's concept...it's fun and engaging. The actors did a good job with it for what it was. It's not an Oscar worthy movie by any means, but if you're bored and you're looking for something to mindlessly entertain you for a few hours this will do the trick. A little far fetched at times with regards to the antagonist(s)...but it's a good source of mindless entertainment. I've read people say it tries to actually get into serious themes...if that's the case I missed the memo cause I didn't really see any serious themes other than the availability of information over the internet..."
" Bad
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,1,Honestly really bad for multiple reasons. The portrayal of teenagers and female friends who immediately turn on each other once the other is doing well for themselves. And then the other bad talks her friend i hated it
" Super Energetic and Fun
",2018-10-23 00:00:00,10,"A very fun and energetic. Emma Roberts and Dave Franco really means well on the screen, which shows in their characters. The use of neon and strobe lighting makes the movie feel more amped up. The lights coupled with the soundtrack gets the blood pumping and, despite reason saying it's a dangerous and bad game, it makes you want to pull out your phone and become a player. Now: are you a watcher or a player?"
" Nothing more than a rip-off
",2018-10-23 00:00:00,4,"I did get a chuckle when I saw another reviewer calling this a film with ""some originality"". It's nothing more than a straight-up rip-off of the interesting Thai flick 13: GAME OF DEATH, albeit with a teen-friendly rating and a young adult feel so that you know things are never going to get too explicit or disturbing. The most interesting thing about this one is the commentary on the Internet age, which comes as little surprise given the directors are the guys behind CATFISH. Sadly, the plot itself is meandering and overlong, interesting during the set-piece challenges but entirely routine otherwise. The film loses points for starring the vapid Emma Roberts as the lead, a totally unlikeable and insubstantial figure, and Dave Franco isn't much better either. Sadly it takes more than decent direction to make a good film, and NERVE falls at the first hurdle."
" Can't believe I had the nerve to watch this...
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,3,"Film4 why are you airing this?? The Game..Saw a couple of movies that work in this genre. So this is the new generation of teenagers on how they are meant to be or how they actually are ? I don't know but it seems not all filmmaking has to have a point. Instead it portrays to kids on how to be cool and popular these days on and off social platforms and sending a disturbing message with a sinister twist...what a lot of crap. I thought it was healthy to be off your phone as a teenager..this movie promotes the opposite, violence and sexual gratification towards women just to win a game. The actors are decent but unfortunately are in the wrong movie. Target audience - youtube bloggers"
" A parody of reality TV.
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,4,"The film is full of social media tropes, complete with a nearly constant club soundtrack to constantly remind the audience how modern, hip and funky the film and it's characters are, presumably in an attempt to conceal the overall blandness of the film.The plot of the film gradually, or perhaps quickly becomes ludicrous to the point where the scenes that are meant to be serious and gripping are actually quite funny. For example, you have the people who are competing in the dark web dares video recording themselves while they are petrified. ""Hey look at me I'm scared and I'm doing a dare that will endanger my life. Still, I should make time for a selfie. *SNAP**SNAP*""There's not really much that the film offers, other than a load of deathly dares and mediocre, stilted drama between uninteresting and generic characters. However, the film picks up very very slightly when all the uninteresting characters finally get around to performing in the thriller portion of the film. Still, there are lots of tedious jump cutting scenes interspersed with the same old funky, hip club music which I think fails to establish any kind of effective pacing and instead makes these scenes more like a music video."
" Phone addiction and pressure from the crowd
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,8,"This was just a great movie of the problems in the modern time. People, especially teenagers and youngsters use way too much time online and get dragged away from reality and common sense when it comes to pressure of the crowd.Roberts made awesome job in this role, have seen few of her roles and in those she just wasn't believable to the role, but now she did a great job.Great idea for a movie, great acting, and well directed. The so well known cliché of girl drama in teenage movie was the only thing that bothered me, have never liked it in any movie."
" I don't understand why people didn't like this
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,10,This movie was SOOO GOOD OMG EMMA IS SUCH A QUEEN I want to be her and if I had never seen this movie I would have never been introduced to the AMAZING sound track
" awesome
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,10,"Awesome movie, definitly worth watching, trust me!"
" Do I have the nerve to make more puns?
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,7,"Nerve is an interesting film with an equally interesting presentation, some but not all of it takes place on a computer screen, which works in terms of the narrative and used with enough moderation to not seem tacky. The actors do a good job and the final task was kind of unexpected but at the same time predictable however I think they should have had the nerve to let Vee die after being shot as it would have shown a consequence to the game instead of everyone just kind of forgetting it was a thing. Overall 7/10 worth a watch, if you want to, and if you don't want to watch them how do you have the nerve to be reading this review"
" Liars!
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,1,"This movie lied to me. Ok, that happens, but the trailer said to me: This is going to be a horror movie that uses technology at its fullest. And this was a romantic movie with sparks of PG-13 horror here and there. In the end, it was less good than a bad Black Mirror episode."
" Completely made me excited yet stressed at the same time.
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,9,"This is what I call an adrenaline rush movie, I enjoyed every second of it, making me excited and yet stressed. Emma Roberts and Dave Franco were nontheless so suited in this movie, and played theit part pretty well. It felt like a ride of excitement and intense multiple feelings of happiness, stress and fear. Also the pictures were pretty cool, and the whole movie was captured in an artistic way. Enjoy the ride because you'll love it."

" Moderately original
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,7,"Responding to provocation from her more adventurous best friend, Vee becomes a player in online game Nerve, in which Players undertake challenges set by subscribing Viewers, performing via live phonecam videofeeds, for cash rewards. But it doesn't take long for the challenges (starting at the relatively innocuous ""Kiss a stranger for 5 seconds for $100"") to become downright hazardous.Despite a superficial resemblance to the 1997 Michael Douglas thriller The Game, this film is very much its own thing. Built on the internet tendency towards selfies and online gaming and disclosure of massive amounts of personal information, plus a leaning towards thrillseeking - we've all seen the sort of youtube videos embodying risk-taking - this film has a plausible set up and a believable escalation in the risks offered.It does, however, leave you wondering a bit about some of the later developments - how is Nerve run, why can't you get out of it, how are they able to apply certain sanctions? - which needed a tighter hand on the scriptwriting. These shouldn't have been questions that arose, let alone remained unanswered.Emma Roberts, credibly playing a character 10 years younger, does well and looks good in lingerie, and Dave Franco as her partner in crime is also fine.This is essentially an adventure thriller with mild suspense and little substance, yet it held my interest and entertained me throughout: there were some nice graphic flourishes which helped you understand how the game was progressing. Especially recommended if you are fond of taking selfies!"
" Talk about a movie that gets on your nerves
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,4,"Are you a watcher, or a player? That's the question at the center of the NYC-set millennial thriller 'Nerve.' The Emma Roberts-/Dave Franco-starrer is a commentary on the perils and pitfalls of our budding voyeuristic society as our lives continue to shift from the real to the virtual world.When an underground online game sprouts up among high school-aged kids that rewards those who dare to accept dares, all kinds of havoc is unleashed on the boroughs of New York. Roberts plays Vee - a graduating high school senior who is caught between a rock and a hard place, as she is looking to escape her simple Staten Island life in hopes of going to school on the west coast. The quiet, shy Vee decides to take a chance on coming out of the shadows, and after crossing paths with the mysterious Franco (Ian), her life is never the same.Sure, 'Nerve' is creative, but it tries really hard to be edgy. And maybe it is seen to be edgy to its core demographic, but it otherwise comes off as feeling ""fake"" and ""pretentious."" There are lots of scenes that feel like they were thought up on the spot, and they look like they were filmed on a smartphone. This effect is intentional, of course, but that doesn't signal that it's good. Yes, there are some daredevil-ish tasks that are attempted here, but they all feel muted. On the positive side, there are some great shots of the city scattered throughout.'Nerve' attempts to generate awareness of the growing issue of cyberbullying, but it does so in a way that feels cheap and hokey."

",2018-05-09 00:00:00,7,"I really liked the movie Nerve. It is very fascinating and interesting. The plot of the movie Nerve went very straight forward. It shows the importance of the roles in Dave Franco and Emma Roberts, it just very intense towards the middle of the movie, in some scenes. Overall, it was a great movie and it showed lots of pathos for the audience."
" Better Than Expected
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,6,"I heard a lot of bad things going into this film, but the concept was intriguing. It surprised me and I'm not sure where all the hate was coming from because of this film. It may have been a very ""Millenial"" film and I say this in that age range, but it was still a fun and suspenseful at times film. Nerve isn't going to be the next Godfather, but it's an entertaining watch nonetheless."
" fun until ending
",2018-03-30 00:00:00,6,"Vee Delmonico (Emma Roberts) is excited to be accepted to a college in California. She is concerned about leaving her mother (Juliette Lewis) behind in Staten Island after a family tragedy. Her best friend Sydney (Emily Meade) shows her an underground internet game called Nerve. Participants are divided between players and watchers. Players do dares for money and watchers pay to watch the players on their 24 hour adventures. After being embarrassed by Sydney, Vee decides to play. Her first dare is to kiss a stranger and she picks Ian (Dave Franco). They are then dared to partner up on an exciting journey into the city.The premise, the style, and the actors make a fun, thrilling action adventure in the city. There are little problems that can be overlooked for the most part. The conclusion is key and it does certain things to wrap it all up too neatly. It takes the fun dark web idea and slaps on a Hollywood ending. Overall, it was fun while it lasted."
" Amazing!
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,10,"I really like this kind of movies which are not far from reality. Good idea, great filming/lightning/colors and acting was suprisingly good. I enjoyed almost every minute of watching this and I wasn't bored. This is absolutely one of my favourite modern movie what I've seen!"
" Good Movie...
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie, and I will definitely be recommending this to my friends. The soundtrack for this album is phenomenal, and really helps to bring the movie to the next level. The one issue I have with this movie is I was incredibly anxious during many points, making it hard for me to focus on the actual story. Other than that, very good."
" A postmodern version of the banality of evil
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,7,"Nerve is the typical story of one who overcomes his fears by taking unexpected risks, but also the nth cinematographic representation of the Cavafy Ithaka, in which the journey (the situations the protagonist experiences) is more important than obtaining what he initially wanted: Venus, the shy young photographer of this story, begins by entering a virtual game of real challenges in order to overcome her fears and silence her friend, but ends up trapped between her own ambitions and the constant pressure from other players to get to through dangerous challenges, more money, popularity and fun. Almost at the end, a fortuitous revelation and the subsequent violation of a rule of the game will put her life at risk and lead her to design strategies to save herself.In the background, Nerve shows the ability of the Internet to house social structures that, as Hannah Arendt said of Nazism, end up functioning by themselves without control, eroding freedom and trivializing evil. But it also shows, with bluntness, two great certainties of the human condition: that in social life, we all participate by action or omission; and that in the face of the unjustified presence of death, we always seek consolation and security in our moral values."
" Amazing soundtrack
",2018-01-19 00:00:00,8,The best bit of the movie is the middle - the part where they're actually playing the game. It all goes horribly cringe as soon as Vee goes up to the policeman. The soundtrack is the best thing about this movie; it's feel good free music that fits so perfectly to the vibe of the movie.
" Enjoy for 96 minutes then forget it
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,6,"What I most like about this movie is, it is giving a message that I appreciate; taking some risks in your life is good, but don't go overboard like risking your life for just adrenaline or making yourself look cool.There is another message that I like in the film; people who are calling themselfs players are acting like their so rebellious and free while they are just puppets of watchers. I think it is happening all over in our lifes, for example I think there is no one who doesn't have experince in their puberty as; drinking alcohol and hating it, but still drinking it because it is something you shouldn't as a teenager so you feel rebellious but actually you are doing this just because you want to be accepted by your friends.It was really enjoyable 96 minutes. The film was so exciting and fun while watching. I really like the style of it, there was generally dark scenes with some neon colors, it was pleasant to look at. About sounds; I think the story was getting stronger and much enjoyable with the songs played.The start of the movie was really good, you really get into the film from the start I think, but the ending was ordinary but I still got satisfied, (SPOILER) until I see the hand with the phone, taking video.Bad side of this movie starts when you start to question the story and events. There were so many things you can say how and why. If you planning to watch this movie just don't take it too seriously, because it is kind of movie which you will watch, enjoy and never watch again and forget about it."
" Great music, good idea.....shame it fizzled out at the end!
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,6,"The music really made this movie for me, cant remember a movie recently that had as good a soundtrack for the modern age!Good acting , good idea, awesome graphic design. great music soundtrack but what happened?
It all just fizzled out towards the end and went out like a damp squib.
Going for the usual American happy ending such a cop-out and losing the sinister aspect too quickly made it less than it could have been!
Such a shame as this film had great potential right up until the end!Its still worth a watch though; its a great comment on the current social media trends and their implications and for the great music of course, well built tension , sinister angle and interesting story.Would have got a 7/10 but the end killed it for me!"
" Slick and clever, but with a ""your 90 minutes are up"" ending
",2017-11-24 00:00:00,7,"A Jeanne Ryan novel is made into a film here by Directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman. All is oriented towards the young, whose actual or potential world the piece invokes, but - first dilemma - also in some way encourages.However, dare games have been played - with all the attendant possible consequences - forever, so what is new about their being brought online is the facelessness, the attendant removal of face-to-face accountability, the possibility of transfers of real money from a huge range of sources becoming involved, and of course the very large numbers of potential participants.However, an element of self-regulation exists here, given that most watchers can only stump up 100 dollars or so, ensuring that the level of seriousness of the dares they propose remains lowish and hence fun-ish (obviously few if any would take a serious risk for such a sum, choosing instead to back out).Furthermore, in the concrete example portrayed here, the dares at the first level bring a cute-if/because-shy Vee (for Venus!) played by Emma Roberts into contact with Ian (Dave Franco), and there's a chemistry there that the darers may egg on, but certainly do not create or fully rule.Hence, at this level, though certainly worthy of the odd ""tut, tut"" (especially from older viewers), the game has its more-endearing side, and is presented in a slick, lightish, fun and at times funny way. All is of course fast-paced, has a hint of darkness, and enjoys somewhat-edgy though often also spectacular New York settings. However, we are left in no doubt that even co-participants in the realisation of dares (such as tattoo artists) are basically decent folk who keep the whole enterprise within some limits, even if parents of the kids are very effectively excluded almost from the outset.A peak of achievement is perhaps reached as the ongoing dares begin to wreck friendships, and also start to pose genuine risks to life and limb; but the much-anticipated escalation beyond even that falls flat - presumably because the makers recognise that they might be leading a fashion as well as reflecting one, and so hold back. The very ending looks distinctly tame and anti-climactic for that reason, even though it hints at the possibility of whooped-up addicts of such a game being prepared to lose the plot entirely. Of course, were they to do so, they would scarcely be worse than those flocking to Roman arenas several thousand years ago (in the times of Emperor Titus, 8000 animals were killed for public ""entertainment"" in just two days of Coliseum ""Games"" - though it is true that Emperors were occasionally disparaged by audiences if cruelty went beyond certain limits).Anyway. a sicker imagination than is on show in ""Nerve"" would see psychopaths from more-adult circles of weirdos hijack the game, offering really large payments for more-humiliating or sicker dares, but we never get to see this. Ironically also, given the precedent set in ""Indecent Proposal"" back in 1993 (!), all of those thousands of watchers are too clean-minded to suggest that Vee and Ian engage in a bit of ... you know what ... online for a larger sum of money. Given that this is not an especially risky dare, but an extremely obvious one that would indicate a desire to assume greater levels of control from ""the dark side"" among watchers, it is clear that this film ultimately lacks the courage of its convictions.This also means a inevitable blunting of the message also worked on in films like ""The Circle"" - that we are creating a kind of new species called Homo smartphonus (a term that has already been coined online, BTW) whose interconnected society and civilisation has all kinds of potential dangers and weirdnesses that are unpredicted as yet, least of all by its primary participants. Ironically, it is those on the sidelines of it, we dinosaurs, who can see the big picture better - and the film we would make would be stronger and darker than ""Nerve"".Still the film has its charms, though most of these are on display best in its first half."
" Not Horrible but the research department was non-existent
",2017-11-19 00:00:00,2,"They (I hope accidentally) used one of the old Titanium Macbooks at the start of the Movie which were usable in 2011 but can't even play YouTube now. The thing is supposed to be set around 2018/19 I guess but all the tech in it is outdated. This just really confused the hell out of me during the entire movie.It also gives off a certain 90s teenage movie flow.The worst part is the representation of the ""darkweb"" Honestly 3 mins of research on tor would've helped the producers to at least get the addresses right.Wait until you see how they represent hackers too. Also, really you should shut off the movie now if you even have a remote understanding of the term open source.Kind of not worth your time anyways unless your understanding of tech is limited to that of an 80 year old North Korean farmer.However the characters and setting are pretty well done. Difficult to judge, not horrible but not good either.One good thing I have to say is that it paints a good picture of envy in lesser humans and what it drives them to."
" Entertaining and edgy story about a risky game for teenagers
",2017-11-19 00:00:00,10,"Nerve is a great and enjoyable movie to watch! So far one of my top favorite movies, because of the direction, the cast who includes Emma Roberts my favorite actress and also a stunning woman and of course, the music which made me search for it after the movie ended. I totally recommend you to watch Nerve because the story is worth it and the fact that teenagers are playing a game which puts their life in danger makes you think a lot about our next generation and what will happen in the future. After you finish the movie I assure you that you will want to watch it again, especially if you are a teen. Because I don t want to be a spoiler I will write only 3 words about the movie that will make you watch it: dares, death and risky fun!"
" A good one time film!
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,5,"A really good premise but could be better with certain tweaks and changes. I enjoyed the idea of the game as it seems really similar to some of the stuff people do online in real life. It was fun to see how far some people would go to win. Some of the cinematography and lighting was really good. I really loved the effect used on the film poster! Certain scenes were quite tense and you can almost imagine what you might do in that situation. Emma Roberts did a good job in her role.The message at the end was kinda silly and tacked on, it needed working on. Songs often ruin certain scenes, the soundtrack needs working on or not be as prominent in the film. Overall a good film worth watching at least once."
" Are you ready for your first dare?
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,8,"Vee (Emma Roberts) and Sydney (Emily Meade) are besties. Sydney plays an on-line game called ""Nerve."" It is like truth or dare except there is no truth. You pay to watch and you get payed to play, taking the dares of the watchers. Sydney coaxes Vee into playing and Vee quickly becomes more popular than Sydney as competition across NYC escalates to the point of being criminal.The characters were very good and the film has a message about the responsibility that the viewer has, although that didn't play into the film until the very end. The production is aimed at people half my age. It is much better than a bunch of the cyber BS that is out there. So if you have grown weary of watching big foot found footage films and the cinnamon challenge on U-Tube, try this out.Guide: No F-words that I recall. No sex. Emily Meade shows her butt on a dare."
" Worst acting I've ever seen.
",2017-10-12 00:00:00,1,"Seriously can't remember a movie I disliked more than 'Nerve' the last 5 years.The plot is super high-school-ly, the acting is bad, and the movie just keeps on and on with super cheesy lines and drama than really has no meaning."
" Probably a Hit or Miss
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,7,"Given the low ratings, I had expected this movie to be a lot worse than it turned out to be. That's why I think maybe it's a hit or miss? The things is does right - some people will relate to and some people couldn't care less about?In the list of what it did right, I would say: the portrayal of the relationship between kids and their technology. Their lives revolve around technology. You even see the characters doing their things from the perspective of their screens (laptop screens or tablet screens or phone screens).The next would be the audience mentality. You have a bunch of ""watchers"" who send dares to the ""players"" and send them money when they complete the dares. The dares get more and more ruthless as the movie progresses. (Not unlike the Hunger Games audience, eh?) At points I did question whether people can really be that ruthless, but the movie implies that this audience has lost touch between the line between reality and entertainment. (Again, not unlike the Hunger Games audience.)Finally there are the characters. Yes, you have a bunch of stereotypical tropey high school characters. But there is a decent amount of effort to subvert some of those tropes.Ultimately, this is a mindless thriller. (If it tried to do any commentary on audience mentality, it didn't do a good job of it. Any commentary that I gleaned from it was by drawing comparisons to the Hunger Games.) But it's a pretty solid thriller, but probably only if the whole relationship-with-technology aspect connects with you (or if the stereotypical high school setting doesn't take you out of it)."
" Brilliant concept, entertaining
",2017-09-03 00:00:00,7,"I love this movie because of the ingenious concept of the game. I wonder what would really happen if this game was real (and with today's advancement in technology, it doesn't seem too impossible, right?). As a story itself, it is constantly upbeat but with certain elements folded 'forcefully' into the story. It wasn't smooth but it was still entertaining. A good movie for a hangout with friends."
" ""White ppl's problems""? Really!!
",2017-09-01 00:00:00,1,"At first the movie was not half bad, but I turned it off immediately when a racial slur had become part of the dialogue! America doesn't need you to insult US solely based on race. We want to be entertained, enjoy a movie, & we don't need your unrealistic terms that push whatever agenda you think we will accept. I don't accept it so start making better movies, cuz it took me several minutes to find a movie made currently that does not attempt to divide us as a country=SAD!"
" Fun Movie
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,7,"Nerve is an aesthetically-pleasing, high-speed thrill ride that keeps you entertained every step of the way. The movie is not without its flaws and, let's be honest, some pretty unbelievable scenes, but its relevancy to the internet era, its entertainment factor, and its visual eye-candy (not just the lead actors) does more than enough to make up for it.In the beginning of the movie, we meet Vee (Emma Roberts), which is short for Venus, who's not exactly the thrill-seeker of a lifetime. In fact, she's kind of weenie. Her friend Sydney (Emily Meade) tells her to live her life more so she can enjoy it more (always great advice). After Vee is rejected by her crush JP, she decides to take Sydney's advice and play the game Nerve. This is where the film really takes off. In an age where everyone wants to be internet- or insta-famous, Nerve hits this aspect on the head. Watchers pay money to watch and dare the players to do challenges, which can consist of anything from kissing a stranger to performing dangerous stunts. Players win money when they complete a dare. Beware though, because while you'll make more money the farther you go, the dares will also become more and more dangerous. Not to mention that you'll lose all of your money if you happen to ""bail"" or ""fail"". Vee meets Ian (Dave Franco) during her first dare, which is essentially what makes her press onward.However, although this movie is great fun, it's not without its flaws. There are various plot holes, various ""reallys?!,"" and the ending does wrap up just a little bit too easily.Overall, there's not denying that the cool neon blues, purples, and reds combined with the dark New York City blacks and grays is a feast for the eyes. The acting is well-done for the most part, even by Roberts who can be a hit or miss. If you're looking for a fun, summer movie where you don't want to think too much or too hard, Nerve is the perfect choice."
" Unfortunately not far from reality
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,7,"""Nerve"" tells the story of an online game gone too far when a shy New York teenager engages in challenges that ultimately could lead to her murder. It reflects on the brutal acts that get committed in modern internet under the guarding of anonymity and for the sake of likes and viewers.I like the general plot of the movie and unfortunately I think that many aspects of the Internet, including the sadism many users show, are not too far from reality. I am not so keen on the love story because it is truly cheesy and I think it's only included to make the film more suitable for larger audiences. I can understand that some reviewers felt like they were dealing with a teen movie but I do think that there are very serious topics building the background for this rather implausible story.All in all this film has its good moments and raises some questions that are worth thinking about. In the attempt to make it a financial success though, a rather stupid love story and some very implausible challenges were included."
" An interesting and original idea...
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,7,"Nerve is a game much like Truth or Dare, but without the truth. The game is structured around 2 types of people, ""watchers"", who help the ""players"" get views and help give Players dares to then complete, while ""players"" have to either complete, fail, or bail on the dare. All in all, a pretty interesting take for a film, but an enjoyable film to watch. Remember ""Snitches get Stitches!"""
" Never gets boring
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,8,"The majority of the film is amazing, it never gets boring and it has a good character development. What i really liked about this film is the atmosphere and lightning. The ending is okay, for a person who loves to guess the ending while watching the film it's a relief because it is not that predictable. The only downhill of this film is how the present the ""internet"" in a very edgy way. I totally recommend this film if you're looking for a fun and excited movies."
" Good, but only just.
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,6,"NERVE is a romantic(ish) thriller about a girl who plays the truth-or- dare version of that Blue Whale game that was a thing back in 2016. Sound exciting? If you said yes, then you're probably not sober.All snark aside, this isn't actually THAT bad of a movie. The plot itself is okay, the actors did a superbly passable job for being a bunch of teenagers, and the premise, while outrageous, is acceptable by Hollywood standards. But there's not much that goes on for about the first half of the movie, the main characters are pretty much unmemorable, and it's pretty difficult to not see the INCREDIBLE amount of product placement. In short, it's basically the YA action version of Unfriended. But there are a lot worse ways you could kill an hour and a half with."
" Teen flick with scruples
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,6,"Female-driven film about high-schoolers taking dares for money via the darkweb. The soundtrack is sickeningly girlie, yet the beats are there along with the colors. Beautifully shot and capably acted adolescent film about selling out and getting in too deep irrespective of morals and self- worth. How much money would you accept to deny your own tenet? Angst incoporated. At times, the script feels like a prognostication of the future. Yet an emphasis on young women finding a man sends the plot into bubble-gum territory. The novel adaptation by Jessica Sharzer is stellar, and the result on screen resembles an artform. Yet it remains a child's story, albeit heartwrenching and slick, embracing Gothic principles to the point of distrust in society. The cornball finale is nonetheless on-point. Likable and critically dismissable as cotton candy."
" Fast paced fun thrill ride of a movie enjoyed every minute
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,8,Nerve succeeds in blending modern technology into present day storytelling. It delivers on suspense and is reflective of the problems of today as seen in live streaming tragedies that appear in our news all to often. The characters are exciting and enjoyable and are faced with life or death conflict. This is an high anxiety driven thrilling movie with a plot that does not seem so far fetched in our social media driven present day existence.
" Phenomenal social commentary on the social media generation.
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,9,"Acting: 18/20 Writing: 38/40 Directing/Editing/Production/Etc: 36/40Overall: 92/100 A-Although this film is very much done in a high school-style, the cast does a better job than your average high school play actors. Every single cast member delivers a solid performance in this film and does justice to their characters - which were consistent and believable.Though his role is more of a side character than leading character, Miles Heizer does an outstanding job with his performance. Talented actors will shine whether they are in the spotlight or not and Heizer definitely shines in this film. He really gives himself over to the character and captures a lot of nuance for an unknown actor.This film delivers an excellent social commentary about social media and the youth today. Not only does this show in the overall plot, but the film is also rich with symbolism and subtle references.*Review: Spoiler Alert!*The symbolism and negative foreshadowing in regards to the Nerve game was executed brilliantly!There were a lot of allusions to other great films, such as Snowden, The Game, Network and Lord of the Flies.The symbolism wasn't reserved to the game though. Sydney, the adrenaline-junkie and first Nerve ""player"" we see in the film, had the words ""Teenage Dirtbag"" on her phone. Just like the game, Sydney had no boundaries and cared more about what she wanted than her friends (or in terms of the game, the players). She never once took responsibility for her own actions - even by the end. She embodied the worst of the modern, social media-obsessed teenagers.The ""cat fight"" scene between Venus and Sydney being purely verbal and not physical was very sensational and compelling. It really showed how much power words of truth can have over violence, especially between females. This was a fantastic modernized version of the cliché cat fight - especially with the line, ""You're one of those girls that peaks in high school""! (In my opinion, this was far more entertaining than the cliché physical cat fight.)The film also does a good job setting up Venus' situation in the beginning and how easily children can become victims of single mothers. While her mother has no malicious intent, Venus still has the burden that most children of single mothers have when they reach adulthood: when the single mom wants the child-now-adult to make sacrifices for the ""family"", rather than the other way around. As expected, Juliette Lewis does her usually excellent job at playing the bad mom - trying to force her fantasy about the situation on her daughter, by saying she'll be her ""college roommate"". (Yikes!)When Venus meets ""Ian"" and he is holding her favorite book, it was brilliant the way she immediately apologized after offering such an intellectual discussion about it. This was very symbolic of how many in the social media generation prefer superficiality to substance and how she felt the need to apologize for saying something smart and stimulating - something previous generations didn't experience as they weren't so anti-intellectual.There was also some allusions to the ""power of anonymity"", which were also executed brilliantly: *Since Venus and Ian didn't know their phones were recording their conversation, it allowed the unfiltered truth to come out (about Sydney having a ""revolving door of guys"" and how Venus thought ""it's sad, really"" because she's the one who's really ""insecure"". *By the finals round, the ""Watchers"" were wearing masks and bandanas to cover their identity - very similar to the modern emotional fascists aka ANTIFA. *Venus' speech exposed the ""watchers"" as being responsible in their own ways for participating, despite the fact that they wore these masks to make them brave and feel like they weren't responsible.This movie did indulge in some classic Hollywood liberties (though it did provide some balance when showing all of the ""fails"" which outnumbered the successes shown).Juliette Lewis' quote near the end, ""you guys are the dumbest, smartest kids I ever met"" was a great statement about the youth today. In some ways, they are very smart and have a ton of knowledge and education at the tip of their fingertips, which gives them a lot of potential; On the other hand, they make a lot of bad decisions and too often act impulsively, self-centeredly and carelessly (not thinking of potential long-term outcomes).*End of Spoiler Alert!*This film had a surprising amount of witty quips that were very funny and always delivered perfectly.The movie's lowest point is honestly it's soundtrack. Yikes! Most of the music was pretty awful and corny in the worst way. That being said, I do think there was a point to it, as the music was obviously lacking in artistic feel and talent; just like Millennials and younger so far have been lacking in artistic feel and talent (as a Generation compared to previous ones). With all of the other symbolism and allusions going on in this film, I don't think it's far-fetched to think the music was decided on, along the same lines.Overall this film was a phenomenal social commentary on the social media generation. A surprisingly thought-provoking teen film with compelling performances."
" Unusual modern story
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,8,"I liked this a lot. It was one of those unusual situations where I sat down to watch a movie and had no idea right to the end where it was going. It was exciting, well scripted (not overwritten, just enough) and well acted while at the same time also missing the usual vacuousness of most action films. To a degree it seemed like a Hitchcock movie in the modern era."
" Nerve doesn't cut it
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,2,"In a film about strangers on the internet getting to dare you to do things, the conventionally attractive white woman is dared to kiss an attractive boy, go on a motorcycle ride, and try on a pretty dress. Maybe you've never been on the internet before, but any trip to the comment section will destroy your willing suspension of disbelief for this film. And the ending is once again a complete misunderstanding of how the technology behind the internet works. Samira Wiley and Kimiko Glenn managed to create a lot of personality with very little screen time which is impressive but they are so underutilized that they don't make the film worth watching. The only reason this film gets a 2/10 instead of a 1/10 is because Dave Franco's abs are delicious."
" Somewhat Impressed
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,8,I didn't expect anything from this movie never seen a trailer never heard anything about it...Now Audio... 9 Acting 9... video 10 ...... story 9 and the selection of actors worked great for the movie now the only issue was predictability but even knowing what would happen next it was still a great movie and i feel a great watch! with some surprises that kept me highly interested the whole time.
" Creative, Enjoyable, Overall Amazing
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,9,Nerve was one of my favorite movies of 2016. It shared a good message while overall displaying amazing content. When recapping this movie it made me think how amazing it was how people can just start playing for fun and it can lead them into a whole different situation. This movie was easy to understand and definitely makes you think.
" Obviously a teen movie
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,3,"I'll keep it short. As a filmmaker, I found it boring and predictable. It had a good message, but it turned out just to be a romance movie. I was hoping something more darker. ""I dare you to rob this store for 10k."" ""Assault this guy for 5k."" It makes no sense why someone would get a few thousand views for kissing a random stranger, or riding on a motorcycle. Just stupid all around. Meh.. All I gotta say is, thank god for foreign markets..."
" All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,8,"The plot of the film is arguably simple: A ""truth or dare"" app spreads across a city and mesmerizes its audience--which grows by the day--to finally become a dystopian source of abuses which jeopardizes the lives of the ones who ""dare"".More than a movie it's a social and modern criticism of the behavior that can be induced by social networking challenges but also by the addiction we have to stories that turn sour. This movie sheds light on our own vice as viewers who always want to see more no matter what happens to the ones who make up the stories we watch. Who never found themselves scrolling down the news to skip the ones about happiness and love to go to thrilling stories about murders, accidents or worse? This movie is exactly about that. The more dangerous the challenge, the more view it has. Besides, it's typically the modern media ethos which makes the most of violence to entertain a massive audience that is described in this movie. The violence in this movie is actually overwhelming since at the end we get to see how many people participated in this madness which leads to the shooting challenge. By watching you are an accomplice and this issue often eludes us. It reminds me of a novel in which an old lady gets harassed on the NYC metro but the narrator just sits there and waits for someone else to react. (Bright Light, Big city by McInerney). We are in this society in which we find entertainment spying on one another under the cover of anonymity, and it can hurt.Other than that the photography is quite top notch as the top review argued. the colors, the design, the filming, the lighting. Everything is so city-like and modern, with an engrossing soundtrack to improve the atmosphere. The acting is very good too. The story was pretty believable if you suspend your disbelief for a while because, indeed, many questions will arise. The police does nothing but a kid can hack the system and save everyone... Quite far-fetched. The final challenge was well thought-out. Quite a plot-twist there although the fact that the schoolmates actually voted to kill the girl quite shocked me. That was pretty messed up. But yeah you never know what your neighbor's really like.In the end the movie has a solid plot, a great moral, and gripping cinematography. The rate is too low for me who was pleasantly surprised by this movie which at first just looks like a teen movie, but which is actually a consistent criticism of modern society."
" A novel film about the digital age we live in
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,8,"I was pleasantly surprised by Nerve as I was not expecting much. This film definitely exceeded expectations. It introduced a novel concept of a digital game that while fun at first becomes seriously dangerous. What is interesting about this film is it is somewhat plausible this kind of thing could exist. Technology is advancing at a great rate and we are increasingly becoming obsessed with electronic devices. People spend a great deal of time online and devote a lot of it creating profiles. Nerve certainly should strike a nerve or chord with younger generations to show the importance of humanity and people as it was humanity that prevailed in this film and shut the system down. It was interesting and managed to deliver a message. Good performances from James Franco and Emma Roberts who helped carry this film. Surprised with the rating, I was expecting a higher one."
" Snappy exploration of the black mirror
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,8,"Imagine a not-too-unrealistic online game where the players are encouraged, motivated and lightly coerced by an anonymous gamemaster to do stunts IRL, which are then broadcast to and rated by the anonymous viewers. The stunts become increasingly more dangerous until it becomes obvious that the viewers are insatiable for sensation, and the whole thing is out of control.This is a fast-paced, engaging movie that I found to be thoroughly enjoyable to watch. The visuals and music are appealing. Emma Roberts and Dave Franco were competent and worked well together.It was one of the first movies I've seen to actively explore where our new online culture is taking us. In that sense, it's not that different than a ""Black Mirror"" episode. Is there any role in our brave new world for trust, privacy, decency, altruism, etc.? There are a few plot holes, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film for what it was. It's worth about 7.5, but I'm rounding it up."
" In the end, I wasn't satisfied
",2017-05-26 00:00:00,5,"When I initially saw the trailers and plot description, it sounded a LOT like the manga ""Dead-Tube"" which explores similar themes. (Only with a LOT more gore)- But the manga takes its time exploring the ideas and thoughts about the theme, something the movie half-assed about, which was one of the main reasons that by the end of the movie, I didn't feel satisfied. They had a GREAT concept. The actors weren't bad at all. But the lack of exploring and eventually making the main character say one of the main messages directly really ruined it. She literally screamed at the audience (Us and in the movie) the moral of the story. ""Show, don't tell"" is an important rule- Both in writing and in film making. Beyond the lack of deep exploration, I felt the music didn't fit. It was too... ""Pop"" for me. I expected slow songs or scary songs at the appropriate time, but it was all pop pop pop. The lack of diversity bothered me in that aspect. Probably because it felt contradictory - mindless pop vs (a supposedly) deep movie. Or was it mindless? idk, I guess I just dislike pop. But my point on lack of diversity still stands. Moving on! The characters. Two problems. Ian/Sam. How the hell a guy who fights for his FAMILY and his own sake, falls in love in the middle of his own manipulations? It felt forced and not genuine. If he had betrayed her in ""the moment of truth"" it would feel much more genuine and honest than ""well... he just falls for her mindlessly lole"". And the fact that the other male character what's his name... The hacker guy. I just felt SAD for him. Even by the end. He didn't even develop a personality beyond the ""stereotypical hacker-beta male who's in love but can't express it or something"". Now, a plot-problem - Wouldn't anyone see via their phones the other major player switching to fake bullets? Aren't they under constant surveillance? If you or the movie have an answer for this - I'll up my rating to 6.I think the movie should have ended like this:Ian betrays Vee near the end (probably around the snitching part), Vee who is heartbroken yet determined to get her life back and even some revenge contacts her friends to make the plan to crash Nerve. In the big finals SHE AND HER FRIENDS switch all the bullets to fakes (And Vee would've been in charge to do the same to her own gun, yet she doesn't switch bullets in order to get revenge on Ian). She fakes her own death (Since no one knows the bullets aren't real), and then shocks the audience by rising up from the ground and you can imagine the rest. This could have given out the same results in terms of theme and the final message to the viewers (of the movie) with bigger and more fun twists and turns. ""The mask of anonymity won't protect you forever, and what you do online can come back like a boomerang"".At least it's my opinion about it."
" The intensity is missing
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,5,"We choose to watch this movie with a low expectation. I was right to assume,there are few bits that are good but most parts are slow and doesn't make sense in a way that it's very uncharacteristic by the protagonist. The trailer of the movie gave it away too. Emma Roberts and Dave Franco don't have any chemistry at all. There are some kissing scenes when you can see that he squirmed or pulled away a bit."
" Apparently teens will risk anything to get famous
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,6,"So the concept is this: a new website/app arrives, called Nerve. There are two options, to be a player or a watcher. Players get given dates by the watches and receive money for completing dates. The watchers have to pay to watch and are basically all crazy cult like about this game. People either 'fail or bail' and eventually the game will go down to two people.I actually thought this was quite a good idea. Is it really so unbelievable that a website like this wouldn't pop up, knowing the risks people will take for money and fame? The first hour of the film was good, but then you find out about the secret third mode 'prisoner' and it all becomes ridiculous after that. It is absolutely unbelievable that the police would not find out about the game or just simply not care about it. The cult following of Nerve is also dumb af, who would want someone to die over a game? It doesn't even look majorly exciting to watch to be honest, not exciting enough to have such a weird obsessed fandom anyway. We never find out anything about the people who create Nerve either. I get that our cute little team of hackers took down all the servers at the end, but I don't see why the creators couldn't just simply start it again. Also where did the big stadium come from in the showdown? Like I said, it is impossible that no authorities know about this! It's also crazy that after their big fight, Sydney forgives Viv in a heartbeat, when she seemed like such a cow earlier, but hey.The cast was pretty good, Dave Franco and Miles Heizer are great as usual. The soundtrack was obviously aimed at 'edgy teens', what with the likes of Halsey and Melanie Martinez. Overall I like the techie vibe to it.In conclusion, after the first hour all the plot holes become glaringly obvious and it gets stupid, but up until that point it's enjoyable. Aside from that there's nothing really that lets it down, so a decent film for us crazy millennials I guess."
" All in great movie would recommend
",2017-05-17 00:00:00,10,"So the idea is great execution is meh but not that bad director did a good job i don't remember this movie having hardly any soundtrack maybe 3 songs.I wont tell you what is the movie about because others have explained already.The ""story"" is great and it tells about all of these games today for e.g. take the new game Blue Whale(don't play it or search for it) literally does same thing like game nerve in the movie gives you dares but no rewards tough :D Kind of got the feeling i know where BW idea came from.Well thats it for me.Enjoy the movie!"
" I will make this SUPER Simple
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,3,"Looking for something to watch and came to this page wondering if you should or shouldn't with this one?No problem! I will make this super simple.If you are between 9 years old and 15 years old I think you will enjoy it.If your IQ is below 95, you will probably enjoy it.If you are a hormonal teenage boy (extra points for loving cheerleaders) (double bonus points for enjoying social media) you will like it a lot.If you are a grown man who is a voyeur and enjoys young girls in various stages of undress and inanity, you will most likely enjoy it (with the volume off).There you have it folks. I'm being serious too."
" Plot line may have slightly lacked but the acting quality made up for it
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,8,"Emma Roberts and Dave Franco play the main characters and are by far the best actors in this film by far. The emotions shown by Emma give a convincing and relate-able character which the audience can understand while Dave is more mysterious and interesting in contrast to Emma. Their plot was thrilling and tense while other sub plots in the film failed to show either traits and sort of let down the film a bit. The soundtrack was intelligently chosen and the casting of Dave and Emma obviously was a good choice. The only good sub plot was Dave's characters past and I liked how it was linked into his slightly broken personality, allowing the ""ah f*ck it"" choices he makes to make sense. Would recommend to those who liked the film Drive with Ryan Gosling as I would compare it to that."
" A below average great idea that ultimately fails
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,4,"I had heard lots of buzz about this film and I have now see it and I feel like on paper this would be a great idea but the film ends up being a big disappointment. The premise of the film sees a high school student come across an online game of truth or dare, without the truth. Emma Roberts plays V and she does an alright job in this film, she gives her best to the role it is just her character isn't that interesting. I found myself not really caring about her character that much which is disappointing. Dave Franco plays another player of this game and he does a good job in the role, he isn't as funny in this role as much as he has in other roles. He sold his daredevil persona well and I bought his character for this film. Unfortunately, all the other characters in this film are bland and just very cliché that you just won't care about them or the situations they are put in. The story of the film has some interesting dares in it as you see these two people work there way through the challenges, I can't deny that it is fast paced and interesting to watch. However, I didn't buy the relationship between Roberts and Franco and I felt like it was pretty forced and unconvincing. Also the third act takes a big change from the rest of the film and it is just not interesting really at all which really hurts the film. The script doesn't have any really cheesy or bad dialogue it is just so forgettable that I don't really remember one bit from the film's script. The style of the film has some too stunts and dares, buy I don't feel like it goes extreme enough for it to be realistic which is a shame for this film, maybe it could have done with a higher age rating. Overall I didn't care for nerve and I don't really think it is worth seeing at all."
" Poor. Not a good watch my friends
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,2,"Makes me sad even bothering to rate this film. Cringey, predictable, unfunny, unrealistic. I will be completely honest. It was a great idea but it was sort of like it was directed by a teenage girl. Good effort but would much rather place my head on a rock and wait for many years for some sort of space debris to smash into my skull than put myself through that again. Disappointed all round with this film as it looked positive. Bonus star for a Franco."
" Good dumb fun and a potential franchise starter
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,6,"Returning to the technology based groundwork that served them so well with the 2010 documentary (or is it?) Catfish, filmmakers Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman this time turn their focus onto the world of online voyeurism and communities with the way better than it should be Nerve, a fun, fast and colourful experience that loses its way in the home stretch but offers a great time leading up to it.Conjuring up an online game that feels like it could quite possibly exist in today's modern climate of online trends, social media and wannabe superstars, Joost and Schulman imbed Nerve with a strange form of reality that both says something about the climate of our tech savvy and obsessed life, whilst offering up a fun form of adventure to the dark side of the world wide web as Emma Robert's Venus and Dave ""charisma free"" Franco's Ian team up to compete in an online version of truth or dare (without the truth), fuelled by watchers and donators that lead the duo on an increasingly dangerous journey.The set-up of this idea as Vee and Ian meet and take off on a night of dares is far-fetched in many regards but undoubtedly fun and Roberts and Franco make for a good double team as Joost and Schulman instil Nerve with an eye-catching colour palette, while the hip soundtrack fits the style of the film perfectly making the production a polished and inviting one that for a large portion of the films brief runtime offers up great entertainment, until the film losses its nerve on the back of increasingly outlandish and over the top scenarios.From blindfolded bikes rides, questionable character decisions, right through to a thoroughly misjudged finale that feels like it belongs to another film altogether, Nerve sadly can't maintain its initial drawing power which is a shame as the whole universe here feels well built up but unsure of its end game, even if this premise feels as though it could quite easily become some form of Saw like franchise for tech driven thrills and spills.A pleasant and frenetic cinematic diversion, Nerve may not reach the heights it sometimes threatens to get to but this unique and often thrilling premise makes for one of last year's best teen targeted pieces of eye-candy and a potentially franchise starting event that could well be one of the better new properties to emerge in recent years.3 mooning's out of 5"
" Black Mirror?
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,6,"It's not Oscar worthy, but it was quite entertainment. At some parts I was sitting on the edge of my seat covering my eyes. I could not be a watcher. (Would'nt be a player either for that case.) It reminded me of the series Black Mirror, which shows the dark side of life and technology... how technology can dehumanize humans. It's not my new favorite movie, but it did help me procrastinate for an hour and 40 minutes."
" Shockingly stupid movie
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,2,"Give a 10 year old to write a screenplay for movie and you'll have something similar. If we assume the movie is about kids then it is much more acceptable. I gave the movie rating 2, simply cause there was some good prerequisites for it to has a nice atmosphere. The scene where they're crossing the bridge on the motor, going to the city is the only argument to call this piece of frames actually a ""movie"". Even if we assume this is fun/no brainer flick made for kids, the lack of plot holes and nonsense is simply more for me. Basically I'll put this film into the bottom 20 films I've ever seen. I don't think I somehow appreciate good movies, in a way better than the people who rated it more than 5.It is just very important and determining the factor, where we find ourselves in our ""life movie"", how we judge and rate one. The first 20 minutes are enough to make a judgment whether this one is okay for you or no. The statement and the vibe are pretty clear. It doesn't really get better."
" Truth
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,8,"I have to say, when I started the movie, I really freaked out at the stunts/dares that were given. But once the movie was over, I could see the truth the movie has about our own society. Those who said yes to the last dare depict real people we already have, people who prefers to watch the violence play out. In fact, they encourage it especially when they know that there won't be consequences as long as they keep their identity hidden. This is the ugly truth, the message that I feel the movie is conveying,"
" Nerve (2016) - Oh, wow..
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,10,"This is, by far, one of the most fun I've ever had watching a film. It has lovely cinematography, and the lights are so powerful. It has brilliant story, but also dangerous that makes you think about how much of a monster is the Internet. And plus I thought Emma Roberts was really good in it. 10/10"
" An entertaining film with a lame climax!!!!
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this film for a good 80% of it or so, throughout it keeps you on your toes, you feel compelled to be engaged into the dares and the excitement they bring. The connection between events and persons from dare to dare is really commendable because that makes you feel as a viewer that anything can happen here, anything and anyone can come out of nowhere.The climax though turned out to be pretty lame, and that whole thing firstly with police not taking it seriously, and then the imprisonment thing looked a bit too much and overboard; and hence the ending from thereon was never going to go anywhere, sadly.Overall, I'd still give it seven out of 10 for the entertainment that it brought and how it was fully able to engage me into it - till the climax at least!As a side-note though, the film delivers a good message for the teenagers and the youth of our age (who spend all their day on their computers and smart-phones)."
" Almost feel something like this could happen nowadays
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,7,"Nerve was an entertaining movie but it asked for a lot of suspension of disbelief.The strength of the film is the possibility that all of this could happen, born out of the feeling of anonymity that virtual lives allow. It explores that power to the limit.In this game called Nerve, there are players and there are watchers. Players have to accept challenges, or dares, which get progressively more difficult to fulfil, even life-threatening, but the reward is exponentially higher as well. Winning the challenge is part of the game, the other is getting more followers. So all these people gather around following their favourite players both online and in real life, rooting for them.There was so much I didn't get about this game and how the movie progressed.How are the dares chosen? Only towards the end do we get an inkling of an explanation – that they are voted by the majority. OK but who creates them in the first place and out of so many thousands of people how many are necessary to get a dare through? Do they all vote? It seems like a somewhat long process given the speed at which they came up.Who created the game? Who wires the money and how? Who decides if the challenge is passed or failed, since it is not always that obvious?One of the challenges was for Ian to take Vee to the city. What if she had said no? Would he have lost? Was he supposed to take her by force?Also one of the rules is that for the dare to count it must be filmed by the player's phone. I got so confused because the scenes would be filmed as if the player was holding the camera when they were obviously not The motorcycle challenge was the one where this showed most blatantly. There is no way either of them could have filmed that, or even a watcher, not from that angle.The movie is so fast paced that probably folks won't be thinking about most of these things but I couldn't get them off my mind. It just did not seem plausible for such a concept to exist in this fashion. It needed to be much more polished.Also, the ending was totally anti-climatic since those issues were never explained, particularly about who created the game and how it worked. And having kid hackers admonish the watchers and that's it, game over, slap on the wrist and people simultaneously gain a conscience and the game is destroyed was beyond ridiculous for a resolution of such a story.The main character's evolution was a bit too dramatic. She is portrayed as a bookworm with little to no self-esteem, cannot even speak to a guy she likes, and we are presented with a knockout of an actress who I can never believe is any of those things. She shines so much more than her so called star friend. Anyway, assuming she was all that, I get that Vee gets carried away by the entire thing and it is a journey of discovering herself but some things were really extreme and it just struck me as not believable. Then there were all the clichés about the friend who obviously likes her more than she does, the jealous friend, and so on.With all these things that ticked me off, Nerve is still a fast- paced movie which makes you wonder about possibilities in today's world and how things can so easily change in the blink of an eye and how everything we take for granted may vanish and especially that just because we are anonymous online it does not mean our words and actions do not count or have no power.I had fun. I wish the concept had been developed better but I had fun."
" Don't judge a book by its cover
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,10,This is a movie that keeps you on your toes and not very predictable. I was surprised and taken back during moments and never expects many events that happened. This is a great movie to watch after judging it and believing it would not have got that perfect rating from me. The cast was very different but really enjoyed watching these and all the different people.
" Nerve-a wild motorcycle ride-born to be wild
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,10,"So, what'd you do if you had an iPhone, and a different but similar game to Pokemon Go? Well, if you were someone like 17-18 year old Vee Delmonico (EMMA ROBERTS), you'd play ""Nerve"", the game where ""watchers"" watch you ""play""...if you know what I mean. Emma's fellow players are best pals Sydney (EMILY MEADE) & Ian (DAVE FRANCO, brother of JAMES) who get caught up as other friends, most notably Asian Liv (KIMIKO GLENN most known for ""Orange is the New Black"") are watchers. This takes a devilish turn..devilish, when Ian and Ve(Venus) get on motorcycle, racing across their native (nighttime Brooklyn, New York NYC!) streets then Vee goes it alone.

" Interesting plot, failed to fully deliver
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,7,"I'm an anarchist and nope, anarchy doesn't work this way. (At least that's what I've learned from the books I've been reading and not the movies I've watched which are telling me otherwise.)I like the film. It's interesting. It's realistic given that in today's society with the prevalence of social media among people, teens especially, everything, or most things anyway, is done for the sake of views, likes, hearts, shares, re-tweets, or whatnot. People aim to be internet famous not so much as be an actual TV or big screen celebrity.That is our reality now.Not that I'm complaining. I, for one, love the internet and that's not because I also need the constant approval of anonymous individuals (I don't, although getting a nod here and there ain't bad sometimes), but because I get to reach out easily, or at least easier than it would be before the internet was made available to everyone or almost everyone (Jae for example 😜).But it still remains scary how most people find the necessity to receive nods from complete strangers to feel, well, complete. It's scary but every time I open my social media accounts, I see people doing almost everything to become viral and have their 10 minutes of fame. It's crazy. And have I said that it's scary? Because it is.And you know what's scarier? Knowing that Nerve's reality is actually not that far from this world's reality.Given all that I'm still giving the film a 6.5. Why? It could've tried to take itself more seriously but it chickened out and gave us a happy ending wherein good defeats evil (or busybodies who like making other people do dares they won't do themselves even with their lives on the line). Yup, exactly how a teen friendly thriller would run.P.S. I changed my mind and I'm now giving it an 8 because Dave Franco. I watched this for Emma and stayed for Dave. I know a couple of Ians in real life but his Ian sets the bar for how Ians should be IRL."
" This techno thriller is nothing intelligent, but for what it's worth it is at least fun
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,7,"This techno-based thriller directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman of the 2010 documentary 'Catfish' is not your average suspense vehicle with white-knuckle thrills and startling imagery. It introduces an original concept soaking with intriguing social commentary about digital technology and its effects on our society. And the central figure of this film's plot involves a smartphone app version of ""Truth-or-dare"". Taking elements from the popular app 'Pokemon Go', this app plays a vital role in a plot that the directors not only successfully provide with both suspense and witty humor, but also serves as an allusion of teenagers' ignorance with technology and social media in today's society. While Joost and Schulman's execution of this concept isn't exactly illogical nor do they show interest in character development and plot, the final result is a fun ride for teenagers and adults to snack on. So this film stars Emma Roberts as Vee, a high school senior who introduces to this phone app called 'Nerve', an location-based augmented reality game where users are given to choices to either enter as a ""watcher"" or a ""player"". A player is tasked a complete a dare on live broadcast such as ""kiss a random stranger"" or ""try on a dress at a store"", and the player must complete the dare in order to move on to the next round (and earn money). A watch is a user who suggests the dares online while spectating the players live. Under the pressure of her friend Sydney (played by Emily Meade), Vee partners with a cute guy name Ian (played by Dave Franco) in a series of increasingly dangerous dares. But the game soon places their lives in danger when the dares begin to border on the line of breaking the law.The concept alone is enough to grab the attention of high school-aged kids, or anyone engrossed the familiarity of the 'Pokemon Go' app. By some means, Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman manage to provide some good surprises here and there with a solid plethora of suspenseful thrills, clever humor, and a sweet dose of social commentary that feels brutally relevant today; that is if you can buy into the overwhelming absurdity of the plot. In an age when social media such as Youtube has become a major part of teenagers' lives, it is not uncommon for teenagers falling cyber pressure to take risks and engaging into dangerous activities that become vital trends on the internet (i.e Cinnamon Challenge). Under Joost's and Schulman's execution, the plot serves almost as an allegory to the influence of social media and the deadly consequences that ensue. And it is safe to this film does an okay job with this, though it could have been accomplished better. As the story goes on, our two lead characters (who are both energized likable performances by Emma Roberts and Dave Franco) engage in a series of foolish shenanigans that start off somewhat innocent, but the real suspense kicks in when they evaluate in more precarious stunts such as scaling tall structures or walking across ladder placed several stories above an alleyway. These scenes are heart-clenching enough and are fueled with sheer suspense and sweet cinematography to capture the neon-drenched environment of downtown New York. The final act however, is when the film makes a rather overblown turn and immediately throws logic out the window, although it is not like the film's concept packed much logic to begin with. In the end, the key to finding enjoyment in the story requires just a little more than not asking ""Why don't they just shut the app down?"" or ""Why would anyone make an app like this?"".Nerve is a suspenseful techno-based thriller that may not fuel your engage your brain but nonetheless generates a fair amount of fun and thrills for anyone filling to buy into the absurd premise. It is a fun treat for both teenagers and adults, but only the ones not seeking for a smart script with character development and intelligence. Otherwise, this one may be disappointing."
" Clever and Unique
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,8,"The movie is actually clever. It depicts how modern social life has become. Everyone is into mobile phones and social media.And this movie shows a very creative game which involves real humans doing real things while gaining thousands of viewers. Pretty neat and unique indeed.The stakes get higher as the game progresses. But unfortunately the ending was not too spectacular or mesmerizing.The narrator should have picked a more spectacular ending rather than a fake dying scene.Other than that, the entire movie is very interesting and fun too watch."
" Unexpectedly amazing movie, simply a masterpiece.
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,10,"This movie was extremely fun to watch. It may be partly due to the fact I immediately fall in love with everything Emma Roberts stars in, but don't blame me for this. She is an amazing actress after all (and not only because she is unbelievably beautiful), I wish she got more roles like this one. Because of my appreciation towards her, I didn't set too high expectations for the movie itself, I just wanted to see her acting and enjoy it. However, what I got was an unbelievably entertaining movie, which I would have definitely enjoyed even if she wasn't cast for the main role. Great acting, good story, one of the best films in years. It made me think and still kept me entertained.Let's start with the acting. It was perfect all the way. I could start analyzing all the characters one by one, but it is not necessary. Emma Roberts is just brilliant in the role of Vee (an introverted high-school photographer, who joins a dangerous game in hope of some fortunate outcomes), Dave Franco also delivered his role like it had to be delivered, and the supporting cast was also okay. Enough said.The plot actually gives us what it promised (if not more), and it is quite rare these days. We get a coherent story, believable motivations, detailed and developing relationships of characters, interesting background and a maybe expected, but still a bit twisted outcome. When I first read about the plot, I didn't really believe I would actually get what I expected. The various dares were especially interesting, way better than most movies would have done them. Riding a motorbike blindfold? How awesome is that? This film could have gone wrong in so many ways, and yet it was just perfect. The photography also stands out, one of the most beautifully photographed films in ages, the colors, the shades, the places all contribute a lot to the atmosphere. And the music also fits. Well done, good job. Masterpiece. Haven't seen such an outstanding movie in a while, and if all the action, drama, thrill and even some fun in the movie weren't enough, it even has its own moral, which is worth thinking about.This movie again confirmed that Emma Roberts is one of the most talented, brilliant and unfortunately quite underrated actresses out there, and it also gave back my faith, that Hollywood may still be able to produce some entertaining stuff. Wish I could see more like this. Perfect movie, definitely recommended for anyone, 10/10."
" Promising premise, promising visuals, meh execution
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,6,"Hot on the heels of Black Mirror's provocative grounds, the neon aesthetics-fueled ""Nerve"" spawns from a promising premise and a delivers a careless and light execution that while harmless could have proved so much more interesting if it wasn't for its desperate appeal to Millenials. Profuse with promising visuals and inspired sounds, both also screaming for a more serious, adult and deep approach, Nerve directors Schulman and Joost go through a hole aplenty plot with such vibrancy and enthusiasm fast pace assertiveness, worthy of a CW TV show, that the final result is somehow not detrimental despite a convenient and frankly eye-rolling conclusion."
" Brilliant!
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,10,"I don't have the right words to explain what this movie actually is saying. Thats not so good for a man wanting to become a critic, but for this one its true. I doubt even the writers realize what they actually create!This movie represents every single no- life gamer out there. And i say no- life because that is a real thing. 20+ 30+ even 40+ years old without family, not only husband/wife, but parents too if they live in different city/country in rental homes. No friends, just nothing. No- life means your ""friends"" is the computer and the strangers and i will caps here- STRANGERS that you play with. In the movie Vee had a few friends, but the writers made it as clear as possible that she is a wallflower. No-lifer gamer doesn't have time to eat (and i mean it !!!), sometimes he doesn't have time to sleep even! And the worse thing is that the no- lifer thinks this is actually a good thing- to play for 20 hours and to sleep for 4. And that in most cases is life threatening, exactly like in the movie. Every single no- lifer, that realize what really happened to him will recognize himself in that movie. The sad thing is that in most cases there is no ""happy end"" for them. I know all this because i was/am? a no- lifer and i hate it!Emma Roberts, brilliant! Her act was perfect. The worst act winning prize goes to Machine Gun Kelly. Dave Franco good like always but he should continue develop his acting skills, so far so good! Emily Meade, you have much to learn."
" intense action to cautionary tale
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,7,"Nerve came as quite a surprise for me, it was a very intriguing thriller that delivers on multiple fronts. FIrst of all the premise and narrative of the film were really great, it was fun, intriguing and also shows a darker side of modern day society. The whole watcher and player dilemma and the idea of risk taking was also an idea interestingly discussed in this film.Both leads Dave Franco and Emma Roberts gave probably their best performances outside of their comedic roles. The way the film meticulously brings us into this game which starts of very innocent but takes a turn for the worst halfway through was really great. Perhaps reflecting the dangers of games and gaming now a days, how gaming starts off fun can really takeover people's lives and eat away at people. In an age where there are constantly news of people dying at internet cafes the absurdity that the film possess may not be such an absurdity but rather the reality. This film was not only well filmed and intriguing but at the same time serves as a cautionary tale to modern day society."
" Mostly for the teenage crowd
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,5,"Didn't really dig this too much, started out watchable but got below mediocre as it went along.The movie feels like it was aimed primarily for teenagers in mind so I am probably not the target audience, even though I can enjoy movies like that usually anyways as long as they are well-made enough. But didn't think this one was.The plot is the biggest issue, the whole set up of how the watchers and players scheme works just doesn't make a whole lot of sense and the plot holes just piles on top of each other after a while.And the acting is not the best, Emma Roberts and Dave Franco are usually pretty solid but they couldn't make this movie any better, rapper Machine Gun Kelly might want to take a couple acting classes or something... Could be the director's fault though I guess.Also the music was very intrusive, really loud electronic, club pop music being played almost non-stop... I don't mind some of the songs on the soundtrack (even though some I definitely did) but even the okay ones got distracting.So yeah not too impressed even though it had a cute moral tale message in the end for the audience it's aimed towards.If you are an adult I recommend '13 Sins (2014)' with Mark Webber instead, far superior movie with a similar plot in terms of the game side of things at least."
" Nerve-wrecking
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,7,"Or something along those lines. For some this may feel very boring, but others may actually enjoy this. It depends if you buy into the ""high concept"" of the movie. The one shot idea if you want to call it that. The actors are doing a really good job conveying their feelings and the dread they are experiencing.This is not the first movie to use an idea like this. But it's the most tech savvy (up until the end that is, which is at the very least questionable) one up to date. If you are into this kind of thing you will be entertained enough. The question you have to ask yourself is, if you are just watching ... Well the disc and it's extras do ask you that. The Behind the scenes stuff is on the Watcher tab, the Dare tasks are on the Player tab. So there is more to the movie experience than just watching it"
" Was actually pretty good try thinking about it a different way.
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,9,"I'd say maybe about an 8 actually but some of these ratings are unfair I believe. I know a lot are saying the same thing oh it's been done before and shows how far people will go for views but I think the beauty of it more so is the flaws it points out in the watchers. Far too many today hide behind their anonymity and think it's OK to do whatever horrible thing as long as they don't get caught. All across the Internet I've seen people telling others to kill themselves, threats of murder, threats of rape, and all sorts of discrimination because people know no one will take action against them as long as they're hiding online. The end of the movie was pretty accurate to me that there are a great many who would want something like watching someone be murdered for their entertainment because they can't get in trouble for it. It's only in the end they bailed once they were afraid they had been caught. It doesn't just show how far an attention seeker will go but how far an entertainment seeker would. Some of it was predictable but I like a movie willing to say yeah humanity is pretty messed up."
" Are You a Watcher or a Player?
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,7,"Nerve is the kind of movie that hooked me from the start. I was curious when I first saw the trailer on You Tube. Even though the trailer sort of give away a lot. I was intrigued by the premise of an online truth or dare style game (minus the truth). It was one of those rare times where I went to see a movie by myself. Normally I see movies with my brother or entire family. This was an exception because I was the only one who had any interest. One of my secret obsessions is prank videos, so this was the movie for me. Is it a good movie, it depends on your point of view. I loved the concept for the movie. One of the best things about the movie is its color palette. The movie is filled with stellar neon pinks, greens, and blues. Another positive is the chemistry between Emma Roberts and Dave Franco. As well as the teen humor and building tension near the end. So I loved the movie. Watch the movie and judge for yourself. Do you accept the challenge?"
" Dull
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,3,"A nice girl, Vee, succumbs to peer pressure and starts playing an online/social media game of dare called ""Nerve."" The game swallows up all the person's social media info. A person can lose by bailing or failing. And ""snitches get stitches."" A player who succeeds in a dare gets money deposited in a bank. The dare has to be filmed with the person's cellphone and is thus put live in the net for viewers to see. The player goes up in rank depending on how many viewers he has. At the end of the day two players face each other and the winner takes all.Vee's first dare is to kiss a stranger in a diner. Then the stranger starts dancing and singing to Vee. That was his dare. Then the game teams them up for dares, separates them, teams them back up. They have to go to a fancy department store, put on fancy clothes, speed on the motorcycle, get tattoos.Vee's best guy friend doesn't like all this especially because Vee and the other guy are getting closer now. So he does some research and finds out stuff about the guy. Meanwhile, Vee's success puts a strain on her friendships.About an hour into the movie finally the stakes are raised. Another contender for #1 is a pretty wild guy willing to do anything. And when things become life-endangering, Vee's friends, who conveniently happen to be hackers, and her mom intervene.Granted that I'm not the intended audience for this movie, I found it to be pretty dull, even for young adults. There's not much at stake for most of the movie. It just uses occasional POV camera-work to attempt to inject thrills, but it doesn't succeed. The cast mainly stands out for its big teeth but not much else. Not even relationship are made meaningful enough. Like back in the 90s, this movie seems more interested in trying to sell kids some music. I'll give it some points for being fairly good-natured and not too perverse and also for it's main point which I take it to be a warning about the dangers of peer pressure combined with social media."
" This is the best movie of all time!! You baby boomers just don't understand
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,10,"This movie is the best!! OMG it is soo good. You just got to watch it. This is literally the best movie I have seen in a while. It beats anything else out there for sure. Dave Franco and Emma Roberts are amazing. I'm not gonna ruin it for you, but basically they are playing this game and the thing about this game is that it is just really fun. You just got to see it, this movie is soo amazing OMG!! But on the flip side, if you are a grandma or a baby boomer, you are not gonna like this movie, and that is understandable. This movie is much better than the ratings suggest because the baby boomers have rated it down. But don't be tricked, this really is a great movie"
" Good movie, Something new from this era
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,7,"This movie promises a fun and exciting vibe when you see them doing these dares. It makes you join the actors in their journey to full fill them dares.Good acting, Good FX, Good story, which i wouldn't come up with on the fly.The story itself is good, the writer of this story tries to tell you that you can pretend and follow the crowd behind a mask but if you are known without a mask and confronted in real life you wouldn't be doing such things.The story lets you get introduced to some of the main characters except Ian, you get to know a little bit about him when the story progresses.It's an interesting movie, so check it out!"
" Until it's not as bad as I imagined
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"Nerve was a movie that I did not carry any faith, but I surprised myself, The film still I think medium, but I expected a movie a lot Bad, fortunately he is not, the movie starts well, but it gets weak Not in time, I found it from the middle of the second act that the Directors began to lose the hand of the film, the film began to A mess, the script that is no longer so good, starts to get bad, and Some dialogues are very dull, the premise is interesting, more is Poorly executed in the film, the cast is interesting, and the Emma Roberts' chemistry with Dave Franco until it works, plus the The actions are average to bad, and I did not like the ending, Nerve has a Good premise, more is poorly executed, more until the film is better than Which I expected. Note 6.4"
" Learning to hold your nerve
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,5,"'Nerve' is one of those films that quietly went under the radar at the cinema, but seem to catch on via word of mouth.Truth is it's a decent film, inspired by a YA book. It also acts as a vehicle for up and coming talents such as Emma Roberts and Dave Franco, who both give good performances.Roberts in particular shines in every scene, and it is her character of Vee who goes through the biggest journey throughout.The plot doesn't hold up to much scrutiny, but it is an action packed film, that proves entertaining.If you can stomach the fact that it's really just people doing lots of irresponsible things then you'll enjoy the film. Parents thinking of letting their teens watch it should be wary though."
" A Crazy and Dangerous 92 minute crime thriller.
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,"Nerve is a real classic. A really good film with a good premise. In Nerve, Emma Roberts stars as a young woman whom is in talked by her snobbish best friend (Emily Meade) into playing an online truth and dare game, which players are dared into pulling crazy and dangerous stunts, which they win prize money. But, she soon finds her life in danger when she crosses paths with a another player (Dave Franco) and soon learns the terrible truth behind the game and she becomes manipulated by the people behind it and the challenges and the stunts become more and more dangerous. The film reminded me of Crank starring Jason Statham and it reminded me of the Stephen King novel The Running Man. Some of the stuff the main characters do in the film were downright Ludicrous and dangerous. It was one of those films which keeps you guessing about what is going happen next. Emma Roberts gives an outstanding performance and Emma Roberts and Dave Franco have good on-screen chemistry. The editing and the pacing is sensational. The film had good visual effects and the soundtrack is superb. The film has a good message and it teaches us about the dangers of online gaming and social media. All in all, Nerve is a really good film, if you enjoyed films such as Crank, Saw, Run Lola Run, Gamer, The Game and Turkey Shoot, than I highly recommend Nerve."
