",2021-03-22 00:00:00,9,"The way of Describe Juvenile of the scenes is makes me gives the movie good ratings, it's amazing!!, and the cast do well too"
" Worthwhile watch.
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,6,Enjoyable in that it isn't a difficult watch. Something to put on and relax and enjoy. Enjoyed Jonah Hill's wild character. Funny stuff.
" enjoyable
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,5,Enjoyable. but the voiceover by miles teller was annoying. not a movie i'd watch again but enjoyed it while watching
" Jonah Hill is fat again
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,6,"An odd but enjoyable film
Just strange
Don't know how to explain it
They become gun runners but are really unlikeable"
" ""This is about being pro-money!""
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,7,"I watched the movie and still can't believe it's based on a true story! How these two guys with no background or expertise managed to become big time, international arms dealers is beyond comprehension. Now I've seen Jonah Hill in a number of vehicles but never this huge, that was rather shocking. This was my first look at Miles Teller, he had a nice All-American look, but both guys looked so young to pull off what they were doing that it defied belief. The biggest disconnect occurred late in the film when it was stated that it would take fifty men eight weeks to repack a hundred million rounds of Chinese ammunition to sell back to the United States government. But then Efraim (Hill) didn't pay the box guy the paltry hundred grand that he asked for! That right there demonstrated what a creep Efraim was, when he stood to rake in millions on the contract. Besides the fact he was going to screw his partner. And then he only got a four year prison sentence while Dave Packouz got merely a seven month house arrest! Just goes to show, if you want to screw the government and pretty much get away with it, do it in as big a way as possible."
" Pretty bad
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,3,I lose faith in ratings when I see this movie is maintaining a 7+ rating. It's a joke
" Solid Film, Much Better then I was expecting
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,9,Usually these types of films leave you bored. This one really caught my interest.
" Wow
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,9,This movie is amazingly funny and thrilling Jonah hill is one of the best comedy actors ever.
" Entertaining and eye-opening
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,8,"Things I liked: Jonah hill's laugh and performance, the story is crazy, and the soundtrack matches the film.Things I didn't like: miles teller's performance was uninspired compared to whiplash."
" Good movie but not a comedy
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,8,"Good story, good acting and some funny lines, but not a comedy by any stretch of the imagination. That said, seems worth watching."
" Good movie
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,8,"Good flick, enjoyed every pert of it. Great story, great acting - Jonah Hill was excellent as usual and the sound track was excellent. Definitely enjoyed it."
" Interesting concept
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,6,"An interesting story, which tells a different side of war than what's typically depicted. Decent acting and cinematography. not sure about the narration style, felt choppy."
" Damn this was sad
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,4,"This script was sooooo flaaaaat. Boring characters, empty performances, completely mondane."
" Solid movie
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,7,"Although this is based on a real story, my only issue is there's a lot of exaggerated Hollywood spins on things. But regardless, it was a fun and entertaining movie thats definitely worth the watch"
" NOT to be confused or compared to Chris Walken's Great DOGS OF WAR
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,5,"Opposite ends of the spectrumYet another retread of behind the scenes arms dealing, this one a dramedy (minus comedy), based on a boring, I mean True, Boring storyThe proper formula of cliche's is key to general audience reception, and here all the cliche's practically fall like an endless row of dominoes on an infinite moebus strip, with barely enough time between each to recover your breath, awestruck at the level of mediocrity.annoying
Even the great comedic actor Jonah Hill can't get water out of his millstonr of a rude, crude, no bs Non-observant Jewish stereotype. Actually Jonah does get some slime off the rock and do this boring stereotype with an actor's professional level journeyman's effort to assure his burnished, unblemished place as one of The Great Actors on FilmHi-point? Jonah screaming across the rooftops of Bagdhad, like a muezzin calling all the faithful to prayer: ""I'm in a muslim country and can't get a b---j!""That's it, Folks, and all downhill from there"
" A good film to watch with the boys
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,9,"On Monday evening, I watched War Dogs in its entirety for the first time. A feature of the movie that stood out to me was Jonah Hill's acting. He was effective at portraying a friendly, lighthearted character in the beginning but eventually transitioned into an angry and spiteful person. I paid close attention to the camera angles utilized during certain moments of the film. I noticed that in tense situations the camera would zoom in to better capture the actor's expressions or the lights would darken to heighten suspense. I think a main message from the movie is that money does not necessarily bring happiness as their lives unravel as their business grows. Overall, War Dogs was entertaining and had a strong cast performance."
" Most unrealistic movie ever
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,7,Am I suppose to believe that a loser massage therapist's girlfriend is Ana De Armas? So unrealistic.
" Who Let the Dogs Out
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,5,"Jonah Hill! Miles Teller! Other Stuff!This was a wholly forgettable experience for me. I was drawn in by the promise of Hill and Teller being gun runners and that sounds like a good time but this whole thing just felt so blah. It's good at points, really boring at others. It didn't feel like it did anything exceptionally well. I suppose the best way to explain this is that I watched this maybe 3 days ago? Don't really remember anything about it. It's just super generic, it's all pretty obvious what's coming. Our two leads are decent here but overall this just sort' expectations exists.Worth a glance if you can catch it streaming but would not recommend spending money on this."
" Amazing Movie!
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,9,"Drama, suspense, action. You wouldn't believe this was based on a true story!
Must See!"
" Its a STRONG 6
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,6,"The movie is okay, bit not bad. based on a real story!"
" Better than I thought.
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,7,"Even when Jonah Hill is an amazing actor, I wasn't very eager to watch him play an obnoxious character... again, however, Todd Phillips achieves to show this difficult subject in a very funny way.Everything's fine but not outstanding."
" Watchable
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,6,"I am not the biggest fan of Jonah Hill because he kinda gets similar roles all the time, and this move is not really an exception. But he plays it well and the rest of the cast is also quite proficient.The story itself is okay. Sometimes predictable, a few small plot holes and stupidities here and there rounding up quite well towards the end.Don't expect it to be very surprising if you know most of Lord Of War, Wolf of Wall Street, Moneyball, but not a time waste."
" Very enjoyable story and Jonah Hills laugh makes worth watching even better!
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,"Such a smooth highly entertaining story about gun runners/business. I originally saw in the theater that was a blast plus wasn't reviewing then. The voice over by Miles Teller is so great, the amount f bombs Jonah Hill uses are glorious, soundtrack is incredible, writing is superb, cinematography is beautiful and the bit of comedy is delightful! War Dogs should've at least won an award that year, definitely deserves it!"
" cool movie with good acting
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,9,"I've seen it probably a dozen times and look forward to seeing it every time it's on HBO.It's really a badass movie. Cool story, good writing, and good acting.Bradley Cooper has a smaller role, but a pretty good one. Jonah Hill and Miles Teller are so good together, they could be best friends in real life. They sold it. And the thing that also works is how Jonah's character knows more than Miles' character -- the writing brought that out well.I want to read this script, because it feels like a page turner. It's hard to pull yourself away from this movie. There's a lot of exciting scenes and I didn't want to take a break to go to the bathroom, I didn't want to miss anything.I was trying to think of why I didn't give it a 10 and I guess I felt it was inferior to Scarface (the movie they love in this movie). It's like Boiler Room trying to be as good as Wall Street.One thing I'd change about the movie is I wish he'd shot the guy who pocketed his 300 bucks, even if he just clipped his kneecap to cripple him and get his cash back. Not that he needed it, but it's the principle of the matter."
" What a life. Want it.
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,8,"SYNOPSIS:
Based on a true story, David (Miles Teller), gets reunited with his old friend, Efraim (Jonah Hill), who reels him into the world of arms dealing. The rush of making big money causes David to take a big risk with Efraim that he's not comfortable with.REVIEW:
This is one of those films that I consider wildly underrated. Not because people don't give it the props that it deserves, but because when you bring up lists like ""Best of the Past Decade,"" people don't really bring up this film.There's something about a film that immediately comes off as intellectual, that really draws me in. I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks this way, but from the very opening scene I got that vibe from this film. The narration from Miles Tiller as he's just breaking down a gun that's in front of him and starts to bring you to the numbers (sorry math haters). It's shows a true direction of the writing and right off the bat tells the viewer, ""hey, you better keep up."" I'm not saying that you'll be confused, but the pace of the film is asking the viewer to keep your eyes on. If you start slow or too much ""action"", let's say, either way those two directions can lose someone's interest right away or be too much for someone to take in right away. With War Dogs, there's a little bit of suspense and a little bit of story telling that doesn't hold you for too long to where you're starting to not care. The acting you get from both Teller and Hill is stellar, but the clear standout is Jonah Hill. A large portion of the film almost comes off like it's directed by Efraim. It has this egotistical style with analytics, fast tempo, and look-at-how-I-turned-this-poor-masseuse-into-a-big-baller style. And just like the Efraim character in the film, when the direction feels that way, it's far more interesting. You get caught up like how David gets caught up.If you're looking for a solid film from beginning to end that will literally keep you interested in what's going to happen next all the way through, this is a great film for you. Superb acting, beautifully paced, and impressively funny/suspensful. 8.5/10."
" Directed by same Director directed The Joker
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,8,Director Todd Phillips applies the same techniques in War Dogs as well in The Joker.Thus is Ana de Armas fourth American film in Hollywood followed by Knock Knock with Keanu Reeves and Ecposed with Keanu Reeves and Hands of Stone with Robert DeNiro. She's the the Latina girlfriend of Miles Teller and later she becomes pregnant with him during the film they get married. He works with Jonah Hill who has been making the wrong decisions that left them to be investigated by the FBI and setup by their friend who was wired. He made a deal with the FBI for a lesser sentence. Miles Teller comes to Bradley Cooper to find out what happened since he is not an expert in firearms he couldn't tell from defective ammunition to non-defective he gets a percentage of the deal from Bradley Cooper at the end. Miles Teller is revealed to be playing a Latin person Munoz when Miles Teller is an American.
" Jonah Hill shines
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,9,"War Dogs is a type of crime film you have certainly seen before, but what makes it so enjoyable at times, is the talent behind it, even if they can't make it quite as unique as the story they are telling. Miles Teller and Jonah Hill star alongside each other as the leads of this film, and both do a fantastic job, namely Hill who is as good as ever. Hill, besides playing a sociopathic character throughout the film very well, also gained almost 50 pounds for the role, which is not only astonishing, but also very impressive. The film is directed by Hangover and Old School director Todd Phillips, who would also come to direct one of my personal favorite flicks, Joker in 2019. His direction is on point in this film, but I do feel like the overall tone of the flick seems to mimic others of a similar genre and subject matter, and I just wish it was a bit more memorable. The pacing can also be a bit slow at times, notably more so towards the conclusion, but for the most part, the film can be amusing, and solidly interesting through and through. Bradley Cooper also provides a small, but very notable performance throughout the film as Henry Girard, and I was also a fan of the soundtrack throughout the flick, with its nostalgic taste in tunes, as well as its often admirable cinematography. In the end, War Dogs is not the most original crime flick out there, but it certainly has a few impressive tricks up its sleeve, and for most, it is worth the casual viewing it seems to desire.
My Rating: 9/10"
" Truth is stranger than fiction.
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,5,"A brash loud mouthed entrepeneurd Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill) recruits old friend David Packouz (Miles Teller) into his arms dealing business and base themselves in Miami. David is a massage therapist and wants to settle down to a family life with his wife (Ana de Armas), but Efraim seduces him down another path to make money to help him pay off his debts. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq prove to be very lucrative for them as they sort of legitmately buy arms off fallen regimes around the world to sell on to the US military. They believe they have a windfall when they are offered warehouses of arms and millions of shells in Albania.They say that truth is stranger than fiction and WAR DOGS is the very epitomy of this. The basis of the film is Guy Lawson's 'Rolling Stone' article about how two twenty-somethings with no military experience become big time arms dealers in war zones and in the film uses Teller's character as the narrator of his own unbelievable story. The scenes in Iraq are the funniest and equally the scariest situation to be in. Hill for once is wonderful in his excess and with his SCARFACE obsessed character is the driving force behind the energy of the film. At times though the film feels like director Todd Phillips can't decide whether to go down a more Scorsese/GOODFELLAS path or the comedy of his own HANGOVER films."
" A blast
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,9,"Packed with great moments, a clever screenplay, fast pacing and incredible direction; War Dogs is a 2 hours of nonstopping ride."
" Exciting, funny, and illegal
",2020-07-21 00:00:00,8,"The movie starts off narrated, interesting and very cohesive. They do a great job of introducing characters and foreshadowing what is later to come. The characters are very well developed and their relationship especially at the start is funny and light hearted. The acting is great if you like films like ""superbad"" and ""neighbour's"".The plot itself is based off a true story and is really interesting from start to finish. The action is great with slight comedy here and there. It has very wolf of wall street vibes and is a thrill ride.When Bradley Cooper gets involved there is a lot of mystery and suspense. You really don't know whats gonna happen and your interest becomes even greater. The contract part was extremely predictable. The ending was very weird, without spoiling it, someone goes to jail for what seems a really short amount of time considering the crime. Then someone gets given money which is somewhat satisfying. But you really don't get a feeling of revenge or justice.Summary:
Overall I was really surprised at how good this was. Its not just your average comedy. It has great characters, acting, story, and is a blast to watch. Highly recommended."
" felt like a knock off version of lord of war
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,6,"I found the movie pretty easy to watch, i was mostly invested all the way through .the acting was okay ,but it seemed like a knock off of lord of war . i know it's ""based"" on a true story but the whole plot was pretty similar . maybe there isn't much else you can do with a gun runners plot ... overall i found it okay. i could pick on a few clichè moments throughout i could rag on but this film wasnt ever trying to to be a masterpiece it's pretty basic at best . worth a watch to kill a few hours"
" War Dogs
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,5,"I saw where this movie was going in the first 15 minutes, but War Dogs still found a way to be an over the top good time, with enjoyable leads, and a fun soundtrack."
" Solid biopic
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,8,"If you like movies like The Preppie Connection (2015) or Tom Cruise's American Made (2017) then you should like War Dogs. It's a well made movie with a great script. It seems natural and uncontrived, and has an ever more tense arc that delights. Seeing as it's all probably true, I can't see how anyone wouldn't enjoy War Dogs.By the way, here in Australia The Preppie Connection is marketed as The Cocaine Connection."
" Best movie of the year
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,10,"One of the best biography movie of all time , regardless of negative action of what they did , movie is a good inspiration sample of how you can get success in very early age by doing your own business, best acting best story happy to watch it this evening"
" yeah, pretty enjoyable, but wouldn't say it's a comedy
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,7,"War Dogs is a movie about down on luck David Packouz (Miles Teller) and his childhood friend Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill). Diveroli is a small arms dealer, taking the ""crumbs"" of weapons contracts from the military. Diveroli asks Packouz to partner with him and the two slowly move up, only to take a big jump in status with a risky arms trade to the US military in Iraq. With a nice gulp of success, they decide to stop with the crumbs and eat the whole pie with a 100 million AK-47 bullet order. Things come crashing down as Diveroli becomes greedier and angrier.It's weird that this movie is tagged as a comedy/crime/biography. The comedy elements completely failed as I don't recall any memorable moments. If anything, it got in the way of the story.But the story is interesting, suspenseful where it needs to be. Jonah Hill does an excellent job as playing a greasy slimeball type of guy -- a used car salesman stereotype that you wouldn't trust and didn't like, but know that he'd get the job done. Packouz is the scarier character in that he seemed to have the morals that Diveroli lacked, but, because he was poor and a soon to be father, probably saw Diveroli as a godsend. Had Packouz been a bit better off, he probably wouldn't have even considered Diveroli's offer. Indeed, Diveroli might have offered the partnership because he knew Packouz was down on his luck.Some things seem hard to believe, but given it's based on a true story and I don't know the true story, I don't know what was truth, what was exaggeration, or what was completely made up. But I did enjoy the ride.Yeah, this type of movie has been done before (Blow, Lord of War, Wolf of Wall Street), but I don't think this was trying to be a novel concept. It told a story of something that actually happened, and for that, it did it well. I did think Lord of War was far better, and only bring that movie up in case someone liked War Dogs and was looking for something similar."
" Absolute nonsense
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,2,"If you are expecting a Jonah Hill version of Lord of War (2005), then this is not it.War Dogs is like an energy drink commercial, aimed at thirsty twelve year olds. Plenty of clueless ego swagger, cultural reinforcement that has nothing to do with anything, and a pretty girl who is just a convenient stereotype. The only thing ""true"" about this film is that guns exist, and people sell them. What a stinker.One extra star because Jonah's character almost had discernible personality."
" Ughhh

" Good! But but great! Casting mishap.
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,7,"I LOVE Jonah Hill! However, it was Bradley Cooper that should have had his role and Jonah the ""apprentice."" Whoops."
" Better than I expected.
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,8,"War Dogs is based on a true story where two twenty somethings sell arms back to the US government. Jonah Hill and Mills Teller put up a great performance, they made the story very appealing. The storyline had plenty of connections with Scarface, from locations to tag lines. It was a good movie with a great cast. Definitely worth watching."
" Good watch, not stellar but worthwhile
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,7,"Another one of those so-wild-but-true-story movies. War Dogs is mix of Wolf of Wall Street and Scarface sprinkled with comedy.Though War Dogs is lovable, it presents nothing new to the table. The film is more interested in keeping us entertained than informing us. The movie is a lot of guns and moneyporn. Jonah Hill does his part as the funny chubby guy.3.5/5. Above average and enjoyable but not worth a 4/5 or higher."
" GUNS, GUNS & More GUNS

",2020-01-16 00:00:00,8,Interesting movie considering it to being a true story.
" An incredible story, beautifully shot, but short of originality.
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,8,"For the sake of showcasing how f'ed-up the national defense budget really is, this film certainly does the job and it definitely deserves a viewing but how close can you get to Wolf of Wall Street without looking like it's little brother? It has a great soundtrack, Lawrence Sher is a master pro and Todd Phillips never disappoints to entertain an audience. It's a great thrill ride and a buddy film demonstrating how greed will do you in if you subcome to a bite of the apple."
" Like a less intelligent 'Lord Of War'
",2019-12-12 00:00:00,2,"Much like 'American Made' and 'Atomic Blonde,' this also mismatches the cast and turns what should be a drama into an action film with the wrong feel to it. Miles Teller looks like a boy scout. The attempt at irony and juvenile sarcasm that was present in L.O.W. in a sort of narrative style of the very dry delivery of Nick Cage was poorly copied in this turd."
" Heavy but Realistic

" Phillips' post-Galifianakis, pre-Phoenix picture
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,6,"Right now it seems if you don't have an opinion on Todd Phillips' DC foray you're either dead or Joaquin Phoenix. Having not seen Joker hasn't stopped anyone from offering an opinion to date but journalistic integrity (and frugality and laziness) has driven me to explore Todd Phillips' back catalogue available on Netflix before attending a picture theatre and subsequently diving head first into spurious debate about his latest effort.With titles such as The Hangover (2009) and Due Date (2010), Phillips has previously shown that he can point a camera at Zach Galifianakis. But how would he fair with the Galifianakis-free, true(ish) story of two young arms dealers who hustle their way into a major contract with the Pentagon in War Dogs?Taking a lesser-told story from a secretive industry can be both a blessing and a curse. If we take the main reason we watch films as being 'catharsis' which necessitates empathy with a protagonist and the second reason as being 'to watch something we've never seen before', an inherent problem with ambitious cinema can be that of how to tackle exposition.In tackling this problem, Phillips tries to balance a sympathetic 'everyman' protagonist-come first person narrator with that character's willingness to engage in nefarious acts. And thus the film effectively falls at the first hurdle. While we can all empathise with a young family's desire for stability driving as it does to make money ""between the lines"", moral lines can surely be drawn somewhere soon after the first few million dollars are achieved.Yet the fact that our protagonist has an extreme change of heart late into the Third Act, having been previously complicit in all dubiousness and duplicity which amounted to the films tensions and therefore main entertainments left a sour taste.
While technique, including Fight Club inspired-text-labels for weapons costs sustains the early part and subsumes the necessary exposition, the film's pace drags as it deals with manufactured moral dilemmas now minute in comparison with the margins in which its protagonists are continually working.War Dogs is not without quality. Its cast is adept and its subject matter alone is almost enough to sustain it. However, its reliance on the (non-existent) 'everyman' qualities of its lead protagonist are essentially what diminish this quality."
" worth watching
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,8,"I can not describe the film in words, but this story with all its ups and downs shows how bad friends influence and how we should investigate well in choosing a friend"
" Charismatic and fun
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,7,"""Dogs of War"" is a fast, shrewd and straightforward long, much like the work of Adam Mckay, young director Todd Phillips has no qualms about telling his story or developing his characters, both things that are well done, coupled with a great mixing and soundtrack plus a pair of charismatic protagonists the feature is a stamp of success.The script is simple, its development even more, the whole plot is fleeting, and we do not feel the weight of its consequences, the characters have a good development and the acts are very well defined, we even have the call of the hero, simplicity works, but it does not enchant.The greatest enchantment is the direction, not because it is excellent or exquisite, but because it is so much fun, abusing the editing and the soundtrack coupled with a fast camera and strong colors. Todd Phillips manages to hold the viewer to his work, and make The same laugh and tense, but much more for the absurdity than the quality itself, is a mangy style but we like to see, especially when it is well done, which is the case here.""Dogs of war"" has a great pair of well-functioning protagonists who have chemistry with each other, the cast is good, the art direction and technique is good, although it doesn't bring news or originality the movie is exciting and fun."
" Interesting story with a touch of Hollywood
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,8,"A very entertaining Wolf of Wall Street like movie with a weapon selling twist. I realized some of the things were Hollywoodized in order to make the movie less ""just making deals over the phone""; after reading up on the real life events that the movie is inspired from. Jonah Hill does a great job. I like that guy.Two childhood friends buy weapons from around the world and sell them to the US army for profit."
" Wolf of Wall Street with guns
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,8,"Here's my review of "" war dogs "" , so war dogs is this story about two childhood friends who team up and become illegal arms dealers for the penatagon aka war dogs , this movie has so many funny jokes as well as one liners from Jonah hill and this guy stole the show inspite of Bradley cooper being a part of the movie .miles teller did a good job too , but Jonah hill got the upper hand and his one liners were so funny like "" hold your tummy and laugh "" kind of funny and the supporting characters were good followed by a great screenplay and great dialogues ,I couldn't find anything bad about it , as soon as as the movie started , it didn't waste time on setting up characters and it jumped right to the plot within a few minutes.During the movie I felt as if I've seen these jokes and the cinematic touch somewhere and I realised that the movie was directed by Todd Phillips , the director of the hangover trilogy and that explains why Bradley cooper was a part of it and during the credits I noticed that he's the one who did the casting. So in the end , war dogs isn't kaboom ,kapoosh and bomb blasts ,its a solid entertainer with lots of laughter , relatable characters and an old school moral to not be greedy and just like will smith said "" don't lose focus "" you'll know what I mean ,once you finish watching the movie."

" Teller and Hill showing talent beyond their years
",2019-06-11 00:00:00,7,"Without the lead duo, War Dogs wouldn't be much more than an unusual tale dressed up for the big screen; fortunately, the casting is immaculate. Before seeing this, I would have placed Miles Teller (Whiplash, Fantastic Four) in the category of my least favourite actors (a mixture of public persona and previous films), but he has obviously matured since his earlier performances into an actor with quality range. However, Jonah Hill (Superbad, Wolf of Wall Street) is the unleashed personality of the film - a brash personality with expensive taste and an iconic laugh like no other.The storyline follows the leads trying to pave their way into the international arms industry, moving from small-fry deals to bidding on the biggest international contracts. David (Teller) tries to juggle work alongside his pregnant and strongly anti-war girlfriend, whilst Efraim (Hill) drags him deeper into the murky waters of war. The dark horse for me is Bradley Cooper's Henry - a brilliant portrayal of a man who has already crossed ethical lines trying to make money, giving the duo a glimpse of what their futures could end up being.Oddly enough, the soundtrack is one of the most refined cinema has had in years: every track selection captures the scene perfectly, no mean feat given the potential for nearly any scene to morph from comedic to gravely serious. The accompanying scenes of both over-the-top brashness and flaunting of wealth across the globe perfectly captures the public image of arms dealers, making War Dogs an enjoyable romp through the lives of those living off war's inevitability."
" Distorted information
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,3,This movie does not represent the truth for Albania. It will be good if they do a research for it before representing this distorted information to the public. Even if it is just a movie they dont have the right to discriminate a country like this.
" Implausible and awkward portrayal of the real-life story
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,2,"While both of the leads (Miles Teller and Jonah Hill) make an unlikely pair, the unusual career field they find themselves in seems even more unlikely. Admittedly knowing next to nothing about the arms business or military contracts, the two somehow prove quick studies and soon find they're in way over their heads (lowest bidders in a multi-million dollar contract to supply millions of rounds of ammunition to the US Department of defense).""War Dogs"" is based on a true story, so we know that part happened. What is never explained is how two such bumblers could ever fool anyone to get themselves in such an unlikely situation...Miles Teller takes a backseat to Jonah Hill's mouthy character, and seeing the idiotic way Hill handles his first foray into ""arms sales"" would make anybody thinking about doing business with these two, make tracks in the opposite direction. Hill's character is a braggart, a loudmouth, and far too over-confident in situations that get increasingly implausible as the movie progresses. Hill's character exudes all the competence of a chimp with a gun as he makes bigger and bigger arms deals and instantly turns himself into a clownish figure that NO. ONE in their right mind would buy a box of pencils from - let alone several million dollars worth of ammo.Given a real-life backstory that was ripe for parody, or at least satire, this movie could have been something else entirely then it really is - an absurd, unrealistic, and mawkish story about a couple of real idiots who happened to get very lucky."

" A Totally Cool And Deep Movie With Very Few Flaws
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,9,"Much like Lord of War, War Dogs is about an American arms dealer, or rather, two of them. While Lord of War explores it's protagonist's background somewhat, War Dogs doesn't bother wasting your time with that boring stuff. In one scene, Jonah Hill's character is ripped off by a drug dealer, so he pulls out a really big gun and fires it loudly in broad daylight in a highly developed area, like a total boss, and the dealer and his friends all run away like total wimps. You realize right then that you're watching one of the best movies ever made.Jonah Hill and Miles Teller play the main characters perfectly. They were totally believable portraying two upper-middle-class American guys just going through the daily grind trying to make a few bands.Anyway, Jonah and Miles' characters like to smoke weed, but that costs money. Also, Miles' character has a hot girlfriend that he wants to keep. They realize that by exploiting US foreign policy, ineptitude and bureaucracy, they can get the best bud in all of Florida. By buying guns from old dudes in Bulgaria or whatever and reselling them to American guys they start to make a fortune.In one scene they're delivering a load of stuff in Fallujah, Afghanistan (or maybe it was Iran, idk) and the terrorists start to chase them. I was like woah, are they gonna get killed by the terrorists and the whole movie will suddenly end at 68 minutes? But no, the US army or maybe even the Marines showed up just in time to stop the terrorists, but the soldiers flick off Jonah and Miles' because they know, just like I did, that they're making the big bucks. I threw my vape down and shouted ""this is awesome"" in the theater when I first saw this scene.Bradley Cooper played the bad guy. He was this Russian or Arab guy who sold guns but was really uncool about it. In one scene his boys jumped Miles and threatened to cut off his d or something like that. He had no chill and said Jonah and Miles couldn't back out of the deal.Then they bought a bunch of Chinese bullets and resold them to the government but eventually the government found out and they got in trouble. It's illegal to buy and resell Chinese products for a profit if you're an arms dealer, but Jonah and Miles didn't know that, probably because they saw every major retailer in the country buying and reselling Chinese products for a profit.Eventually Miles and Jonah get into an argument because Miles says having the best bud in Florida isn't worth it. Jonah disagrees and says that all of Miles' money actually belongs to him. Miles' girl is really mad at him because he's been dodging her and fronting like he doesn't sell guns.This movie was the bomb. I told all of my friends that they should watch it. You should too."
" The Albanian woman asking for her missing husband spoke in Romanian!!
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,8,"I liked this movie. Kept me entertained. It had a good story line, humour and great actors!
I took two stars though as I was disappointed to see that when one of the main characters was in Albania, there was a woman that spoke in Romanian AND as a Romanian, made me wonder if Romanian language is supposed to be considered the language that is spoken in Albania..??!!!
I hope that the explanation could also be that the missing Albanian man was just married to a Romanian.. as otherwise: in Albania, people speak Albanian and in Romania people speak Romanian. I know! I'm Romanian!
Albania and Romania are two very different countries!"
" Entertaining fun for fans of Wolf of Wall Street or Catch Me If You Can
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,8,"That laugh... Even better than Jonah Hill's teeth in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"".I really enjoyed this film. It was well-paced, had some laughs, good use of tension and action, with Hill and Teller having a good dynamic too.Pretty crazy that it was a true story - the US seems to have (or at least had) an insane system. Would be nice if one of these rags to riches story actually had a happy ending, but I guess that's life.Ana de Armas is in this movie too. Who? Yeah, I didn't know who she was prior to watching this, but now I want to book a ticket to Cuba, a destination not even in the movie. Stunningly attractive with excellent acting chops too.If you like ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" or ""Catch Me If You Can"" then you'll probably enjoy this. ""War Dogs"" is an easy-to-watch film that kept me entertained throughout!"

" Pleasantly Surprised! Very Entertaining!
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,9,"Not a huge explanation or anything, but I was surprised, although the movie is rated decent, I found it to be much more enjoyable than the ratings suggest.
Spoilers below
A slight critique. The wife used in the movie is way too hot. I'm down for hot chicks in movie roles, but that chick is supernaturally hot, thus giving it an unnecessary fake vibe. Don't get me wrong, I'll take fairy tale wife over something like Point break for instance where we have to pretend that Keanue Reeves is madly into this chick who is unbangable to the vast vast majority of the population.The info below is just ramble about the actual actions of those involved, rather than any critique's pertaining to the movie.
Aside from Efrain's insane lack of ethics (to say the least), the only thing slightly criminal was selling Chinese ammunition to the US government and disguising it as Albanian or Russian ammo. I theorize the US government was fine being in the dark as to the actual point of origin, but was forced to react when the man heading the workers in charge of repacking all the bullets got stiffed and outed them. I wouldn't be surprised if the US gov. organized it in the first place, however, since when is the government trying to cut down on spending, so who knows?I take these shows based on true events with a grain of salt, however all of the points that check out make this Effraim guy about as shady of a human being as one can get. Cutting the Albanian workers out of their money is biggest example as to just how bad of a person this Effraim dude is, but to cut your partner out of his 30% and to cut the dozens of workers who slaved to repackage the bullets for however many weeks over a measly 100k (allowing you to make several million more) is beyond criminal. It's one of the worst things I've ever observed. I would have still been pissed if he only ended up paying him the 100k, which was such an insanely low amount as it was, but to stiff the workers is such a shady act and to stiff the workers was so painfully stupid. Oye Vey!
So, the way the movie ends is a mixed bag. I liked that David Packouz didn't have to do jail time and that the sweedish dude paid him his cut in the end (in real life Effraim kept all of the profits and they added Packouz getting a payday). Anways, not really a review, but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, but the level of crooked by the Effraim dude I found a bit disturbing. I don't even find killers as disturbing."
" gun runners

" A story, and little else.
",2018-10-24 00:00:00,6,"I'd been watching quite a few dark programmes on Primr and was desperately looking for some comedy, when I came across War Dogs. When it was over, I went looking for some comedy.It's the story of two people who sell arms. And it's the story of how they did it. I have no idea how true to life it is, but I do know that it's neither overly exciting as a story, nor funny besides some light-hearted moments of banter. I own the similar-.in basic concept- Lord of War and consider it to be a very good movie that I've already watched twice and definitely will again when I feel like it. War Dogs won't be getting a second viewing.There's nothing to hold my interest. I don't find the characters engaging. The relationship between them is not interesting and the story is weak. There is little tension, humour or any sense that this could be real- even though it was. By which I mean it all seems a bit lifeless.As a story, it works. I now know the basics of what happened whereas before, I didn't. In many respects, I wish I'd just watched a documentary and learned about it in less than half the time."
" No drama, no comedy
",2018-10-19 00:00:00,5,This's really boring movie. Theme is not enought explored by director. No empathy with characters because it's everything cliche. Not enought funny moments for comedy and too nonsensical for drama or good crime. You can live without watching it.
" Ideal career progression for a masseuse (almost)
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,7,"Jonah and Miles put up a great show in this latest Tod Phillips experiment. While it was very nice narration which made you laugh every now and then, I honestly have no great takeaways from this movie. It's just one of those movies that you can just watch on a boring Wednesday night. I did however like the part where they set up the premise for the upcoming segment like they would for a stage show"
" Performances elevate film
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,8,"War Dogs seemingly came and went, though the film wasn't a box office success like Todd Philips previous films, this film has a very different feel, in a good way and is entertaining throughout. Most specify the performances from both leads, especially Jonah Hill portraying a young character in which he has played similar before. For his reasons, the film elevates and feels better given the performance.Another reason as to why this film is quite entertaining is the subject matter, as it's rougly based on a true story, which is quite eye opening to us whom are unfamiliar to these type of elements. Although quite predictable within the end, War Dogs is still an engaging watch and better than expected."

Two Jewish guys decide they want a slice of this hot bullet time action, and hilarity ensues as they bungle their way from one deal to the next.It's all going well until they try to fill an order for 68 gazillion bullets, which requires an ill fated trip to the vile, backward hell hole of Albania, where the filthy Albanians have been stockpiling Cold War era 7.62mm ammo for the best part of a century. Suddenly everything goes to shit. Good times!Languages spoken: American, English, Albanian.I rate War Dogs at 26.64 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a hilarious 8/10 on IMDB."
" Bad taste

And if you film this in Romania and try to pass it as Albania, do a better job of it. At least try! You could not show recognizable buildings or licence plates. And I was offended by the fact that the only time someone spoke 'Albanian' (the woman looking for her husband) it was in fact Romanian. Make the minimum effort to have someone speak Albanian and do not offend other countries by your laziness."

" Entertaining but flawed
",2017-12-06 00:00:00,6,"War Dogs does its job of presenting its pretty unbelievable story in a pleasing time passing manner.With a stronger script and direction it could well have been a really good film. It just misses out, and I can't help feeling a decent script doctor could have worked wonders.It will keep you entertained, so it's well worth a watch, but you'll probably think ""why did they think that was a good idea"" a few too many times to elevate it above mediocre but worth watching status."
" Plot-Rich, Modern Fluffy Adventure

Anticipating modern fluff, I didn't pick apart the plot to the nth degree which could easily be done. I just went along for the ride which was fairly entertaining. Solid acting, a rather engaging and detailed plot and a smattering of humorous bits. The story is 'loosely' based on a true story of a couple young guys taking advantage of a under-publicized Federal Government program to send small defense contracts to 'the little guys'. Selling arms and shipping them where needed. They get in over their head by bidding on a large contract which required more coordination and within the country of conflict. Will they be able to manage the contract? How will they manage to navigate international business in dangerous area? Fun and easy with a few smirks and better than average for the genre."
" Arms Contracts Equal Bucks: Makes the Drug Trade Look Like a Lemonade Stand
",2017-10-19 00:00:00,8,"Recently on the television show ""American Greed"", the story of Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz trading firearms and ammo to the US government was showcased as a morality tale of greed beating out common or good sense. Although both were against the US-Iraq War, Doveroli and Packouz decided market profit eclipses domestic moralizing. The US government was at war, and there were people in the world who were going to profit by dealing arms and ammo to those engaged in the fighting. The dirty little secret about war: there are many who profit largely whenever a superpower goes to war. The kind of money made in arms dealing as compared to something like illegal drugs, makes the latter look like a few lemonade stands.David Packouz (Miles Teller) was a massage therapist and occasional seller of high-quality blankets to the elderly. He doesn't make great money at either endeavor. He chances to meet his former school buddy, Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill in an award-caliber performance) at a funeral. Diveroli has been in illegal drug trading, but has found a more lucrative market: dealing in used weaponry and selling to the most fanatical gun enthusiasts on the planet: the United States Military. They find used weapons at wholesale and then resell online and to the US Government. His small company was called AEY Inc.Because the US is at war in Afghanistan and in Iraq, there is a shortage of munitions supplies. Diveroli discovers there's a US website detailing hundreds of requests for munitions. With governmental approval, anyone can sell the munitions to the US Military. At first everything is on the up-and-up. But they are mainly getting the crumbs while the larger manufacturers are getting the bigger pieces. The crumbs are worth millions but the thing is, the larger contracts are worth in the hundreds of millions. They even get a silent partner/backer Ralph Slutsky (Kevin Pollack).At a conference on firearms in Las Vegas, Diveroli and Packouz learn they may be in over their heads as they can't compete with the large munitions companies. Until Packouz meets with the notorious arms dealer Henry Girard (Bradley Cooper). Girard tells the novices several pieces of information which in this business can turn into hefty profits. (While I don't always agree ""knowledge is power"" only ""potential power"", in this case, the first one with the map to the treasure could win) Firstly, there's a shortage of AK-47 ammunition, needed especially for the Afghan army in the Middle East. Secondly, Girard knows where he can procure a large quantity of 150 million rounds of ammunition. The last piece is that Girard can't do business with the US Federal government, probably because he broke trade regulations. (Girard is probably loosely based on Swiss arms dealer Heinrich ""Henri"" Thomet.) Girard proposes to the newbies that he will sell them the ammo he has access to. If AEY can broker the deal to sell 150 million rounds of ammo to the US government, the deal is potentially worth $2/round, in other words about $300 million. It will be the largest deal AEY has ever brokered. The question is: will the US government fork out hundreds of millions to two twenty-something arms traders who have been in business for less time than a typical baseball season?A thoroughly compelling film. Aspects are a bit like some of Martin Scorsese's offerings with voice-over and occasional freeze frame. The voice-over by Miles Teller helps us understand all the pieces of the arms-dealing world. Some aspects were fictionalized but many of the details of some of the deals are accurate, especially the one worth $300 million. All acting is solid, particularly Tellers as Packouz and Bradley as Girard. However, a fantastic and believable performance by Jonah Hill as the guiding force behind AEY. Definitely one of Hill's best acting performances. A fairly underrated film."

" Yet another take on American rags to riches success story formula
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,6,"Yet another spin of the greed is good / rags-to-riches American success story formula pioneered by Oliver Stone's 1987 classic Wall Street"", still heavily used by all the others. This is a true story about 20-something guys (Jonah Hill, Miles Teller) exploiting a little- known government initiative that allows small businesses to bid on U.S. Military contracts during the Iraq War. They begin raking in big money but soon get in over their heads. Also starring, Bradley Cooper, Ana de Armas, Kevin Pollak. This type of movies usually depend heavily on the coolness of the leading actors, and Hill + Teller surely is an exciting combo. Hill's work is especially noteworthy, giving the staple comedy actor a chance to create an unusually multifaceted character, a sociopathic narcissistic dude. War Dogs"" also has the typical weakness of this type of movie: underdeveloped final act. After taking their sweet time showing all about the humble beginning and rise to fame and fortune, the later events are shown in a hurry. Stuff happens because it has to happen, not because the story has evolved to this point naturally. Director Todd Phillips is known for moderately funny but not especially inventive mainstream comedies (Road Trip"", Old School"", 2004's Starsky and Hutch"", School for Scoundrels"", The Hangover"" trilogy, Due Date""). This is his first break from the mold, and surely a refreshing step in new direction. Like some of the best screen stories, ""War Dogs"" is not tied to a particular genre such as comedy or action or drama. It has a bit of everything which has always been one of the most attractive aspects of this type of rags to riches movies. By the way, the poster design is a parody of the iconic poster for mafia classic Scarface"", which is referenced throughout the film; also, Hill was born in 1983 when Scarface"" was released. I don't know if it's really important in some way. It's a solid way to spend nearly two hours, but there's a great number of movies of the same type already. Don't expect to remember it in the morning."
" Unlikely Arms Dealers
",2017-09-20 00:00:00,7,"Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill), David Packouz (Milles Teller) renew their friendship at a funeral in Miami. Packouz is working as a masseuse, a job he hates and Hill has started his own business after working for his uncle selling guns. Together they secure an almost 300 million contact with the US government to sell arms to the allies in Afganistan. Working with Henry, an arms dealer expert (Bradley Cooper), what could go wrong? Done as a comedy, but you can still learn quite a bit about arms deals and come away wondering, did these guys really do this? This film is based on a 2011 Rolling Stone Article, ""Arms and the Dudes,"" but as to what is actual, what is dramatized, or just outright fictional in this film, you might want to read the article first."
" Arms and the Men.
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,7,"Miles Teller, who looks and sounds a bit like John Cusack, is a nice Jewish young man, just trying to get along in Miami by giving massages and selling first-class sheets to the many old age homes. His wife, Ana de Armas, doesn't really care. But Miles' life course is full of bumps. He meets an old high school friend, plump Jonah Hill, who involves him in a money-making scheme selling armaments and ammunition to the US Army. Maybe some others. I was lost from time to time.Well, I'll tell you, the money rolls in. It rolls in in barrels, visible even through the cloud of smoke from all the weed they do. There are cascades of one hundred dollar bills. They drive Porches. And all those thousands of first-class sheets of Egyptian cotton that Miles had bought? He and Hill make a mountain of those boxes and jubilantly set fire to them. Their arms empire grows. It expands from two ambitious guys to a vast international group of shady characters. The flow chart turns murky. What the shady characters are doing is outside the box but apparently legal enough, though dangerous. Then they discover that some AK-47 ammunition, left over in Albania from the Cold War, was made in China. It's illegal to sell Chinese-made ammunition to the US Army. So they set about anxiously repackaging the millions of dollars worth of ammo, from heavy wooden crates to fiberboard boxes, which gets rid of the Chinese ideograms on the wooden boxes.But somebody squeals and one by one the organization is taken down by the FBI.This sound a little complicated, and it is, but we're helped along by Miles Teller's matter-of-fact narration. He tells us what's going on every step of the way, often during a freeze frame. There are overhead shots. There are vicious arguments with the wife. Hill, who is the springboard for all this chicanery, turns out to be a perfidious boss. There is judicious use of contemporary pop music from the likes of Crosby, Stills, and Nash. The deployment of cuss words is unfettered. One of Jonah Hills' previous performances was in ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" This could easily have been directed by Martin Scorsese. In fact, if you didn't know it wasn't, you might think it was. Perhaps it most closely resembles ""Casino"", with Jonah Hill in the Joe Pesci part -- the guy who just pushed a good thing too far. The structure also owes a lot to Scorsese's ""Goodfellows"", with Miles being taken up into illegal activities while explaining in the narration exactly how it works. One might call the movie ""The Wolf of Albania."" That's not bad. If you're going to steal from someone, steal from the best. And there are funny moments. Miles Teller and Jonah Hill are about to have an extremely important meeting with some US officials regarding a huge arms deal. The meeting will take place on the upper floor of a huge office building. They're nervous so they decide to get stoned before the tête-a-tête and they approach the meeting half wrecked. The duo walk down a long hall, their footsteps clicking loudly on the stone floor. Hill stops. ""Wait a minute. Does it sound to you like there are other people in this hall?"" Miles replies, ""Yes."" Okay, satisfied, they begin walking again.It may be imitation Scorsese but it's a good imitation. Brian De Palma's near constant imitation of Alfred Hitchcock became an irritation after a while, but as long as director Todd Phillips finds his own vision, sooner or later, I don't care. I enjoyed the hell out of it."
" Undelivering, scattershot true life dramatization
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,4,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the summer of 2005, David Packouz (Miles Teller) makes a living on Miami Beach, giving back massages to wealthy clients for peanuts. Then, at a family funeral, he crosses paths with Efram (Jonah Hill), a brash young guy of about the same age, whose made a killing by making online arms deals of depleted army stock that the US government no longer needs, and wants to bring him in on the deal. But as the boys delve deeper into this murky world, the risks get greater and everything conspires to fall apart around them.When it comes to war, and the politics and motivations behind it, we're living in a far more cynical, acutely self aware age, where people are no longer falling for the jingoistic, stirring rhetoric used to whip up support for it, and can see beneath the surface of what it's about just fine. And so a different type of film emerges, in the shape of War Dogs, where our heroes aren't rounded, noble figures, but shady, arrogant ba$tards who are really operating behind the scenes. Sadly, despite the potential, the film isn't the soaring hit it should have been.Director Todd Phillips seems to have a background in mainstream comedy films, including The Hangover series, and while this is billed as a comedy itself, the darker tone and more uneasy subject matter make it harder to see in this way. Performances wise, Hill has never played his obnoxious American arsehole act to such great effect, making his Wolf of Wall Street character practically Paddington Bear, whilst Teller provides fine support as the slightly more restrained other guy. There is a neat sense of style, savvy Goodfellas style narration and some cool dramatic moments, but none of it comes off in quite as coherent and satisfying a manner as one would have hoped.If you want a film with a morally conflicted protagonist making a killing during war time, Lord of War with Nicolas Cage (which, ironically, was released in the year the film is set) is a more satisfying option. **"
" A great interesting take on an interesting subject
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,8,"This was a film I unfortunately missed last year even though I really wanted to watch it and now I have and I really enjoyed this film. The premise of this film sees two 22 year old men get into the world of arms dealing and slowly get over there heads. Miles teller plays the lead in this film and he does a great job in the film, he is easily the most likable character in this film but he also has the best development of anybody in this film to make you care about his predicament. Jonah hill plays his loudmouth best friend and he fit the role pretty perfectly. He was entertaining to watch and there chemistry is really good but when he needs to be unlikeable he does a really good job of selling that. Bradley cooper is in this film in a smaller role as an arms dealer and he was typically really good in his role, even though it isn't a huge role. I also really liked the performance of Teller's characters girlfriend who gave a strong performance to sell there relationship. The story of the film is pretty fascinating as you go on the journey with these guys and learn the arms dealer industry with teller which helps with connecting with the character. All the twists and turns feel appropriate for the situations that these characters are put in due to there profession. The script has some pretty great humour in it, hill and teller have great chemistry when it comes to there humorous dialogue. However, especially towards the third act I feel like the drama could have been more heated and it doesn't really hit the emotion that you need it to. The style of the film shows this industry as a cool lavish lifestyle and it makes you understand why these characters would find this lifestyle such an appeal. However, this film gets a little ridiculous towards the end and it just isn't as interesting as I found the first hour of the film to be. Overall this is a great fun film that should be seen because of just how cool it is."
" Pretty sure I've seen this before...
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,3,"I'm not going to harp on about this movie much, just go and watch Lord Of War (2005) and you'll enjoy it more than this movie (thank me later). This movie lacks any major character development (beyond that they like drugs and making money) and it's so boring in its presentation that I was just waiting for the moment they would eventually get caught. The acting is not up to much either, basically cut them their cheques and move on. Jonah Hill just plays the same role he's been doing for about 10 years now and it's getting a little boring. You can tell he's got some skills, such as in Moneyball but we just never really get to see it. Anyway, the true story of War Dogs is far more interesting and amazing and is worth looking up."
" Dead Serious Humor
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,8,"It's hard to write a review on this film without also making a spoiler or two, but I'll try hard not to. In stead I'll recommend to check out the true story about Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, but I'm not shore if you should do it before or after watching the biographical fiction version, that is some kind of a comedy. The true story is hilarious, but it's really not at all funny. In the fiction there is one bad and one good guy, though in my beliefs there are no good guys in arms dealing. To avoid the spoiling I won't say who is who, but must warn, if you read the true story, it may be a spoiler any how. The film about the two youngsters getting into hard core arms dealing is made as a black comedy, and because it's based on a real life story, it emerges as dead serious humor at its very best. With steady direction, brilliant acting and a half documentary style both in how camera and locations are used, and also top notch casting in the other roles, the total result is a film and story even Guy Ritchie couldn't match. If so, he would be proud. There are more than one over all issues of moral to the story. First, don't get into something you absolutely can't control and have no experience with. Second, maybe one day you have to discover that even your best friend turns out to be one of your worst enemies - at least if you get in to serious business with big boys and hard cash. Third and most important, war is big business, perhaps the biggest and your government are just as little trustworthy as any other participant in the game, be shore. War Dogs is one of the best black comedies I have seen in years - even though it's not really funny."

" An Average Affare, Expected More,
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,7,"War Dogs is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a top notch comedic cast. Jonah Hill and Miles Teller definitely own this movie, their chemistry on screen together is undeniable. There is a great back and forth between them that had me in stitches on several occasions, and they also shined in more dramatic moments when we really get to see these character's relationship. I had expected more, I was anticipating more fun, it took itself quite seriously at times. I understand that it is based on serious events, but it is advertised as a comedy with the same levels of Superbad and The Hangover, so I was not hoping for, nor was I pleased with, long, dragged out dialogue scenes. We do not know who to support in this movie either. David is clearly set up as the protagonist who watches his friend Efraim drive to the brink of insanity. However, David is not a very likable character either, he is greedy and self centered, while he may have some good traits, it's not enough to make him a protagonist we support. It's fun, but very forgettable. It has its flaws, but War Dogs is a good time while it lasts, would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or crime film, just do not go out of your way to see it. Two lifelong friends receive a contract from the Pentagon to become arm dealers for American troops in Afghanistan. Best Performance: Jonah Hill"
" Bow Wow Dogs
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,6,"War Dogs was entertaining enough, but far from anything great or even good. Mr.Hill gave me a headache. He overacts each scene and yells, curses, yells louder and yells even louder the whole movie. Mr.Teller is a snore bore and his performance is nothing to write home about. The film is basically a ripoff of Boiler Room and The Wolf of Wall Street. I can only guess that the eighty million box office take was from teenage and young males. There is nothing appealing about either character and if anything presents a dismal take on the desire to become successful. War Dogs is a Bow Wow..."
" Dogs of War
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,8,"Lord of War isn't that bad a comparison and throwing a bit of Wolf of Wall Street (with a tighter two men approach to it), you would say that comparison nails it. This is based on something that really happened and just the way it is portrayed is kind of mesmerizing. You wouldn't think some of those things would be possible. Would actually apply to the real world ... but apparently they do.Being the Devil's Advocate is one thing, getting greedy another. But you could almost argue it's human nature. And you wouldn't be too far off. Although obviously some do have a moral compass even when it doesn't always work, it may set off at some point and remind them of something they want and something they are or aren't. You may be shocked at how easy some things where back then, but that's life ... and it's really all about the ... Benjamins"
" War Dogs - A Different Movie the Second Time Around
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,9,"Some movies are exactly the same every time you see them. Todd Phillips's The Hangover is a perfect example. It is my go-to film anytime I'm blue and need a laugh. It is always the same stupidly funny movie that makes me laugh in all the same places (""Not you, fat Jesus..""). The same director does something very different with War Dogs. I loved this film when I saw it in the movies so I knew I'd enjoy it again recently on DVD. In the theater I thought it was funny - a great buddy film featuring two former middle school friends who reconnect and have an amazing adventure. Jonah Hill's character seems a brash, funny wheeler-dealer - the kid who always has big ideas. By the end of the film you see him for who he really is - a much darker, malignant personality - cunning and manipulative with no regard for others. And that is what makes War Dogs so different the second time around. The scenes he made funny and maybe a little endearing the first time you watch are much darker on second viewing as you see how he pulls people into his web. It was fascinating to see the same movie twice and get such a different feel the second time - if you liked War Dogs, it is definitely worth a repeat watching."
" Dogs of War
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,7,"Two childhood friends discover that there is money to be made as illegal arms dealers, but an atmosphere of distrust, basic human greed and the dangers of the Middle East get in the way in this vibrant comedy from Todd Phillips. The film is based on the experiences of two actual amateur arms dealers and with voice-over narration plus the presence of Jonah Hill, it is unsurprising that the film has been compared to 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. What made the Scorsese film such a ride though was the narration by a very charismatic Leonardio DiCaprio. Here though it is Jonah Hill, not Miles Teller, who is the charismatic one, and it is hard not to feel that 'War Dogs' would have flowed better with the deeply flawed Hill rather than the moralistic Teller narrating the tale. Tension also peters out somewhat towards the midway point, but the introductory scenes are great and the final 40 minutes are excellent as the plot takes a 'Social Network'-like turn with memorable quips like ""you're just playing the part of my best friend"". This final section of the film is in fact so strong, with the friendship between the pair really tested with so much money on stake, that it almost makes up for all other shortcomings. This is an unquestionably bumpy ride, but excellent chapter headings help pace the material well and Teller certainly holds his own even if Hill dominates every scene he is in."
" Rated #8. Really???
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,2,"I guess it's a good indication of our society's current status when you have this movie (which isn't't worth a 2nd watch) ranked higher than Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart, Apocalypse Now, Platoon & Full Metal Jacket in the war category. It's comical that this one is even in the top 100. Its not a terrible movie, but I have no interest in seeing it twice (unlike the aforementioned that I'll watch every time I see them on the channel guide). There must be a lot of kids that like Jonah Hill voting on here. That can be the only explanation."
" Missed Opportunity (sigh)
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,2,"DisappointmentWe have a great story that never received rightful promulgation--- never told the way it should have been. What a missed opportunity.Where do i begin. First, i would start with the script. Who's idea was it to take a Dramatic story and make it into a ""weak comedy?"" We're talking about a true life ""high stakes game"" of international arms dealing. You got a malignant narcissistic ego maniac, a nice guy (down on his luck) and holes in the check balance system of the MIC (Military industrial complex). How can you Lose?...you try and make the story into a comedy.Second, the Acting. Efrims character; Jonah Hill. Either Hill can't act or his lines for his role are badly written...I think it was both. Instead of drawing this malignant narcissist ""Efrim"" out into the full audience view, displaying what a true criminal he is, the director chooses to characterize him as some jolly goof ball who's supposedly ""deep down"" good at heart. The Truth is Efrim is a greedy fat pig who's never been called out for being the pathological liar that he is. The director should have made it a ""focus point"" to draw that character in full color without any misgivings. Instead, the character is presented as some jolly-ole good old boy from junior high that's really a cool guy (deep down). This is where the film goes wrong. Instead of creating tension between the predatory narcissist Efrim taking advantage of the Nice guy Packouz, we are led to believe the Narc was really deep down a good guy until the end. Again taking a made for Drama movie and turning it into a Comedy---big mistake.The Main Character Packouz, Played by Miles Teller actually does a decent job of playing the protagonist whos' been victimized by his dirt-bag ""fake"" friend. He's good hearted, helps his friend make millions, gives him good advice ""hey, don't mess up this deal, we're all making money, Henry's making his cut, just roll with it....if you do i'm out of here!"" But in the end, like most nice guys gets screwed by his lying fake friend. As example illustrates, Efrim ignores Packouz advice and plays the greedy scrooge that he is and almost gets Packouz killed in the process. If the Director has spent more time developing Packouz's character with more intimate emotional insight his dreams, hopes and motives, the movie would have been much better. Instead, he leaves us with dumb witted arguments between Packouz and his Cuban Girlfriend (a completely unrealistic idealist dreamer). Their discussions are so bad the audience is left to wonder ""who's the dumber?"" There are some well done scenes but they are far and few between. Bradly Cooper brings some life to the movie but its a ill fated effort. In the final Scene where Henry (Bradly Cooper) and Packouz meet by fate, we see decent acting between the best actors of the movie. Jonah Hill was a disappointment (probably more due to the script his was given and less so to his acting ability) however Hill has never really been impressive as an actor. If you have to pay for a movie, pass on this one."
" War and weapons are a necessity for some countries
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,8,"One of the better movies I saw in the last month and I watch between two and three movies per day. It's an interesting look on the weapon industry. Also the fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more interesting. It's just appalling that almost anybody could trade and sell any gun or ammunition without questions asked. In fact the buyers practically don't even want to know where they came from. The most important is that they can get them cheap. Jonah Hill is funny to watch, even in a bit more serious movie like this one. Because this movie has it's funny moments but it's not really a comedy when you think about the subject. The subject is war and weapons. It's an industry. Whole countries just need wars and weapons business. The USA are in a perpetual war, they are always at war with somebody, and that since they exist. It's a billion dollar business and they just can't afford not being at war. The movie is well shot, with a good cast, and an incredible story. Certainly worth at least one watch."
" A movie for 5th graders to teach them that good always prevails !!!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,6,"What could have been a great anti-hero setup on the war industry like 'Lord of War, turns to be a moral tale of good winning over badThe story starts off well developing both the characters and setting up Efraim as an anti-hero. The Jordan episode cements you to the protagonists and you can only expect the story to get more interesting. Instead it loses plot and everything comes crashes down for our heroes.The whimper ending, under-utilization of Brad Cooper and too much being fitted into one movie leaves a movie which has no memorable scenes.Watch it just for the guns and 'Dick Cheney's America' !!!"
" Homework for me
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this interpersonal drama based around weapon dealing. The introduction was great. I found Jonas hills character who was a real life stupid person annoying. I kept thinking, "" why is this guy shooting himself in the foot."" Additionally what these guys did I didn't feel was illegal. Why punish them. They didn't hurt anyone at least as far as the movie showed. Now I need to do research about the actual facts. Sometimes I hate movies ""based on actual events"" because it gives me homework."
" Solid Film But Not Greatness
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"Miles Teller and Jonah Hill are stellar co-stars. The film itself borrows from 'Boiler Room', 'Pain and Gain', 'Wanted' and 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. A glamorized all-American, alpha male story of rising up out of everyday life and getting rich. Like all these movies, a downfall or the tide turning is to be expected. It's a good movie, a solid movie but it's not all-time great. It's funny but not as funny as you'd expect. It even abandons comedy altogether for drama in the third act. The movie is well-paced and definitely worth the watch."
" another movie about crazy schemes to make money
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,6,"This movie is supposedly based on a true story, I doubt much of what was in the movie was true. I'd say a lot of it was dramatized for entertainment. Basically it is about these 2 guys, Efraim (whom will cheat and lie for a buck) and David( whom seems somewhat honest). David joins Efraim's business which is buying military supplies and selling them to the US government. They go on an adventure to Jordan where they smuggle guns into Iraq and get chased by gun toting rebels. Then they have an opportunity to land a $300 million deal, only problem is the bullets they got can't be sold to the US. So Efraim schemes and of course it comes back to bite them in the #ss.FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was interesting, it's always fun when you have a movie in which people pull off crazy schemes that work for a while then they get in trouble. Check it out."
" great work from Jonah Hill
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,8,"It's 2005 Miami. David Packouz (Miles Teller) is struggling as a masseuse. He reconnects with childhood friend Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill). Efraim has been buying guns from police auctions and reselling them online. There is a new government clearing house website for military contracts and he's looking to pick up some of the crumbs. David joins him after getting girlfriend Iz (Ana de Armas) pregnant. With dry cleaner Ralph Slutsky (Kevin Pollak) providing the capital, they start getting some contracts. Eventually, they meet unsavory arms dealer Henry Girard (Bradley Cooper) and get a massive Afghan deal.This is unlike Todd Phillips' more famed comedic movies. It's not big laughs but it is a lighter look at a darker world. Jonah Hill gets chubbier to fit this character perfectly. He is a douche but he is not a threatening douche. He has just enough crazy but not uncontrolled. His chemistry with Teller is terrific. This is a compelling story told in a compelling and engaging way. It's great all around and an overlooked gem."
" Albania part is Romania

Bucharest has its low ""ghettos"" but really, why mislead the public? Really ? Why is that? Romania is not Albania bro ?"
" Something different and a pleasant surprise
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,8,"A movie based on real events is obviously not guaranteed to be interesting or entertaining. However, in this particular case this film ticked both boxes and more. The two leading protagonists are convincing in their respective roles and while the bulk of the action takes place in the US, the Middle East and Eastern European locations add an extra dimension. Social historians please note that the film also shines the light on the unbelievable state of affairs that existed when the purchasing arm of the US military totally lost the plot."
" Guns guns guns
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,10,"War Dogs After movies such as ""The Hangover"", ""Due Date"" and ""Project X"", Todd Phillips is back with another home run movie. He writes, produces and directs ""War Dogs"" a film based on the true story of two men's quest for riches through government-contracted gunrunning.Jonah Hill plays Efraim the greedy self-absorbed gun dealer who pulls an old friend into the business. Jonah delivers Efraim as a character who the audience can both love and hate. With a crying laugh and swaggering I'm-better-than-you walk, Jonah believably changes into Efraim and leads you from one emotion to the next. Miles Teller who creates David, an equally memorable character, plays Efraim's friend. Teller shapes David into a frustrated man who's looking for a way out of massaging Miami's rich business class. Teller paints the character as an ordinary man of quiet desperation. David's shortcomings are made relocatable by his frustration. He's the kind of guy who's looking to do the right thing but is trying to succeed in a dangerous business at the same time. Teller's laid back, morally driven character succeeds at seeming so baseline by maintaining a surface calm throughout the film. His appeal comes from the way Teller portrays Packouz's relationship with his pregnant girlfriend. Everything he does is to take care of, and protect her even if it is by lying to her. Towards the end of the film, Teller's portrayal of the anger of being betrayed by a friend seemed so genuine you too hate Efraim right along with him. Allowing the audience to connect better with him, than his coke-snorting counterpart. The script seems typical of most of Todd Phillips movies. Cultural slang was pervasive in some of the characters. Both Jonah and Miles said ""Bro"" enough times to truly make me believe they did not even know each other's names. Teller's script with his girlfriend endears the couple to the viewer. You can easily tell at he beginning of the movie that they are at peace with each other. As the movie's tension builds so too does the tension between these two characters. There are a few scenes where Teller's girlfriend accuses him of lying to her and his reply is along the lines of, ""I did it for you."" On the other hand Efraim's character was also built upon through the language he used, with racial slurs and cursing Jonah was able to paint the picture of an ignorant American out of place in a business, country and day in age. The way the movie put events together was also quite interesting. With a series of blackout text frames, Todd Phillips was able to cover a larger time frame than a single running story line would have allowed. The text frames also gave hints as to what would happen in the up coming segment. It helped build excitement and in some cases dread for the characters as it became evident that the text in the fame would eventually turn into dialogue before the next section would begin. Although this did break the cohesion of the piece as a whole, it added an interesting aspect I do not see very often in films. The movie starts with David in a fog encrusted warehouse district with a gun pointed at his face before going back to the beginning of the story. This skipping around in the time frame of the film made me think of Quinton Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"". Although I would not say War Dogs will have the cult following that Tarantino's film does, by starting the movie where he does, Todd Phillips created a more compelling beginning for the movie.""War Dogs"" takes a unique look at the way the United States government handled dealing with undesirables to work the war machine during the Iraq war. With a compelling story, excellent actors, and social commentary extending beyond just the war to a social commentary on the American dream. This story about the desire to accumulate wealth is well worth the nearly two hour run time. I recommend you check this movie out!"
" Pleasantly surprised, but not blown away
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,7,"It's an enjoyable movie. After hearing some of the early reviews I expected something much worse. Jonah Hill's and Miles Teller's performances are the strongest part of War Dogs, and the story itself (especially knowing that it is based on actual events) is engaging enough that it kept me interested all the way through. At the same time there is nothing special or particularly original about this film. At times it reminded me of some of Scorsese's gangster films, like Goodfellas and Casino, and even The Wolf of Wall Street, but as far as directing or screenplay it is nowhere near those classics. I would definitely recommend it for a watch, but don't expect your world to be shaken. 7/10"
" Totally worth it.
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,8,"From the director of The Hangover trilogy comes a less comedic feature based on true story. but because its less comedic doesn't mean its not good, Its really entertaining and exciting. Out of all Todd Phillips work i like War Dogs better as this film has a good story line based on true events and humor; and it features some of the controversial topics as government arms deals and stuff. Good performances by Oscar Nominee Jonah Hill and Miles Teller, also good chemistry in the movie. Both have showed real talent over the course of these years with their features. In my opinion its not ""Great"", but its a ""Good"" movie. Highly recommended for everyone, Totally worth the watch."

" A slightly underrated film
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,8,"This is not an 8/10 film, but it's not 7/10 either. I'd give it 7.6 and rounding up to the nearest whole number.Great casting and acting. The acting could've been a little better, but I think the point was to make this film more light-hearted and less of a deep drama. I'm conflicted about that choice.The film has a good amount of a relationship drama, the friendship between the two entrepreneurs, a cross-border smuggling action scene, enough jokes to cut the tension, which made this film more mainstream and easier to watch for most people. Perhaps a gritty, dark film about weapons and war would've been too intense for many and would've polarized people into loving or hating this film, rather than having most people liking it.My wine-like ""goes with"" recommendation: I recommend the show The Night Manager to go with this film."
" Don't go to war over 'War Dogs'!
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,5,"'War Dogs' looks good on paper and the trailer for the film sells the movie's comedy and fun moments. It seemed like the perfect project for director Todd Phillips ('The Hangover' trilogy, 'Road Trip', 'Old School') as he reunites with Bradley Cooper and adds Jonah Hill and Miles Teller to this story, based on true events about two school friends who love to smoke up and run guns for the government – some of which might be illegal. This is a very different film for Phillips from what we're used to, and unlike the trailer, the film isn't all that funny. Sure, there are some moments of small laughter here and there, due to Jonah Hill's character, but the rest is Phillips' wink to a mix of gangster movies, including 'Scarface', 'Goodfellas', 'Casino', and even a bit of 'Drive'.That sounds good on paper, but the end result was lackluster with the 115 minute movie seeming like a three hour endeavor. The pacing is off and one scene just seems to be a repetition of the one before it. 'War Dogs' tells the true story of Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, who were high school friends, who eventually got a government contract to supply weapons to the U.S. Army in Afghanistan with no prior experience and being in their early 20s. This film of course has a bunch of fictionalized elements, which is good, but never has anything original or fresh.Perhaps the best scene of the film is in the trailer, where Diveroli (Jonah Hill) and Packouz (Miles Teller) are riding in the truck in the Iraq desert, being chased by people with guns. That scene was funny, action-packed, and highly entertaining. Unfortunately the rest of the film is fairly drab with some flashes of funny Jonah Hill moments. Phillips sure packed the film with winks and nods to the gangster movies I mentioned above with the same music, shots, and narration style that you see in Scorsese films. Plus, there are 'Scarface' posters everywhere in the film, along with references to the actual movie by name. I just got tiresome very fast.It's an interesting enough story to tell, but the characters aren't that redeeming nor are they that likable throughout, particularly Jonah Hill's character, who he plays the part perfectly. Teller is also great, but isn't given much to work with. Bradley Cooper shows up for a few seconds here and there, but again, isn't given much time to really explore his character, who turns out to be the most interesting part of the movie. 'War Dogs' looks good from a technical and visual standpoint, but there really isn't anything underneath that veil.WAIT FOR NETFLIX!"
" Brilliant film
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,8,"I admit that I was skeptical at the prospect of Jonah Hill making a serious film, but boy was I in for a surprise. The trailer made this film look like a weird drama comedy, something like Knocked Up with an inverted comedy to drama ratio (Knocked Up is maybe 80% comedy, 20% drama), playing up the funny/wacky Jonah Hill parts. The love/relationship aspect of David Packouz could've gone the wrong way and could've gone on for too long, but I think they got everything right.Without spoiling anything (I'm saying what the trailer shows)The business part was fun and intriguing. Smart use of montages to cut time and tell the story quickly, something similar to Breaking Bad's cooking/growing business montages.Their adventures were just the right amount. Enough fun/action/outdoors to not make this a claustrophobic office film where deals are done on phones/faxes/internet. The personal story between the two was good. The family drama, although not my favorite part, made the stakes higher and made everything personal. Shady characters, shady wars, grey market, dirty business and you've got yourself a great picture.There's enough comedy to cut through the drama and not make this a heavy piece. Some may fault it for not saying anything about the war, but it didn't need to. Not everything needs to be an anti-war piece, just as not every film needs to be some chest- thumping flag-'n-anthem patriotic tear-jerking ode. I like that it did neither - this is not some ""USA USA"" film nor some lecturing film that tells us war is bad, or that the Iraq was is bad, something almost everyone agrees with ALREADY (and the rest won't change their minds because of a Jonah Hill film, so why should we all suffer?).This film reminds me of Wolf of Wall Street more than anything, but it has shades of Casino, American Gangster, Catch Me If You Can and American Hustle.I would rate it higher than Wolf of Wall Street, which is too choreographed and theatrical for my taste. This film doesn't overdo this ""look how rich we've become"" because it didn't need to.The story is front and center. There is no time wasted on lavish parties, fireworks, champagne, women in bikinis, etc. It is not a ""homes of the rich"" and arms-dealer mashup. It's just the story of the arms dealers.One of the best films of the year."
" A very weak movie, expected at least a better movie.
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,4,"War Dogs is a movie that I think is weak, it is weak in comedy, it is not so funny, I did not laugh at it, the script is problematic, the performances are pretty much the same as Jonah Hill until it's different Of other roles, I found him a lot more serious in that film, Miles Telles until just reasonable, and the chemistry of the two does not work as well as it should, the cast still has Ana de armas, Bradley Cooper and etc, the direction of Todd Phillips who did Even good movies, he is average, he loses control of the film during the course, the soundtrack goes to taste, the film does not have memorable moments, and no dialogue, War Dogs is a weak movie, I was never excited to watch it Movie, the more I expected something better. Note 4.9"
" Makes you want to watch it over and over again
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,9,"Even though ""War Dogs"" isn't claimed to be an action film it has certain aspects of the mise-en-scene which puts it under the action genre. Such as, guns money and drugs. It is an all round spectacle.I really liked the way this film was edited as sometimes we see captions pop up on screen such as ""if i wanted you dead, you'd already be dead"". Then, over the next few scenes we will hear the lines be said. My opinion of it was a nice touch from the editing crew as it makes the audience prepared on what the chapter is about. A lot like Tarantino's films. During the film, we see the personalities of two friends and throughout the movie we see their personalities evolve as well as their friendship. Packouz (Miles Teller) is a masseuse working in Miami and at a funeral we learn that his junior high friend Diveroli (Jonah Hill) is an International arms dealer. When we find out that Packouz is having a baby, Diveroli takes him on to work at his company to earn more money. This gratitude of kindness and help gives the audience an idea on how friendship should be used and is the main moral of the story for me.For most of ""War Dogs"", i loved Hill's character as we got to see his personality in a good way. However, after the FBI find out that Diveroli and Packouz have done illegal movements in getting 10,000,000 rounds of bullets to Afghanistan for the American military Packouz doesn't want to speak to him. In the final few scenes, we see Diveroli and Packouz in an elevator and Diveroli tells Packouz he was acting as his friend. This made me extremely shocked because we as an audience had learned to love this character and in an instance all respect had gone, making the scene have a powerful effect on the audience.Overall, I loved this film and it signified the real meaning of trust and friendship and was a great spectacle."
" highly recommended
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,9,"This was one of my favorites movies in 2016. I waited too long to see how Hills and Teller could complement on the big screen. And when I finally been able to see it, I was happy because it was all I had expected. Both of them shown previously that they can play drama roles (Moneyball and Whiplash, for example), but in this movie they proved that they can do it and be funny at the same time. The movie is similar in some aspects to The Wolf of Wall Street (where Jonah Hill made an excellent performance) and Hangover, but it never lose his own identity. So why should someone see this movie? You should see War Dogs if you want to see a funny, dramatic and entertained movie."
" Well done, but not very fun or funny
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,6,"This movie is well done. There are no bad parts and they fit together nicely. Script, acting, directing, all is well.But, for a comedy, it's not very fun or funny. It's interesting, but, there's much more fun to be had with this setup, it's a shame we don't have more of it. Yes, it has fun and funny moments, but, very few. OTOH, the story itself is not so interesting or weird as to be the fun by itself.The ""unreal"" (like the ride through the ""Devil's triangle"") and ""fact- wrong"" (like presenting Romania as Albania) parts of the movie are not a real problem, since it's a comedy.About the only thing that's ""not so good"" is the fact that it's too political. A ""bad Bush"" kind of a movie. Strange and silly things happen in wars since the dawn of time, yet this movie feels like it's trying to show that it was all his and Dick Cheney's fault. A little less political commentary and more fun and this could have been very good."
" Exceeded my expectations
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"I wasn't too sure what to expect going in to 'War Dogs'. I had put off seeing it for a while. The trailers hadn't really done a lot for me. I'm a huge Jonah Hill fan, but Miles Teller I could take or leave. Todd Phillips in the director's chair is almost always a sign of quality though, so I knew I'd get around to seeing it eventually. I finally got around to it tonight and now I regret waiting so long. What a great movie. Firstly, it finds the perfect balance between comedy and drama. If anything it probably leans more towards the dramatic side of things, however there are plenty of laughs, mostly thanks to Hill's terrific comedic timing. Secondly, what I had feared might be a bit of a bland story actually works very well. It's simple enough to appreciate and never strain your brain over, yet complex enough to be fascinating due to it being based on a true story. It reminded me a lot of 'The Wolf of Wall Street', simply minus all the sexuality that film contained. I can see the argument being put forward that none of the characters were likable, but it's not a film that's ever trying to make them likable either. The film doesn't need us to root for them, it simply wants to take us on their journey. Other than that I can't see a lot of areas that you could poke holes in this film. It's well-directed, well-acted, well-written and just an all around fun time to be had."
" Not Funny Failure....Obnoxious & Bland Satire About Gun-Running
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,5,"A Drama/Comedy about a couple of Real-Life Scumbags (no not Bush and Cheney) but Two Twenty Something Buds who have a Jolly Good Time Making Money Selling War Weapons.The Actual Shooting and Maiming of Real People is Hardly Questioned and left Off-Screen. That would be a Buzz-Kill. Because this Movie's Moral Center is All Over the Middle East Map with some Grounding in America's Upper Class Landscape.The Film is Mildly Entertaining if You find War-Profiteering Mildly Entertaining. The Movie is Obnoxious, just like Jonah Hill and Bland, just like Martin Tiller.It's all Slick and Shiny with very Little Insight and Fails to make much of a Statement about the Bush War, or Cheney's Haliburton, aside from Well Known Surface Stuff. The Music Cues are Scorsese-Esque and the Attitude Toward Guns and War are Shallow Sensational ""Scarface"" Stuff.The Film seems to Think that Lying to One's Wife is more of a Crime than anything else that is going on here. It's a Half-Baked Mess of a Movie that is a Pale Shadow of the Films that it Copys. Especially the Great ""Lord of War"" (2005), Directed by Andrew Nicoll."
" An entertaining look at some infamous real-world events
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"War Dogs is a comedy drama film directed by Todd Phillips which follows two arms dealers, Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, who receive a US Army contract to supply munitions for the Afghan National Army.This is by no means a memorable film but it serves as platform for two good performances by Miles Teller and Jonah Hill especially the latter who delivers some of the best comic moments of the film.He is almost unrecognizable as Diveroli and Teller and Hill play well off of each other.However the supporting characters come out as rather flat and boring.Todd Phillips is best known for making raunchy comedies like The Hangover or Road Trip but this is his first film that feels more grown up and meaningful.He does a fairly good job here and the cinematography by Lawrence Sher borderlines between flat and breathtaking.There is even a cameo from a particular A-list actor that was enjoyable to see. War Dogs doesn't truly deliver but it is watchable and entertaining enough to keep viewers interested."
" Jonah Hill and Miles Teller are great together
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,7,"Jonah Hill and Miles Teller give great performances in this film based on a true story. Having been best friends in middle school the two meet up again at a funeral several years later. Miles Teller is a masseuse working for direction in life when Jonah Hill shows up in a nice car and a nice suit obviously very successful. he then review tomorrow that he has been working with his uncle purchasing contract and selling guns . At first Miles character A bit skeptical about getting involved but once he sees the money that they can make he quickly joins the team. They are enjoying making a ton of money and living a party lifestyle but once the biggest contract over their allies becomes available they have to do whatever it takes to make sure the deal gets done which involves reviewed the country I'm going to the Middle East . Bradley Cooper also gives a good performance in a small about crucial role . Jonah Hill got a well-deserved Golden Globe nomination, a good mix of action and comedy a must see for anyone who is fans of Jonah Hill or miles Teller."
