" His name was Brett
",2021-04-11 00:00:00,9,His name was Brett. He died of a rare brain cancer called glioblastoma multiform. GBM for short. He was my husband and best friend.Where were my actors and where are they now?When does my Collateral Beauty come?This movie took me out of my pain and into someone else's fictional pain and done so well.Seven years and no one will help me get past it. It was a beautiful mystery his friends and coworkers pulled off for him. All I can think about is my demise when I leave my one and only young son or vice versa.This movie can really put your life into perspective. I didn't cry. I just know that I'm not alone now. But where are my (actors)? Beautifully done and poignant.
" So glad I watched this movie!
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,10,"Incredible movie... So well put together perfoming the abstract ways of death, time and love... truly heartwarming and a must watch slice of life.Remember ""sometimes you can be/need someone from the outside, to change your/their perspective on life. You can open their eyes just but a simple phrase.And what truly beautiful acting, as expected from these great actors, one of the greatest actors ever Will Smith."
" Can't believe I waited 5 yrs to watch this movie
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,10,For some reason I thought I have seen this movie but upon watching for the first time I knew I hadn't. This was the most heart felt movie I've seen in a long time. Will Smith did an outstanding job bringing to life what others who have lost a child must feel. This cast was outstanding. I was already a fan of each of the main characters I am an even bigger fan now. I wish I could give this movie more then 10stars. AWESOME!!!
" If You have lost someone
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,8,"I was taken surprised by my own reaction when I first started watching this movie I was not all that impressed was kind of slow didn't really understand exactly what the actors were doing but then something interesting happened It went straight to my gut I am familiar with the pain of losing someone and having no real answer as to why the platitudes that were never real never had much significance to me either but as the movie went on it brought out feelings in me that unless the acting & the plot were significant would not have happened it was not catharsis it was seeing something I too, like Will Smith's character & others!! Had not been able to incorporate thus in actuality giving the film meaningful drama"
" Powerful!
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,10,"After watching this masterpiece I am surprised, mortified that this movie didn't win any Oscars! One of the most powerful movies since Crash. I wished it hadn't taken me so long to witness this skillfully scripted, wonderfully performed portrayal into depths of life and death."
" Almost deterred by the Reviews
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,10,"And here is another example: don't always listen to reviews, watch the movie and assess for yourself!"
" More than a film
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,10,"Where to even begin, This movie is one of the most underrated movies, possibly ever. When ever i watch it I am filled with pretty much every emotion there is which is such a sensations feat for everyone involved, as for will smith he truly comes into his own as the grieving father who feels his world has completely ended, and any father/mother can completely sympathies with his character. I myself would never be able to live through the death of a child it would destroy me. The power and portrayal of pain, hurt and confusion Howard is going through is catapulted through the screen, this is one of the only movies to bring me to the point of tears. By the end of the film it leaves you feeling completely exhilarated and an emotional mess, but in a good way filling you with joy and thanks, I love will smith and many of the other actors and actresses in this film but if I could speak and congratulate on a performance that causes such an emotional impact to will smith this would be it, you feel everything he is enduring."
" Brilliant
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,10,Will Smith proves himself to be a true actor. The cast each and everyone brilliant. The script is a masterpiece of writing. The soundtrack stunning. New York is a lovely backdrop to this amazing work. Congratulations to the director the crew the passion of making this film. Film critics are not 5he smartest people in the world nor are they the most sensitive- ignore their ignorance and stupidity and watch a great film
" Critics need a different approach
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,9,"At first I praised this movie because of Fan factor, later I realized actually this is a great movies. Let the writers give negative reviews but if you like movies that makes you question and think then definitely you will rate it above 7"
" Love, Time, and Death
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,7,"Rarely does the world get a story this beautiful yet also unique. First off, Will Smith was incredible in this role. I know he doesnt do much in this film, but the actual emotion you can feel from his character is acted out incredibly well. Tragedy like this follows many unfortunate souls and tears them apart piece by piece. You see that here in every aspect of Will's character, Howard.Then there are the 3 abstracts. Love, Time, and Death. These are the pieces of life that tie all of humanity together. The story of Love, Time, and Death are told in a real manner and give great depth to the story as the film moves on.Im surprised it took me this long to finally see this amazing movie and Im glad I finally did. It tells a great story in just over an hour and a half. It will give you a better outlook on life, eapecially in 2020."
" Give it time, love and ... death, by tears
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,10,"I've heard so many bad things about this film, which o believed due to three English actors playing American leads...(all fabulous)
But I gave this movie time found love and died from tears. Beautiful work. Beautiful message."
" Come back when there's nothing to live for
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,8,"Will was great, it is magnificent to watch this guy from a role to a role. In the beginning it seemed like Leo Dicaprio, a classification stamp assigned to him, regardless of the greatness of the actor. But as years and roles came...Edward, Michael and Kate, nice trio. Here, they are all with their own serious problems, although seemingly invisible to the person this movie is centered around - Howard (Will). After loss of his loved daughter. Soul too hurt to live, sorrow too big to heal. Business they all have in common is falling apart with Howard faraway. Hence they decide to stop it, either to reach him or to get rid of him. One way or another, they hire trio of actors to stage those Howard is addressing, when expressing the grief: The Death, the Time and the Love.As story goes, trio of actors and the trio of Howard's mates crosses. And Howard himself...
No real parent would ever hesitate to give his own life and Howard is the right parent."
" Wonderful Movie
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,8,"Very Emotional and Beautiful Movie. Must Watch. Don't go with negetive review, just watch it"
" Just a great movie! Emotional great acting
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,10,Emotional roller-coaster and it was well worth the watch. One of the best movies I have seen and just great acting. The pain of losing a child i feel would be like this it would dystroy you and it hits all those notes!!
" Potter Would Call It ""Sentimental Hogwash""
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,8,"Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" no doubt would call ""Collateral Beauty"" sentimental hogwash. But then Potter was the meanest man in town. Yes the director could have made a better movie and made better use of the incredibly talented cast, but he didn't. He made this movie, and critics who take movies to task for what they aren't are usually cynical beyond belief, able to ignore a genuine effort to make a film about what the death of a child means to parents whose lives are irreparably damaged. Will Smith delivers a remarkable performance that can make you cry by just looking at his grieving face. There are times that the allusions to Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" are obvious and may make you wish that this film had gone even farther with the fantastic elements. But a ""Christmas Carol"" has been made into a film several times, so this is more of a variation on a theme. Let's put it this way, if you are a fan of Quentin Tarantino, this film will nauseate you. If you love ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" this one is for you."
" If you know, you know
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,10,"I'm nearly two months into my own loss. I have been going through the motions and my brother recommended I watch this movie. I ignored the reviews and trusted him and I'm glad I did. If you are going through a loss, this will help. It's easy to relate to and fairly therapeutic. Acting was great across the board and the premise was realistic. I was tearing up throughout and I can't remember the last movie that had this kind of impact on me."
" Awesome Movie
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,10,"If you have never lost a close relative (daughter, son, parents, siblings) you would not understand the meaning and clarity of this movie (this is for all the negative reviews). This movie was AWESOME"
" Great movie
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,9,Absorbing and thought provoking. Good cast doing good acting.
" Perfection
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely beautiful and brilliant! Start to finish is don't blink, just feel."
" Unintentional comedy
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,1,"Will Smith mopes his way through this unbelievably stupid film; would-be tear jerker intended as Oscar bait, it was (deservedly) a critically mauled box office disaster. Scenes intended to make a viewer cry instead inspires the reaction, ""Who writes this crap?""Best watched with a laugh track."
" Surprisingly wonderful
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,10,Confused by the meta score . This was a movie that hit you hard . The acting is on point makes you realize good acting will always destroy special effects . Cast makes the story
" I recently lost a loved one...
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,10,"There are no words to describe how one feels when losing a piece of themselves. Watching this movie brought things to my surface that I wasn't prepared for. Tasteful, elegant, mesmerizing and hope inspiring is my review. Absolutely adore this movie and all that made it....TY."
" Don't listen to negative
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,9,Don't read the negative review. Watch it rate your experience. One the best i have seen.
" Beautiful movie!
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,10,"If you've ever lost someone very close to you, you know the feelings you have and how everything looks different from ""before"" and ""after"" a tragedy. This lovely movie of awesome actors, really took me by surprise. I have been there myself, and this brought me to tears, but in a good way. True friends don't tell you to ""get over it""......they help you get through it!"
" I mean, I am not as angry as some with this movie
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,5,"Well well well. What we have here is another Will Smith drama that seems to get negative reception from critics and praise from audiences (at least most of them). Collateral Beauty was released in 2016 and as mentioned, recieved mostly negative reception and even recieved a nomination at the Razzies. The film did alright at the box office. The film stars Will Smith, Edward Norton, Keira Knightley, Michael Pena, Kate Winslet and Helen Mirren (just to name a few).We see Howard (played by Will Smith) grieving over the loss of his daughter. He is single and works at this advertising agency or something and his friends/coworkers are noticing that he is not himself. (Of course he lost his kid). They basically follow and send a private investigator to figure out what he does with his life. They find out that he writes letters to love, time, and death. Howard's friends go and find some actors to portray love, time, and death in the hopes that they can bring Howard back into the real world.Well......... I have seen reviews of this film where people absolutely rip this film apart. (Check out Stoned Gremlin Production's Midnight Screening video of this film). But, I can see why people would hate this film. But I am not gonna waste my anger on this film. First of all, what good is there in this film? Well, Will Smith is pretty decent in this film. Also, this film can be emotional at times (even though if you think about it, this film shouldn't). But even though this film can be emotional, it is not very often. (Actually, there was only once with Michael Pena's character). Other than that, the film was well.......... not great. First of all, this film just has people who are probably the sickest of people who go and try to make this guy think that he is crazy. It is wrong and it is sick. There are two big plot twists that I didn't like just for the fact is that one of the plot twists completely makes previous conversations and scenes completely meaningless. The other plot twist makes sense in way I guess, but at the same time, it is just stupid. I suppose it is interesting that these people who hire these actors to portray Love, Time, and Death expect to help their friend but these actors end up helping them. The cast here consists of actors/actresses that are fairly well known and have appeared in better films and have acted far better as well. Again, Will Smith did a pretty good job here. Another complaint that seems to be in everyone's negative reviews of this film is the misleading trailer. I have not watched it (nor did I see a trailer for it in 2016). Does this film manage to portray grief well here? I don't think so but that is me. I have seen people actually get something from this film but I just did not get anything from this film at all.Overall, this film is not great. There are some things that were good but the things that are bad can be really annoying at times. I didn't get much out of this film but I do believe some people got something out of this film."
" I'm blown away this wasn't nominated
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,10,"An incredibly well filmed emotion filled story about loss! The cinematography, acting, music, and writing are riveting! I'm surprised someone said this has cheesiness Collateral Beauty is far from it. The only part of the story I don't understand is the several people that follow Will Smiths character, I couldn't figure out if they're an hallucination or not."
" Love this movie!
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,10,Love love love. In love with the cast and the story.
" Loved every second
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,9,"The reason why this movie has a mediocre rating is the fact, that a lot of people see it the wrong way. As a tragedy, a simple movie. But it is way more... Collateral Beauty is a wonderful homage to life."
" See for Yourself.
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,10,"This movie was fantastically portrayed with the deepest emotions about life, death and how we may feel about all of those unanswered questions that run through us at our most saddest times. I loved the actors, they did an amazing job and made this drama film as real as it gets. You will feel every bit of those emotions that life itself causes us in this movie and that's not a bad thing. With a world so lost in translation and with emotions, feelings and humanity decaying this movie brings it all back to life. Don't hesitate to watch this one. A must see movie you will not only enjoy but see a part of yourself in every character."
" The Movie
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,10,"Honestly a slept on film. It doesn't have the best of anything, rather it is the heart warming the heart warming story and talented acting brought to the forebear of this film."
" More like collateral damage.
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,5,"Even a cast of the most accomplished screen actors of a generation can't elevate this ill-thought through attempt at a modern day fusion of A Christmas Carol and It's a Wonderful Life. The idea is charming enough and could've possibly worked if the script hadn't been so riddled with cliches, under-developed characters and an incredibly rushed conclusion. The base material is so woefully under-developed that inevitably Collateral Beauty is a puddle-deep drama with no emotional heft. All rushed and pointless. Makes you wonder what blackmail material the director had over the cast..."
" Don't get distracted by overall ratings, it's really a wonderful movie
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,7,"I don't know why most Will Smith movies in the recent years are getting that harsh ratings especially from critics, but anyway my advice in general for any movie, watch the trailer, if you like it, then give the movie a go for 10 min tops and you will know if you want to continue watching or just turn it off. This movie is really good, I only gave it 7 as the writing has a number of significant loopholes that could have been avoided but the story in general is really touching and the acting from everyone is amazing."
" Amazing movie with great acting.
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,9,I could not ask for a more heart felt drama than this. As a man with two daughters it had me close to tears. The actors were just amazing. Great job throughout the entire movie.
" Straight to the heart.
",2020-07-21 00:00:00,10,"Sometimes someone's death is necessary to shake many other people's lives. Never loose hope in this life because our purpose here is far greater than we could possibly imagine. If you need to be motivated and inspired, look no further, watch this. Extraordinary performance by all actors and an outstanding Will Smith in a very difficult role which he interprets so faithfully, I couldn't look at him without getting tears in my eyes."
" Beauty
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,6,This movie was pretty good and heartfelt. Critics should probably see it again and see what's good in it.
" Nice idea bad execution
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,4,"The movie deals with Will Smith in pain for the loss of his daughter.His neglect of his company is causing his partners and also friends to be in a situation were they may go broke..Will Smith wrote 3 letters each addressed to death,love,time. So the partners idea is to hire 3 actors to play a physical manifestation of each one, get them to talk to him to the point he breaks down while they have a PI film it and digitally remove the actors so Will seems insane and they can use it to remove his voting rights at the company...Seriously this is the main plot.The movie wants to touch on the subject of loss and finding meaning after that, but the plot is so bad and it keeps getting worse.The twist is the actors are really Death Time and Love which makes the movie even more ludicrous once you start asking questions like well once the went to digitally remove the actors they weren't surprised to see none there? the company that did the job wasn't like, hmm you know there is nothing to remove right?The twist also can be seen from a mile away, it is hinted at the first meeting of the 3 ""actors""This movie reminded me of Ghosts of Christmas past and to me that was the proper way to do it.Have all spirits visiting him by themselves without the stupid plot, alone and in their own time and for the partners plot have Love visit Edward Norton , Time visit Kate Winslet and Death visit Michael Peña each giving them what they need and without any partner seeing any of the other spirits.Also there is another kinda silly plot going on were Will goes to therapy and the therapist is actually his wife, i mean i don't even know what to make of that.Overall a boring movie mainly due to its plot."
" A beautiful film
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,10,"I wanted to see this movie And I finally did. I was outvoted to see it when it first came out due to it's bad reviews. I can say now with full certainty, that I can not fathom why those reviews even exist. This is not a perfect movie, but everything it does it does well and with grace. The personification of these abstract things, love, death and time show how sometimes we need to confront and see these things for what they are: a part of life. it is because of death that our time should be spent on love...yes I cried repeatedly.and please like I always say if you had it on your list watch it now and just decide for yourself."
" Tear Jerker of note..
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,9,Right up there with City of Angels et al. This is a beautiful movie - great cast delivering excellent performances with a special nod for Naomie Harris. Maybe a bit too emotional for the guys but the gals with love it!
" Collateral Beauty
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,10,"The plot is so powerful. The acting is so emotional, I can literally felt the anger and sorrow that Will Smith trying to express, and his doubt to the three main element in life. Every line in the script exist for a reason, it did mean something. Every chatacter was well develop in the story. This is just a perfect movie.Thanks for making such a good movie possible. Thanks for not wasting such a good script. The collateral beauty."
" Casting
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,7,"This movie would have greatly benefited from a different actor in the role of Howard. Will Smith is better suited for action/adventure. Nothing wrong with that, we all have different talents. Other than that an enjoyable movie"
" Excellent, the intelligence of the viewers are seen in their reviews
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,10,"Like with any great movie the problem is that everyone interprets when the movie and script is telling you the story point blank, you just need to follow it and listen to what you are being told.Every single thing in the plot of this movie is explained to you if you simply listen.
The screenwriting, acting, editing and directing of this movie is excellent. If you try to apply logic to this emotional traumatic story than make sure you actually possess logic. If you do not understand the movie it simply shows your own emotional intelligence as well as your logical intelligence is lacking.I will not spoil the plot nor will I take my time to explain the movie. All the questions you could have are simply answered by the story they beautifully and masterfully told. Just pay attention and open your narrow mind."
" Not well executed
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,6,"Collateral Beauty is quite a deep film yet it lacked a good guiding hand. A better director and team could have transformed it into a powerful and meaningful film. Otherwise it falls flat and comes across as not strong enough. There is no emotional pay off and good set up to carry it all the way through. Despite strong performances it is not enough to save this film. The deeper themes could have been explained better, there could have been more symbolism present and yes a much stronger director and team at the helm."
" Dont belive all the bad reviews
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,9,"I didn't expect nothing, and this movie really touched me. Shows life as is, with all our fails, loves, sad times, happy times. Life its not easy for nobody, but it worths."
" The Dialougue "" If only we could be strangers again"" has my heart!
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,9,"""Connect to the beauty of life.""
Every tragedy is accompanied by beauty. However, as we are steeped in grief and sorrow, we tend to overlook the beauty that is caused by the tragedy.Emotional, dialogues delivery, expressiveness and the development of characters are some things that make this movie worth watching. Although there are some predictable moments that make this journey of 90 minutes, worth taking.Will Smith! The multitalented actor, have successfully made me fall in love with the character of Howard. It makes you cry, smile, sad, emotional & touchy at the end.Every actor has acted phenomenally. You will learn that all emotions are there to teach you something and will show you the new and unique side of life and love.My Favourite Dialogue that makes me emotional every time is ""If only we could be strangers again.""Strangers! A word that has every reverse emotion in it. A word that makes you lonely. A word that leaves you heartbroken. Strangers!"
" Soooo much talking.... Snooze fest
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,3,"Forced drama, drenched in over-acting.. Dialogue is never ending and very mundane... Trying very hard to be impacting but it's just pretentious. I'm writing this during the movie (at home) to avoid complaining out loud and annoying my wife! I'm just not into star worship these days. Loaded cast, but a true dud."
" A movie about life - pain, friends and moving on
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,10,"People who don't like such a story, don't have a soul and have never really lost a person in life..."
" Amazing 'feels' movie
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,10,Awesome cast with great acting.I cried and the last time I cried was watching E.T.
" Critics need to change job. Awesome movie!
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,8,"I almost quote another user's headline which was 'critics need to get a life'. Only critique I have: I would've enjoy the movie a little bit better if the part with the company and the actors was a little less relevant. The movie had the potential to keep people crying the whole time. But, this said, it was awesome.
I read a lot of just, STUPID, critics. Critics should start being less arrogant and start understanding that we, viewers, don't give a damn about their deep personal tastes.
""Professional"" criticism should be based on general criteria, which can be consulted and judged by everyone, and not on strictly personal tastes or on the frustration of some unsatisfied wife because will smith has not shown the ABS. I'm not a critic, but I can spot little haters with a keyboard that call themselves ""critics"". And there's plenty of them. Imo, great movie. Sorry for who didn't enjoy it."
" A worthy watch
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"A good cast and a worthy watch.
In times of self isolation looking for a film that is worth a watching isn't always easy but this is a film well worth your time and with what is going on in the world it is definitely has something to say on how we see and feel about the people around us."
" One of the most underrated movies of all time
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,10,"Yes, the story can feel a little sappy, but I think the cast does really well with what they are given. The story is sweet and we watch it at home every Christmas time"
" Watch something funny instead
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,4,"If you look at the time stamp on my review then you can probably guess that I'm already bored out of my brain. I remember all the trailers when it came out, advertising some deep and profound movie featuring most's favourite, Will Smith. Well, it started not too bad. Began with an interesting plot and with the kind of pain nobody would ever dismiss and then it just kind of falls flat around half way. It was just trying too hard. It tried putting in all these little tidbits to keep you thinking and giving all the other characters depth and emotions that came across as the robot writing thinking to themselves 'oh, other humans will probably find this sad let's put it in.' The only reason I cried during some of it was because Will Smith was crying and then it all went dry in the last half hour and I was resisting the urge to see how much was left. I guess what I'm trying to say is, don't bother. Watch something funny instead."
" Make sure you have a lot of tissues
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,10,"I tend not to watch movies that make me cry. What can I say Will Smith is one of my favourite actors so regardless I was going to watch this. Well I cried so hard first time it physically hurt. I felt everything as though it was happening to me. Second time a little better as I knew what was coming. Now I'm having another go to see if I can watch without the sobs. This movie takes you in, absolutely perfect."
" What makes a movie great
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,9,"It's a movie I first thought wasn't fair, I cried my tears out for it. I couldn't see the collateral beauty. But it made me discuss the issue with my family. After talking about it I started to realise the meaning of it all. And I guess that is what makes a movie great. That the message makes you think things over and reflect on your own life. When people discuss the meaning of a movie, it means the movie has touched there soul. And if it can reform the perspective in there life, it means it was a value to there life.
I will never forget this movie. It touched me soul."
" Really good actually
",2020-03-10 00:00:00,10,I was pleasantly surprised and happy I watched it! Please take the time and give it a go as I think you will love it too! This is not the end!!
" A thing of beauty
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,10,"I don´t write too many reviews, and more often than not when I dislike something.
But after having seen Collateral Beauty and finding it rated with a meager 6,8 average I will do something I thought i´d hardly ever do, and give it a rating of 10 (in words :TEN).
Because in my opinion it is one of the rare occasions where a movie works so well that all the flaws that it contains can easily be forgiven.
If the three actors actually exist, or if they truly ARE love, time and death....
well- who knows.
I must say I was expecting to see Whit, Claire and Simon walk into the ""theater"" at the end, to find it empty and be told that it was like that for a long time.
A bit of a ""twilight-zone"" moment. But maybe this would have been too much- and it wasn´t really necessary to make the point.
So I will just say that when Will Smith said about the cast "" ""If we are all judged by the company we keep ... then I want this cast with me for life!"" he was saying something true and beautiful.
Helen Mirren´s performance alone would have been worth a rating of 9 , I have hardly ever seen a woman that fascinating, moving, funny, attractive and sexy.
Well done, funny to read about the director having been changed, and who was initially asked to do what part- but the outcome could simply not have been better.
So many American movies about live, love etc. are not worth watching a second - or even first- time- but this one I watched again as soon as it ended.
Because it is a thing of beauty.
Thanks for that."
" Stunningly rare heartfelt film
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,10,"Wasn't sure what to expect from this film and thought it might be similar to Seven pounds. As several have noted this is a heartfelt stunning film on the nature of loss & grief and man it packs a punch. The cast and their performances are excellent and it is a shame that not many saw this on its initial release.This is a film to be savoured for its richness of characters and the situation that they find themselves in. In an age where super hero films these days are like fast food something like this is akin to finding water in the desert. Kudos to the director, David Frankel for bring these characters to life in such a profound way. This film is highly recommended."
" Why? Why that much cheesiness?
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,4,"So cheesy and ""stupid"" including the characters and this is coming from someone who loves philosophy, and deep thinking, but this is plain stupid, trying to manipulate people's emotions. Stupid. I am disappointed to see Ed Norton in it."
" Interesting idea partly falls apart
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,6,"It's a lovely movie that could make grown men weep. The top notch cast carries it through and it's easy to disregard the holes in the story. The last 20 minutes lost its way for me. The emotional intent, good acting and script seemed to have got jumbled up. But that's just how I viewed it."
" Great film
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,7,"This is a good film which attract our attention and that has some surpirses. Will Smith, once more, show how good actor he is. The plot in very interesting and emotional."

" Surprisingly Good.
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,8,I say surprisingly good but not if you look at the depth of the cast. We saw it on regular television and put up with the adverts to see it through. Touching but not clichéd. Pleasant but not saccrine. Simple but not dumb. A bloody good watch.

" A Sad Attempt at Being Profound
",2019-11-26 00:00:00,2,"Why do I dislike this film so much? There are many reasons, running from nitpick to fundamental flaw, so I hope you understand that not every point I attempt to make is of equal weight in my mind.My main issue with this film is its laziness. This laziness comes in many forms, the first of which is in its writing. I'm sure to many people the writing will seem smart and enjoyable for the way things seem to click together with mirror images finding each other and completing each other in a variety of scenes. This does not take great skill to do. It's actually quite easy since you are in control of all the variables. What is difficult is creating dead ends, misdirects, character flaws, and personal failures that seem real, earned, and connect with the audience.Another sign of laziness in the film are the metaphors employed. Don't get me started on how lazy of a metaphor a domino is and it is used throughout the film. Used is a kind word, though. There are multiple scene that have dominos in them. They are never used to reveal anything, emphasize anything, or contribute to a single character's journeys or growth. Why even have them in the film?The reason everything clicks together nicely in this film is because it is simple and easily controlled. Most of the characters have a relationship with one person, Howard, and then one struggle in life in the form of another relationship or lack of one. As a result, their problems are easily fixed over the course of the film.Don't get me wrong, I love a simple plot, but only when its simplicity is used as a way of communicating inner complexity. This is a film that eschews complexity for the sake of simple answers and ephemeral easy feelings.This is a film that wants us to look at the silver lining in every dark cloud but doesn't ever let us get a real glimpse at the dark cloud. The answers it offers feel trite compared to real pain which most of us have endured. Showing us the story of this man's life falling apart might have made it hard to keep certain twists (which are forecast a mile away) and it might have made the movement of Howard's character more complicated but it would have felt a lot more true than never ever seeing the relationship he is missing or the circumstances of his pain and then having complete strangers speak to him about that pain in generalities.This film fails hard because they want to show us how beautiful the world is despite the pain we see but never lets us see the pain. The tacit message is that the pain must be forgotten, avoided, and not entered into. What could be more unhelpful than that.Heap on top of this the number of film school 101 hacky devices which get used in the film and you have a terrible movie that struggled to keep my interest in between rolls of my eyes. He writes letters to Death, Time, and Love? If I had a nickel for every story I've heard pitched where people represent concepts of emotions I'd have enough money to make a better film than this one.This film attempts to wrestle with real tragedy and pain in people's lives but, unfortunately, lacks the courage to look at those difficulties in an honest and meaningful way. It seems more interested in patting people on the back and saying, 'see, it all works out and there is beauty out there,"" than it is in giving audiences the experience of finding beauty in the midst of ugliness. That would take real skill in writing, acting, directing and might not make as much money. I know, all things that this film wasn't willing to put in for the sake of its own silver lining. The film makers seem to have forgotten that silver linings need dark clouds in order to shine brightly and one without the other just isn't as beautiful."

" The best invention has been love, time and death
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,7,"The best invention has been love, time and death, it really is not easy, there are many situations and convictions that do not reveal the collateral movements that are caused by an event in our lives. Most of us strive to control the result without seeing that everything around us, everything that happens around us is part of living. Perhaps the death of a mother or a brother could be used to represent the loss, but the human being is harmed more when it comes to a child. There are many events that can cause sadness, madness, desolation, without emabargo as long as it is not from your circle of belonging, it does not matter and there is the big problem. The story focuses on the loss of the most loved of people, but the unplanned birth of a baby can also cause collateral beauty."

" If I write a review, things are serious
",2019-10-29 00:00:00,9,"It feels like a warm hug or a punch in the stomach.. I've seen a lot of movies and nowadays I feel that I can predict storylines and endings.. But in this one it didn't cross my mind to predict another rather usual continue to the story. And even the two or three times I did, it proved me wrong. Now don't take it the wrong way, maybe if you have the same virus as me to predict movies and then feel a little disappointed, there is always possibilities you may find out the plot twists, before they happen, but until then I think you should give it a go. Not the predictions, the movie. I think it's worth your time.
Take some tissues by your side, you may need them."
" Weakass ending

" Will Smith is sad for 90 minutes
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,3,"Misguided, mean-spirited, melodramatic, and saccharine; Collateral Beauty is manufactured Oscar bait. The performances are all solid. Everything else is a disaster.Will Smith is our protagonist I guess? He doesn't do much but mope around teary-eyed the entire movie. Apparently his daughter died, but we never see their relationship and we don't know much about Will Smith's character before he's in complete mourning. The real plot is Ed Norton, Kate Winslet, and Michael Pena trying to squeeze him out of their company. They want to make Will Smith's character look crazy, so they hire three actors to portray love, time, and death. See, Howard (Will Smith) writes letters to love, time, and death, blaming them for his daughter's death and other general bad things, so their evil plan is to film Howard talking to the actors, then digitally remove the actors from the footage so it looks like Howard is talking to himself. That way, he'll be removed from the company and the three of them will get his equity.This movie doesn't work for many reasons. One, as I mentioned we really don't know Howard's character. He's sad. He cries a lot. He misses his daughter. He writes distraught letters to theoreticals. That's it. We're given no chance to relate to the character because his only characteristic is ""I'm sad"".Two, the trio of business partners are despicable. A lot of time is spent on them setting up scenarios to humiliate Howard and constantly colluding behind his back, yet we're asked to sympathize with them when they show Ed Norton's strained relationship with his daughter, or introduce the fact that Michael Pena is sick. Who cares? These are horrible people. They make very little effort in trying to console Howard or even talk to him. Everything is behind is back even though he's apparently the creative force of the company.Three, there is little to no interaction between Howard and the trio of scumbags. At one point Howard calls Whit (Norton) his best friend. Nothing in the movie indicated that they were friends, or even that they liked each other. They have one awkward interaction in the elevator, but we're just supposed to take the movie's word that they are dear friends. Howard spends most of his time with a girl he meets at a grief counseling class. We're barely given a chance to care about their relationship either because so much time is spent on the stupid business plot.There is only one scene that had all four main characters that I can remember and it was the ""climax"" of the film. Again, we care about none of these characters and what should feel cathartic just comes across as phony and contrived. This is a miserable movie that tries to come across as good-natured and profound. It's neither. It's grief porn, basically.I can't think of a single reason to recommend this movie. Maybe if you're trying to fall asleep, Collateral Beauty could help."
" Brilliant from start to finish!
",2019-10-04 00:00:00,10,I'm so glad I watched this film. It Is more than just a tearjerker it completely captures all your heart. Some of the most superb acting and cast. I completely recommend anyone watch this and I would seriously question someone who says it was a waste of time!
" Why did I wait so long to watch this??
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,10,"I am so glad I never take note of critics opinions. I had this on my watchlist but was always waiting for the right moment. As far as I'm concerned, a minority cannot speak for the majority and as part of the majority, I loved this movie. Very emotional, beautifully acted by all involved but Will really has a way of tapping into his emotions that draws the viewer in.I am very glad I finally gave this movie my attention."

" A Complete Disaster
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,1,"Will Smith together with a star-studded cast that includes Edward Norton,who rarely appears on movies nowadays being a difficult-to-work with actor,together with Kate Winslet,Helen Mirren,Mark Pena,Keira Knightley, Michael Pena, and Noami Harris in this film entitled,""Collateral Beauty"". It tells a story of an advertising executive who treated from life after experiencing a tragedy. His friends help him in order to help him to get back from his depressed state and become the same person again.Despite having a great cast,the film completely fails as it lacks a story and the execution of the plot was disastrous. Added to that,we also see how implausible it was as the people involved - the advertising executive and his friends - are able to control reality and are not susceptible to any circumstances at all. While the friends' intention were great, the execution of the film was done poorly. It only appeared to be both cheesy and melodramatic. It tried to evoke tears among the viewers but the lies that the friends do will prevent it from doing so.In summary,it was a complete disaster."
" A complete waste of good actors with bad story telling, direction and bad side actors.
",2019-09-03 00:00:00,1,"It was as if the movie was complete mechanical. The actors were given a script, they acted. Right emotional music played at the right time. A good amount of suspense was kept and a bit of twist was given at the end.It's like when someone new to cooking tries to cook food just according to the recepie and still the food tastes awful. I had the exact same feeling throughout the movie.If only the writers were a bit more deep, it would had fixed everything and instead of spending bucketload of money on getting the best two actors, it would had been much better if they had just got the whole crew to be average paid actors. Only two good actors mixex with so much bad acting just makes the whole movie terrible.I can write more in details but this movie was really good. Don't watch the movie because of the cast. Maybe this movie will appeal to people who have lost someone... eh... I still don't think this movie is for anyone at all."
" It doesn't get much love, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,8,"This kept reminding me of A Christmas Carol, with the central figure visited by three ghosts, our central figure, namely Will Smith, is visited by three beings, all sent, to turn his life around.I've not found a great deal of love for this film, and that surprises me, I very much enjoyed it. It had me moved to tears. The ending in particular hit hard.A great story, with some terrific performances, a terrific cast, including Helen Mirren and Kate Winslet. Despite the names, I must give full credit to Will Smith, the best performance I've seen from him to date, he had me choked up."
" A Three Tissue Film.

Simple but mind opening script, low budget no frills yet you will always always remember this film. Eight quite remarkable actors even Jacob Latimore whom I don't think I remember from his other films but I sure will do now. If you are not sentimental do not watch this film but if otherwise then this is a film you will always enjoy more than once, just don't forget the tissues."
" Superb. Made me cry a lot.
",2019-08-19 00:00:00,10,"I can't believe how shallow critics are. This film makes you explore your own hypocrisy, whether you have really reconciled to your family and your suffering. Therefore 10/10. Don't take the plot too seriously: look for the meaning. Thank you G-d for this film. Peace."
" Star studded family affair
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,6,"The story was quite predictable but the whole joy of watching this film was how natural everyone took their roles. It was as if nobody was actually 'acting', except for Will Smith.
Pure family fun."

",2019-08-05 00:00:00,10,"Richard Roper-Manila Dargis-Joe Morgenstern-many other film reviewers or people easy to talk into scientology because their Fing idiots rated this a bad movie. It dealt with a tragedy no parent wants to think about or face it/actors did a amazing job making the connection with love n loss n life after I guess film credits must also do the polls for who's going to win elections because it seems most people had a connection/good rating for the movie. The reviewers didn't or seemed to just copy what another wrote, maybe it's time to fire or stop letting them write in national press especially when they seem to also disagree with the mass majority of movie fans! How about 3 bad reviews that 90% of people who watch like you have to say that being a movie reviewer isn't for you! Just my thoughts"
" Brilliantly executed, so uplifting

" Weird feel good (?) drama
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,6,"Great cast and I would argue everyone is doing their best. The movie though has quite a few cliche traps - especially towards the end. Actually with an ending that ... well might break the movie for some watching. I'm guessing the negative reviews (at least some of them) had to do with that.Other than that, we have a Will Smith as a broken down person. With so many people around him that care, that you do wonder how and why he even needs more help. That is if you don't get that helping a person mentally is more than just difficult. But there is a selective ... view on things. That may make you question what you just witnessed (sorry for the puns, you might get them if you watch the movie). It also depends on if you can believe ""drama"" Will Smith - do you buy it when he is sad instead of happy go lucky? It's a tough sell and borderline at moments. He is a good actor overall but I would argue that he falls short in some critical moments. They are still good moments, because they are written well ... So overall decent and depending on your view on (after)life and other things you may like it more than others"
" Good writing, awful directing
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,7,"I think the director wants us to cry ourselves up from nothing, he wants us to question life but he did it in a wrong way, the pacing is good, the cast is great, but there're a couple of things missed, i hope they do a remake with the same cast but different director."
" Hard Movie To Review
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,7,"Collateral Beauty (2016)Plot In A Paragraph: A depressed, grieving father (Will Smith) writes to Time, Love and Death as he attempts to over come the death of his little daughter. He begins to question his sanity as all 3 come and pay him a visit in human form, as his 3 closest friends (Ed Norton Kate Winslet and Michael Peña) try to save his business.All is not what it seems with this movie, the trailer explains the plot as I have have done there, but that's not all there is to it, there are a few twists. After my second viewing, I still don't know if I like it. It is sort of like A Christmas Carol with him being visited by time, love and death instead of Christmas ghosts.Will Smith delivers another solid performance, and is heartbreakingly good as the distraught Dad, who is lost in grief. I love Helen Mirren, the woman can do no wrong in my book, Kiera Knightley and Ed Norton are both ok, and I always enjoy seeing Michael Peña on screen. You can see where it's going at times, and others you can't.It's certainly a hard one to review, without spoilers. And I don't want to ruin it for anyone who has not seen it.So, I'll just round off by saying the movie only grossed $31 million at the domestic box office (It did open on the same day as Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) to end the year, the 88th highest grossing movie of 2016."

I need to give it a second viewing, so I know for sure!! Without going into spoilers, the words selfish and cruel come to mind.I will say this.......Those dominoes must have took a hell of a lot of time to set up (They day it's 5 days in the movie)"

Thank you to the writer who brought creative imagery to the our human quest to make meaning as we flow through the challenges of relationships that change through loss, dying and letting go. Thank you for the poignantly penetrating dialogue supported by magnificent actors who transformed these characters into real life people I recognized, characters I have known and loved. This movie lives in my mind and enriches my life journey. Thank you for the gift of all the talent and energies of heart, mind and body that you have put into the making of this film. It resonates deeply and makes possible many conversations that are often so difficult that they remain unshared. Your work is love made visible and infuses courage and inspires a way of being that is healing for self and other. A great complement to Progoff's Intensive Journal Writing Workshop."
" Moving and tender
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,9,"Collateral Beauty bombed at the box office, but it's a fantastic movie. It's also extremely heavy and will make you go through an entire Kleenex box, so that might be why audiences didn't flock to the theaters to see it. Whenever you're in the mood for a good cry, rent a copy. The acting is wonderful and the story is intriguing and original.Will Smith stars as a grieving man whose life has fallen apart. His friends and business partners Kate Winslet, Michael Pena, and Edward Norton are worried about him, and they try to help him, in a very bizarre way. They hire three unemployed actors, Keira Knightley, Helen Mirren, and Jacob Latimore, to play Love, Death, and Time. They tell the actors how Will is grieving and they think with a spiritual intervention, he could get his life back on track.This film is so moving, clever, and emotional, and the all-star cast gives lovely layered performances. When given the opportunity to show his dramatic talents, Will Smith is always wonderful, so get ready for another display of raw emotions. It's a bit of a running joke in my house that I'm not the biggest Helen Mirren fan, but I love her in this movie. She's clever and doesn't ham up being a struggling actor, but instead makes the audience feel they're eavesdropping on her private conversations. Keira Knightley, whom I love, is tender and expressive, just as her character needs to be. In one of my favorite scenes, she approaches Will in a restaurant, sits at his table, and as her eyes well with tears, she declares, ""I am Love.""Rent this movie. Sure, it's an indie flick, but it doesn't feel like it. It's one of the better movies to come out of 2016."
" Honestly I'm blow away!
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,9,"This movie was phenomenal! The themes are beautiful and heart wrenching and so good all at the same time. First of all, the music in this film is incredible! The score is beautiful, and the soundtrack adds just the right feelings. From the very beginning of the movie with the song ""Way Down We Go"" by KALEO you get that sense of despair and disregard for life. You really begin to understand the pain Howard is feeling. The opening scene really hits you right where it hurts with the song and the dominoes falling down, showing just how impermanent things really are.
Also what an amazing cast! I have always loved Will Smith but he was spectacular in this movie! By including other big names like Kate Winslet and Keira Knightly I was intrigued from the beginning. I loved that even though the movie dealt with a specific kind of mourning it applied to all kinds, and the pain and ups and downs that come with loss of any kind.
I think there's so much you can learn from this movie, about life and death and pain and progress. The scene that has stuck in my head is Love's/Amy's speech to Howard about love. It's so powerful! And she's right. There's pain in loss, but there's love too; after all, you wouldn't miss it if you didn't really love it. It's so hard to find the good amidst the bad, but this movie shows some of the steps it takes to get there. They're not always easy, they're not comfortable, and the grief is normal, but there is light at the end of the tunnel if you look for it.
I agree that there are a few problems with the plot, but overall those were lost among the beauty and sweeping feelings of the film. Seeing Howard's development, seeing his extreme lows and what grief can really be like, carry the story so well that any inconsistencies seem unimportant. The plot had so many unanticipated twists and it was a pleasure to be shocked.
Overall, I would definitely recommend this movie! It's beautiful and painful all at the same time and it leaves you thinking about so much. Truly a wonderful movie despite what the critics say."
" Worth the watch if you like interpersonal Dramas
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,6,"I get the negative critic reviews, but I still think you should check it out if you're into Dramas.Tone - a little wishy washy, it's heartbreaking one minute, then there's some lighthearted crack the next.Performances - pretty good all around, especially Will Smith.Plot - this is where it kinda dips in quality. Felt a bit unfocused, there were subplots that maybe didn't need to be here due to the fact that they weren't all that fleshed out. Also, the ending could be a bit confusing to some (with the actors on the bridge, and then poof! You'll know what I mean if you've seen it). The little twist at the end though With Will Smith (before the final sequence) was really good and I actually wasn't expecting it.Story - Very heartwarming and relatable.Overall - Don't over analyze it and enjoy it if you like Dramas. If you're not into this kind of thing you should probably avoid it."

" It really made me question life... and not in a good way
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,2,"Collateral Beauty, directed David Frankel is a movie which really made me question life... and not in a good way. To explain to you how bad this movie is I need to just basically describe the plot. This review will contain spoilers but who cares, do not see this film. Okay so the movie starts out with Will Smith all happy and awesome starting up a successful business, giving a lame and generic speech. It then moves forward in time and Will Smith loses his daughter so therefore becomes a hermit with no personality. Now his business is in crisis because he does no work, so his ""FRIENDS"" who work for him hire a private investigator to break into the postal service and retrieve letters that he writes... Okay so his ""FRIENDS"" find out he's writing letters to Love, Death and Time, so they hire actors to play these three concepts. The actors confront Will Smith, in order to make him lose his temper in public. This was all filmed by the private investigator, who somehow digitally removes the actors, making Will Smith seem crazy, because it looks like he's yelling at no one. His ""FRIENDS"" now use this footage to get Will Smith kicked out of his business....... and then Will Smith thanks them....... Yep so this movie actually got made. This is what Edward Norton and Kate Winslet star in now. It's approach to loss and hardship is insensitive two dimensional, and unrealistic, so therefore I give Collateral Beauty a 2. And what does the title even mean, we never find out."

Then later appear in reality, personifying those 'characters', and discuss the letter he sent to them. Being so filled with grief, he actually believes he is seeing and interacting with these personifications that only he can see; cue their creativity. Even in a fictional movie that seems a bit preposterous.......they must have hired great actors. Ha. Will he come to grips with and work through his emotional state? I expected to have more emotional engagement and character concern than I did from the A-List cast. It was a clever core story nugget but it was shallowly written and plot devices didn't ring true."
" Wow wow wow What a beautiful story. Beautiful end of a movie.
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,9,What a beautiful story. Beautiful end of a movie. It's a bit slow in the beginning but it's a drama. Watch till the end.
" This movie is so underrated !
",2019-03-05 00:00:00,9,Touching and moving movie !!! I am so happy i watched it.
" Too many meaningless deep quotes
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,5,"First the good points, the big name cast more than live up to expectations. The music score is a nice mix of songs with some very Hans Zimmer'ish incidental music, in fact so much so, some of it sounds likes it's ripped directly from the Inception soundtrack!Ok, now bad points; I had high hopes for this film after reading some of the glowing reviews. Sadly it was wasted on me, and my wife. The whole concept of three actors playing love, death and time was just pointless and seemed to be of little relevance in the end anyway. The film is full of deeply emotional scenes containing what are supposed to be highly prophetic lines, but to be honest, it's like somebody copied & pasted a load of cheesy facebook memes into the script. The worst of all is 'Collateral beauty', sorry but it's just meaningless!
God forbid, if I had lost a child I think I would probably find this quite patronising."
" I'm glad I watched this :)
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,10,"This movie is really one of the most amazing movies to watch. Its about love,time and death and how these effect a person's life .This movie is a great representation of how someone get depressed or gives up on life if something really bad happens to them and how love and time can help a person overcome these situations .And how if a person gives up on life can effect the life of the people around him .It also shows the way to get out of situations like this ,by talking to other people and by thinking about the beautyfull things in your life life to move on instead of being stuck with the horrible things in the past."
" People who are criticising this movie must have a heart of stone
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,10,"I signed up to write my first review on IMDb ever just because I am amazed how people would not speak highly of this wonderful movie! And I want people to know that this is sooooo worth to see!Omg I cried my eyes out watching this and I feel so deeply touched by the acting, the plot(twists), the story on its own. The deeper meaning. I mean how can you not love this movie???? It just touched my heart really.The IMDb rating and critics on here changed my perspective on IMDb. I probably wouldn't have watched this movie if I would've checked IMDb first.. but I didn't. It was a random choise on Netflix and absolutely loved it! I was just curious to see what people had to say about it.Ignore the lower ratings, hold on to your loved ones and go watch this beautiful movie!!"
" Ok I suppose.
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,7,Ok so I get the movie. I already realised the 3 were actually indeed Love Death and time shortly after the character that plays 'time' had far too much wisdom for his age.So as I was piecing this all together I thought hmm the writers probably assume most people haven't caught this 'twist' yet. But I did. Then comes the second twist. The fact Madeline was his wife! Yeah yeah I get it after looking back over the movie...the moment Madeline mentioned she had a 6 year old die (coincidence that Howard had a child for at 6 too).BUT why did they act like they never knew each other? I don't get this bit whatsoever. It's almost like the writers wanted a double twist but had no idea how to make it work.
" One of the best movies I have ever seen....
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,10,"A solid cast of talented actors is not always a guarantee for sucsess,but this one surely is. This movie took my breath away and moved me deeply. Such a beautiful story,played out with the calm and professional manor one will expect form such an experienced cast. This is a story of life,love,pain and with no sugarcoating at all,just a brillant way of telling a story that will stay with me forever. To the person who wrote this story; thank you!"
" Philosophy can be entertaining!
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,8,"I became interested in watching this movie after seeing a preview for it on another DVD I had borrowed. This piqued my interest, seeing the 3 people portraying Love, Death and Time. We saw that the Will Smith character was depressed, but didn't know exactly why.The movie itself seemed to start off quite slow, but it did show us the before and after of ""Howard's"" emotions after the major event in his life, which we eventually learn about in flashbacks and such. Each of the main characters had issues which needed resolving or at least being able to live with in a positive manner. The ending did totally surprise me - I didn't see it coming at all. Brought a tear or two to my eyes, which doesn't happen easily. Will Smith did a great job here, proving he can do more than just comedy or action flicks. Well worth the 90+ minutes of time to watch!"
" Emotionally penetrating drama
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,9,"This emotionally penetrating drama while focusing on the intense bereavement of Wil Smith's character also incorporates three parallel personal stories of three other characters. The movie echoes some of Wil Smith's earlier dramatic mystery from Seven Pounds (2008). The first third of the movie carefully, though somewhat oddly balances a surprisingly, well- crafted wry sense of humor in some of the dialogue which also subsequently oddly dissipates. Not an easy movie to watch, Collateral Beauty offers nevertheless up a rather mystical tone reminiscent of The Fisher King (1991), K-Pa (2001) that allows the audience to experiencing both deep sadness as wells as curiosity. In the superb fashion of Nomad (1986) and Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), director David Frankel achieves a fine ambivalence as the nature of the movie' ultimate genre that Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (2011) chose not to follow but with still glowing satisfaction. The movie hits hard on one of the most profound human experiences that people inevitably face and does so with commendable results."
" Very good approach
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,5,"This film could have been so much better. Insteat of letting this film a little magic touch they want actors to play death, time and love. That ruined the hole film !!!
In my opinion that film could be one of the best of the world when they had just made film like trailer."
" Such a great movie with a deep story
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,10,"People who wrote negative comments didn't know the meaning of life.
It's too deep to explain, so go watch it!"
" Great actors, poor dialogs, boring story
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,5,Wasn't easy for me to watch it until the end... melodramatic story with a strange twist and a cheesy end
" Not impressed
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,4,"If you lost someone you might get emotional watching it, but the movie is filled with illogical loopholes, if you start to ponder about them you won't like the movie."
" brilliant !
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,10,Amazing movie... why all this negative criticism ? people have no glue. it's straight brilliant. meaningful with big emotions. a must see movie !!
" Beautiful movie
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,9,"Well acted. Very well acted. Well directed. Decent script. Beautiful story. Worth your time. If I can have some critique: the actors and sets look way too polished. I can see all the star's individual trailers and their makeup artists are all over their faces. So yeah, visually too polished. But it's a lovely movie. A lovely story. Some great acting. 8,5 out of 10 (although a 4 for the too polished look). Go watch it."
" Just brilliant
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,9,"Was not sure what to expext apart from a great line up of actors. What a surprise, a happy one. Depth and intelligent and again it shows Will Smith's multi talented acting. Glued to the screen and it felt like being in the theater looking at an old play in a new setting."
" Boring
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,4,"There are some films that earn the predicate BORING .. and this is definitely one. A real boring plot and boringly acted.
I would definitely have wasted my money if I'd payed to watch it in a cinema."
" Powerful movie
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,10,Only reason I can understand people being critical about this movie is if they don't like Drama movies. It's an incredible powerful movie and Will is amazing in it. Get out those tissues and see this one!
" Why all the hate?
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,8,"I'll be the first to admit that this movie wasn't 10/10 and it won't be a classic, but it is one of the better movies about real life. Because that's what it is. Real life. Real grief. Real pain. Real loss. Real life. It definitely had me in tears more than once and left an impact I'll feel for the rest of the day. And it'll make me hug my children a bit harder when they come home.
Definitely worth your time."
" Perfection
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,9,"I gave it 9 not 10 just to leave a space for a challenge. 
The is the perfect drama movie, am glad i listen to the reviews and watched it. 
Acting was so good to the level you live with them.
The story has many dimensions that's all deep and warm.
The closure is a beauty by itself.Guys this a 10 marks for it here."
" Enjoy it at face value
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,7,"I often feel it must be difficult to be a film critic. Yes it seems an easy job just watching films and then writing a review. But they always need an angle. They HAVE to write something, so it's difficult for them to just take a film at face value. Many films which are thought of as classics can also be viewed as schmaltzy or manipulating. But sometimes it's ok just to enjoy a film and be taken wherever it wants to take you for 90 minutes. I watched this on a cold damp Sunday evening and enjoyed it for what it was. An enjoyable story of someone dealing with almost suicidal grief. It's a story of love and loss and how that love and loss is so different when it's the love of a child rather than a love between husband and wife/boyfriend and girlfriend. We all had a life before we met our loved ones. We all had a life before our children but the arrival of the latter changes us in a way that means a return to the life we led before is impossible when the child is taken away. With a break up or divorce we may meet someone else, maybe develop an even better relationship. Not so with the loss of a child. This film deals with that loss which is felt so deeply it consumes Will Smiths character making life seem worthless. Watch it without judgement. A film that makes you think about life and love and loss and how to cope is worthy in itself without being judged in an overly critical way."
" Solid 7.1
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,7,I reall y enjoyed this movie. It had a great twist and kept my glued to the screen the whole 90 minutes.I love reading some of the bad reviews as it becomes apparent they missed major parts of the movie or they just didn't get it. It is comical the way some of their minds thinkOver all 7.1
" Interesting
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,6,The review would be higher if there was a different ending.
" My life changed by this
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,10,"Love,Time,Death.every single man in this world struggle by these things.its okay to be humans by this.howard was great buisnesman.no matter how successful you are love time death can drag you down.howard was fallen by these things.if you ever felt despert.if you felt your life hasnt a meaning.i invite you to watch this beautifull movie.at least it will give you a hope to rise."
" Fantastic Movie.
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,10,"Thank God I have watched this movie without seeing the critics review otherwise I would have missed the masterpiece.
Excellent movie with the amazing cast.Loved every minute of the movie and it's in all time favorite list."
" Collateral Beauty - Spoiler Free Review
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,8,"I definitely, definitely tend to be in the minority on this one, but I actually really loved this movie. I've kinda lost my interest in Will Smith in recent years, but in this movie he proves that he is still an incredible actor. The movie not only explores what happens to families and individuals after the loss of a child, but also how their reactions affect the people around them, asking the very valid question of whether your friendship with one, and your understanding of his ordeal, is enough to not only allow it to wreck your own life, but also the lives of all others counting on that person. The supporting cast, although not quite comparing to Will Smith, all offer strong performances (with the strange exception of Edward Norton who does seem kind of wooden here), and all play a pivotal role in sending the audience on an emotional journey, which really does talk to you, especially if you've had experience in losing one really close to you. Overall, critics are hating this movie, audiences are hating this movie...but I'm going to keep on defending it, because at the very least, I can say I definitely felt it."
" Beautiful.
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,9,"You get invested in the characters and their stories. This movie will get you in your feelings, chew you up and then spit you back out. Wish there were more films like this."
" Astonishing..
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,10,"One of the BEST movies..
Well Written, Well Directored & Well Acted."
" So under-rated
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,10,"I loved the emotional roller coaster and amazing acting by Will Smith. Every time i saw his expression, i could feel the pain, the grief.This movie deserves a better rating. Did anyone from the critics get paid to sabotage the rating?"
" Simple but deep story
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,9,"It's just amazing these emotions when you feel it together in one movie, it's a simple story but the way it was been told and dramatically displayed just amazing, u realize an unfolded fact only by the end of the movie and it's really nice , I enjoyed watching the movie very much."
" Worth a watch
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,9,I don't remember this being in the theatres but gave it a try on a streaming service due to the cast. Definitely worth watching.
" A subtle message....probably missed by most
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,9,"Time, love and death are part of each human story. Time can be a sentence or it can help heal wounds. Love is best given freely and with meaning. Death is an old white woman. Will Smith gives a mature and moving performance in this movie. I liked the messages in this movie."
" Simple, yet touching
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,9,"A fantastic ensemble and a touching story. I really enjoyed watching this movie and as a father I cannot imagine anything worse than losing a child. But it's more to this movie than that, see it!"
" Started slow but came together in the end
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,6,"This movie started out kind of slow but really came together in the end. Definitely worth a viewing, by the time you finish you'll want to watch it again to see if you can catch on to everything as it is happening."
" Life and Death
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,10,"Intense and the meaning of peace is searched at a deeper level; understanding relationships like father and son or father and daughter because of interest towards their thesis. The thesis statement is that Collateral Beauty exists and we move on: finding sources to interest us like books and exercises. 
Damage to organs are a suitable place to start in existence because from the earliest days of humanity organs failed or were made to fail through wars but here we can explore the meaning of preserving those moments by excepting that peace governs us. 
Peace to countries like Pakistan from India; peace to call them home. Peace to bring soldiers in foreign lands home; because troubles like being in an air raid because the government is under terrorist ties brings nations like France and United States of America to perform strikes on Lebanon and Syria. 
Regimes are overthrown by the space of a decade and peace prevails but being in the third world it is hard to bring home the effects that we are peaceful like the countries of the first worlds. Relevant points of searching for life after death through means of peace can be traced to primal humans because they were in the moment. 
Momentary gain like achieving a pass mark in an exam brings joy and peace contrary to violence and disobedience under Boko Haram or Al Quaida. Terrorism does not exist; finding a terrorist within brings another to share your basic life style. 
Life and Death; theatrical proof of the failure to conquer death."
" Heartwarming, BYO tears!
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,9,"I did not think of this as a movie for Christmas. But, it reminds you of the importance of family, and loved ones. Like the tagline says, the three important things are love, time, and death. I could not pick a single performance by any cast member as better than others, but Keira Knightley, and Naomie Harris are superb."
" Connection, Hope and Aspiration - a near perfect movie
",2018-07-22 00:00:00,10,"I read a few of the reviews on here, some raves and some pans. It is obvious that this is one of those films that jars you one way or the other. Some are over the moon with the emotional connection of the movie. Others don't connect to it at all. I am of the former, over the moon. I watched it on a plane and found myself in tears by the end, but because I felt hope, absolute unadulterated hope. It's not about death, though some have said as much. It's not about money or acting or any of that. It's about life and the reason to go on, irrespective of what tragedy we face or what difficulty we're going through. It's about finding purpose in a seemingly purposeless world. I think some people see the all-star cast and expect something more that a character driven idea, but the best films connect with their viewers and nothing more. This film jarred me out of myself and made me think that faith in the universe is not such a bad idea. I won't disparage those that didn't get it/connect to it or the jaded viewers who think a deeply emotional film is innately laced with cheese. I will only say that very few films make you think and this one did all that and more."
" Beautiful. Flawless acting.
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,10,Beautiful film. The best Mr. Smith 's acting work I have seen yet.
" Took me completely by surprise. A really uplifting and engaging film!
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,9,"I ended up watching this by accident. There was nothing on tv, Good Will Hunting was nearly over, but this had just started, 3 mins in. I had seen an ad for this before and thought it looked contrived and cliche. But the ads don't do it justice, it took me completely by surprise! It is a really beautiful story about a Father grieving for the death of his daughter. A storyline done before but I have never seen another film or book approach it in this way, it is incredibly uplifting and engaging. Be prepared to cry as it is emotional (and I hate to cry at films but you cant help but cry at this!) The acting was great, perfectly cast, the music added to the story without distracting from it, and cinematography was beautiful, gorgeous shots of New York. I highly recommend! This should have gotten more credit, a really wonderful gem."
" Much to recommend it
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,8,"Howard (Will Smith) is a high-powered and committed ad executive, driven by the interaction between Love, Time and Death. When his daughter dies, there is nothing left in Howard's life. He writes letters to Love, Time and Death, but doesn't function at work any more, leaving his three partners at a loss as to how to save the business crashing. When Death, Time and Love turn up in person and respond to Howard's letters, will this provide him with a way out of his grief?The first thing to mention is that this is another film which leaves a key plot element out of the trailer - indeed, in some respects, the trailer is downright misleading - and the developments from this element are one of the joys of this movie. Parallels are drawn between the personifications of Death (Helen Mirren), Time (Jacob Latimore) and Love (Keira Knightley) and the circumstances of Howard's partners (Michael Pena, Kate Winslet and Edward Norton), who have personal issues with Death, Time and Love at their hearts.But even without that wrinkle, the movie is highly engaging. The script is good. It may not ring with resounding wordplay, but it is constantly thoughtful and thought-provoking and - surprisingly given that the film's overpowering theme is bereavement - it is often quite amusing.Naomie Harris plays the leader of a Child Bereavement self-help group which Howard eventually attends after loitering outside on numerous occasions, and maybe she will be able to help him make sense of these meetings with individuals who may - or may not - be figments of his imagination. The movie plays with fantastic elements while never losing site of the raw reality of bereavement which lies at its core.It's not fair to say that the film resolves Howard's issues - that would indeed be glib - but the film does resolve itself, and there is a degree of glibness in how it does so.Even so, the film tackles a difficult subject and does so in an engaging and compassionate way, entertains throughout its length, and leaves you with much to mull over in quiet contemplation or in empassioned conversation.An unusually thoughtful and intelligent movie."
" A movie to touch your heart & soul
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,10,A movie hasn't moved me this much since Sophie's Choice.
" When critics jump on the hate wagon.
",2018-04-30 00:00:00,8,"Unfortunately this film fell into the hate wagon of critics. It's so disappointing when A good film falls victim to one in, all in.Such a beautiful film and the concepts are interesting. It's not a movie that has been over done and it's ideas are new and interesting which is why the reviews baffle me. 
It does have moments of pulling at the heart strings but what's so wrong with that? It brings out our emotions and really gets you questioning, how would I feel if I lost someone? How would I cope? Who would I blame? Imagine if we could speak to death, love..ect. What would you say to them?It's a though provoking film and the ending is beautiful and well thought out. It's a little surprise but one that brings it all together Another near flawless preformance by Will Smith and the supporting actors all bring their own quirk to the screenSo glad I picked this up, definitely a movie to remember. So don't listen to the critics, give it a chance."
" A key... to unlock sadness?
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,8,"Wondering why this film was so terribly panned? Wondering if the reviewers are repressing loss and sadness and too uncomfortable to watch? If you are moving through sadness, this film may be a key to unlock... As it was for me, to allow me to release some of the pain I was holding, and perhaps let go... Or see things differently. Sometimes a film is much more as a whole, then just the sum of its flawed parts?"
" This film is *Beauty* that touches you
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,10,"Towards the end of the film, when you realize that beauty is unstoppable and it permeates everything, especially when you are not even aware of it at first... that's when your entire being smiles and says, Yes, thank you to the makers of this film I'm watching.And then you laugh at the critics and think ""figures..."" They didn't get it.I could write a review with spoilers and marvel at the experience that this film is. But I won't. Just do yourselves a favor and watch it. You won't be sorry."
" The Most Manipulative Film in a Very Long Time
",2018-03-20 00:00:00,4,"Although January has been known to be the dumping ground for films that studios don't believe in, December has also become that month as well. Yes, December and January is usually when you can go to any cinema and find a handful of films that will be nominated for #Oscars, ensuring your satisfaction at the movies. Having said that, smaller studio films are placed next to a huge blockbuster, because they don't know where else to place it. After seeing a few trailers for Collateral Beauty it truly made me think it was going to be a very enjoyable time at the theatre. Sadly, there is a reason that it was released alongside Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, not due to the fact that it wanted to compete for best quality, but because it really won't end up finding a huge fanbase. Why? Collateral Beauty is one of the most manipulative films I have seen in a long time. Let's dive in. Minor spoilers to follow. Read at your own risk. The plot of this film will be jarring to explain for those who don't know, because the trailers have technically been lying to you. Making it out to be a happy-go-lucky film about a man who has lost a child and is visited by embodiments of love, time, and death, Collateral Beauty masks its actual story, which really is about a man who is grieving the loss of his daughter, but also is about to lose his company, due to lack of focus. His employees gather together and hire actors to portray the embodiments of love, time, and death in order to stoop to his level after he writes letters to these ""things."" Not only is this a very mean-spirited film in my personal opinion, but it also takes away the magic of what the trailers advertise, even if that story would have been cheesier. If I had to choose between a mean-spirited or a sappy film, I would have choose sappy every day of the week. Although I have to admit that I disliked this film overall, the biggest compliment I can give Collateral Beauty, is the fact that it kept pulling me back in, due to the terrific performances. Everyone in this film seems to be giving it their all here, especially Will Smith. He is a man of very few words here, but his expressions and few scenes of complete mental and emotional breakdowns were truly heartbreaking. Helen Mirren, Keira Knightley, Michael Pena, Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Naomi Harris, and Jacob Latimore all give commendable performances, and play off of each other in quite a believable way. Sadly, looking back on this film, these performances are what made this bore of a film watchable. Sure, the film is competently made, but there was so much room for expansion. The most frustrating aspect about Collateral Beauty was the amount of side stories with every character. The core story here is about Howard (Will Smith), but everyone else receives just as much screen time as him in order to develop their relationships outside of work. These people are supposed to be his friends, yet they do a very mean thing to him, and yet we are also supposed to care about their personal lives, while the story needs you to care about Howard the most. On top of that, just so that the film can have a big reveal in its final act, Howard's backstory is completely glossed over and given to the audience periodically throughout the film. This made the film extremely messy and I hardly found myself emotionally invested in any of it. In the end, Collateral Beauty it far too manipulative to fully enjoy and although I undoubtedly admired the fact that this is an original film, it was too messy to connect with me. I didn't like this film very much, but the performances are all terrific and while they do belong in a better film, that is the sole aspect that kept latching me on. I was able to grasp onto a few elements and Will Smith made me shed a tear for an instant, but only due to the fact that he committed himself to this role. The story itself is completely lacking depth and should have stuck with a more spiritual route in my opinion. It is competently directed by David Frankel, but sloppily constructed by writer Allan Loeb, who has actually made a couple films I have enjoyed in the past, such as 21. I found myself going back and forth between liking and disliking Collateral Beauty, but in the end, it is completely forgettable and I'll probably never find myself revisiting it. I can't get myself to recommend this film to anyone, but if you are a fan of any of these actors, you'll at least enjoy their performance. This is a mediocre premise that needed some tweaking, but ultimately even falls short of that pedestal as a whole."
" So much acting
",2018-03-13 00:00:00,4,"Everyone is acting so hard. Right in front of the cameras. They are doing all their acting tricks. They are saying all these lines. Someone put so much effort into every line. Too much effort?It is all about emotion, but everything is so in-human. Nothing sounds like a human might have ever said it. Everyone speaks with such singular purpose: to do some acting. No small chat. No warming up for the big emotive message.The ambient sounds feel oppressive. The music feels like it is trying to make you fall into a dream-state.I don't understand why people love this movie, but I am happy for them."
" Ideas about What Happened
",2018-03-12 00:00:00,6,"I didn't really enjoy this movie, but then like often happens later that night ideas start bouncing around and I can see something a bit deeper that redeems it. I have not seen reviewers mention these ideas so I thought I would write them up here in case it helps others appreciate them (or reject them if mis-thought).This involves the overall plot, so is all spoilers.When I watched it, I thought the story was stupid, how the people acted was silly, and that it was just a waste of time and talent. I sad guy is manipulated by his friends to try and get him to sell the company. The lady in the help group was actually his wife, that is kind of cool but then the lady on the chair when the daughter is passing is actually the old actor, stupid coincidence.But then its not, because now I believe the three actors were actually Love, Time and Death. Might have been manifestations or in someones head.Could have been they manifested for the three partners, who all had their connections with each: Absent father who needed to be forced back into loving his daughter, the dying man who needed to come to terms with death, the aging woman whose time to have a child has passed. In this scenario Howard may have had no need for them, he was already on his way to recovery, it is the three partners who needed them.Or it could have all been in Howard's head, the partners never contracted anyone, he imagined it all as a way to talk with these concepts and find his way through the grief and realize the needs of his partners, to find a way to help them.Clues: 
the direct connection between each contracted actor and the partner they interact with.the way they appear on the bridge but are not really there.the impossible situation of the the older actor being in the hospital with the wife.the video with them digitally edited out, possible but would be really difficult.I think no-one else in the movie interacts with the three constructs except Howard and the three partners?"
" I love happy endings
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,10,"I'm a sucker for a happy ending. They are very rare in movies with black casts and leads. Beautiful happy ending with him and his wife being able to reconcile and heal from mourning their daughters loss and his eventual journey to acceptance of the truth. Its great how the wife gave him his space, knew his condition and let him come back to her and recognize her on his own terms but never gave up on him."
" Collateral Beauty can be best described as misguided.
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,5,"I can see the intentions of the story, I admire the subject that it's trying to tackle (that being child loss). Somehow, this fell short and unfortunately is a mess. Howard has a promising start to life. Tragically though, he loses his daughter to an illness and slowly his life begins to crumble. He writes letters to three abstractions of life: Love, Death and Time. His work colleagues notice this, and hire three actors to portray the physical representations of these abstractions in an attempt to help him...therapeutically I guess. That's all well and good, but when you use grief and bereavement as a plot device it should be handled with care. In this, they make the protagonist feel like he has mental issues so that his ""friends"" can continue working in the company. Call me old fashioned or sensible, but that's not ok. Suffering is a horrible process, Will Smith excellently conveys this and actually makes quite a powerful performance. Yet, beneath the narrative is this weird jolly undertone that makes it seem like you're watching a romantic comedy. If this was made ten or twenty years ago, it could've had a place. Now though? No. Evidently what attracted audiences was its stellar cast consisting of Will Smith, Kate Winslet, Helen Mirren, Edward Norton, Naomie Harris, Keira Knightley...and more! It just keeps going! To be fair to them, they were all good. The preachy script about time, love and death just doesn't help them. Literally. ""I wish I had more time so I can love and not fear death, but time is running out and time time timeeeeeee."" Then the last five minutes happen and it's just nonsensical. Direction was solid, the whole film was well shot and was nice to look at. But...not enough I'm afraid. Watchable, it's not entirely a collateral mess. Oh, and what even is Collateral Beauty!? Stupid title. What's worse, is that they try to explain it in the film. Urghhhhh."
" Wow, talk about beauty.
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,10,"This movie was a complete surprise in that I didn't expect to love it. Not long into it I figured out the hook, but it was all well done and completely worth my time. Beautiful piece of artwork. Cathartic, poignant, emotional. Well done."
" If art is meant to make you think and feel, this movie hits the mark
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,9,"There are many negative reviews of this movie. Things like screenplay and some other things I do not quite understand or even care about.
The movie does hit the mark in that it really stirs your thoughts and emotions.
I watched this movie over 2 months ago, and I cannot tell you how many times I have caught myself thinking about the movie! There are layers after layers. What a fantastic film! 
If you want something all processed and chewed up for you, then this probably isn't for you. If you want a story that makes you evaluate your own life, and makes you think about your own circumstances (without providing answers I might add) this is perfect. The answers are yours to find and are not included in the movie btw. 
Lastly, the acting: Smith, Norton, Pena, and Knightly, wow! Excellent! 
Smith however was simply astonishing. I really felt for him throughout the movie. I know he was acting, but I sincerely wanted to reach into the screen and give that poor man a hug. 
Watch this movie. Thank me later."
" A Beautiful Film
",2018-01-27 00:00:00,10,"A wonderful film from beginning to end, it has a very nice storyline and a wonderful ending. A masterpiece."
" Ignore The Critics - Its Not What You Think
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,10,"Some of you may have seen the understated adverts for Collateral Beauty during its release in 2016. I remember seeing them and thinking, its just another of those feel good comedy films thats not really that special, why should I watch this one? Consequently, I didn't watch the film until now.Having recently seen this appear on streaming services I thought, what have I got to lose except the 93 mins run time it has and, to be honest, I can even do something while watching if it is that bad.Well, how wrong I was! I am genuinely glad I watched this film and found myself hooked by the end. I strongly recommend it, especially if you liked films like Seven Pounds, also featuring Will Smith.Don't get me wrong the start of this film leaves you with a lot of questions and not a lot of answers. The key character, Howard Inlet played by Will Smith, is so aloof I even found myself questioning if he was indeed the lead character. Surrounded by a bumper crop of great actors and actresses such as Helen Mirren, Edward Norton, Keira Knightley, Kate Winslet, Naomie Harris, Michael Pena and Jacob Latimore, you worry that this is a film that will either deliver in spades or not at all and unfortunately the start makes you feel the latter is about to happen.However, if you stick with this film until around two thirds through you will start to realise that everything that has happened is a mixture of great storytelling and script writing by Allan Loeb and fantastic acting choices, notably by Naomie Harris, Kate Winslet and Will Smith who I personally think delivers one of his finest acting performances ever. Knowing that this story was incredibly close to Will Smith due to the passing of his father and realising how much risk he took on in doing this role at such an emotionally vulnerable time simply heightens the respect I have for an already huge role model for me. What this also brings to the film is a level of depth in his character that at times I am sure is nothing short of actually real.One of the great things that stood this film apart for me by the end was the sheer level of depth that the characters had. Discovering this depth was a charm rather than being instantly revealed. It was discovered in small drips and drabs which created a completely believable reality that the actors really brought you into with their performances of these unique individuals. So refreshing not to be spoon fed the characters histories in the first 5 minutes in a poor attempt to make them appear deep.By the end of the film I was hooked and bordering on being an emotional wreck. Yes, real men cry too. There were genuine points where I had no idea what characters were going to do and I was riveted to the screen without a thought of doing anything else. Theodore Shapiro creates a unique and hugely haunting soundtrack that complements the tough, gritty moments on screen and simply heightens the emotional connection with the film. Even as a stand-alone album, the soundtrack is great to listen to.So, should you watch this film? If you do, stick with it to the end. There will be those that simply don't enjoy this genre and type of film, simply check rotten tomatoes to prove this and I have no problem with people feeling that way, I won't force you to watch something that doesn't appeal. Although I will say, this film is not your average, its clever, deep and carries some great emotional layers and storytelling that I think if you are prepared to go with it, you will be pleasantly surprised.I look forward to watching this again and it is definitely firmly found its place in my Bluray cabinet. Please don't let the scores on review sites and the adverts put you off.Pleasant watching!"
" Collateral Beauty is proof that professional reviews don´t always get it right.
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,9,"I´m really glad I watched this film and that it gets to be my first review on IMDb. I think that the message it leaves behind is great; I ended up feeling hopeful. Appreciate the gift of time and seek for love beacause it´s always there even if you can´t see it clearly. Will Smith gave an incredible performance, I reckon all the actors did so. The plot was clever and even though it isn´t an exhilarating action film, it has some twists that make it very exciting at the end. It was beautiful and romantic and painful. It makes you reflect on life and how we should live it fully and enjoy its beauty, even at our darkest moments. Go watch it, I doubt you´ll regret it!"
" It is a beautiful film. Watch it.
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,10,"Honestly, i don't understand why this film has a low rating. 
It's very emotional and it's really well-filmed. 
Every actor has lived his/her part. If you love to feel, don't miss out!"
" Where is the ""Collateral Beauty""?
",2018-01-11 00:00:00,7,"Apparently, this film has been slaughtered by the critics. While I have long learned not to pay any attention to the professional reviews, I must admit this one comes as a bit of a surprise. Not an earth-shattering experience by any means, but a truly good movie none the less. It captivates attention from the off - not with action or chase sequences, but with an idea; not with special FX, but some truly masterful performances from the cast.This movie will keep your attention throughout, and unless your name is Hercule Poirot, you're probably in for a massive surprise at the very end - the kind of surprise that will ensure this movie, and its message, endure in your memory beyond the time it takes you to walk back to your car from the theatre. You will find yourself speechless for a while when its done, left to ponder the ramifications on what you have discovered, retracing every step of the story with this new insight - and it will make you appreciate how good the acting (and the writing!) was even more.Back to the title - Collateral beauty - where is it, exactly? If I'm not mistaken, the underlying message of the movie is the following: In every tragedy, there is hidden, unintended beauty, that comes as a direct consequence of said tragedy. Unless I have completely misinterpreted the central premise of the movie, I do not think it delivers what it purports to do. More to the point - what is the collateral beauty in the death of his daughter?Nevertheless, for some strange reason, while an omission such as this one would have normally left me annoyed to the point of completely ruining the experience , it doesn't seem to bother me one tiny bit. Good movie, can recommend it."
" Another film I haven't heard of that turns out to be worth the time
",2018-01-10 00:00:00,9,"I took out this DVD from the library because it had Will Smith on the cover. I didn't even notice the other actors. Does Will Smith do a bad film? No. He obviously chooses his roles wisely and gives a great performance. He so embraces his part and makes you feel the pain Inlet is going through. All the actors are very good, especially Michael Pena and Dame Mirren. Well worth the time. This should become another holiday (NYC) film to watch."
" Completely Misunderstood By Negative Reviewers
",2018-01-06 00:00:00,10,"Ok, this will be my first IMDB review. Having said that... this isnt really a review it is an attempt to make people understand the film. So let me just say this... its a great film. Go see it.I felt compelled to review this movie as I find it astounding that so many negative reviewers have completely misinderstood the plot.
Let's just focus on the two main points that negative critics focus on...1. Negative critics in the majority claim this movie is a gross portayal of emotional manipulation performed on a trio of friends to another. Without denying that the trio have been driven to concocting this loopy plan to translate love death and time into real beings, lets not forget the lightbulb moment for this plan came when Kiera Knightleys character 'Love' caught Ed Nortons attention and duped him into following her back to a 'theatre' where the three soon to be employed 'actors' including Kiera Knightley are rehearsing. SPOILER: CRITICS YOU SEEM TO HAVE MISSED THAT THOSE THREE ACTORS ARE ACTUALLY ANGELS!!! THEY ARE THE ONES PERFORMING THE MANIPULATION. AND THEY ARE DOING SO TO HELP THE THREE FRIENDS DEAL WITH HUGE ISSUES IN THIER LIVES!!! AS WELL AS WILL SMITHS.Let's get this straight. The friends are manipulating no one. The angels are manipulating if you must call it that... although it isnt that, its helping the friends to deal with thier issues and to look at thier own lives and problems WHILST ensuring Will Smiths life is put back on track. The 3 friends of Will are completely led down a garden path by these angels in a beautiful way and for incredibe reasons. I feel some critics do not have the emotional IQ to have understood this. Or even actual IQ. I saw one critic question why others could not see the characters of 'love' 'time' and 'Death'... they are angels mate... and can be seen by whomever they want, whenever they want. Jeez Helen Mirren even says it!!!2. The second point to make is that people think the film misconstrued how grief and love is felt! HA! HILARIOUS. Who are these people to say how everyone would deal with certain emotions. Who are they to say how every person would deal with the rekindling of a romance that has been extinguished for a prolonged period over extremely strenupus circumstances. They are no one thats who. This is a FILM made about this particular group of peoples struggle with emotion. If you want a genuine reflection of how people deal with grief and love go stand outside a funeral home as well as a church and ask people how they feel as they come out. This is a wonderful story about a mans struggle to reconnect with life and the intervention of spiritual beings.And thats just it for me. Why do movies these days have to contain other worldly, hard to understand plots that create more questions than answers these days? Whats wrong with good old fashioned story telling. Which is exactly what this is. Its beautiful."
" Not Sure If I Liked It Or Not
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,7,"Continuing my plan to watch every Will Smith movie in order, I come to Collateral Beauty (2016)Plot In A Paragraph: A depressed, grieving father (Will Smith) writes to Time, Love and Death as he attempts to over come the death of his little daughter. He begins to question his sanity as all 3 come and pay him a visit in human form, as his 3 closest friends (Ed Norton Kate Winslet and Michael Peña) try to save his business.All is not what it seems with this movie, the trailer explains the plot as I have have done there, but that's not all there is to it, there are a few twists. After my second viewing, I still don't know if I like it. It is sort of like A Christmas Carol with him being visited by time, love and death instead of Christmas ghosts. Will Smith delivers another solid performance, and is heartbreakingly good as the distraught Dad, who is lost in grief. I love Helen Mirren, the woman can do no wrong in my book, Kiera Knightley and Ed Norton are both ok, and I always enjoy seeing Michael Peña on screen. You can see where it's going at times, and others you can't.It's certainly a hard one to review, without spoilers. And I don't want to ruin it for anyone who has not seen it. So, I'll just round off by saying the movie only grossed $31 million at the domestic box office (It did open on the same day as Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) to end the year, the 88th highest grossing movie of 2016."
" Not Great, But Doesn't Deserve The Maltreatment It's Been Getting
",2017-12-18 00:00:00,6,"Over the years, Will Smith has shown to be a well-rounded performer. It's just a crime shame that ""Collateral Beauty"" has been plagued with negative slack from the critics, complaining for reasons that are so unnecessary it's almost laughable. Granted he has been in his share of comedies, action, science-fiction and summer blockbuster films, but what his best dramatic performance before ""Collateral Beauty""? My guess would be ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"". It's probably ages since the critics have been on the rampage to arbitrarily take apart a worthy film and badly ostracize it in every way possible. It's a shame this movie was the metaphoric punching bag. Though I can't really regard it as a classic, it still has many qualities that standout quite remarkably. For starters, Will Smith can still stand toe to toe with any performer regardless of all the awards and accolades his other co-stars have received over the years. Think of the performers that are in this movie. You have Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Keira Knightly and Helen Mirren are all two-time Oscar winners and it's a shame that Michael Pena has been overlooked of getting one. Smith is the guy that truly sands out above the flock even though his character is most of the time wordless. Another trait that makes this movie enjoyable is when it targets at the cliches, even when it abides by other cliches. At least it targeted the cliches that have annoyed me the most over the years. I won't delve into the arcs of the characters, but once you see the move you'll see which cliches are being targeted. In one of the more surprising elements that makes this movie work was that very little spoilers were seen in the trailers, especially by placing the best scenes in the trailers and all the less interesting scenes out which I hate. I want to see a film where even good scenes are left out of the trailers not be hoodwinked and have my intelligence insulted. As I've said before there are still plenty of traits that make this film far from perfect. In his time of grievance over the loss of his young daughter, Smith's friends seem to treat him pretty shabby and now they are yearning for the viewer's redemption. I don't think so! The film easily persuades us we should go into that process and think everything they said can be forgiven. However, the swerve in Smith's character was too rushed making it feel quite unnatural and the twist was just way too ironic to be solved.  The transformations to change in the other characters from unlikable to more sympathetic seem to happen so soon and too sudden. Thematically it went with the story and it made perfect sense, it was very rough in its delivery which wasn't fully satisfying. Others might agree or disagree it's their opinions and they're entitles to it. When the smoke clears, ""Collateral Beauty"" is a a great film with did not deserve the negative backlash it got from the critics. It delivered the way it was intended and in a rare instance it had me in tears. Sure it overlooks the subject of death and grief, but it stays true to its intentions and is meat to tug at your emotions. And that is not entirely a bad thing."
" A beautiful gift called Life
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,7,It's a beautiful movie.it tells sometimes an unfortunate incident may happen to you but you don't stop living.you cannot cheat death.you will find love everywhere and time is a beautiful gift which you waste when you brood over past.live every moment of your life because it's not coming back. Will Smith has really done a good acting so as others.you can feel his pain.movie says you are not the only one who is fighting in his/her life but everyone is.So stop cribbing about it and let's enjoy every moment.
" Just superb and I don't normally do tears?
",2017-11-30 00:00:00,10,"Did not know what to expect, however this is Will Smith in a movie with an absolutely superb cast; Mirren,Knightley,Winslet,Norton,Pena, Harris, Expectation ensues, which delivered beyond expectation. The subject matter of losing a child is so so hard and we should berate all those reviewing a*rseholes that don't even respect the content. The realiasation moment was superb and when I blubbered like any normal person should into a hankie. 10 out of 10 for me."
" A movie made so well that critics couldn't fathom the really depth of it.
",2017-11-27 00:00:00,10,"In the first 20 minutes the entire plot is revealed and so most of the critics lost there mind and wrote how bad the movie is, just based on the first 20 minutes.The beauty of this movie begins after 20 minutes, when all characters come together. The journey is extremely well until the end.This movie is really good, and it is one of those movies that critics can bash all they want but it will touch you, make you feel happy and even bring tears to your eyes. Don't believe the critics review on this one.. Just look at the viewer reviews and how much people like me have loved it."
" Collateral Beauty is a Beauty!
",2017-11-23 00:00:00,10,"I waited for quite a while until watching this film. That is because I had heard we were given a trailer that fed us something not even remotely close to what the film represents. Please do not read below this if you do not want SPOILERS.SPOILERS:First of all, yes, the actors (Love, time and death) were hired by Norton, Winslet and Pena to stalk Will Smith's character ""Howard"". Or at least they think they were the ones initiating the deal.One by one the ""actors"" would convince Howard somehow that he was either crazy, or as an audience, we are hoping he snaps out of his emotional downward spiral due to the death of his daughter. After seeing the movie and being able to legitimately dissect it, we know that Knightly was sent as LOVE to catch Norton's eye. She purposely wears a red knit cap noticed by Norton as he chases her down and follows her to the theatre. Love reels in the first catch and the other two followed.As TIME collects his check from Winslet at the end, he proceeds to tell her that the play is no longer going to happen. Coincidence? Not really, since they never intended to have one.Then we later find out that Mirren was DEATH in the waiting room at the hospital with Howard's wife. This automatically tells us that these three entities who were hired as actors are really the spirits we've been told they were as shown in the trailers. At the very end, Howard turns around and sees the three on the bridge, but they disappear when his wife turns around.I am very satisfied with the entire film. If you did not realize at the end that the three are spirits, you did not catch the clues and maybe this just isn't the film for you."
" Mellow, vapid , silly
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,4,"This film was hard to watch until the end without facepalming at least seven times. Collateral Beauty is one of the dullest dramas ever, not even successful in his tearjerking mission. Sad moments are way too forced, and the whole story is insanely stupid. Stay away from this"
" I loved it
",2017-11-16 00:00:00,10,"I just watched this movie and it shook me to the core. I haven't lost someone, but how this movie tell this story is just blowing me away.Please, whatever you do; Don't listen to the so called ""professional"" critics. Just watch this movie and make your own opinion. I was skeptical after seeing the other reviews, but I'm very glad I didn't listen to them!This is a beautifully told story with excellent screen play, great acting and a very deep tone. I'm a 27 year old man who rarely cry when I see a movie, but this night I just couldn't stop crying. The ending was a huge surprise, a very welcome surprise indeed.The ending sound track with ""One Republic - Let's Hurt Tonight"" was a strong choice that fit the movie perfectly (listen to those lyrics). Just see it. It may change your perception of life."
" Doesn't live up to the hype
",2017-11-15 00:00:00,2,"Collateral Beauty seemed to have some hype and fans going for the film leading up to its release due to its case, though once the first trailers came out, there were a bit of skeptical considering they came across as forced and clear ""Oscar bait"". Some of trailers led to believe the film was different, though from the actual film, it isn't as good and comes across as forced and cheesy. A lot of the film tried too hard at being emotional, depressing and intelligent but in actually it is quite silly, over the top and not that engaging. It is quite bizarre and the panning from the critics (13% on Rottentomatoes, 23 on Metacritic) is accurate. However, this appears to be one of those films where casual movie goers like the film much more than the critics (6.8 IMDb, 64% audience score on RT, 6.2 on MT).Collateral Beauty has decent acting for the film but the general plot is quite silly. Will Smith suffers a tragedy that he lost his daughter 2 years ago, where we see he isn't mentally himself and is depressed, so his colleagues decide it would he right in playing a sort of prank on him, in order of getting him to feel better as well as documenting his behavior and showing it to the higher ups so he would not be able to vote for their certain procedure. The film has some okay moments but in general it is quite boring and the side characters are there for filler. Ed Norton's character's subplot with his daughter felt forced, as well as Michael Pena suffering from a sort of illness. We simply did not care too much for them. Overall Collateral Beauty is a massive disappointment, both in box office success and overall quality."
" Excellent!
",2017-11-03 00:00:00,10,"The story, the acting, the directing - all spot on. Some of the surprises I got only moments before the reveal. (It's hard to get one by the ol' Jazz.) I just don't understand the naysayers. OK, some of you bailed before the story unfolded - uh, it's call plot development.It's been quite a while since I've seen a movie so well done.Please, just watch it."
" Another happy reviewer who didn't listen to the critiques
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,10,"Yes, I'm another happy reviewer who didn't listen to the critiques about this movie or the rate. This is another magnificent piece of art by Will Smith, and nothing short from Excellent! The whole scenario is beautifully portrayed about some of the most complex issues of life, and delivers very strong and touching messages. The performance of the full crew is great, and Smith is PHENOMENAL!!! High recommended if you enjoy fine pieces of art!"
" left me cold
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,4,"Howard Inlet (Will Smith) has been a zombie since losing his daughter two years earlier. He spends all of his time putting up domino chains and knocking them down. His business partners Whit (Edward Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet), and Simon (Michael Peña) are concerned. They would like to sell the company but Howard owns 60%. Whit is divorced struggling to connect with his daughter. They recover a letter he wrote to Love, Time, and Death. Whit is taken with Amy (Keira Knightley) and follows her to her acting group. The partners come up with an idea for Amy and two of her acting friends Brigitte (Helen Mirren) and Raffi (Jacob Latimore) to portray Love, Time, and Death to 'gaslight' Howard.Will Smith is doing a depressed low energy guy. The three partners' motives are questionable at best. The three actors are acting obsessed and callous. I can't attach to anybody. It all leaves me cold and then there is a final twist reveal. The twist only accentuates how fake and artificial the story had been. It is all contrived and manufactured emotions. The only way to truly do this is to follow Howard's point of view. At least, that has a chance for the audience to empathize with him. The audience can discover the hiring of the three actors along with Howard. The twist reveal could be truly shocking and the movie can even do a double twist if it wishes. Despite the stellar cast, this is a sad, tiresome watch."
" Pure magic
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,10,"This film is pure magic without any use of cgi effects or cartoon simulation. It comes from that source of magic which is our need to believe in something. Maybe all religions came about when we had to face the deaths of our loved ones. Maybe the consolation we need, and which they strive to provide, is what makes for that harmonious whole of congregation, text and spiritual leader. In the Jewish faith there is the recitation of the Kaddish which sternly redirects our grief to praise of that which created this universe. This film does not come short of that, but takes a meandering (yet tightly-plotted) course of discovery unique to a man who has been broken like Job, whose faith in every last thing has been denuded as false. Leonard Cohen recently said not one of us is not being tested, not one of us is immune to suffering and loss. He was rephrasing what it says time and again in the Bible and elsewhere, wherever we look for comfort.It is amazing Hollywood assembled such a stellar cast not as a box-office draw but to exploit each actor to the best of his abilities. Helen Mirren shines, Kate Winslet, Ed Norton, Michael Pena draw every laugh and tear out of you, while Will Smith's performance is exalting.There is much to quietly reflect on in this movie, hours, days, weeks, months, years later....It occurs to me that, if you have not been deeply affected by the death of someone, this movie will be utterly lost on you. I read the negative reviews and they savage the heart of this film like wild beasts, each trying to out-do the other with witty, cutting remarks. They read as a team effort to beat up a weakling, not knowing they will one day find out they were related to him."
" Will Smith gave his all - but it wasn't enough.
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,4,"The plot was too self consciously clever though the guest stars were terrific. But the lynch pin - Will Smith - does not deliver. He gave his all, but it wasn't enough to make the viewers believe and feel his pains. So the whole film felt synthetic. In contrast, consider 'Demolition.' That film also has a other worldly quality, but it works more subtly and charms the viewers into following its protagonist's journey."
" An Amazing Film
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,10,"The story is deep. The acting is amazing. There are so many great moments. And if I watch it again, I may cry. Will Smith shows what it is like to lose a child, and how his life has ground to a halt. He lives every day, but he cannot move forward. Until his friends decide to try to prove that he is too upset with life to be allowed to continue to run his ad agency into the ground. Their brilliant idea is to hire three actors to portray Love, Time and Death, because he has been writing letters to those cosmic concepts as if they are persons. Their intention is to capture video of him arguing with those entities to show that he is out of his mind. But he, along with his friends, gets help from those entities. Excellent writing, great scenes, I just finished watching it, and I have to go now. All I can say is Goodbye!"
" The Afterlife
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,6,"Howard Inlet (Will Smith) is a mere shell of his former self after the loss of his young daughter. He spends his time at work building elaborate Lego schemes and writing letters to the great beyond on topics of Love Death, and Time. He seems to be slipping further and further away each day.In desperation, his co-worker friends hire actors to play the parts of Love, Death and Time hoping to shock him back into reality. Claire (Kate Winslet) thinks it's a bad idea, but goes along with it. Are there people that are sent to help us transition or let go of the living? This film skirts some of those thoughts. What happens in the beginning will be explained in the end, both in this film and in life."
" Just another bad film
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,1,The movie is slow moving with a poor plot. Will Smith struggles to fit the character of a battled father. His character is not convincing. What a waste of time and money to make this film. Another flop movie for Will Smith like I Robert and After Earth are all bad films. Will please go back to comedy.
" Love. Time. Death.
",2017-09-14 00:00:00,7,"I think I underestimated this flick. Despite a wonder cast, I judged the film before watching it. I was surprised how beautiful film it was. Though not a film of the year. It was like 'A Christmas Carol', except the past, present and future were replaced with different topics. And for each topic, separate set of characters with one twist at the end. The overall film was short and sweet.A successful businessman man who had lost his child seems not able to come out of the sorrow. His partners are worried for him, as well as the firm's future. So they come up with an idea to bring back their partner that they hire actors to help him recover. How the remaining tale turns out and the last part of the story brings an emotional ending.There were lots of actors for just an 90 minute film. But everybody had a fair share. Nobody was greater than others. Smith had less dialogues as his role demanded that. From all, Winslet role was so ordinary, comparing her star value. Knightley was good, but her one of the dialogues about 'love' was awesome. Norton, Pena and Mirren, all were good in their respective parts.An emotional film, but I don't think it appeals enough to everybody. As I'm being a fan of that theme, I felt it should have been a bit strong in those parts. Other than that it was a good film, a family friendly drama. It was not based on any book, though, looks like one. Surely worth a watch, especially if you love tearjerker films.7/10"
" One of the best movies of all time.
",2017-09-09 00:00:00,10,"This movie will bring you tears, just like it did to me. It's very emotional, and I love it. That's why it's one of my favorite movies of all time. It makes you live along the feelings that the main character felt. I think Will did a good job playing Howard. I also loved the twist at the ending, which made me cry. So if you're thinking of watching this beautiful movie, make sure you have some napkins by your side."
" A must see
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,10,"I am so mad at myself for listening to the bad reviews for this movie. I should have followed my own instincts and went to see it in the theatre. But thankfully HBO showed it and I loved it. I've seen it 4 times now. Being a bereaved parent myself, it hit me especially hard. I even bought the beautiful sound track. Please do not miss this movie it is so beautiful!"
" Critics need to get a life

And the soundtrack is gorgeous and rips your heart out. There is nothing negative to be said. The performances are splendid across the board."
" Incredible
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,10,This movie was incredible. It brought me to tears. I know dozens of dead people and I am only 31. The pain can be overwhelming at times.Those who talk sh!T about this movie have no idea what real loss is or are unable to understand the depth to which the movie takes it. Im a three time felon who has SEEN IT ALL and let me tell you there is a underlying truth in this movie that is profound. Live.
" Shame on the Critics-- they shouldn't be reviewing movies!
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,10,"I wanted to see this movie because it was a Christmas movie and it had an incredible cast. When a movie can make me laugh, cry and feel good, I feel as though it has done its job to entertain me. The movie theater was full and when the funny parts hit, the whole audience laughed and when the sad parts were there, the whole audience was sniffling, so I can't understand how this movie received bad reviews. I pay attention to people while leaving the theater and no one had a look on their face that this movie was horrible. All of the actors in this film were perfect. Kate Winslet,always gives her best performance,Ed Norton was kind,funny and heartfelt, Michael Pena,his chemistry with Helen Mirren was perfect and I felt for him, Helen Mirren got the most laughs,Keira Knightly was stunning and played love the best, and Will Smith..........This was an Oscar Winning Performance as far as I am concerned. You gave your all and people noticed it. I am sorry for you all the critics, for what-ever reason gave this terrible scores. It is very sad because I believe more people would have went to go see it at the movies if they would have given you better reviews.The Critics must be too young, or too old or just into gory,gross, over sexual and really nonsense films because I can't see any reason that this movie was not rated higher at least an 8. I am giving it 10 because I love it and understand loss. Kudos to the cast and to you Will Smith! Bravo!!!!!"
" I do not understand the utter bad reviews for this movie
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,7,"This movie is about a parent (Will Smith) coping with the grief of losing a 6 yr old child. This was in no way as bad as the critics cried out to be. Howard (will smith) used to be an advertising genius and entrepreneur before he became devastated with the loss of his daughter. Being the majority shareholder of his firm he became a ship which was pulling everyone to the bottom as it sank. So when his partners were unable to bring him back over a period of 2yrs they ""gaslight"" him. Howard in his own grief was completely detached with the world outside. His partners and employees were at the brink of joblessness and financial ruin. Whit (Edward Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet) and Simon (Michael Peña) are his long time partners and friends. They employ a PI to monitor his actions so that they could render him mentally unsound and thus incapable of using his majority shareholder voting rights in the decision to sell the business to another firm. In the meantime Whit whose mother is slightly mentally unsound has an idea to employ actors impersonating Love time and death , the 3 abstracts that Howard is obsessed with. HOWARD had written poignant letters to all 3 abstracts which the PI had acquired.it was an attempt to step into Howards reality and help him recuperate or else use the evidence against him. The letters written by Howard were soul wrenching. This was a father whose career and marriage fell apart because he didn't know how to deal with his grief. The story shows different ways to cope like going to group therapy sessions. It also shows that there is a difference between how each parent of the same child copes and perceives the situation. There are sub plots revolving Whit,Claire and Simon too who think they have chosen actors but actually the 3 abstracts chose them one each to show what they were each missing out.Helen Mirren as Death couldn't be more firm in her consolations or more sassy in her attitude reflecting the inevitability and finality that she represents. Its also ironical that death which should be the end of all pains is a woman as opposed to all cultures showing Death as a formidable man. Keira Knightley as Love was the cutest and smartest form Love could come in. She looks fuller,says clever and funny lines and yet reflects compassion and pain in her eyes just as love should be. Jacob Latimore as time is curt and impatient. He is smart and speaks in mysterious ways contradicting himself at times, rebukes and mocks Howard and Claire on how we waste its gifts. I liked the movie. It touched my heart although the plot could have been smarter. May be more depth and credibility could have been lent to the sub plots. Kate winslet was good but was wasted in a somewhat soppy character. I resented that. Edward Norton as Whit who was recently divorced due to his philandering, stayed with his sick mom and at the brink of financial ruin was aptly portrayed. He is the suave Newyorker who takes advices from uber driver (Try to step in their reality rather than force our own on them.Would love to take therapy from such an uber driver).Micheal Peña as Simon who way dying due to cancer, was mostly coughing through the movie which was slightly cliché. These are some holes i found but not worth panning the movie altogether."
" Great storyline but an average execution by the director. 5/10
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,5,"Collateral Beauty (2016)Plot: When successful New York ad executive Howard Inlet (Will Smith) suffers a personal tragedy and retreats from life, his friends devise a drastic plan to reach him before he loses everything. Featuring an all-star cast this thought-provoking drama explores how even the deepest loss can reveal moments of beauty, and how the constants of love, time and death interlock in a life fully lived.Review: This movie was cleverly written, and I did find the storyline intriguing at the beginning but after a while, I found it quite boring. The top cast, all put in an emotional performance but the director should have played on the death, time and love concept a bit more. Anyway, Will Smith plays a high flying business man, Howard, whose in partnership with Whit (Edward Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet) and Simon (Michael Pena). After sadly losing his daughter, he puts his company in jeopardy, by not signing important documents which desperately need to be dealt with. All of his partners try to communicate with Howard but he's in a world of his own, and he finds it hard to interact with anyone. After writing touching letters to death, love and time, Whit hires actors to play the 3 elements, to try and get into Howard's mind, and make him face his problems. After a while, it turns out that all of the various characters have there own issues, which they eventually come to terms with during Howard's breakdown. I think the main problem with the film is the slow pace, and the direction that the movie takes. It really does show how different people deal with lose and personal issues but from an entertainment point of view, it seemed to hit a brick wall after a while. With that aside, the cast and the concept kept it interesting throughout but I was expecting more towards the end. Basically, it's not the type of film that you will watch twice, and I personally think that it was a waste of a brilliant cast but it's still a watchable movie, with an original storyline. Watchable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by David Frankel, 58, who also brought you Miami Rhapsody, The Devil Wears Prada, Marley & Me, The Big Year, Hope Springs and One Chance. He certainly has quite a successful career to date, which is why he was able to pull together such a big cast for this movie. Personally I've been disappointed with Will Smith's latest movies, like Concussion, Focus, After Earth and A New York Winter's Tale, and I can't see his latest project, Aladdin, directed by Guy Ritchie, pulling him out of this bad track of movies. On the plus side, he is supposed to be starring in a new Bad Boys movie, which should bring his humorous side to light. As for this movie, the whole cast and crew want it to be taken as a fable, which has a mixture of comedy & drama but I think that they didn't do the writer any justice, who put together a brilliant story, which could have been executed much better from the director. Budget: $36million Worldwide Gross: $88.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/romance movie, starring Will Smith, Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Michael Pena, Helen Mirren, Naomie Harris, Keira Knightley and Jacob Latimore. 5/10"
" Difficult subject, not a bad effort. Tear jerker, but meant to be.
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,7,"I can't believe how vicious the professional critics were to this. If a film maker takes on an exceedingly difficult subject he shouldn't be torn to shreds even if it's a miss. There was a lot of talent on this movie, good performances, a pretty fair script, nicely shot, a twist or two. People lose their very young children sometimes and it's awful, arguably the worst possible thing that can happen to anyone. I don't know how you might delve into that real life devastation, but at least these people tried."
" 'Death is so much more vital than Time. Death gives Time all of its value.'
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,10,"Letters to Love, Time, and Death – that is the simple message that opens this illuminating and insightful and philosophically rewarding film as written with consummate skill by Allan Loeb and directed with respect and taste by David Frankel. It is an investigation of life, love, death, grief, and recovery – a film that will most assuredly bring solace to those who have lost close loved ones while preparing all of us to look at the process of life and death in a more resonant manner.When successful New York advertising executive Howard (Will Smith) suffers a great tragedy (the death of his 6 year old daughter), he retreats from life. While his concerned friends and co-workers Whit (Edward Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet), and Simon (Michael Peña) try desperately to reconnect with him, he seeks answers from the universe by writing letters to Love, Time and Death. Engaging an investigator (Ann Dowd) to watch Howard, his friends and co-workers discover a troop of actors – Helen Mirren, Keira Knightly and Jacob Latimore – to impersonate Death, Love, and Life. Howard begins to open, attends meetings with other victims of loss (including the radiant Naomie Harris), but it's not until his notes bring unexpected personal responses that he begins to understand how these constants interlock in a life fully lived, and how even the deepest loss can reveal moments of meaning and beauty.The acting is extraordinarily fine from the entire cast, the musical score by Theodore Shapiro enhances and never detracts from the mood of the film, and the cinematography by Maryse Alberti is sensitive. Highly recommended on every level."
" Don't be afraid to like it
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,8,"It is OK to see and like Collateral Beauty no matter what the critics say. It isn't a happy movie but it ends happily. It isn't a movie rich in scenery or special effects, no romantic side story or even much complexity, no snappy soundtrack. In many ways, it is about life's challenges and how people each struggle with their own in their own ways. It is a simple movie with a lot of things to think about. I felt for the characters no matter what their individual struggle was. I wanted each of them to find peace and resolution to some very real, life changing situations. And, at the end of the movie, I was glad that I had seen it. I will likely see it a few more times. There is more to this movie than the professional critics would ever see. Its OK to like this movie."
" wonderful examination of morality, hope, chance, benign ultimate truths, and BLACK BELLY LAUGHS
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,10,If just for the moments when Winslet and the guy from the Redford film are rationalizing destroying this wonderful man's fragile hold on hope after tragedy.Then the blah blah kicks and after that it is just blah blah blah until Will as the magic negro gets the tear machine going again.
" A movie that gives hope to those who have lost love, yearn for death, and waste time.
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,8,"Will Smith's character, a businessman who searches for answers to the loss of his child, does a great job showing the difference of a happy man (although brief) and then a sad and beaten man trying to keep existing.Such a lighthearted movie intertwined with sadness and hope. Also a well casted movie. I feel like I could watch the movie many times and get something different from it every time. Each entity brought such passion to the roles. As the main character is so angry at Death, Love and Time, the same entities show the same passion, and anger back at times. As we see Death, Love and Time interact with the different characters I am reminded of Dickens A Christmas Carol. It does not end quite the same as this movie has a different and some what confusing twist. Which brings me to my only fault...did Will Smith character forget his wife completely? Did I miss something explaining how he did forget her? A wonderful movie with great complex thoughts that bring such powerful feelings and hopefulness. May end up a cult classic one day...maybe."
" I'm gifting you
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,10,"Howard (Will Smith) owns 60% of an ad agency. When his daughter dies, Howard goes off the deep end for years causing the agency to lose accounts. With the agency is about to fail, a generous buyout is on the table. However, Howard won't discuss the matter. Three employees develop a plan of competency for Howard, while at the same time give him shock therapy by having actors visit Howard as Death (Helen Mirren), Time (Jacob Latimore) and Love (Keira Knightley) like the ghosts that visited Scrooge. What makes the film clever is that each of the three employees have serious issues themselves with death, time, and love.The film deals with the grief of a lost child so it is guaranteed to be a tear-jerker. I had initially thought the film should be 4 stars until I watched the double twists or surprises at the end which I admit I thought were clever and changed the whole complexion of the film. Heart warming clever drama.Guide: No sex or nudity. I did hear Time utter a quick F-word"
" everyone needs to make a connection
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,6,"I understand that the critics panned David Frankel's ""Collateral Beauty"". I didn't find it to be a great movie, but I didn't think that it was a bad one. I guess that the point that it was making is that social isolation can't be a lifestyle, even for an executive. Will Smith plays a role quite different from the ones with which we usually associate him (he probably wanted to show that he can be more than just the cool dude in action flicks).I found the characters played by Helen Mirren, Kate Winslet and Keira Knightley to be the most interesting ones in the movie. Naomie Harris played a good role here, but her performance wasn't as strong as in ""Moonlight"". Overall, I'd say that the cast did its best with the material that it got given.Basically, it's an OK movie. Not one that I'd recommend over anything else, though.PS: David Frankel also did ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and ""The Big Year""."
" Nice, uplifting film

Actually I'm glad that I didn't see this with a crowd. It was an intimate, thoughtful movie with great actors and performances. I believe that this is one of those films that will ""grow"" on people and will one day be seen as a classic. I specifically enjoyed Will Smith's performance, as well as Helen Mirren."

The first 20 minutes or so of the film was very disorientating, leaving me in a bit of a jizzle jazzle. As the film progressed and became more clear, I was really definitely, immersed deeply. The films concluding stage's were very mind bottling as it left me in a depressed state and i started to overthink my whole life, as it is not that much different from Howard's... (apart from the fact that his daughter is dieded and that he black.)"
" Very emotional, but the ending could've been better
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,8,"Totally figured out the ending, but didn't expect they'll bring it out on a very obvious tone. I mean, they could've let the audience decide whether time, love, and death were real. C'mon man.But it was good, heartfelt movie.PS. Helen Mirren was spectacular as always!"
" A touching film with a great twist.
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,9,"I really enjoyed this film. Although slowly paced, it managed to set the desired tone perfectly. These all star actors were perfectly cast. The directing and writing were top notch, as was the cinematography and editing. It's a dark heart-wrenching story that is touching but closes out with a pleasant plot twist. Sure, maybe it was predictable, but it was also executed very well. It's a 9/10 from me!"
" A beautiful heartfelt tear producer
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,10,"Wonderfully written, in fact the writer must have experienced a loss that affected him profoundly, beautifully directed, the direction elicited the emotions I imagine the writer hoped to elicit, and superbly acted by all involved. What a gem, my wife and I were moved to tears. This is what a movie should be, it elevates rather than diminishes humankind! Good job one and all and thank you for this heartfelt, enjoyable escape. I was entranced throughout, completely engaged in this lovely story of loss, coming to terms with the loss, and ultimately surviving and moving on. The pace of the movie is perfect, it's story is revealed virtually every screen second never leaving the viewer wanting."
" An average drama
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,7,"A charismatic person, full of life and joy suffers deeply after the loss of his six year old daughter. He retires into his own thoughts, living alone, while his agency for which he worked so hard with three friends gets on the verge of bankruptcy. Seeing the situation become desperate, the three seek out to enter his disturbed world, hoping to save him or prove that he's mentally ill, both ways saving the agency and earning a lot of money.It's a movie which presents the drama of a man who entered a state of depression after the loss of his beloved daughter. It presents how he copes with the situation, what he does in order to rectify something and what he receives from outside, while preparing an unexpected ending. Unfortunately, the movie is very slow paced and dull, most of the actions leaving the impression that they lead nowhere. The three friends have a good and interesting idea in terms of entering his world, but their characters are not well developed and simplistic. Furthermore, you don't feel any pity for their situation, making you even think of them as some kind of bad people, looking only for their personal well being.What I did like about this movie was Will's performance which made his complex character credible, thus making you care about his faith. The plot twist in the end also is a white ball for this film, which proved to be quite average overall. The focus was put on the friends' attempt to save the agency but their characters and ultimately their actions proved to be a letdown from my point of view."

This film was written perfectly with enough drama and some romance even an action film fan would enjoy. As always, Will Smith was excellent in this film. Because of the phenomenal talent he has he plays these kinds of dramatic rolls perfectly. As I mentioned before, this film was written perfectly. The drama, the romance, and a plot twist, all which is done skillfully without going over the top. It will take you on a journey about life and what all can come with it and what you can learn through experiences in it, rather they are good or bad. See if for yourself."
" Beautiful Film, Critics couldn't be more wrong
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,10,"It's a shame that the critics, which were overly philosophically negative and I feel, misguided in their criticism, seemed to downplay the hard work put into this film and seemed to diminish audiences anticipation for seeing this film. I have to admit after reading the negativity myself I wasn't expecting to like this movie because how could so many critics be wrong? But after watching this film myself I realized the audience score, which averages over three times higher than the critic score for Collateral Beauty is the one to listen too. The film is crafted in a beautiful way that really shows a untypical approach to the subject matter. It is an important film for people to see regardless if you are a fan of dramas. The film speaks in great reflection about human connection, grief and trauma; all topics that we sometimes avoid to our detriment. Do not allow the negativity of the critics to withhold you from an untypical but great film. Allow yourself to form your own opinion on it, and give the film a watch for yourself. I'm sure you will be all the better for it..."
" sappy for the sake of being sappy
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,1,"I actually had high hopes for this movie. Great cast. Interesting plot. It starts off well enough and then halfway through the movie it just stopped going anywhere significant. This movie missed on every mark, despite good performances by nearly all involved. This was simply a script too sappy for its own good. Instead of telling a good story, it seems like the main intent was to try to get a tear out of you.Smith's character has distinct interactions in which he neither grows nor changes in any noticeable way.There are twists for no other reason than to just have twists. Perhaps the writers thought they were being so clever, but the twists were just pointless and gag-worthy.And one scene in particular with Norton's character and his daughter was just so poorly done for no better reason than to just put a big happy bow on the situation for maximum sappiness.PASS"
" Well intentioned, but misses the mark
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,3,"This film is to its credit trying to do an awful lot of things, and it's got a nice objective of trying to be a modern Christmas fable.Ssdly though despite the best efforts of a seemingly endless list of big name actors, the film starts slowly, and is then playing catch up in terms of trying to regain the audience's attention after that.It's all a bit overly sentimental, it's all a bit slow, and for those reasons I didn't really get into this film, despite me really wanting to.I understand that the critics had a field day being negative about it, and that's a shame, because it's a well intentioned film."

" Disregards the tainted critics
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,9,"Our world is crazy, violent and the current politics in the US have thrown everything OFF kilter. This film, for me, was a breath of fresh air focusing on real feelings, real issues and it was supported by an absolutely stellar cast. I say, BRAVO! and ""think for yourself"" rather than listening to the critics and particularly Rotten Tomatoes. Thank you for a viewing experience which took me away from ceaseless, useless violence and dissent. This film is hard to watch but for honest, decent reasons, not because of made up violence in films or from subjecting myself to the evening news. Just watching the domino scenes made the price of admission worthwhile. When Will Smith ventures into films with actual, honest emotions he wins. I recommend renting ""7 Pounds,"" another Will Smith film."
" Will Smith's Performance Is Worth Watching
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,6,"When ""Collateral Beauty"" hit theaters last Christmas it pretty much got lost in the box office shuffle. ""Hidden Figures"" was still inspiring audiences and the one-two punch of Denzel and Viola made ""Fences"" another must see flick for the holidays. So when it finally hit video a few months ago, I almost forgot that I had missed it at the theaters. With such an all-star cast (Will Smith, Helen Mirren, Kate Winslet, Keira Knightley, Michael Pena, and Ed Norton) I was expecting a much stronger movie. The story is a solid one, it just didn't get the chance to fully evolve. Will Smith is the ultimate reason to see it. His heart-wrenching performance is the only thing that really grounds the film. The supporting cast (as talented as they are) never got the chance to fully explore their characters. It wasn't a bad movie, it just could have been so much more. I don't say this about too many movies, but ""Collateral Beauty"" needed about 30 more minutes to completely tell the story it was trying to tell."
" Hardly an ugly duckling, lacking in too many areas to be considered a beauty
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,5,"'Collateral Beauty' is one of those films that was critically derided, critical reception was not kind to it, but has garnered a more polarising reaction from people commenting on this site.Seeing 'Collateral Beauty' without any prejudice, despite having knowledge of its negative critical reception the cast is such a great one with plenty of talented names, to me it was nowhere near as bad as critics have made out. It is a hugely flawed film and many of the critics' criticisms are on point, but there are far worse films around and is not bad enough to be one of the year's worst, it is nowhere near either among the worst work of anybody in the cast (for example Will Smith has never done a worse film than 2013's 'After Earth'). There are some good points here, that can be recognised by me, but can people seriously start expressing their opinion without resorting to critic bashing, conspiracy theories or insulting anybody with a different opinion to theirs, it is getting incredibly annoying and has gotten way out of control in the past decade.The best thing about 'Collateral Beauty' is the cast. Will Smith is understated and stoic, but also charismatic and affecting. Helen Mirren seems to be really enjoying herself and provides a few fun quotes, while Kate Winslet, Michael Pena, Keira Knightley and Edward Norton make much of little. 'Collateral Beauty' is beautifully filmed, atmospherically lit and crisply edited, and the soundtrack is not too intrusive, nor is it too low-key to be non-descript.Some genuinely beautiful and touching moments too, though they don't come consistently and actually come too far and between.Unfortunately, 'Collateral Beauty' is hugely flawed. It is very muddled tonally, with what it was trying to be raising some question marks (basically a drama but it seemed to try and do other things too that didn't mesh), as a result of trying to do too much and not doing much with most of it. There are pacing issues here, due to some scenes going on for too long and a few of them being little more than filler the film does have a tendency to drag.It was very difficult to identity with the main character's plight properly, because the character is too mysterious to the extent that he is underdeveloped and one-note. Many of the other characters are also underwritten. The script is also unfocused and sees some horrendously stilted and forced dialogue with overdone emotional moments and jarring comedic touches. The ending leaves a sour taste in the mouth, it lays it on so thick with the platitudinous schmaltz that emotionally it feels manipulative, meanwhile the final twist is laughable.Overall, not as bad as it has been made out but hugely flawed and not a particularly good, let alone great, film. It does feel like this is going to be an unpopular review, like one going out on a limb, judging from the defensive and condescending tone of many of the positive reviews. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

But sadly this is exactly what even five of them need: a strong script. And while there are some okay moments here, I would not necessarily say that the screenplay is really on a level here where it is good enough to really make for a good, let alone great, movie. It is an ultimate sob story I would say because every character here has basically one factor that makes their life tragic for whatever reason. Be it terminal cancer, the impossibility to become a mother, a bad father-child relationship - you name it. And then there is of course the central character played by Smith who is fighting his inner demons here as the father of a deceased girl who has stopped being part of the outside world and just lives life for himself. So his friends, played by some of the actors I mentioned, try to find ideas how to help him. They know that Smith's character writers letters to recipients like death, time etc. so what is their idea? Have these phenomenons respond to him. This is maybe the worst component of the entire movie action-wise. Imagine you have a dear friend who is emotionally very unstable since losing a loved one. What do you do? You send a woman disguised as death to him and pretend nobody except him can see her. Honestly, I would have expected the poor guy to completely go insane, but the somewhat bizarre result of it all is that for whatever reason he goes to a group of parents who lost their children to talk about it. Doesn't make sense to be honest.Completely aside from the protagonist, these struggles for the supporting players emotion-wise felt rushed in and just for the sake of it, so that every audience member should be so deeply affected by at least one of the bunch, perhaps through personal experience. It's a bit on the cheap side I must say. And what was it with these characters disappearing on the bridge at the very end? Does it mean they never existed? Or was it just for the sake of effects? I have no idea, but it sure was a bit on the pretentious side. So overall, this was really a missed opportunity, but honestly can you be surprised? After all, here we have the writer from stuff like ""Just Go with It"" and some other fairly weak romantic comedies, so from that perspective one must perhaps say that the expectations were fulfilled with this 2016 movies. The title is also a bit on the pretentious side and the way it was included was in theory not bad, but the crucial scene at the very end mostly including Mirren's character was not half as effective as it could have been unfortunately with the decent build-up. Quite a pity and also there are more than just a few moments that felt random and unrealistic. So yeah, I would not say this film is a trainwreck like many do, but it is also nowhere near the level it could have been. Just another pretty forgettable 2016 movie and definitely a wasted opportunity looking at the cast. Pure Oscar bait for Smith too and maybe one or two supporting players that did not work out at all. I have to give it a thumbs-down. Not recommended."
" You'll find here more than you thought you could
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,9,"Pure Shakespearean themes of love, life, death and hope in this movie.Colossal corner stones of our existence. Inexhaustible themes for many and any kind of art. Purpose of life and immortality of soul.Is a beauty in tragedy ? Can be life after death of love ? Can time heal the wounds ? Is the grieving man insane or we all around him ?You can find those answers and much more in this movie if you look deep really deep inside yourself and ignore b**ls**t of lies, swagger, pretending and all other things we learn while growing up. Open your eyes and listen to your heart.And the final question.Were those 3 hired actors real or love, time and death really came to help this poor little fellow come back and believe in life again.I'll leave you with this open question.9/10"
" A Fine Film....Worth Your Time
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,8,"I watch almost every genre as there is always something that will unexpectedly surprise me. This film surprised me with it's interesting take on how to reach a person who's suffering massive grief. Well acted by the entire cast I can't single out any one actor for rebuke or accolades as they all were very appropriate to their roles and characters. I will say that Dame Helen Mirren was dead on as a stage actor in her role but what do you expect from Helen Mirren...she is always amazing. I was caught off guard at the end when you found out the true relationship with Howard and Madeline and I should have seen it coming but I was caught up in the movie and a story as it unfolded....as the audience should be in a well written, directed and acted film. I highly recommend this film but be prepared to shed a tear or two."
" Another top-rated Will Smith movie in the watch-list
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,9,"I am not sure how to explain the stark contrast between critic and user reviews for this film. All I know is, it is certainly very good from my viewpoint. It isn't even the storytelling, which is interesting, what with 4 arches throughout the film. Admittedly, some of the arches almost outshone the main one in some parts. The performance from the star-studded cast is (mostly) brilliant. Story development is a bit slow, and still it clocks in under 2 hours. Regardless, if you plan to watch this, an appropriate mood would be more important than the time you have. Another top-rated Will Smith movie in my IMDb history."
" Moving and life affirming
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,8,"I had low expectations going into this as it appeared to have all the makings of a saccharine, insulting Hollywood oversimplification of life's supreme challenges. I was wrong. You have to suspend belief a little but once you do, Will Smith's performance jumps up several notches to leave you deeply moved. Yes, there are some other performances of marginal note but Mr Smith is without question the star of this show. Portraying very raw and real emotions in a totally believable way, this is Smith's strongest performance for a long time. The film is not perfect but it is one I will remember for a long time. A that is what marks out a good movie for me."
" Well done. Heartfelt
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,7,"I try to watch all Oscar contenders each year. La La Land and Moonlight were awful, in my opinion. I'm not sure if this one was nominated, but it should have been.Will Smith's character suffers a loss at the beginning of the movie and he struggles with coping with that loss. His co-workers/friends try to get him back on track using unorthodox methods. That's all I will say about the plot.See it. It was really good."
" Only Casting, No Acting, No Story.
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,1,"Huge disappointment, after seeing so many heavyweight actors and actresses in the cast I thought the film will be an absolute delight. But alas all my hope was destroyed after watching the film. Casting is all there is to in this film, but there is no real story. Everyone is dying in the film or having a major crisis in life, everyone is crying all the time. Somehow the managed to gather all the saddest people on earth in one film. Even in scenes where there is no need for tear they put extra effort to make it emotional, Like writer made the final confrontation scene with Whit (Edward Norton) and his daughter unnecessarily touchy and teary while it was genuinely a upbeat scene then it would have been far better scene. I think it was the writer's mission to made an emotional film but by overdoing it he made a sad and pathetic film.As there are so many great people in the film writer tried to give everyone an important role no one had time to build her/his character so that character could have any impact on the viewers' mind. It is a classic case of 'Too many cooks spoil the broth'.Do not watch this film, it will only create a bad impression about your favorite actors and actresses.NOT RECOMMENDED."
" An emotional movie with fine performances throughout
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,7,"In this David Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada, Marley and Me) directed film written by Allan Loeb (The Switch, Just Go With It), Will Smith (Men In Black, I Am Legend) stars as Howard a bereaved father who's business colleagues Whit (Edward Norton: Fight Club, American History X), Claire (Kate Winslet: Titanic, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) and Simon (Michael Peña: The Martian, Ant-Man) decide to hire three actors to answer the letters he is writing to Love, Time and Death, what he feels are the three abstractions in life that have betrayed him. Stocks in their company are going down as Howard refuses to deal with his personal accounts and this is a last-ditch attempt to save their company by selling it at a loss by proving that Howard is mentally incapacitated.The actors they hire are Brigitte (Helen Mirren: The Queen, RED) as Death, Amy (Keira Knightley: Love Actually, Bend it like Beckham) as Love and Raffi (Jacob Latimore: The Maze Runner, Sleight) as Time and they interact with Howard, making him question everything including whether to attend a child bereavement support group run by Madeline (Naomie Harris: Skyfall, Moonlight).This is a beautiful movie which takes you through all the emotions associated with loss and grief. I had not expected much with the negative reviews, but this is a film that makes you question everything, just like you do when you lose someone you love. There are phenomenal performances throughout from all and yes this is not a blockbuster, or thrill ride, but this film packs a punch nonetheless. It will make you cry and there are some subtle twists made more significant by the excellent acting, spot-on emotional quotes and hilarious one liners, for example: ""I thought you couldn't afford therapy anymore."" ""I can't. It was my Uber driver."" ""Be sure to notice the collateral beauty. It is the profound connection to everything."" ""I am love. I am the fabric of life. I am the only 'why'... I was there in her laugh but I am also here now in your pain. Do not try to live without me.""Although not released in December, this film could easily become a classic Christmas movie of the future, for it takes place in the run up to Christmas and there are shades of 'It's a Wonderful Life' about it in that it teaches you life lessons on difficult subjects in a non-preaching way and it makes you cry....buckets. Don't forget the tissues."
" Manipulative, loss of time unless you need to see people crying around obvious twists..
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,3,"Emotional manipulation, tear targeting to say it gently sensation, ridiculous clichés, seriously whats wrong anymore, stop doing these things again and again.. Whats wrong with the world, I mean .. done that been there et cetera.. Just avoid doing it.. or not after all it is what it is"
" Absolutely wonderful.
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,10,"I loved the movie and would recommend if you haven't seen it to watch it. I'm not a poet so I'm not going to wow you with my movie review, but I will say that I have children and I watched it with my family and I couldn't imagine losing any of my children. So for me it hit home real hard and yes I did cry, so if you just left the gym with the fellas this isn't the movie you watch with them."
" Hollywood schmaltz done wrong
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,2,"His got some runs on the board when it comes to schmaltzy and sentimental dramas with the likes of The Pursuit of Happiness and to a lesser extent 7 Pounds, but continuing on with a worrying amount of recent misfires, Hollywood playmaker Will Smith finds himself a side character in David Frankel's misguided and trite Collateral Beauty.Trying all at once to be both a feel good holiday period event, a heartbreaking tale of grief, loss and of course love as well as an awkward comedy. Beauty is one of those tonally off films that very early on suggests an uneasiness with its material and despite Frankel showcasing form in the past with films like Marley and Me and The Devil Wears Prada, he along with a seriously underdeveloped A-list cast get lost in a dire story of Will Smith's depressed marketing bigwig, that never once threatens to capture our hearts.As Smith's Howard struggles to escape the black hole of depression after his young daughter passes away, his loving (more so money hungry) colleagues in the form of Edward Norton, Michael Pena and Kate Winslet recruit the help of a trio of actors played by Helen Mirren, Keira Knightly and Jacob Latimore to pretend to be Death, Love and Time to make Howard love life again and start making money for the company.It's a truly odd story, one that may've worked had it been handled by someone in the form of Michel Gondry or Spike Jonze but produced here with the oversaturated cheese that Hollywood is known to produce, Frankel's film feels fake, forced and forgettable as well as a curious waste of Smith's time and name brand recognition.Relegated to what feels like a bit player in a story that is supposed to be about him, Howard gives Smith one of his worst roles outside of After Earth and Winter's Tale as we're barely allowed time or insight into Howard's life or history of what made him such a stand-up guy in the first place.We get ample looks at Howard making domino courses, riding his bike angrily around New York City and eventually conversations he has with a token love interest in the form of Naomie Harris's grief counsellor Madeline (whose role feels completely thrown into an already overcrowded support cast) but Howard's fly-in-fly-out nature in the film supposedly about him makes us care very little for what his going through despite the fact we know we clearly should.Final Say – There's nothing wrong with a little Hollywood heart-string pulling but Collateral Beauty is a deserved critical and commercial flop. With a wasted cast, a rather cringe worthy story and an ending that will likely have you rolling your eyes; Frankel's film ends up being another sad chapter in Will Smith's recent career output.1 thrown skateboard out of 5"
" A good cast with a stupid story don't make a good movie
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,5,"After reading some reviews on here before watching Collateral Beauty I had some high expectations. I thought I was going to be in for a treat but at the end the movie is just disappointing. It only deserves a five because of the cast. That's the only thing that didn't fail in this movie. You have a bunch of real good actors, like Helen Mirren, Edward Norton, Will Smith, Kate Winslet and others but that's not a guarantee for a good movie. You need a good story and this one is just poorly written. Maybe if you are a parent that lost a child you might find some comfort in this movie but otherwise it's just not good enough. The whole writing to and meeting Death, Time and Love thing is just ridiculous. It's one of those American movies where you supposed to learn a life lesson. But I don't need life lessons, and certainly not about a subject like this one, so besides the excellent cast this movie is just not good enough."
" Collateral Heart and Soul
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,8,"Collateral Beauty starts out slowly, somewhat painfully and seemingly stupidly so you lose faith. But about a third of the way in it becomes quite wonderful, though it helps if you love death. Will Smith could be better, though he tries, has his charm and comes through in the end, but Keira Knightley delivers several fabulous riffs, one as love, Helen Mirren is self illumined as death and Kate Winslet, Edward Norton and Naomie Harris shine in their supporting roles. Allen Loeb's script is spotty but ends up being superbly written though in a subtle way that many might under appreciate. And Maryse Alberti beautifies New York and captures other luscious sets and facial expressions as few DPs have, no doubt with the help of Frankel's sometimes excellent direction. The music is great and, ultimately, the film is quite love-filled and fulfilling if you have the temperament and patience."
" I did cry through most of it
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,9,"It was better than I'd hoped for from watching the trailers. It was a character driven play that slowly unfolded. And I thought it was beautifully handled. I laughed at parts and cried through a lot of it. Everyone in this brought their A game. And there were definitely surprises throughout. I'll only watch it once, though."
" Forgettable and boring.
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,4,"Collateral Beauty is a drama film that could have been great with well-done characters and a strong meaning about grief and loss. For some reason, the script and the plot was cliché and predictable. Do not get me wrong, the film has a great cast talent and tries to become a different take on a Christmas carol. The plot follows Howard (Will Smith) a successful executive until his life is turned upside down when his daughter passed away. He became so enclosed and depressed that even his business partners worry for him and their stake with their company. Whit (Edward Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet), and Simon (Michael Pena) hired a private investigator to capture evidence that Howard is incapable of running the company and notices he is writing letters to love, time, and death. The trio tries to hire three stage actors to portray as Love, Time, and Death. So they can try to help Howard and is unstable mental condition. I love the cast they have in the film like Will Smith, Edward Norton, Keira Knightley, Michael Pena, Naomie Harris, Jacob Latimore, Helen Mirren, and Kate Winslet. They all did their best. The script tried to give each of these characters a bit of development. Like Whit going through a divorce and is trying to be there for his daughter. Simon struggling with an illness that he has not shared to his wife. The script was unbalance trying to fit in with these characters struggles making the direction feel incoherent. In the end, these characters are forgettable. It has its predictability's and cliché that the film is flawed. Even though, it is suppose to be meaningful and emotional with the state of loss and grief. Collateral Beauty surprisingly was not as good as I was expecting from a script that created forgettable characters, a direction that is boring and incoherent. I was expecting a lot more from this."
" Honest Thoughts on Collateral Beauty
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,1,"First of all, I want to point out that the review on this movie from this site is completely wrong. It comes no where near a 5, much less a 6 or 7. It's like watching a high school play where people are pretending to act. I was shocked to see Will Smith and Edward Norton in the same film to witness such a horrible script they had to follow. Someone wrote that this movie has heart and that's why it deserves a great review. Come on guys, doesn't most movies have heart? We should be rating this based on how well the script was, the acting and overall plot. In that regard, it completely sucked. It's not a movie you should sit down with family to watch unless you just wanted something to play to pass time. This is an honest review of this movie. Also, IMDb needs to start giving better reviews. I don't know how many people think their reviews are off these days."
" Critics claim it's utter crap. May I dispute this?
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,7,"""Love. Time. Death. Now these three abstractions connect every single human being on Earth. Everything that we covet, everything that we fear not having, everything that we ultimately end up buying is because at the end of the day we long for love, we wish we had more time, and we fear death.""I'm afraid ""Collateral Beauty"" is just another film pulled along by a spiral of negativity among critics. Sometimes it happens that a certain opinion is being introduced and others use it as a guideline. Slogans such as ""Atrocious cynical and tearful"", ""A tearjerker without value"" and ""Pretentiously hot air"" appeared on my screen to my surprise. Admittedly, it isn't as peerless as ""The pursuit of happiness"". But it's not such a commercial nonsense as ""Men in Black II"" or as annoying as ""After Earth"". Maybe Will Smith isn't the perfect actor for a melodrama and you associate him with a more action-packed and lighter genre. Yet he could convince me as the grieving owner of an advertising agency. Every time a sort of global crusade is being organized against a particular movie and I don't agree with the used arguments, I feel like throwing myself into the breach for it. The last time I felt this urge was with ""47 Ronin"".I admit, a film like ""Hold Me"" brings up more emotions when it's about dying and saying goodbye to someone dear. And content-wise there are plenty of elements so you could label it as a melodrama. But what was the ultimate message? Is the movie solely about suffering, sorrow and pain? Or was the message also about that glimmer of hope, overcoming personal demons and recognizing the real values that are important in a human life? Well, cynics will look at it in a disgusted way. And yes, I myself thought that the end reached a high ""Scrooge"" level. Three metaphors trying to steer the lives of four individuals in the right direction.Not only the life of Howard (Will Smith) needs a little bit of steering. The three co-owners Whit (Edward Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet) and Simon (Michael Pena) have to deal with their own demons. Each of them will get the help of a metaphor to dot the i's en cross the t's. Their joint project is Howard, who leads a comatose and aimlessly life since the death of his six year old daughter (she suffered from a rare form of cancer). The charismatic appearance in the beginning of the film contrasts sharply with the self-destructive person who rides his bike against traffic like a kamikaze blinded by rage. He doesn't care about what will happen with the company he founded. Since months, the only activity there is designing a structure of dominoes. And after several days of hard work, he breaks it down by pushing the first domino. Is this self-destruction in a symbolic way?The first step to join a support group for people trying to handle a loss, is an impossible step for Howard. The next thing Whit, Claire and Simon come up with is a plan to prove that Howard is of unsound mind and can't take any decision because it could harm the firm. That's when three amateur actors enter the picture. Brigitte (Helen Mirren), Amy (Keira Knightley) and Raffi (Jacob Latimore) will perform each as one of the three abstractions and confront Howard with his writings. That is, the letters he writes to the abstractions. In this way they try to provoke an aggressive or irrational reaction.Critics in The US panned the film mercilessly because of exaggerated dramatics and according to public opinion a disgusting preconceived plan of the other shareholders. Let me counter these arguments. Take any season of Grays Anatomy and you'll be drowning in a pool of artificial drama and sickening emotional nonsense (but this is probably due to my hatred for television series). And saying the plan of the co-owners is morally offensive, is a hypocritical statement. I'm sure in the US (and other major capitalist countries) strategies like this are being used on a daily basis, trampling other individuals without pity and pushing them aside strategically. And pointing at Will Smith while claiming he isn't capable to bear a serious film, is also jumping to conclusions. I can't stand Keira Knightley (a film with her in it, and my cozy couch is covered with marks of my fingernails). But that's no reason for me to proclaim the film is totally crap (""Begin Again"" is an example of that).""Collateral Beauty"" is a wonderful film about grief and the consequences when losing a loved one. Admittedly it was a bit predictable. The connection between Madeline (Naomie Harris) and Howard was quite clear upfront. And the end was a bit too magical. But ultimately, I felt the film struck a chord and left an impression on me. Will Smith didn't succeed in moving me to tears as in ""The pursuit of happiness"". And the crying part isn't his strongest talent as an actor. But I still have respect for the person who started as a rebellious, yo-yo-yo rapping teen from Bel-Air. So beware of the bashing and look at it with an open mind. More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"
" Excellent movie to readjust our thinking
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,9,"Loved this movie. The acting is true, the emotional distress is real, and the characters, both human and other-worldly, are believable. The writing leads the audience to question while still feel there is hope to situations that seem hopeless. Adjust your thinking in order to see the ""collateral beauty"" in our worldly experiences."
" This film shouldn't have bad reviews
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,9,"This film makes me feel a lot of emotions. Love, sadness, hope, happiness, nostalgia... All the actors did an amazing performance doing his own character with passion and dedication. The main character (Will Smith) is one of my favorites actors and this film isn't his exception. His performance makes a before and an after into the film that makes you are in the story. Before I saw the film, I believed that the film was going to be the Christmas's's topic but during the story I knew that it is all except a topic. The end was the most beautiful and unexpected part of the story. In conclusion, this film can't have any bad review because is an untypical film that has an amazing plot."

",2017-04-07 00:00:00,8,"As my wife says, I am a man who doesn't show much emotion. But there were few times that I had tears rolling down my cheek while watching this film. I didn't know what the plot was or who the cast was besides Will Smith and it turned out to be a really good watch. Every actor has done justice to his/her character. I don't think this is one of those movies where you come back learning something. Its one of those where you come back feeling more alive and appreciate what you have. I guess the negative reviews are by people who saw the trailers and went to this film expecting something else. I am quite shocked at the low ratings this movie has got. Guess sci-fi movies get more positive reviews than movies showing normal people and emotions!"

" Amazing
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,10,"This movie a beautiful film full of love, heartbreak, and loss. Some people may think this film tries to make death seem happy and like its a good thing but it definitely doesn't. Some people can't understand it, but the only way you can truly relate to it is if you have experienced a great loss yourself. The film is fantastic for those who haven't as well. It will have you in tears. It's such a beautiful film and I loved it. It's mostly adults who go see it but teens can enjoy it as well. I'm 13 (I was crying by the end and I NEVER cry) and it was beautiful, the way it's filmed, the actors and the dialogue. It's such an amazing film with a few twists and turns.

Therefore I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this movie, especially given the mediocre average rating it's received. I found it to be touching and clever, well-acted, well-paced, good cinematography and a clever plot. There are some twists and surprises, more or less predictable but that didn't reduce its appeal for me in the least."
" Fantastic movie- Collateral Beauty
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,10,"The cast that portrayed the message of this movie was fantastic. This was a happy, sad, edge of your seat, funny, fantastic, and spiritual movie. To have a cast that ultimately can carry out the message of this measure doesn't always happen but when it does, the movie has just gone from good to Fantastic. A movie is only as good as it's able to be related to, so ultimately not everyone will have the same viewpoint. I absolutely loved this movie, as I myself am working on creating a meaningful life, lived with much love, am seeking a higher purpose to what life actually is versus what it really is. If we take our time to love life everyday than ultimately we have lived beyond death, with no fear of death, and only love to make our world bigger and brighter. This film has the capacity to change the spirit of everyone who watches it, whether or not they are ready to face the change. Thank you to the entire cast, writers, and everyone behind the scenes for believing in love."
" therapeutic beautiful

I believe that anyone who has grieved or is grieving, may find something they didn't realize they were looking for before seeing this movie... and they will be among those who see the full value of my 10 score. For anyone who wants thought provoking ... honest, raw, gentle, beautiful movie - I recommend it. The actors did a beautiful job - they put their heart in this movie... it shows... it was believable... I love the unexpected twists and the ending left me smiling with insights which lingered way after the movie ended."

'We long for love, wish for more time, and fear death'.The opening scene of the film shows Will Smith speaking to the company. The film shows exactly how love, death and time appear in our lives when we need them most. Edward Norton speaks to his daughter and she rejects him, and then Love(Keira Knightley) in the very next scene appears to him. The 'actors' are not actors at all they are figments of each persons imagination. They never actually hired anyone. And its the reason why each person is separated by the lesson they need to learn the most, Edward Norton(Love), Micheal Pena(Death), Kate Winslet(Time), and Will Smith(Love,Death,Time). Its the same reason why Will Smiths wife sees death in the hospital when she's losing their child. Its the reason why he always is setting up dominoes in the movie, it shows how one touch leads to destruction, but we can choose to see the collateral beauty in the dominoes and how they fall with music. But he doesn't choose to see the beauty he starts the first domino and walks away refusing to see any of it. I strongly encourage anyone who didn't like this film, to watch it again from this perspective. Everything comes together."
" A good cinematic and story contrivance
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,5,"It's easy to see why so many people like this - and why so many don't.It pushes all the buttons to generate empathy and the feel good factor, but the plot feels contrived in many places.First of all, it starts as a tragi-drama and then morphs into a semi-comedy but the first part is too long and the audience is firmly entrenched in tragi mode and wonders what the hell is going on when it turns comedic.Will Smith is usually good value and plays a good part here although the character is a total a**ehole (I'm British!) and his sudden switch is not totally believable.There are a couple of interesting twists near the end (my other 'alf got them both, I only got one (but I got the first 'clue'), (my excuse being that the plot had lost its coherence by then) but they're designed more to astonish as a 'clever' device (ie. what a clever writer I am, says Allan Loeb) than necessary plot revelation. (Think Sixth Sense and you'll see what I mean.)Outstanding actress is Helen Mirren who lifts the entire movie with her presence. I'm also a great Edward Norton fan and he is superb here, too.So, should you see it? Without a doubt - Yes! But prepare to be manipulated if you're a thinker/analyser. If you can suspend all your logical faculties then switch them off and just get swept away by cinematic and story contrivance and believe you've had an uplifting experience."
" An excellent movie but it was too short
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,9,"this movie made me interested in seeing every single scene it was simply a beautiful attractive movie and it has great potentials i didn't want this movie to end i was looking at the timeline and i say to my self please don't end now because something i was waiting for the whole movie didn't show up , i was disappointed really in the end of the movie , it had a great ending but it could be better . and if they cared more about the ending i was going to rate this movie with 10 stars. but now ill just give it 9 . the acting was great i love will smith omg great actor , and after him comes Helen Mirren and Keira Knightley just seeing them make me happy and Naomie Harris is a really great actress and she is the perfect match for a great actor like will smith ."
" Absolutely astonishing!
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely astonishing! It's like new Will Smith's ""7 pounds""! All the actors were brilliant! Acting and the plot was amazing. The script has a lot of inspiration to catch and a lot of emotions, messages to pass away. No one who is a real human can end watching this movie without shedding a tear! It deserved an Oscar. And surely, ""Collateral Beauty"" won the hearts of the people, which is way better than Oscar.Thank you to all of You for this great movie and great interpretations!We are only humans, but empowered with great possibilities!"
" Great premise, disastrous fruition
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,4,"Add some Christmas clumsiness, the unsuitability to talk about a sensitive theme. Now, try to pump everything up with a very starry cast, which adds exactly nothing to the movie. This is the representation of Collateral Beauty. Great premises, disastrous fruition until you happen to watch the movie. The attempt to put sentiment on this movie is done in the most goofy way, resulting in an almost no feeling monster movie."
" Powerful and Touching
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,9,"Advertising CEO Howard (Will Smith) lost his daughter to cancer 2- yrs ago and cannot function in a business sense. His partners are concerned and want to sell as the company is losing accounts. They decide to hire actors who will act as Love, Time and Death as those are the entities Howard writes letters to. They hope one of the actors will get through to Howard. But unknown to his partners, Howard goes to Madeline's (Naomi Harris) therapy session where parents have lost a child. Howard knows he needs to set his head straight. Madeline tells Howard she lost a child to cancer and she was 6-yrs old and her name was Olivia. She asks Howard, more than once, what was the name of his daughter and Howard does not reply. This is very powerful and touching and you may need a box of Kleenex at times. The actors who portray Love: Amy (Keira Knightley); Time: Raffi (Jacob Latimore) and Death: and Brigitte (Helen Mirren) do their best to convince Howard to snap out of it and later a video will be shown of them conversing with Howard but they will be digitally removed from the video so it will look like Howard is talking to someone no one else can see. The video will be shown to potential buyers of the company to show that Howard is not capable of voting to keep the company. Howard's partners are: Edward Norton as Whit; Kate Winslet as Claire; and Michael Pena as Simon. A sort of comic relief concerns Whit and his estranged daughter Allison (Kylie Rogers) as she believes Whit's infidelity with her mother caused the divorce and she wants nothing to do with him. Later, acting upon advice from Howard, we see Whit taking charge and finally getting through to Allison. These scenes are pure gold. We see a major twist (No one saw coming, right?) later when Howard visits Madeline on Christmas Eve and this is where you will really need that box of Kleenex.There may be a question you may have regarding Brigitte and the question is this: Is she really Death? Hmmm..This is truly a story whereby all the actors deserve Oscars as it doesn't get any better than this. Kudos. (9/10)Violence: No. Sex; No. Nudity: No. Language: Only one F-bomb was heard."
" Could be better... but is not a complete disaster
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,8,"It could have been a great thing... come on... Helen, Keira, Kate, Edward, Will!!! All this talent had to mean something... but yet, I know that expectation is the path to destruction. So, I went to this movie with my heart wide open. No expecting too much, neither too less. Something in the middle. So, while I was watching it - and getting emotional, by the way - I realized that Howard (Smith) wasn't the one who need the help from Death, Love and Time. If was it, he would be the one to meet them. But this was not what happened. In fact Howard was grieving, but he was trying. The letters represented he fighting against his depression. A way to fix himself. However, even if they were apparently well, his friends were fighting against time, love and death but they were not looking for help. They were losing the battle against themselves. So Howard was just an excuse. He understood the three more important things in life, but to his friends those concepts were unknown. People watch this movie expecting great things, but the messages are simple. Love while time does not allow death to act. Beucase death makes no bargains, death makes no concessions and only love can be greater then both of them, because love is in time and in death, and in everything in between."
" Poignant and beautiful movie
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,10,"Thank goodness I went with my gut instinct and gave this movie a chance despite the poor critics reviews. I can't think of a movie starring Will Smith that I've regretted immersing myself in. A necessary see for anyone who has experienced tragedy through loss. I for one don't always watch a movie for that ""feel good"" feeling....I enjoy watching a movie that is both raw and brutally honest. This movie gave me that experience and allowed me to reach places in my soul that aren't easily reached. It can be uncomfortable yet comforting in an extraordinary way that only a great story line and excellent acting can drive home. Ignore the poor reviews and see this movie!!"
" Good enough
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,4,"I don't know about the reviews, but this movie wasn't that bad. Well, the performances were really good (especially from Will Smith and Helen Mirren, who were perfect!) and the main story was touching. However, there were some factors that led me to rate this one 4 stars out of 10. And they are mainly due to the story and the way it was presented. So, we have a CEO and founder of a company, who is in depression because he lost his daughter. His colleagues are worried that his actions and indifference towards life would ruin the company. So, in order to save it, but because of other reasons, more personal, they have to prove that he is mentally unfit to continue leading the company. To do that they hire three actors to play Death, Love and Time, after letters the man had sent to those three, blaming them for taking his daughter away. Okay, so the story was a bit confusing at the beginning, but it got better after things were cleared up. But then, the ending tangled things again, especially the final scene. So, because of that, 4 out of 10."
" Emotionally charged drama is beautifully acted, but its too manipulative to take seriously
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,4,"Recovering from his disastrous role in 'After Earth' in 2013, Will Smith attempts to rebuild his acting career in this emotionally stirring drama following his role in last year's biopic 'Concussion'. Stepping in the shoes of a father dealing with the devastating power of grief and depression, Smith stars along a roster of A-list actors who serve as the highlight of this film's marketing. Unfortunately, an awe-inspiring cast of Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, and Michael Pena can only do so much to save this movie from the overly manipulative slog it transpires to. And one of the main enemies that bars this melodrama from reaching the heights of Oscar material is not only the schmaltzy script but a twisted concept that director David Frankel misrepresents in the marketing. Unlike how this film is advertised, this film follows Howard Inlet (played by Will Smith), a successful New York advertising executive who sinks into extreme depression following the death of his six-year old daughter. He spends his days relinquishing his executive duties writing letters to abstract figures: Love, Time, and Death. Fearing for the progress of their company, his co-workers Whit (played by Edward Norton), Claire (played by Kate Winslet), and Simon (played by Michael Pena) respond to his predicament by hiring three actors Amy (played by Keira Knightly), Raffi (played by Jacob Latimer), and Brigitte (played by Helen Mirren) to meet up with Howard and portray human versions of Love, Time, and Death respectively. In the meantime, they hire someone to record him interacting with them and then use a software to digitally erase the actors to show the company that he is ""mentally unstable"" to run to company.....Seriously? It is clear within the first ten minutes that the film aims for little more than to tug at your heart strings. The idea of a parent losing his or her child to cancer is everyone parent's worst nightmare, and a deeply somber subject considering the emotional damage induces. The story showcases the extreme depression the lead character faces upon losing his daughter which establishes a deep emotional core of the story. The idea starts off on a fairly strong note. But when the supporting characters callous plan comes into action, that is when the story makes a hollow turn. Will Smith's character battling depression over a devastating loss and struggling to find the capacity to do his job, and his coworkers decide that the best solution is to hire actors to make an utter fool out of him -- something equivalent to a childish high school prank. From there on, the real drama comes not from his overwhelming depression but how morally despicable these characters are. It becomes one of those rare circumstances where a story's attempts at pulling at the heart strings borders on the line of unintentional laughter, if a little disgust for inhuman his coworkers are. Although the film generates a few good moments of genuine sentimentality such as his meetings with the support group hosted by Naomie Harris as well as well as some well-landed attempts at humor, the plot is a bit hard to take seriously for how unduly contrived the execution is. The ending, while somewhat of a tear-jerker, falls victim to a rather cheesy twist.For an ensemble cast flowing of A-list actors, solid performances can only be expected. Fortunately, the cast performances serve as the saving grace for the movie's deeply flawed rendering. Stepping into the lead role is Will Smith, Oscar-nominated actor who does a magnificent job at showing his dramatic muscle with his performance. Among the large cast, he is easily the biggest standout in terms of performance and emotional heft. Edward Norton gives an honest performance as a man who reveals to be going through a divorce and is struggling to maintain the affection of his daughter. The same can be said for Kate Winslet as Claire who's struggling conceive a child through artificial semenation due to her being too old, and Michael Pena as a married man who's battling cancer and trying to hide it from his family. These actors share a rather thin chemistry with the trio of actors (Helen Mirren, Jacob Latimer, and Keira Knightly) who serve as nothing more than one-dimensional representations of their life dilemmas. In the other words, the supporting cast proves themselves capable of pulling off good performances, although they only make up half of the equation of for how ham-fisted their characters are.Collateral Beauty is a contrived emotionally charged melodrama suffers from a shrewd execution, with only a plethora of riveting performances to keep it standing. Calling this movie is a flop may feel a little bit of an overstatement, but it is hard to deny how fundamentally miscalculated it is. Anyone with a heavy heart may understandably find themselves weeping buckets, but only if they can get past the primary flaws."
" Last 5 minutes
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,7,"Another solid movie signed by Will Smith. This actor has a special quality that only few in his level do. He knows how to choose the really good works between the rest and knows how to handle them in order to create something at least worth watching.To be honest, he is one of the very few actors, (Edwart Norton is also one of them) that when I see he is participating in a film I know is gonna be good.What I really enjoyed in this movie, is how everything changes in the end. This is normal in a thriller, but in a drama like this is the first time I saw it and liked it very much."
" Collateral Beauty Explores Deep Ideas and Boasts a Great Cast but They Are Undone by a Bad Central Premise and a Sappy Ending
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,4,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* At the start of the movie, we briefly meet Howard (Will Smith), Whit (Edward Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet) and Simon (Michael Pena) at a party to celebrate how well their advertising agency is doing. Although they are all essential parts of the agency, Howard is the charismatic leader of the bunch and he gets up to give an inspiring speech to the employees. He talks about the 3 abstractions that we all have in life: love, death and time and how they're the key to reaching people in advertising.We then flash to 3 years later and things have changed. Howard has unfortunately suffered the loss of his daughter to a rare form of cancer. He's obviously grief-stricken and he's a shell of his former self. He shows up to the office, he doesn't talk to anyone and spends his days building domino towers and knocking them down. The agency is losing clients hand-over-fist and Whit, Claire and Simon are panicking. They care about Howard but the agency is about to collapse and while they have a standing offer of a buyout from a competing firm, they can't get Howard to sign papers to authorize it. He has the controlling majority and his grief is preventing him from doing anything except writing letters to Death, Love and Time. In a desperate attempt to regain control of the company, they hire a group of actors: Brigitte (Helen Mirren), Raffi (Jacob Lattimore) and Amy (Keira Knightley) to impersonate these immeasurable concepts to prove that he's incompetent.I want to get what I liked about Collateral Beauty out of the way (there were things to like). This is a pretty impressive cast and they largely did what they could to elevate this film. The trailer for this movie is deceptive, Will Smith isn't actually the centre of this movie. Edward Norton, Michael Pena, Helen Mirren and Kate Winslet actually get the most screen time. Will Smith gets a lot of crap but he performed as well as he could with this character and the concept this movie is centred around. I found Michael Pena and Helen Mirren to be the most charming of the bunch. Naomie Harris, Keira Knightley, Kate Winslet, and Jacob Lattimore were all good with what they were given. I'd especially point out Harris who's always been really underrated and Lattimore who'd I'd never seen before. The only exception was Edward Norton who wasn't bad but he seemed to be coasting through this.The other aspect I liked was that there were a lot of good scenes where 2 of the characters were talking about the issues they were working through. The interactions were very honest and while the dialogue was a little spotty, with the cast they've assembled, you're watching some of the best in the world doing what they do best. So there were scenes in this movie that really stuck out and they were good enough to hold my interest through some of the problems I noticed with Collateral Beauty.The biggest problems I had with Collateral Beauty are spelled out in my title for this review. Much like another movie I saw fairly recently named Passengers, Collateral Beauty has a hard time getting around the central idea the plot is based on. I had a hard time at the end sympathizing with any of the characters. You feel for Will Smith because of his tragic loss but his life has devolved so far and his mindset is so broken to the point where he can't sign some papers to save his employees' jobs or keep his agency from collapsing? He deserves pity but with so much time passing, what needs to be done requires so little of him that I couldn't believe he wouldn't do it. You also can't side with his friends or the actors/actresses they hired because the bottom line is that they're tricking/railroading an emotionally/mentally broken man. If you actually consider they're actions, I could honestly see this pushing him that much closer to a possible suicide. You understand why they're doing this but they're actions as a group were playing with fire in a dangerous situation.The other thing with Collateral Beauty is that while the movie largely turned out to be okay, the ending twist ruined almost any bit of goodwill I had towards it. It was relatively believable, the way events unfold leave certain things in the plot unanswered. Admittedly, the ending does clear those things up. The movie walks a fine line between genuine emotion and eye-rolling sentimentality and the tower they build topples into corniness with that plot twist. To me it just came off as way too in-your-face and they overdid the drama completely.This movie could have had the best of intentions and I would believe it completely. It deals with heavy subject matter and I think the cast did as good of a job as they could have. This movie just didn't work and I largely fall on the side of the critics. If this turns out to be your thing (I could see it working for some people, I think it will reach people who have experienced deep and personal loss) that's fine but in the end I couldn't connect with this movie."
" A complex lyrical essay on grief psychosis
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,7,"Every now and then the movie commentariat gets it wrong. Bad movies earn bad reviews, but it is something else entirely when a movie that is not bad receives universal condemnation. Last year that honour went to Collateral Beauty (2016), the most misread movie of recent times. Ignoring the fact that its cast includes Will Smith, Helen Mirren, Kate Winslet and Keira Knightly, actors not known for lending their names to C-grade flops, the question must be put: why does this film get such a bum rap?Some of the problem starts with the label on the product. When we buy a ticket to a contemporary 'drama romance' our senses are tuned for the usual genre tropes and conventions that help us interpret a film. If Collateral Beauty was labelled 'magical realism' the outcome might have been worse despite the more accurate label. This genre offers an essentially realistic view of life but it incorporates elements of magic, fantasy or the supernatural. Unprepared, viewers can misread the cues and thus mis-read the film. Put simply, Collateral Beauty is an essay on grief psychosis that is made bearable by framing its premise around magical realism.At a superficial level, the plot is straightforward. Howard (Will Smith) used to be a charismatic leader of a very successful advertising agency until, two years ago, he lost his six-year old daughter. He cannot come to terms with her death, his marriage is shattered and the agency is in trouble, while he cannot even speak the words ""my daughter Olivia died of cancer"". Seeking catharsis, he writes letters to three abstract entities, Death, Time, and Love. But his letters are intercepted by a private investigator hired by his colleagues who want to either shake him out of his depressive stupor or have him certified unfit to run the company. Three actors representing Death, Time, and Love are hired to confront Howard and goad him to externalise his suppressed grief. They convince him that nobody else can see them although each encounter is secretly filmed as evidence. Each of his three colleagues have personal dramas in their own lives, as do each of the three actors hired to confront him, and of course his therapist has problems of her own. In terms of narrative structure, films do not get more complicated than this.If the structure is not sufficiently perplexing, there are frequent non-signposted transitions between layers of reality that leave viewers uncertain that what they are seeing is actually happening rather than a figment of a disturbed mind. Despite excellent acting from a stellar cast and a brisk pace of storytelling, this film presents insurmountable challenges for viewers wanting easy entertainment. However, what has been described by most critics as a total mess of a film is, for this reviewer, a lyrical fable of mixed realities that reflect the turmoil inside Howard's head. When he first utters those words he could not speak, it is gut-wrenching.If this film was re-imagined with the cast in 17th Century costumes and Howard as the innkeeper of the best establishment in the land, with the three actors, Death, Time, and Love played as ephemerals that materialised and then disappeared, it would be described as a universal tale of Shakespearean proportions. But instead, it is a highly original story in an age where originality is hard to find. It is also a complex, challenging, and deeply thought-provoking story capable of reaching deep inside your soul, if only you let it."
" Most beautiful film of 2016 !
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,9,"Avoid the critics, it's at your risks. I had to give up on so many good movies because of their incoherent reviews.Not to say that I speak the entire truth but I finally watch this film. Had to tell myself, OK I will check this on TV. What a major error. This film is about how we, the humans, react if someone from our family dies. And it's truly the way to do it. And to give hope with all theses great characters. For once, a ''top notch'' list of actors are well used and even if some are not in the films for a long time like Keira Knighley or Naomie Harris, their roles are as important as the rest. Will Smith lead the film but the true leading role is death himself... then love then the time. It's an important film about how we react as a society to this tragic affair.Love Michael Pena, Helen Mirren and Edward Norton in this as they portray their roles perfectly ! Kate Winslet shines as usual but seems to be more in her element than before.Don't listen to critics but listen to me... buy tons of Kleenex."
" If you know what the grief is you are not gonna like it !
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,5,"The movie is OK, but the way it is trying to explain the grief has nothing to do with the reality. Another Hollywood movie that pretends to give us some truths about the life, but just polishes the surface and gives people completely wrong picture what the pain of loosing someone is. On the plus side, it tries to raise the awareness of the problem that people avoid like a fire and nice music too."
" The Vidiot Reviews...
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,5,"Collateral BeautyLosing someone is very difficult, especially when they didn't tell you any of their online passwords.Fortunately, the deceased in this drama was too young to have that many PINs.Spiraling into depression after losing his daughter, ad executive Howard (Will Smith) starts penning angry letters to Love, Death and Time.When his business partners (Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Michael Peña) discover this they hire actors (Keira Knightley, Helen Mirren, Jacob Latimore) to portray those concepts and confront Howard publicly.However, their scheme to get him deemed insane makes them reevaluate their own feelings towards those intangibles.A failed attempt at an uplifting ensemble, the hokey premise gets more pathetic and laughable as it limps towards to its overemotional ending. Not even its credible cast can save it from the sentimental scrapheap.Besides, the only letters you should be sending after losing someone are those addressed to mail-order bride websites.

" Very important movie!
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,10,"Everyone that had a death in the family ,would probably relate more to this movie. This movie has a great message about life. Everyone needs to learn from it. I want to say thank you, to all the actors and all the people that were involved in this movie.I watched this movie twice, because it was so emotional to me and it got me re thinking on my life, after my mother's death."
" Truth. Powerful. Inspiring.
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,8,"Firstly I'd like to say, I loved this film. If you have the right perspective & depth, you will understand the message & take it in. This is no rom-com, it is a drama & it will be upsetting. I can only sympathise with anyone that has gone through such an ordeal, but don't forget the ""collateral beauty"".Love. Time. Death.Three of the most, if not thee most Important principals of life. Love is purpose, Time is the gift & death is the end. In this film each three of these is manifested & played out to a grieving Dad (Will Smith), who lost his daughter from an early age. There is also a nice symmetry between other characters, showing these three things affect others in much different ways.With out giving to much away, all I can now do is urge people to give this a watch, but don't just watch it, feel it & understand it. It's certainly given me food for thought."
" I haven't seen a movie this good in a long time
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,10,"The story of this movie is SO well written, it's actually mesmerizing to watch. The characters are perfectly cast. I couldn't have handpicked better matches to play the roles. I've always loved Will Smith better as a drama actor despite his impeccable comedic timing, but this definitely takes the cake. A performance put alongside Seven Pounds and the Pursuit of Happiness proudly. It was also great to see Edward Norton come back in this movie. It's the perfect soft comeback needed. All in all, the movie is definitely worth your time and money. You will not regret the 2 hours spent watching it."
" If you have children
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,10,A 10/10 from me.This movie really touched me. Especially because I have children and understand his emotions.Fabulous actors in the movie and a great story from the beginning to the end.It is really recommendable - both because Will Smith once Again shows that he is up for this kind of drama movies like Pursuit of Happiness and also because it is like a puzzle that needs to come in place.A movie that will touch your heart.
" Greed, lust for dollars, surpassed by Love, Death & Time.
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,7,"Very brief summary: Greed and selfishness have byproducts. If only the greedy and selfish knew. This is a deep, DEEP movie. Philosiphically deep, I mean. A place where movies usually fear to tread. Hats-off, to stellar acting by all. And Especially Will Smith and Helen Mirren for taking the project on. Initially, it's hard to ""unite"" with the film. It's all ""setup."" And worth the discomfort.Bravo.At least, a seven in my humble opinion."
" Very interesting movie, worth your time.
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed the movie, the actors played their parts wonderfully well. the story-line is good, and the directing excellent. maybe its because of the caliber of actors used.Will Smith has been good in all his emotional movies i have watched him act on. In all, it worth the time."
" Absolutely false boring stupid story
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,1,"A lot of stars, extremely serious items... but absolutely stupid plot, irreal unconvincing behaviour of characters, no humour, no idea, no thought, no imagination about kid's death, no imagination about your coming death. Disappointed, ashamed for stars and, the most - for director."
" A great piece of art
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,10,"Its a great piece of art, no extensive special effects needed to be used or skin to be barred or redundant sex to be used, as it is now a days in most of films that are coming out.Excellent acting, superb story. I hope they make more stuff like this in the future"
" I almost didn't watch this movie because of its IMDb rating, but thank God I have watched it. It is profound and beautiful
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,10,"Totally worth it. It makes you feel love, think about time and rethink about death. Wonderful actors and actresses and each one of them with a beautiful and unique character. It is a must. You have to watch it. Don't let the ratings fool you. This time IMDb rating is wrong.If you want to see a movie that teaches you something, this is a very good option."
" Wow...to the negitive reviewers and for the greater public.
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"To the person looking for an honest review... First this film in my opinion is fantastic. It is well crafted, well directed and well acted.Normally I follow the ratings on IMDb quite closely and rarely enjoy a film below a 7 unless it is about something I am truly interested in. Now I admit that on first viewing the film might seem a little confusing but if your willing to watch it again then you can see how truly remarkable it is and how it was truly done a disservice by its marketing (ironic much?) but in the marketing's defense, this film is hard to market without spoiling something. So instead of trying to keep everything a secret they expose everything which is doubted because of the beginning. Please watch and figure out whether you like it or not yourself instead of relying on the opinions of others who have nothing good to say about anything (i.e. the entire gaming community).Now if your reading this without seeing the movie, I would highly suggest not reading farther because this is where the major spoilers will be stated.On first watch you might come to believe that Love, Death and Time are just actors being hired by the assholes trying to take the business away from Howard or you will come to believe that they are actually who they pretend to be but be confused to why they needed to come in contact with Whit, Clair and Simon and create something so complicated. Answers: They are who they portray and not only are they effecting Howard but helping all the others around him. Death talks to Simon who is dying. Time talks to Clair who is done trying to have a kid because she doesn't believe she has time. Love talks to Whit who struggles because he feels like he is loosing the love of his daughter and is starting to give up on her. Everything they are saying starts to now make sense and the fact that death talked to Howard's wife also makes sense."

The plot itself is so original, the screenplay is absolutely captivating and the performance shown and given by each actor (especially Helen Mirren which I adore- to me, her acting is beyond natural, she is the character, she no longer acts like the best actress, she's beyond that, she's the god of all actors). I watched the movie with my mom sitting next to me, and I looked at her whilst watching the movie and I saw a coat of tears in her eye, a second away from dropping down her face. I felt as if her tear is held hostage in her eye. Withholding itself, just from my mom's fear of god forbid loosing any of us, her children. I cried (to be accurate- wept whilst kissing my mom on the cheek afraid of loosing her), I felt joy, anger, fear, wanting to scream with the empathy I felt towards each character, I was in an emotional storm like a nine month's pregnant woman. It's brilliant."
" Masterpiece if you can see what they see
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,10,"My review really can't do justice to how impressive this film was. The music selected compliments the film perfectly, the script is simple yet clever and the acting was strong and well balanced throughout. But what really hit home for me in this film was the depth of the words chosen to describe the meaning of collateral beauty and allowed me to understand the underlying meaning wholeheartedly.If you look at it on the surface alone and just see it as some wishy washy feel good film sure, you won't think it anything special. But if you reflect on your life and you ask yourself about what makes you happy and how you can keep that happiness with sad times constantly entering your life, then this film might show you something you've never looked at in life and for that it's more than just a 10/10 film."
" Most adults will appreciate this rendition of a heart felt story masterly portrayed.
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,9,"Not all movies need to follow the same text book and vanilla plot and story line. This piece was beautifully written, exceptionally portrayed and delivered every bit of emotion it was meant to.While I'll be honest in the fact that it definitely wasn't Edward Norton's best piece of work and disappointingly he brought down the over all quality of this film, Will Smith (as always) boosted this challenging story to a height beyond expectation. The supporting cast was also extremely strong and aided in the overall success of this film.In reading the other reviews, I've heard this story as being a sad one. Without question, it's based on an extremely sad under tone however, I believe the over arching message that morphs from this is far deeper and draws out inspiration, courage, love and understanding. Watch it. It's worth it."
" Concussion
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,2,"Will Smith might had got away with it in the film Seven Pounds but he had no need to return to this well again for Collateral Beauty.The film has a Twilight Zone type reveal at the end, by which point the film has fallen of the cliff.Will Smith plays Howard a charismatic advertising agency boss who we see giving his staff an inspirational pep talk at the start of the film.We then go forward three years later where Howard is in the dark depths of depression after the death of his six year old daughter. His business is going down the drain as lucrative ad contracts are getting terminated and his partners are worried. They include Whit (Ed Norton) Claire (Kate Winslet) and Simon (Michael Pena) who all have been waiting patiently for Howard to snap out of it and all tried to help out in whatever ways they could. They also have problems of their own such as Whit having been through a messy divorce has a daughter who does not want know him and Simon facing a serious illness.The three executives hatch a bizarre elaborate plan by calling in a private investigator to at least salvage the future of the company somehow. They then get actors from a theatrical company to bother Howard by portraying the spirits of love, death and time after they discovered some letters Howard has written to these existential beings.So these three actors now pop out of nowhere to talk to Howard, the private investigator films them and even makes out that no one else can see these beings and that Howard is talking to himself.Strangely the actors playing the spirit help resolve issues that the executives who hired them have. Such as Helen Mirren who portrays the spirit of death brings solace to Simon as we see his health deteriorating.There is also a ludicrous side plot where Howard finally goes to a bereavement group meeting and gets to talk to Naomie Harris who runs it and she seems to have success in getting through to Howard, however the viewer might be left with a feeling of drowning in treacle with this particular story.The film is mawkish, sentimental rubbish with an all star cast. If I was Simon facing death myself and unable to leave something to my family because the business could collapse as my fellow partner cannot move on from the death of his daughter. I would had given Howard a left hook."
" This movie changed my outlook on life.
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,10,"No words can describe how utterly amazing this film is, my whole life - for the good 13 years i have been in it - consisted of crap i don't need to worry about. Time is what you make it. Love is not what you are on the outside but what impact you make to the person who loves you back. Death is not the end, yet i still think there is no heaven. I type these words so that maybe one single person will read this and know I'm not any average secondary school student. I am whoever i want to be, no one but me dictates what i do on this short life we live. Now you can go and laugh at me and say ""What would a 13 year old know"" because i really don't care. Life is what i want it to be whether good or bad. And so as i conclude my review ill leave you with one thing, I love who i am, i love life, i understand death and i don't care what anyone else says."
" Not the way to do it.
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,4,"This film got absolutely skinned alive by the critics. And I can kind of see their point. The story focuses on Will Smith's character Howard, who is on complete lock down after the tragic death of his daughter. He creates domino buildings and writes to Time, Love and Death (a reference to speech he made in the beginning before his daughter died) His three friends (Norton, Winslet and Pena) are struggling to keep their company alive as Howard won't commit to his work, or even talk. So they devise a plan that will make it appear that Howard is insane in order to sell their company. They do that by hiring three struggling actors to pretend they are Time, Love and Death and filming it with the actors edited out. If this sounds utterly wrong, it is. Seeing Howard's three best friends gaslight him the way they do in the film is pretty hard to watch. Keira Knightley's character repeatedly states that what they're doing is horrible and morally wrong. And she's right. And there are no real comeuppances to the act. When a movie isn't sure how it's marketed, or if it wants to be a comedy or a drama, you know it's going to get a thrashing. I personally loved seeing the actors, but the script is so paper-thin, superficial and misguided in its message, it slowly becomes more and more cringe-worthy.Finally, the trailer for this film presents a COMPLETELY different story to the one we see. But even if it did play out the way we thought we did, it still would have been terrible. It pushes too hard to be sentimental and forced that it feels rammed down your throat. There's a lot of wasted talent in this. Too bad."
" Am so so so happy I saw this movie despite the bad press
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"Just don't understand what there wasn't to like. For me if you like Will Smith, or you've seen Seven Pounds and thought it was a great surprising story, full of emotion and intrigue, then see this movie.Kate Winslet, Ed Norton, Keira Knightley, Helen Mirren and Will Smith. A slowly evolving tale of life, and what happens to people every day. And the different ways we react. It was so well thought out, and delivered itself almost poetically.Wonderful, beautiful and clever."
" Most thought provoking movie in a while.
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,9,"If you like to engage your brain as well as being entertained then this movie is for you. This movie is thought provoking with many threads weaved together within the main plot. Not all of them are resolved within the movie, and it leaves you with many ""but what about..."" or ""why didn't they.....""If you are looking for something different from all the action movies, then this is worth looking at."
" Deeper than you would expect
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,10,"This is a very well written, very well done film. from reading the reviews, I don'f think people get the significance of the actors, and how much they mean to the other characters in the film and the healing they deliver, and not just to Will smiths character. Death, Time and Love each give something else to whomever needs it. Very well done!"
" A movie that really understood the meaning of life...
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,9,"This is the first movie that I have watched that addresses the meaning of life but in a way that it focuses on the real emotions that many go through. Unlike other movies, it doesn't pull on the strings of the obvious emotions. Instead, 'Collateral Beauty' structured itself in the form of spoken word poetry. Taking the viewer into a roller-coaster of true emotion. This movie isn't your ordinary drama but it's one that needs you to really understand the fight that people go through when either, losing or have lost a battle in life.Many would give this a poor rating as they would expect Smith to be his usual comedian. Many would fail to understand the connection of faith, hope and illusion."
" Best Emotional movie ever!
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,10,This was one of the most saddest but best movies i have ever seen.I recommend it for everyone to see.It is Emotional from The beginning to the end.You need to be strong at some moments because it is very Sad.If i could give it more stars ..I Would.P.S Don't walk away when your watching this movie you will miss important things!
" A Hollywood Masala Flick
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"This movie is bearable and is not , not even close to the league of 7 Pounds or The Pursuit of Happiness. While the premise was heavy and deals in heavier subject, grief of losing a child. The entire story was all so perfect for all of the characters and everyone needed time, love and death and in right time right place... it feels so unrealistic and boring at times and so so predictable. In India we would call it a Hollywood Masala Flick because the movie and the screenplay tried using all of the ingredient of emotion available to them and yet could not strike a chord in many many hearts....Finally just a one time watch if you don't have anything else to do."
" excellent movie! F the critics who have never created a movie in their life and gave less than 5 stars!
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,10,excellent movie! F the critics who have never created a movie in their life and gave less than 5 stars! watch it. Privately if you can Will Smith acts a mentally unstable and does a really good job.Movie is synergized during the whole length period. Too bad it was left without the relationship that was developing with the other two heroes of the movie. they just left it for us to figure out.
" Constant Dyspepsia
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,3,"This movie comes with a reputation for its unintended consequences. This is not entirely fair. The film is not particularly egregious and is quite typical of its kind. It lacks a plot, the story is superficial and predictable. It is rather like a short story written by a sensitive adolescent who yearns to write deep and ever so meaningful things about life and love and how we are all connected and it's so wondrous. Golly gosh!In other ways it is like the American remake of Wings of Desire. Where the German film was written with care and precision, setting a line between the boundaries of existence and eternity, the American remake was a sickly, mawkish, obvious work which traded on the idea for a cable television weepie.Almost aware of its weak premise, Collateral Beauty occasionally pricks at its platitudes but that doesn't convince because the work is based on bad writing. This is apparent in the title, an illiterate clanger, which is picked apart in the film for its failings as an incomprehensible oxymoron. Yet, we are asked to continue believing in something that is flawed. It may be that in years to come this film is adored and constantly on rotation on some new media platform, as yet uninvented. ""It's a Wonderful Life"" had bad reviews on release and it grew into an overly loved piece of schlock with the same level of noxious banalities. The possibly is there but if so future viewers are warned to have tissues and stomach medication handy for frequent involuntary regurgitations."
" A must watch
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,9,I am happy that i watched this movie. Wonderful work by the actors and a great story plot. I am equally happy for not taking critics or other reviews seriously. Will smith stand out again................ a better music score would have helped. The box office collection shows that this movie a great watch to see some serious acting and an important thing to learn about life
" It's on point in all the right places
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,10,"We need a movie like this from time to time. It's written so well. I wish I had read the book first. These movies help is to take a step off the fast wheel and just take a moment to think. I think the movie demonstrates a certain feeling that we all become quite numb in our lives. Numb to other people's feelings, numb to our own needs and numb to our pain and to the needs of others. It doesn't surprise me that someone would write a dreadful review about this movie. I ask for what motive? Movies are not for everyone. There are many movies that I don't like but I don't feel compelled to scrutinise what was bad or wrong about it. I have grown up with Will Smith and I have always loved his movies. I think if you love Will Smith you'll just love this movie anyway. Love, Tine Death, three key things that connect us all. It's true. And this movie has the ability to relate to anyone who is perceptive of their circumstances, surroundings and open to possibilities and ideas. This movie is a wonderful journey, I never picked my phone up once, I was intrigued and absorbed with this compelling tale of grief. Yes it deals with grief yet it doesn't bring you down. A great cast! Simply perfection. The story is more than it seems and if you connect with it you will make some links and realisations and messages will reach out to you, mostly about the importance of trust and human kindness. It's nice to believe in that, after a bad day when you feel invisible to almost everyone. The composer surprised me, refreshing and really in touch with the emotional narrative of this journey. Well done all round. Deserved winner of any award."
" A Very Emotional Movie
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,10,"I can't believe some of the low ratings on here for this movie. I was expecting to see at least an ""8"" rating. This movie is very Emotional and a tear jerker. I guess the viewers who gave this movie a low rating is because they can't connect with the true emotional state of the characters. I won't go in depth about this movie as other reviewers had already done so, but this is a MUST SEE movie if you are a compassionate person who can connect with one's loss and how painfully it is to accept life's tragedies but is also able to treasure the ""beauty"" and the times you spent together before the tragedy."
" Collateral Beauty (2016)
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,5,"Collateral Garbage. Seriously. I'm going to break this down though. When I first saw the trailer for this film, my immediate thoughts were ""wow this looks like a really emotionally manipulative film"". And that is exactly what it is. But its even worse. This film was panned by most critics and I can see why. However, being the film lover that I am I decided to watch it to form my own opinion. Boy oh boy, I wonder why so many credible actors took the role for this film.First things first, the trailer for this film is incredibly misleading. Talk about manipulating right off the bat. Love, Death, and Time are three actors hired by Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, and Michael Pena to follow Will Smith's character and prove that he is crazy so he can give up his position in a flailing company. Why is the company failing? Smith's character recently lost his daughter to a rare disease and has been depressed and unfocused since. While the film may sound like it has heart, it does not. Its so misguiding and you can't even forgive how ridiculous the premise of the film is.I hate when trailers set you up for a certain film but then throw a bad curveball. This is the case with this film. I also feel bad for the acting talent (Knightley, Mirren, Winslet, Norton) who probably didn't look at the script before signing on for this film. I think Will Smith is a solid actor but he almost always picks bad films (especially recently). This film becomes downright infuriating at times. I can't get into it much because it would spoil the film but wow the end of this film is so, so stupid. There's multiple ""twists"" for the sake of being quirky but its really bad writing.This film is so misguided. The writings bad, I think someone should have checked it and edited it before putting it out there as the final product. If you are interested in the film based on watching the trailer be forewarned, that this film will pull a punch on you. Its an over-emotional, sappy, and at times incoherent but convenient mess. I am so glad that my number one BAE Rooney Mara did not follow through on this crap.5/10"
" Very enjoyable
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Found the film to be really good and thought provoking. Checked the ""critics"" ratings and was surprised to see it rated as low as it was. It has an excellent cast whom I thought delivered good performances. The film was different and it was impossible to work out the ending. The ending had surprises and although it was sad in some parts it made you realise why it was titled Collateral Beauty."
" Think this could be a Christmas Classic, someday.
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,7,"So I read somewhere that Collateral Beauty does not have what it takes  to be a Christmas Classic. I'm not sure about that, you be surprise how  many Christmas Classic don't have what it takes to be Christmas  Classics.   It took a While for It's a Wonderful Life to become an X-mas Classic  Smith plays a man who is shocked to the core with the lost of his  daughter and can't do anything else, but in an attempt to wrap his head  around it he starts writing letters to Time, Love, and Death and things  get crazy when they respond to these letters.  I think we were all expecting something more form big Willie and he did  not deliver. They can't all be magical ones, but we were expecting pure  magic.  I got to admit though, this movie should have been magic not just  because of the Fresh Prince. He lead a very stellar cast of fine as  wine actors. With such power houses at Ed Norton, Kate Winslet and  Helen Mirren leading the charge   So it's not a bad movie at all, possibly not as good as the cast that's  in it, you'd expect more but you never known sometime down the line  this could be a new Christmas Classic. Let's see how many people stream  it on Netflix."
" A Perfect Theme-Must be seen
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,10,"Theme is hard, but very well processed. Scenario and acting was excellent. Movie can keep watcher's interest continuously from beginning to the end. Sections are arranged perfectly, and you don't only watch the movie only, also ""feel deeply"". Especially Will Smith has perfect performance."
" Cheesy & Quotable. Works For Me.
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,6,"Cheesy, cliché, contrived, overdone? Yes, yes, yes, and yes. I know it, but I still loved it. Liked the twist. Loved the quotable quotes. Serious matters addressed, but the comic relief was there. Without Will Smith, I probably would have given this an 8. A 7/10. To me, this is a great film that I would watch many times again. ""I thought you couldn't afford therapy anymore."" ""I can't. It was my Uber driver."" ""Wait. They have a CSI Cleveland now?"" ""Be sure to notice the collateral beauty. It is the profound connection to everything."" ""You lived right, my friend. But you are not dying right."" "" I realized that I was not feeling love. I had become love."" Fascinating to learn the actual statistic that 79% of couples divorce after losing a child. Makes sense. My favorite: ""I am love. I am the fabric of life. I am the only 'why'... I was there in her laugh but I am also here now in your pain. Do not try to live without me."""
" A Great Film
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie with a girlfriend. Normally we disagree on what we see, but after watching Collateral Beauty we both gave it top marks. After arriving back home we looked at some of the reviews from the professional critics and couldn't believe the belittling comments some of them had made. It was as if they had all agreed to slag off the film, and have a collective pop at Will Smith. We even wondered whether we were living on a parallel universe where everything is the reverse of what it is here! This is a very deep movie, with some great acting, especially from Will Smith. The themes were those that affect everyone, Love, Time, and Death. And ultimately, the film hints at the collateral beauty which we totally miss when bereaved, and rarely see during a normal busy day. Should have won an Oscar for best film, and Will Smith for best actor. And I think ""Time"" will prove the critics very wrong."
" Too bland
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,3,"This movie isn't exactly profound in nature. It tries to be but ultimately fails once you realize that the entire premise of the movie is that ""trauma"" can be overcome by an abundance of lies (from close ones). I kid you not. At the end of the day it ultimately boils down to the moral compass of the viewer. If you're in the ""the ends justify the means""-camp you'll definitely like this movie. But if you don't subscribe to this moral paradigm you will have a hard time liking this particular flick. This entire movie is basically about a guy who is ""beaten down by life"" because of his daughters death and all that his ""supposed"" friends do is lie and deceive him to further their own careers. What turned out to be exceptionally surprising was the way in which most of the protagonists talked about and handled money. They seemed very out of touch with reality.Also, the movie itself is technically a great deception. It tries to nonchalantly justify the wrongdoings of the protagonists by highlighting the positive outcome that ensued. Very Machiavellian.And to top it all off the ending was made deliberately confusing. As a matter of fact some might even call it ridiculous in the truest sense of the word. I know, I'm being very nebulous in my telling but you'll understand what I mean once you watch the movie."
" Not the Greatest but Definitely Worth Seeing
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,8,"This is a movie that has heart. The story is not flawless and there are some predictable moments but at the same time, the journey is worth taking. The biggest challenge for the movie is the number of characters that it has at its core. There are seven characters with significant roles (an argument could be made for eight). Three characters act primarily as catalysts for the action. But still, that's a lot of characters to develop in a short period of time. As a result, the challenges that three of the characters are dealing with are spilled out onto the audience. All the actors are believable in their roles- --I just wish there was more time to develop their individual characters.I believe 20 more minutes of running screen time would have done wonders for this film. In spite of its shortcomings, I believe that it provides an emotional experience at the end of the film and also some poignant thoughts to ponder. Not perfect, but definitely worth seeing. It has heart."
" Takes various gambles ... most of which come off ultimately
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,9,"Like any sensible cinemagoer, I don't want to know too much in advance, and am PARTICULARLY glad not to have heard beforehand how the critics panned ""Collateral Beauty"" - given that I feel - OVERALL - they were wrong to do so. ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, I'm more than happy to say positive things here.It will be clear from that that I DO recognise how ""CB"" could have gone off the rails. But my conclusion, my gut feeling after actual exposure, is that IT DID NOT DO SO... For literally a couple of minutes at the start of ""Collateral Beauty"", we get to see the Will Smith role we know and love. His Howard Inlet is assertive, sassy and smooth-talking, and the talk he's smoothest with concerns his marketing profession, at which he excels, and within which he feels greatest effectiveness will be achieved if activity is predicated on the ever-present nature in our lives of: love, time and death.For the rest of the film (that's 90+ minutes of precious ""time"" that do not drag at all), we have a new side to Will Smith, as Howard's life continues in ruins, despite the passage of some time since the death of his young daughter, for whom his love remains strong, and his denial even stronger... This was an acting challenge for Smith, and there are moments here when we feel he's not quite pulling it off. That's gamble 1 from Director David Frankel (and writer Allan Loeb), but ultimately, IMHO, Smith's work is good enough to meet audience expectations of the portrayal, and one thing Inlet has been doing (apart from domino chains) is penning cynical letters to his former buzzwords of love, time and death.Now it's nearly Christmas, and 3 co-workers of Inlet's (Kate Winslett, Michael Peña and Edward Norton) decide that, if Dickens can have Marley's ghost call upon three spirits to change Scrooge, they can call upon 3 actors to confront and debate with Inlet in those roles of love, time and death! That's Gamble 2, as it's a bit whimsical, a bit James Stewart in the 1940s for 2017. For me it still works. Gamble number 3 is also present here, as our three mates of Inlet's - each of whom has major sadness issues of his/her own - come to the conclusion that, if these strange encounters don't pull Inlet out of his fugue, they can at least be used to prove that he's mad and unfit to run his (their) company. That's a peculiar ambiguity, and circumstances quickly conspire to ensure that it's more likely to be the second purpose that will serve than the first. None of the three want Inlet's company to go down, and they're prepared to be ruthless to save their own necks, basically sympathetic to Inlet as they may be.There's a tension in this plot-line certainly, but this doesn't ruin the film either. Indeed, the setting keeps being dragged back firmly into the no-nonsense world of contemporary New York, and some of the ""Big Apple"" shots are spectacular. And so to love, time and death, as played respectively by Keira Knightley, Maze Runner veteran singer-dancer-actor Jacob Latimore, and star of stage and screen Dame Helen Mirren. Since Naomie Harris also has a key role to play outside of this main line, but in close connection with it, the significant British input into this film will be clear, though only Keira retains her accent, Mirren struggles just a little with her American one, while Harris does the job seamlessly...As it turns out, each of our three figures has two encounters with Inlet (while Harris has several), but each encounter is short. Mostly ""Love"", ""Time"" and ""Death"" have just a couple of lines to deliver to him, often not even done with particularly tangible emotion. Yet, at the moment of delivery, this audience member had tears springing into his eyes without warning. Somewhere, somehow, (familiar) feelings of immense gravitas and importance had been summed up, and the effect was quite masterly. For my money, Latimore and Knightley are even better at this than Mirren, despite having less to say; but in general these are three fine performances - small as they may be in time-terms (that word again). Which brings us to gamble no. 4 that this film takes - the biggest of all. The death of a child is heavy, and - as I've indicated - this not the only life sadness present in this movie. Now a piece of this kind always faces three serious risks. Risk one is that the audience will experience such sadness that the effect of the story-telling instrument is blunted by over-emotion. Risk two is that there will be a rejection of melodrama, with audiences feeling goaded into ridiculing the content. In close connection with that, risk three is that people will feel their emotions have been exploited cynically. Of these three risks, I think it is 3 that ""Collateral Beauty"" comes closest to facing, if emerging triumphantly , and also - narrowly - avoiding the other two risks.Ultimately, ""Collateral Beauty"" keeps its feet in 2017, avoids ridiculous flights of fancy, conveys its message, and does not (quite) obscure that by descending into mawkish sentimentality. While (like the effective ""Me Before You""), ""Collateral Beauty"" comes with Rom-Com packaging, it is drama, if not entirely humourless. For me, this was uplifting overall, meaningful; skating on thin ice certainly, with its methods, but ultimately staying dry - unlike this reviewer's eyes, and those of most of his fellow cinema-goers, male and female. ""Collateral Beauty"" has a large twist (which worked with me), and (probably) also a couple of other ones, which may only come into one's head as one leaves the cinema. This is then far from a forgettable piece, despite what critics seem to suggest."
" Did I see the same Collateral Beauty movie?
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,10,"My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. Unlike some of the reviewers. I thought the acting was excellent, the story asked some questions, the theatre audience chuckled in the right places and people were carrying their tissues as they left the movie. So I guess for audiences (at least the audience I watched this with) - a success. Of course this more sensitive category of movie lays itself open for cynicism and I would not go to see this with a bunch of mates, but with this type of movie I try to sit back and let it gently flow. And it flowed nicely for my wife and I. And we were rewarded with what we thought was an excellent, satisfying ending. If Need For Speed is your favorite franchise this is not for you. But I would give it a chance if I were you, it's a better movie that some of the other reviewers claim but get the tissues ready."
" A total waste of time
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,1,"Only one main thing to say of this movie: the script destroys everything. Not even the great multi-stellar cast could save it. Why do they accept to work in such a sh***y thing in the first place? Believe me, it's not worth it. It's a terrible thing when filmmakers underestimate the intellect of people. And if they wanted to do something magical, why always on f*****g x-mas? When I imagine the millions of dollars spent on producing this I cry for humanity. What were they thinking about? Unbelievable, and trust me, the story is also difficult to believe in. New York looks beautiful though. And also Keira. Such a pity."
" A movie made worse than it altead6 was due to its awfully ordinary screenplay and somehow managed to get some good actors and even that couldn't help.
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,4,"Collateral beauty is the kind of movie that you'd want to gouge your eyes out and push a pistol down your throat so deep that even shooting it isn't required anymore so much that even your subconscious mind doesn't understand why you would possibly put your eyes and your holy body through the torture of watching the movie till the end irrespective of how many times you yearned to just not watch this pointless bullshit. And then you ask yourself how the heck did the director, producer and the casting crew managed to get a questionable amount of actors with such phenomenal history of acting to act in this sheer stupidest screenplay ever!"
" Nice but.. (possible spoiler)
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,6,"A moving movie, to which I would have given a much better rating only if the scene between the hero and the group therapist wouldn't have turned this way close to the end.I find it very disappointing, as far as the scenario is concerned, as if it were necessary to unfold one's history and re-conciliate with one's past, rather than create a new one, a new hope, a new life, towards which the movie seems to give clues.I've been there watching the movie, in which I was believing close to its end, when I watched the scene, I said no no no, what the .. have the scenarists done ?? The end is nice, though, as the whole movie, apart from that. I don't know whether the movie comes from a book or real story, and if so, I apologize to the scenarists."
" A great film with a fantastic cast
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,Yet another occasion that I'm glad I didn't listen to the critics. This film had everything in it for me and Will Smith once again showed what a fantastic actor he truly is. It has a great cast of award nominees (including Dame Helen Mirren) who make this film a real roller-coaster of emotions. Each actor having their own unique part to play giving the film great depth. This is my first ever review on IMDb and it's because I enjoyed the film so much and I believe the critics got it so very wrong on this occasion! I felt I had to stand behind the film and great actors to prove this is not the underdog of films but can stand side by side with many great films.
" An unconventional film that works because of it
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,8,"As you're watching some movies you just know that you love them, and conversely some movies you just know that you despise them. Then there are films like 'Collateral Beauty' which can have you stumped as to your true feelings about them. It wasn't until the final five minutes of the film that I actually worked out I liked it. There was a reason for that though. At about the halfway point in the film you work out that the ending is going to be absolutely crucial to how you feel about the film. Without spoiling anything, I'll simply say that this could not afford to have a standard ""Hollywood"" type ending. In some ways it was, but overall it was different and unique enough to make the whole thing work.There's nothing conventional about 'Collateral Beauty'. The story is told in an almost bizarre way at times, and I think this is a large reason why some people are being tricked into thinking they didn't enjoy it. It's also a very depressing film in its tone. There's a lot of very sad and impactful scenes that you need to brace yourself for.There's obviously an all-star cast lined up for this one. Will Smith in the lead role thoroughly impressed me. We learnt even as far back as a particular episode of 'The Fresh Prince of Bel Air' that he had impressive acting range. He still has it to this day and will get his much cherished Oscar one day I suspect. The one who disappointed me though was Edward Norton. Not in terms of his performance, but in his choice of role. He's so much better than what he was given to work with here. In the right role he's one of the finest actors ever to work in the industry. This was certainly not one of those roles.'Collateral Beauty' really surprised me in terms of how much I enjoy it. There are certain ""cheesy"" elements to it if you want to look at them that way, but to do so would be a negative way of perceiving things in my opinion. I think the thing I liked most about the entire film though was that it made no apologies, because life makes no apologies. It may not be to everyone's liking, but I think it will certainly be enjoyed by more people than the critics are suggesting."
" Walt's 100 Words
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,6,"The real tragedy is we'll never know how Hugh Jackman would have approached the role taken by Will Smith in another of his box office Vanity Project failures. This is not to say Collateral Beauty is a failure. It explores one of the biggest questions in all our lives. What is your Why? Why do you get up in the morning etc. Plus we get to meet Love, Death and Timethe three quintessential elements of life. In the words of singer Marcia Hines, ""This show is deep"". And what a cast with Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Helen Mirren, Kierra Knightley and more. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll sigh! Isn't that how any movie should engage with it's audience?"
" I Still Do Not Apprehend What Is ""Collateral Beauty""
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,5,"Love, time and Death are the three abstractions connecting each human being with existence nature, they regulate our steps in the earthly world and rule a concatenation of situations personally related to a superhuman religious power. Based on these three conceptualizations, Christmas wager of Warner Bros. seeks to provide a life-giving message through the long-drawn-out dose of lachrymose content that after all it just got is to try the audience's patience and supply a wrong composition and emphatically distant to what it is proposed.Howard (Will Smith) opens with a poignant speech about the life pillars, in which manifests optimism and vitality of being in command of an increasing advertising agency. Two years later, a downcast man by depression, fatherly devastation, sadness and melancholy appears on screen, usually with an affliction frown and about to immerse himself into a fit of tears. According to his ""colleagues,"" the persistent emotional fluctuation of their chief—he spends the most time stacking up multicolored domino pieces in the form of small forts or constructions for symbolizing each individual fate: everyone will crumble; —is going to make to collapse their advertising company abruptly. To prevent this happening, and with the subterfuge of seeking his social, personal and labor rehabilitation; they determine to hire a group of actors to embody three characters whose their boss sends rejection letters: Love, Time and Death. They are portrayed by Jacob Latimore (Raffi), Keira Knightley (Amy) and an unexpected Helen Mirren (Brigitte) within a deeply unlike role to her triumphant career. All this in order to save the company, redeeming their ""colleague"" and suddenly saving their own lives, each one related to the existing pillars interpreted by the actors.I have to confess that in mid-2015, when I gradually found out about the cast and crew was quite elated and anxious to visualize the suggestive design starring these experienced actors, however, when I slid down on the screen and read the storyline, my expectation was accentuated uncompromisingly. I felt that it was what every film lover demands with devotion in these times of creative vicissitudes; an original story, with unique qualities and fine resolutions.Today, one year and a half later, I have the opportunity to see the film in its entirety, triggering a forceful change of opinion both subjective and objective. First, I noticed an air of magic realism that works to some extent; trying to play with viewers' mind is certainly detrimental since if it does not run with a rigorous and acute diplomacy can cause a powerful cataclysm, and precisely that was what happened to this feature film. In addition to that fanciful aura into a realistic conception of the world—which is far from generating a consistent empathy with the public, —Allan Loeb's script provides a figurative and utopian searching, shuffling the story desire within the three supporting characters: Whit, Claire, and Simon (Edward Norton, Kate Winslet and Michael Peña). While it conglomerates subplots in the story, Howard, the true leading role, moves to the last place, dragging the course of the occurrences out and trying to be a competent work influenced by philosophical issues. Besides this, the staging does not suggest high conception of imagination or invention, adhering to New York in full holiday season, repetitive close-ups of misty-eyed Will Smith, editing of uneven pace and a soundtrack as generic as deficient for jam-packed dramatic moments, which there are every minute.Despite the constant detriments, the film acquires and retains a stimulating ether around the leitmotiv: trying to bring back a loved one. Playing Love, Time and Death of crystal-clear, but at the same time multiple ways is one of their few skills, even getting to arouse fervor with the cardinal aim of the characters. In addition, the task of giving sense to existence reminds us of the classics which managed more than honoring and paying tribute to life itself: ""Life Is Beautiful"" or ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" (starring Smith in 2006).""Collateral Beauty"", directed by David Frankel, feels as the definitive collapse of a joint of erroneous decisions about giving shape to a story, however, above film or narrative standards, the movie is a good choice for those who wish to reaffirm the importance of life, time, death and love.Packed with talented stars, a fortifying central plot and a suggestive final twist, Frankel's celluloid does not deserve such reprimand by movie critics. Is it a confusing and irregular motion picture? Yes, it is, but if we are going to talk together about real dud movies, several heads already lean out."
" Collateral Beauty... MEH
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,5,"Let me preface my 5-star rating by saying that the movie was without a doubt entertaining. It's hard not to be with such a star-studded cast and strong supporting soundtrack to help bring out emotion.I had high hopes for this one. While I must admit to being suckered into such beliefs by the trailers, Will Smith and Edward Norton are two of the greatest Actors of our generation. Sure, they will land some flops (that's just statistics), but I have not been let down by the two in a while.Ultimately this one felt rushed. The back stories for all the supporting cast members (Michael Peña, for example, is dealing with a terminal illness from the get go) was just as depressing as that of Norton and Smith's characters. What this has done is take away from the focus of the leads! With such a glaring error in the way this story was produced, it's difficult not to feel there were less ingenious intentions involved.Too much packed into the script. While the premise was encouraging, it was evident within the first 20 minutes that there would be too much going on here. Everything felt rushed (not enough time invested in character stories).But of all the reasons I suspect this has flopped ($36 mil budget and $29,846,313 mil on opening weekend) the biggest flag for me was this reiteration of ""Collateral Beauty"" being spoken several times throughout... literally! There were several instances of characters mentioning the title of the film (word for word) or regularly revisiting a more typical situation so as to ensure every single person hasn't missed it. Production and Directors: Please stop treating the audience in a way that says we are incapable of detecting the more subtle aspects of a story.Ultimately I give this one five stars because of how great the actors/actress ensemble is. Had production advertised this one in much the same way that we saw in ""New Year's Eve (2011)"" or ""Valentine's Day (2010)"" (whom also packed the cast full of stars) my review would likely be far better. At least I would have known the mediocrity that was to come.I am a huge fan of Will Smith. It cannot be denied that most of what he will touch ultimately end up turning to gold (with the very rare flop such as "" After Earth (2013)""). Himself and Norton should be steering well clear of these kinds of motion pictures.I will conclude with a phrase everyone has likely been told at least once by a parent: ""I'm not upset, just disappointed.""----- 5/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----"
" A deep movie
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,10,"This is a movie that really makes you think and value what you have, appreciate all the blessings around you.All actors played their roles exactly as they should & they've succeeded no matter how long or short their lines were. Many moments of truth, honesty and sometimes reality that we see everyday around us in different ways. Sometimes we need a ""wake up"" message to re-evaluate what is not running well and get it fixed. Pick the track you want to have in life. Make the best use of your relationships. Well done all the cast. One of the very best movies ever."
" I would't recommend it.
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,5,"This is not a horrible movie and you're capable to see it through, but absolutely nothing more. The idea is kind of cool and the story could work. The problem is that it's poorly made and some of the acting is awkward. They tried to be deep and have a secret motive, but it ends up flat. Instead you end up with something that only is weird and doesn't make any sentence. But i must say that both Will smith and Edward Norton does a okay job and tries, but their mediocre performances can't save this move. I usually like Edward Nortons work, but I guess good actor can do bad movies to. Wouldn't recommend the film, but if you do see the film. It wouldn't be the biggest mistake of your life."
" Invites different perspectives
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,8,"This film opened my eyes. Will Smith is one of the most talented actors I have ever seen and he played the role of a grief-stricken father magnificently. My heart broke when his honesty about heartache showed. Somehow just simply writing a letter and receiving a response and become more than an outdated action. This filmed provided answers to questions I hadn't even thought to ask. Complete with plot twists and empowering messages, this isn't a film to miss. While I am bias to any film that Smith acts in, you have to really see it for yourself. I don't cry much in films and this didn't change that for me, but I felt a build-up of emotion that was exciting to experience. See it for yourself, if you don't want to spend $12 on a film you may or may not like, then wait until it comes out in the local video store (if those are still available), it's worth checking out for yourself. This film invites many different perspectives and no matter what the writers and the rest of the cast should be proud of their work."
" May Just Be 2016's Worst Movie
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,2,"I read somewhere that 2016, in addition to having a leap day also included a leap second that the powers that be added unceremoniously to New Year Eve. While the reasons for this are scientifically understandable, the goofy Facebook click-bait that followed the announcement only reinforced the idea that the year was simply not going to end. Watching Collateral Beauty in 2017 is like reliving that extra second of 2016 over and over again over an hour and thirty seven minutes. Much like this past year, I looked on Collateral Beauty with cautious optimism - I then quickly graduated to anger, migrated towards the ""well s**t"" feeling of detachment you get when everything goes off the rails, before finally simpering in my seat praying for the sweet release of death.Will Smith plays a cardboard cutout named Howard whose advertising agency's mantra is based on humanity's relationship to time, love and death (also Dominos). Since the death of his six-year-old daughter however, Howard's become virtually catatonic botching business relationships and new contracts with his constant moping. His business associates Whit (Norton), Claire (Winslet) and Simon (Pena) worry Howard's mental state will ruin the company. Howard is seems worries about nothing anymore.At some point in this train wreck, Howard comes to believe he is having conversations with the concepts of Death (Mirren), Time (Latimore) and Love (Knightley). I will try not to drop any serious spoilers, lest to say Collateral Beauty is not as advertised and the results are about as contrived as a hipsters beard and as morally dubious as enjoying a Nazi romance story. Make no mistake, this movie is such an unholy mess of maligned story elements, faux sentimentality and outdated influences that it did cross my mind that I was living in a Twilight Zone (1959-1964) episode; or at the very least living in a middle school playwright's first draft of his ""edgy,"" first student led play.The inexcusably bad quality of this film is downright absurd considering the talent involved. On their own the fiery instincts of Edward Norton, the marshaled power of Kate Winslet or failing that the stateliness of Helen Mirren should have been enough to save this movie. But much like faded, badly preserved paintings adorning the walls of a Best Western, the actors all just hang there lifeless. Will Smith, our interminably absent lead has surpassed his work in Seven Pounds (2008) to turn in the most painfully artificial character he's ever played. His depictions of a grief stricken father are so insultingly sweeping and tertiary that I honestly believe in preparation for the role he stared at a sad clown painting until he got a migraine.Of course it's not his fault, nor the fault of any of the actors on screen. Much like the Dominos that Howard patiently stacks in his pristine glass office, Collateral Beauty is built on a lousy foundation. I think the film is trying to update the saccharin chastity of Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1946) for modern audiences. But if that's the case, none of that film's clarity of mind survived the transfer. Nor its ability to coax real emotions which this movie fumbles to the point of unintentional hilarity.Collateral Beauty is like watching the cheery, life-affirming moral of ""A Christmas Carol"" being hit by an Uber. The implications of this movie are so thoroughly twisted, the joints of the story painfully exposed and the talent involved have been reduced to nothing more than grease stains. 2016 is over - as of this review it's been over for seven days. But the residue of such a painful year still lives on in the recess of this films putrid, noxious bowels. I guess before it died 2016 really did s**t itself."
" Good idea ?
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,5,"No one knows what is love, no one knows what is time, and no one knows what is death except dead ones. but everyone loves what he shouldn't like, if he knows it, and quantify it with the feeling of time speeding up, and everlasting that precious short past when its gone.

" A creative tapestry of human complexities: philosophical and flourishing!
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,9,"Interesting Drama with a touch of fantasy, emotional, and inspiring. Loved this movie! I have seen it twice.what's about? When an executive loses his 6 year old daughter he also loses his faith in life. He declares himself a stranger from his wife (and divorces) and he jeopardizes his company. Howard (Will Smith), is in state of shock. As such, he writes three letters to the Cosmos: to death, time, and love. In an attempt to save the company, his three advisors, Claire (K. Winslet), Whit (E. Norton), and Simon (M. Pena), agree on a plan: simulate Howard's handicapped mental by hiring a private detective, and three actors to play the roles of time, love, and death. By forcing Howard to confront these three abstractions he comes to the realization that he is in a troubled mental state and should approve the sale of the company to save the jobs of his employees. In the theatrical montage process, these ""actors"" (pay attention here, for they are not really ""actors""!) not only save Howard but also save/help Whit, Claire and Simon from their life's tragedies/dilemmas. Notice the words Sparks, Angels, and the beautiful lighting effects!!the wonderful: I loved the mystery, the suspense, the subtlety in every sentence spoken by these so called actors that each represented death, love, and time. What a fantastic and inspired performance! Knightley as Love, Mirren as Death, and Latimore as Time. Wow, such strength and feeling. I loved the pairing of the ""actors"" with the characters of Claire, Simon and Whit. I thought the message of each one was perfectly crafted and straight to the heart. I think these ""actors"" are angels! What do you think? You might arrive at that realization with the various clues along the story and in the final scene! Just wonderful. I also loved how Will Smith poured his heart and all his humanity in this role. Overall, the cast was fully connected and beautifully synchronized. I thought N. Harris empathetic, heart-reaching vibes were so real! In summation, a beautiful tapestry of human complexities. The Director, David Frankel (D. Wears Prada, Marley), has created a deeply human story with hidden touches of the supernatural! One thing that I found striking was how Death reveals its ""triumph"" to Simon, how Love discovers Whit's troubles, and how Time forecasts life to Claire.The to-think-about-it: Yes this film revolves about a sad, tragic event, but I couldn't let myself cry because the message of collateral beauty was so profound that it overpowered and neutralized pain and tragedy. The message of Time, Love and Death were so transcendental and life-giving! What a paradox! I loved it. I don't consider this film a sad, on the contrary. It is a like a tree which is rooted in tragedy, it's trunk is transformation; and its branches, leaves and blossoms, each are giving us a myriad of clues on how to live our lives to the fullest. Film-take-aways: Collateral beauty It's like noticing and admiring some stray pearls from a broken necklace in the middle of rubble...Of course seeing the collateral beauty in the middle of our tragedies and life's disasters/crisis is hard, but with time it makes itself visible when we allow it to.conclusion: Enjoy this heartwarming, illuminating, beautifully written-and-acted film and take home that collateral-beauty principle and keep it in your life's toolkit forever.Cheers."
" Seeking the Emotional Connections
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,6,"What is 'collateral beauty'? Not many will know about this term, which director David Frankel is using this term as his theme for his latest feature film. Howard (Will Smith) is a successful entrepreneur who runs a media agency together with his three best friends: Whit (Edward Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet) and Simon (Michael Pena). After losing his daughter to a rare brain tumor, he drowns himself in sorrow and isolates himself at work and personal life. An encounter with Amy (Keira Knightley) leads Whit, Claire and Simon came across with a struggling theatrical group which was co-run bu Bridgette (Helen Mirren) and Raffi (Jacob Latimore). Howard's friend intercepted three letters written by him, which the recipient turns out to be: Death, Love and Time. To assist Howard coming out from grief and sorrow, his friends engage the help of Bridgette, Amy and Raffi to play the role of death, love and time respectively. Meanwhile, an encounter with Madeleine (Naomie Harris), the founder of a self-help group for parents who have lost their children to death makes Howard decided to start life all over again. When the trio (Bridgette, Amy and Raffi appear in the form of death, love and time) appears in Howard's life, it makes him question the meaning of life and the importance of overcoming the grief. The term 'collateral beauty' can be simply defined as parents unable to see the damage of their child's death in full picture, but the love and beauty that comes after the death helps to bring people closer to one another. Frankel explores the definition in the film through the connections between the people around Howard. Here, we have seen how Howard has isolated himself from the outside world, which worries his loved ones and his friends (damage). Through the intervention of Bridgette's trio, it helps Howard to pick up the courage to restart his life, while at the same time seeking the possibility of connecting with Madeleine and give himself a second chance in life. Looking at the bigger picture, Frankel also touches on the life of the people surrounding Howard: Whit is patching up his broken relationship with his ex-wife's daughter, Allison, to redeem his infidelity; Claire is seeking a sperm donor to conceive a child due to her age after spending most of her time establishing the career for Howard; Simon fears his family will be unable to support themselves financially after a relapse of cancer he has recovered. The subplot supports the story to move on, which it only helps the audience to understand the term, but also shifts the focus on Howard's grief to avoid boredom. While these subplots seems to be valid and reflects the actual life an individual will encounter, it may be heavy for some who are seeking to entertain than to reflect on their life. Towards the end of the story, audience can feel that emotional toils takes the center stage of the story, though it is not much of an emotional roller-coaster ride. Smith carries the same usual self from his previous films in the similar genre, such as The Pursuit of Happiness, Seven Pounds and Concussion. Though he is the main focus of the story, he has unfortunately unable to engage the audience in the emotional toil he has been through. Not much explanation was given on Smith's Howard wallowing in sorrow, which audience may not be convinced on what has happened, which leads to the undesired behavior he displays when his friend is helping him. Instead, the focus has shifted to Helen Mirren's Bridgette, which she came in as a form of enlightenment to Howard. Besides applying her theatrical knowledge to the role she was given to, her age and appearance have also help the role to look more convincing without too much giveaway. At duration of 97 minutes, there isn't much room for Norton, Winslet, Pena, Knightley, Latimore and Harris to explore their respective roles. The casting is strong to draw the crowds, but it seems to be a waste since not much chance was given to explore the role. There aren't many films like Collateral Beauty which helps an individual to understand social terms in a layman's term. While the star-studded casting makes the movie look promising, there are many areas left unexplained, which makes the movie feel under-whelmed."
" Actually better than I expected
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,5,"Not terrible. Just OK, but nothing special. I could see that there was a nice message in there somewhere, it just ends up being a bit mixed. It is kind of harmless for the most part though. So I can see this being an OK travel film or something like that.Some scenes actually got some laughs out of me. I thought that Will Smith and company really tried hard, but the plot didn't convince me all the way through. There are things I'm very unsure about like some character motivations and a certain Key plan in the film was a little questionable.It could have been worse since I watched it on Friday the 13th after all."
" Like an After-School Special
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,3,"Fantastic acting, especially Will Smith. Some compelling scenes.But it reminded me to much of the movies they used to show at Church. The whole point of this type of didactic movie is to share a message of some sort. The message is more important than the movie, and as a result the movie often suffers artistically. But strangely, I'm not even sure what the message of ""Collateral Beauty"" was.Like a Church movie or an after-school special, there was just too much in-your-face stuff. Constant super-close-ups of the actors' faces while they're having deep conversations, the lingering of the camera for up to five seconds beyond reasonable, to the point where you almost feel like a stalker, and symbolism that is shoved down your throat. Characters that we don't care about that much because they seem, well, too manufactured. Lines that contain some interesting thoughts but because they come out of nowhere have the same impact as a pithy saying on a fridge.I like the idea of collateral beauty. If we look hard enough there may even be some of it in this movie. But as it was I walked away with an unsettled feeling in my stomach, even though I skipped the popcorn."
" Don't listen to the critics!
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,10,"I was reluctant to see this movie because it was slammed by the critics saying it was one of the worse movies of 2016. My daughter asked me to accompany her as she wanted to see the movie so I went along expecting it to be awful. It wasn't. The three actors that play Time, Love and Death are magical and perfectly cast. Helen Mirren plays Death, Jacob Latimore plays Time and Keira Knightly plays Love. Howard (Will Smith) eventually accepts the idea that he's talking to actual Death in a blue hat, to actual Love in a pink coat, to actual Time that rides a skateboard. At the end of the movie, my daughter and I could not move from our seats as we were so overwhelmed by emotion. It got me! For a movie to provoke that kind of reaction in me, I know it really hit the mark. Don't believe what the critics say. It is a great movie!"
" Spiritually Enlightening,
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,8,"Collateral Beauty is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. This is receiving diabolical reviews from critics, and if I was to ask why, I would imagine they were not open enough to truly understand it's message. It is sort of like poetry, in the sense that you will not appreciate a poem you do not understand, there are a lot of complicated elements to this film, plenty of unexpected turns throughout. That all is a message in conveying the massive effect people have on our lives, how love, time and death is the key elements to any person. I would have appreciated some flashbacks, that was the only major downfall for me, it would have served the plot very well to have actually seen Will Smith spending time with his daughter before her passing. It would have made the audience more connected to the character and give us a better understanding of what he is going through. The cast is phenomenal and it saddens me that they may not be receiving any credit that they deserve. Smith, Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Michael Peña, Helen Mirren, Naomie Harris, Keira Knightley and Jacob Latimore all come together to tell a complicated, layered story in which all of them had great arch's, with each character being developed subtly through warm and sincere dialogue. I walked in with low expectations, and I came out with a smile on my face, delighted with what I had viewed, there is truly nothing like it, and I am not afraid to admit I was in tears. Sweet, meaningful and very complicated, the trailers will make it seem basic but there is a lot more to it, Collateral Beauty is worth the watch for anyone looking for a good drama. A man who has lost his daughter begins writing letters to Love, Death and Time, feeling as if they have all betrayed him, he is soon visited by the real things. Best Performance: Will Smith"
" Life story can be boring and intimidating. But this is an interesting journey.
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,7,"Not the final twist to seeing the meet up of two ""strangers."" It is the presence of absence that intrigues the audience. When love is lost, it is found. When time is lost, it is found. The absence of light is darkness, but darkness itself is not a presence. It is a total ruin when the trio stood on the bridge, revealing to the audience their ""real identity."" Whoever decide on it, you insulted the audience, destroyed the aesthetics, like serving skittles as deserts, wasting all the good food (energy) as delivered by each of the key characters. However, each of the character is mostly enjoyable and the acting without acting is highly entertaining. Good job for the soundtracks. People really stay behind for the roller credit and the great song."
" Beautiful movie about Grief and Loss
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,9,"Collateral Beauty captures the feelings of loss, grief and hopelessness so very well. I lost my wife 6 months ago and Will Smith does such a good job of portraying the inner turmoil and struggle to find meaning in life. Putting effort into useless tasks like stacking dominoes in hopes of honoring your lost loved one, wandering aimlessly because you have the time and money to do anything, but nothing seems meaningful anymore now that the love is gone from your life, and reaching out to entities, or God, or the universe in hopes of answers are all things I can relate to on a very personal basis.The wonderful thing about this movie is it takes that feeling throughout the movie and weaves in a tapestry of other feelings from the other characters, their own fears and hopes, their wonder about whether they are doing the right thing as they try to answer how to help Howard, and ultimately themselves, move forward."
" what a pity for such a good title
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,5,"the title and the story idea of this movie could be set for a really good story, and because it does bring across that concept of ""collateral beauty"" it is not a complete waste of time to watch. Unfortunately the movie itself doesn't isn't able to live up to it fully. Even though you get the feeling that the intention was to make it a kind of feel-good pre-Christmas movie à la ""the Holiday"" - there were just too many distracting logical weaknesses in it, such as the scene where Kate Winslet (who is completely under-challenged in her role) walking into a poor area in a designer dress handing over 20K cash and ANNOUNCING it loudly. Most actors aren't given room to develop their role, instead their character is smacked into the audience's face by their situation being talked about or repeatedly displayed (Winslet's wish for a child). Keira Knightley is best at portraying her ""one-smile-fits-all-situations"" face. The only acting highlight is Helen Mirren's performance."
" Don't listen to the critics, they appear to be writing more about themselves
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,9,"The critics nearly put us off seeing this beautiful film, i cried, i giggled, i was surprised and i was taken out of my world for a couple of hours, what more do you want for £10. The acting was amazing, I loved this film and recommend it! Unfortunately i have been told by IMDb to write more about the film, which i don't feel the need to do as i have said everything that i feel. This film was thought provoking, deep, beautifully and written I don't see how anyone could think its anything other than a drama. If you liked Pursuit of happiness starring Will Smith you will like Collateral Beauty. Go and see the film and make up your own mind!"
" Very Nice, a Great movie
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,10,"I saw it last night. It's very nice, indeed, it is a great movie, to buy as well as to see! And most critical reviewers'd better change job, I can not say whether they are more obtuse or more in bad faith. An existentialist film, speaking about real and common situations of suffering in a sincere direct but gentle way. And also with a light humor which is typical of the serious things of real life. It is time for our neurotic society to start talking about real things in real life that we pretend are no more: loneliness, sickness and death. And above all it is time we start talking about it together. And found a new direction too. The end of this movie is very beautiful, smart and - almost - unexpected. I admit that -even considering myself very Viking style- in the end, as a dad, I spent one tear, more of surprise and joy than pain. Highly recommended to everybody!"
" 7.5/10 Very good . It's about love and loss
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"I'll be honest I wasn't expecting to like this and I'm glad I didn't read any reviews before seeing it. Casting is key here , I'm not a Will Smith fan , Ali aside his acting hasn't impressed me but this had him showing all his emotions, superb supporting cast .A story that is much deeper than it's surface that will have you asking questions after. My only advice would be to say go and watch it like I did low expectations and you just might be pleasantly surprised by how moved you were by the drama like I was. The back stories help draw out the plot and strengthen the theme that it's All about love and loss Pad.A"
" it is not necessary, just read the review.
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,8,"I know this could seem a common American drama movie with a great famous cast. However it is not for me. I loved the link between the three spirits (love, death, and time) and every character of the story. The spirits (who have been considered real humans till the end of the movie)were paid by three people to let everybody understand that a man who have lost his daughter was not ready to take decisions for the company that they work for. However, the spirits helped this man who have lost faith in love, who his daughter died, and who did not care about the time anymore; and a at the same time the three spirits helped the three people who hired them. The spirit of death helped the man who had a cancer and was dying, the spirit of the time helped the woman who with the passing of the time did not manage to have a baby, an the spirit of love helped the divorced man who needed to conquer the love ho her daughter who hates him because she considered his father guilty of the divorce. At the end, the two words ""collateral beauty"" said by the spirit of death sound like magic. They could mean everything we understand. For me they mean: the beauty behind the drama, the joy of keep going despite the bad things that happen in our life, the love to share our hope with somebody that we really care about. In conclusion, this movie give a sensation of magic in the air, it is an original classic movie which will not let you down."
" Remind me again why this got bad reviews?
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,10,"Arguably one of the best movies i've ever seen. It has a deep message and delivers it perfectly! I rarely cry in movies but this one made me shed a tear, it was funny and sad and the actors were absolutely brilliant! It seems like critics just gave this bad reviews because ""it wasn't based on a true story (Since those are the only movies that actually get good reviews)"" or because they saw a masterpiece and didn't want to admit how good it was (because you know critics). Half the cinema was crying at the end, it was so emotional and it had different twists and turns (especially at the end *wink* *wink*). I give this a 10/10 and a must see masterpiece!"
" It was great! As a comedy.
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,1,"I am saddened and concerned that humanity could be tricked into liking this movie. If I was someone who actually experienced the death of my child, I would have been outraged while watching this idiocracy of a film. The contrived bits of ""insight"" were of less value than something that would come out of the mouth of a five year old. The title of the movie was thrown in with no purpose or sense to it. The twists and turns were apparent from a mile away.ALSO, PLEASE. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. DOES ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THAT THE ENTIRE MOVIE IS A GIANT PLOTHOLE?If at the end of the whole thing, the actors playing death love and time are indeed abstract and invisible to most people, than what was the point of that entire plot to get Will fired? The private investigator didn't think these people were crazy too? What about the guy they hired to digitally remove them from the footage? (Which also wouldn't have even been possible from the angles the P.I. was shooting from) I'm sure he would've loved to reconstruct the entirety of Will Smith's body, except of course for the fact that there was nobody there in the first place. Imaging Kate saying ""oh yeah, riiiight there. That woman in the blue dress. Oh. There's ACTUALLY NOBODY THERE? INTERESTING!"" Such a cheap sell. All of this movie. Bad. Bad bad bad. I am so sad that people found some sort of message in this pile of dung. I could continue to go on about all the issues in this movie. But I will leave it at this. Please people, I am begging you, don't hold the bar so low. We can encourage some amazing, moving, beautiful, emotionally intoxicating films. They do exist. This is not one of them. Look up Neil Breen if you want to watch a movie of this caliber that's actually enjoyable."
" Loved this movie
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"I'm glad I didn't see the critics' reviews before deciding to see Collateral Beauty. It was a ""10"" experience for me and I wouldn't have responded to it the way that I did if this movie was anything like the way the critics describe it. Yes, the topics addressed - the loss of a child, the inevitability of death, the regret of a life wasted chasing what doesn't satisfy - are portrayed in a deeply emotional way. But it felt honest to me and it was cathartic. And I wouldn't be surprised if Will Smith gets an Academy Award for his performance. So take a chance. Ignore the critics. Prove them wrong. I'm glad that Hollywood is making movies like these again."
" Beautiful, smart and touching.
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,10,"I could never t have asked for a better film to watch on New Year's Eve. Have never really watched a proper film like this before because I am 11; but this one hit me hard in the feels. I went with my dad, who I have never seen cry before, but he did with this movie. Will Smith is a brilliant actor, and he portrays Howard impeccably. The pain that the character of Howard would have been feeling really shows in this film. Although the film is based around Howard losing his daughter, if you have ever lost anyone you will relate to his pain. Beautiful story line and honestly the best film that I have ever watched. Ten stars, do not understand why there are such horrible reviews. You will cry, but it is worth it."
" Warner Bros. warns America of the dangers of . . .
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,9,". . . Snail Mail in this tragic story of COLLATERAL BEAUTY. Warner documents how it may take as little as $800 to cut a master key to all the blue metal U.S. Postal Service sidewalk drop boxes in New York City, so that your business colleagues or rivals can joke about your personal correspondence--or, worse yet--use the privileged information contained therein to wreak havoc with your personal life and destroy the firm for which you've slaved your entire working career. Will Smith runs the full gamut of Human Emotions from Sad to Weepy as the main victim of COLLATERAL BEAUTY's mail fraud scam, so it's likely that Will's Real Life Wife Jada will get Sad Will a Best Actor Oscar Nom, as well as garnering Weepy Will a Best Supporting Actor Nod. Though Warner Bros. may not win the Golden Statuette for Best Movie with COLLATERAL BEAUTY, it will be a crying shame if it doesn't at least pick up the Gelded Little Man for Best Documentary Feature by virtue of its exposing how vulnerable the USPS sidewalk Blue Box users really are."
" Beautiful Story
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,10,"The trailers for this movie had me intrigued to say the least. Writing to Death, Time, and Love and getting an in person response?! And what is collateral beauty after all? Never heard of it. Collateral damage, yes, but collateral beauty..? Still can't say for sure, but, it packs a helluva punch.The premise has tear jerker written all over it, however, the setup for the movie was still surprising. Things aren't as clear cut, black and white as they first seem. The surprises, twists and turn, (especially the last one) are artfully done and take this movie to a higher level, leaving you with a lot to think about.Also surprising, much like life itself, especially during hard times are the moments of humor. Perfectly timed, executed, and organic.The all star cast is unbelievable. The incomparable Helen Mirren, flawless. Kate Winslet emotional and compassionate. Edward Norton human and flawed. Michael Pena quality all the way. Keira Knightly funny, sweet, pained and beautiful. Relative newcomer Jacob Latimore is fierce in his portrayal and he delivers quite the slap in the face wake up call. This kid is someone to keep an eye on.Finally, Will Smith... Damn. This is a tour de force performance that reminds me just what an amazing actor Smith has become. Quiet, subtle, pained, raw, emotional, vulnerable. The first fifteen to twenty minutes of the film, Smith doesn't even speak, but you see and feel every bit of the hurt and turmoil his character is going through. I'm not gonna lie, every time he was on screen I had to fight back tears just looking at his eyes. It's simply heartbreaking and devastating. Once he does began to speak/engage the power of his performance became undeniable.If you want to great writing/acting and a film that will make you think and feel this is the movie to see. Grab yourself a box of Puffs, you'll need them, and check out this 10 tissue beauty."
" loved this movie
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"i've read the critics but they all seem to disagree with the people i've talked to - ALL of them! it was a slow moving movie (fitting for the subject) but that doesn't mean bad - to me. The mood of the movie was almost quiet, a departed change from most maybe that's why critics slammed it so. I most appreciated it was A very original story, dealing with everyday life. well cast while I thought Kate Winslet could have been so much more. I especially enjoyed the ending, I almost always know endings and did not see this one coming. maybe because i was wrapped up in the previous scenes to give it any thought - my new Christmas fave. a new ""It's a Wonderful Life"""
" Will Smith wants to get serious
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,5,"It has been said that the producers originally wanted ""Collateral Beauty"" to join this year's end's awards race but ultimately decided against it. Looking at the big names starring here – Will Smith, Helen Mirren, Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Michael Peña, Keira Knightley, Naomie Harris – one just has to ask: how bad can it be? To avoid the awards race, I mean. At least it's still released in December, as an antidote to much more popular sci-fi actioneer ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"".Well, let's look at it this way. The movie has enough going on for it to catch attention. Really cool cast, intriguing trailers showing Will Smith talking to abstact supernatural beings such as Death, Time and Love... I also liked the ending although if it does not evolve from the previous plot naturally. And when have you ever seen lots of domino bricks toppling on each other without being at least a little bit impressed? They have quite a few of those scenes, right from the beginning.The only troubling note I could foresee is the duration of the movie, which is a measly 97 minutes. Since when any self-respecting glamorous Hollywood project of modern times has been satisfied with less than two hours, or something close to it?And then it happens. Many of the watchers will probably notice soon that they are not not actually enjoying themselves much. For all the ambitions to offer a poignant story about loss, pain and being humane to each other, the result is just... not there. It's too sappy and bland, characters feel like vague shapes than real human beings and the whole plot can be called pretty manipulative.There's actually two kinds of people who I can imagine actively enjoying this: (1) the ones who have not seen a lot of American movies but quite like them, (2) little girls of all ages or sexes. To put it more bluntly: ""Collateral Beauty"" is for this sweet little girl in all of us. I am talking about this joyous abstract being who can still believe that acting nice makes one essentially a good person, no matter the actual deeds, and always pays off in the end. After all, it's, of course, a suitable direction for what is essentially a Christmas movie disguised as ""Will Smith getting serious project"".Speaking of the handsome devil, this role is very suitable for where the leading man Will Smith currently is with his movie making career. Just as his character has lost all passion for all the seemingly sunny and successful life that has come before, I don't actually remember seeing Smith in a movie and thinking that he must be satisfied with acting for quite some time. Maybe he's really enjoying himself in ""Suicide Squad"", haven't seen that one yet.To some degree, it certainly hurts ""Collateral Beauty"" that Will Smith has always been more of a strong performer than notable actor, even given better material. He's always been adequate and he will not sink the ship here, but he's just... not that good.I guess it helps a little that Smith uses little bodily movements and tics to convey the overwhelming emotional pain buried inside the character. But he's far from having a convincing, effortless dramatic role presence as some of his colleagues here, mostly Harris, Peña and the ever-great Mirren.Maybe it's just me... but I have noticed that sometimes movie makers use this trick to compensate for the mediocre performance of the star. They give him as little dialogue as possible and let him just lurk around, so the screen colleagues and overall atmosphere can make him look better. Remember, say, Eminem in ""8 Mile""? This seems to be also the case here but sadly the material is not as interesting to really make it work.""Collateral Beauty"" doesn't offer much in the way of authentic emotions, nor exciting roles from talented cast included here. But as just a Christmas movie for a little girl in all of us, it's quite OK. It looks certainly pretty, which can be confused with good sometimes, when the audience is feeling generous.By the way, Will Smith is appearing next in ""Bright"", some Netflix- produced fantasy that is still mostly held under wraps. The plus here is magnificent director David Ayer known for achieving frightening authenticity with his actors, as in ""Harsh Times"" or ""End of Watch"". I really liked ""Fury"", too. So if there's someone who can give Smith his mojo back, maybe it's Ayer.And if even this will not work out, ""Bad Boys"" 3 ja 4 seem to be on schedule for 2018 and 2019, repectively. Surely Smith can do good with the series that made him a proper movie star?"
" Highly recommended beautiful little movie
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Enjoyed this film so much I signed up to IMDb just to review it......The film tells the story of four colleagues/friends, Howard (Will Smith), Whit (the ever reliable Ed Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet) and Simon (Michael Pena). The film pivots around how Howard deals with (or rather doesn't deal with) the death of his six year old daughter and the impact it has on the other three. I don't want to give away too much but an unusual (slightly implausible) scenario results in Howard meeting Love, Death and Time who end up imparting some wisdom not just to him but also to his three friends. Whilst there are undoubtedly sad moments, I found the film to be touching, thought provoking, entertaining, amusing and very unique. Ultimately this is a the film about life and death and the beauty of existence, delivered in a somewhat ""Hollywoodesque"" manner. So yes at times there is an air of cheesiness but it still manages to be heart warming without being over the top. I didn't mind the ""Hollywood"" feel as personally I find some arty films can veer towards being slow, self indulgent and pretentious, which this is not (maybe that's why the critics didn't like it?)The acting is top notch - all the main cast are excellent and Helen Mirren is scene stealing yet again.Overall I found this to be a charming little movie which made me leave the cinema thinking about the wonder of life, and isn't that what art is supposed to be about ????So if you like films like It's a Wonderful Life or The Family man ignore the critics, go see this film, I'm glad I did"
" Love and Loss and Love
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"Well, I'll respectfully disagree with some of the reviewers out there that gave this movie a lackluster review. I found it to be thoughtful, well written, well directed, well acted and quite a nice story. If you go, and I hope you do, you may want to bring the tissues...Will Smith does a good job; but, the film is really carried by the supporting cast; especially Helen Mirren, Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Michael Pena, and Keira Knightly. They are all quite marvelous in their roles.David Frankel directed and did an wonderful job looping the story together and tying up all the story lines together at the end.Quite enjoyable and, remember, bring the tissues..."
" After losing his daughter, Howard is in desperate need to get his life back together in order to save his company.
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,"I love films that make you read between the lines...films that are more than a movie and are so impacting that they affect you to your core. That's this film.Despite Will Smith being the most prominent person on the poster, the film does not revolve around him. It's a story describing how everything connects along with, of course, collateral beauty.In this emotional film by Frankel, you are sure to find one character or another that you can relate to as an audience member. Perhaps this is why it is so riveting and engaging. Plus this film keeps you guessing about Helen Mirren's, Kiera Knightly's, and Jacob Latimore's characters of Death, Love, and Time respectively.Films that make you feel, think, and leave you with a new found experience and/or knowledge are my favorites and therefore this is my new favorite film. To me, it is the best film of 2016. True, it doesn't have many special effects or flashy scenery nor amazing camera work, but the script and acting makes up for all of it. It's a feel good, tear jerker, amazing film and if you had to see any film in theaters right now, I would strongly recommend this one to start off the new year."
" Great characters, implausible premise.
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"I'm ready to see any film starring Will Smith and some of his co-stars. This was a nice drama, although its premise was a hard sell.For someone to be that grief-riven after two years as to totally disregard the welfare of everyone around him seemed like a stretch. Smith does a nice job, complemented by the tragic parallel story lines of his key co-workers. Still, it was hard to imagine such emotion after such a stretch of time, given the tremendous strength of the main character.Truly enjoyed the outstanding cast of perennial favorite actors and actresses. Worth seeing, with a satisfyingly ""surprise"" ending. Still, much more could have been done with such a wealth of acting talent."
" Critics got it wrong
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"Reading through the professional critics reviews of this film, I wonder if they really watched the movie or just riffed off of each other because their shallow observations are so similar. This is not action hero Will Smith.....this is a man who lost his little girl and the happy, charismatic character in the beginning is the contrast before the fall. Were his partners being deceitful in an attempt to pull Smith's character back from the brink, as suggested by the critics, or were they the unwitting accomplices of their correlates, Love, Time, and Death - the mantra of their business. Einstein explained relativity saying, ""Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute"". This movie falls in the second category. My wife and I were so engrossed in the film that that the 90 and a couple minutes run time flew by and the ending......you just don't see it coming and it smacks you.We loved the movie and would watch it again in a minute. You should give it your time."
