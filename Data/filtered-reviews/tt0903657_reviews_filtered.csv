" Casting cock up
",2021-04-05 00:00:00,2,"Love the Beach Boys so thought I'd give this a try. Started in a corny fashion with the old style BB from the early 60s Seen these scenes a thousand times. Doh.But the worst was yet to come. The enigmatic and good looking lad that was/is Brian Wilson was to be played in his middle/later years by John Cusack!! Was Stevie Wonder on the casting crew for this film. How can anyone accept the weasely looking B movie star Cusack as the great man Brian Wilson. I would suggest very few, and no real Beach Boys fan, never. I checked out very soon after his curtain call. Spoilt what could have been a decent interpretation of a confused soul."
" And I don't like music biopics....
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,8,"Love and Mercy. What I knew about the beach boys..... I could probably reel off a few overplayed hits and think they were the cool boy band of the 60s. And that's it. What I knew about the creative genius of the beach boys, Brian Wilson, was pretty much nothing. And as a rule I'm not a fan of music biopics. So it's fair to say that, despite the ubiquitous positive reviews, I've never wanted to watch Love and Mercy. That's until I watched the Kermode doc secrets of cinema - the pop movie episode - and it grabbed my attention. And the result was as brilliant as it was unexpected. That Wilson was played by two actors - young and middle aged - worked far better than if a young actor had been heavily made up and/or with CGI as you often see (The Irishman anyone?) Love and Mercy made me care about Brian Wilson - I didn't even know what happened to him. So when I find at the end that that he'd released an album in 2004 called ðŸ˜Š - HIS work, I cried with a mix of happy sad (watch Sing Steet - that's happy sad!). I'm buying the album right now. The name Brian Wilson didn't mean much to me. It does now. 8.5 out of ten. Wonderful."
" Half way through and it's a no
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,4,"Dani and cusak as Brian Wilson? Errr very weird choice and an equally weird movie
I the boys playing the beach boys were not the right image, the real beach boys weren't this clean cut and look a bit stupid
Sorry"
" Haunting and moving
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,10,"What a haunting and moving film.The Beach Boys are part of my musical backdrop and evoke memories, but they were not really my cup of tea: their early work was too Americana for me ad so I dismissed them.Did not really know about any of the Brian Wilson history. I came to this film because Paul Dano was in it, with the bonus of John Cusack.I have to say that Paul Dano always brings this extra special quality to any performance and it worked like magic in this film.I was completely drawn in and felt like I was standing in Brian Wilson's shoes.It was heart breaking.The music now has my full appreciation and yes Brian Wilson is a genius; comes across as such a nice, simple and humble man to boot."
" Love & Mercy
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,8,"Directed By ""Bill Pohlad"" known for ""12 years A Slave"", ""Into the Wild"" & ""Brokeback Mountain"". I only just seen ""Love And Mercy"" Very recently and I was shocked I hadn't seen it before or heard about it. It's a biopic about ""The Beach Boys"" from the 60s up until the late 80s/early 90s, focusing on the life of ""Brian Wilson"" played by ""Paul Dano"" as the younger version and ""John Cusack"" in his later years. While these two actors don't resemble each other at all, it's one of them movies that break the traditional mold movie makers go for and I think it works well as the two portrayals are from different points in his life. The story alternates between these two timelines seamlessly which makes for a surreal experience. There's some dark scenes that really delves into ""Brian's"" personal life and the fragility of his mental state after the bands initial success, these scenes feel very down to earth and the moments where ""Brian"" is working on his compositions are very realistic too, almost like you've been transported back in time. The creative process of that is shown unlike most band biopics which can come across quite cheesey. This film is emotionally gripping and deserves more praise. Even if you aren't a fan of ""The Beach Boys"" it's worth a watch for the performances and the vision of ""Bill Pohlad""."
" The Best Musician Biopic I've Ever Seen
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,9,This film is wonderful. Pet Sounds is one of my favorite albums and the way the film takes the time to show the making of the album along with Brian's state of mind throughout its creation and the creation of future projects is amazing to watch. These are paired with the heartbreaking segments of future Brian and his struggles with his mental health and with these parts combined you get something that portrays Brian's life beautifully and honestly and gives a real insight into his mind and the mind of a musician who is really struggling mentally and how this can affect their music.
" Great Bio of the Beach Boys particularly Brian Wilson
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,10,"Fantastic movie! Brian Wilson was so talented and John Cusack does an amazing job embodying his character. The direction is great. The characters are perfect. You will learn a lot about Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys and learn to be empathetic toward Brian. Very inspiring, yet also sad. Acting and direction are great and of course you will love hearing the music!"
" Paul Dano gives a truly stunning portrayal of young Brian Wilson
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,9,"Dano brilliantly portrays the emotionally tormented Brian Wilson in an amazing performance. Brian Wilson is a prodigy if not a musical genius, and he was the songwriter behind the multi-million selling records of the Beach Boys, one of the hottest pop/rock groups of the 1960's. But Wilson's seemingly God-given talent was not without cost: he was tormented not only by his abusive father (Murray Wilson), who drove his sons (Brian, Carl, and Dennis) relentlessly to succeed; but also by a psychological condition diagnosed as ""schizoaffective disorder"" plus manic depression. The disorder causes Wilson to experience delusions, hallucinations, and impaired life function, and still troubles him today (the movie was made with his input) and he was dealing with all of this while an active member of the Beach Boys... his songwriting duties, combined with the expectation that he perform on stage with the rest of the group as well, created enormous pressure on him and contributed to several mental breakdowns. This led the Beach Boys to hire the Svengali-like psychiatrist, the sinister Eugene Landy (in a great portrayal by Paul Giamatti) who then proceeded to run Brian's life for the next few years.The first part of the movie has Paul Dano portraying Brian, while the second part has John Cusack playing the same person. I don't know why the film makers felt they needed to use two actors to portray Brian Wilson - the actor switch is odd, unsettling and totally unnecessary. The first part of the movie convinced me that Dano alone would have been perfectly capable of portraying ""old Brian"" too, and I have to wonder why they chose to tell the story this way. It doesn't ruin the movie, for me at least, but it does detract from the drama and conflict inherent in the story, which the film has loads of: Conflict between Brian and his band mates, particularly Mike Love (the lead singer and also another family member). Conflict between Brian and Landey, who has made Brian into his puppet. Conflict between Brian's girl Melinda (Elizabeth Banks) and Landy, with Melinda realizing the hold Landey has on Brian is unnatural and wrong. The way these get resolved is the most interesting parts of the film, with the battle for Brian's soul between Melinda and the manipulative Dr Landy being the best.You don't have to be a Beach Boys fan to like this movie, although it doesn't hurt."
" A Supremely Fascinating Film. One of the Very Best Of Its Kind.
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,10,"The Beach Boys is one of my very favourite bands ever. I could listen to them all day long. So I was thrilled when I saw a new big-budgeted theatrical film based on its leader was coming out. I was in awe from start to finish with this. This has got to be one of the two or three best music biopics in film history. Even if I wasn't a lifelong fan of the band, my opinion on the film would be the same. I have waited so long to review this because a review needs to do the film justice.""Love & Mercy"" is a psychological character study of Brian Wilson. As a deep character study, we are immersed deep into the mind of the musical genius. Paul Dano plays Brian Wilson during the peak of the band in the mid-1960s. Having had a nervous breakdown and jealous over The Beatles' release at the masterful ""Rubber Soul,"" Brian takes time off touring to focus on making the best album in music history. A departure from traditional Beach Boys tunes, Brian makes what many consider one of the best albums ever recorded: ""Pet Sounds."" Cousin Mike Love hated the album because he knew the departure from their signature sound would result in plummeting sales. Despite critical acclaim, Love was right. Love also persuaded Wilson redo ""Pet Sounds'"" followup (SMiLE) to a more familiar sound.
Seeing the musical and mental process into the making of such greatness is out of this world. We watch in amazement as Paul Dano re-enacts Brian Wilson's essence. We feel horrible when Brian clashes with Mike and gets belittled by his father.In the mid-1980s older Brian (now played by John Cusack) meets car salesperson, Melinda (Elizabeth Banks). This is also the part where we get to know more about Brian's childhood. His father was very physically and emotionally abusive. Since Brian was the oldest of the three brothers, he got it the worst. He tells Melinda that his father beat him so hard that he is now hard of hearing in one ear.Melinda finds out that Brian has been under the spell of crooked psychotherapist, Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti). Despite Giamatti not looking at all like the real Landy, his performance was so dead-on that it genuinely scared the real Brian at the screening. Eugene Landy was a corrupt doctor who kept Brian inside a bubble. Landy got Brian on a ton of different medications that worsened his mental and physical health than what it was before. Melinda is determined to get Brian out from under Landy.Dano and Cusack never met and took totally different approaches to playing Brian. Despite the time gap being twenty years, we still see where one guy ends and another begins. They are both Oscar-worthy. Well, so are Banks and Giamatti. When all the leads deliver Oscar-worthy performances that are spot-on their real counterparts, you know you've got excellence.Most of the best films ever dive deep into the minds of their characters; developing them so well, we feel like we've known them our whole lives. Not only do we get that, our subject happens to be a musical genius that we fall in love with. Seeing him on fire composing will make you say wow.Aside from a deep, personal story of Brian Wilson, this is also a tiny bit of a love letter to surf country. The glistening sunlight and lovely waves are beyond enchanting to look at. It may be one small aspect, but it shouldn't go unnoticed.This extremely well-detailed and shockingly accurate biopic needs to be seen by all, whether you like the Beach Boys or not.4/4 (Four stars aren't enough for this.)"
" Today's Brian more interesting than yesterday's
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,7,"I was much more engrossed by the performance by John Cusack, playing the aging rock star, anxious and terribly needy. Unfortunately for Brian, he was needy for the attentions of a charlatan who mulcted him for millions. It was pathetic to see him trying to establish a relationship with a woman under the basilisk stare of a quack doctor. Cusack, Banks and Giamatti are all superb in these scenes. I found myself responding less to the young Brian, played with some commitment by Paul Dano, a visionary with a vision that was going nowhere. Jimi Hendrix made a crushing remark about the conversion of the Beach Boys to the avant-garde: they sound like a psychedelic barbershop quartet."
" I'M TOO BLACK AND CONSERVATIVE FOR THIS MOVIE
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,1,"Succinctly. Too much john cusack and not enough Beach Boy music.
I useto like cusack...but that was before the era of Trump. Now he's vomit to me. I really wanted to like the movie because I find the Beach Boys sound very unique and entertaining. And it sounds really good. But there was very little of it and I couldn't get into the Brian Wilson character (Which is a must for a movie of this type)...because I just kept seeing cusack-on-qualudes.
The kicker was when I remembered I was black, and that made it easier to divest myself of the whole affair. I reached for the Temptations biopic instead. But honestly, I did wanna enjoy it...but couldn't Hollywood actors in the Age of Trump make me hostile. Screw 'em. Sorry Beach Boys."
" The voices we hear
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,9,"What worked:
screenplay and storytelling; the movie tells us the story of once a popular figure who is dealing with mental illness. The story is moving, heartbreaking and makes us love his life through this wonderful movie.What did not work:
-plot holes; while we see the journey of the star, we would have wanted to see the downhill journey and how he got where he is, I mean there is some narrative missing between the past and future him.
Final verdict: recommended"
" One of the best Biopic movies I've ever seen
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,8,"Why didnt Paul Dano play Brian throughout the entire movie?
Starts out really strong. A lot better than I expected. I'd been putting off watching this and now I'm glad I've finally seen it."
" Another by-the-numbers music biopic
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,6,"I've been a fan of The Beach Boys music for a long time, and even though I'm not typically a huge fan of biopics, I expected my love of the music to make Love & Mercy a winner for me. Yet I felt like this wasn't a film that cared about the music as much as the man. We are shown Brian Wilson working on a few of the more complex songs, but the film seems to be more focused on exploring his mental issues and how his experimentation with drugs intensified those problems. This means it falls into a lot of the same tropes as other music biopics. I was also a bit surprised how much they limited the roles of the other band members. There are moments when they give their input and argue with Brian, but it never feels like they are major characters in the film. In fact, we hardly ever see them perform a song, we just see the recording process.That's not to say that I was entirely untouched by Love & Mercy. Paul Dano and John Cusack do a good tag-team as Brian and you can see they worked with each other to get some of the mannerisms down. Paul Giamatti is great as the Svengali who takes control of Brian's life, although I wanted to see more of the in-between time so we could understand how Eugene Landy came into the picture. While the film didn't delve as deep into the history of Beach Boys music as I'd like, it certainly did pay respect to the elaborate lengths that they took to create some of their best songs. I'm a sucker for any of the scenes where Brian is struggling to perfectly manufacture the sound that he hears in his head. I only wish that was more of the film. This is frequently the case with biopics, even when I enjoy them, I start to wonder if perhaps a documentary would deliver more of what I want to see. Love & Mercy isn't bad, but I want the rest of the story."
" Beached like a whale - No fan? No good.
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,5,"This was so bad. 25 minutes of my life I'll never get back. I could have been having a lap dance from a incontinent baby rhino. But no. Although, watching Paul Dano's wide range of a singular emotion (pathetic) at full display must feel similar. There's this critic review. Slant Magazine. 38. He's right. Don't watch it unless you're a fan and you don't care about this flat, emotionally manipulative, headachingly predictable story. Fans don't care. They'll love it anyway. That's why they're fans and that's cool. I have the same. Different criteria for quality then."
" Painful
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,5,"A film about genius, pain and exploitation which was painful to watch, felt exploitative and was distinctly lacking in genius"
" Bad casting spoils it
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,4,"Paul Dano is brilliant as the young Brian Wilson, he captured him so well. The other actors playing various Beach boys were also well cast, but then along came John Cusack playing the older Brian Wilson and it was awful, spoiling an otherwise good movie.
There was no reason Paul Dano could not have continued to play the older Brian, movie makeup has come a long way and it could have really worked. Cusack looks nothing like Brian, not even remotely and every time it cut to him the movie lost all credibility. In fact the first time he appeared I had no idea who he was supposed to be.
When you see Brian Wilson himself singing at the end of the movie, it really drives home how badly cast John Cusack was. It is a shame as this could have been a brilliant biopic, but Ray it isn't.
There were some great scenes of early Beach boys, especially the live stage scenes and the making of the album Pet Sounds, and the song ""Good Vibrations,""
Mike Love, Dennis and Carl Wilson, all seemed reasonably well played if a little underused.
Elizabeth Banks played her part brilliantly and out-acted Cusack.
The actor playing Eugene Landy was also badly miss-cast and the scenes surrounding him showed Brian to be a weak almost childish person, not someone with drug and mental health issues.
The best parts of this movie are the recreation of the Beach boys making and performing their classic hits."
" Driven by Strong Language
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,4,"I find strong language interferes with the telling of a story whether true or other. This one, is for the most part, true. I got through about 50 minutes and due to increasing blasphemy and strong language had to hit delete. Given this is one of the greatest song writers and producers this world has ever known the language, which the USA seems to think is necessary to sell a movie, spoiled it. IF you are going to watch - be warned. If you want to know what Brian Wilson really went through, best that you read it!"
" It's wishy, it's washy, it's just like the Beachboys
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,7,"The acting is fairly good all-round it's just that the story line, as the Beachboys themselves, is really winsome. This is a hugely sentimentalised version of what could've been an interesting exploration or mental health in the music industry."
" Passable biopic but not convinced
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,6,"Inclined to agree with most of the other reviews here, that Dano is great as the younger Wilson, Cusack poor (or else just miscast) as the older one. I've never counted myself much of a Beach Boys fan, nevertheless I was interested to learn more about the tortured artist Brian Wilson, and even prepared to believe he was some kind of unrecognised genius. I wasn't persuaded in the end, though what is clear is that he was vastly more creative than his bandmates or siblings, who would cheerfully have kept making bubble gum music forever. He obviously had a lot more to say, but it was never going to work within what was essentially a cheesy medium, surf music. So the movie oscillates between the sublime and the ridiculous - and to that extent is perhaps an accurate portrayal!"
" Banks is money
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,5,"Movie on the Beach Boys. Focus on the genius of Brian Wilson and how he was exploited in the later part of his wife. Overall average, acting subpar I think it focuses too much on Wilson s life. Didn't like the acting except for Elizabeth Banks which I thought was great"
" An Excellent Musical Biopic
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,8,"Brian Wilson deserved this movie. This is the kind of quality film that his musical genius demanded. As a fan of one of the greatest bands on all time, I couldn't have asked for a better tribute.Paul Dano and John Cusack are both great as Brian Wilson. I usually don't think Cusack is anything more than ok, and he actually seems like a drug-addled Brian Wilson. But here though, his demeanor and mannerisms fit the role perfectly. He's actually believable as a washed-up musician close to insanity, and he's complimented very much by Paul Dano, who I think was a perfect casting choice for young Brian Wilson. Paul Giamatti plays his usual role as a horrible turd, but here it's most welcomed, as the person he plays is exactly that, and Eugene Landy is as despicable a person as Giamatti portrays him. Elizabeth Banks is a highlight too, and did a great job as Melinda Ledbetter. I appreciated that she wasn't just a detached love interest for Cusack, but they actually showed Ledbetter intervene in Wilson's life.I don't think the film deviated much from the true story, and it was very believable and engaging. Wilson's drug issues and musical inspiration are well-depicted, and the other Beach Boys are well fleshed-out too. The studio scenes were particularly fascinating, and I could've watched way more of that.I can proudly recommend this as one of the best music-related biographical films out there. This is as soulful and empathetic as true story movies get."
" The Warmth of the Sun.
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,7,"The story of Brian Wilson's breakdown and eventual creative rebirth when liberated from the control of Eugene Landy is well know. This film put a bit of flesh into that story. It works well but only as a TV movie, it's not a big movie by any stretch of the imagination. What works well is the footage of the band and the session musicians.Carol Kaye in her sunglasses is the highlight of the movie gig me. The actors who play the Beach Boys are great too. Love and Mercy the song is beautiful Brian sounds so fragile. I do follow the Brian is a genius path and if films like this keep his music alive it is doing its job. Eugene Landy and Mike Love are particularly unpleasant in the movie, although I think Love as been misrepresented in the Brach Boys story"
" surprise surprise
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,7,"I had heard a rumour that the Beach Boys could not even swim, but it seems that Brian Wilson could"
" Brian Wilson
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,7,This biography film surrounding Dennis Wilson of the Beach boys was disappointing for me. I expected to hear more of his musical genius from early days of the band. But it was an accurate portrayal of the mental struggles of Dennis and his abusive father.

" Good movie, Good music
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Interesting to see the background of such a popular music group. I knew there were issues surrounding Brian Wilson, but I didn't realize the extent of his psychological problems. It's sad to see how his life unfolded in his later years.
I thought the movie was well acted and seemed very true to life in the 60's. Although the Beach Boys were a little before my time, it seems like golden oldies are new again - so most people know their songs."
" Oh Boy. This Is One Aweful Movie.
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,2,"First of all, lest you think otherwise after reading this review, I love the Beach Boys music. Some of their songs are among the finest of all time.Only gets 2 stars because the music scenes in which Beach Boys songs are played are actually pretty enjoyable. Otherwise, we're looking at my first ever 0 star movie.Because I'm old enough to have seen and heard The Beach Boys, having Paul Dano and John Cusack play Brian Wilson is beyond absurd. The movie was so 100% about Brian. It doesn't matter the actors portraying rest of the band were not believable either. Paul Giamatti was a cartoonish fool as the villainous doctor.The back and forth shifting of time of Brian Wilson's life masked the ridiculous poorly acted story playing out on the screen. It made it kid of interesting. And, most importantly, it split the time you had to watch the two leads try in vain to be Brian Wilson. Just when you're about to throw the proverbial brick at the movie screen at Dano/Wilson, here comes Cusack/Wilson just in time to cancel the emotion.The best part of the movie? During the closing credits, the real, thank goodness, Brian Wilson sings the song Love and Mercy. Beautiful.Skip this movie. Listen to the albums Pet Sounds, Surf's Up, or Smile instead. And. you're welcome."
" Could have been great had they not cast Cusack
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,5,"Good and interesting biopic, particularly the flashback/young Brian Wilson scenes, which looked like postcards come to life. Dano was really good and I thought the film did a decent job showing what its like to have a mental disorder where you're 'hear things' and how this is compounded when you're a musician. I could relate! Theres a scene with Dano on a car utterly engrossed in his own mind that really nailed what it's like to experience that--the expression on his face and the sounds of everything outside of your mind being muffled. Really well done.Praises to Giametti's portrayal of Eugene Lundy. You know an actor nails a villain well when you walk away from the film despising the character AND the actor.So why 5 stars? Cause John Cusack had no business being in this movie. He is completely and utterly miscast because he's a one trick pony when it comes to portraying the wounded, the pathetic, and/or the downtrodden particularly when they're mentally ill. The only character he was ever cast in that aligns with his ability to portray these qualities correctly was when was cast as Craig Schwartz in Being John Malkovich. The minute Cusack showed up I was cringing because I knew he was gonna 'Craig' it.I couldn't stop seeing, hearing, or otherwise experiencing the Craig Schwartz character in Cusack's portrayal of Brian Wilson and it really dragged the film down. It was annoyingly distracting and I wish they would have cast someone else. The film might have been an 8 star for me then."
" Even non beach boy fans will find it interesting
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,7,"Often sort of laughed at stories of how Brian Wilson laid in bed, was kind of nuts. But this portrays him as a very sad, but very gifted guy. Newfound appreciation for pet sounds as well. Excellent movie. Drags a bit in the third act, and the flash back/forward/back again takes some getting used to. But I enjoyed it a lot."
" Good, but not perfect
",2019-06-22 00:00:00,7,"Overall, I like the film. It does, unfortunately, have a great number of flat spots, minutes when there's no action or dialogue, which I finally took to fast-forwarding through.
The film does a good job of showing us the deep problems of Brian Wilson, and also his indisputable genius. I now appreciate ""Good Vibrations: more than ever, and I've always liked it.
Side note: Paul Giamatti, a superb character actor, does an excellent job as Eugene Landy, the vile subhuman who had taken over Wilson's life. All through the film I was hoping someone would hit his character with a heavy object."
" The chimera called fame
",2019-05-17 00:00:00,6,"The lifestyles that we used to be so jealous of when we were in our youth, have proved on so many occasions to be unhappy , shallow and tortured.It seems that the gift of so called ""genius"" requires that some other aspect of your existence is taken away... like the ability to live a sane and orderly life.Once you become rich and famous your chance of meeting anybody ""normal"" is similarly taken away from you and you become surrounded by charlatans and opportunists.From that point on, you no longer control your own schedule and it's no wonder that so many pop stars, business execs and artists, develop mental illnesses and can no longer cope with the world.""Genius"" is a very narrow talent and doesn't often spill over into dealing with day to day affairs.So it was (and probably still is) with Brian Wilson, truly gifted but equally messed up in the head. He turned out some fabulous songs, my favourite being ""Good Vibrations"" but he turned out just as much garbage.It's only once you've had a few hit songs that you are allowed the indulgence of top quality professional musicians in your recording sessions and these musicians are the ones who were able to put his ideas into sounds.This is the unbroken thread in all success stories, a gifted but troubled individual who gets a break by way of synchronicity.All the right people come together at just the right time.... and then the aforementioned crepuscular charlatans and opportunists move in and wreck the train.A good movie for one with a pop star as the subject, John Cusack is really good as the older Brian, Paul Dano not as good as Brian the younger (but still OK) and of course Giamatti, as the rogue opportunist, is just superb.There's something missing with Elizabeth Banks' performance but it could be that it's hard to sympathise with a character that goes headlong into a relationship knowing that the partner is not much more than a zombie."
" Missed the important thing
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,3,"This film leaves a depressing feel to the life of Brian Will on. If it's at all viable, his life was a total waste and the lifestyle of his brothers was angelic which was not the case. He twas manipulated by almost every person he came in contact with. The situation with the Beachboys was so complicated that one film cannot cover the Dynamics of it all. I feel that this film does injustice to the facts."
" ""Well it works in my head. It's all playing in my head.""
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,8,"When Brian Wilson was going through his rough patch with mental illness, it wasn't unusual to see or hear comics taking a poke at the musician and having some fun at his expense. Rob Bartlett's impersonation of Wilson on the now defunct Imus in the Morning radio program immediately comes to mind. But seeing what the man went through in this thoughtful biopic, even if just a cursory glance, is revealing in a way that's both introspective and respectful. I never followed the individual personalities in The Beach Boys, but enjoyed their music as much as anyone growing up as a teenager in the Sixties. Knowing a bit more about them today, it was interesting to watch the family dynamic as Brian was attempting to explore different musical stylings while the general consensus was to stick with what made the band famous. In that regard, it was cousin Mike Love's (Jake Abel) influence that seemed to have the most sway, and who was the most vocal in trying to bring Brian back in line with his brothers.The period involving the production of 'Pet Sounds' was particularly apt, as The Beach Boys had this artistic competition with The Beatles over musical supremacy in the country. It was true that Paul McCartney acknowledged 'Pet Sounds' as the best album ever, though that's a rather humbling stance to take when you consider ""Sgt. Pepper', 'Abbey Road', and 'The White Album' in comparison. The one scene that really staggered me was when Brian Wilson played the piano in his own home and it was situated in a sandbox! A sandbox - how much more Beach Boy can you get?The galling part of the story, in as much as Wilson was dealing with his personal demons, was the presence of the scurrilous Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti). One would have to consider how much better the musician might have fared if he had someone working in his best interest instead of pursuing personal selfish motives. Wilson's father (Bill Camp) wasn't much help either; his sale of the Beach Boys music rights was an outright betrayal of the highest order.The only qualm I really have with the movie was the use of two actors to portray Wilson. There appears to have been an aesthetic reason for doing so, as it delineated the two very different aspects of Wilson's musical career before and after his breakdown. However for this viewer it served as a distraction that kept rearing it's head with the chronological shifts in the story. Both Paul Dano and John Cusack were effective in their portrayals, but Dano looked more like the former Beach Boy. Since the way today's techniques of aging a character with makeup are done so effectively, I would have preferred Dano throughout the entire story."
" a bio about brian wilson
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that people at any point can take advantage of someone's mental health issues and use them against them. The direction and screenplay are both really good. The casting and acting are both really good especially by. John Cusack who successfully becomes a middle aged Brian Wilson. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Grip Strength
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,10,"When the music plays, it actually sounds like a well-held-on-grip over brilliantly organized thoughts. It cannot be stressed enough how brilliant Paul Dano gives life into the sum of all thoughts and input to Brian Wilson's character. He brought out the clear contrast of Brian's complexity against those people around him. It cannot be done of course if not for the scary portrayal of Paul Giamatti of Dr. Eugene Landy and the vulnerability from John Cusack. When Paul Giamatti established his presence, it carried over throughout the film like he was some sort of gravity pulling on both the mind of older Brian (John Cusack) and in extension, the audience's. Even when he wasn't there, the bodyguards surrounding Brian almost didn't have their own individuality but only carriers of Giamatti's dictatorship. I'd also like to give credit to Elizabeth Banks's performance because despite the few lines to deliver for a key character, what they lacked in time and depth was given through her connection to John Cusack's. The two of them had chemistry but more than that, their partnership portrayed stability with each other. The direction, screenplay, and editing was also flawless. The film is presented through the knitted episodes of Brian Wilson's life from his youth to the time of his meeting with Melinda Ledbetter and yet, the flow did not seem interrupted. It's simply amazing how the depth of the chaos, the stretch of the struggle, and the rise to recovery were all covered and tackled in the 2 hours of this film. Smooth was the storytelling and more than convincing was the acting. This movie does not disappoint. For similar movies I recommend I Tonya, Walk the Line, and Dallas Buyers Club."
" Great movie
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,8,"This was a really well made movie from start to finish. It wasn't too long and just some solid acting. And OMG Elizabeth Banks??? Holy crap is she good lookingðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. It should be illegal to be that cute!!!
Just sayin'..."
" Good Beach Boys Because of Paul Dano
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,7,"It's time to kick off the summer of reviews! And what better way to do so than with Beach Boys? And so we begin with Love & Mercy, with Paul Dano and John Cusack portraying Brian Wilson in his younger and middle years respectively. I have been a fan of Dano ever since I saw his haunting acting in Prisoners, and he has worked his way up in movies such as 12 Years a Slave. And boy does he shine through here. Not only does he look and act the part, he also sounds the part. And when doing a musical biopic, sounding the part is pretty important and impressive.Now I am a casual Beach Boys fan and really didn't look into their career before this film, but there is really a story to behold. The Dano years of the 60s experiments with LSD and all the typical band stuff from that decade, and it shows the complex mindset of the spontaneous and wonderful mind of Brian Wilson. And you get plenty of good vibrations because you get to listen to a lot of great songs.Go forward a couple of decades to the slightly eccentric Cusack who buys a car from the beautiful Elizabeth Banks who switches up from her usual comedic roles to be a more serious, ""good"" character without too much depth (she's not the focus, but is a driving force and provides romantic connections). Gradually, as she dates the divorced Wilson, she discovers the manipulative therapist Paul Giamatti who has kept Wilson away from all of his family for a solid 2 years at least.These scenes switch back and forth, and it is a solid dynamic to keep the interest fresh for what might be off-putting to some when they hear ""biopic."" You will be engaged and committed, especially if you're like me and are unfamiliar with Wilson's life, but you will also see some missed potential. At just over 2 hours, not all scenes hit the mark and tiptoe through the area marked fluff. There isn't always the intensity wanted in the Cusack scenes, so the powerful moments are toned down just a bit. But, then again, hearing Paul Giamatti yell ""SLUT!"" over and over can't be all bad.Generally speaking, the Dano scenes are better and what I continued to look forward to in the movie. He does the best acting, and watching his methods to find the perfect melodies while his domestic life has its struggles is engrossing and worth the watch. And again, listening to the formulation of the songs is a big treat.There isn't much to boast about directing, but the incredible performance by Dano and the more suppressed and gloomy Cusack are attention-grabbing enough if for some reason Beach Boys wasn't. Ultimately, you'll come away with new appreciation and curiosity about the band that was briefly even more popular than The Beatles, and that is always a success in the mind of a filmmaker."
" LONELY, SCARED, FRIGHTEN
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,10,"The story centers on Brian Wilson (John Cusack/ Paul Dano) and his mental psychosis in two subplots; one in the 1980's and another in the 1960's after the group is famous. Brian had mental problems which seemed to be set around his relationship with his father (Bill Camp) and made worse by drug use. He can't travel and stays at home writing the definitive American album. After the Beatles left the stage and changed rock and roll by going to complex pieces involving studio musicians, Brian wanted to follow. His work while critically acclaimed, never sold as well as his beach music. In the 1980's he meets car saleswoman Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth banks) who recognizes that Gene Landy (Paul Giamatti), Brian's legal guardian, may not have Brian's best care at heart.If you are looking for a Beach Boys story, this isn't it. There are odd scenes which are used to imitate Brian's confused brain. In one scene I thought I was watching the monolith hotel room scene (2001....)Guide: implied sex and nudity. Elizabeth Banks mouths the F-bomb near the end...If my lip reading is correct."
" Otherwise Wonderful
",2018-05-03 00:00:00,8,Fascinating story of Brian Wilson and his mental health issues. Let down by its pacing. Otherwise a wonderful movie.
" Love and Mercy, that is what you and your friends need tonight
",2018-04-09 00:00:00,8,"Knowing little about the Beach Boys music except their well known hits, I did hear about this ""doctor"" who had the lead singer in an isolating grip. Many years Brian Wilson, the lead singer of the popular sixties Beach Boys band, had gone off the rails. Losing it mentally, he was addicted to medicine and was isolated by his ""doctor"" from the outside world. It really is a heartbreaking story. And this movie ""Love and Mercy"" has really made an awesome tribute to the music Brian Wilson made and to the wonderful person he was.""Love and Mercy"" tells 2 stories at the same time. One story about the young Brian Wilson who rose to fame as a musician, and one story about the older, addicted and isolated Brian Wilson, who has gone off the rails. The combination of the 2 stories really mix very fluently. The whole movie is edited in a way a good beach boys song would sound: in total harmony. John Cusack, Paul Dano and Elizabeth Banks all act at the top of their talents.Paul Dano actually seems to sing the songs for real and his resemblance to Brian Wilson is stunning. In the end I am really impressed and in awe of this movie. What a wonderful tribute. Goosebumps all over, because the end is so emotionally uplifting. Special praise for the way the music was remixed, it sounded from another planet so spacious, intense and beautiful. Wow. I would like to add a lot of more comments but in the end it is better to just let yourself get submersed in the music. Dont forget to watch the end credits in which the real Brian Wilson makes an appearance with the song Love and Mercy. ""That is all what you and your friends need tonight..."" as sung by the wonderfully talented Brian Wilson."
" Early parts are good. Then it derrails
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,5,"I enjoyed the early Beach Boys parts of the story and I wished they had been longer. Paul Dano made a great job as the young Brian Wilson and those parts of the movie were very good. I also wished there had been more of their early music and the group beginnings and rise to fame, maybe exploring better the conflict relationship with their father. 
The later parts of the story were not of the same level. John Cusak was a poor casting for the role of the older Brian WIlson. There is nothing likable about his character and it was difficult to see what made his future wife get attracted to him, other than his bank account. It is the victors who write the history books, or in this case they are the ones that will sell the rights to the movie and control how some character, including themselves will be depicted. Maybe I am totally wrong about this, I have no way to know, but the important thing is that this is the way the movie made me feel while watching it, that it was a struggle about who would control Brian Wilson fortunes."
" Did he get the blue Cadillac?
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,3,"I've been very puzzled by this movie. In the end, the central question of whether he got the blue Cadillac he comes to buy at the beginning, and which plays an essential role in the plot, is never elucidated. He never drives it, it's never delivered - actually he doesn't drive anything at all, he has a limo driving him around. So why did he come to buy a car in the first place. Somehow I feel I've seen this movie before, and it was called Rain Man."
" ""I think it's an acquired taste."" .. ""Marriage?"" .. ""Matzah ball soup.""
",2017-12-05 00:00:00,6,"Brian Wilson, the leader/producer/arranger of the popular 1960s group the Beach Boys, stays behind in the US when his brothers and cousin Mike Love tour Japan in order to write songs and lay down instrumental tracks for their next album, ""Pet Sounds"". His busy, creative life, tinged with bitterness over his tumultuous relationship with his father (whom the band had fired as their manager), is juxtaposed with Wilson's life in the '80s as a shattered man inching his way towards a healthier, more normal existence. Vivid, though exposition-heavy shuffling of episodes in Wilson's life and career, with a fussy, somewhat overblown production design in the '60s scenes (where Wilson is played by the impeccably-cast Paul Dano) counterbalanced by a deceptively bland calm in the '80s (with John Cusack portraying the older Brian as a possible paranoid schizophrenic under the thumb of possessive therapist Dr. Eugene Landry). The screenplay by Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner, ""based on the life of Brian Wilson,"" is well-researched if overwritten; every introduction to somebody new on-screen is followed by needless dialogue covering who they are and what they do. Dano could not be better as the younger Wilson, emulating the musician's budding genius and unassuming ego with an introspective, nice-guy personality (until he's pushed, when he becomes defensive though never arrogant). By contrast, Cusack doesn't fare as well. Whether or not Cusack and director Bill Pohlad were aiming for an impersonation here doesn't matter, as the actor's brand of nervous self-doubts and sad regrets have been well-documented on film, making it difficult to accept him in this role; under different circumstances--say, in a roman Ã  clef--Cusack's performance would be solid, but his casting here (perhaps for box office cache) doesn't quite work. The film is a near-miss, but entertaining on the whole, with terrific recreations of Wilson and LA's the Wrecking Crew making musical magic in the recording studio. **1/2 from ****"
" An engaging, focused narrative and great performances definitely make Love and Mercy worth a watch.
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,9,"To all Hollywood directors out there trying to make a biopic of a person's life, this is certainly the way to do it. Bill Pohlad's emotionally engaging biopic of Beach Boys frontman Brian Wilson is extremely effective with great cinematography, wonderful acting by the leads and is heart wrenching well written. Unlike most biopics that tried to cover the entirety of a person's life, Love and Mercy instead keeps its focus on two areas of Brian Wilson's life. First, when the younger Wilson (Paul Dano) is making the iconic Pet Sounds album in the 1960s and dealing with the aftermath of the album's release. Secondly, it deals with an older Wilson's (John Cusack) deteriorating mental state in the 1980s as he attempts to find love with a local car dealer (Elizabeth Banks), whilst also being emotionally abused by his psychiatrist Dr Landy (Paul Giamatti). By doing this, Pohlad creates a more focused narrative that doesn't confuse the audience by trying to cram in too many of Wilson's life into one two-hour movie. The movie also succeeds in the way in which it transitions seamlessly between the two different time periods. Unlike most biopics, it doesn't present the events chronologically. Instead, it goes back and forth between Dano and Cusack's Wilson. However, it never feels like two different movies, as both sections of the film complement each other and add more depth to the scenes that come prior and after. The acting is all around top notch for the film as well. Dano probably gives the best performance of his career, acting like the mad genius that Wilson was. He perfectly depicts the ever worsening mental state of Wilson and it's shameful that he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. Cusack also gives one of his best performance in years. Whilst he doesn't quite have as much to do as Dano does, he still delivers a quiet and reserved performance that reminds audiences of why people so adored him in the 90s. Elizabeth Banks is also great in her role as the emphatic love interest of Wilson. Arguably, some might dislike the fact that Bank's character does probably have a larger role in these sections than Cusack but she never feels forced in. Wilson is seen primarily through Dano's eyes and Banks is the voice of reason that is trying to bring him back to reality. If I had to criticise any performance in the film, I would be inclined to say Paul Giamatti. Whilst his performance is by no means awful, I did think he occasionally went slightly too over the top in some parts of the film. When compared to the subtle performances by all the other main actors, I felt his performance became occasionally too cartoonish (although Wilson himself said that his performance reminded him of the real Dr Landy, so maybe I'm in the wrong on this one). Love and Mercy is a film that everyone should watch, regardless of whether they're a Beach Boys fan or not. It delivers an interesting perspective into one of the 20th century's greatest musicians but feels more focused and more engaging than some of the music biopics that have preceded it (e.g. Ray, Walk the Line etc). It's a film that deserves a gander and I can't recommend it enough."
" Casting Two Different Actors as Wilson Ruined it for Me!
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,8,"Why oh why did they have to cast two completely different looking actors to play Brian Wilson? Talk about struggling with suspension of disbelief. The answer, you might think, is because the film covers several decades of his life. But in fact, Paul Dano is such a fine actor he could have easily pulled off the entire lifespan of this genius. No, I fear the reason is because they needed a ""name"" actor in order to get the film made. Nothing against John Cusack. He's a fine actor as well, and in fact he does a good job, even if he doesn't fit the part. (But then he has a history of taking on roles he doesn't fit as I mentioned in my review of The Raven.) It's such a disappointment that the casting had to ruin this film for me. Because it's a great story and the scenes (with Dano) depicting the creation of Pet Sounds and Good Vibrations in the studio are some of the best I've ever seen in a bio. Paul Giamatti is terrific and scary as the domineering, controlling shrink, something I had only vague ideas about before seeing this film. And Elizabeth Banks is great as well. I struggled with how to rate Love and Mercy because I still think it's a must see film, but I wish they had just let Paul Dano do the whole role. The filmmakers (and Dano) missed out on an Oscar nomination."
" Fame and normalcy simply do not go hand in hand.
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,6,"Fame and normalcy simply do not go hand in hand. According to biopics on the lives of famous music artists, this goes beyond the ability to live a normal life where you can go out without being recognized and where privacy is a virtual impossibility. Beyond this...many have demons in their lives that haunt them. We see this in movies such as ""Ray"" (2004) (Ray Charles biopic), ""Walk the Line"" (2005) (Johnny Cash biopic) and ""What's Love Got to Do With It"" (1993) (Tina Turner biopic). ""Love & Desire"" shows us that even the happy-go-lucky group The Beach Boys were pretty warped. On the surface the Beach Boys are this surf-pop group with fun summer songs, who guest starred on ""Full House"" (1988) in their later years. Little did we know that they had their fair share of turmoil. Control issues, artistic differences and even paranoid schizophrenia did not escape The Beach Boys. Biopics are tricky as far as movies go because the plot consists of the events of a person's life, so a finite beginning, middle and end is tricky to create. This movie did well in artistically capturing the craziness of the lives of The Beach Boys. One negative note in the cinematography is that certain scenes were shot as if someone was spying on the speakers with very shaky camera. It's a technique I'm seeing more and more in films and I can't stand it. Just keep the camera still! Overall, this movie was an interesting look at The Beach Boys, but a rather typical biopic."
" Round, Round get around
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,8,"Yay! The sound of the beach - Round, Round get around - I get around - this movie has all the good vibrations of the 60's till it swirls into Brian Wilson's personal hell............and eventual rescue and recovery.Its a biopic and the timeline is incredibly simplified and compressed compared to what Brian actually went through. The real Brian Wilson plays a cameo role singing the movie theme song in an on screen sidebar during the closing credits - the text of which are probably the most unread credits in any recent movie.Featuring a fascinating recreation of the session musicians ""The Wrecking Crew"" who actually created the sounds of most of the bands of the 60's and early 70's and how they worked.Not a happy go lucky ""surf's up"" movie but an interesting exploration of one aspect of the times."
" Sympathetic re imagined biopic of Brian Wilson
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,7,"When a movie tries so hard to be sympathetic, that view point can come across as forced. In ""Love & Mercy"" director Brian Pohlad fails to bring the story to a higher level of appreciation due to the sensitive nature of doing a bio on a living legend and asking for our love and mercy for Beach Boy madman Brian Wilson. We bask in Paul Dano's Brian - past, an innocent portrayal of the ""Pet Sounds"" era and then suffer through the later years where John Cusaks Brian - future comes across as straight clichÃ© where the actual history is even darker. Must have been tough to swim in that small vector pool of history, obligation and entertainment. The film works best in the music studio showing the relationships, musical commitment and Brian Wilson energy that carried The Beach Boys on his back.For me, that was worth it on those merits, but I'd admit feeling that the later Brian years fell short as did in reality, leaving a bit of a vacuous feeling at the conclusion. I saw Brian perform live with both Paul & John at a benefit in Tysons, Corner, VA for GIVE AN HOUR which was bringing attention to mental disabilities after seeing the movie only months prior and that was a blast!"
" And in my endeavor to watch every movie...
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,9,"...that I missed over an 18-year period, I am in 2014 and have finally seen ""Love & Mercy"" and wishing that I had started from 2016 and gone back because this is one helluva find.I don't do reviews. I don't do reviews because I am an amateur movie-watcher. But when I come across a gem like this I just want to say ""Damn. That was one good movie."" Oh, Elizabeth Banks. I guess that this was the first time that I had ever seen her in anything. I couldn't help but think that I HAD seen her before... but I was thinking of Elisabeth Shue in ""Leaving Las Vegas."" I will be looking at some of her films and TV appearances, now. Banks, Dano and Cusack are just brilliant - but a special nod has to go to Dano: he's the sun and everyone else is a planet - brilliant planets.And that's what I have to say about ""Love & Mercy."" For various reasons I've kept up with Brian Wilson's career as he returned to making astounding music and going from ""Love You"" (""The Beach Boys Love You:?) to ""Brian Wilson."" Is he a music genius? Probably -- If I were to meet him, I wouldn't tell him, though. I've never heard of anyone else write of Wilson as an influence on Steely Dan, but I hear it. I'm an admirer, a fan, and I see this as one of the finest biopics ever made... I know that it was Wilson-approved but I know, too, that the movie depicted Wilson's mental health problems realistically: watch some of the movements that Cusack/Wilson makes with his arms and there are the audio hallucinations, of course.A damned good movie. I'm not sure how I missed it. So glad that I saw it, though."
" The Brian Wilson Story
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,10,"When done right, a biopic film can be quite a sight to behold for the potential it is to combine drama, real-life, and music. Fortunately, ""Love & Mercy"" is most definitely done right, relaying the story of Brian Wilson and his relation to the band he created...The Beach Boys.For a basic plot summary, ""Love & Mercy"" tells an intertwining dual-narrative tale: A young Brian Wilson (Paul Dano) is rising to fame with The Beach Boys, while at the same time succumbing to his mental demons. While the rest of the band wants to ""ride the wave"" (pun intended) of their skyrocketing success, Brian feels artistically compelled (one might say maniacally driven) to do his own thing. An alcoholic and un-supportive father (played by Bill Camp) finally pushes Brian over the edge, prompting him to shack up in his room for years on end. Fast-forward about 30 years into the future and Wilson (John Cusack), now quite an odd fellow but at least out in society again, happens to meet a car saleswoman named Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) and strike up a friendship (that may also be a bit romantic). Melinda discovers that Brian is now closely watched (guarded) by one Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti), on a strict program of pills and tough discipline. The doctor says it is for Brian's own good, but Melinda has her own serious doubts about that.The first thing that needs to be understood about ""Love & Mercy"" is that it isn't a ""Beach Boys biopic"". It's a ""Brian Wilson biopic"". Sure, the other Beach Boys members are prominently featured as is their music throughout, but the narrative focus is squarely on Brian Wilson. So, those looking for a retrospective on the history of the group might be a little disappointed.This is probably a good choice, however, as Brian's story is probably the most interesting thing TO focus on. From his relationships to family, friends, fellow band members, and (in the later years) society as a whole, Brian battled mental illness and extreme anxiety. I hadn't realized that he also looked to be severely taken advantage of by Dr. Landy. Just a fascinating human-interest story all-around.Like all great musical biopics, ""Love & Mercy"" needed great music and got exactly that! You'll be listening to Beach Boys tunes for awhile after the viewing is over. The acting is also very convincing. Both the young/old Wilson actors are spot-on, while Banks shows she can hold down a very serious, emotional role (moving away from the dirty rom-coms and crazy Effie character from the Hunger Games she had come to be known for). Of course, it's a historical picture, so Giamatti is in it (!).About the only caveat I could give to this film is that it might not play quite as well if you know nothing about the Beach Boys or Brian Wilson. I knew the basic story going in, so was able to pick up on all the requisite beats. I'd be interested to hear if others (who know nothing about the topic) were able to do the same.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Love & Mercy"" for its combination of drama, music, and historical realism. The scenes from the past are capable of producing great nostalgia, while those set in Wilson's ""older years"" tell a compelling story that many may not know."
