" Not even trying
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,2,Watching scene where Ari I in Amarillo TX ... didn't realize that there are palm trees in Amarillo!
" funny
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,6,"I've never watched the series but the movie is funny, not enough kid cudi :("
" It's the Gold Standard
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,10,"This movie provided all the goodness of the series. If your a fan, your a fan."
" Enjoyed it more after another viewing years later
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,8,"I loved Entourage the TV show. It had some seasons I didn't love but it was an enjoyable TV show. This is the way the show should have ended and the fi'm gives it an ending that makes sense and is in line with what the show is about. Vincent Chase decides to direct his next movie as Ari is the head of a major film studio. When he goes over budget Ari has to get more money from a oil tycoon to finance the fi'm, which causes problems as they do not enjoy the fim because of the actions of Vincent Chase and his friend. There are tons of cameos in the movie and some pretty funny moments in it. If you liked the show you will enjoy the movie"
" It's ok
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,4,As a huge fan of the show I always looked forward to watching this. It's not all around awful and has some decent laughs. Definitely thought Haley Joel Osment's character kind of ruined it though.
" Fix the ending
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,9,Glad they did the movie which rewrote the ending where the show messed the ending up. People that wrote bad reviews obviously never watched the show before.
" Self-indulgent Dicks
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,1,"Entourage the series had a great storyline, however this movie was a poor attempt at resurrecting the past success of the show. The director couldn't direct, the jokes fell flat and it was a complete waste of time."
" Unwatchable movie
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,1,"Watching this movie was pain for my head. It was even worst when some people in my group laugh whole time. I don""t understud them."
" Encore! Encore!
",2019-10-21 00:00:00,6,"I've never watched the TV show, so came to this movie ... cold, so to speak. It's pretty much a one-joke affair, with nothing greatly original, repetitive party scenes and a fairly predictable storyline. But I have to say that Jeremy Piven's Ari, really does stand out among all the performances. And I really did like all those cameos."
" This movie ain't that bad y'all
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,9,I FINALLY saw this movie and I don't why all the negative reviews. It's probably more a 8 but I'll give it a 9 for arguments sake. If you liked the show I don't get why you wouldn't like this.
" Never heard of the TV Series.. Loved the movie
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,9,"I guess this is my very first review on IMDB, but I thought I must write one about ""Entourage"" shortly after I watched it. It is 2019, and I havent been enjoying watching most of the movies that I've been watching in the recent years. However, I picked this one out of the blues to pass my time and I didn't expect to like it (as usual) .. But man, was I wrong! This movie kept me glued to the story right from the beginning to the very end, and I really wish to find more comedy movies like this.. I highly recommend it 9/10 for the cast, the acting, the story and everything else."
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,7,"Funny and entertaining, pretty disappointing the first time because of over-hyping. It felt more like a long episode than a movie. after expecting that i enjoyed it much more the second time and bumped it a half star to 3.5. They did an amazing job of keeping it true to the show. very fun, and I'm hoping they keep making more ""extended episodes"" which now i know they aren't. sad face. ari and drama are two of the best characters ever.

" I really like the vibe of this film (and TV series)
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,8,"This entire film set in LA evokes a bright vibe within and seeing all of the interaction and dialogue between the characters was masterfully written. Every film begins with the writing and when that's on point everything else shines. The scenery is amazing as well lavish houses, it keeps the audience intrigued, and entertained with plently of laughs in there as well . Definetly a dramedy!"
" The boys are back for one last time
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,7,"Many of us were swept away with the show Entourage, it was different and then soon became very addictive. It was great to see the crew again up to their usual antics.One thing that always impresses me is how they always bring in the big names and celebrities effortlessly. The film was pretty much like a long episode of Entourage, why mess with a great formula. Having said that it resembled some of the okay to good episodes in some of their later seasons. One of those episodes that you quickly watched to get to the next one. Not a great film but a decent one. Interesting how E has become the most 'Hollywood' out of all of them, even more than Vince in this film so good irony. So good to see the boys back in action once more.7.5/10"
" Name-drop-tourage
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,1,"Kudos to all second grade actors that weren't in this movie! It's a male version of ""The Gilmore Girls"" with non-stop chatter about how cool they are, nudity or talk about it, a whole lot of name dropping and singers/athletes appearing a few seconds to ride on the wave of -input voluntary excrement- that Wallberg produced. His appearance with his crew of buffs didn't help either. So, again, thank you, you few who weren't in this poor excuse for a movie. Only question I have is: ""Did any of you appearing in this movie see it more than once?"""
" the characters from the show are back
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,9,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you how powerful a list actors can be when it comes to studios. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this four out of a possible five stars.
" YOU SHOULD SEE WEDNESDAY'S PARTY
",2018-10-30 00:00:00,7,"I have not seen the popular TV series on which the film is based. The characters in the film are not developed, but are provided by a Pierce Morgan interview. Vince (Adrian Grenier) is a successful actor who now wants to direct. Ari (Jeremy Piven) reluctantly agrees which leads to problems as the film budget runs over. I found the film and script to be extremely superficial like a TV series. I would imagine fans of the series will love the film.There were an interesting number of cameos of stars playing themselves which proved entertaining such as Jessica Alba, Kelsey Graham and dozens more. But their brief moments couldn't carry the made for TV script that was sophomoric at times.Guide: F-bomb. Sex. No nudity"
" Love everything about Entourage
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,10,Entourage is my favorite show on earth and this movie was a perfect way to contribute to the end of the series. If you loved the show you will love the movie it is as simple as that. All the same actors and all the same humor that I love. I know that a lot of people will disagree with me but this is one of my favorite movies.
" Bad entourage
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,4,"The story travels a lot but does not go anywhere unusual for the famous. In spite of the beauties, the guys still sounded homer-sexual. Is it possible?"
" It was OK, but probably would have been better to let Season 8 end this series than this movie.
",2018-03-12 00:00:00,7,"I didn't really watch Entourage when it came out but have come to appreciate it as more of a Hollywood parody-comedy since watching reruns and renting the DVDs. The best parts of the movie, as with the TV series, are the writing, banter between the main characters and cameos by the likes of Gary Busey. 
There are some funny and witty lines in it that made me laugh out loud, if you can stand the endless array of adoration by desperate fans - we get it, women like movie stars, no matter how bad the movies are - and predictable plot twists."
" A fun, simple comedy and extension of the series
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"If you haven't seen any of the 'Entourage' TV series (which ran from 2004-2011), then you may occasionally be at a loss during the film. The film starts off with a brief 'where-are-they-now' (on a yacht in the Mediterranean, surrounded by dozens of women, obviously), but doesn't offer much background otherwise, assuming if you're watching it, you already know the four main characters - Vince (Grenier), Eric (Connolly), Turtle (Ferrara) & Drama (Dillon) - plus Ari (Piven), who is almost more essential to the show/film than any of the others.As usual, there's plenty of guest stars - Wahlberg, Alba, Favreau, Neeson, Grammer, Busey, Saget, Spade, Hammer, various NFL players - which sometimes add something to the film, but often seem unnecessary and seem to be there purely to make it feel like Hollywood. There's a minor plot for each of the entourage - Vince directing his first film; Drama hoping for a breakout role in that film (& getting embroiled in some online retribution); Turtle trying to get date a girl who happens to be a professional wrestler; and Eric doing pregnancy things with his currently separated wife. Nothing revolutionary plot-wise and - besides Royal Blood at the start, Jane's Addiction at the titles and Tame Impala in the middle - there's some very average music throughout.Ari is slightly calmer and - even though he still screams and says mean things - he comes off as more charming and less abrasive than before. Great to see Piven & Thornton acting together - arguably to only two 'real' actors/stars in the film! Also, credit to Haley Joel Osment, who plays entitled, ignorant hick superbly. The main issue most people will have with this film is its portrayal of Los Angeles - young/skinny women in bikinis (or not), always a party, always sunny, always a brunch. Possibly true, but it does often feel plastic/forced. However, the film isn't bad - it just feels like three episodes rolled into one, with no real sense of tension or resolution at all. It's just a comfortable ride with familiar faces."
" Highly Disappointed!
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,1,"Really liked the HBO series. This is not the series in its purest form. This was Sharknado on steroids, but Sharknado is actually better. Cameos, Cameos, Cameos. The five main characters from the series are just flat out cheesy in the movie. I will always like the show, but I will do my best to erase that two hours of my life from my brain."
" entertainment
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,9,"i watch a lot of movies but didn't recognize a single face in this film ( well , apart from all those cameos that is ) so i did not have much expectations from the movie , a movie without any big star in the lead roles but i was pleasantly surprised . this movie was super funny , constantly . very well written script and dialogues , appropriate acting , a lot of cameos of well recognized faces ."
" Aimed for fans of the show
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,7,"Entourage (2015) is the highly anticipated movie from the cult hit HBO show. This film feels as if it picks up along right where the season finale of it's last episode ended. This film very much so feels like an extended length version of it's show (that can be a good or bad thing). With everything happening, the film is quite entertaining though we feel it could have been better, but not sure what they could have improved upon. There is most definitely a lot of celebrity cameos that some make very brief appearances where as some offer more of small roles within the film.The comedy and humor is typical as the same of its episodes, some are clever while other jokes miss. This film doesn't try expanding to a new audience as it knows its audience. For those who are not familiar with the show, may be confused at some of the characters, since many of the brief supporting characters are not fully introduced and are simply brought in how the series follows.As a rewatch 06/07/20' the film remains an entertaining watch. There are many subplots to keep us engage, as does the major plot. In the end it somewhat felt a little rushed but it is understandable. It is quite a shame this film wasn't a box office success, meaning there wasn't going to be a sequel."
" Good Production But Should Be Watch After TV-Show
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,8,Entourage is a different production as I see as a TV-show which shows us how the world runs in L.A. with Hollywood. It teached me a lot about movie and TV sector and I highly recommend anyone who wants to act or direct stuff to watch this series and the movie. Entourage as a movie is the continue of the TV-Series and it highly satisfied me after watching all the episodes. But for some random guy it may not leave the same effect because of lack of all the experiences in the series. Even thought they explained a few stuff to audience in the scenes with a unusual way compared to series anyone can still feel the lack of all the experience lived in 8 season. My advice is anyone who didn't watch this movie should watch it after watching the series so they can catch the soul of the movie. If I would rate this movie without the series I probably rate it as a 6/10 or 7/10.
