" Gently LOUD
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"A good movie is one that makes you forget how it goes so you want to see it again.
Timeless, simplicity.
Who needs crashing and bashing.
People just mad because it's a film about women speaking about WOMENS ISSUES.
BTS is best crew to hang with."
" A hot mess of mysteries unresolved by the filmmakers
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,2,"I just watched it a second time. The images all looked familiar enough for me to know that I had seen it, but I could not remember what it was about, so I thought perhaps i had dozed off the first time through. This time I stayed awake, and now realize it's because the film is full of red herrings that lead nowhere and provoke questions never answered. Did she start going blind again b/c her insecure husband messed with her eye-drops? We're led to think so, but then run into a wall. What was the deal with the letter supposedly from the guy who knocked her up? When just a few minutes earlier we see he'd moved away and she had no way of reaching him? Did she write it? Or did some key element end up on the cutting floor? In short, the ending is an incomprehensible mess, which explains why I couldn't remember just what it was about. Apparently, the writers and director never decided, or figured it out either. i hate it when half-baked scripts like this get green it. Producers ought to read them."
" Watch this carefully with mindfulness and you will Love it.
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,8,"Brilliant work!But sadly, such an underrated movie. For those who have already watched or will watch this movie, you will get the story of this movie in the last few minutes and literally in words:1. By the words of the letter which will portray the husband who always loved his wife but only by his own terms, not understanding her terms when she demanded it. Rather he became lost in his insecurity, fear of losing her and committed a terrible sin which he realized late and for what he couldn't forgive himself till his death.2. By the words of the song that the wife wrote and sang at the event. There she revealed to her husband that she knew about the terrible work of her husband, yet she did not leave him, rather forgave him. She told that he could see her love only if he looked for it, hoped that everything could be alright because in all that she liked and loved to do, in her words she said to him, ""All I see is You.""Anyone confused by the scene where she removes the ring and decided to end the marriage, please be mindful that when she wrote that song she did not know about her husband's terrible deceptions. Watch carefully the sequence of events when you see this movie."
" Well directed and acted with some best moments captured between the main pair.
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,8,One of the best movies depicting the disaster that marriage can be. Jason Clarke as the insecure husband is what we see in day to day lives. Blake lively is superb letting her expression convey us the feelings of visually challenged person. The way the scenes where she starts to see the world is interesting. Also a special mention to the editor who has edited the movie beautifully to say the least.
" Brilliant
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,9,"What a brilliant story! You get to experience the actresses deepest feelings. Those only she can show you the watcher. One feel the moods changing - despair, hope, joy, disbelief, pain,loss and life after all. The story is told with subtle changes and if you don't give your full attention you'll miss them. Pour a glass of wine, sit back and enjoy."
" Really depressingly boring
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,2,"No story to this movie whatsoever .And if you have problems with your eyes ,watching this won't help .
Having the blind ladies account ,of being out of focus all the way through the film is just OTT"
" That was probably the worst ending ever
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,4,"The movie was pretty good for a while. Lots of lies, secrets, all that fun stuff. But the ending.... what was that?"
" Keeps you engaged till the end
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,7,"This is one movie that is highly underrated.
Perhaps, the slow paced and seeming lead the viewer to nowhere. The plot thickens only towards the latter part in the movie, by which there isn't much time to leave the viewer guessing on the outcome.
One can draw parallels into several relationships today, compromise vs confrontation."
" Waste of time
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,1,This movie is not recommended..slow uninteresting and waste of time.
" Stylishly filmed & edited, Decent & Quiet Thriller
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,6,"It's not a fast-paced, gripping thriller that will have you glued to the edge of your seat. It is a decent enough unraveling of a suspenseful story involving the slow deterioration of a marriage, which keeps you guessing until the very end. Because there are several ways this can go down, and you keep wondering which way it will be until the last few minutes before the credits roll.It is also shot and edited in a highly stylized manner, trying to make you feel as if you are the blind person undergoing the changes in your vision. I admit those visual moments are far too many in the film, but they do make you feel the suffocation and frustration of Blake Lively's character. I have always loved Blake, no doubt beautiful to watch but also a fabulous, subtle artist.A one time watch that will provide you with reasonable entertainment."
" Don't trust the rating for this one!
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,8,"If you are a cinephile, just watch it (period). I really wanted to say that and nothing else but this form validation criteria is based on the belief that a movies review cannot be summed up in a sentence so I am forced to write that might not exactly be adding value."
" Great movie until the end!!
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,2,The worst ever ending!!!! Helt waste of time!!!!! Could have been a great movie...
" HORRIBLE
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen, nothing makes sense"
" Solid Arty Thriller
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,8,Great acting and great story that will keep you thinking long after the credits have rolled. Nice cinematography too. Go see.
" A story about human weakness and giving in to them and regret.
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,8,"Maybe minor spoilers depending on your point of view, nothing major, no plot points.I liked this movie. It doesn't beat you over the head with the story, but lets it emerge on it's own. It really is about humans and how they disappoint each other and how sometimes you can't forgive and sometimes you shouldn't forgive. It's a parable as well I think, the lesson being that if you really love something you have to accept it when that something outgrows you, and that sucks but it's better than trying to keep something that is no longer a fit.It was well done."
" All I See Is You
",2019-10-15 00:00:00,3,"It's really, really pretentious. The idea is great and it would be really good if it didn't tried to be so artistic with cleary no meaning or depth behind it. I really liked the plot twist, but the ending was terrible, open and confusing. The little song was a great touch. I think it's more of a 6,5."
" Like Blake Lively, but this was just not
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,3,Meandering story about a relationship self destructing. Too much filler and slow.
" Don't waste your time watching this flick
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,4,"I like Blake Lively but I did not like this film. Moreover, the ending was such a disappointment. This could have been an enticing flick but it took a wrong turn at one point in the film which I won't spoil for those who plan on watching it."
" Got A Little Lost...
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,5,"I enjoyed the acting of Lively and Clarke, and mostly thought the direction was well done, but I got stuck on elements of the story a few times. Several plot lines were implied, but were not strong enough to drive the story with confidence. Overall, I enjoyed the film and didn't feel like I wasted my time. I was pretty surprised to learn that this film was a monumental financial flop."
" Really cynical writing
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,3,It all works out for her in a messed up way after they dragged us through her being ungrateful and not honest as soon as she got her vision back but still managed to make him the bad guy in the writing. Great acting though
" I feel dirty watching
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,5,There's a broken and dirty voyeuristic atmosphere in this film that I do not enjoy.
" Stirring, emotionally and intellectually evocative
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,9,"I was unsure of Blake Lively's range Of emotion or depth of character development. I think she breathed life into this character. I was questioning many situations she found herself in ways I don't often get a chance to. The writing and performances were spectacular. More importantly, the artistic filmography was otherworldly and almost ethereal."
" Wonderful Site Locations
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,8,"I'm still trying to figure out where they filmed the scene of them kayaking below cliffs in Spain. Also, where is the cliff-side hotel with glass walls located?"
" All I See is Ew
",2019-09-21 00:00:00,2,"All I see is a film school thesis movie that should have been failed and forgotten. Instead, the director's lust for Blake Lively led to a near pornographic experience that lacks any satisfaction"
" Beautiful
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,8,This movie was pretty great. There were definitely some parts that could have been omitted that didn't add anything to the story line. The ending was a bit anticlimactic but in all it was pretty great. I feel it was a good shift in character types for the two mains. A must see. It's a bit more artistic than what you may initially expect but very much worth the almost 2 hours.
" viva la Marc Forester, multi talented man
",2019-09-10 00:00:00,8,"I understamate the movie at the beginning but to tell the truth it surperise me so much .
the plot was fantasticlly written let rephase that funtastically written the twist and turns was unbelievable .
the camera man super duper catch the moment .
MARC FORESTER done outstanding job writing and directing . real life drama saldom impress me , but with kind of director i'm willing to propose my life story to be finished as he just accomplished.
just saw it i enjoyed it too much thanks Marc, and the cast of i all i see is you .
my cup of tee ...ignor my spelling mistakes , and enjoy the movie .
peace"
" A visually stunning character piece
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,8,Intriguing premise. Beautifully shot and acted. The type of film that haunts you long after you watch. Compelling to watch what should be a miracle instead become a curse for these two characters. Good film!
" The meek shall inherit
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,8,"Good flick that should give one the perspective of being able to care, grow, and love each other over time and adapt to the road ahead for the longhaul. It expressed the weaknesses of both the male & female protagonists equally and if you're open enough to be impartial it may even entertain you. Some unusual and interesting camera work. #pippip"
" Open-mind, right-kinda-mood, curious motivation = Perfect State of Mind for this movie
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,5,"I was curious the whole time. I looked forward to the imagery. The lines and detail were spectacular, I found myself getting caught up in the visual artistry, which tag teamed with the plot, making it possible to finish the movie. There was enough plot to spark my interest, but not enough to keep my interest. Getting distracted so frequently by the visual effects, images, sharp lines, and vivid colors allowed me to forget how I had gotten bored with the story. One reviewer said the story ""has potential"", and I agree! It is a great first draft, it just needs to spend a bit more time finding itself, and then it can take us someplace. I was left standing at a crossroads and could not see in any direction. Considering the subject matter of this movie, and based on my previous sentence, one could think this is incredibly impressive storytelling, if the intent of the author was to make the audience feel how Gina felt = like she was standing at a crossroads and could not see in any direction. If you feel delightfully confused by my review, I suggest you watch the movie. If you feel annoyed by my review, I suggest you skip this one."
" review
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,1,"Abysmal. made me angry. unbearably predictable. awkward and weird with so many parts where i questioned why it's in the movie, and that was never answered. there are some good things here, like music and visuals. has a trippy feel. and lots of intrigue to start the movie. i remember thinking i kinda like this about a third of the way through. but i knew that so little had happened in the plot so far, and the directions the movie could take could easily swing my opinion either way. i was right. they went in a horrible direction. almost nothing happens in this movie. a lot of times with movies that start with intrigue, it never amounts to anything. it just feels kind of pointless at the end. this movie went further. it actually angered me and made me want to stop watching. i finished on fast speed but i already knew basically everything that would happen. focused on forced relationship drama and feelings. was difficult to finish. (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
when i started to realize that this was going to be about how her feelings about her husband change and she cheats on him, i would have never watched this. and also the husband being a piece of crap and trying to blind his wife and gave the dog away. i knew he was going to mess with the medicine the second he looked at it. so lame. so predictable. this movie is for drama fiends. like girls who love soap operas and romantic reality shows. and the weird and awkward sex stuff with the sister and brother-in-law. i mean seriously, in this sex thriller the only nudity is the brother in law's but as he rubs red paint on it after he's done spreading it on a bull sculpture. and then he puts on a dress and goes talks to his wife and blake. yes, it's as weird as it sounds. or what about the scene where blake lively takes a bath with her young nephew. like.. why??? what is the purpose of that. what did it add to the movie or the characters. also, a bird flew into the window and died, blake decides to freeze it, supposedly to collect the feathers like she did as a child............ garbo garbo garbo"
" A movie to think about
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,9,"I am a fan of this kind of movies, when not everything is black and white and when happy ending is not the goal and when it does not prove to be massive and James-Bond-Ocean-full-of-action. It is OK when you don't like such movies too. Actually this is natural. Blockbuster it is not.It is all about relationship and people that can change and can hurt and get hurt. We can't always play by the rules and rule the rules. So this happens to be very painful when we try. Noone knows what is right though everyone understands what is wrong but that doesn't keep us away from acting wrong.The movies is done beautifully, very emotionally delicate.I would say it is a bit sexually center pointed, but it is a part of every ralationship and it is easier. I guess."
" Thoroughly enjoyed!
",2019-06-01 00:00:00,9,"I think the low reviews come from people who enjoy action thrillers with over the top plot twists.
This is a movie about human nature, explored in a very unique way. How would your life change if you went blind then could suddenly see again many years later after moving on with life?
This is not a faced paced film, but instead hooks you in with beautiful details, a constant subtle suspense, and a unique filming point of view. Blake Lively is captivating and says so much with little words.
Completely underrated and unappreciated.
Open you mind, and eyes, and give this film a go."
" 3 questions which I would like answering....
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,2,"1. Why Thailand? When it has no impact on the film at all.2. Why did they continue to film in Thailand but lead us to believe they were in Spain? In fact why did they go to Spain at all???3. Why did the sisters husband paint himself red in front of a devil like figure and put a dress on?I've watched some poor films due to being a firefighter and having some time to waste on night shifts, but I think I'd rather have been called out to a leaking radiator then subject to watching that film..."
" wtf? No no no no...just no.
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,3,"Not really any believable story here, or at least not one any normal person would want to watch. I'll sum it up. Start movie- Nice blind woman and nice man love each other. Woman regains sight. Nice woman turns into bad person. Nice man turns into bad person. Woman does bad things. Man does bad things. They hate each other. Man dies Woman has baby. WHAT TF? WHY TF would I want to watch this mess? It's just another episode of Murry Povich or Jerry Springer, but I guess there are lots of people who like that kind of trash."
" Boring from start to finish
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,1,"This movie is so boring. Nothing exciting happens, at all. You see everything coming - actually you think something MORE exciting will happen, it just doesn't. Right from the beginning you're waiting for the movie to start and something happens. It just doesn't. A serious waste of time."
" Saw movie more than once...
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,10,"Good movie. Blake Lively did a great job of acting. She was a believable blind woman. There were a couple of of things I did not quite understand, so watched the movie 2-3 times to clear these up. So glad I did! Movie shows how we see a person visually , but differently through your senses. Well done."
" Good thriller
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,6,Reminded me of the Nicole Kidman movie Before I Go To Sleep where she is dependant on her husband and nothing is what it seems. Similar premise here. Blake Lively is not my favourite actress but she is very good in this movie and Jason Clarke is very convincing as the dodgy husband. Highly recommend to watch.
" Sounds good, doesn't work
",2019-03-19 00:00:00,2,"This film isn't what it wanted to be. It is a film for easily-impressionable people, who are mesmerized by nice shots and think it's an arthouse film that we, the rest, don't understand. It fools them with suspense (but that doesn't pay in the end), great shots (but that make no higher sense), good acting (that one is true) and a great idea for a movie (but not a great movie). It's a beautiful empty shell. It's like that beautiful toy car that your parents forbidded you to break its original packing in order to play with, so you look at its and say: ""Whoa, the things I would have done with it!"" and your a*hole friend tells you: ""You don't need to actually play with it, only stupid kids do that, you should imagine you play with it, that's the fun!"". It's like the makers had a great idea but didn't know how to come up with details, so they only *hinted* at things. Those easily-impressionable people I was telling you about will say we didn't get it and we only like Marvel films, but come on, empty expectations are as bad as brainless explosions. So All I See Is my lost 1 h 49'."
" Frustrating but good
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,10,"A one sided marriage, a husband who needs to be center of attention. Tries to change fate. His wife get her eye sight back. The wife begins to change and the husband gets frustrated. James goes to their old apartment to collect the last of his and Gina's belongings. In the bathroom, he uncovers a stash of empty eye drop bottles. He realises that Gina discovered his deception and secretly continued to obtain eye drops from the doctor, meaning that she has been faking her blindness. Gina confirms this when she looks directly at him during the talent show. Distraught, James drives home in tears, impairing his vision and causing him to crash into an oncoming truck. Home alone, Gina gives birth. She looks into her baby's eyes"
" Slow, but satisfying.
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this movie, despite not being a big fan of Blake Lively (I find her facial expressions annoying).This is by no means an exciting movie with a huge plot twist. It's very slow, as it should be, taking the time to help us understand the characters and connect with them. (Although, I agree that a few small parts were pointless and added nothing to the plot.) This is definitely one of those ""makes you think"" movies, where you try to put yourself in their shoes and you think you know what you would do. Even though I don't agree with what happens, I can understand the fear and desperation that may drive someone to do the unthinkable.I would like to note that the listed plot for this movie is very misleading, in my opinion. I expected a completely different movie. ""A woman's relationship with her husband changes when she regains her sight"" is all there should be.If you liked this movie, check out ""The Ticket"" with Dan Stevens."
" Lucky 1/10 is the lowest you can rate a movie
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,1,This movie literally has no point. It's almost like watching a regular persons day. No point in this movie! Terrible waste of time.
" See it!
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,9,"I am so glad I didn't listen to the rating of this movie. Seriously, go see it."
" 1 star is way too much for this film
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,1,"Emotionless, pathetic, colourless..
A two hour waste of time.
The depiction of a couple whose life surprisingly falls apart after the (blind) one of them regains her vision.
And then, it's not life as we know it.."
" Subtle With Everything but Sex
",2018-12-04 00:00:00,6,"I liked that this film isn't just another cookie cutter movie. In most cases the scenes and plot were understated. The sex scenes were overdone in my opinion, not matching the style of the rest of the movie. I recommend it for those that like drama and thinking about characters motivations. Blake Lively and Jason Clark were excellent in their roles."
" Bahahahaha
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,1,"No wonder this went straight to tv in Australia, there's no chance you should pay to watch this."
" It kept me watching
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,5,"I didn't like the ending. Very unsatisfying, however I Cannot think of a better one for tbe simple story. A couple in love fall out of love."
" Visually breathtaking. A definite work of art!
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie is absolutely mesmerizing. If you are into deep, surreal, bizarre and stunning movies, you are going to LOVE ""All I See is You""!
Blake Lively is lovely, realistic and natural as Gina, and the entire cast is well-suited to their characters as well.
The locations, colors, filming angles and extensive use of water, glass, flashing lights and flowers illustrate beautifully the contrast of blindness into sight."
" Raw
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,10,"This is my first review of a movie. It's a 10. This movie is not about a blind woman or about her husband. It's about the crumbling of a relationship. Unexplained, raw, lived. It's very touching to see real life on screen."
" Waste of time
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,1,"This movie absolutely crawls along, and I would never have finished it if I hadn't been watching it with someone else. It was also really irritating how they tried to set up the characters like the wife was in the right, and the husband was the evil bad character. He does something unforgivable in the end, but the wife treated him AWFUL after her surgery, so I hated her character too. Honestly felt bad for the husband. A big waste of time that just left me frustrated."
" Disapointing.
",2018-10-10 00:00:00,3,Pretty much sucked with the ending. Didn't really explain anything other than her husband didn't like her when she could see and she didn't like him as much because she could see.
" this movie took me out of my comfort zone....
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,7,"...and strangely enough, I kinda liked it! It's an Interesting concept for a movie and the premise had me hooked from the get go- how would things change if we were cured of blindness in our adulthood? Even though the characters of Gina and James were both flawed to some extent, there was something catharic about watching their relationship fall apart. Watching Gina slowly discover who she is and realising that James may not be for her was compelling viewing. And I felt the tension conveyed throughout the movie when James' character starts to connect the dots about Gina's lies really made me feel tense while I was watching. The uncomfortable eye contact between both Gina and James at the music concert made me feel sad, uncomfortable, and like I was intruding in a really private moment, so kudos to the actors and director for that. The ending just seemed a bit rubbish though, as if they just rushed writing the end of the script and ran out of ideas. Not a feel good movie and certainly not a 'romantic comedy' as Netflix claims, but still worth a watch."
" A failed execution of a movie with an interesting intrigue
",2018-10-06 00:00:00,5,"When a blind woman is given the chance to regain her sight, she accepts it without second thoughts. Unbeknownst to her and her husband though is the fact that their relationship is about to make a radical turn, for better or worse. We're presented the difficulties they encounter and how they are able to react to them.It's a movie which presents an interesting intrigue, that of a woman who suddenly is able to see, while everything that follows falls into the unexpected. Unfortunately, this is about it. The plot itself manages to bring plenty of boredom to make you lose any interest, while at the same time, is not able to provide any emotion or suspense. It's linear, predictable and overall disappointing; even more upsetting if you put the finale into the equation as well, as it does almost nothing that can somehow make up for the mistakes that were previously made. The characters are not very likeable. Their tendency of making questionable decisions doesn't help their cause in any way, being easy not to care for them, even in situations which are presented as extremely tense and dramatic. Furthermore, they are involved multiple times in simply pointless events which don't lead anywhere.The film also uses too much sex throughout which contributes to nothing, especially not as far as the main plot is concerned. It seems to be like some sort of distraction. When the producers were left without any idea regarding the plot, they would simply introduce a sex scene, hoping to regain some interest, but it's a cheap and pointless trick if you ask me.There is another thing about it that needs to be mentioned. I'm talking about the artistic direction. They though that it would be a great idea to show the viewer what she can actually see. It's not a bad thing, especially in terms of realism, drama and evolution, but when you exaggerate it, it simply turns it into a chore. You're forced to see through her blurry sight way too many times that it simply gets tiresome for your own eyes.I have to say that I am profoundly disappointed by it. It had a good idea, it had at least one good actor but with such a bad plot, it wasn't able to get anywhere. No drama, no emotion, no nothing... Just a wasted period in which you'd hope that it would somehow get better but nothing comes. It's a big shame that they ended up only with this outcome..."
" I CAN SEE CLEARLY (SORTA) NOW...!
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,5,"A Blake Lively starrer from a a couple years ago which I don't think even got a theatrical release. A blind woman, who lost her sight to an unspecified car accident, is now in Thailand gets the opportunity to have surgery to restore her vision. Once done & her sight partially returned, her husband (played Jason Clarke) starts to feel jealous because whatever upper hand he had in their relationship (her reliance on his existing senses) starts to fray. When the film explores the lost of sight through impressionistic imagery it plays like crazy (there's a great shot of Lively swimming in a pool surrounded by geometric shapes) but when the story falls on hoary chestnuts like infidelity & a possible relapse in the surgical procedure, it drags the film to a halt. Marc Forster, the Swiss wunderkind, who make films in vastly different genres (zombie apocalypse in World War Z, quirky comedy in Stranger than Fiction & even a Bond film, Quantum of Solace) made a similar film in his debut named Everything Put Together in which a pregnant woman has a miscarriage but she goes through the same stylistic journey as Lively. Almost there but not quite."
" Enjoyable and realistic
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this film very much, and I felt like it could be very realistic to what changes would happen in a relationship if one partner was blind and gained their sight back. Blake Lively did an amazing job and I love seeing her act in a more serious movie. She went above my expectations.
I found her relationship with her husband a bit dismaying, even when the movie started before she got her sight back. He seemed very comfortable being the one in control but it seemed to annoy him at times, how much help she needed, which is strange given how much more angry he got when she could see. I suppose he didn't expect the confidence she would gain, but I don't blame Lively's character for that- he should have known that there would be changes in her personality since such an integral part of her was altered. While Gina was not perfect (no one is, that's what I love about the realism in this movie, there's not a single character who is 100% perfect), her actions were not very different from what I think someone else in her shoes would do. Her husband however was very aggravating and controlling to me, but I suppose that also would not be very different from someone who had never really known who his wife was, because she didn't.
All in all, I enjoyed the movie and it's independent feel, and I very much enjoyed the visuals and the places they filmed. The acting was great to me, and I enjoyed the sexual scenes from the point of view of someone who was blind and then regained their sight. It's not a movie for everyone, sure, since it was more slow and, again, realistic than most movies we see nowadays, but I would still recommend it."
" Beautiful emotion and thought provoking film
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,10,"I think this site should have their helpful vs not helpful changed to agree or disagree because I feel that's where the voting numbers lay. 
This film imo was awesome. She loved him before she could see and after she could see. His love is what I found as the thriller aspect of this. He can't handle her becoming a full ( not needing him to walk or navigate in public, basically her ability to become an independent being threatened him to his core. Think about not knowing what you look like, your home, your husband or anything really anymore. Then you gain that sight and want to live to the fullest with the person you are married too. He was the downfall of the relationship and her whole life independent of him. This movie made me cry, laugh and FEEL. SHE ASKS ""Do you still love me""??? HIS RESPONSE ""Why blonde ""? 
Give this a shot. Hate it or love it to me it's got value and not many movies grab the way this does. For all the naysayers re: sex. It's about a married couple and them as individuals. Sex is apart of all of us and this in no way is some over the top about sex scenes movie. I"
" why is this movie so sexual???
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,1,I hated it. extremely boring and super sexual. the idea of a blind wife getting her sight back and it changes her relationship with her husband is great... but this movie is a waste of time. so sexual and there are scenes that i just don't understand why the are even in the film (sister husband painting scene..WTF?!)bad movie. waste of time.
" Haunting and sobering
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,6,"The movie is beautifully shot, and I found it to be a poignant portrayal of a marriage, rife with insecurities and plenty of blame to go around. It's not a all-man-hating movie - but we do hate hate on one specific man. Oh the things one will do when motivated by jealousy and control."
" movie about cheating and lies.
",2018-09-06 00:00:00,2,Thought the movie was going to be like At First Sight. but turned out to be a movie about a cheater. lost respect for the wife.
" I like challenging films, usually; this one I didn't but Lively gives a great performance
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,7,"Gina (Blake Lively) has been blind since her preteen years. Her parents died in the car crash which damaged her eyes yet she seems to have a good life. For one, she has a devoted husband, James (Jason Clarke) who has a lucrative insurance job. Two, the couple lives in Thailand, exotic and interesting. Finally, Gina has musical talent and teaches guitar while also enjoying swimming and caring for her dog. As she very much wants to become a mother, she consults doctors. One of them, an eye specialist, believes he can restore her right eye's sight. What happy news! The operation is a success and soon Gina is adjusting to the sighted world again. Only, things are not as happy for her as she expected them to be. James and she have always has a fine love life but it suffers when his appearance is not as appealing to her as it was when she couldn't see. Then, she doesn't like their apartment's drabness and tells James she wants to search for a house. She also buys new, more revealing clothes and dyes her hair blonde. This upsets James very much, as he feels her moving in directions he doesn't control. A ""second honeymoon"" in Spain doesn't rekindle their closeness, either. Also, Gina begins to think James has been tampering with the eye drops she must take every day, as her sight grows dimmer. Will the couple stay together? This challenging movie has a good story which is somewhat difficult to piece together. Amid a bevy of interesting camera shots, sparse conversations and ""you figure it out"" happenings, the viewer must struggle to keep up. In some flicks, this is appealing but, this time, along with a slow pace, it fails to keep a movie fans attentions at every moment. Then, too, while the settings are spectacular, the movie has many well-deserved R-rated sex scenes which makes it unsuitable for many viewers. Lively it truly wonderful in a difficult role but neither she nor the other actors are very likeable. Therefore, if all you can see are a few choice films a year, you can feel free to skip this one."
" Reels you in, but leaves you disappointed.
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,6,"I just kept watching because I was a little confused the entire movie, thinking a huge plot twist would clear everything up. I was pretty disappointed. 
But it was enough of a thriller to make me watch the entire movie."
" It's not bad, but it's not good either.
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,6,"What to say about this film? Well it's /very/ slow for one. A lot of needless sex scenes, maybe to try and trick us into thinking it's interesting? Who knows. I think this movie could have worked amazingly as a thriller. It seemed like that was the route it was taking when you find out the husband has been changing her eye drops, and disposed of the dog. However we just wind up with a less than satisfying ending to a mediocre movie about a woman trying to work her way through life with new sight and a clingy, obsessive, borderline abusive husband. It does kill the time but I also found myself wondering ""god when is this over? When does she push him off the stairs already?"" Sadlt my dream for his comeuppance did not happen but this is why we have fan fiction authors in this day and age."
" Just terrible
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,1,"This ""movie"" is a bland waste of
Time with no real plot or sense of direction, it keeps moving forward but it seems to never stop. The slow and plot and mediocre performance from most of the actors creates a awful film. Some scenes are actually pretty but that's the only slight bit of praise I can give it. I can not suggest strongly enough to stay away from this film."
" Refreshingly honest depiction of a flawed relationship and power dynamics
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,9,"Although I understand the negative reviews on here that question the suitablitity of this film within the thriller genre, I found it a thought-provoking and interesting piece of drama. I must confess I'm a fan of Blake Lively, but this was a fantastic portrayal of the intense personal journey that a blind person goes through as they regain, and then relose, their sight. Her character's questioning and rebuilding of her identity ultimately dooms her marriage with her husband, who emerges as a controlling and deceptive person in response to her transformation and the shift in power dynamics in their relationship. The cinematography is great and the almost psychedelic images that emulate Blake's character's sight are fascinating. A thoroughly enjoyable film."
" I didn't mind it
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,6,"I liked that this film was different. It was stylised. It wanted emotions to simmer. There were many similes and foreboding elements. And not everything was made obvious or answered. Yes, it took far too long to get to the good stuff. And the mystery could have been even more complex and puzzling, if you ask me. But the crayon letter was poetic as it compared Gina's dog to Gina. The kaleidoscopic intimate scenes resembled a kind of sensory overload when sight is removed. There were deceptions by both parties (ranging from trivial to abominable), steering away from the obvious victim vs villain rhetoric. 6/10 for me."
" Average
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,5,"This is an average movie at best!
It was a pleasure to see Blake Lively in another role (other than Gossip Girl) but unfortunately the storyline wasn't all that gripping.
It's basically a story of which the lead gets her sight back partially, which seems to change the dynamic of her relationship with her Husband, something that still baffles me. But then his behavior baffles me as well.
Getting her sight restored, gave the lead more confidence and gave her a sense of adventure...which after being blind since childhood, you can understand. But then she also became less appreciative of her Husband and less respectful toward him. Having a confidence boost I can understand, being mean to a person who's been there for you and supported you I cannot. That seemed selfish!
But then of course he was selfish switching the eye drops, due to not liking the new change in his Wife. And what he did with her dog was unforgivable. I also don't get why (as she obviously knew) she pretended to not be able to see...why not just be honest, have it out with him and try figuring out what the issue is. Instead of playing mind games with each other.
There's no way that a married couple who really loved each other, would actually do any of these things, just because of regained sight. Unless the only thing they loved about each other was feeling needed and being co-dependent. 
I found this story to be a sad/depressives one, but well acted for the most part overall"
" Wow!
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,1,Did someone purposely make this movie? Horrible. It was a waste of time and was pointless.
" Pointless beautiful
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,5,Regardless on the relationship between Jenny and her husband witch I don't Comprehend at all let's talk about the vivid and mesmerising motion pictures and I liked how the director show the poetry in a blind woman seeing the world for The first time but The film The film will not Be stuck in your mind for a long time it's a meh
" For the mature
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,7,I enjoyed this movie .. felt sorry for the husband at the end it was so clear that he absolutely adored her.
" Honest story
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,7,I really liked this film because it wasn't over the top and all Hollywood milked. It was a chilled film with a story of a marriage where there is control and change is making it disruptive. Blake Lively is always the charming actress she always is.
" Now you see me, now you don't
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,5,"Producer, director, writer Marc Forster is best known for directing the films Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland, The Kite Runner, Quantum of Solace and World War Z wrote this screenplay with Sean Conway (TV series Ray Donavan and Shameless). ALL I SEE IS YOU is a theme with challenge to any writer: these tow men almost meet that challenge but seem to get lost in the process. The result is a very long, tedious, cinematographer's holiday (Matthias Koenigswieser) about the world we see and the world we don't see. Despite the presence of some fine actors the film is tedious and loses the audience after about thirty minutes of blurry (but colorful!) versions of the world passing by the eyes of a blind girl. Apparently blinded since childhood when a hideous car-crash cost her her parents and her eyesight (a fact that is never explained - we must guess that is the case), beautiful Gina (Blake Lively) scarcely leaves their home in Bangkok, Thailand and is dependent on her attentive and doting husband, James (Jason Clark), who is her everything: her protector, her guide, and the sole intermediary with the outside world and who has never known the sighted Gina, and wants to make a baby. Medicine intervenes, a cutting-edge but highly experimental cornea transplant By one Dr. Hughes (Danny Huston) promises to restore Gina's vision, at least to her right eye--and when the bandages come off all of a sudden unexplored colors and senses begin to appear to her. But she is dependent on steroid drops in her eyes to assure the transplant takes. As a result, Gina will see her husband and her unknown reflection in the mirror for the first time, she befriends an unwanted dog, makes friends with dog walker cum sensual interest (Wes Chatham), and with time and some distance from James and an odd visit to her Barcelona sister Carla (Ahna O'Reilly) and her artsy husband Ramon (Miquel Fernández) Gina becomes pregnant (though James has discovered he is sterile!), and her vision is altered again - the reason is only suggested. And then the film ends.Chunks of the story are missing (?intentionally?) and the constant cinematic version of the world through near blind eyes becomes as tiring to the audience as it must to the patient with altered eyesight. There are some odd sidebars of Gina playing the guitar with a young girl, surreal shots of Bangkok, strange S&M scenes unexplained that keep our attention at times. The concept regarding blindness and how it affects the victim are sound. It is the delivery of the 'story' that begs editing."
" Could have been great
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,7,"First a few reasons why this movie failed:
The director spent way too much time seeing the world through the eyes of a 99% blind woman. That meant that 20% of the film was a blurry colorful mess, because all she could see was light and colorful mush.The sex was overdone, and felt gratuitous and forced. Foster tried to get Lively to show as much of her naked body as possible, and actually resorted to a body double at one point. We all know that Blake Lively isn't going to get naked for any director, until she is well into her forties when no one will care anyway. So goes the modest Hollywood actress.Key twist and plot occurrences were under-played and vague, and the editing in general left plenty to be desired. The sad part is, Foster actually had a goldmine on his hands if this movie was done right. The story is very unique: A young blind woman that's never seen her husband, and has never seen what he does when she is unattended, suddenly, through new surgery, regains most of her sight, and eventually gets to ""see"" the real life she has been living, and the man she trusted as her partner, may not have been the hero she thought he was.On the bright side, this movie even as badly directed as it was, was beautifully shot, and some of the locations were gorgeous. If you could sit through the boredom of Foster's directing, you would find a real movie, and a great story worthy of a better job. I still am giving it 7 out of 10, because it was such a unique concept, just poorly executed."
" Captivating!
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,9,"Where was the advertising for this movie? It really deserved a bigger audience. I urge you to watch and pass it on word of mouth. 
It's a beautiful study in human dynamics - taken to the extreme. Nothing in either characters behavior is really all that surprising or unexpected, with the obvious exception to his deceitful betrayal and response to what he considers as his world unraveling. Something perhaps a bit of therapy might have avoided had the surgeon seen fit to foresee likely problems and recommend it. Not that far of a stretch. 
When one person has been a full time caregiver for another, and is suddenly now no longer ""needed"" in that capacity it can truly mess with your head, strange as that may sound. 
We humans are complex creatures and we find our patterns, no matter how tragic in nature or origin, to be quite comfortable especially over time. It becomes what we know, and somehow what we tend to cling to, even in the face of obvious and contrary reason. 
Blake Lively continues to impress. She has hidden depths which I am happy to see being portrayed in more serious subject matter. I fully expect to see even better roles for her in future. A nice HBO or Netflix limited series would place her front and center in the public's eyes and give her a place to shine. I hope she gets it. 
I rated this movie a 9, but I may as well have rated it a 10; I honestly don't know anything that held me back. Hindsight. Go figure. I suppose contemplating ""perfection"" is always daunting. 
I hope you enjoy this journey, for a journey it most certainly is."
" A pretentious, self-conscious little film, that bores rather than impresses.
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,3,"Most reviewers seem to agree that this was a boring and rather pointless film. One of the ""positive"" reviews suggests that everyone who disliked this film is ""unsophisticated"". Well, I can't speak for the others, but personally I consider myself a reasonably sophisticated film buff. I tend to prefer films that are less ""artsy"", but as a former film student and someone who has worked in theatre, film, and TV since the age of 14, I have been exposed to (and enjoyed) a wide and eclectic range of dramatic entertainment - and art - over the years, and I still found ALL I SEE IS YOU to be a boring and pretentious load of twaddle.Technically it is very well made, from a visual standpoint at least, and the actors do a passable job with the weak material they are given. But it is in the writing and directing that this film falls down. There just isn't enough in it to justify such lavish visuals, as on their own they amount to little more than directorial masturbation. More solid storytelling was required - and it didn't have to be conventional if it didn't want to; experimental would have been fine - but there needed to me a stronger and more coherent narrative upon which to hang all those visuals. And the visuals themselves needed to be better contained, more cohesive, and more sparingly used.For example, the POV shots are great, particularly the eye-blinks, which are the best I've ever seen. And mostly they illustrate the varying degrees of vision-loss in an interesting and creative way. If the film limited itself to just these, as the sum-total of weird, psychedelic imagery, it may have been a lot better. But unfortunately we are given more of the same sort of imagery to illustrate the character's internal thoughts. And more again as just general shots of places and things, that are neither POV's or internal imagery. They're just the director getting off on too much VFX. The net product is a confusing and rather irritating mishmash that makes it very hard to follow the paper-thin narrative, and inclined this particular viewer to keep dozing off - aided by the trance-inducing music and sound design!All in all, there wasn't enough plot to keep me interested, none of the characters were particularly engaging or likeable, the visuals, music, and sound design threatened to put me in a coma, and there wasn't nearly as much sex and nudity as Netflix's hysterical warnings led me to expect, so I didn't even get to enjoy a psychedelic boner!Disappointing all round. I gave it three stars for effort and nice locations."
" Very good and interesting movie
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,9,"This movie could not be understand by everybody. There are sophisticated moments which only sensitive and empathetic people can understand.
I like it very much!"
" ""We don't know who me is.""- more a case of rediscovery inevitably gone bad than insecurity- and how not to cope with loss.
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,8,"First off, I don't see any problems with the pacing, the visuals, or the music in the movie. All were fine and in fact, although the ending felt a bit rushed, it was not just meaningful but also artistic without being pretentious.I agree, however, with some of the reviewers that it more falls into the drama genre than thriller. I have a brief moment of disappointment with good flicks that are categorized wrong, but that's about it.Now... My character analysis is somewhere between the spectrum of views from the reviewers.The movie does not clearly hint at any possibility that Clarke's character specifically went out to find someone permanently vulnerable to marry, due to a handicap. When you extrapolate the characters into the past, perhaps some of the audience would say that is very likely. Understandably so, as there are many people who actually feel so insecure as to purposely marry totally dependent partners. The problem in the movie is, though, Lively's character doesn't waste time to confirm her husband's fears, and denies it when confronted.It would be only natural for her to change her looks following the operation- she had to see herself first to know what she wanted to look like.That was not what troubled the husband. It could have been, in other cases, but the movie tells us that it is not.What critically troubled the husband was that scene on the train that he kept replaying, closing up on his wife's face as she thought no one was watching.Also the realizations: 1. she lied about the man in the park 2. she said she was pregnant, without knowing her husband was sterile.Whereas he could confront her and file a divorce or give her a second chance, the husband hatched a wicked plan to have her blind self back, failing to accept the fact that newly gained eyesight would make one discover more about oneself and have preferences with things one had no way of deciding before. As Gina said: ""we don't know who me is."" This was the problem. The husband could only get to know this new wife as fast as she could get to know more of herself. This problem was not mutually shared, as the wife had understandably welcomed the changes with delight.Said another way, changes happen faster than the husband is able to let sink in and upon realizing that he is losing his wife, he tries to reverse the process back to when he knows she would need him, therefore would keep him, as if he can make her unsee things, rewind time. So he tries to actually blind her. That is how mentally sick he has become. As the wife is singing this song on stage from a time when she was blind and all she saw was him, and staring straight in his eyes all the time... there's this silent conversation via exchanges of gazes of how she used to love him, how she could still see and knew what he had been up to, and how he ruined it all. He gets the messages, walks out on her and jumps in his car, and, absorbed in a very emotionally intense session of self-introspection and judgment while driving, ends up in a fatal accident.A life ends as a new one begins. Things move on, one way or another. If he had thought about it before the operation he could prepare and therefore grant himself ""the serenity to accept the things he cannot change"".I loved almost everything about the movie without the need to root for either of these two characters who had become very realistically unlikable as the movie proceeded. I respect this in a movie. A cold but sincere little flick."
" better than the reviews
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,6,"Ok, this film has a lot of twists and turns and moves fast. and several disconnects. which I am still trying to piece together...but it's not horrible."
" A thoughtful, well directed, beautifully shot and acted 'sort of' thriller
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,8,"I went into this film blind (pun intended) not really knowing much about it at all, but needing something 'romantic' from Netlix for a Saturday afternoon. Blake Lively is always interesting to me whether in engaging dramas like Age of Adeline or in engaging nonsense such as The Shallows. It's immediately interesting and the opening images arresting: a kaleidoscope of bodies, a couple in the throes of passion, silken sheets and milky skies - beautifully blended. The images make sense when we discover that Lively's character Gina, is blind - was blinded in a car accident that killed her parents. Her husband, James, dotes on her, caters for her every need, spoils her - he seems quietly, perhaps subconsciously grateful for the position of power their situation puts him in. The first 30 minutes knits together the confusion and frustration of Gina's everyday life perfectly sometimes taking us behind her eyes to experience the lights and the shapes that Gina can almost see as we follow her to the pool, teaching guitar, and to the doctors where she is told that a transplant is possible. The mood shifts dramatically when Gina regains partial sight. She gets a new lease of life. She soaks everything in. She wants to experience everything she's been missing. Gina is ecstatic in her new found sense - on a trip to Spain to visit her sister, she begins to shrug off the old Gina and starts to transform, sexing up her wardrobe, starting to wear makeup, almost purposefully seeking out moments to excite and arouse her. James starts to think that he won't be enough for her and indeed the things she took for granted are not what she expected and not necessarily what she wants.Whilst what follows is definitely psychological, and in part thrilling, this is very much a study of a relationship on the precipice and the extremes we'll go to when cornered or desperate. Gina realises that life has options, and James will do anything he can to try and limit them, to salvage what they have. I found this film incredibly satisfying. I found the union of Gina and James, the transition to a new way of living, Gina's effervescence for her new life and James's acute anxiety that he is about to lose everything really believable. There's a real tension and it's all played beautifully and naturally. There's a moment (a millisecond) near the end where it veers towards melodrama, and even though not the romantic comedy I was looking for, was a film I'm definitely glad I've seen."
" Stylish but lacking in thrills
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,2,"Having no expectations and not knowing too much about this film, All I see is you is described has a thriller but in general, their weren't too much thrills and suspense. It felt more like a slow paced drama with some occasional scenes of interest. It also felt longer than its running time of 1 hour 40 minutes (that not excluding end credits).Also quite predictable in that we knew once Blake Lively compleyely heals and gauins back her eye sight, her character change was going to occur and as expected she does change for the worse, and her attitude towards her husband (Jason Clarke) become more obvious as she becomes more unlikable. In fact, really most of the characters were unlikable, especially Jason Clarke, as we wonder why and how Blake and him were together in the first place. The visuals and colors are nice to look at and they were several sex scenes, that felt as if they were to put for the audiences to forgot that the movie is quite slow and nothing happens, as if the director wanted to distract us.The ending felt rushed and as it happened then once we see the end credits come in, we ask ""that's it?"" and ""it's over?"". In conclsuion this fiml feels as if it was one of those ""paycheck"" type films which he actors needed and wasn't something they were completely interested in."
" Insecure man needs a handicapped women to feel justified
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,8,"Seems like half of the reviewers here failed to notice, that this movie was not about the feminist propaganda or the egoistic lifestyle of a 21s century women pursuing their own dreams and desires, but about the realization that the only reason this couples relationship worked was because Gina was in a very vulnerable state, handicapped, totally relying on her husband taking care of her 24/7, and the sad realization that her husband would do anything to get her back to that vulnerable state again, by changing her eyedrops, so that she would go blind again, and by taking the dog away in a very cruel way tying her to a tree, just so that she couldn't go outside anymore to have some fun. I found this deep story of the film totally disgusting, but at the same time utterly beautiful, because this is reality, relationships and marriages are often full of egoistic desires, and oppressions, lies and manipulations...even though I sympathize with the female character Gina I found her behavior totally disgusting as well, she obviously got knocked up by that other dude, since her husband was told by the doctor that he couldn't father a child. Ally by all, wonderful movie, with a wonderful message, but I would rather call it a drama instead of a thriller."
" Interesting
",2018-06-15 00:00:00,7,"Maybe the reviews here reflect people's personal experiences and how they related to the story. I liked it for the most part. I'm actually surprised about people feeling the female lead was a cruel bXXX. I can only imagine regaining eyesight would dramatically alter someone's perception and have inevitable ripple effects on everyone and everything in their life. And sadly, yes, a lot of guys get very upset when they feel like they aren't in control of their partners, the people they work with etc. etc. and may not behave very well, what more needs to be said?"
" What??
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,5,"I like both main actors but jeez I just don't understand the point of this movie. 48mins into it, yes I was checking the clock, and the story didn't seem to go any where. Quite boring and no thrill."
" It's watchable, but too predictable
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,5,"This movie attempt at suspense and thrills is a 5 out of 10 because some things became too predictable and obvious.
1. We all knew the hubby has an inferiority complex. 
2. His actions towards her getting her vision back was predictable because he didn't like her behavior. 
3. We knew she was playing games with him after she found out what he was doing to herIt was watchable but not anything genius."
" Awakening to reality of inner selves
",2018-04-11 00:00:00,9,"I am so glad that I did not fool by the imdb credits again. Misleading and being very unfair to decent viewers.
Director Mark Forster made a very good job by this extraordinary movie. Deeply touched to my soul. 
There is much more then words in the film. Makes you being part of it. It is not easy to describe. When you start to watch you will realize you are more then a viewer.
It is very a poetic film in every way. 
Let's you fly to inner sides but at the same time wakes you up with some shocking truths however every time you leap kindly puts you down delicately again as if you are the sensetive baby of this cruel world. The movie photography is marvelous. One of the reviewers describe like eye-candy. I surely totally agree with him/her.I quite enjoyed this psychological marriage drama but surely it is more then that. This is a film you can watch over and over again with same pleasure.
I would like to thank the director again for such a good writing and exposing. Also cast was very successful indeed. One of the best film of last decades"
" Good movie but a slight disappointment
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,6,The movie starts out relatively interesting. TThe storyline is good but the ending was very abrupt. As soon as the credits started rolling i was just kinda like wait...what? And I hate that about movies. Based on the reviews I wasn't expecting something out of this world and before even in starting the movie I exptected thw problem of the movie to be the end in which I was right. I feel like this was just a money filler for the both of these main actors. The movie had my undivided attention but ultimately the ending could have been done differently...
" One rally mediocre movie
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,2,"You see...it looks like a promising movie. She can't see...then she can. When it looks like something really thrilling is to happen...it doesn't. You stay like waiting for it to make sense, it never does. Nothing really worthy. The story seems to be left in a very dull moment which stays on and nothing really unfolds. You leave the movie theater with some question marks...how can someone transform a promising plot in a very dull and nonsense? Idk! Maybe I am too demanding these days when it seems that movies are sometimes produced to be a failure."
" Tense that leads to nothing
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,3,Very boring movie with no good plot. Have a lot of unfinished side stories and a non-sense script.
" Watch when you can't sleep. Here is the cure.
",2018-03-20 00:00:00,3,"What can you say about a movie with a cool premise, good performances, creative direction, decent soundtrack, and above average cinematography? Let's start with the biggest misnomer because this a mystery but there really isn't any mystery here. In fact the only mystery that I found was where the mystery was! The reoccurring theme of the POV shot from Gina cwith a blinking eye got real old throughout the entire movie. Maybe I'm just sore because they took a good idea, and in my opinion ruined it. In my opinion this movie is only barely watchable and it's too bad because I like Blake Lively. In spite of the performances, this movie just fall short."
" This is a film made by amateurs starring amateurs

" Lovely film, but not for everyone
",2018-03-14 00:00:00,9,"This is a really good film. I really really loved it and I don't get all the negative reviews. I didn't get bored at all and it totally made sense from the beginning till the end. That being said, it's not for everyone. You have to be a little bit more mature and have had serious relationships in the past to understand it. It evolves more around Gina and James' marriage and its evolution after she restores her sight and tries to find her true self, now that she has the power to choose her clothes, make up, hobbies etc. You can see the characters evolve in front of your eyes in an absolutely realistic way, you can even relate to them, feel their agony, theis fears and understand their actions. Blake Lively shines in this film. She's more charming han ever. Jason's lark performance is very nice too. After all, I think James' (Jason Clarks') evolution and reactions in the film are the most interesting part of all."
" all I see is pretty colours
",2018-03-13 00:00:00,1,"Literally that's it. All I See is You is, in my opinion, the film epitome of the phrase ""look at the pretty colours"". There is nothing here. This ""movie"" consists of a collection of flowery, overblown images laced with bright lights. It's shiny, it's even pretty at times, but that's because the sparkly prettiness is the entire focus of this ""film"".I feel that All I See is You was created to show off some stylish imagery, rather than to tell a story of any kind. This is no movie. There were actors half-heartedly trying (and failing) to breathe life into paper characters, but honestly... it's all about the pretty colours."
" Gloomy & Depressing
",2018-03-06 00:00:00,4,"I was looking forward to watching this film, the trailer looked OK. I like Blake Lively and I thought this movie would be quite interesting to watch. I can't say Im fully disappointed, I was expecting a plot that revolved around silent emotional abuse and that is exactly what you end up getting in this movie. The acting was alright. The first half was in my opinion pretty bad and the movie did improve towards the end. I just found the duration span of this movie quite long and the plot surely seems to drag on for eternity. The ending for me was the worst of all it's what broke the camel's back. I just didn't buy it, it seemed rushed and abrupt. This movie deals with some pretty dark themes but it tries to lighten up the mood a bit, the emotional abuse is very subtle and aside from a few outbreaks and lashing outs it was hardly evident. Co-dependency is a very serious mental issue and I thought the plot at least made how unhealthy that is obvious enough. What I didn't like was the way the characters dealt with each other, how they interacted and how the story ended.I don't have to tell you not to watch this, because apparently this movie costed 30 Million USD to make but its revenue from the box office was 217,644 USD. The release date got pushed back twice as well, until it was finally released in October of 2017. I can see this movie wasn't popular enough from the get go, however in case you're thinking of watching this save yourself the trouble."
" Interesting
",2018-03-06 00:00:00,6,"Just to let you know, I have watched over 2,200 movies/shows. This movie is slow just to let everyone know. But this story is very interesting in how things in a marriage can change when you add or subtract one single variable. This movie is not exciting but it is a good movie to watch once and twice if you didn't get it the first time."
" Good plot idea but terrible movie.
",2018-02-20 00:00:00,1,"This movie is like a a blind version of 50 shades of gray with a bad marriage story thrown in it. The story sounds better on paper than it does on film. A married visually impaired woman (she's not completely blind) has an operation and when she can see again her personality changes to becoming pretty much a club tramp and then she cheats on her husband and ends up getting pregnant. The husband in the film loves his wife and wants to have a child with her. He's boring but he's a devoted businessman and he's devoted to his wife. He doesn't like doing things that are too wild and prefers to play it safe. His wife on the other hand likes to let herself loose but she can't see so she can only do but so much since she has to depend on her square of a husband. There's a scene where they go dancing and she's having fun acting wild but the husband thinks it's stupid and ruins her fun. There's another scene where she's trying to have ""adventurous"" sex with him and he's not into it and it spoils her fun. It's obvious his wife was always a club tramp and wild but being blind made her tame. Once she can see again her wild side comes back out and her husband is now the bad guy holding her back from being her. Now here's the thing. His wife doesn't work, she doesn't pay bills, and she certainly didn't pay for some expensive operation to get her sight back.  Her husband does everything for her and she repays him by treating him like crap once she can see again and then going out and cheating on him and getting pregnant and not even telling him that the baby isn't his (oh but he knows it's not) but he plays along because he loves her so much.The movie makes the husband seem like the villian holding her back from being the real her. They even have him doing something stupid like tampering with her eye medicine so that she goes blind again. Yeah that was terrible but on the scale of cheating AND getting pregnant AND not telling her husband the baby isn't his that's a minor infraction. Besides he only did it because he wanted her back to the woman he feel in love with and not the rude bar tramp that she became. Long story short the ending is the big reveal he ends up killing himself and she ends up having the other guys baby and also she can see her husbands trick didn't work.
 GREAT MOVIE ENDING!She has a kid and lives happily ever after probably living off his life insurance policy and he's dead because his wife was a cheating tramp and he made the mistake of marrying/ever loving her.THIS MOVIE SUCKED!"

The plot said things that don't match up to the actual movie! Blake Lively girl you know you better than this! I am shocked of how this movie turned out, I actually had high hopes before the release, instead I'm left with immoral and obnoxious scenes that don't serve any purpose to the plot.. oh wait.. I'm sorry.. THERE IS NO PLOT."
" All I see are unsophisticated reviewers!
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,9,"It is a really good thing that I don't implicitly trust the raw IMDb average review score of a move before deciding whether to see it or not.This was an excellent movie, made unique specifically by the fact that it wasn't the typical feel-good, everything is explained in the end, cookie-cutter Hollywood drivel! It seems too many viewers today are looking to disengage their brain and be spoon-fed a story-line where all character arcs are complete and all questions answered - sad really. I appreciated the fact that this movie allowed us to view a complex and dynamic relationship, and afterwards do our own critical thinking and take some personal meaning away from the story.I'm also particularly amused by the hypocritical puritan nut-jobs who lambasted the film by judging Gina's actions as a negative commentary on the entire female gender - get real people!! The intent is a realistic story setting, and in reality humans actually do have sex and are fallible (have affairs/become jealous). If you are looking for a perfect (but unrealistic) fantasy world depiction ... stick to Marvel comic movies :) However, if you like being engaged with an intense and realistic story that demands some thinking by the viewer (and beautifully set in Thailand), you won't be disappointed."
" hard to feel relationship
",2018-02-17 00:00:00,4,"Gina (Blake Lively) is happily married to James (Jason Clarke). She's blind since childhood. She has surgery to restore his eyesight. Its success lead to trouble in her marriage and her life.Director Marc Forster wants to say something compelling about the human condition. It's hard to see real humanity in these characters. It's lots of blurry muddle and I don't mean her vision. I don't understand their relationship or their conflict in terms of real human existence. It's confused going in and confused coming out. Well, it's stylish anyways."
" I Didn't See It
",2018-02-13 00:00:00,4,"1. A good part of the film is from the blurry, psychedelic viewpoint and similar imaginations of our nearly blind female lead - Gina. Problem: Excessively redundant and I didn't really feel for her lack of vision. 
2. The second most prevalent time devotion of the film is her husband's devotion to helping/being with her needs. To a point that it is difficult to tell who is most dependent, and who is most disturbed by it. 
3. Essentially the film's story runtime plays out those two points. Except, our husband and wife each harbor secrets which are suppose to be the intrigue in this tale, but as it turns out I felt as if they simply spicy additions that didn't quite fit with the rest of the story. And, the endings were equally as superficially ill fitting."
" See it for Lively

Clarke is the creepy husband of blind Lively who is suddenly given the chance to see with an experimental surgery. But instead of enhancing the marriage the relationship starts to fall apart. They do things to one another that shows distrust and insecurity. See it for Lively."

" ""50 Shades"" for people, who want a movie to massage more than the reptile part of their brain
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,6,"The pretty girl (Blake Lively), having been blind for most of her life, gets as a chance of restoring the sight.But how does it change her and the relationship with husband (Jason Clarke) who's been supportive so far? (Also appearing, Danny Huston, Ahna O'Reilly, Miguel Fernández, Wes Chatham et al.)American mainstream movie industry has a habit of turning every big success story into genre, wave, or at least franchise, but curiously enough, it hasn't happened with ""50 Shades"".There's something about sensual and dark side of passion that they don't just 'get', or are afraid to look closer at, so more 'intelligent' projects like ""All I See Is You"" may be the answer to this global sensation that ""Shades"" built.I am too lazy to browse the web to research and confirm Marc Forster's intentions for making ""All I See Is You"" exactly... But it sure does feel like an attempt to capture the same audience - in search of sensuality coupled with 'dark' themes such as passion, commitment and the fear of it, human nature's undying symbolical need to merge into one with the loved one, etc.That's not how the promotional materials present it, but that's how I felt during watching.An auteur like Forster is too ambitious, of course, to be interested mostly in the sensual side. ""All I See Is You"" is more about the psychological side of passion and how it affects us. There are some carnal (screen) pleasures to be had, but not much.Forster - as the director and one of the writers - has aimed for suspenseful relationship drama, and the two stars (Blake Lively, Jason Clarke) are certainly up to the challenge, both able thespians as they are.Lively is clearly the star here, with an intriguing dual role of being one girl before and quite the new one after regaining her sight. When the life situation brings major changes, it brings out major changes in us as well, so she walks around like a constant source of mystery.It's always interesting to see her reactions to situations and how subtly Lively can express them. There's some mysterious, child-like presence in her, which only adds to the intrigue, and becomes the movie's strongest attraction.Unfortunately, I felt that the story never finds a sure stable footing, thus moving uncomfortably between clearly focused story and series of events which feel quite loosely connected.The last third of the 110 minutes is actually pretty enjoyable. By then, the makers have disposed subplots going nowhere and concentrated on the main line. We can understand, if not relate to, the motifs of the characters and where they come from.The first hour, on the other hand, feels interesting but unconvincing. It adds a constant nervous energy to both situations and characters which is never explained.Many scenes and events go nowhere fast, then end abruptly, never to be discussed again, like a pet left on the roadside.This pretty much rounds up the first two-thirds of the movie. Scenes start in the unexplainedly nervous atmosphere, end soon, and can't well be put in the bigger perspective because it's difficult to understand the characters motifs in the first place.They just wince, show they're stressed or uncomfortable, and move on. Asking ""What?"" or ""Are you OK?"" all the time is not a strong technique to show a developing relationship on screen.In real life, this kind of relationship would be totally realistic and possible, with moodiness, unexplained tension just hanging around them and all.But this kind of not-too-artsy movie can't have luxury of being too much like the real life. We need answers, or it becomes exhausting in 10-15 minutes.All in all... some of it works, and pretty well, but big part of the movie feels underdeveloped or overcooked. Was it sloppy writing or the material did not gel together well during post-production & editing? Who knows. Those interested will find some answers online, hopefully.Forster's career as a ""serious"" director has always been a hit-and-miss affair, and for the last ten years he has mostly made concentrated on mainstream action side of things.So it's not that surprising to see ""All I See Is You"" being born as hit-and-miss affair as well. It's not bad, per se, and the central story is definitely intriguing, but the result is just not satisying enough.I am not as harsh on the result as, say, most of the critics found on Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, but I agree that Forster has not given his best, or had a chance to do that."
" It's not really a thriller, so what's it supposed to be?
",2018-02-02 00:00:00,2,"I feel like this had the potential to be a great thriller, but there's so many things that went wrong so sadly I can't say it is. The main problem is the pacing, there's just no build up of suspense for the majority of the movie, and so the final sequence of events happen so quickly so as to almost feel rushed. Also whereas the husband is clearly meant to be the antagonist in the story, and the wife is the heroine, there's just something that doesn't quite sit right with me about her, and I feel like both characters come off as quite unlikeable by the end. I mean I know it was really bad for him to change the eye drops, so sure I can accept him as the bad guy, he got it coming to him in the end. But as for the wife let's just put it this way, when she gets her vision back she becomes quite rude towards her husband, self centred, sleeps with another guy, then lies about it and even has a baby which she clearly tries to pass off as the husband's, and then pretends that she's still blind when she can actually see, and by the end after he kills himself and she has the baby it's like it was supposedly a good turn of events, like a sort of redemption. There's a feminist quality to the protagonist, and by regaining her sight it distills this power within her, and that by challenging her newfound self empowerment the husband became the villain. The funny thing is that I felt more sympathy for the husband for the most of the movie... hell maybe that's just me, but I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of people who like this movie are women, but either way it's just bad.So to answer the initial question 'It's not really a thriller, so what's it supposed to be?', well it's kind of like a very average drama with unlikeable characters, really not a good combination. But if we could take away any real moral from the story it's that people can change, and not just from regaining eyesight, these things happen, and you just have to be careful about heavily investing your life into someone when they can completely change. And to realise when you are both no longer compatible for each other and when to walk away. Clearly this movie deals with this in a very negative way, and ultimately the ending was just downright depressing."
" Plain and dull
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,2,"My overall impression of this movie is very simple. Let's show the world how Blake Lively is hot, like we already do not know that. Very unoriginal script, too.If I need to ""like"" something, that would be a scene at flowers market, very nice :-)"
" More of a travelogue for Thailand's Tourist Industry...
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,3,"With more aerial shots of Thailand and its beautiful countryside its actually more of an advert for Thailand and Holidays than a movie.Its slow and full of stupid dialogue about penis size and sex and very little in the way of an actual story.Directors seem inordinately obsessed with sex these days - personally I am with Boy George on that one and would rather have a cuppa Earl Grey myself than watch simulated sex scenes in movies - I prefer the old days where a kiss was enough and disappear to the bedroom. To me it just slows the movie down and in most instances does nothing for the story.This is not really like watching paint dry, its actually more tedious than that!"
" failed potential, twisted plot
",2018-01-23 00:00:00,6,"What could have been a moral fable supportive of every man and woman engaged in living together turned out to be yet another man-hating movie preaching that women better be girls that fend for themselves.
torment, selfishness and cruelty, is what the plot is drawn out of, a somewhat dark an pitiful perspective on life.
To achieve this, the scenarist needed to carve the male protagonist in the posture of a person that fails to enjoy life, a loser, possessive, reluctant and introvert.
For the first hour you will be introduced to the life of a couple, regularly through the blurry lenses of the female protagonist. The slow pacing of the movie is not a problem there:
before the story even begins, we are given a few clues about some discrete forces in society that tear couples apart: bragging and lust, obsessions and anxiety.
Gina is a blind woman who lives her intimacy in a very solitary yet colorful way. Closed off from sight, every senses place her alone in her environment.
Vulnerable, yet protected and lively, she channels this liveliness into her fantasies and re-immerses herself in her environment through imagination.
As Gina is getting her reparative surgery, we can begin to spot other values that will be driving the plot: disappointment, disillusions, growing expectations, but more than anything: a woman's ascension to power.,
Just as teenage girls grow into womanhood by discovering the power of seduction that they been granted by this society's values, Gina will be living a renewed teenage-hood, in one of those unbalanced ways.
The makeshift inability of her partner to follow in all this excitement can only be explained in one way:
the choice was made to promote extroversion and stigmatize introversion, to promote promiscuity and stigmatize sobriety.
the most unreliable male characters are glorified as consumption products which Gina will follow in avidly.
in contrast, what would be her most reliable partner becomes a distrustful, manipulative and admonished dummy she systematically leaves behind in order to satisfy her desires by herself.
This could have been a remarkable baseline for illustrating how the individual commonly fails to care about the couple,
how people fail at sincerity and intimacy, how they fail at promotion and renunciation, how they focus on profit and aesthetics and forget to build anything deep.
Unfortunately you're about an hour in to the movie, and it is all downhill from there."
" Terrible script , great looking - but depressing twisted nonsensical story
",2018-01-20 00:00:00,4,"This is a strange film as it is well acted with high production value and some superb locations but the characters have very few redeeming qualities and it ends up being a super depressing twisted dull story that falters at every act.I saw it with an open mind and the cool artsy directing shots that are blurry to show life through a blind woman eyes are refreshing at first but get old quickly and hit you over the head. Yes we realize she is blind but the audience is not and the story matters or at least provide more depth to the characters and story to make us sympathize with them. Instead the story goes in a very predictable and yet bizarre sexual direction and moves from a happy dependent marriage to suddenly she recovers her eyesight and wants to explore and be sexy and tie up her husband, watch peep shows and eventually have sex with the pool guy with a huge member. What? As much as I like Blake Lively, one feels disconnected and un sympathetic for the main female character, and almost for both of these total depressing freaks. Blake's character could have gone in so many directions instead of this dark road alienating her husband...and the ending is strange and twisted. Yes we realize the husband wants his co dependent blind wife back and even willing.. spoiler.. to change her eye drops so she loses her sight again to regain his docile submissive dependent wife... but in some ways you almost feel like she was a more suitable partner as a blind woman because she was in love with him. Love is Blind. And as a WOman with Eye Sight... she has she turned into. Yes the crazy Spanish guy that is far from funny in this film says it all. She falls for another guy. ..... it is almost like writer wanted to say.. New WOman falls for Alpha male with large member and crazy loud sex or willing to punch any man to protect his woman - is her ideal partner for Ex Blind woman. It makes one think what really inspire the writer to write this twisted story ... while one suffers through this long drawn out pathetic story. Is there a deeper meaning that got lost in the editing room or did the writer really write something this terrible.And the worst part is that i read it was done for 30 million and the production value is def on the screen... but without a solid story/script a film always falls apart. It is still worth watching the film yet be prepared for a depressing drawn out movie. Kudos to the DP and Director/Producers for trying to make it come together and of course the actors did a wonderful job. I rate it a 4 as a 5 is too high for the painful long arse boring depressing script with even worse ending possible. Almost was hoping the husband would hit a truck and be blinded.. now that would have been stupendous ending."
" Nothing makes any sense!
",2018-01-19 00:00:00,3,"This Movie sounded like it would be something new and interesting, if they would use the theme they wanted to set!
This Movie is more like a riddle because nothing is really clear about anything...
It doesnt really want to go anywhere and just keeps on going for 1:40 hours! Im even sorry for my self that i sat through this!
The recovery process is better made than in most movies to see what she sees on the eye that is recovering!
but the story goes only towards recovering and than stops becoming any kind of story and you need to puzzle through what is happening!
It felt more like a Childbook with no interesst in character or story, it feels just thrown togeher and in the end it doesnt even matter!"
" Underwhelming end product as well as a misfire
",2018-01-19 00:00:00,5,"I only came to the knowledge of this film's existence by browsing through Blake Lively's IMDB page, and was frankly shocked to see the unbelievably low number of votes (in the 600s at this time). Even more so, I was flabbergasted when I saw that this film carries a production budget of $30M and only managed less than $1M in its limited theatrical run. Usually these numbers indicate a huge bomb caused by universal dislike from the critics and the general audience, but judging by the ridiculously small amount of votes here, the complete lack of exposure of any kind it indicates, and the mediocre scores, this is also not the case. Curious, I watched this film, and now I think I can see why.All I See Is You is an underwhelming film with a weak story and is also a creative misfire, in the sense that it does not present itself in any way as a coherent package with a clearly defined target audience. As a drama film, the film's mainstream appeal is clearly far from wide, and it isn't anywhere close to being experimental or avant-garde (not to mention no sane producer/investor would greenlight a arthouse production at even 1/10 of the budget of this one). Narratively the story is loosely written with a slow pace (especially in the beginning) that doesn't allow the film to gather much momentum. When the screen isn't showing you a scene that's clearly a part of the main storyline, I couldn't even ascertain if what I was watching was going to be developed into a subplot, or if it's just a random scene depicting a random minutiae that fills the screen time. I did not watch this movie expecting that I'd be hugely entertained, but it should have been obvious to the filmmakers that intercutting narratively unimportant scenes with random flashbacks is clearly insufficient to keep the audience interested, when the main storyline is so thin. When moments of drama finally arrive, they lack the originality, or the creative punch that comes with a well thought-out, well executed plot point, to really surprise and satisfy viewers. There's hardly any momentum building as the story progresses, which explains the lack of tension I felt when the film reached its supposed climax.Visually, this film simply contains too many shots where the cinematographer seems to be trying very hard to bring to the screen the blind girl's view of the world, all in a very impressionist and therefore distracting manner. In my opinion this was overkill, and it ended up creating an overall look that's more gimmicky than beautiful.It also conveyed a sense of alienation to me, as it made me want to talk to the screen, 'hey, I'm not blind, that's why I'm watching this, so could you please stop showing me what the world may seem from the blind girl's perspective (not to mention that that perspective should be pitch blackness if she was really blind) show me something that's actually interesting, like the actual story.'Instead, one can edit out all the shots of this type in this film, put them together, and you'd get a fine contender for ""32 potentially interesting short clips for my Windows OS screensaver"" or ""video to play on the big screen at a Blur concert"". It wears off rather quickly and becomes tedious after the initial novelty. I also find that parts of the soundtrack to be at odds to what the scenes were trying to portray.With a medium sized budget for a drama film at $30M (which means the producers were obviously expecting a wide theatrical release and for the film to not be a flop for that kind of release, in order to stand a chance at turning a profit), some of these creative decisions are simply baffling.In fact, you can go check the production budget for most of 2017's Oscar bait films, like 3 Billboards, Lady Bird, The Shape of Water etc, and these films all have roughly the same level of production budget as All I See Is You. It really is mind-boggling. I'm not saying the end product is too generic. In fact, I do suspect that, had the film been made in a more by-the-book standard Hollywood fashion, it likely would have gotten a better result.Well, it can hardly get worse than the current situation, where the box office is practically negligible against the costs. I still find it really hard to believe the number of votes here, which suggests that practically nobody except those who literally came across it/stumbled upon it have seen this, which is quite ridiculous, and as a Blake Lively fan, I don't even know how she would feel about accepting this role as the follow up to 2016's surprise hit The Shallows.I get it that the very idea of 'what if a blind girl recovers her sight somehow, and discovers that the world isn't quite as she thought it was' is a novel one and has potential, but that idea ALONE can only support a short film, granted it can be a very interesting 15 minute vignette if done well. The filmmakers simply failed to expand on the central premise here, and what we get is a feature length film that is a bore to sit through."
" watching paint dry is more exciting
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,2,"There's nothing going on in this movie, no plot, no story , nothing, from start to finish is just boring. don't waster your time."
" All I See is You (2017)
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,5,"Time to tell you how bad this film is. I didn't know much about it but I really like Blake Lively. Ever since the Gossip Girl days I've been interested in seeing more of her. The Shallows might be ridiculous at times but she's good in it and does show effort to her role. The same can be said for her commitment to this film, however its a shame everything else about this film lets her down. Its definitely a ""what the hell did I just watch"" film.The film is about a woman who is blind and has surgery to repair her vision. Once this happens her husband starts realizing that she knows about how attractive and appealing she is and becomes concerned with their marriage falling apart and her being pulled out towards other relationships. That's really whats going on. Along the way she starts losing her sight again along with her relationship. And then there's a what the heck moment with an incredibly stupid ending.The film does a good job of portraying eye popping visuals for what Lively's character sees when she is blind. The foggy, ever changing, and almost psychedelic visuals of her vision are quite nice to look at. As mentioned earlier Lively is good in this, but everyone in this film is unlikable. Lively's character isn't worth redeeming, Jason Clarke' s character is mysterious, like was he even good or bad? There's a lot of weird awkward moments dialogues about dicks and a very weirdly creepy brother in law. Yikes.I want to say there was potential here but about twenty minutes in you realize that its just wasted time. I want to see Lively in something better with a good filmmaker to bat. This is just a frustratingly bad experience because we have a frustrating director at the helm. Its quite stupid at times, you may want to check it out to see if you can form a different more positive opinion about it. Honestly though, its better to not ""see"" this one.5/10"
" Psychological marriage drama... ""We don't really know who me is, do we?""
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,6,"""All I See Is You"" (2017 release; 110 min.) brings the story of Gina and James, a married couple. As the movie opens, we are told it's ""Bangkok, Thailand"", and the couple is making love, trying to conceive. In the next few moments, we understand that Gina is legally blind, following a horrific car crash. She can't see more than a blur of light (and the camera shows us what that's like). But then, wonderful news! The eye car clinic tells her they can restore sight to her right eye. After the operation, Gina indeed gains eyesight. But now problems arise in the marriage nevertheless (or because so?). At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Mark Forster, who previously brought us ""Moster's Ball"" and ""World War Z"", among others. Here he goes in in different direction: what is life like when you unexpectedly regain your eyesight? and how does it affect personal relationships? The movie leaves us guessing for a long time how it really is unfolding, and that's fine. The first part of the movie focuses on the sensation of regaining eyesight (""I just want to see colors"", says Gina), while the second part focuses on the marriage issues between Gina and James (sorry, can't say more so as not to spoil), Blake Lively, whom we saw lat year in ""Cafe Society"" and the far better than expected ""The Shallows"", takes the movie on her shoulders and is absolutely tops. Jason Clark as the husband is fine. The movie's photography is eye-candy. I've never been to Bangkok and didn't quite realize how sophisticated a metropolis it is. The scenes in southern Spain and in Barcelona are equally eye-candy.""All I See Is You"" premiered at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, yes, over a year ago. No idea why it has taken this long to finally get a proper theater release. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 10 people in total) and that is not a good sign. I can only speak for myself obviously, but I quite enjoyed this psychological marriage drama, even if things (or perhaps just because) aren't always quite clear. I'd suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
" not much to see here
",2017-10-26 00:00:00,5,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Marc Forster has crafted a career of making movies that are readily watchable, though for the most part, not especially memorable. These include: FINDING NEVERLAND, STRANGER THAN FICTION, QUANTUM OF SOLACE, WORLD WAR Z, and his best film, MONSTER'S BALL (2001). His latest falls short of those, but thanks to Blake Lively and some creative visuals, we remain interested enough.This is Ms. Lively's follow up to last year's surprise summer hit THE SHALLOWS, her nearly one-woman sea-based spectacle. This time out she does an admirable job of carrying the film in spite of script flaws. It's co-written by Sean Conway and director Forster, and despite teasing some fascinating psychological aspects, we find ourselves constantly waiting for the movie to show us what we already know is about to happen. Predictability is rarely an asset for a film, and here it acts as a ball and chain to the pacing.The first third of the film works to establish two things: what Gina's (Lively) daily life is like as a blind person, and the type of relationship she and her husband (Jason Clarke) have. We get an abundance of distorted light flashes to simulate what she has lived with since the car accident that took away her parents and her vision during childhood. Her marriage finds her very dependent on her husband and Clarke's character thrives on this  even giving brief glimpses of his demented personality that will eventually take over the film in the final act.Gina's doctor (Danny Huston) performs a transplant which successfully restores her vision. The bulk of the story revolves around the changes that vision brings to her life and how the marriage begins disintegrating. The best message here is what happens to a relationship as the individuals change and evolve. Specifically in this case, the wife gains an entirely new perspective, while the husband longs for the days where she was dependent on him.At times it feels as if director Forster is working hard to create the look and feel of an experimental movie, rather than focusing on the story. There are some interesting visuals provided by locations and camera angles, although the moody atmosphere never really clicks. Ms. Lively singing ""Double Dutch"" provides an ending that is both odd and mesmerizing in a strange way. We are reminded that evil and self-centeredness can take on many forms, though this film never quite packs the dramatic punch it should."
" All I see is a mediocre film
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,5,"Marc Forster has delivered some decent big budget films in the past, like World War Z and Quantum of Solace, but All I See is You is smaller and a less epic offering. The story is an interesting one, a woman who has been blind for a long time has a procedure to get her eyesight back. The recovery period is long but ultimately successful in helping her gain her eyesight back, but she slowly starts realizing her life is not at all what it seems. I thought the cast did a fine job, Blake Lively played a blind woman quite well and Jason Clarke played her supportive yet angry husband.The problem with this movie is that nothing really happens, it tried to hit the viewer with a couple twists but those ultimately fell flat. Another problem was that it tried to use sex to further the narrative but that really just got in the way and felt forced. Maybe Marc was trying to distract the viewer with sex so they don't realize his movie is boring. A sort of plus was the handful of cool visuals that were scattered throughout the film, I won't tell you what they are because I don't really know how to explain them and if you choose to see it, I don't want to give anything away.My Suggestion: See it if you like Blake Lively or Jason Clarke enough to sit through a boring movie starring them.Seen at TIFF 2016."
