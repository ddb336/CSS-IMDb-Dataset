" You can be a human, or a killer of humans, but not both.
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,7,"Pierce Brosnan is back in the spy game, and proves to be in good form, in this adaptation of the novel ""There Are No Spies"" by Bill Granger. Brosnan plays Peter Devereaux, a.k.a. ""The November Man"". He's a former C.I.A. agent recruited back into service when an associate (Mediha Musliovic) turns up with information that incriminates a Russian politician (Lazar Ristovski) running for President. Although it hardly needs to be said, not everything in the developing scenario is how it appears to be. Much violence ensues is Devereaux is pitted against a former protegee, David Mason (Luke Bracey) who doesn't always follow orders to the letter.The cat-and-mouse game between Devereaux and Mason is one solid element of this engaging, if not exemplary, example of the international-intrigue action-thriller genre. Fortunately, filmmaker Roger Donaldson, reunited with Brosnan 17 years after ""Dante's Peak"", guides this entertaining story in style. The use of various Serbian and Montenegro locations is first-rate, the violence is pretty intense, the women are gorgeous, Brosnan is backed up by a strong supporting cast, and the pace remains pretty consistent. Adding some gravitas is the context of the tale, involving old war crimes in Chechnya. Now, the story IS predictable more often than not, and it does traffic in some cliches, but while it's playing out for a reasonably exciting 109 minutes, most viewers likely won't mind a lot. Bracey is fine as the young agent out to prove himself, Olga Kurylenko is appealing as the imperiled Alice Fournier, Amila Terzimehic is amusing as a relentless hitwoman, and American veteran actors Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton do credible jobs as a jovial colleague and a cold-eyed, bureaucratic senior agent.""The November Man"" is good fun: maybe not a classic that will be remembered years from now, but it does show its audience a pretty good time overall.Seven out of 10."
" Based on a very bad idea...
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,1,Buying the copyrights of a book so you can star in a movie based on it is not a good idea if you're not that great of an actor and has no idea how to adapt it to fit the silver screen.
" Good action spy thriller
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,9,Good story line with interesting plot twists. Excellent acting all around and nice action pace. Overall a very entertaining spy thriller.
" A great performance by Brosnan, but the film is brought down by a muddled plot
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,7,"In a weird way, ""The November Man"" has a special place in my heart, as I vividly remember going to see the movie with my mother in theatres, all the way back in 2014 when it released (7 years ago, at the time of this writing). My mother, a Pierce Brosnan fan, and myself, a spy film enthusiast, had a fun time watching the movie together - and we haven't seen it since. Now, jump to 2021, and I decided it was time to give ""The November Man"" another watch. Does it hold up to my happy memories, or is it a worse film than I wanted to originally admit?""The November Man,"" starring Pierce Brosnan and Luke Bracey, is a lot of things - but the first word that comes to mind is ""entertaining."" Not once did I find myself bored while watching this film; that's not to say the movie doesn't have its flaws. But let's start with the good: Pierce is flat-out great in this movie. And that's not surprising, as he's played the role of a badass secret agent before. However, in this movie, Brosnan has some grit to him, at points getting darker than you might expect, which adds some layers to his character that are enjoyable to watch. Olga Kurylenko is also good in this movie, and as gorgeous as ever. She has some vulnerable moments that can be interesting to watch, and she shares a large amount of screen time with Brosnan, and together they chew up the scenery. They have good chemistry, and it helps that the both of them are top notch actors.Action-wise, there are some fun sequences in the movie. A lot of the action seems to lack impact, and that may be because of the use of noticeably fake blood (occasionally, when someone gets shot, blood squirts 15 feet into the air, and it kind of broke my immersion). However, there are enough cat-and-mouse chase scenes, slick getaways, explosions, and Brosnan-induced headshots to hold your interest throughout the film.We talked pros, now let's talk cons. Besides Brosnan and Kurylenko, every other actor in this movie is, well, not good. Overacting, underacting, you name it, ""The November Man"" has it - Luke Bracey was perhaps the worst offender. Nothing against Luke Bracey, but he was terribly wooden in this movie, never conveying enough emotion when needed, and spewing ""badass"" lines on a constant basis that probably sounded better on paper than they did through someone's mouth. The dialogue in this movie is so cringey, akin to something out of the Bourne movies, without the acting chops to make them passable. There were times I found myself wincing because of how bad the script was - and speaking of the script, narrative cohesion is another problem ""The November Man"" displays.Like I said earlier, you get a darker, grittier Pierce in this movie - at times. You see, ""The November Man"" is filmed with a very convoluted plot, packing in so many plot points that by the time they show Brosnan's character as a potential anti-hero, the thread is introduced and resolved within five minutes. And when I say, ""resolved,"" I mean that this particular story-arc happened, and was never brought up ever again. Instead, the movie pivots course, focusing on governmental betrayal, the East versus the West, political power struggles, and more, all on top of a young spy going up against his mentor. I mean seriously, the ""Spy versus Spy"" theme the trailer advertises is just a quarter of this movie's story - why wasn't it the entire film? There is so much different stuff packed into this movie that every plot is basically gasping for breath, as none of them get adequate breathing room. I don't know about you, but a tight, taut thriller about a hardened, older ex-secret agent who's forced to fight his mentee sounds like a damn exciting film in its own right - I only wish ""The November Man"" agreed.This film is carried by the performances of Brosnan and Kurylenko, and is glued together with genuinely fun to watch action scenes. However, the generic, overly-convoluted plat proves to be a major hindrance to the overall quality of the film. That said, I never found myself bored or actively disliking my viewing experience, which is why I conclude that ""The November Man"" is a perfectly watchable and entertaining film, if a disappointing one as well."
" Way better
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,10,"Than the reviews keeping this in the red.
Watch and see why it deserves to be in the green."
" Not bad but not great
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,6,"November Man is a pretty run of the mill movie, it has the often used plot element of someone who comes out of retirement for one last job/mission. The action sequences aren't bad and the acting is good but as for the movie as a whole it's all been done before yet it still manages to entertain."
" If you like spy movies, it's your loss if you skip this one
",2020-11-26 00:00:00,8,"Stop reading the reviews already, and just start watching the movie. It's a solid one, and chances are you'll wonder what the negative reviewers really watched and how tired or something they were when they watched it."
" Sometimes critics are a**holes
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,8,I don't know what was wrong with the cut of this movie that they reviewed but it wasn't the one I watched. It wasn't an Oscar contender but it's good solid entertainment. Maybe the problem that the critics had was that you have to pay attention and they were too busy writing to actually watch the movie?
" Not bad
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,2,"All 007 movies have a common method: he saves a girl and sleeps with her, it is not worth the action movie, just this"
" Not for simple minded people
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,9,The story builds and has important twists. Plot is easy to follow if you are paying attention.
" SERIOUSLY THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,9,"No ideal why the low ratings other than people are clueless, this was a really good to watch, even pace great acting and believable, much better than the James Bond movies of the last ten years.
Brosnan show he's one of the best male actors of all time"
" Nothing like a Bond movie, and in this case that's a good thing...
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,8,"I never quite bought Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, but then again I grew increasingly tired of the whole color by numbers Bond movies with each new release. Casino Royale and Daniel Craig gave me hope, but that was short-lived ...But this ISN'T a James Bond movie, and that's a good thing. November Man isn't a Jason Bourne movie either, and that's a better thing. What it is though is a much more believable story where the actors are allowed to be human beings instead of one dimensional cartoon characters or superheroes. That's not a knock against the Bourne flicks, they're great action thrillers, but November Man is a different sort of movie altogether. There's a decent amount of action, but just like in real life the car chases don't go on forever, gunfights are sudden and often surprising, and fight scenes are short, brutal, and painful.One way of putting it would be to say this is a spy/covert ops movie for grown-ups. There's plenty of tension even if you see one of the two main plot twists coming as I did, in fact that adds to the tension. Of course it's not 'realistic' either, no one would watch a realistic spy movie because it would be so boring the screenwriters would fall asleep before finishing the first scene. November Man has what I judge to be a good blend of intrigue, action, and interesting characters. And because the two main characters are believable with room to grow both personally and in their not so amicable relationship, a sequel or three might have been equally entertaining.If you're expecting a suave James Bond spy in the style of Connery (the REAL James Bond), Moore, or Brosnan you'll want to give this a pass, but if the grittier Bond that Craig gave us in Casino Royale appeals to you, then do your self a favor and check this out."
" Cliché the movie.
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,3,A Jason Bourne rip off with none of the suspense. Full of twists and turns that I didn't care about. Stuffed with side characters that drag the story like an anchor. I only watched this because of the trailer tag line. They call him November man because after he comes nothing lives. Sounds sweet right? No it's lame.
" Worst spy movie ever
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,1,"Imagine you are attacking Russian politician and he has only 3 guards which were killed in a minute, and after this 10 CIA agents get there and none of the Russians... is it a joke or what"
" Mediocre spy movie
",2020-03-13 00:00:00,3,"This movie was at the same time completely unbelievable and highly predictable. The dialog was also very poor and the delivery didn't help.
Unless you are an absolute spy-movie fenatic I'd skipp this one."
" Better than the critics say ( B+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10
",2020-02-10 00:00:00,9,Don't listen the critics. The November Man is a good spy action/thriller and you should enjoy it especially if you liked Brosnan as a Bond back then.
" Overlooked Action Gem
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,8,Great spy movie-Brosnan is solid as always and Olga Korylenko is grade A eye candy. Enjoy.
" The Whole World's Sittin' on a Ticking Bomb
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,7,"A glossy post Cold War thriller with interesting geopolitical asides shot in Serbia in wobbly steadicam in which there are lots of car chases and explosions and plenty of people die messily; few of them, sadly, at the hands of sexy rival assassin Amila Terzimehic."
" Great performance from Pierce Brosnan
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,7,"The November Man confirms Brosnan's credentials as a great action man. This is almost a Bond movie. It lacks the budget though, almost all of the action taking place in one city. It has a European look about it, but when I think back as to why this doesn't quite make it into the big league Bond or Bourne, I think it is because the locations chosen were a little ordinary in comparison, and whilst at times it attempts to dazzle with a little savvy use of tech, in truth it's nothing we haven't seen for years now. The November Man is a good auctioneer, and worth a look. The story makes sense, the script is good, there's plenty of surprises, and you won't see everything coming for most of the movie. And all the actors perform really well. Some of the characters were classically dastardly too. It's far less ruthless that Bond or Bourne, indeed, that's part of the theme. And I think the soundtrack let it down a bit too, it lacked draw and punch. I hope Pierce Brosnan does more movies like this, hopefully as a far darker character."
" A V E R A G E and predictible - a waste if time...
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,4,The ideas for a story lasted until the half of the movie.... then it was a spagetti action movie ... a waste of time - I wish someone had warned me ...
" Everything dies
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,5,"The November Man feels like a reheated spy action film. A second rate Bond with some added touch of a John Le Carre conspiracy. It offers nothing much that is new or exciting.Peter Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan) is a CIA agent that called it quits in 2008 after a botched job when his young reckless protege Mason (Luke Bracey) shoots a child dead.Five years later Devereaux is brought out from the cold by his handler Hanley (Bill Smitrovich.) He has to protect a Russian informant who has the dirt on the next would be president of Russia, that he once plotted with the CIA.Events go south as the informant is killed. Devereaux now needs to unravel the conspiracy which might lead to his employers and is now hunted by a Russian assassin as well as Mason.There are shades of The Mechanic as Devereaux has to face off with the younger rival that he trained and who has taken his place at the agency. The film displays some appalling sexism. Hanley makes an off colour slur on a female that should had been left in the cutting room floor. Another female character has to don a gratuitous revealing costume to get near her mark.This is a thriller made on a modest budget. It is all shot in some East European country. There are enough action and thrills to make this a serviceable film with a few well worn twists. You just know that both Brosnan and director Roger Donaldson once made bigger budget and better films."
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,6,Not bad. Some good and some bad. Some cool and some lame. Some intriguing and some questionable. Overall entertaining and suspenseful with a decent story (1 viewing)
" How could you hate it
",2019-06-19 00:00:00,10,"This is a tout faced paced thriller. What not to like, a decent plot,amazing action sequence and fine acting by everyone.
A must see, kick the haters, go watch this movie."
" Brosnan Could Have Played An Older Bond
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,7,"I just watched this last night on TV, knowing nothing about it, except it starred Pierce BrosnanPlot in A Paragraph: Retired CIA agent Peter Deveroux (Brosnan) has been living in Switzerland peacefully for 5 years. His former boss arrives and asks him to help extract his friend Natalia Ulajova from Russia, as she has some evidence of war crimes against the President elect. However he soon finds himself up against the his last protege. A man he not only considers his best friend, but also the best he ever trained.
There is more too it than a protoge chasing a mentor, and Brosnan was great, and certainly liked the part (he so could have pulled off an older Bond for QT) although, there is a scene where he badly hurts an innocent person, which was unnecessary and out of character. I really didn't like it.The brilliant Will Patton is under used. Olga Kurylenko looks great, but is not really given a lot to do until late on. Likewise, Eliza Taylor who plays Sarah, the attractive neighbour/love interest of the protege.Certainly worth a one time watch."
" This looks like job for November man
",2019-05-31 00:00:00,9,This is a great action movie. It is very fast past. It has great story line. it also has very good acting. See this movie. It is a great movie. It one of the best movies ever. See it.
" Best Action Film Ever Made After Jason Bourne Series

" Great thriller
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,9,This movie just proves that Mr Brosnan could have continued as James Bond for a much longer. He is perfect in this role and the movie moves at a good pace towards a satisfying conclusion.
" Now the older generation has come out to make action movies
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,5,"007 is really old. Now the older generation has come out to make action movies, but also drunk. The front rhythm is good, the back part of the decryption is a bit of a tease, the rape is entirely meat steamed bun. Sure enough, Hollywood villains die of too much nonsense."
" Poor action movie
",2019-02-08 00:00:00,3,This action picture was meant to be à 007 alternative. But the scenario is simple.and easy to guess. You.always know what will happen the following minutes. The cast are not athletic. They hardly run in action's scene. It was à desapointment.
" A fine action thriller with an excellent cast
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,8,"An intelligent script, a highly realistic premise, good acting performances, good-looking female lead, exotic settings, political relevance, gunplay, car crashes, explosions, mounting tension. What else do you want? Some of the reviews of this movies are far out of line. If you like this sort of movie, you will like this one."
" Perfected Espionage Film
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,9,"27 August 2014. Bringing back the retro classic spy thriller, this taut, well-executed espionage movie retains the high razor-edged emotive tension of The Spy Who Came In From the Cold (1965), The Three Days of Condor (1975) or the more contemporary Page Eight (2011) or The Good Shepard (2006) without the overblown dependence on special effects, car chases, and over-extended fight sequences. Even with the excellent, well done spy movies such as Bourne Identity (2002), Salt (2010), The Assassin's Bullet (2011), this seriously portrayed espionage movie focuses instead on the raw brief gun battles, keeping the action simple and accomplished such as John Cusack in The Numbers Station (2013).Pierce Brosnan has ample experience in spy movies with his James Bond roles as well as The Matador (2002) and The Tailor of Panama (2001) and in this movie performs his character without smugness or flash. In some ways, his performance parallels that Daniel Craig in Casino Royale(2006) but in an even more believable role.The script is convoluted but intelligent with several groups attempted to stop Brosnan's character from fulfilling his mission. It has echoes of heart-pounding twisted high suspense found in Mission Impossible (1996), Enemy of the State (1998), Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (2011), and The Russia House (1990). The atmospheric tone and substantive air of The November Man are suggestive of Ryan Phillipe going up against Chris Cooper's character in Breach (2007), Robert Redford in Spy Game (2001),George Clooney in The American (2010)."
" Proves Brosnan had more Bond films in him!
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,9,"Brosnan is great in this movie and it sure proves that he had more Bond films in him! It is a good story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Well acted and directed throughout with great acting by all.
Why some gave negative reviews beats me."
" a theatre worthy movie goes direct to DVD
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that action stars especially stars that play James bond can slip in and out of Genres smoothly and make their way back. I am shocked and appalled that no one was willing to release this to theatres so it had to be released direct to DVD because this was surprisingly good. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" smart action
",2018-10-30 00:00:00,7,"'The November Man' was a pleasant surprise. Spy action movies rely very often on a combination of shadowy international intrigue, choreographed violence and sex in order to attract their specific audiences. The quality of the film directed by Roger Donaldson derives from the fact that its script is better written than the majority of other similar movies, the characters and situations are credible, and there are no big holes of gaffes in the story. A rare case of John Le Carre meeting James Bond if you wish.The hero of the film, Peter Devereax (Pierce Brosnan, who was James Bond for only two movies before being replaced by Daniel Craig) is a retired CIA spy who tries to live as normal a life as retired spies can live. He has a soft spot in his biography which is not known even by his former employers, and when he will be brought back in action for a mission which only he can accomplish, he will become part of a violent drama in which are involved his former bosses and colleagues, and which puts at risk not only his life but also the ones of the beings he loves mostly. The story takes place in Moscow and the Balkans after the fall of the Communism, and the dilemmas faced by the hero are very much similar to the ones faces by the heroes of the novels of John Le Carre: conflicts of generations and values in the spy organizations, loyalty of the 'old boys' to the principles of the war between good and evil and nostalgia for times when the enemy was better defined and known, sacrifices that are required in the personal lives and the immense difficulty to live 'normally'.The fans of action movies will not be disappointed either. There is plenty of action, car chases and shootings which will make them happy. Acting is good, Pierce Brosnan does well his job both in the action scenes as well as when his hero is faced with tough choices, with good replicas from the rest of the team and especially from Olga Kurylenko and Luke Bracey. The weakest part of the film is in my opinion the stereotypical presentation of the Balkans and of the Russians. There may be an excuse in the fact that the story is based on a hero and book series created by Bill Granger in the 1980s and 1990s. A lot has changed since then in the world and in the way spy novels and spy movies scripts are written, and a more nuanced update would have been appropriate for a film made in 2014. Yet, it's a well written, acted and paced movie which is better than the crowd."
" Engaging Star Chemistry in one of the best spy action thrillers of recent years
",2018-10-09 00:00:00,8,"Roger Donaldson best directorial effort since 'No Way Out'. Pierce Brosnan has made some worthy political espionage intrigue movies over the years (apart from the Bond movies, The Foreigner and The Tailor Of Panama immediately come to mind) but this one stands up as high as any of them. Olga Kurylenko adds her personal magnetism in large degrees. A well fleshed out constantly twisting storyline with high suspense value, this movie successfully combines good formulaic qualities injected with originality, adding up to great entertainment in my opinion. This is a standout movie of the genre. Deserves a far higher rating then given on this site, which is always a good reason for me to write a review. Highly recommended."
" WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU?
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,8,"Peter Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan) is a super spy, retired. He worked for the CIA and trained David Mason (Luke Bracey). A former Russian General named Federov (Lazar Ristovski) is poised to become Russia's next president. A woman who was next to him under deep cover has damaging information on Federov and wants to be extracted. Peter shows up from out of retirement to help out...things go awry.Peter now needs to find a girl (Olga Kurylenko) who has the information before the Russians or CIA do, as both want her dead. David, who was trained by Peter, is part of the CIA that wants him dead, although he has mixed loyalties. The film is interesting as Peter stays one step ahead of David as he knows how he was trained. The question as to why the CIA wants people dead is a mystery that is revealed 44 minutes into the film. The name ""November Man"" is explained 8 minutes from the end of the film or the first 10 seconds of the preview. Amila Terzimehic plays a Russian assassin whose role I would have loved to have seen expanded.Alice: "" Do all of your friends try to kill you?""
Peter: ""Eventually.""An interesting spy thriller, a bit formulaic, but worth a view.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, and of course stripper nudity."
" Classic shootem' up flick
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,7,"The storyline was solid, action sublime, and twist at the end was gold.More movies need to have this chemistry and stick to what makes a movie like this good."

" Very fine - complex but not too much so - great performance by Brosnan
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,8,"The first thought is ""Another James Bond?"" In physicality, yes, certainly. Brosnan is in amazing shape - and just as active, energetic, ferocious as in any Bond. In terms of special effects, no this is a more serious and grounded movie than any Bond. Unlike the James Bond films, this deals with quite serious real-world issues - loosely based on headlines from Bosnia-Hercegovina and Russia in recent decades. The movie is deeply suspenseful, fast-paced, complicated (but you can follow), very well- acted - but most of all it's a superb Piece Brosnan as a truly world-weary, cynical, older, former secret agent - pulled back into the game. - and vicious antagonists. The Bond girl is an excellent co-star!You'll like it! I hope there are more with Brosnan's character - remember the name, Devereux!"
" cameraman drunk?
",2018-05-05 00:00:00,1,I couldn't get thru the first scene.... the actors were sitting at a table and the camera was shaking like it was an 9 degrees earthquake.
" A bit 'digital' at times, but otherwise enjoyable
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,6,"THE NOVEMBER MAN is another tough-guy vehicle for Pierce Brosnan, who has been really excelling in the thriller genre when taken out of his overblown Bond movies. Here he plays an assassin forced to do battle with his own protege when a corrupt Russian politician brings chaos to Europe. The film marks a re-teaming for Brosnan and director Roger Donaldson after their excellent DANTE'S PEAK and while it's not as good as that movie, this isn't bad at all. The main problem I had with it is that it has a cheap, digital look at times and the use of CGI blood and the like is pretty poor. Otherwise, this is a compelling BOURNE-style story with narrative that's complex enough to keep you watching. Brosnan is as smooth and suave as ever and Australian actor Luke Bracey does well in support. There's also a fine turn from the surprisingly good Olga Kurylenko, who is better here than she ever was in QUANTUM OF SOLACE."
" Everybody Spies Once In A While.
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,5,"You can generally tell how closely an action movie adhered to generic conventions by how long it takes to get to the first high-speed pursuit. The car chase here begins at about the twenty minute mark. Strictly routine.Pierce Brosnan is a retired CIA agent who is called back to duty by his nationalist fervor and his high moral sense. Another CIA agent, by whom Brosnan has had a daughter, has been uncovered by the Russkies and must be saved. Brosnan doesn't succeed in his mission. The woman is seated next to him in a car when her chest is punctured by a bullet from a distant rifle. The man who fired the bullet is Luke Bracey, a young CIA man who is just following orders and who was trained to do so by Brosnan in his earlier incarnation.A feud now exists between them. It's cat and mouse. It's eye for eye. It's tooth for tooth. It's quid for quo. It's two for a penny.The feud adds tension but the tension is misplaced because the REAL villains aren't those whom you might expect. I won't give away their identities except to say that one is Bill Smitrovich, the CIA chief in Belgrade, where the story takes place; the other is Lazar Ristovski, a candidate for president of the Russian confederation. They get their just desserts.The principals in the movie stay in the elegant Hotel Imperial in Belgrade. I stayed in Belgrade for a while, too, but in the cheapest shabbiest hotel I could find. I developed these tiny red lesions which my companion, a medical student, claimed looked like insect bites. One night, in the course of rolling over, I happened to glance at the pillow where half a dozen bed bugs had nestled under my head. Now, I don't just offer this as a colorful anecdote but as a prelude to some advice of momentous importance: If you must stay in Belgrade, stay in the Hotel Imperial.Brosnan is okay, and Olga Kurylenko is positively magnetic, what with her plump lips and startling periwinkle blue irises. Luke Bracey is a good-enough looking young man. He looks like a movie star. But his delivery is pale and weak. Lazar Ristovski does a good job as the corrupt sex maniac who starts the Chechin War. Smitrovich is so repulsive in every respect that he, or his bald presence, seems to infect the screen. Amila Terzimehic is a hit woman who has had ballet training and whose nose is as long and threatening as her pistol, the one with the lengthy noise suppressor attached. It's confusing, filled with action, and violently routine."
