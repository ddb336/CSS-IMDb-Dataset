" Really good
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,9,"I took off a star for the teen at the end who was scared to swim 20 feet out of the bomb shelter after spending hours in the water. All of a sudden he was so frozen with fear to even move? What the hell? That made no sense and his idiocy almost cost his father his life.
Other than that head scratching scene, and those idiots who worked at the control office surviving because they were high on the mountain, I liked it. I would've loved to have seen the idiot blond woman in the control office get slammed by the wave because she was not believing the tsunami was coming, and this was what her job is supposed to be! And when she realized that it was coming, she hesitates all weepy and dramatically to sound the alarm button for the town to have warning. Silly ignorant, over emotional woman...and she lives. Ugh!"
" One of the Best Disaster Movies
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,10,"Everything seemed so real. The pace was pretty fast. It goes to show, listen to the expert and in this case, your intuition. I had to watch this with English subtitles since the audio was in Norwegian but I didn't mind since the quality of the movie was so good and realistic. This seems to be a warning to anyone living in this area or one like it."
" Good movie
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,6,Overall a good movie. The only reason I gave a 6/10 it's because it was a little slow at the begining. It took more than 40mins till the real action began. At the end of the movie I think the protagonist should had died. It wasn't as dramatic as disaster movies shall be.
" Excellent!!!
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,8,"Excellent natural disaster movie, at least on a par with its American counterparts. Understandably, it was a smash hit in Norway. The natural disaster it predicts is within the realms of possibility. Something, quite worse than thathat hit Alaska in 1958."
" Too much ""family drama""
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,5,"When I watch a ""disaster movie"" I expect entertainment above all else. But that is just me. In this regard however, the movie fails, and it does so because it's no Hollywood. This is what Wave is lacking: star power- charismatic leads, memorable and/or funny one-liners, humour, camp, dramatic build up... all the things that make Hollywood movies universally appealing and fun.The actors here are all unpleasant to look at, charmless, and again, I would like to see a disaster flick without children in it (or family drama of any kind). The build up to the actual disaster is extremeley long and boring to death.Then, what is really annoying is how incredibly stupidly and Slowly everyone acts. The woman in the early learning center waits for another minute to push the alarm, even after the mountain starts collapsing. Get on with it, stupid! They all stare at the data, warnings everywhere, and assume there's an error. What's the point of having all that equipment then? Why would the blonde need to knock on every door inside the hotel wasting precious time? Doesn't every adult know that when an alarm sounds in the middle of the night, you just get out immediately? And the stupidity goes on and on.One good thing about the movie is the beautiful scenery, Norway is indeed breathtaking."
" Disaster Movie not with Gerard Butler
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,6,"482. The Wave. Is it wrong to say that a disaster movie is fun? Hell no, that's right! It's a fun disaster flick! And it's really pretty to look at, great scenery of the little Norwegian town where the movie takes place, even when the CGI wave kicks in looks pretty good, even after the wave sends the town into it's own little apocalypse, it's still pleasant to look at. Spoiler alert a giant wave comes and wipes out a small town, not that the cover art gives that away or anything... Story revolves around Science Guy and his last day of work at the Science Station where they monitor mountains along a lakeside town. Apparently, Norway is a giant rock and it falls apart constantly and it's especially dangerous around large bodies of water when the rocks fall and create tsunamis. And wouldn't you know it, on his last day Science Guy finds something that leads him to believe that's about to happen, his co-workers roll their eyeballs and say they'll keep a good watch, now get outta here!! So he relents, maybe it's nothing, goes home to his family, helps them pack the house up, all the while he knows somethings up, taking his time packing, pissing off the rest of em... The next day just as he's about to head out of town on the ferry with the kids... wife has gotta finish up her last shift at the local hotel... Science Guy is like something is wrong and turns around, decides to check things out, drops son off with mom at work, takes daughter to old house, to do some research and wouldn't you know it, in his pull out books and all leads to one conclusion scene, it happens!! Rocks slide, water rises tsunami about to come to town in 10 minutes!! And things get pretty exciting!! Mom and son get trapped in a rapidly flooding hotel. Science Guy and daughter have to race up a mountain road to get to the high ground!! Just like Obi Wan did to Anakin!! Turns out, besides being a great Science Guy and father, he's a freakin' hero too!! Definitely worth the watch for the Disaster Movie genre fan. It is quite predictable (Gerard Butler is not in it!), however it's still a fun and exciting watch! Spoilers: Science Guy returns for the sequel: The Quake. I wonder what happens in that one???

" original subject, terrible cliché ..
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,3,"In this show there are some people who dont fear to watch the 80-meter wave that is coming on, are cool enough to stop running and chat when he sees his friend when he should have forgotten his God, achieve to stuck somewhere in one way or another, in the moment of a disaster. cheap heroism born of these people. whereas the show had given hope. Unfortunately, it was very difficult to finish this movie. Long story short, it might be a snack movie at most."
" Randy Marsh moves to Norway
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,1,"How else to explain all the inept geologists.Yet that's besides the point, really, since even the best seismic gear, operated by the world's foremost scientists, and portrayed by the world's greatest actors, could not put this tripe over on anyone with a functioning brain.It's just CGI garbage with Norse dialog. There isn't a single believable or original scene in this mess. Everything has been done before and to death by Hollywood. I mean, nobody outruns a tsunami. I don't care what language you speak.These low-rent disaster movies play all the time on various low-rent Canadian movie channels. They're usually filmed in Abbotsford or Chilliwack and star a bunch of nobodies. Go straight to cable. Give the British Columbia government an excuse to give tax breaks and direct subsidies to film crews. And uniformly blow.My guess is it works the same way in Norway.,"
" Bloody good
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,8,This treat harks back to the golden age of disaster in terms of character development . There are the menacing rumbles of impending doom but this doesn't overshadow the richness of the sub plot and builds characters you care about. Its we
" Really enjoyed this film
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,7,"Pleasantly surprised . Good film. Subtitles s, but kept me on edge of my seat and interested whole time. Absolutely beautiful scenery!"
" Pretty realistic, until it isn't
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,7,"To start with: IMDB, this is NOT a about a 'mountain pass' collapsing. The pass is the place people try to flee to.It is about the Åkneset MOUNTAIN, which one can find to the northwest of Geiranger, about 30 kilometers away.What appealed to me is the quite realistic setting. Such ruptures DO exist in mountains, and ARE monitored, and tsunami's CAN result, and HAVE been disastrous, and COULD be a real danger in this particular narrow fjord. I guess there is even a real rupture along the Geiranger-fjord, as stated in the end titling.Even the mentioned Randa (Switzerland) is really a thing. There has been a very large landslide, though I wonder if that was comparable in cause.Also the psychology of the people is convincing. The hesitating scientists and their interaction. The denial by tourists, or the desire to pack their luggage. The panicking in the water, even the 'murder' by the mother. Though she was too unimpressed.The depiction of the wave is probably far too wild. The smashing of cars is imaginable. The honking of the fleeing people is to expect in such a situation.But where it really derailed was in the aftermath of the disaster.NO there will be NO scattered little FIRES after a TSUNAMI!! Incredible that this stupid Hollywood CLICHE was stamped onto this film. Very annoying to see that everywhere from that point on.It is also nonsensical to have a shelter in the BASEMENT, when the imminent threat is a tsunami. It is not a bad idea to have a sturdy closed off shelter to ride out the wave. But then as high as possible, and large enough to accommodate like the entire hotel.Though I understand there is nothing to film in pitch dark, I do sigh when light remains everywhere in the hotel, even under water.And finally, NO, one cannot hope for swimming pool grade clear water after a tsunami. (Again, yes, handy when filming underwater scenes.) One has to expect murky water full of junk.Probably 'Titanic' also adhered to the last 2 points.Seeing this seemed based on the real situation, made me hope the Norwegians actually have a real good plan. They can watch the movie how NOT to act."
" S-l-o-w!
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,2,"Ship this boring mess. If you must, FF to the hour mark. I had to turn it off. Not worth it."
" Not Hollywood, just brilliantly done.
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,9,"You know you are on the edge of your seat when you are shouting at the screen! This is not beyond the realms of possibility, this is something that could happen tomorrow. There are no big names, no big budget and it's a little predictable but I really enjoyed it. It had realism, just what you would expect to happen without the bells and whistles of a big Hollywood movie. this is just a simple, superbly made disaster movie."
" Great Disaster Movie
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,7,"The geologist Kristian Eikjord (Kristoffer Joner) works controlling the movements of mountains and fjords in Geiranger. He says goodbye to his colleagues since he is moving with his family to Stavanger to work in the oil industry. When he is leaving the station, he notes that two sensors indicate a strange movement of the underground water, intriguing him. While waiting for the ferry with his teenage son Sondre (Jonas Hoff Oftebro) and his little daughter Julia (Edith Haagenrud-Sande) to go to Stavanger, Kristian decides to return to the station. He goes by helicopter with his colleague Jacob (Arthur Berning) to investigate the sensors and they find the wires broken. When Jacob and his boss Arvid (Fridtjov Såheim) head to the place later to a further investigation, they discover that an avalanche will happen soon. Arvid orders to sound the warning alarm in Geiranger. Kristian with Julia hear the alarm, he calls his wife Idun (Ane Dahl Torp) that works in the local hotel and warns that Sondre and she should go to a higher place since a tsunami will come in a few minutes in Geiranger. What will the population do?""Bølgen"" is a great disaster movie, with good performances, special effects, and landscapes in Norway. The plot is believable, tense and engaging and holds the attention of the viewer until the very last scene. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Onda"" (""The Wave"")"

" Phenomenal disaster movie!! Great cast, must see!!
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,9,"This is a exceptional movie in all aspects of a disaster movie great story especially with where the world is now. How thinking more about the economy, tourists, retail, than thinking about safety. The let's not make people panic and then deal with the consequences because of that. This movie shows an important part of not panicking can be devastating . Like what covid-19 did to America, had the warning but didn't act because of money over safety. Watch this incredible movie and see a disaster happen right before your eyes. Wow, like a motion ride...."
" Good idea, bad acting
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,6,"It's an interesting story, but the acting and some of the scenes are like ""ah c'mon"". Very bad scenatio and unconvincing acting."
" Omg
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,10,Good acting suspence a good way to represent the real story
" Starts well and it's all downhill from there
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,3,"The premise is interesting, the mood for the impending disaster is set well... But once it finally happens... Turns into such a boring experience.
The characters make incredibly questionable and extremely dumb decisions that makes you feel like you're watching one of those horror movies with a bunch of half-naked teens falling right into the serial killer's hands.
But the worst sin of all... They manage to turn you against the protagonists (not the main character himself, but his family). You know... the people we were supposed to care about. Around 1 hour into the movie I actually wanted them to die, cause honestly, they deserved to at that point.
It does well portraing the disaster... If at least they had interesting character I'm sure it could be more enjoyable."
" Surprise
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,9,I was totally surprised by how thoroughly I enjoyed this film. It hit all the right disaster film buttons for me.
" Solid 7
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,7,"Well acted, good character development, solid story line. I enjoyed this film."
" Basic but exciting disaster movie
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,7,"Terrific Nordic disaster film from the very beginning to the very end it pulls out all the stops and shows you do not need a massive 100 million budget to make a taut and edge of the seat film.Excellent performances from all concerned, fantastic director who knows exactly what he is doing and some basic but exciting action sequences all building up to the climax which was amazing considering the budget.
If you are looking for something a bit different and akin to the old 70's movies like Towering Inferno and Earthquake then this will certainly tick all the boxes.
A very good 7 out of 10 stars from me on this one!"
" Great
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,8,Great disaster movie. They made it for $5 million dollars. Hollywood would cost $100 million.
" A Norwegian disaster flick (unlike Hollywood)
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,7,"There are not many Norwegian movies that I have seen. This was available Netflix. I watched this yesterday with family (again kids friendly movie) and found it to be a breath of fresh air.There are many Hollywood disaster movies we would have seen (Day after tomorrow / 2012 / Deep Impact / Twister / Dante's peak / Titanic / Volcano etc) so we are used to a certain amount of CGI special effects and American influence. I found this movie to have heart which clearly makes up for less CGI and non Hollywoodish (mostly!)The central characters did so well, I particularly liked the build up to the event without rushing to show the actual disaster. Script was unpretentious and addressed the-most important aspect of any disaster which is mitigation plans for the event and contingency during aftermath.Strongly recommend."
" Superior disaster film from Norway
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,8,"Geologist Kristian Elkjord (a fine and likeable performance by Kristoffer Joner) must keep his family safe from a giant tsunami wave that threatens to destroy a small coastal town.Director Roar Uthoag relates the engrossing story at a steady pace, generates a good deal of tension, takes time to develop the main characters, makes excellent use of the beautiful Norwegian countryside, stages the big wave hitting the burg with heart-racing aplomb, and thankfully keeps both sentiment and melodrama to a refreshing minimum. Moreover, the fact that the catastrophe featured in this film could possibly happen gives it an extra realistic and chilling edge. The sound acting from the capable cast rates as another substantial asset: Ane Dahl Torp as spunky wife Idun, Edith Haagenrud-Sande as cute daughter Julia, Jona Hoff Oftebro as moody teenage son Sondre, Fridjov Saheim as pragmatic boss Arvid Ovrebo, and Arthur Berning as the eager Jacob Vikra. The CGI effects are quite impressive and terrifying. While this film is a bit lacking in grand scale spectacle, it more than compensates for this with a winning wealth of heart and humanity."
" Your average disaster movie
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,5,"This film had pretty good dialogue and cinematography, but it wasn't anything special. Interesting, but probably wouldn't watch again."
" Okay. It's Sentimental & Heart Warming, But So What? Still Worth It.
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,8,"Without a doubt, ""The Wave"" was as predictable as they come. In fact, I dare say you'd hardly find any originality here, but that's not what the movie was after. Taken on its own merits as a ""what if"" disaster flick made outside of the Hollywood system (and budget), the Norwegians did a pretty good job with their little disaster attempt. Sure, it was no ""Poseidon Adventure"", ""Deepwater Horizon"", ""Titanic"" or ""Day After Tomorrow"", but for whatever love they placed in it, it showed. BTW, the cinematography alone was worth the price of admission. Who knew fjords were that strikingly beautiful and breathtaking from the sky?"
" Pretty good until the wave hits
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,6,"It starts out nicely and calmly as the tension builds toward the inevitable. The wave hits. From there, nothing is believable."
" A very simple idea, but done to perfection
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,10,"I came across this movie on a top 10 YT video about disaster movies and decided to give it a chance based on nothing more than a hunch. And i'm more than glad i did.
Usually i don't bother with small budget disaster movies, because they often blow their budget on one big CGI scene and the rest is mediocre at best. How happy i am it is not the case here. This one goes to show that you don't need a budget in the hundreds of millions to make a masterpiece, yes i said it - a masterpiece.
A very simple idea, but done to perfection. The slow build up, the deceiving tranquility of the surroundings, the cast. Everything is top-notch. Also adding few little extras i always wanted to experience in a movie of that genre like the lengths a mother would go to for her son, which in a HW blockbuster are kinda no-no.
The cast have to say was outstanding. I'm really impressed with their act and even more so keeping in mind they are not huge A-list HW movie stars, but definitely have the A-level game. The whole movie is incredibly immersive. Can't remember the last time a movie stood me up from my comfy bed and made me sit in anticipation and excitement in front of the TV; for sure it's been more than 5-6 years. The last one i can recall was a mini-series called The Triangle.
And the CGI actually is one of the most realistic ones i've seen concerning water. Really impressed with it too. For me this movie comfortably sits amongst ones like Twister and Deep Impact. It lacks the sheer scale and massiveness of 2012, Armageddon or Independence Day, but it compensates with more than enough character development and story unfolding."
" good disaster movie
",2020-02-19 00:00:00,8,"Good acting, good story, good cinematography. This is as good a disaster movie as the big-name productions out of Hollywood. Judging from the box office, however, this film did get a lot of exposure for one whose native language audience is small."
" Even though they can't speak Inglish ... it's jolly good
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,7,Who would have thunk there were tsunamis in the fjords? Who would have thunk you could make a movie about it? Who would have thunk the movie would be this good?
" GEOG 4120
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,7,"The Wave is a Norwegian disaster film about a tsunami that hits the coast of Norway after a landslide is caused by compacted rocks on the side of a mountain that crumble and fall into a large body of water. The main character, Kirstain, works as a geologist and realizes too late the disaster that is about to ensue near his home. As the tsunami is about to begin, Kristain attempts to warn his coworkers and neighbors while also rescuing his family. Unfortunately, due to the oldest son's skateboarding habit, he and his mother are unable to make it onto the hotel bus that is driving them to safety so they are forced to seek refuge in the bomb shelter of the hotel that their mother works at. While that is happening, Kristain and his youngest daughter, Julia, are able to escape up the mountain above where the water is supposed to hit. After the storm has hit and Kristain has ensured Julia's safety, he returns to the hotel to find his wife and son who he presumes are dead. Fortunately, the movie does have a somewhat happy ending when all four members of the family are reunited at the top of the mountain far away from the destruction of their town.
At least out of the disaster movies I've seen, this is the most realistic as far as the cause of the disaster and the amount/type of destruction caused by the storm. At the end of the film, they reveal that the rockslide that caused the tsunami to happen is a possibility that the coasts of Norway is awaiting due to the compacted rocks in the side of a few of their mountains. Of course for entertainment value they had to keep a few characters that were in situations that I would assume aren't surviveable in real life, but there weren't any circumstances that I thought were too unbelievable."
" Average disaster movie
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,5,"The plot was good, based upon what I believe is still a possible scenario on the west coast of Norway. Opening scenes are beautiful, showing how lovely Norway is the build up was great. After the event was disappointing, bearing in mind a tsunami of million tonnes of water has washed through the town, there were fires everywhere, how did they start.? An OK film, few irritations at how they get people to react, such as ""here take my daughter I will save your wife for you""... Yeah right. Worth a watch though."
" Quite ok
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,7,Started a bit slowly and with some minor plot holes and absolutely stupid decisions by characters but still a decent film with several very good moments
" I'm convinced...
",2019-11-19 00:00:00,2,"I'm convinced that most all European films get an automatic 7 out of 10 from film critics, even when its straight garbage. This was arguably the worst disaster film I've ever seen. It started out fine and I won't even dock points for the poor dub voicing. The story however was predictable, annoying and it's incredibly implausible that the small team of ""professionals"" monitoring the mountain could be that inept and oblivious to historical data concerning that mountain. The writers took the task of dumbing down others for the sake of the main character/hero/I-told-u-so-guy to dizzying heights. The vistas and the Wave itself might be the only things I found impressive about the entire film. NOT recommended."
" Full disclosure..
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,5,"I'm slightly intoxicated. Also I only watched about 10 minutes of this movie. I only showed up to this incidentally through my Amazone Prime subscription and just skipped to the wave waving up the place. I saw the poster a while back and thought: Woah! ..That looks generic. Immediately made me think of the Rock for some reason. So I forward to the part where it goes up. The character appear to be pretty solid in the scenes and there are a lot of nuances to pick up on from some or maybe just one performance by Kristoffer Joner who plays Kristian. He's really good in those few moments I saw. A few other charters were about as paper thin as I expected them to be. What kind of ruined it for me was how dumb everyone was in these moments. Sure there wasn't a lot of time, but some of them were just hanging about watching the wave and it was just so irritating. All I thought was: Move! What are you doing? Yea sure that's a lot of water but you're gonna die!
I was actively rooting for the water to kill everyone in these scenes.
Not sure it's supposed to work this way."
" Tense and absorbing
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,7,"Good script and acting makes this disaster movie relateable. I immediately jumped on Google to check out the facts which made it all the more scary.A pity about some of the silly plot holes like nobody knowing that other disasters were presaged by contractions. But nevertheless, a good disaster movie away from the standard Hollywood fodder."
" A big wave from me
",2019-07-31 00:00:00,10,"I didn't mind that I had to watch this with subtitles. I actually forgot this was in a foreign language. Well made and gripping. Don't be put off by the fact it's not English. If you can get by this hurdle, watch The Quake next."
" That's how to do a disaster film
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,8,"After a steady build up, the film delivers a gripping disaster scene, followed by a standard rescue at the end. How disaster films should be done."
" This wave crashed and burned.
",2019-07-08 00:00:00,5,"Solid plot, solid acting, lacking elsewhere. Pretty typical beginning to a disaster movie, our main character aware of impending doom, everyone else doesn't want to jump to conclusions so they wait too long to sound the alarm. Then ""the wave"" strikes and that's where it starts to go wrong. The actual natural disaster takes up mere moments of the movie, the main character goes tumbling around in a car and manages to wake up on dry land upside down in the car with only a cut to the forehead, and in the aftermath of the wave there are dozens of your typical rubble fires, but didn't everything just get doused with water?!
I felt a little let down by the actual disaster... everything else was okay."
" Wow, outstanding Norwegian film!
",2019-06-29 00:00:00,8,"I'm not a fan of subtitled international films, but this film was an exception. For a Norwegian production, it was grand and very impressive. The acting was outstanding, as were the S/VFX and beautiful Norwegian setting. The 105 min run-time and pacing were perfect. The acting was great. The score was on point. Writing and directing excellent. The natural disaster thrills and suspense were perfect and very realistic. A must-watch film for sure. A well deserved 8/10 from me."
" Dumbest of the dumb
",2019-06-22 00:00:00,2,"The may have been the worse movie I have ever seen. Other than the gorgeous scenery, it actually got worse as it progressed. By the end of the movie I actually had my hands over my eyes. I was transfixed waiting to see if it got any worse and it did. I kept thinking, surely not, as each scene got more ridiculous than the last. The movie has been called predictable. That's the best you could say. If you want to waste your time, watch.
But you've seen it many times before and better. You've been warned."
" Special effects
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,5,Good special effects otherwise fairly mundane story about tsunamis in Norway.
" The Same Exact Movie as The Quake
",2019-05-22 00:00:00,5,"The same actors, the same characters, and only a very slightly different disaster. I suggest watching only one or the other. Watching both is completely redundant. As in The Quake, it was the same people who caused the horrible catastrophe: teenage punks high on weed."
" A lot more dramatic than I expected
",2019-05-06 00:00:00,6,"The movie included a town that sits right on a fjord. The scientists were preparing for a rockslide that came a lot sooner than expected. The rockslide went into the fjord and created a tsunami that quickly attacked the town. They had no warning because of how fast the rockslide came and I think if they had checked the meters of the rocks sooner then they could have been more prepared for the slide.
The movie portrayed the landforms very well and the way the humans reacted to the tsunami was smart but in some ways not helpful to them. One character sat in the car, buckled up and let the tsunami hit and he survived the impact. The rest of the characters went to the basement of a hotel which was not smart. They should have gone up in the hotel in order to gain safety. Not all of the characters survived the tsunami but the different ways they reacted seemed to be decently helpful."
" Best disaster movie yeat
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,10,"GREATEST MOVIE ever. High budget film, with a great cast. The filming location is beautiful. The film director shows a wide range of scene shots. Editing is great and the cinematography is awesome. Sound quality and FX is great. The FX seem so real. The plot a small town experience a large wave.
The residence has 10 minutes to get to safety. This movie is gripping and exciting."
" An ordinary ""catastrophe plot"". Hurry, hurry, hurry or we will die...
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,4,"I did only see the first 70 minutes out of 100. A catastrophe movie I didn't like very much. To me it didn't have anything but the ordinary ""catastrophy plot"" without any extras so to speak. Hurry, hurry, hurry or we will die..."
" BEST FOREIGN DISASTER FILM.
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,8,This norwegian film puts mostly hollywood disaster movie to shame. Well done.
" Exceptional
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,9,"It was the most perfect movie I have ever seen according to nature !! Great plot ,great acting,great writing!! It is worth watching it"
" 100 % predictable
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,2,"I really enjoyed the first 30 minutes. Beautiful cinematography. Actors who looked real. A real town, real work situations. But then I got this little kernel of suspicion and flipped to the ending, sure enough it ended exactly the way I thought it would. After this I caught the 2 minutes of special effects that were left and then skipped the rest of the movie. Seen it a thousand times."
" The Norwegian 'Day After Tomorrow'
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,6,"A Norwegian ""Day After Tomorrow"" meets ""The Impossible"", meets ""Titanic"" with a bloke that looks like he's from ""The Walking Dead"".The spectacular Norwegian scenery drew me right in. The first half of the film is probably the best-looking film I've seen in a long time. I practically wanted to abandon the film for a trip direct to the nearest travel agent!The performances are strong and the lead characters quite likeable. I liked how it spent time developing the characters so that the audience could feel something for them - far too many 'disaster movies' neglect this. It really succeeded in building tension too.It probably has the most unique premise of any film of its type - and really illustrates that this place in 'real life' is indeed a ticking time bomb. Err, maybe I'll hold off on that travel agent visit.It's towards the end of the film that many actions become just too unbelievable and not practical. I found this drawing me out of the film at times. Though, a bit of the 'unbelievable' is expected with films of this type - it was a real throwback and tribute to 90s disaster films. Director Roar Uthaug's love for ""Twister"" and ""Armegddon"" was quite evident.Overall, it left me feeling a bit flat, despite it being a solid Norwegian film that was easy entertainment on a Saturday night. Just switch your brain off halfway through."
" Voice over
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,6,I wish I could watch the original version with subtitles. The voice over acting in English is awful.
" Freezing to death or not?
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,5,"There were a few things in the movie that I had so hard to take in, that it became about the negatives rather than the positives. Because the positives are there. I enjoyed most actors... in the beginning.
The story is beautifully told, the environment brilliant.
The story line draws me in slowly. I do think that I am starting to see the individuals.But then when it's finally time for the big climax, the wave is coming... it just get so damn dull and american (!!)
The geologists did eventually think of turning the alarm on. Nicely done! The alarms sound in the town. As expected, it takes a little while before people wake up or realize what is going on. But my bother here are the ten minutes. Do they count from the first sound of the alarm, or as in here, a few minutes after the alarm? He sets his watch after hearing it a few minutes actually.
The hero who rather help a stranger than taking his daughter to the top. He could not have known that she'd make it, so wouldn't the natural thing be to take care of her, in her maybe last moments, just as he do with the rest of his family? She is his daughter after all.
I feel cheated by the end.
Mainly because. How cold was the water? How long do you expect to stay alive in the cold water? How much air was there for them to breath? How come the wave didn't destroy the building before they even got into the safe room? How come a couple of people could outrun a monster like that wave? When she goes for the electricity, did she think about the bad equation of water/electricity? When the dad comes to help the mom and son, he asks them if they're in any pain. Would they even be able to feel their bodies by then? How come he so easily found them breathing in that hole? It's not as if he had a lot of breath left in him, after forcing the big blocks of stone away, opening the dark cold room...
What about the famous ""second wave""? Maybe there was a real explanation to this but we aren't getting one. We do know that as soon as the wave hit, it also receded completely, as our hero shows when he comes back into town, what seem to be directly after the hit.There are too many upsets for me to like the movie as much as I wanted to. I love Norwegian, and I could listen to that all day long, but it really wasn't much of a ""listening"" film was it. (which it never promised to be, that was just my tiny little wishful thinking)
In the end, sadly, I was hoping for the hero to die. Just to make it a tiny bit.... so sorry to wish the life out of a character, but to make it more believable and somewhat good."
" Suspenseful awesome movie
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,8,"This movie competes against Hollywood´s best disaster movies and this one surely has great acting just like 70s disaster movies. Here you don´t find the typical hero to save the day, just ordinary people.
After this movie, comes 2018´s Skjelvet (The Quake) which is kind of a sequel with the same four main actors. Both movies are awesome and the acting is amazing."
" Very good!
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,9,Extremely exciting movie with a realistic story to it. One of the better movies I've seen in a while.
" Keep it real catastrophh movie
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,6,"Following a Norwegian family in a small community gives you a dramatic but real feel on a flood catastrophy that doesnt span world wide horror or ridiculous capital city drama. Only real grievance I have is the widespread presence of fires amongst cars, buildings and inside homea after the wave strikes. Nicely filmed, pleasant audio and cozy atmosphere whilst building up for the climax."
" Watch with Subtitles only!
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,8,Having seen both versions - there's no comparison - loses all its emotional draw with English overdubbing
" What a Gem !
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,8,"I'll start off with the bad, that way I can get it out of the way and move on to the good. I'm not sure why movie companies think they need to dub anything that's not in English, it certainly doesn't do any movie any favors when your more caught up in the terrible dubbing, than you are with the movie itself ! If they must, options would be a wonderful thing, let the viewers choose between badly dubbed sound and subtitles, of which I'd much prefer the later.So it's entirely a testament to the absolutely stunning scenery and cinematography, along with the acting and directing, that I continued to keep watching this, and I'm SO glad I did !This puts to shame 99.9% of American Big budget blockbusters, the way this was filmed, using the scenery to crank up the tension is just brilliant, right from the opening scenes you were pulled into it, especially knowing what was going to happen, you couldn't help giving that beautiful scenery a sneaky glance now & then to make sure it wasn't doing anything it shouldn't !The typical lull into a false sense of security that any disaster movie has in the beginning is used to the fullest extent that it could be, you could literally feel the tension ratcheting up a notch with every moment that passed, and I doubt there would be many people that weren't screaming ""PUSH the button !!!""The scenes leading up to when the wave hits, during, and just after are pure disaster movie brilliance, so SO well done, to say I was on the edge of my chair would be understating it.Of course the movie doesn't end there, and there are the expected scenes of a final emergency along with a reunion, that's all I can really say without giving anything away, but I will add I love a Moma Bear who fights for her cub, so to speak.Even if you hate dubbed or foreign movies, but love disaster movies, give this a go, you'll find that by the time your a little way into the movie your just enjoying it. I'd rate this an 8 out of 10, it could of been a 9 but for the dubbing."
" Nice work, but terrifying thought.
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,9,"Very unexpectedly interesting. I thought this would be one of those unrealistic storylines, but no. The fact that this has already happend back in 1934 give this movie a whole other perspective. Well done."
" Catastrophes of Nature Summon Triumphs of Humanity
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,8,"A solid disaster film, rather than a disaster flick. Compared to most Hollywood treatments, this one is understated, while at the same time delivering some truly jaw-drawing effects and drama that will stick in the mind for some time to come. While almost dogmatically formulaic, the film's down-to-earth story-telling and very tangible characters are what drive the tension and make this a more relatable and therefore more impactful journey compared to the over-the-top way we've seen this done all too often in the past. This film is real, and that reality is what drew me in and carried me along, rather than a spectacle I was asked to watch from the sidelines."
" Great movie
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,9,"It really i great movie, i highly recommend it, i could not stop watching till the end."
" 10 for Nordic standard
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,10,"I was bored and just picked a random movie on my HBO app.. And boy oh boy was I surprised with this gem! I expected a nordic movie with bad CGI, but this one is actually pretty awesome! I've seen lot's of movies like this before, and although it's predictable I sat glued to the screen. The landscapes are beautyful, the actors are all doing their jobs and gave me a nice surprise."
" Finally got a chance to watch it.
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,10,Awesome movie! Great acting and truly suspenseful.
" Hooked from start to finish
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,8,This was a spectacular film. I was not expecting to be so intrigued. I enjoyed the suspense leading up to the rockslide and after. This is a must see foreign film. I will definitely be watching it again.
" Not Bad as far as disaster movies go - but!
",2018-07-07 00:00:00,6,"We managed to get a copy of this movie only with Norwegian soundtrack and English subtitles. A typical disaster movie, story line was OK and the acting was pretty good overall making it a watchable movie. Edge of your seat it was not, somehow it just lacked the intensity required for a rally good movie of this type. Now the main negatives, the SFX, was not that good and looked a bit amateurish but the worst bit is what followed as the story moved through the resultant wreckage there were random little fires scattered through the scenes, all roughly the same size and so obviously false. Question, after everything has been thoroughly soaked for an extended period why would little fires spring up. A burning gas main or a liquid fuel fire I could have accepted but it looked like a troupe of adventure scouts had just left the scene leaving their camp fires burning, as the film progressed it became laughable. Would we watch it again, probably not as there are much better movies of this type available."
" IF ONLY THEY WERE ALL LIKE THIS...!
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,7,"The Wave represents probably one of our biggest fears of the environment, a catastrophe which we, namely people of the West, didn't even know exists. Told in a dry, sober tone w/nary a recognizable superstar or humorous quip (take that future Hollywood remake!) we are thrust in a bucolic mountainous locale where an intrepid band of scientists monitor the landscape for fear of a landslide which will cause a tsunami wave killing most or all if they're not evacuated in the 10 minute allotted escape time. Putting the storytelling squarely on the intimate, the lead hero's quest to get his family to safety normalizes the spectacle rather than being swallowed by it."
" Wow, this is a must see.
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,8,"Absolutely fantastic! So much more realistic than Hollywood disaster films, with more depth and emotion without being melodramatic! The acting, visuals and music are stunning. From beginning to end, there was never a dull moment. It literally grips you from the opening and never lets go."
" Overrated!
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,2,"I don't get why this movie got too many positive reviews. It's even rated 83% on Rotten Tomatoes. Its cliched and the characters do stupid stuff all the time. I have this conspiracy theory that the Norwegian government paid for these positive reviews just so their citizens will watch this movie for information dissemination purposes. That's fine. But as a work of art, this is just dumb."
" Highly overrated, nothing special
",2018-06-29 00:00:00,3,"I was eager to watch this movie after reading all the raving reviews. I must admit, I was less than impressed overall and start to believe that most of the positive reviews must have been from overly zealous Norwegians. The film itself is just another bland disaster movie with lots of cliches, people being super dumb in their actions (presumably, people behaving cleverly would make less of a drama). Anyhow, 3 out of 10. Nothing new under the sun and nothing particularly exciting."
" Twin geared
",2018-05-10 00:00:00,6,"I would have given a solid 8 or 9 if it just stopped when the wave, hit before that was a nice well acted little disaster flick with the most spectacular scenery.Then.....a rapid descent into unbelievable cliché BS,watch until the wave after that the frustration with stupidity is overwhelming"
" A great action movie with a bit of thrill
",2018-05-03 00:00:00,9,I'd thoroughly recommend this movie. It was a classic disaster movie but without the Americanism
" Okay foreign disaster movie
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,6,"You might never think that Scandinavian filmmakers would ever tackle the disaster film genre, but if a ninja movie managed to come out of Sweden (the 1984 movie ""The Ninja Mission"", if you are curious), then anything is possible. It was certainly an ambitious effort, and while the end results are nothing spectacular, it is an okay 105 minute diversion... if you are in the right mood. If you are looking for a fast pace and constant action, you will most likely be very disappointed. The first half of the movie moves very slowly, with no real action of any kind. Once the disaster does hit, things do pick up a little, though even then there is a significant lack of real tension and action for the most part. But the movie has its strengths. It looks pretty slick and polished for the most part, able to stand its head proudly against big budget Hollywood movies. And it chooses an interesting angle, being that it's a much more realistic take on a disaster than you usually get in Hollywood disaster movies. The characters are more realistic, their actions are more believable, and the various plot turns feel plausible. This is certainly not a disaster movie for everybody - it may quickly tire and bore those looking for popcorn entertainment. But if you are curious to see a more believable cinematic portrayal of a disaster - and you are in a patient mood - you'll probably find it a decent watch."
" An Original Story, Ending Up As A Predictable Cliché.
",2017-09-06 00:00:00,3,"Already when I saw the trailer to The Wave I thought - Oh no, they have managed to go backwards to the Norwegian stone ages of film, when it comes to language, that is. There shouldn't be anything the matter with the actors, but except from that the main roles for this film, the most actors are delivering constructed lines. To a non Norwegian audience, it's probably harder to tell, but it occasionally sounds like the actors are reading from an underdeveloped script. This of course has much to do with the writing, but it's also characteristic for and being one of many examples that it is more important for many high scale makers of film and television drama in Norway to cast famous names, actors who normally are expected to do a quality job, than to look for the actual right ones, someone who could put higher level to it. The Wave was supposed to be a real blockbuster, and the makers believe the film won't sell otherwise. Most characters in this film are occupied by actors from a small environment, handpicked for mentioned reasons. Even some minor parts, two Danish hotel guests, are occupied by much used and well known actors who not necessarily are the best available. And the male Danish also character functions as a mandatory bad guy. One exception in the cast is the teenage son of the family, played by Jonas Hoff Oftebro, who also seems to be the only one managing to find his own way of speaking and acting, somehow apart from what's been written in the script, and he and his young sister appears to be quite relaxed and normal, not over acting like most of the adults. Still, most disappointing in this matter is the main actor, Kristoffer Joner, who together with Aksel Hennie, seemingly have been doing the lead in every second Norwegian movie the last years. It's like Matt Damon and Samuel L. Jackson were in all the movies, and even they are not. When Joner can't seem to find the right balance in his acting and make his character believable through much of the film, in particular the first half, it's a double shame, even though it's getting better through out the film. Maybe he had get warmed up, and perhaps the result is much the director's fault, but it'd be better if the role had been given to someone else. Another not quite so over used actress, Ane Dahl Torp, mostly does a better job as the wife. But there clearly are aspects to the film that are functioning very well. The scenographers have done a good job and the computer animated wave is very close to realistic. The animation team has got good credits for that. Sadly that does not take away the poor qualities in the dialogue, direction and acting. Widely thinking the plot is based on a phenomenon most serious, and the mountain part falling in to the Geiranger Fjord in the film, is going to do so sooner or later. Seeing the result this disaster movie as an in many ways mistaken and cliché project, has nothing to do with disrespecting the consequences that people actually will face. If only the creators could have chosen a more original language and avoided trying to make a Hollywood copy. It's obvious that this according to Norwegian standards has been quite an expensive film, and even if it it possibly is good advertising for tourism, as if the Norwegian fjords aren't world famous enough, The Wave is merely a Norwegian style Hollywood copy of a disaster film wanting hard to be a block buster. Compared to national standards it clearly got a very big audience, but it also ran of with a large pot from The Norwegian Film Institute and other Nordic support schemes, to cover the budget, money that may have been invested in many other projects, a better way to develop national film making. But at the end of the day, it's all about selling Norway, the nature and feed the national feeling of pride. In this fashion The Wave has put another stone to an already existing mountain. The story is actually fully original, not coming from a novel, but based on a kind of realistic scenario. Too bad then, that it ended up as a predictable cliché. And folks, you better do some research on first aid in drowning situations. The one responsible for research on this in The Wave obviously hasn't, perhaps neither too much when it comes to what it is to be a professional in geology."
" Promising first half, second half full of clichées
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,5,"Norwegian cinema is definitely on the rise and is by every day more and more popular in other countries and parts of the world. These movie i have watched on Serbian national TV. To this movie i have watched few Norwegian movies and all were great so i expected something good and different from Hollywood, even if the main story of the movie is natural catastrophe. First half of the movie is very good, it has some plot, some atmosphere and the acting by main character Kristoffer Joner is superb, and when catastrophe begin, everything becomes full of American clichés, especially the ending. It was painful to watch really. I really don't understand why every corner of the globe wants to be similar to Americans, i really didn't expect that especially from Norwegians. I hope that their movies will not be Americanized fully in the process.The Wave gets 5/10 from me."
" A good surprise
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,7,"It's a good movie, above the average acting, incredible photography and not so bad special effects. The tension the movie builds really gets you, it's easy to start to care about the characters. It's worth the watch, for me a great surprise, but basically, it's The Impossible on Fjords."
" Now this was an impressive Norwegian movie...
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,6,"Granted that I hadn't actually heard about ""Bølgen"" (aka ""The Wave"") prior to finding it by sheer random luck. I was initially intrigued by the movie's cover and since I do like disaster movies, naturally I picked up the movie. And I must say that the fact that this was a Norwegian made movie only further fueled my interest. So I needed little convincing to sit down to watch it.Writers John Kåre Raake and Harald Rosenløw-Eeg sure know how to build up a story. I was more than impressed with the way that the story was constructed and put together. And director Roar Uthaug did a really good job at bringing the story to life on the screen.The movie starts out with some solid character defining introductions, while it slowly starts to add layers to the movie, introducing the storyline and plot in a very interesting way. And the build up of the movie did result in a very satisfying climax to say the least, because when the landslide happens and the massive wave is triggered it just becomes that much more intense.Speaking of the wave, then I will say that the special effects team really pulled this off quite nicely in a very convincing and realistic way. The CGI effects were very impressive and served the movie quite nicely.Personally I do, however, think that some of the air started to deflate once the wave had struck and the people were dealing with the immediate aftermath of the destruction and the disaster. Then the movie turned rather generic and predictable. Which was a real shame, because the movie had been really impressive up to that point. It was as if the movie lost momentum once the wave had ebbed out, sort of lost most of its impact - pardon the pun.""Bølgen"" had some really talented acting performers on the cast list. Kristoffer Joner really carried the movie quite well with his performance, and this guy is definitely an actor with some impressive talent, and since this was the first time I had seen him, I must say that I am intrigued to watch more that he stars in. It was also nice to see a couple of Danish performers to show up in this Norwegian movie, and they had managed to get Thomas Bo Larsen, whom is actually a largely known name in Denmark.If you enjoy disaster movies, and if you have no problem with non-English movies, then you should definitely take the time to sit down and watch ""Bølgen"", because it is a very entertaining and enjoyable movie."
" If you love disaster movies, you'll totally dig this.
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,7,"This film is a great achievement, the effects and acting are stellar. Despite being a Scandinavian film, it is on par with a Hollywood disaster movie. However that is also the problem.There was an opportunity here to let you get comfortable with the patterns of Hollywood disaster movies, then take advantage of not being bound by those rules by completely subverting the viewer's expectations in the final moments. Sadly, this opportunity is missed."
" b movie
",2017-05-22 00:00:00,8,"A Norwegian geologist (Kristoffer Joner) and his family (Ane Dahl Torp, Jonas Hoff Oftebro) fight for survival when a massive landslide causes a 250-foot tidal wave.The story is somehow similar to (The Impossible 2012), but the screenplay was perfect due to its realistic. The drama is more than the thriller in the film. The shooting was amazing showing all stunning places in the valley and city in mountains. Good acting was presented by Kristoffer Joner."
" A thrilling disaster that eclipses the Hollywood wannabes
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,8,"I loved the disaster movies of the 70's, 80's, from The Towering Inferno, Earthquake, Poseidon Adventure, Cassandra Crossing to the 90's Dantes Peak, Twister, Deep Impact and Volcano. The Day after Tomorrow while okay began the downward spiral as effects took over from story telling and every plot line focused on a family divided while everyone else died around them. That became tiresome but more so because there was no connection with these families, they were secondary to effects. Plus situations that were impossible to survive suddenly were less so and you lost the audience to lots of eye rolling and sighing. 2012 and San Andreas been the two main culprits. The Wave strips everything back, yes we have a family at the center of the drama but enough time is given to them that we care what happens. The build up to the main disaster event is slow and ominous. When it happens you are on edge watching the horror envelope the characters. I have two gripes with the film, the first is more time should have been given to some of the secondary characters so that when they were killed the impact would have been felt more, (Star Trek red coat syndrome at work). Where the film begins to unravel a little is in the aftermath, ten minutes are given to a main character going back to the scene of devastation yet doesn't come across any other survivors or wounded. Had they just fleshed it out a little more it would have gotten 10 stars, the acting is top notch, the scenario is terrifying and the scenery is breathtaking. More character driven disaster movies like this are needed."
" Don't waste your time
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,2,"Acting was awful. Plot clichéd. Dubbing into English not too annoying but they didn't subtitle the cell phone texts or some of the other written things that I guess moved the plot. Not the absolute worst movie I've ever seen but Sharknado 1 2 and/or 3 were more entertaining. On the positive side, the scenery is astoundingly beautiful....except for the big wave, you might want to go vacation there."
" Small Nuances that stood out from Clichés
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"An amazingly well done movie for a not so big budget. You will find yourself questioning ethics, family vs humanity, and fear vs hope.There are some small nuances to cliché scenes that make a difference in the overall experience. These nuances are why I love foreign movies. What I mean is that some events are left open just like in life not everything gets to a resolution."
" The first half is much better than the second ....
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,6,"The science leading up to the mountain landslide and resulting tsunami, is far more interesting than the questionable survival techniques that follow. The beginning has breathtaking scenery and is almost all in daylight. Once the impressive c.g.i. tsunami is over, things shift into closeup images in almost total darkness, and the believability scale descends dramatically. I would say that the chances of an ending like we witness is many millions to one. Nowhere is the hypothermia factor even mentioned. Being submerged in what must be frigid fjord water for even a few minutes would most likely be fatal. ""The Wave"" is not a bad movie, it is just a film that stretches things a bit far. If you can look beyond that, then it is a movie worth watching. - MERK"
