" Starts out reasonably funny, then becomes a farce gimmick
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,5,"There are some really funny scenes to be enjoyed and I had faith in it at the start, but this movie is a farce gimmick that lasts too long.There is a fine line for me between good farce and tedious farce and although it could have been great with a better direction and acting, it wasnt to be...The good: Jordan Peele co-WROTE this movie. His master's hand can be noticed in several scenes. But dont get your hopes up...The bad: the actors are mediocre. They just arent really funny. Neither are the jokes, which are the same throughout the movie, repeated over and over. There isnt any surprise in the story either, nor in anything else.It's a teenager popcorn movie, not really suited for anyone else."
" I liked it. Different can be funny.
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,6,"I'm not sure what people are after when looking for comedy. People have different views on what makes a belly laugh or just a smirk. For me this was just what I needed at the time, yes it's silly and yes it's not a serious action movie but it did make me laugh, so it's a 6 from me."
" Good comedy
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,8,"Over the top, unrealistic plot with outlandish characters.Movies funny. can't say more than that. i enjoy it.It's not Citizen Kane but it's decent, worth watching"
" Wish it was Better
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,6,"Keanu is Key and Peele's film debut and is about two best friends who hatch a plan to pose as drug dealers for a street gang, in order to get their stolen kitten back. I had high expectations for this film, Key and Peele have dominated the sketch comedy scene for a few years now, putting out some of the funniest sketches. Most of their sketches are within five minutes, so with their film debut I was a little hesitant that the movie may just feel like a drawn out sketch that would get old fast. And though at times the film did feel like that, it overall is just an average comedy with a bit of good joke writing thrown in. First off, in a year that was dominated by weak comedies, I never felt like Keanu lived up to the potential it had. Most of the jokes either fell flat or were recycled. The funniest scenes in the film took place in a minivan where Clarence (Keegan-Michael Key's character) was showing off his music library and introducing common thugs to artists such as WHAM!. However this scene is intertwined with another subplot of Jordan Peele delivering drugs and sadly this portion of the film is greatly drawn out and not really that funny. I would have loved to have seen the gang travel across the city delivering drugs, rather than just going to one house. Im not asking for revolutionary plot points, but the one thing a comedy is meant to do, is make me laugh and I didn't feel that Keanu made me laugh all that much. The charisma and chemistry between Key and Peele is there, as one would expect, however much of the movie relied on safe jokes, that didn't really contribute much. The movie did get progressively funnier over time but by the end it felt too late. This is a light hearted tale, that does go by pretty fast, it's the perfect film to put on at parties and does get a lot of re-watchability. I can also appreciate the writers wanting to tell a unique and different story and for that Keanu gets 6.5/10. I did have fun with this film, despite its lack of funniness that I expected from Key and Peele, I do hope that they give the film process another shot."
" Funny AF
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,7,I LOVE the comedy duo Jordan Peele and Keegan Michael Key. I love their TV show cause that show is so damn hilarious. So when I came in to Keanu I was ready to watch some funny and comedy moments. It had moments that made me laugh my ass off. It was hilarious to see Key and Peele doing their comedy on the big screen. However I do agree that there were some elements in the film that just did NOT land for me sometimes it felt generic at best and I was kind of shame because I wanted to LOVE this film NOT like it. Oh and the cat...... I saw this with my girlfriend and she fell in LOVE with the cat so much and she was dying to see that cat again when we were watching the film at home. I mean my girl is a cat lover and when she saw the cat she just wanted to grab it and hug the hell out of it. And I agree that is a cute cat. Sadly I wish we got more into the cat. 7/10
" It was aight
",2020-07-16 00:00:00,6,"Fun crime comedy movie, but if you've seen the trailer you probably know the type of movie it is. 2 normal guys end up faking being gangsters, shenanigans ensue. It's been a while since I've seen a movie like this, one of those classic alright action or comedy movies. That's what it was for me. Alright.The acting is alright, but then again they literally just have to act as stereotypical gangster black people. Say the N-word a bunch and act like they've killed a lot of people. The cinematography, camera work and music was also good enough. However a couple times the music did not blend into each other well at all.That's about it? I don't have a lot to say about this one. It was alright, I do wish they focused more on Keanu though, since that seems to be why people came to see the movie in all honesty."
" Uneven and stretched 'ying and yang' adult comedy
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,6,"A couple of inoffensive cousins (Rell Williams, Keegan-Michael Key) get mixed up in a murderous gangsta turf war and a related violent 'custody' battle over a kitten (Keanu, voiced (briefly) by Keanu Reeves). The core premise is amusing (no matter how vicious and malignant they are, all of the criminals love the kitten) but is too slender to stretch into a full-length movie. Most of the scenes go on too long and after a while everything starts to look and sound the same. The plot, which essentially buttresses a single joke, doesn't make a lot of sense and the final 'twist' is a bit of a stretch even for a farce. Considering the heightened racial sensitivities these days (early 2020), it is interesting to see a film where the 'n-word' features so prominently as a comic tool (supporting 'context is everything' arguments I guess). The cast is quite good, especially Williams and Key, and as a counter-point farce superimposing ultra-cute on ultra-violence, the film is moderately successful, but in the end, I only found it fitfully amusing (but other than liking cats, I doubt that I'm in the target audience)."
" Perfection
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,10,"Perfectly put, reminds you of old time comedies in the 90s and reminds you key and peele with their wonderful performance
I rate it as must watch comedy."
" They're not kitten around!
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,8,"We've all seen what Keanu will do if you mess with his dog, but how do Jordan Peele and Keegan Michael Key react if you mess with their kitten...named Keanu. These gentle hearted best buds will have to take on an entire criminal underworld if they ever hope to see little Keanu again. Hilarity ensues. Some occasional splattery action, nudity, and pervasive language will keep mainstream audiences away, but I'm sure that this movie has a long life ahead of it as a cult classic. The movie has a very silly sense of humor but never loses sight of what makes our two protagonists unique and endearing. They're in over their head chasing a cat but we get the sense that this quest is much more meaningful than what we see on the surface. Jordan Peele's character can't walk away from the situation, he's not just chasing his lost kitten. He's chasing the very notion that his broken emotional state can ever be whole again. His personal life was shattered and Keanu the kitten represented hope that he could be whole again one day, he can't just walk away from that. Keegan Michael Key's character is a father who feels generally weak and ineffective. He can't leave his best friend to certain self-destructive doom. Additionally, he's driven by the need to prove to himself that he's tough enough to stand up for those he cares about. This isn't just a movie about chasing a kitten, it's a hilarious fish-out-of-water journey of self-actualization for our protagonists and that's what makes Keanu great.-Josh Evans"
" Give it a break
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,9,"Yes this is almost like a comedy sketch .. stretched to a feature length movie. Having said that, it is funny. I mean really funny! And mean and maybe a little bit obnoxious! But all with a good heart ... I mean how can you hate a movie that makes gangsters sing George Michael? You can't ... you just can't, it's impossible to do so.Having said that, the comedians at work here, really give it their best, sometimes more than once (like our main actors having a dual role). I guess naming the cat Keanu was a nod to not just Keanu Reeves (name checked in a weird sequence in the movie) but also John Wick .. some might even say this is the Anti John Wick. Like cats and dogs ..."
" One of my favourite comedy
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,9,"Keanu is a funny and humorous movie that left me feeling very entertained. The humor in this movie was perfect for my liking. If you love the 'Key and Peele' sketches, you will find this movie entertaining. I thought both Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key delivered an amazing comedic performance that left me laughing out loud. Keanu has a simple story that is brilliantly executed. The pacing of the movie was perfect. Overall, its a movie that really clicked with me and I see myself rewatching this movie in the near future."
" Would've made a hilarious five-minute fake trailer on the small screen, which may shine a light on the type of growing pains to expect if they continue this transition to film
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,4,"Key and Peele, in their first starring vehicle, play a pair of soft suburban dudes who somehow find themselves acting like thuggish, grizzled killers to retrieve a stolen kitten (the titular Keanu). It's a terrible screenplay, but at least the laughs are there for the first act. After that, it falls into endless re-hashes, basically telling the same two or three jokes against a different backdrop for the length of the picture. I loved these guys on TV, but Keanu doesn't do a great job of highlighting their versatility and eventually goes beyond satire to become exactly the type of movie they're lampooning. Would've made a hilarious five-minute fake trailer on the small screen, which may shine a light on the type of growing pains to expect if they continue this transition to feature-length material."
" Over hypted
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,5,Had some funny moments but just not that interesting. Lots of stars.
" Gotta love a cute kitten
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,8,"Code switching and a kitten worth infiltrating a gang for, what's not to love?"
" love it
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,9,Get Out is good. Us is crap. Keanu is awesomeness! great fun all round!
" dumb but very funny
",2019-09-16 00:00:00,8,"In this buddy comedy about two suburban guys trying to fake their way through the criminal underground, Key and Peele prove themselves just as funny (although considerable less edgy) as in their TV series.The premise is utterly ridiculous: a really cute kitten disappears and the friends have to join a drug ring to get it back. Once you get past that it basically makes sense except for one incredibly unpersuasive face-off near the end.Key & Peele are two funny guys with great chemistry. Anna Faris has a hilarious cameo as a bats**t crazy version of herself, and the script is consistently funny. If you want something fun that requires no brainpower whatsoever, this is a great choice."
" Excellent
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,9,"I like to watch comedy at nights and this is exactly the movie I was looking for. While most of the other people are sleeping, I am just laughing like a little devil in the dark. And I also like how did Jordan Peele set up a double plot twist for most movies he writes, always made me watch it over and over again. And each time was completely new for me."
" It's about a cat.
",2019-07-06 00:00:00,10,"Named Keanu, so forgive me for rating it so high, but I love cats generally speaking AND it has Keanu in it, so that in itself makes it awesome haha. But I understand why it got the rating it did, but I found it funny."
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,6,Good fun movie with some funny parts. Not as funny as I would hoping to be based on how much I laughed at the Key and Peele show. But it still took me to new places and different experiences. (1 viewing)
" The kitten was cute
",2019-06-29 00:00:00,6,"Key and Peele have a huge fanbase, but for me the big appeal of Keanu is the little kitten. And Keanu the kitten was a cute little thing and his bits were the best bits for me. Otherwise the film was a fairly average offering. Key and Peele clearly have chemistry considering their working history but most of the jokes were lightweight and the story was pretty standard. The best part was Keanu Reeves' cameo. Sadly underwhelming."
" Literally cracked me up
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,10,What's wrong with people ...this is so funny. I haven't laughed that much in ages. Some absolute classics in this... 17th street crips!!! I've watched it a few times and it never fails to make me laugh. So different and all for the love of a kitten.
" GIMME THAT CAT CALENDAR
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,6,"A good balance of action and comedy. Full of Key and Peele comedy throughout causing atleast a giggle from the jokes. I was a dog lover before, now I'm very much a cat person aswell. It had a very consistent story but it does miss the mark for me in places, hence not giving it a perfect score. Overall, if you don't take the film too seriously, then you'll have a good time, with the comedy duo geniuses that are Key and Peele."
" Keanu
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,10,Love love love this movie! Hilarious and witty. Key and Peele are the best comedy team today!
" I get it but just didn't need it.
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,4,"I definitely understand the humor that they were going for with this movie, and I'm sure for a lot of people it really hit home, but for me, I just couldn't get into it. It didn't have the laughs that I was hoping for. It had moments where it actually got funny, but it often times would rely too heavily on the over-the-top bit of comedy that normally drives me away.I do think that Key and Peele are great actors and have wonderful comedic timing, but this one was a miss for me."
" worst scenario ever!!
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,3,Jordan should only make horror movies. I was fooled by that kitty and I lost time in my life that I can not recover. one of the most annoying movies in my life
" A paper-thin plot and repetitive gags
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,4,"Watching Keanu is like hearing someone tell a really long joke - while there are some funny parts, the punchline makes you wonder if the whole thing was worth it. There is some solid humor in this movie, but it's watered down by a paper-thin plot and repetitive gags. I'm disappointed. I had high hopes for this movie. The cat is cute, though."
" Hilarious
",2018-12-08 00:00:00,10,If you like cats and humor this movie is great. Way funnier than I ever thought it would be
" Yo, where's the cat ?
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,6,"This comedy starring a duo which adapted some caracters they portrayed in a TV show, shows promising, but becomes a bit long. We would have liked to see more of the cat.However, the misadventures of those ""misfits"" into gangland has its moments, with the references of the late George Michael and Keanu Reeves. And somewhat the cat saves the day at one point...It remains violent at times when too much of gunplay is seen. And crude language as well. Watch it just if you would like an idea how it is to meddle with gangland wars...And yeah, the cat makes it well..."
" 6/10 up from 5/10 first watch
",2018-04-14 00:00:00,5,"Came to film expecting similar content to Key & Peele standup. Jokes were much thinner on the ground. Plot a bit crazy to take too seriously. Romantic interest being a police officer made no sense (-1) but them going to jail anyway was a nice twist (+1).Rewatch from when I first watched it in Denver, Colorado."
" Key & Peel Have Got Cattitude!
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,10,"Thanks to the groundbreaking work of modern tv legends, Key and Peele, cat's finally have an action hero to look up to. I saw John Wick and thought it all fell apart in the first act - who would start a gang war because of a lousy dog?! But a cat in the titular role? Now you have my attention!"
" Some really funny parts, a tad uneven
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,7,"The premise is a little stretched in parts, but there's some really great comedy bits in here. Devolves into an action movie at the end, but they kind of had themselves backed into a corner. They didn't take themselves too seriously overall, so you can overlook the fact that Key suddenly became a great shot and had no problem killing after a movie of being chicken. This was a decent comedy and worth watching."
" Not Their Best Work
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,6,"I have to admit that this movie was a bit of a disappointment after seeing a number of the Key and Peele YouTube skits, most of which are pretty good (i.e. Substitute Teacher). Although the movie has a solid premise, none of it felt believable. Due to this I found myself caring very little about the characters, good or bad. Subsequently, the use of dumb humor makes the characters seem unintelligent, which leads to a loss of interest with the story-line. There were a few funny moments but nothing that stood out as hilarious. Seemed like they were trying too hard to be funny by acting ridiculous, rather than by writing quality jokes."
" It was a mediocre comedy ...
",2018-03-07 00:00:00,6,"... that held enough entertainment for me that I can say I enjoyed the movie. I find some of Key and Peeles skits to be a little dull or too long and that is what this movie felt like for me a longer skit that was a little too stretched out to make it funny all the way through. This movie is right on the border of being too blah to watch. I found for a comedy it was a little too serious (whether through the acting or the script I don't know), the silly parts weren't quiet outrageous or silly enough - like the fact that all these hardened criminals would do anything for this kitten, which is shown over and over again. The action scenes (if it were an action movie which it isn't) weren't anything special, lots of people getting shot. It's a movie that makes you smirk, chuckle and go that is humorous vs a movie like say Dumb and Dumber that makes you laugh out loud while slapping your knee.Overall an ok movie worth watching once but don't go in with high hopes."
" Uninteresting acting completely..
",2018-02-14 00:00:00,2,"Concept was good, but better acting could have been successful with the movie.. 
Scenes as well were not funny.. 
Not really a comedy, but much boring."
" A great and interesting comedy
",2018-02-13 00:00:00,10,"All I can say about this movie is that it's great comedy and I really enjoyed it!
This movie was fascinating and I had a burst of laughs during the whole movie which made my day much better.
I really recommend this movie."
" Disgusted.
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,3,"This movie was terrible. I didn't even sit through the first hour of it. The plot is way too far fetched, the dialogue being cheesy is an understatement, and the ideas are just wild in a bad way. The only reason I gave it any stars was that it was kind of funny but that's all the good things I have to say about it."
" A little too unoriginal, but Key and Peele make it work
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,7,"So there's not much plot originality here once you get past the kitten (""And then these suburban black guys have to speak ebonics with drug dealers! It's like a fish out of water action comedy!""). But the dialogue and performances are what you would expect from these guys: pitch perfect. The comic moments are natural, character driven and - yes - hilarious. Plenty of film references, plenty of laughs. So when it veers into silly or familiar territory, you're willing to go along for the ride. Basically, it had all the low moments and high moments of a K&P episode, which - on the whole - was a good thing."
" Don't kill me. I know everything about hip-hop.
",2017-12-04 00:00:00,8,"After a shoot out, a kitten shows up at the door of Rell (Jordan Peele) who was just dumped by his girl friend. His cousin Clarence (Keegan-Michael Key ) shows up to comfort him. When drug dealers accidentally rob Rell's house, they take Keanu, the kitten. Rell and Clarence who ""talk like white guys"" pretend to be tough gangsters, putting on a persona. Clarence, now called ""Shark Tank"" is a corporate team builder who uses that ability and his love for George Michael's music to help bring the gang together as they go on a job to prove themselves in order to get back the cat. They are now selling a drug which is like "" (smoking) the crack of God."" With kittens being more popular than pop stars on U-Tube it was just a matter of time before they get combined into other genres. This was a cute and clever film which made me smile a lot. Even though Jordan Peele co-wrote the film Keegan-Michael Key stole the scenes.Guide: Plenty of swearing, brief stripper nudity (?)"
" Kool Kitten
",2017-11-13 00:00:00,5,"Rell (Jordan Peele) is a slacker just dumped by his girlfriend when suddenly a cute kitten shows up which cheers him up. He calls the kitten Keanu. When Keanu goes missing he gets his cousin Clarence (Keegan-Michael Key) to get the kitten back. Clarence is a nice guy whose wife has gone for the weekendIt turns out a local drugs gang might had mistakenly taken Keanu so Rell and Clarence adopt a gangster persona to get in with them. However the two then fall foul of two hit men the Allentown Boys.This is a rather a hit and miss action comedy with an absurd premise which makes little sense. I felt it was too uneven, rather undeveloped but it gets better as it goes along. Probably when George Michael starts singing Faith in a hazy drug induced dream sequence where Keanu speaks with the voice of Keanu Reeves."
" Key & Peele Explode onto the Big Screen in KEANU
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,7,"When ""Key & Peele"" was blowing up on Comedy Central, I didn't have cable and, when I did, I didn't use it much so I only ever caught episodes when it happened to be on at a friend's house where I happened to be hanging out. I've only seen a dozen or so full episodes but I always loved what I saw. It was easily Comedy Central's best stand-up/sketch show since ""Chappelle's Show"". If you were a fan of ""Key & Peele"", chances are you'll love KEANU. It's essentially a ""Key & Peele"" sketch expanded to feature length. Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key are Rell and his cousin Clarence, respectively. As we meet them, Rell is reeling from a particularly nasty break-up and Clarence is hoping to find a means of taking his mind off of it, but Rell's mood is quickly lifted by the surprise arrival of an adorable kitten (whom he names Keanu) at his doorstep. When a wrong address leads local gang members to wreck his apartment and cat-nap Keanu, Rell recruits Clarence to join him in confronting the leader of the Blips (a gang consisting of members who weren't good enough for the Bloods or Crips) and their leader Cheddar (Method Man) for his cat. Some miscommunication later, Cheddar believes them to be the notorious Allentown Bros, an assassin duo that had effortlessly obliterated a local rival drug ring, and agrees to hand over Keanu in exchange for a little assistance in his own drug operation.The crux of the movie is how Rell and Clarence are the least tough, least street smart men to be getting involved in organized crime. It's your usual fish-of-out-water scenario where our heroes are a stoner and a married man with a passion for the music of George Michael. The plot is basic and, honestly, the biggest disappointment in the movie because you can predict everything that's going to happen. You know what story beats are coming and can generally figure out how everything will play out, though there are a few surprises in there. When Rell and Clarence accompany Cheddar's unit to deliver a package of his lethal new street drug Holy Sh*t to a local Hollywood starlet's house, it's a pretty cool moment with a fun cameo that would almost feel a little too long if it weren't constantly cutting away to Clarence in the van explaining to the gangbangers how George Michael's music deserves their respect. It's moments like that, and the fantastic chemistry of Key and Peele with their knack for playing the dorkiest suburbanites, that make KEANU so much fun in spite of the half-hearted script. If you were disappointed when ""Key & Peele"" completed its run, here is where you can get your fix until the guys find the time to put together another project together. Just keep expectations in check; I was so hyped by the positive buzz for this movie that I was a little disappointed the first time I watched it.Like I said, the writing won't win any awards but the comedy, and even the action, is on point. There's some decent action here. I guarantee Key and Peele had a load of fun making this. They even have dual roles, portraying the movie's actual Allentown Bros with all their Matrix-esque acrobatics, gunplay, and cold-blooded murdering. I had to double-check the cast listing because they're covered in some Frankenstein-level makeup effects to hide it. The comedians may be the heroes (and villains, I guess) of the movie but the real star of KEANU is Keanu. I mean, come on, the kitten's adorable. Just look at him with his little do-rag on. You can't tell me a kitten clinging to the hood of a speeding car won't put you on the edge of your seat. He even gets his own hero moment *and* he's voiced by Keanu Reeves because of course he is. I should clarify, he only speaks once and it's during a drug-induced hallucination. This isn't a movie about a talking cat. But I'd watch that too if it feature Key and Peele. So yeah, KEANU is fun. It could've used some rewrites to punch up the actual plot but it's elevated by our three stars. Fans of their show will certainly find this to be a surefire hit and people who aren't familiar with the duo's show might be inspired to seek it out. Either way, I can't wait to see what these guys might put out next."
" Too many dialogues
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,5,"Personally, i like gangsta movies. I like the style,jokes are good to me, but this one particular movie suffers from being filled with too much dialogue, and so less action. Opening scene made very good, then you realize that music made for this movie is also being a parody to action movies in a good way. Everything is a parody in this movie. Some scenes remind me of a GTA video games. Story is OK, and the kitten is indeed very cute. I would recommend watching this. And at the same point i m not. I give this a 5/10 for very long and sometime pointless dialogues."
" Key & Peele's 1st movie + cute kitten = good fun
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,7,"Clarence (Keegan-Michael Key) is a conservative suburbanite with a wife and child. His cousin, Rell (Jordan Peele), is a bong-smoking slacker. Then one day Rell finds a kitten on his doorstep and immediately takes it in. He names the kitten Keanu. A few weeks later, in a case of mistaken identity, members of the Blips drug gang break into his house, ransack it and take Keanu. Rell and Clarence set off into Blips territory to recover Keanu.Only watched this because it stars Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. Loved their comedy show, Key and Peele, and a full-length comedy feature film starring them sounded promising.The movie certainly retains much of the trademark Key and Peele humour. Add in an absurd-yet-fun plot and a cute kitten and you have a good comedy movie. Some great scenes and lines. Key and Peele are in fine form in the lead roles, with spot-on delivery and the wonderful comedic chemistry that their TV show demonstrated.Not brilliant though. As with many transitions from TV to film, the momentum and ideas seem to diminish as the movie goes on - the core plot line proves difficult to sustain for 90+ minutes. The comedy is still there, but the movie becomes more uneven the further into it you go. Some pretty weak scenes towards the end. The plot becomes quite haphazard and farcical.Overall, however, Keanu is good fun and well worth watching."
" Boring
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,3,"I love comedy and my wife tolerates that so when I can get her to watch a comedy with me, I am really hoping she will like it. Once we finished the movie the very first thing she said was ""boring"" and sadly I have to agree with her. If I had not read in the film synopsis that the main character had just suffered a breakup with his girlfriend, it would have been easy to miss. That part was very much rushed and not well developed. And that is how the rest of the movie went. It was like a series of skits strung together most of which were not very well developed and only loosely tied together. I really wanted to like this movie ... which for me made it tolerable. It was a bit humorous at times, but no real LOL moments ... simply a few chuckles once in awhile. The best part of the movie was the cat and they did do a few creative things with the cat, but other than that this is not a movie I would ever watch again or recommend to a friend."
" Key and Peele on steroids
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,7,"Keanu is the epitome of the Key and Peele skits pumped with a larger budget and movie-like steroids. Spear-headed by an experienced director; Peter Atencio, Keanu is a perfect blend of comedy and action. The film funnily revolves around a cute kitten named Keanu whilst two simple suburban men have to build cliché tropes around them to blend in. Key and Peele both show off their amazing acting talent in their different personas. There are repercussions to actions, there are first experiences, and there are strange relationships. All in the name of comedy. A strange fixation on George Michael is a running gag that helps lighten the cliché runaround. Keanu is a simply fun ride."
" Great fun! Just what I needed for those Sunday blues.
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,7,"I've just seen this on a Sunday night. I was in an undemanding mood, and in need of a laugh. What I got was a film which satisfied not just as a comedy but as a fully rounded movie about friendship. There is a heart at the centre of this strangely sweet story, and it's all thanks to the considerable talents of Jordan Peele and Keegan Michael-Key, both instantly likable as the hapless cousins in way over their head. I was surprised by the fresh twists the movie gives which marks it out from the usual fare which has been churned out lately. For starters, the decision to treat the gang members, for which our heroes join, as constructive plot devices for the film and not just background caricatures means we do ultimately care about their fate, especially as each party is able to learn something new about the other. For example, George Michael IS the real OG.There is also a certain emotional edge to the piece too - we see at one point a real personal issue affect one of our duo, and this for me made it more accessible for me to invest in the characters and also show these are people too, which the writers have put some care into.The relative low budget for Keanu is put to good measure as well, with the slow motion shoot-outs fitting in nicely alongside the quirky scenes early on of Peele getting to know the cute feline. Nothing felt too overblown or contrived to fit the context of the scene.The tight supporting cast deserve kudos too. The appearances of Anna Faris and Luiz Guzman do lend more of a B- movie star appeal, but I also loved Will Forte's role as a failure of a weed dealer, constantly being degraded in a series of daft set pieces. Oh yeah and the film star for which the title of the movie lends itself turns up to give some much needed advice to Key in a particular time of crisis.I really liked this movie, for its offbeat interplay between the immensely endearing pair, and their hilarious transition into inept streetwise crime lords. If you need cheering up this ticks all the boxes. It's not a classic by any means, but it doesn't have to be, and is all the better for not making itself out to be more than what it is."
" Has it's share of moments but this cat-centric comedy mostly falls flat
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,4,"Showcasing the gulf that often exists between making the jump from skit comedy and online fame to feature length films, American comedy superstars Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key have for their first venture into original Hollywood filmmaking (released direct to disc here in Australia) failed to make cat centred comedy Keanu a film of note.Continuing on a rather unfortunate trend of recent comedies that just aren't actually that funny and are often overly violent and mean spirited, Keanu initially begins as something likely to be adored by cult comedy fans (eg; those that like their Grandma Boy and Idiocracy) as the adorable kitten Keanu takes up home with Peele's down on his luck Rell, but once poor old Keanu finds himself kidnapped (kitnapped?) by Method Man's gangster Chedar, things within Key and Peele's adventure quickly take a downward spiral of unfunny and overlong events.Quiet funny in small doses, as their fame and many smart skits attest to, Key and Peele struggle to make the most of their undoubted chemistry as their mild mannered cousins take a step up as a pair of fake super hit-man/drug slingers and the two take a potentially funny if done correctly idea of these two everyday man impersonating people their not too far which extends to annoying put upon accents, George Michael fandom and a seriously odd scene involving Anna Farris.Key and Peele's performances here pose a large question mark over whether or not they can transition into fully fledged movie stars as it seems smaller doses rather than large doses of the two offer up more potential for them to make their particular brand of comedy tick over into feature length ventures.Flirting at times with making something of its potentially hilarious premise, Keanu showcases snippets of genuine comedic gold but it's often lost in amongst a story line that struggles to maintain momentum and ends up in rather uninteresting territory from the random possibilities it initially proposed.Likely to be loved by the fans that can't get enough of Key and Peele and for those that loves seriously cute kittens, Keanu is a disappointing culmination for Key and Peele after a number of years making their mark with much funnier skits.2 do-rag wearing kittens out of 5"
" Could have been better
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,6,"A promising film considering the talent involved however it falls short. Still worth watching for a few laughs here and there. I just feel that if Key and Peele directed this, it would have been funnier. Anyway, the movie is about two friends who go undercover into the ghetto in order to save their pet cat, hilariously named Keanu.. which means cool breeze in Hawaiian. So yeah, the concept behind the movie are right up Key and Peele's wheelhouse. But honestly this film should have been better. I would blame the director but now that I think about it, frankly the writing is lacking the comedic punch needed to make this a classic comedy, which it should have been."
" Let's Forget This one
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,4,"So glad I didn't pay to see this mess in theaters. I love key & Peele's sketch comedy and throw in the always beautiful Nia Long for good measure and you have my attention; plus, I'm a cat lover to boot. All that said, as others have noted this thinly plotted violent comedy is just a series of sketches that drag on way too long. This would have made a funny 30 minute special episode. But at 100 minutes, it's just one over-long scene after another. Yes, there are other things Key and Peele are trying to do in addition to the laughs. But a comedy is first and foremost judged on being funny, not a chore to sit through.Let's just forget this first (and hopefully not the last) feature film outing from this duo and remember them for a great TV show and fitting send off for Pres. Obama."
