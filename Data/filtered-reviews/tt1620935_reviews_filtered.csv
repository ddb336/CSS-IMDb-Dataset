" Good
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,8,"I thought this was really good. The scene where the halo was removed, though painful, was also funny."
" Great Message
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,7,"I rated this movie as a 7, but I give it 8 for the first hour and 6 for the rest of the movie. The last hour could have had a better plot and focus more on the struggles of Pazienza. It is a good story of superation, mixed with some comedy and great performances by Miles Teller and Aaron Eckhart. For me the best part of the movie is the message that it is possible to overcome great challenges and get back to the top."
" Miles teller 10 Ben younger 1
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,1,"Ben younger is a terrible director, allowing directorial slip ups that bring you right out of the movie.
Everyone's accent is bad. The makeup is horrible. Half the actors don't make sense and miles is mis cast, as he doesn't have the age to play a comeback, the kid looks 18. There's no excuse, Scorsese bankrolled it and should have made Ben burn all the copies. Except for miles, this is straight trash. I'm not trolling, watch the movie and tell me I'm wrong. Do better Ben."
" Could Have Been A Contender
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,6,"This film should have all the ingredients for a rousing boxing biography, but a couple critical ones are missing: character and conflict. It has a great cast but very little introspection. It's like reading a book without internal dialogue. Why does Vinny box? When did it start? What gives him that drive to overcome? Is he fighting for something, someone, himself, opinions, etc.? Other than a lot of pained grimaces, there's really no conflict either. There's no baddie lurking in the corners like an Apollo Creed, there's no one out to stop him, or to drag him down like a Dicky Eklund. Instead, he himself is his only threat, but even then seems rather prosaic and thoughtful about it, like he's done it a hundred times. As a result, there's no growth, no development. This is a shame, because at times Vinny seems like a colourful character, and his family full of feeling and drama, but the film never explores those depths. It's also a shame because on paper it's a truly remarkable story. The kind that has you standing in the aisles applauding. But no, it didn't. It reliably documented that brief period in his life and no more. Except for a clever 60-second montage during the final fight, it missed the KO we so eagerly wanted. 6.5."
" Vinny Pazienza...
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,7,"""Bleed for This"" is a Biography - Sport movie in which we watch the real-life story of World Champion Boxer Vinny Pazienza. While a World Champion Boxer had a near fatal car crash from which it wasn't certain whether he would ever walk again or not. He didn't only walk again but he made one of sport's most incredible comebacks.I really liked this movie because it was based on a real-life story of a great athlete who made the impossible, possible. The direction which was made by Ben Younger who is also the writer of this movie was simply amazing and he presented very well the difficulties and the obstacles that Vinny Pazienza faced and had to overcome in order not only to walk again but to fight. The interpretations of both Miles Teller who played as Vinny Pazienza and Aaron Eckhart who played as Kevin Rooney were simply exceptional. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Ciarán Hinds' who played as Angelo Pazienza and Katey Sagal who played as Louise Pazienza and they both did a great job. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you will love it and after watching it you will remember it for a long time."
" Hard to watch, Brutal, and Beautiful
",2019-12-06 00:00:00,9,Miles Teller is one of the best actors of this time and he delivers in Bleed for This. Aaron Eckhart along with Teller truly carry this film. The supporting cast does a strong job of conveying what a family would feel through all of this. Every boxing movie deals with adversity most sports movies need some form of adversity to make you care. I am happy this film did not fall in line with what is expected from a boxing movie and I was uncomfortable through over half the movie. Check it out.
" Not bad but a bit dull; needed more action.
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,5,"I love boxing movies. And being a big fan of old school boxing; especially of boxing from the 1980's and 1990's where I really was a fan. Not much of a boxing fan now because it's too expensive, I am older now and my interest is not the same as when I was a kid and teenager.Anyway, to this film, I definitely remember and liked Vinny Pazienza and loved his charisma, charm and swag that he brought to the sport of boxing. So, when a movie came out about his life, I was definitely intrigued by it and checked it out on DVD.Overall the acting is wonderful. Miles Teller really did a great job with the role and he made me believe that he was Vinnie in his accent, mannerisms and even hairstyle and pencil thin mustache.My only complaint with the film is that it is very talky. For a boxing film, you want some action to it; especially a boxing film. You need action to go with the drama. And that what Bleed For This lacked. It lacked the action. So, it did get very dull as a film and dragged along.Overall, Bleed For This is a very good boxing drama where there is more drama than boxing action."
" One of the most uplifting boxing films since Rocky and The Fighter
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,10,"This movie has to be one of my new favorite boxing movies. Miles Teller and the guy who played Harvey Dent are amazing together. This is a story of a young man learning to become humble again after losing his humble come up through plain vanity. He humbles himself by almost ruining his own life and learns to fight for himself again and not the the money or the fame. It's really uplifting, especially the speech at the end from Harvey Dent.It's worth your time to sit down and watch this film."
" ""I did it with dogged determination and persistent perseverance!""
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,7,"If it wasn't based on a true story, the saga of boxer Vinny Pacienza would be hard to believe. Suffering a broken neck in a near fatal car accident, the World Lightweight Boxing Champion spends three months recovering with a primitive looking 'Halo' device screwed into his head to impede mobility. Yeah, you read that right, it was literally screwed into his head in four locations so he couldn't accidentally twist his head the wrong way. The alternative was fusion surgery recommended by his doctor, but the stubborn 'Paz' would have none of that.The story here is one of resolute hope and a visionary desire to make a comeback, as Pacienza (Miles Teller) defies the odds of ever even walking again by beginning physical training while still wearing the Halo. He gradually wins over trainer Kevin Rooney (Aaron Eckhart) and family members who want only the best for him, but don't see a way for him to ever be functional again. It's more than a classic underdog story, as you'll come to understand that Pacienza was literally one in a million to overcome his horrific handicap.What fight scenes there are, are done well with excellent choreography. The Super Middleweight title fight against Roberto Duran (Edwin Rodriguez) caps Pacienza's comeback, as he wins the championship against a formidable opponent, and probably a better household name in the world of boxing. But you can't deny Paz's achievement, testifying to the maxim that you can't keep a good man down."
" Truly exciting and inspirational
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,8,Bleed For This is a great boxing movie. World class actors ensure that it doesn't miss a beat. Highly recommended.
" Not another boxing underdog story
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,4,Drawn out and predictable even if you didn't know the original story. I had no empathy for any of the cast especially the lead played by Miles Teller who did his best with a poor script. Just another brooding piece of film making without any redeeming values.
" Worthy story but average
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,5,"There have been many underdog stories based upon real events turned into films. Bleed for this is a decent boxing story and has a nice comeback story but what's wrong with it, is the character of Vinnie wasn't too intriguing and the drama wasn't as intense but far more predictable.In comparisons to the Fighter or Southpaw, those films (especially the Fighter) felt more raw, real and engaging. This film also feels somewhat short in runtime, where of not much of note happens after the car accident especially Vinnie training back into fighting shape. Released back in 2016 and it seems that this film has already been somewhat forgotten."
" Unreal Story
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,10,Being a big boxing fan I remember Vinny Pazienza very well and his story. It was truly inspirational and I'm glad a movie was made about it. Miller Teller did an amazing job as Vinny and Aaron Eckhart nailed it as Kevin Rooney. This film is about more than boxing though; it's about beating the odds at ALL COST!
" Best performances.
",2019-07-08 00:00:00,10,"This is another in a list of fine performances by Miles Teller, who was so good in last year's ""Whiplash."" Here he captures the ego of Pazienza perfectly, making a man whose boasting should make him unlikable actually become someone to care about."
" Good Movie
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,8,"Well acted Movie, wasnt sure at the beginning what kind of movie would turn out to be but by the end felt was really well done. Nothing over the top so if Rocky is your style of boxing movie you may not love this.
I dont think I have a good enough reason to not go to the gym again after seeing this lol"
" I really enjoyed it!!
",2019-04-10 00:00:00,9,Good solid movie. Good acting and just good all around.
" Decent
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,6,"Boxing has cool stories all over throughout the history and this is one of them. A guy comes back from a broken neck to not only compete again but win a world championship. The boxing portions are pretty short but they're for sure better than like Rocky. Something about the script or something just wasn't doing it for me that much. I feel like I should have cared much more than I did. Worth watching, I think Teller did a really good job but I guess I think the script just wasn't up to par."
" True story about a miraculous comeback, great movie
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,8,"The inspirational story of World Champion Boxer Vinny Pazienza who, after a near fatal car crash which left him not knowing if he'd ever walk again, made one of sport's most incredible comebacks. That's the story and it's executed in such a great way, showing that it's well thought out and the filmmakers behind it knew how to tell the story visually and in the writing in the perfect way. Ben Younger truly did an incredible job at directing and doing the screenplay for the movie, he made a great movie and a boxing movie that isn't filled with clichés.The ensemble cast was what gave me the interest to watch it, with names like: Aaron Eckhart, Katey Sagal, Ciarán Hinds and of course Miles Teller that plays Vinny, the main character. It was one of his best and believable performances out of his filmography, behind Thank You for Your Service which was just perfect. But this is another kind of performance as he's portraying a real person and I do believe he did an excellent job at giving Vinny justice."
" ""It's not that simple...""
",2019-02-06 00:00:00,6,"One of the most extraordinary comebacks in boxing sees Vinny ""The Pazmanian Devil"" Pazienza become world champion at two different weights, survive a near-fatal car accident, and train for the chance to fight again albeit against the wishes of medical experts and his family and friends.
This true-to-life story avoids formula in this sub-genre and is crafted with a healthy dose of honesty and characterised by an absorbing theme of redemption. The boxing fights in the story don't actually follow how things really happened in reality so there is some poetic licence but filmically the story works well. It's full of heart and at times cringing stuff."
" Amazing Performance.
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,9,"Miles Teller as the whirlwind boxer Vinny Pazienza was amazing. I didn't know anything about Pazienza before this fight and to be honest I was so glad I didn't. It allowed this film to be completely original for me. I know that the story is a ""true story"" given the fact that there are a few ""cinematic enhancements"", but Teller did an amazing job of portraying the character through the whole range of emotions.For me, this movie largest win wasn't in the ring, but in the audio. The audio design was IMPECCABLE in my opinion. I really geek out in moments of movies where you can FEEL what's happening through the sound and this movie had that in multiple moments. Truly amazing.The film as a whole was a fun ride through the '80s with a dynamic character who ultimately wins both in the ring and in your heart."
" boxer biopic
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,6,"This is a biopic of boxer Vinny Pazienza. He's an obsessed gambler. His boxing is faltering after three consecutive losses. Even his manager advises him to quit in a TV interview. As he makes his comeback, he gets into a car accident on his way to a casino. He is endangered of never walking again. Despite the dangers, he secretly trains with his head halo brace. At first, no one is willing to fight him due to his injury but with some media attention, he gets a title fight with champion Roberto Durán.This is sorta like Rocky without the romance. My only drawback is that I don't love Vinny. It's not that he's mean-spirited or villainous in any way. It's more like he's self-destructive and not in a loveable way. Maybe they could downplay his gambling instead of highlighting it. He's bull-headed which could work during his halo section but it's already used-up by his gambling. Some parts work better than others. The biopic aspects work even if I don't like the content sometimes. There is a stereotypical reality to the characters and Vinny has my grudging respect."
" Well done
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,6,Miles Teller is good and the story interesting. We don't get much below the surface.
" Great inspirational story very well told
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,9,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Bleed for This"" (2016) would be a good but by the number boxing movie except for one major exception - this is absolutely true story and this fact pushes this movie to better heights. This is a great inspirational story about hope and what happens when you don't give up in seemingly a ""no way out"" situation. Miles Teller gives a great performances (one of his best yet). Supporting characters were great as well. Overall, ""Bleed for This"" is a very good movie that shows a highly inspiring story. This is as well a good movie about boxing. It doesn't bring anything new to table, but its a damn good movie."
" Teller is outstanding
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,6,"Miles Teller has become one of, if not the best actor of his generation. He's become equally at home in action, comedy or dramatic roles. He thoroughly surprised me as the Pazmanian Devil, Vinny Pazienza."
" Bleed for Comeback
",2018-06-08 00:00:00,7,"This ain't no 'Rocky' - like some other reviewer said. And I'm clad it ain't no 'Rocky'. 'Bleed for This' doesn't offer anything new in the boxing genre, but it still stands as its own. The script is pretty basic and by the numbers, and mainly carried by the strong performances of the cast - especially Miles Teller who is just superb as Vinny Paz. It treats the viewers with some boxing movie clichés (at the moment I think there is no other way to make them), but they are not too obvious to ruin the experience. The real life story of Vinny Pazienza is incredible and in real life he's much more colorful personality than it was depicted in the film (so were some other characters). In that department, the film played little safe. Of course it's only a movie (a near good one), and it has to leave some room for fantasy and drama. Another thing I liked about the film is that it didn't do much over dramatization like most of the based on true life films (and sporting films in general) tend to do. 'Bleed for This' isn't the greatest film of the year or not even greatest boxing film, but it's one of the best that has come out in recent years. I'm sure this film will gain more appreciation over time.Of course to me, who I'm little boxing enthusiast myself, I always get hyped for another boxing movie. 'Bleed for This' is quite well balanced, paced and acted sporting drama that is definitely worth giving shot at."
" Good movie
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,9,Great inspiring movie the boxing in the film could have been shot better but the emotion of the film and acting was very good. The brotherly relationship that comes in a short time between Paz and Kevin played well with the chemistry between the two actors
" Bleed For This follows the typical boxing drama formula, but if ain't broke don't fix it.
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,7,"I do love me a good sports drama, it's like watching the event live on television. I'm always sitting upright shouting ""Go on! Get in there! Phwoarr!"". And Bleed For This is no different. The incredible true story of Vinny Pazienza who, after a near fatal car accident, is unable to walk again let alone fight. However, through perseverance and determination he did just that. It takes many aspects from other modern boxing dramas. We have a hearty family full of sisters (The Fighter), an accident that causes a severe injury (Million Dollar Baby) and a sea of self-determination (Creed, Southpaw...the list goes on). Whilst admittedly those films are better as a whole, this is still an enjoyable film about battling through adversity. True story aside, the characters are brought to life by electrifying performances. Miles Teller transformed himself into the role. Aaron Eckhart played the coach role perfectly, with a subtle comedic undertone. The stand out, for me, was Ciaran Hinds who stole every scene. Pushing his son constantly to fight and then his character starts to develop and evokes empathy. I sympathised with him. Seeing your own flesh and blood getting punched to death at a risk he may lose his life, Hinds just looked on with fear! Extremely overlooked performance. Ben Younger's direction was solid throughout, however his screenplay was extremely inconsistent. Particularly during the second act where I felt disconnected with the story. Lacked emotion. The script just wasn't memorable or poignant enough for me to care. In saying that, Younger brings it back with the final boxing match which was electrifyingly powerful. Extremely well filmed with nice long shots! I felt every punch and was sold by Teller's physical performance. You could see the frustration in his eyes. All the pain he has been through, put into the match of his life. Brilliant. I just wished the second act was as resonating. Aside from that, a damn decent boxing drama."
" Not worth the claret!
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,5,"I never imagined that Aaron Eckhart would make a good Kevin Rooney... but he really does - so well done to him and the casting department for absolutely nailing the part.Everything else is one step above your typical Lifetime movie, and not worth the investment. It seems to have only been made because it has an ostensibly 'feelgood' ending, and a traditional three act structure of establishment, setback, and triumphant return.It's blindingly obvious even before watching that he's a competitive person - all successful sports people are. Here, though, competitiveness is turned into a fetish; something to be reveled in, at any cost. It's the straight laced and serious version of the Monty Python ""it's just a flesh wound!"" gag. Weaker moments of doubt are treated as just minor bumps on the inevitable road to victory.Personally, I would've rooted harder for the guy if he was ever made EMOTIONALLY vulnerable at any point - not just physically frail, through injury.REAL bravery would be exploring different parts of your life and blossoming as a person - not staying stuck on the same track and ignoring the advice of others, because your conception of life is the only one that you know how to make work... If fighting is 'all you know how to do', then you're one dimensional, and uninteresting... Sadly, this means that, so is the movie.Right down to the title, this is macho horse manure... Bleed for WHAT, exactly? Because you're used to it?! Nuts to that. Expand your horizons!"
" Thoroughly enjoyable
",2017-11-13 00:00:00,8,"Maybe it's the truly amazing turn of events that Vinny went through that makes me give this a high score, but I also love an American sports film. This made 'Bleed For This' right up my street.It's not up in the heady heights of Rocky. But it's easily as good a film as Creed for me.Miles Teller is wonderful, and I really did root for him in this. I was completely unaware of Vinny Pazienza, and I'm more than happy with this film telling me his story.A solid 8 out of 10, and well worth a watch if you like a good underdog film."
" I just wanted more of some parts and far less of others.
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,7,"Bleed for This (2016) This is a biographical sports film based on the life of former world champion boxer Vinny Pazienza. The film stars Miles Teller, with Aaron Eckhart, Katey Sagal, and Ted Levine in supporting roles. It received generally positive reviews but was a box office disappointment. It received little to no award recognition. It's not that it's a bad film. The problem is it's a boxing film about a man's comeback and redemption. It means it will be immediately compared to Rocky. This is a disadvantage to these types of films and requires them to step up their game. This film failed in some aspects, but did well in others. I wanted some more background in the beginning and some parts of the film could have been tightened up to allow for this. It seems either the editing or writing was flawed. I just wanted more of some parts and far less of others."
" Offers nothing good
",2017-10-12 00:00:00,5,"'Bleed for This' is about as ""by the book"" as movies come sadly. It's based on a true story, but in a lot of ways it does a disservice to the real story. First of all, the main character Vinny Pazienza is portrayed in a very unbelievable way. The movie goes out of its way to make him seem like an absolute saint, for no reason other than that we are supposed to root for him. I would've preferred his character actually had some realistic outbursts and we weren't necessarily rooting for him. It would have made the whole experience feel more authentic.The first half hour of the film, the set-up phase, is pretty dull and uninteresting and is going to lose a lot of people right there and then. The middle third of the film is certainly the most interesting. His dealing with the accident and the recovery side of things is far more interesting than the parts that should have been the most exciting at the beginning and end (go figure).'Bleed for This' does nothing to stand out from the crowds of movies being put forward today. The only people I can see getting any enjoyment out of this film are people who have a love for boxing or a particular interest in this story. For everyone else though, give it a miss."
" A boxing drama that fails to connect
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,4,"After some big hits and more than a few misses, the boxing film has been a long time staple of our multiplexes and a sub-genre of sporting film that has provided us with some of cinema's all-time great feel good or dramatic experiences.For each new boxing film that comes out, they now need to work harder and their punches need to land a bigger impact than the one before them and sadly Bleed for This doesn't manage to climb above its genre tropes to become anything more than a tolerable boxing drama that's void of the emotion that makes similar films like Rocky, Raging Bull and Creed work on a whole different level.Telling the true life story of famous 1980's American boxer Vinny Pazienza, Boiler Room director Ben Younger netted himself quiet the double bill of rising star Miles Teller to play the determined and feisty Pazienza and an overweight and balding method partaking Aaron Eckhart as Pazienza's friend and trainer Kevin Rooney but Younger and the well-regarded duo fail to connect us emotionally to Pazienza's fight to overcome an horrific car crash injury to box once more.Both performers are solid in their roles, even if they feel more like imitations rather than full-fledged flesh and blood reincarnations but we're never allowed deep into what makes these two different figures tick and despite the trial over adversity nature of what's often occurring within Bleed for This, at the end of the day without the emotionally investment it's too easy to not care.The film as it stands also marks another disappointing experience from Teller in particular, who it could be argued goes a little to ""awards baiting"" here in his turn as Pazienza There's nothing majorly wrong with his performance but after Teller's early breakouts in films like Whiplash and The Spectacular Now, the failure as a whole of Bleed for This alongside recent Teller events like Fantastic Four, Get a Job and the Divergent series mark a point in the young actors career when he is all of a sudden crying out for a decent hit and an individual role that once more utilises his undeniable talent.Final Say – There's nothing in Bleed for This that makes it a must-see. For the most die-hard of boxing fans and those that consider themselves Pazienza fans Younger's film may be worthy of your time but for the rest of us, we've seen this type of boxing tale before countless times and with nothing new on the table presented here, it makes Bleed for This an instantly forgettable and rather unnecessary experience.2 screws out of 5"
" Great story, bad execution by the director. 5/10
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,5,"Review: This is another one of those movies, which has an amazing true story as the backdrop but the director failed to execute it well. All of the actors gave it there all but I personally wouldn't have picked Miles Teller to play the lead, mainly because he didn't have the charismatic persona like the real Vinny Pazienza, who would also frighten you if you saw him down a dark alley. Anyway, this movie starts with Vinny losing to Roger Mayweather, and after a few loses under his belt, his business partners decide to bring in a new trainer, Kevin Rooney (Aaron Eckhart), who previously trained Mike Tyson. He instantly sees potential in Vinny but he has a few bad habits, and a cocky attitude, which he soon manages to ditch from his fighting methods. He also makes him step up two weights in his fighting class, because he struggles to keep the weight down, mainly because of his lack of strict training before a fight. After winning there first belt together, there is big plans for Vinny but he ends up in a terrible car crash, which damages his neck. With the odds against him, and everyone saying that he won't be fighting again, Vinny takes matters into his own hands, and starts training in the family basement, with Kevin's help. With screws in his head, and the danger of making his injuries worse, Vinny and Kevin train hard, and when the screws finally come out, he's determined to have another fight. He then hits the gym, and his business partners manage to get him a fight against Duran, which goes down as one of the best fights in boxing history. It is an heroic story, which has the potential to make a great movie but the director spent to much time on trivial moments, which made the movie drag. I did feel for Vinny, when his head had the ""halo"" around it, and his courage and determination was pretty remarkable but Miles Teller failed to bring emotion to the project, which I mainly blame on the director. The movie also looked like it was cheaply made, and the fight scenes seemed a bit messy, and unexciting. Anyway, it's worth a watch, mainly because of the amazing true story but it's definitely not in the same class as the Rocky movies. Average!Round-Up: This movie was directed and written by Ben Younger, 44, who also brought you Boiler Room & Prime, starring Meryl Streep & Uma Thurman. With not that much experience behind the camera, he wouldn't have been my first choice to bring such a great story to the big screen, so maybe that's why it didn't go down to well with audiences. After watching Vinny's real fights, which did leave me on the edge of my seat, I can only hope that a top director will take on his life story, which really does need to be told.Budget: $6million Worldwide Gross: $6.7millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/sport/dramas, starring Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart, Katey Sagal, Ciaran Hinds, Ted Levine and Amanda Clayton. 5/10"
" It is easy to give up
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,10,"The film is based on the true boxing story of World Champion Boxer Vinny Pazienza (Miles Teller). It starts with his defeat in November of 1988 to Roger Mayweather (Peter Quillin). It appeared his career was a wash and after a training music montage he won the second fight of the film, 30 minutes into it with the training help of Aaron Eckhart, going whiplash all over Gilbert Dele. The fight was a set up and he was expected to lose. Paz gets into an auto accident and the bulk of the film is about his remarkable comeback.The film skips a few fights in between. Paz didn't go from training to title bout as the film portrays, forgivable for time considerations. I thought the acting was excellent, decent New England accents. At the end of the film you get to see the real characters on which the production was based and they looked were remarkably similar. Good casting. Good film for the genre. Good sound track.Guide: F-word. Nudity ( Noelle Trudeau, Christine Evangelista)"
" True to its Time
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,9,"A biopic about Vinny ""The Tasmanian Devil"" Paz - a boxer who came back from a broken neck (sustained in a car crash) to fight again. His career total being 40 wins in 50 fights. Some fights and events are compressed to make the film work.Set in the late 80's and filmed entirely on location in Rhode Island around his native town of Cranston - the film incorporates real TV footage of the period in the background as presenters and local stations cover his chances of fighting again. (Hilarious in some cases as the gray haired presenters are still with us now!) The film certainly demonstrates Paz's sheer guts and determination to train again while wearing his ""halo"" collar drilled into his skull to hold his neck straight while the vertebrae heal. (Years ago I had a staff member also wearing a halo collar while he recovered from a broken neck - this part is really well portrayed).Living in Rhode Island I'm familiar with the area portrayed - the close up camera style and cars and housing all ring VERY true. Though I deny any familiarity with the ""Foxy Lady"" gentleman's club - also portrayed......If you sat up for the ""Thrilla in Manila"" and the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" - then this movie shows boxing of the period in the lighter divisions. If boxing isn't your thing - you might want to give it a miss - the fights are particularly well staged."
" Born again to reach the sky.
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,8,"I definitely did not expect it. It's a biographical-sport-drama, that tells an inspiring story of a talented young American boxer who faced the biggest setback in his career after met with a car crash. The remaining parts focused on how he struggles to come back, while recovering from the serious injury.The biggest advantage was the cast. I particularly liked Miles Teller in the lead role. His recent rise in the Hollywood was phenomenal and this one is his another must watch film. Even the supporting cast and roles were awesome. If you are a boxing/sports film fan, you will love it. But there is sufficient drama in the tale to build an impressive storyline.Feels like it is under-appreciated, and being a Hollywood film, the recognition was too poor. In the coming days, years, it will reach the largest audience coverage. From this film, the director is the one who gained big. Surely he should make use of its success to his next films. Because I'll be expecting much better and bigger than this. This film is one of the best of the years, so don't miss it.8/10"
" Punching above its weight.
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,7,"There is nothing very groundbreaking about the style or narrative arc of this wee gem; there have been more realistic and more intense boxing scenes over the years, more emotional ones too, but where Bleed For This wins is in the casting and the superb performances from Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Ciaran Hinds, all doing incredible character work, with hair second only to anything in American Hustle.Directed with a fondness for the late 80s and a good eye for detail, we come to care about this story purely because Miles Teller makes us care - real, energetic and unsentimental, he takes us on the journey with him every step and every punch. That it is all very predictable and mostly lacking in tension in the ring doesn't stop it being a powerful film, just because the relationships are so well drawn.No Warrior. No Rocky, even. But a decent small story remarkable in its truth."
" Could've been great
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,6,"I think Miles is the only one trying to act in this movie and not pantomime his character like other's seem to do. I get the whole New York/New Jersey thing but come on, not every girlfriend is slut and not every Sister is a bully. If this was portrayed in any of the promos, I wouldn't have watched it. I can't stand loud, bossy, bullying women or the men who are around them. If Vinnie was like this in real life, then he truly was and still is an inspiration but his family of women were not entertaining to watch. My guess is that he had to placate them even on film. Other than that, the movie is alright on it's own as his true story of over-coming pain, disappointment and a strong need to feel validated. I don't say vindicated because he was already before his accident, he just couldn't stop until HE was ready."
" Fantastic True Comeback Story
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,9,Wow! Miles Teller is phenomenal in this story of a boxer that is in a horrific car accident that breaks his neck and then surpasses all odds to mount a comeback and fight in the ring once more. It is baffling that this is a true story and I had not heard hide nor hare of before seeing this movie. Aaron Eckhart and Katey Sagal are practically unrecognizable. All of the actors throw themselves into their roles with abandon. Fantastic truly fantastic. Engaging and enjoyable watching this film.
" A triumphant story on Vinny. But the film is slightly dull.
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,6,"Bleed for This a sports drama based on the champion boxer Vinny Pazienza and the accident that almost left him paralyzed. It does not stop him on the road to recovery in training to get back into the boxing ring. These films are suppose to make you feel a little inspirational seeing real life situations happening to real people. The film does show very little for the inspiration. Vinny (Miles Teller) is a cocky boxer, who rigs his body weight to meet the requirements. After the car accident, that leaves him wearing a halo ring on his neck for six months to recover. And the doctors telling him he is unable to ever go back in the ring. He spends his day, eating junk food, watching day time TV, going to strip clubs, and hanging out with his personal trainer Kevin (Aaron Eckhart). Vinny decides that he needs to work harder to train himself to get back into the ring against the doctors wishes. The positive things about Bleed for This is it tries to have a fun sense of 1980s direction with the music soundtrack. Also, the inspirational true story about a boxer never letting a severe injury from stopping him to doing what he is inspired to do. The climax of the boxing match as Vinny is risking himself from severing his spinal cord from a single bad throw that can paralyze him was cringe worthy. Also, Miles Teller did a great job in portraying Vinny Pazienza. Aaron Eckhart playing a balding out of shape trainer was also good. The negative thing about the film besides knowing how the turn out and what will happen to the character ends. I felt like the direction could have been a little stronger with its inspirational tone. The film does so well in trying to have a fun 80s tone, or delivering great performances with the cast. To make you feel for the moment and making it memorable unlike the others does not have much going for the movie. It can get pretty slow in the middle of the film until Vinny tries to lift weights while recovering. The music score Julia Holter does so little in making a memorable score besides having a couple of beat down 80s song. Overall, Bleed for This is a fair sports drama film that has good talent, and an inspired concept but does so little with trying so hard on making the movie emotional. The hard recovery the boxer went through will be inspired as a strong motivation but the film sadly will easily be forgotten. I will rate the film 3 out of 5 stars."

" Good Movie... Just Not Realistic
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,7,"Bleed For This is a good movie. The acting in it is decent and the story is a great one to tell. When it was over, I thought, ""That was really quite good, but something was wrong."" The more I though about it, the more problems I had with it. And the biggest problem lied with the direction and casting.All the actors did a decent job doing what they were told to do. Everyone in the film are all good actors and did what they could with what they had. They problem was they didn't have enough to work with. I have to blame the writer, director and makeup people for that. I was a Vinnie Paz fan back in the day and I never saw Miles Teller, or any of the other characters in the movie, really pull off their characters. Hollywood is really, really good at making actors look, talk and act like the people they are trying to portray in real life. Jaime Foxx looked and acted EXACTLY like Ray Charles. Charlize Theron looked and acted EXACTLY like Aileen Wuornos. No one looked or acted like any of the people they were portraying. Miles Teller didn't look or act anything like Pazienza. Aaron Eckhart did a great job. But he didn't look a bit like Kevin Rooney. I could not even tell who was playing Lou Duva, because no one even came close. It was obvious no one looked at any tape or studied any of the characters they were portraying.Vinnie was a 5'7"", stocky, brash, cocky, arrogant, flashy guy with a thick accent and bad attitude and difficult to like. Miles Teller is over 6 foot tall, lanky and showed none of the personal characteristics boxing fans loved to hate about Paz. They didn't even cut Teller's hair or give him the attitude to resemble him. He looked and acted nothing like him. Eckhart did well putting some character in the show, but was about 40 pounds shy of Rooney and looked nothing like him. When you are watching a biography story and no one looks or acts like they people the story is about, it makes it hard to pay attention to the story. I don't blame the actors for any of this. I blame the writers, directors and make up people. They are the ones who are supposed to be paying attention to details like this. The actors look how the director wants them to and do what the director tells them to do. If the director wants a flashy personality out of his star character, he should tell him to do it. I think they went much more subdued to make the character more likable. And that is a shame.If you can get past that, the fantastic story makes the movie, overall, worth watching. In fact, if you never knew anything about the actual people in the movie, you would not notice my problems with it. It just seemed lazy to me and they could have done so much more to better represent the real people if they put some extra thought and heart into it and portrayed the characters more true to life."
" Lame Boxing Scenes almost Kills the Film.
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,8,"Darn. Just darn! If the boxing matches in this film were filmed a hell of a lot better, this film would have been nominated for picture of the year and etc, etc. The film is shot well but like I said before, the action choreography cheapens the film, and that is a darn shame because this isn't just your average Rocky-knockoff boxing picture. This film is based on a true story. This review will avoid any spoilers because that is how I went into this film and I'm better for it. All I knew about this film was that it is a boxing movie. I didn't even know it was based on a true story, they should have marketed it that way. This is a great film regardless of the action's short comings. After watching the film, I went as far as to look into the life of the boxer this film is based on. It all happened just like the film depicts. They do skip a few minor fights to add dramatic flare but whatever. But yeah, shame how the dramatic tension falls flat whenever he steps into the boxing ring. It is painful but I have to give this film a seven out of ten... maybe a 7.5 out of ten but I'll round up because the whatever and blah."
" The Vidiot Reviews...
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,6,"Bleed for This Boxing isn't that dangerous; it's the only sport you don't need a jockstrap to play.In fact, the pugilist in this sports-drama wasn't paralyzed anywhere near a ring.Vinny Paz (Miles Teller) is a junior welterweight who can't make his division so his father (Ciarán Hinds) hires Tyson's old trainer Kevin Rooney (Aaron Eckhart) to assist.While his father doesn't approve of pushing his son into a new weight class, Vinny's junior middleweight world championship changes all that.So, too, does the car accident that leaves him with a medical halo screwed into his skull. But even that's isn't enough to keep Vinny from the ring.The mediocre retelling of the amazing recovery that took the boxing community by surprise in the early nineties, this true story's charm lies in its dedicated performances, not in its timeworn underdog prizefighter narrative.Anecdotally, the next weight class in boxing after heavyweight is sumo.

" A very good sports movie that I recommend & enjoyed. More so probably because I didn't know anything about the actual events
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,8,"""I ain't done yet. I got more in me."" Vinny Pazienza (Teller) is one of the world's best boxers. He is a champion, but his arrogance causes him to stumble and is on the edge of losing it all. After being tossed away by everyone he finds a new trainer in Kevin Rooney (Eckhart). Soon they both become part of one of the greatest comebacks in sports history. I am a sucker for sports movies and I was looking forward to watching this one. I was not disappointed at all. The movie is more Hands of Stone than Rocky but that in no way is a bad thing. Teller is a great choice for this and since he is still relatively lesser known, and disguises himself so well in this he really becomes and is believable as Vinny. Much like Rocky the focus is on the boxer himself and not the boxing aspect. That also really helps you become invested in the character and movie. I knew nothing about this story before the movie so that also may have helped. The one thing Rocky did for sports movies, boxing movies in general, is really make you wonder what the outcome will be. That tiny aspect also really had an impact that helped the movie. Overall, a very very good sports movie that I recommend and enjoyed. More so probably because I didn't know anything about the actual events. I give this a B+."
" Has its moments, but is miscast and desperately seeking Oscar
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,5,"Vinny ""Pazmanian Devil"" Pazienza is a troublesome character to frame as a hero. He's been through some disconcerting things in his private life, such as assault and allegations of domestic abuse. ""Bleed for This"" portrays this aspect of Vinny's life as a fun, good ol' boy routine of fun romps to the strip club and passive gambling, with his beautiful girlfriend in tow. When she gives up on him halfway through the film, it's not because of his abusive behavior - but rather, because she doesn't love him enough to deal with his neck brace device and the fact that it's restricting their love life. The movie effectively portrays her as the bad person.It is Hollywood, so of course there will be historical inaccuracies. But ""Bleed for This"" desperately wants to be the next ""Raging Bull,"" yet it doesn't have the conviction or the guts to show the demons of Paz the way the latter film did for Jake LaMotta. You can't try to turn a man of questionable moral fiber into Rocky Balboa and then also try to posit your film as a hard-hitting true story when omitting important facts. Miles Teller has received waves of bad press in the last couple years. He was great in ""Whiplash,"" but it seemed a bit of an in the right place at the right time casting decision. In most of his other films he has been smug and detached to a disadvantage. Ostensibly, this should work in ""Bleed for This,"" highlighting Paz's smarmy charm, but Teller just doesn't have the acting or the physical chops to really drive the performance home. The movie doesn't help this by frequently showing footage of the real Paz (e.g. at a late night TV show appearance), who was short, stocky, and menacing in stature. Teller, with his peach fuzz mustache and lanky build, never really comes across as doing anything more than posturing. Even for the film's physical transformation scenes, he's lacking - there's a before-and-after drawn during Paz's rehabilitation, not to mention a scene that highlights the fact that he has jumped up two entire weight classes... and yet Teller, often with his shirt off, consistently looks exactly the same, and never looks any more or less out of shape or any larger or smaller. Aaron Eckhart, shaving his head back and growing a paunch, is OK but not given much more to work with than the tired cliché of the boxing trainer. You know the character. Forest Whitaker just played him in Southpaw a couple years ago. Eckhart, like everyone else involved in the film, seems convinced that he's in an awards-worthy role, but frankly the writing is never up to par, which makes his performance seem a little overzealous, like he's trying a little too hard to solidify his Oscar chances.The best aspect of the film is its direction, by Ben Younger. The problem is that the script lets him down - after an interesting first 45 minutes which takes its time setting up the characters, the pivotal car accident happens... and the movie kind of blows past Paz's recovery. One minute doctors are telling him he might never even walk again, then he begins training...and suddenly he's back in the boxing ring again. One gets the impression that there was probably a lot of content in the middle portion of the film that was left on the cutting room floor, possibly in an effort by the studio to bring a 2.5 hour film down to just under 2 hours. It feels rushed and sloppy. Overall this is a decent, sporadically interesting one-time viewing, but some of that interest derives from the miscalculation by so many involved (both behind the camera and in front of it). From the miscast lead role to the clunky screenplay to the questionable decision to turn Vinny into a hero figure, the movie has too much working against it to even consider itself in the same league as the great boxing movies it so desperately wants to emulate."
" Does Justice To Truly Amazing Story
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,7,"Bleed For This is not just another boxing movie. True, the story is a variation of the standard one, but this movie differentiates itself because it's about the true life career of Vinny Pazienza. Pazienza's a walking miracle as it was not certain after a horrific auto accident he'd live let alone be able to walk again. The fact that he resumed his boxing career winning another world title is why this story stands alone. This is a singular comeback which is likely never to be eclipsed in the most unforgiving of all sports.The viewer will certainly enjoy the well re-enacted boxing scenes, they are solid, but the crux of this movie is Pazienza/s world outside the ring. He's a driven and focused athlete whose long- shot status, uber Italian family, and famous, ""has been"", coach add tons of color - and that's before he almost loses his life setting up his virtually impossible comeback. Miles Teller is absolute perfection as Pazienza. His performance truly brings this fantastic story to life. Aaron Eckhart as trainer Kevin Rooney shines to. It's Eckhart like I've never seen him and he surprises in a good way. Another performance of merit is Irish actor Ciaran Hinds portrayal of Pazienza's father Angelo. Hinds gets his WAP (not meant in any derogatory way) on here so good it defines the term ""inhabiting a character"". All in all a miraculous sport's and life story told well. See this one, you'll be entertained as well as uplifted."
" Bleed for This (2016)
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,7,"The first thing that caught my attention in regards to this film was the promotion with Billy Squier's ""The Stroke"". I generally tend to enjoy boxing movies despite not really liking sports films. Boxing films can often be formulaic, clichéd, or familiar but I really just enjoy a good underdog story with good boxing scenes. Even though I don't follow the sport at all anymore (the transition to UFC/MMA has been a blessing), I still think boxing movies can be a lot of fun.Bleed For This is based on the true story of American Italian boxer Vinny Pazienza and his comeback from a near career ending spinal injury. I assume the film is pretty accurate as a biopic. Miles Teller as Paz starts off as an arrogant, brass, but dedicated boxer. At first he realizes the weight cut for his division was hard for him so he moves up two weight classes and takes on a champion (who also happens to be a favorite). Paz wins the title but shortly afterwards gets into a terrible car crash. From there the comeback story comes on.In terms of treading familiar ground, Bleed for This is full of boxing clichés and tropes that we have seen in many films before. Not that its a bad thing, if you can stomach it. Its a decent boxing tale and a comeback story for a determined boxer. Its not really something you are going to think about after its done. In fact, the film may exit your mind entirely afterwards. What it does offer is a dedicated performance from Miles Teller, and transformative appearances from both Ciaran Hinds and Aaron Eckhart. I had a hard time recognizing either. I don't think I've really seen Christine Evangelista in much else but wow is she nice to look at.Overall, this film is exactly what you would expect. If you don't watch it you aren't missing anything. If you do watch it you will enjoy it for what it is even if the story has been told a million times. If you are like me (a film enthusiast who just has to watch everything) you will find a nice balance and really take the film for what it really is. And that is, a harmless sports film that looks to inspire and does enough to make a decent popcorn film.7/10"
" Motivation is key
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,9,"This is an excellent movie even for people that don't really enjoy boxing. This movie goes way beyond the sport. It's the mindset behind it that is portrayed. If you feel down and needs a heads up: this is the movie to watch!After this movie, ask yourself again, what are my goals? Once you figured that out, it is easy, just do it, and ace it and never look back just focus on your goal and never stop.I know it is easier said than done, there are going to be hurdles trying to stop you, but you just need to keep going. you are the star"
" Never retreat, never surrender!
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,8,"Feeling the lack is the first step to greatness. If you're fine with status quo you may never achieve something bigger. I'm pretty sure I have read something like this somewhere. At least it's a fitting motto to Bleed for This"", the sports movie about this real-life young boxing champ who broke his neck and still managed to get back in form and claim another world champion belt. More than that, Wikipedia says that he held it for over the next ten years. The guy's called Vinny Paz and he's 54 now, by the way.So yes, it's another sports movie aiming to the infinity and beyond"" but it doesn't go all Hollywood on our asses and actually manages to be a really good indie watch, having both heart and balls.Bleed for This"" came out back in September and circled some festivals before reaching cinemas. The commercial success of the movie, sadly, hasn't been worthy of its tough-as-nails hero. It pretty much came and disappeared without a splash and hasn't gotten any award nominations either, big or small. Quite why the producers and distributors didn't believe in the project enough to support it some, for Globes and Academy Awards campaign, at least, is beyond my comprehension. It's a true underdog story, also a sports movie – who doesn't like those, eh? – and also good movie in general. (Probably the post-Trumpian USA needs more unpretentious happy tales like La La Land"" which has just managed to pick 7 out of 7 Globes.)OK but what makes Bleed for This"" so great, then? Isn't there enough underdog and sports movies, award-winning or otherwise? Well, I am glad you asked. In short, I like everything about it! The indie style, the atmosphere and feeling of the early 1990's working class USA, the great group of starring actors, the hardhitting boxing, the screenplayThe result is not perfect – what is, anyway? – and one could nitpick about many things if wanted to. For example, the movie runs near two hours which is not exactly a short amount of time but one does not get a good sense of Vinny Paz's development as a champion sportsman, or even exactly how the recovery from the big accident went. Of course, it's all explained in passing, but it doesn't satisfy to the fullest.Maybe it's just me because I enjoyed visiting Vinny's world, family and environment so much that I left the cinema wanting more. Bleed for This"" is one of those rather uncommon sports movies that is not afraid to let characters and story breathe and develop enough to lure us in, to make us want really be there for the characters, not just flashy action.This kind of intimate connection to the movie mostly happens when its makers have strong personal connection with the whole thing too. Seeing that Ben Younger is the director and the sole writer, we can assume it was a personal project and he makes the most out of everybody on screen.The big name actors here are Miles Teller as Vinny Paz, Ciarán Hinds as his father (somehow I always confuse the guy with Alfred Molina) and Aaron Eckhart as his boxing trainer. All the others have given good performances too, but these three are really worth every penny the producers had to spend on them. Which was probably not too much because the budget was about 6 million US dollars and shooting lasted for only 24 days.They play it rough and raw, turning the characters into believable working-class heroes. Mark Wahlberg would have probably loved to be part of this experience. There are no showoff scenes so there's not much to talk about it, only enjoy it. Feel it, live it, breathe it!I am especially happy about Aaron Eckhart choosing a worthwhile acting role again for a change. For most of the current decade, he has been doing boring commercial crap which is a world away from the works that made him known in the first place. Here he seems to channel a younger less fat version of James Gandolfini which is enough for me to wish him a Supporting Actor Oscar, or at least a nomination. And last but certainly not the least, Bleed for This"" cements Miles Teller's position as one of the most promising young American movie actors of his generation. You almost remember him from big studio projects Divergent"" + Insurgent"" and 2015's Fantastic Four"" but he has also starred in a row of cool indie-er movies such as The Spectacular Now"" and Whiplash"". The former quirky cool guy has transformed himself for the never- surrender-type boxer role but manages to turn what on paper seems like a cartoon character into living breathing human being. He should also get nominated for Oscar.Ben Younger has previously only written and directed two feature length movies, 2000's really good Boiler Room"" and 2005's rather meh Prime"". It's nice to see him back with another success!""Bleed for This"" doesn't offer a biggest amount of boxing I have seen in a boxing movie. But I just read from IMDb that Teller was trained by Darrell Foster, who has trained fighters like Sugar Ray Leonard and helped Will Smith become Muhammad Ali for 2001's Ali."
