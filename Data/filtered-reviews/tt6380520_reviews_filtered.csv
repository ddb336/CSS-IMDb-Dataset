" A Great Indian Thriller; Suspense till the last scene.
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,8,"A very simple murder mystery but as the movie proceeds it gets complicated and more complicated till the end of the Movie. The climax is unimaginable let alone predictable. Really liked it and Complete credit goes to the director Karthick Naren.

" should be on netflix
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,10,"After the trailer impressed quiet a number of people, I had an impression that this will be yet another movie which fools around with its trailer. Karthik Naren proved me wrong.Never seen such a dark crime thriller in Thamizh Cinema. I must say, no one expected such a young lad to perform this much.The cinematic dark tone, grippy BGM, Screenplay treatment, Almost perfect Casting, makes this a must watch movie.Although this is not a perfect movie, having its own loopholes, it still stands out from the crowd.Thamizh Cinema is indeed evolving."
" A Pointless Thriller
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,4,"Just another random, forced thriller that has got a typical Indian masala movie ending. Again, an ending to show a thriller look, only to end up on a yawning mood. Watch only if you've got nothing better to watch"
" Damn good thriller. Excellent screenplay.
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,10,"Acting, screenplay, music executed to almost perfection.
Can't believe I dint know about this move since 2 years."
" A rise of Murder Mystery Crime Noir in Tamil Cinema comes like a TV Serial.
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,7,"Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru (2016) :
Brief Review -A rise of Murder Mystery Crime Noir in Tamil Cinema comes like a TV Serial. Don't we all watch TV shows/serials like CID, Crime Petrol, Saavdhaan India etc. where they show us Crime Incidents happened in our country and how police solved the cases? Tamil Film Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru makes a solid 90 mins episode like those serials but just comes in chronological and little suspenseful manners. The film is about a retired police officer who recalls his last case before the accident that caused him to quit his profession. Unlike some other outdated thrillers, this film looks quite original and unpredictable and yes it does have shocking elements in the climax portion but like i said it comes like serial. The execution is sort of low quality and the narration truly doesn't look like a feature film. It has pieces joined to make one episode and so the overall usability of the screenplay doesn't look outstanding. Nevertheless, it is a Great Thriller by all means especially for someone who hasn't seen so many quality thrillers. The acting is fantastic, the writting is reasonable, the screenplay is engaging, the editing is tight, the cinematography looks fine and the Direction is nice too. There is nothing much wrong about the film except the fact that we don't expect such a murder mystery from Tamil industry which is highly obsessed with mainstream filmmaking. However, this attempt is praiseworthy and this might bring lots of changes in filmmaking when next time someone try doing such things and that feature film quality might come soon. So, a fantastic attempt, hopefully this rise of Murder Mystery Crime Noir in Tamil Cinema may provide us some high quality stuff soon.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest"
" One of the best thrillers of Tamil cinema
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,10,Thought provokingSeat edge thrillerNo songsNo actionPlot twistAre the words I will use to describe the movie. This movie is a gem of Tamil cinema and every cinema lovers must watch this film.
" ""Life changes so much when a decision is made in the state of emotional peak""
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,10,A classic and Intelligent thriller. The lead actor delivers his top notch performance. The story is simple yet narrative is based on perceptions and that's what keep the viewers glued to their seat till the end.The final line (as written in the header of this review) is just class apart makes the entire plot & characters relatable.
" Too many plot holes and just average direction
",2020-09-25 00:00:00,6,"How can a police officer who has taken a shine to a new recruit completely lose track of him after their almost fatal accident? How can a smart recruit who keeps surprising his boss on the first day of his job misunderstand his boss's motives? How can someone who has seen a short glimpse of someone while driving on a poorly lit flyover remember it well enough after 5 years of coma to recognise it the instant they see it? Why does your own son not come and meet you in your office or leave a message at your desk to call him up in a major emergency that involves him killing someone and his girlfriend getting raped? How can someone have the foresight to lie about their own name to someone who they are stalking? And why would you even tell them your name in the first place?And the main police officer seems like a caricature of a smart cop.. looking for validation from a new recruit and having a terribly incompetent team around him. That's now how a good cop functions at all.. anyway.. I did like the pacing of the film, but the ending was especially bad. There was no reason for the death of the main guy (Deepak) and there was really no reason for the recruit (Gautham) to kill him to avenge 5 years of his life lost.. why didn't he kill the murderer instead? And did he really not trust or respect his boss and mentor enough to listen to their reasons for doing something? Uff.. I just hated the ending.. could've been done so much better"
" It was mind blowing movie
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,10,What a movie. Cant predict the ending untill the final minutes. I think this is one of the best thrilling movie in the world. I recommend it to watch you all.
" Twists are here
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,9,It is an amazing movie which moves with the complicated path. The final twist of the flim is unexpected. It makes us impressed.
" Watchable but forgetful
",2020-09-08 00:00:00,6,"The movie is good but not worthy of 8 + ratingsThe movie has very good moments but no jaw dropping or extraordinary moments that will stay with you for a long time.
Decent story line
Good climax
Good acting by the main lead"
" Indian Cinema needs more such Crime Mystery Thrillers
",2020-09-08 00:00:00,9,"The storyline of this film is very clever. The plot builds up and slowly the mystery unfolds. Direction is also good. The lead role character (played by Rahman) is outstanding throughout.
Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru is a low budget movie BUT a Masterpiece.
One of the best crime mystery films, Indian cinema has ever produced."
" Best movie with superb screen play
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,9,"I think the movie just amazing because we cannot guess anything
We have twists every single minute
The best movie in Tamil I have ever seen"
" Must watch if you like dark suspense thriller
",2020-08-06 00:00:00,9,"Watched this movie in Hindi language. Starting of the movie was vary basic and slow but 2nd half of the movie will surprise you. Plot twist till the last minute of the movie.Story told very well
9 out of 10 from me"
" Engaging, even though fizzles in the climax.
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,7,"Pros:
1. Star cast feels genuine and each one fits well in their respective characters.
2. No disturbances by loud music(either background score or soundtrack), the viewer can focus on the flow. The credits score is good to listen.
3. They have kept the length of the movie in accordance with the screenplay.Cons:
When the movie started, I told my wife that this guy is definitely not Deepak's friend's son(one can tell this after watching a couple of thrillers). As the movie progresses, the loopholes in the screenplay hint an experienced viewer about the upcoming disappointment in the climax e.g: Deepak doesn't even note Vaishnavi's phone number (later, asks the neighbor), she is able to leave without any hassles, the lack of camera coverage at the crime scene (and Deepak not asking any questions, yet comes up with the theory!), not tracing Shruti's phone or call history, Deepak being unconcerned about someone standing outside his house for long, and so on. Of course, the climax is unconvincing.Overall, the combination of the screenplay and other factors mentioned in the 'pros' section make this movie impressive."
" D 16 - Who is the Villain????
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,10,"Karthick Naren a young mind wrote and directed D 16. My god at this age he is making movies like these.
You can't take your eyes off from this thriller...
Definitely one of the must watch movie.
If you have watched the hindi version on YouTube then please watch the telugu version for the end 5 mins... in those 5 mins story is explained in lucid manner with a beautiful song running in the background.... so who is the Villain????"
" Short and Perfect.
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie is an Ideal for Thriller genre.
Writing , acting and direction at its best.In a nutshell - You can't miss this."
" Carries the entire Kollywood industry on it's back
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,10,"This movie is an excellent thriller with perfectly executed plot twists that will keep you on your toes. Rahman's excellent acting is chef's kiss, the cherry on top.Excellent story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Newcomers did a good job.This movie is much, MUCH better than 90% of the tamil movies coming out today (no bar scenes/love failure/cliche stalker hero) - a very fresh change that tamil cinema needs to embrace more, instead of having stupid wine shop scenes.If you liked this, you will love Vikram Vedha, Ratchasan, Theeran Adhigaram Ondru, and Kaithi."
" Unpredictable story with cool acting
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,8,"You'll not get full of thrilling experience watching this movie. But It's variety and unpredictable story will push to watch till the end. A laudable film plays with your emotion. But this movie doesn't.
But the filmography is beautiful to watch. It soothes your eyes."
" A thriller with pure Indianness
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,10,"You may ask why Indianness is important and relevant to rate the movie. The reason, this movie did not loose a bit of thrill even if it depicts Indian values. It waved by not adding Bollywood style masala. Also a suspense thriller is great when it keeps you making guesses even till the last scene of the movie. Surely this movie does that. Really one of the best South Indian suspense thriller."
" Victim blaming at its best
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,1,It's just one dialogue in the end which blames the victim in the end. But that's enough. Also ending doesn't make much sense.
" A must watch crime thriller
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,10,Most underrated movie in tamil. I never knew a movie named dhuruvangal pathinaru existed. I came across this movie after a friend of mine suggested. I regret watching this movie after 4 years. I wish I knew this before. The cast of the movie is not popular which is the only reason why many of them never knew. Raatchasan and D16 are the 2 best movies with full of suspense and thrill. Rahman plays the lead role as a cop. Climax of the movie is bomb!!! The second half of the movie is the best with making you sit on the top of the seat. The interesting fact is that the director was a 21 year old man when the movie released. It's time we appreciate the young talent
" Not worth the hype!!
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,5,So after year's of hearing about this movie finally gave it a watch...very slow very draggy ..inspired by many hollywood movies ..more then half the film the screen is in shadows and black can't see nothing. A youtube short film made as a feature film but i gave it 5 stars for the twist in the climax.
" Exceptional
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,9,"This is one of the best thriller movie that I have ever seen.
It has a best way of storytelling.
Karthick naren has set an example for the other Indian film industry.
Bollywood has not produced such a nail biting thriller in the recent times.Acting 9/10
Direction 10/10
Editing 9/10
Story 8/10
and the best part
Climax 10/10Overall a must watch for the Thrill lovers."
" Wow!!
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,8,"1. Excellent story
2. Crisp screenplayYou cannot take your eyes off from the screen for a second.
This is really a well written suspense thriller
Congratulations to the writing team mainly"
" A complete duality!!
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,3,The trailer and the movie was fully different part of view.In the trailer there seemed to be a psypath killer.But the whole movie never intended to show us any kind of psychological matter.If i consider this it can be average movie.But after this duality i can't give this movie even 5/10.
" Average thriller
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,5,I don't understand the hype! This is not a bad film but not wow as well. I felt that it pushed too hard to be different. New faces were fresh and nice to see on the screen. But overall it is an average thriller to watch on TV on a boring Sunday.
" Tooo mysterious
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,9,"It's unbelievable this film was directed by debut director from tamil ,sry not only tamil but from cinema industry it's wonderful movie I have ever seen in Mastery and Thriller category"
" Was that a wrong ending for a beautiful movie??
",2019-09-18 00:00:00,1,"What was the need to kill Deepak?
He could do better by asking for a detailed dept. enquiry against Deepak. He was not gonna get a medal if the crime was solved . But Deepak covered a girls' sad life..
He reacted like Deepak purposefully created an accident to help his brother ..
There is a saying ""Ask no questions in a story""
So I assume the story writer to be a odd guy.. Because he determines how the story must be..
10 stars for every effort to make this cinema come true except for the story. So only one star"

" Overrated nonsense movie
",2019-08-17 00:00:00,1,I don't know why such high rating for this nonsense movie. Director just fooled people. So many hole in the plot. Can't digest the story. So many why's there in the movie.
" USELESS LABYRINTH
",2019-08-15 00:00:00,5,"F you can understand the convoluted story which even in closing seems to have lost half its own clues, good luck to you."
" Good thriller, but could have been better with a better climax.
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,7,"While I was not transfixed, the element of mystery was buoyed to the very end in this movie; however, the climactic effect was reduced by a not so spectacular climax.However, the elements of a good thriller are there. You are led to believe in a chase, in the chase of something or someone specific when there wasn't really a chase to begin with.Furthermore, the lack of melodrama and a pernicious romantic element only served to accentuate the tension which starts building up from the very start.In this manner, this movie is truly about how one part leads to another, and another to many others. There is an unfurling which occurs. It is a pointillist painting where you see the dots but are not able to connect the whole plot until much later in the movie.However, the evolving complexity of this enigma gets muddled a bit by a climax which feels rushed, and not in coherence with the entire convoluting enigma being built in the movie.The actors were good, and each character felt in place in this chessboard, even if Rahmaan who plays the main character occupied a large but weighty presence throughout the movie. While Rahmaan acts as a narrator in this movie, I also feel like he was overexposed to the point of saturation. The other characters left a poignant mark, but their importance in the plot is somewhat eclipsed by their minute presence.In another manner, it could also be said that their momentaneous presence kept the audience at bay, and probably a little bit away from suspicion, in which case, I have to admit, matches the ending of this movie.Then, the mood, tone and visuals in this movie fused well with the heavy tension being built up. It was evenly grim throughout and the sound score was neat, playing well in augmenting the suspense.This movie is a short watch, but I don't think it's going to be something I would watch again, albeit it did not felt like time lost."
" Must Watch
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,9,"A loud applause to Karthick Naren for giving such a fantastic thrilling
tamil movie. The screenplay was brilliant and the suspense was hold till the last scene of the movie. Rahman's performance as a cop was excellent."
" Oh man! What a Movie!!
",2019-05-23 00:00:00,10,One of the Best in Tamil cinema. Good acting Rahman sir. Awesome sound mix in the movie. Good film by young director Karthik Naren. Worth the money to watch this brilliant MasterPiece!!
" Best Thriller in Recent Times
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,10,One of the best thriller in recent years. Rahman did his roll very well. Each and every dialogues are well executed. Class acting. Class direction.
" Good but overrated
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,6,"The movie itself is indeed very good. It was pacey and packed with good performances however the debutant director who did an excellent job could not hide the plot holes and a cliche of a climax.One thing I did not understand at all is, why the Trailer of the movie is 'totally' different from the movie itself. I mean totally different story lines. That does not make any sense."

I watched it on YouTube with subtitles and yet i found it amazing. I seriously recommend this movie to those who loves films like PRISONERS, THE USUAL SUSPECT, CHANGELING,ZODIAC etc who loves suspense and thriller movies..."

" A thriller with not much thrill
",2018-05-24 00:00:00,7,"Movie starts off well, but meanders away after half stage. It would have been better if the movie was not a recall."
" Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru (2016)
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,10,The movie was superb. Rahman acted very good in the movie. The movie was so interesting and thrilling. Everyone acted very well in the movie. BGM in the movie was also good.
" Intriguing, suspenseful and excellently consistent thriller
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,8,"Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru is an unexpected but solid debut from Karthik Naren. The premise is a basic whodunit, surrounding a supposed suicide, a mysterious hit and run accident and a woman's disappearance. Although it is a very basic concept, Karthik Naren has written a very unique screenplay for this film that works excellently especially with a second viewing. Its pretty much hard to fail with a whodunit at least in the first half or so of a film. Even though countless films use it, there is always the base suspense element which the premise provides by default, so even if all else goes wrong, this default ""whodunit"" suspense is there to compensate. However this is nowhere near a cliched thriller as Karthik Naren does much more than that, by creating a realistic and grounded world bolstered by a non-linear screenplay very much akin to that of pulp fiction and City of God.We see different incidents and occurences from different narrative view points and perspectives, which flawlessly intertwine and fit together like jigsaw pieces to provide a wholesome view at the end of the film. Perspective is a very important theme in this film. The very first scene will seem cliched; A masked ""psycho killer"" walks into a house and seemingly murders a couple. But when contrasted at the end of the film when the true events are shown, and near the middle when we see Deepak's theory, it all makes sense. Furthermore insert a dialogue when a character tells Deepak ""don't think like a typical police officer"". The speciality of this film is Karthik Naren's subtle subtext. We see the whole film through Deepak's perspective of other people's perspectives: A chinese box narrative. A twist at the end of the film gives this idea much more prominence and also provides the film with its emotional crux (There is a flaw with this that I will come back to in the end).Another think that I love about this film is its consistent tone. It stays true to itself. The director has married himself to a thriller and he stays faithful to the wife of his chosen genre throughout the film. There isnt a random affair with a romantic track or a night fling with a comedy narrative. This is true even in its use of violence; What is present is minimal and realistic.There is almost no onscreen violence in terms of fight or action sequences...and in that sense this film is unique as it creates intensity without using violence. What makes it unique is that it is a combination between Nolan (its play on perspective) and Hitchcock (the constant maintenance of suspense).Karthik's attention to detail is also mostly good. ""Mostly"" because there are a couple of scenes where attention to detail would have enhanced this film further. For example, it rains during the night of the crime. However, the next day morning everything is completely dry. Apart from this, in terms of the plot, all the details are important and have relevance in furthering the plot. But even nuances that aren't important for the plot enhance the film by grounding it in reality. Take the scene where Rahman walks in and out of the police station, there are many conversations taking place in the background that create the atmosphere of a police station well. Or even take the eager film students participating in a short film competition, where one of the students is lazy and is unresponsive to a phone call.All the characters used in this film are relevant to progress the plot. And they all have small characteristics that stand out and make them unique. Rahman's performance as a guilt-ridden, flawed and haunted police officer is very subtle, nuanced and yet effective in a classic Rahmanesque way. He is probably the most three dimensional character in this film, as the dilemma he faces is a very human one and one that most humans are fallible to. However, in a crucial twist at the end of the film we are required to emote with a particular character which one can definitely emote with, but the intensity and power of the twist would have been higher if this particular character had been developed to the extent Rahman was. Overall, this film was a solid debut, with a unique narrative, very well executed twists and a thriller with a refreshingly consistent tone of mystery and suspense."
" 16 extreme - crime thriller
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,10,"Movie having different elements in it,awesome screenplay,unexpected turnovers all over the movie.
best crime-thriller in film industry.
good little message at end
'' every detail counts """
" Best Tamil thriller crime movie!
",2017-12-14 00:00:00,9,"Rahman was my evergreen favorite actor. In this movie i really enjoyed his acting and also the story line was so perfect, kept me in suspense and thrilled all the time. A must watch movie!"
" Thriller for sure
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,10,"It is one of the rare type of movies in tamil cinema, because most of the tamil movies move with same love scenes and songs, even if hero and heroine are poor (in movie), songs are shooted in foreign with neat modern dresses but in actual movie scene its different, now come to point, you think like that, with small suspense and same love scenes, songs this movie get a badge as ""Thrller movie"" ? then you're wrong. This movie is totally different, actual word is superb(still not able to find exact word thats why used actual)..and final word, Climax is amazing twist."
" Overrated but interesting .....
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,6,"The 8.8 rating on IMDb is a bit too high for this film. It should be a 6 or 7 at the most. But then we Indians tend to overrate our films on IMDb - just look at the ratings for Baahubali.Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru was absorbing. In fact, it is one of the better Indian movies that I've watched in recent times. The plot might be preposterous. But the director kept it all very interesting with many twists and turns. The film was suspenseful until the every end. Usually I would stop watching Indian thrillers because they would be too over the top and inane. But with Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru, I wanted to know how the mystery would get solved. The big reveal was worth the wait. I had a tough time remembering all the twists and details. The deliberate misdirection or distraction of the viewer with the appearance of the costumed killer in the first scene was a very nice touch.But the casting of Rahman as the main character was surprising. He was too stiff and did not make much of an impact. Neither Rahman nor anyone from the supporting cast made much of an impression on me. But Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru is a decent debut for Karthick Naren. No question about it."
" One of the best Tamil Thriller in recent memory
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,9,"As a huge fan. critique and well wisher of tamil cinema, I have been contentiously disappointed with bad films . As I was just about to lose hope, this gem came up and restored my faith in Tamil cinema. This film is AMAZING. It is a work of genius. It is, by far, one of the best tamil film I have seen in recent years. This film might not be everyone's cup of tea but it is certainly my type of film. It is a crime thriller that moves steadily with the story slowly, but surely, untangling itself as the film goes on. The actors and the technical team do a great job at portraying believable characters. The dialogues are good and the cinematography is well done. The star of the film is the director. At a young age of 21, he has achieved what many experienced Indian directors still cannot and that is creating a top-quality cinema. The screenplay is also excellent. Overall. This film is a must see and has raised the bar for upcoming tamil films and I, personally, do not see this bar being raised by other films any time soon."
" Unlimited twists and turns with well kept suspense.
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,9,"Those who were complaining about mainstream films, particularly the non-Indians, the recent time has been in their favour. It was some time since the change has begun, but now the gaps between mainstream and parallel cinema is narrowing. The good news is it's not just Kollywood, but every Indian film industry taking this stride remarkably. Since I'm very attached to Tamil films, my observation says the quality of those film contents were comparable with international standards. Why I'm saying that with confidence is there's a chance this film would be remade elsewhere around the globe.So now you might be curious about this film. It is not a brain teaser. It is simply a mystery, but the developments, especially the film characters never stop till the final. Like the title says, up to 16, the new characters keep coming not giving any space for you to breath. So predicting anything makes so hard. All along the twist and turns, including a couple of them were clichéd which were needed for a screenplay like this, particularly to divert the viewer's attention from foreseeing upcoming scenes. In a similar, I thought I found a big flaw, but after some time moving ahead further I realised I got it all wrong.A middle aged man who recently retired from the police service after an incident that led him to lose one of his legs, recalls a series of events of his final days on the duty with a guest aspiring IPS officer. So going 5 years back when a double murder in the same residential area took place, the investigation kick-starts with bringing-in three suspected youngsters. But later, from different angle of the same incident adds more complication. After joining all the pieces together still they only get different theories, but not truth. That final piece in the puzzle revealed only in the last minute, which deciphered in a style.❝Karma is a boomerang. However far you may hurl it... It will bounce back to us.❞Once you watch finishing it, you will come to know it was a straight story, but turned into a nonlinear narration. Especially the different characters coming into the frame at different stages of the narration are the most cleverest part. It's good to recall everything you saw to make sure you understood the film. Some people watch such film twice and it is surely not a bad idea. But like I said, it is not a briantwister if you focused enough since the beginning. This is one of the shortest Indian films, so the pace was super fast to cover every detail.The entire film was a flashback. That's the main reason to give preference to only the most needed parts. But from the audience perspective, the story they learn can be viewed from any angle for a different result. I mean, some of us usually choose sides if there's a rivalry in the tale. In this film it was a guessing game surrounding the deaths. Except a very few characters, no one stays for very long which only fuels the mystery further.The best part is there's no lie, like any film character committing one to escape the law. The narration only avoids the full detail which is what makes us tough to crack the nut. Those given false statements never see the light on the progression, which is a big hint you if you are watching it for the first time to stay on the right course to possibly come close to the truth before the film reveals itself. It's the writing and the direction that makes this film great. From Hollywood to French, Korean, we often see good script like this, but in the execution where most of them fails. From the casting and performances to the locations, technical side of the film, even turning it into a good quality product with such budget was remarkably done.This is the director's feature film debut and it is a loud statement of his arrival. Mainstream commercial cinema is a trap with big stars, so I hope he stays in the parallel cinema. Coming back to the film, it is a must see for neo-mystery-thriller fans. One of the best films for non-Indians to try if they haven't seen any Indian films. But anyway, I strongly suggest it to everyone.9/10"
" An engaging thriller without the usual tricks !
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,10,"From the moment it begins, it gets you hooked to the event. It makes us construct the scenes leading up to the ""event"" based on the information we receive as audience.That is what a thriller is supposed to do!Great job! Looking forward to future movies from Karthik Naren. Very impressed"
" ""A Brilliantly Crafted Crime Thriller ""
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,9,"The most tricky genre to present a flawless narrative is without doubt the thriller genre,where 21 year old debutant writer-director Karthik Naren struck it big,the foremost reason why Dhruvangal Pathinaaru is the most celebrated tamil movie in quiet a long time.The dexterity that Karthik showcased in handling the investigative part,the way the mystery was worked out and how he utilized the technical support on his disposal to the fullest is commendable and a noteworthy lesson for budding filmmakers who are struggling to make a mark on the movie industry.There wasn't a single scene that could be counted unwanted or a single point in the narrative where Karthik lost his grip and he could succeed in keeping me engaged to the investigation right from the very first scene till the end credits appeared on the screen.Surprise package of the movie was Rashin Rahman who stunned me with one of his all-time best performance,a terrific comeback of sorts and a much needed break for him in Kollywood,where he was a sort-out lead hero back in the 90s.The music and background score by Jakes Bejoy was in tune with the narration.D.O.P Sujith Sarang deserves a special applause for his top-notch frames that gave a neo-noir feeling to the presentation.Dhruvangal Pathinaaru has already achieved the much deserved success,being the most talked about and commercially successful Kollywood movie in recent times.Make sure you don't miss out on this must watch crime thriller !!"
" Beautiful narration technique cannot hide the plot hole
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,5,"The thing good with the movie was the narration technique. It cuts back and forth between what happened 5 years ago and what is happening now in the story. Rahman gave us a nice performance. Almost all the actors were nice. The camera was nice. It used long shots wherever necessary.Now let me come to the problem.The third act is full of plot holes. 1. Why would Krish try to rape Shruti on the day when it is her birthday? There are all chances that at least two or three people would be there to celebrate the birthday. Why couldn't he go on some other day? It was because it was her birthday that Rajeev came and Krish had to lose his life. 2. Why does Krish ask Vaishnavi to lodge a complaint saying that Shruti is missing? Why couldn't he ask her to talk with his father in private about the whole matter? Why does she lie to Deepak that she came to the apartment at dawn?Besides, the scene which is shown like a prologue does not happen at all. That was a very cheap attempt to make us feel like it is a very big twist that we are watching in the third act. All in all, the third act spoils the whole movie."
" Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru is the best proof for Young Indian Film Maker's talent and their technical brilliance.A perfect investigative murder mystery after a long time.
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,9,"Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru (2016): This movie garnered lot of recognition when it was known that a 21 year old Eng.drop out directed this one of the best mystery thrillers of Indian Cinema.Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru is a clever investigative whodunit thriller of Kollywood which was released in December 2016.Since then I have been waiting to watch this film and at last successfully accomplished it.Plot: Retired and handicapped cop, Deepak (Rahman),discusses about his famously unsolved case of the murder to a young man who wants to join the Indian Police Service. On a seemingly dull morning six years ago, Deepak is called in to investigate a suicide of a young man that later turns out to be a case of homicide. Even as he probes this, he gets a phone call about a woman missing from her flat, where there are traces of blood. Deepak realizes that there is a strange link between these two unfortunate women.Ther seems an insidious motive in every suspect and witnesses too..Plus Points:1)Story Screenplay and Direction: Karthik Naren is a true genius who brought us an interesting investigative murder mystery as his debut.He really has all the qualities of becoming a gem of Kollywood cinema with his extraordinary skills of visualization and writing. Naren's scripting often appears muddled -- causing confusion in the mind of a viewer. A thriller or mystery cannot, after all, be such a jigsaw puzzle that solving it diminishes a fair degree of cinematic enjoyment.Naren must be commended for his highly focused way of narration. No distractions here.2)Cinematography: Cinematographer Sujith Sarang has maintained this cinematic dark tone which built the tension to the core.Definitely deserves a nomination for awards.3)BGM: If Karthik as director is the brain of the film,cinematography and BGM are like heart and eyes of the film.They played a key role in the movie's suspense building.4)Performances: All the actors who are mostly new face have done a terrific job with natural performances.Rahman as Deepak is very good and perfectly gave his best output.So,Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru is the best proof for Young Indian Film Maker's talent and their technical brilliance.A perfect investigative murder mystery after a long time.My rating 8.5/10"
" Thrilled; Entertained - Over Satisfied - Worth every penny
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,10,"When one particular name of a movie keeps rounding your ears amongst movie-buff circle, anyone would be rather intrigued to go for it. That is how I set to watch D16. A movie with no anticipation, zero expectation, just to experience the cinema and get entertained.Movie starts with a crime scene and sets to move forward a few years where the flashback of investigation is told. The exaggeration about the crime, the mystery throughout the investigation and the search for clues - all these factors adds up to keep you in edge of your seat peeking on tip of your toes.Plot is rather simple, but the narration in a police's point of view is top notch. You can't help but think about the crime scene and investigate along with the movie. That's how beautiful the narration is.Karthik Naren has announced his arrival to Kollywood with an astonishing debut. The story and screenplay were nothing less to perfect. Dialogues were so mature for such a young director.BGM beautifully synced with the rugged tone of the movie. Glad that there wasn't any song to ruin the flow.As the name suggests, there are 16 characters in the film. But there are two outstanding characters in the name of Rahman and the Constable who assists Rahman. Rest all of them have done their part in upwards direction.This movie is a perfect treat for all people. It gets you to investigate, think and keeps you active and entertained in all means. Its a rare genius."
" Over-rated is the word
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,7,"Heard a lot about this movie. Did not live up to the hype.Pros: *Karthick Naren's direction is top class for a debutante *The ambiance of the movie is good till the last 20 minutesCons: *Underwhelming story-line with many plot holes, easy to miss with the melee of threads in the movie *A lot of convenient strokes of luck strewn throughout the movie - the ambiance of the moving being the saving grace in making the deductions look extra-ordinary when they are anything but that *The last 20 minutes are clichéd to the core, with the director taking the easy way out to finish the movie. Verdict : Over-rated is the word."

" A solid thriller
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,8,"Heavily recommended to me as one of the finest investigative thrillers in modern Tamil Cinema, I chose a distraction-free weekend to watch this movie with full attention. I was told that I would not be able to follow the storyline if I missed a single scene, so I was all the more excited. The movie started smoothly enough with enough to keep us hooked in the first few minutes itself. It boasts of crisp well paced dialogues and generous plot twists but not too many to the point of confusion. Loved to hear Rahman's self dubbed dialogues, tinged with a bit of Malayalam accent but confident and charming enough. We can find new faces throughout but with clearly defined characterisations of each. Ashwin Kumar, who had given an impressive negative performance in the Malayalam movie Jacobinte Swargarajyam, proves his mettle here too.The development of the plot doesn't talk much about the investigative skills of Rahman but makes it more natural and plausible. We do keep guessing the killer after an hour into the movie but it was refreshing to not see a clichéd ending. A couple of unanswered questions are on the tip of the tongue once the movie is over but we can assume and close the loose endsNew music director Jakes Bejoy has given a supportive bgm track and commendable finishing song. Kudos to the Karthik Naren, who has ventured bravely into the cine field at such a young age and made his mark here on his maiden attempt itself."
" wow wow wow
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,9,"This movie is my favourite movie of 2016. A movie like this took a bloody long time to come. Karthick Naren thank you. In a masala filled industry with cliché dialogues and overrated action sequences,this movie definitely stands out. The movie puts you in the edge of your seat from the very beginning. The movie captures every details so delicately. The plot is decent but the way it is dealt with is what makes the movie so thrilling. Rahman did a great job to keep us thinking till the end. This movie should have been dubbed and released in multiple languages. The twist was like icing on a black forest cake. Best 1hr 44 min of my life. This is a must watch. DO NOT MISS IT"
" Top movie
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,10,"I would say this is one of the best film in recent times.Specially Mr. Rahman (the old evergreen romantic Malayalam's superstar), he is a class act in this movie.Big congrats to Rahman Sir and Director for immense performance and commitment shown towards this movie.All other actors did their part too...Screenplay is awesome. Requesting distributors to treat this kind of movies in top category.Must watch movie."
" Perfect mystery, thriller in Tamil
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,9,"One of the best mystery thriller in Tamil movies. especially small small details that director carried out is excellent. Dialogues are so intense and meaningful. There are no irrelevant (not even one) scenes or songs. The end song with connecting the plots. wow. Well done. Kudos to Karthick Naren. A warm welcome to Tamil industry. Only flaw I could see, movie flow as they show. However, it doesn't impact anything. Worth watch."
" Forced to be Thrilled..!!
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,6,"Dhruvungal Pathinaaru is a commendable attempt at a thriller. But the director has failed to understand a critical rule of film making when it comes to thrillers, is how to misdirect the audience. Misdirection should never be forced on the audience rather it should play within the movie.Addition of an entire scene at the start of the movie in the end to reveal that it was only a figment of one of the characters imagination is literally trying to fool the audience, not misdirect and one of my major concerns with the movie.The other major concern is the use of the word psycho killer as throwing this word around through out the movie creates an expectation toward the spectacular and when the proceedings fall flat instead, effects the entire perception of the movie.Finally, the psycho killer theory is something that is shared only between Deepak and Gautham and this is never made public as the media reports it to be a case of a stalker, killing his victim. Meaning the point at the start of the movie where the visitor asks him about the psycho killer case, it is evident that this is indeed Gautham and the movie could have ended at that point and not dragged on for another hour to the big reveal.Rahman's is the only performance that seems to have mattered to the director so that ends up as the only watchable performance in the movie as the rest are just added to fill the space around Rahman and help the director's attempt to thrill us.In the end D16 is a good attempt at trying to make a thriller but a normal story, forced twists, slow pace make it a hit and miss attempt at a thriller. The high rating is misleading and i believe it is owing to the underdog status given to the movie."
" A brilliant thriller made after a long time in Tamil cinema! A master class !!!
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,9,"FINALLY !!! A KIND OF FILM I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WAITING FOR IN TAMIL CINEMA ! Truly a mind-twisting movie experience! A dark-thriller! Indeed one of the best dark thrillers in Tamil cinema! The sound mixing and background for this movie is so brilliant. Truly a a genius! Karthick Naren an young director in his early 20s delivers one of the best thrillers made in Tamil cinema. Although you might have no idea where the film is taking you to, no worries, the climax of the movie will leave you in shock. Rahaman the actor of this film totally pulled it off with ease. Its sad to see that not many people can appreciate this master piece, more films like this should come out. Support this kind of films and don't let Tamil cinema rot in the name of masala films. Top notch thriller which you will not regret watching. Its worth every penny of your money! Go watch it! My score - 9.2/10"
" Karma is a boomerang, however you furl it, bounces back to you
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,10,"The summary tells the whole story, the movie is very gripping, you have to be very attentive to catch every minute detail right from start the movie is well made, following points have caught my attention1. Masked killer (Makes you want to know who is inside), great introduction2. Rahman rubbing the eyes, which is shown as graphic in introduction. 3. Character of gautham is well made. 4. Up to the climax the killer is given great importance, but the real motive behind the story is ordinary and that intricate details are also well woven in between the plot to minute detail. 5. Ultimately our protagonist falls victim to a fate which he knows far later, but cant much help.I cant believe a debutant director has made this movie. Tamil cinema has gone to a new level, i would rate this movie above Thani Oruvan and 24.Surprising twist till last frame.One of the excellent role portrayed by RahmanDirector karthick Naren is one to be taken very seriously"
" Just a different screen
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,6,"I encourage naren took a Nice Movie. But Politics involved here.Raam sithiram pesuthadi and Anjadhe are great movies than this movie.Actor Rahman is brother in law to to A.R. so A.R promote this and mani ratnam is very close to A.R rahman. So he also promote this. And many director wishes them and say aaha, ooho. Why..Do not include politics in the movie review Please. Do encourage movies that are really Nice. I'm not Individual audience any such director. I'm a common man.Not such a great movie is this. Given rating is too high.. My rating is 6.5."
" good but not great !
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,6,"The movie is watchable. The story is clear with less characters and a soothing environment. The plot is good but there are lots of mistakes in the way the incidents happen. A lot of questions can be asked about the sequence the incidents are depicted. The story is like writing a answer and preparing a question for the answer. Detective stories are like that but here it is very direct.Rape scene is the highlight of the movie as it has enhanced the movie in several ways,it gives a big emotional dimension to the movie,if the scene was replaced by something else like murder for money etc the movie will not get the same response .My verdict is overall it is good but not perfect or something to be referred to."
" Slow Narration with Brilliant story line!!
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,7,"Reality by par, I would sense the story from start that what was it about and the narration which is well handled until the last minute.Thriller treat for anyone who likes to get engaged with crime investigation.The most liked dialogue after for anyone would be ""Karma is BITCH"" . There will be lot of expectations from Karthick Naren who had got a lot of fame from his first flick. At least , I would !!On the other side,Screenplay goes slow at time and could have been with more twists in first half.""There it still shows the inexperience in real direction"" reviewed by one of well known directors. After Mumbai police, Rahman is treat to watch.Overall , A awesome movie with great talent show in script writing.Could have been better on direction and screenplay."
" Must watch thriller
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,8,Very good attempt by the upcoming director Karthik. Right from the first scene movie is engaging.Rahman as a police officer has done a great job. No heroism just class. Unusual crime thriller which we don't get to see much in Indian / Tamil cinema. Loved the reference to Mario game of 90s and the magic brick dialogue. Rahman does have a faint Malayalam Accent during the voice over rendering. Very good editing and cinematography. Conclusion in climax doesn't leave much Questions in mind and covers almost all left over bits. All actors have done justice to their roles. I would recommend all to watch this movie as it would be one of the must watch thrillers in tamil history
" Excellent Film
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,10,"Looking at the box office this film collected is just completely sad. All the berserk Vijay and Ajith fans just go for their movies just because they are popular. Out of the many kollywood movies Bairavaa was the least realistic and one of the out-of-logic films. It has collected more than 110 Crores. Even though Karthick Naren is a young director, he has produced a great film. This is a must watch for everyone. I am very happy to see that Kollywood has entered the mindset where the plot and acting matters more than the actor. D16 has produced a very good ending, sad yet satisfying.Overall, this movie needs to be a blockbuster hit."
" Gripping Thriller
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,9,"This one is not a Mass Masala, No Heroine or body moves to entertain, No soothing songs, It won't tickle your funny bones either. When did you last watched a Tamil Gripping Crime Thriller. Running barely for 2 hours.This one will make you mad asking the questions to yourself for 1.5 hours whodunit? A hit and run or hit and hide in hood, An suicide turned out to be homicide, a women missing all weaved to a amazing plot and visually engaging feast by Karthik Naren.All new Faces Except understated Rahman and Delhi ganesh done their part Well. I found myself enthralled with the dialogue at the end of the movie 'Maybe if I had narrated my story from Gautham's point of view...I would have been the villain'. A Reality is nothing. It is all Point of views."
" Gripping
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,8,"Lovely murder mystery. Nice to see a movie with suspense being the theme with perfect pacing, enough eye for details, solidly enacted, no distractions of songs etc. Pretty much whatever makes a good solid yarn of a suspense from the good old school is in here. Two deaths, missing woman, disappearing witness and a Cop led by his assorted bag of assistants, including a new recruit in the hunt. I loved the way the story dealt in small details, especially at the police station, the new cops, the stress around their work etc. Rehman plays his part well.Definitely worth a watch."

",2017-02-03 00:00:00,9,Kudos to the entire team for this wonderful story with neat screenplay without any loopholes.That suspense till final frame of the cinema is the biggest plus of this movie.This kind of creator is much needed for Tamil industry.Producers should come forward for this kind of story;Hope this film will bag many awards this year.All the very best to director and congrats for matured acting from Rahman.D16- best thriller movie with amazing work from all departments of Cinema.
" Easily makes to my top 5 thrillers list
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,10,"It has all the ingredients of a perfect murder mysteries. Right from the keeping the viewers engaged through multiple perspectives of how the murder could have happened to increasing the pace and twists till the climax, it is screen play at its best.To choose new faces and to go without songs, i think the director deserves a special mention. This movie is an experience you will love. You will feel that you are a part of the investigation and that is where the director scores.You know a movie is brilliant if the entire audience applauds when the credits starts rolling. Kudos to the entire team to have scripted such a price of work. 10/10"
" One of the best thrillers in recent times in Kollywood.
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,8,"D-16, one of the best thrillers in the recent times. Directed by the debutant Karthick Naren. Debutant? Yes, one would wonder how this is possible by a debutant. Karthick directing his first movie has done an exceptional job.The first crime scene might seem average, but there on it's entirely a different movie. Each and every scene is planned to perfection and keeps the audience engaged till the end. Suspense is what Karthick masters, he keeps everyone guessing till it is unraveled.Rahman as Deepak has justified his role. His Malayalam dipped slang might seem a bit unfit but it doesn't over shadow his acting. The story was narrated from Rahman's point of view. Almost all the other faces are new. Everyone has done an exceptional job.Characterization was another plus no unwanted or annoying characters. Every character has contributed something to the plot. The background score by Jakes Bejoy has travelled along the movie that plants each and every scene in mind. Cinematography is another technical aspect that lifts the movie. Sujith Sarang with the camera has to be lauded for his efforts.It's a nail biter one might find travelling along the story till the very end. Karthick is another find for Kollywood. When we leave the movie halls we might still feel suspense circling our heads (Few twists have been left to be judged by the audience)."
" A murder mystery with a simple plot in an unpredictable narration
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"Written and Directed by debut Karthick Narain. With his 2 short films experience, stepped into feature film by taking a crime thriller as plot. A crime case investigation by a police officer and the way he get into the target along with multiple views from different persons involved is D16.A complete investigative mystery thriller generation where it start the ride from the very beginning without spending much on any ordinary stuffs. Success of a engaging investigation lies on the clue which come across for the next chain of scenes, even a dialogue from the movie says this as few clues of what we intend to know will come to us on its own. When we think of from where to start next, there comes a scene to give the route.Rahman, who do only limited unique character back in for the role where he perfectly fit in and his subtle acting apt for the investigation. Other cast, though they travel throughout, they neatly perform what they expected from them. As there is no songs in this movie, BGM plays the high scope for music director and it truly justified in the movie with right tone. Camera and lighting are well managed as most of the scenes happens at night where the subject shine in dark. Length of the movie is another plus where cuts are rightly placed and the engagement didn't take any downside till end. For a debutant director, the efforts and smartness spent on writing is truly evident while watching this mystery. Experimental in terms of multiple views of the crime scene and intelligent enough when the knot unfolds which gives a different view."
" An Interesting Dark thriller
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"Here goes my first review, I am not a critic but a cinephile. As a cinephile i thought of writing a review for this movie. When was the last time we were experienced a unpredictable ending in tamil movie? But I can say that now this movie has lived and satisfied large number of tamil movie watchers.The Movie. Well No spoilers ahead. I want all of you to watch the movie in theatres!!!! D-16 is tick tock dark thriller that keeps you edge of the seat. An aspiring young director says ""life is so unpredictable"" so can this film, I highly recommend this. Makes you think, feel and debate. That's the sign of quality filmmaker.Apart from performance all credits goes to director. And last credits go to composer and cinematographer. Hats off to them. Great work."
