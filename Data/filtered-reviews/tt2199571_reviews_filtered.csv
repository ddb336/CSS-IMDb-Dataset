" Claudio Castagnoli.
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,4,The producers on this is movie are stupid. Because they could have cast Claudio Castagnoli as Michael and they passed for Joel Kinnaman. If they would have cast Claudio Castagnoli as Michael in this movie they would have mad this movie into a cult classic.
" Entertaining
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,7,"Good action movie. Good acting from Neeson and Kinnaman. Nice to see a dady trying to repair the relation to his Son, and willing to take the punishment to protect him. Harris do a nice roll to."
" Action packed
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,10,"Liam Neeson's underated movie
Best performance played my all the actors
Truly Amazing Liam Neeson."
" Action, fighting, family drama, what more could you ask for?
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,8,"An old family feud resurfaces when 2 crime patriarchs find themselves on opposite sides of the death of one of their sons. The story is set up in a believable way. The characters that you are supposed to like are likable. The ones you are not supposed to root for are not likable. The dialogue is believable, if slightly cheesy at times. The ""I'll never forgive my father"" routine is a nice touch. The reluctant ""I'll do anything to save my kid"" is a very theme throughout.
The action is good. The fighting is good. I'll definitely see this again. It ranks among the better of Neeson's yearly action movies. I'd recommend it."
" Another Neeson cliche
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,5,"I think it's high time that Neeson does something completely different and unexpected. Well executed and great action, but more of the same yet again."
" Classic Old Man Neeson
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,8,"Run All Night is a great action movie set to the backdrop of a dark night in New York. This is the third of four team ups between Neeson and director Jaume Collet Serra, which includes 'Unknown', 'Non-Stop' and 'The Commuter'. Run All Night is arguably the best of the four.The premise of the movie follows Mike, played by Joel Kinnaman, a limousine driver who witnesses a murder who then goes on the run aided by his estranged father, a washed up and life weary former mob hitman.This movie is very much one of those 'is what it says on the tin' types with very little to surprise you, but what you have is exceptionally well done. The characters feel very well written and fleshed out, you can feel the history that preceded the movie and it supports the story well. The casting is top notch, the leads are excellent particularly Kinnaman, but the movie well complemented by characters played by Common and Vincent D'Onofrio.One thing that did catch my eye was way the film, particularly in the first half, transitioned from areas of New York. The camera would zoom up into the sky and then fly across the city and drop down on a different character in the new location. Reminded me of the video game GTA V.All in the all a very entertaining movie, well acted with decent pacing and great action."
" Great action movie
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,8,"If you're looking for a good action movie and enjoy Liam Neeson's other action movies, look no farther. This has all the ingredients of a good action flick and will keep you entertained till the end."
" Great movie if they took out the stupid hitman
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,7,"Great story, great filming, good action scenes. However, why do the directors nearly always have to bring in some stuff, that makes the film irritating to watch? A top professional frightening hitman that can't fight, can't aim, spraying bullets left and right without conserving ammo, and the best: always have a red laser on (as he can't aim?) that makes him more than easy to spot at all times? Argh."
" Best of Liam Neeson
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,9,"Great action movie, good story, well developed characters.., movie that I could watch again and again...
This should not be under 7/10 stars..."
" Would have been 10 if there'd been any women or minorities
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,7,"Everything you want in a geri action film, EVEN HAS A PLOT! SERIOUSLY! And you know how often you find those!One thing kept it from being a ten, none of the characters are women or minorities. It's not terrible to sit through with your boyfriend, as I said it has a for real plot. But having someone to identify with would have helped.Great movie otherwise"
" Taken 4...???
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,4,"Liam Neeson is playing exactly the same clichè role as any of the Taken trilogy except this time it's his son not daughter he mercilessly protects. If you've seen any of the Taken movies, then you've pretty much already seen this. Steven Seagal movies are more believable. Bit of shame really as there is a very good cast but sadly a totally predictable ho hum movie. Time better spent reorganising your sock drawer me thinks 🤔"
" Not that impressed
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,6,"I am normally a big fan of Liam Neeson films but this one is by no means my favourite, it's all rather predictable and run of the mill. The best thing for me was the very clever camera action when it moves between scenes."
" Naaahh...this couldn't happen
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,3,"As an action film, this fills the bill except for being totally unbelievable. A man can't go from being a drunk to being a competent shooter and driver within a few hours. A guy who is drunk all the time doesn't snap out of it and just be sober by force of will.The super tough fighter who sobers up needs days to even get his mind back on track, let alone become fit enough to pick up his old tough guy competence. It couldn't happen in a few hours. Bruce Willis showed a little of how that kind of thing would play out in ""16 Blocks"". That film is closer to being believable.Harris's role is about as wrong as Neeson's. His character tells the Albanian heroin importer that he's a legitimate businessman now, but he still holds court in a West end bar with a couple of dozen hard cases hanging around to kill people at the drop of a hat. Naaahh, doesn't make sense.Boyd Holbrook has become typecast as an insufferable prick and maybe his role here kicked that typecasting off, though I haven't really kept up with his roles in chronological order.Common's role is that of a James Bond level super villain, and just spoiled the entire, already unbelievable story. He may as well have been driving Bond's Aston Martin, or flying a jet backpack.Over all, this film doesn't work, due to the terrible writing, though the acting is good. I'll bet that Neeson insisted that his character be killed so that this doesn't become another silly Taken-type series."
" A Father With A Crimial Past, His Son On the Right Path, And When A Drug Deal Goes Bad Will The Two Become Closer.

" Enterteined, almost realistc characters
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,7,"Although L Neeson is put to play almost the same rol as he does in some other movies we all saw, this time ""geriatric action hero"" doesn't have dozens of superspecial skill (almost like superpowers). All other characters also don't look coming from Krypton, which is positive, even for an action movie.
I just didn't understand why he immediately starts to mention the ""night"" when there is no reason to think in advance that the whole drama must have an outcome in just some hours."
" Neeson Is Still A Top Action Man
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,8,"Liam Neeson is back in his very well suited action character and it works again.
Neeson plays an ex hit-man for the mob who has to protect his son from the mob he worked with.
Most of movie is set through one long night of cat and mouse chases from the cops and various mobsters.
It is good. It has tension and action. Guns, fist fights and car chases are all happily included.
The story holds up well as it does twist and turn very quickly. The development of the characters sometimes missing from these films is very good too, you care about who gets hurt.
Run All Night is not your average run of the mill action thriller its much better that."
" Same old Liam Neeson but in a good way
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,8,Really good action movie with a good story. Good acting all round and really found a strong connection with the friendship and family in this film.
" Spot on
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,8,"Great film, great acting and a not over the top storyline.. Respect 👍"
" Yeah good.
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,7,"A little bit formulaic but overall this movie was enjoyable. It was just nice to watch something post 2015 that did not have any ""woke"" elements to it."
" Fantastic and Entertaining
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,9,The movie is really underrated. Liam Neeson and Ed Harris made the movie incredible
" Grrreeeeat action movie with a story!
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,8,"Good movie full of good actors and acting ;)
Very exciting and lots of good action moments!!
Joel Kinnaman, Liam Neeson and Ed Harris.. and more.., great combination!!"
" One of Neeson's best action movies. Gripping, gritty and enjoyable stuff.
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,8,"Liam neeson plays Jimmy Conlon, an aging and borderline alcoholic mob hitman who is forced to protect his son from his former boss Shawn Maguire played by the always excellent Ed Harris.
It's a satisfying blend of character drama and gritty, violent action. One of the things i really liked was nothing was overly spectacular and silly which gives the movie a more gritty and realistic feel. The action is quick, brutal and not glamorized and the dialogue feels like things real people would say during regular conversation as well, it gets annoying in movies sometimes when characters are spouting one liners like clowns.
Liam Neeson is solid as always and believable as a hard man who is passed his prime but will kill to protect his son even though he knows there's no way it's going to end happy for himself. He's either going to die or spend the rest of his life in prison but he doesn't care as long as his boy is safe.
When he lays a guy out flat with one punch with a broken nose and missing teeth you know his character is more than capable of doing it.
The story isn't really anything you haven't seen before but it's a well made movie with good performances and the action scenes are filmed in a simple no frills style with no annoying shakey cam.
Definitely a good time for fans of Neeson, Ed Harris and tough action thrillers."
" This is one of the best action-drama / thriller movies in recent times
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,10,""" Run All Night "" is a serious, hard hitting action thriller / crime drama. Liam Neeson excels as an aging hitman who still has his killer instinct in top form. The rest of the cast have also given good performances ; namely Ed Harris, the dude who plays Liam's son , his wife, and so on.The director has also given some outstanding and creative work in making this movie. I liked the camera work very much. In a lot of scenes, the camera begins with a wide shot an then takes us, the viewers, and throws us into an intense corner with the characters on screen.In some aspects, I found Liam's performance and characterization better than his role in "" Taken"". This is because his character in "" Run All Night "" is deeper, more intense, more problematic, which makes it seem more realistic. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a realistic action-drama/ thriller, as compared to fake over the top ones."
" Blood us thicker than water
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,7,"It's like 2 movies in one. Like a sprinter at the starting line, starts slow, accelerates and finishes strong. Neeson."
" Really enjoyed this movie. Great action from start to finish ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,10,"This movie tells about how a father and son whose bond is gone because his dad left him after his mom passed away, but they both are joined together in one night to stay alive. Liam Neesom (Jimmy) protects his son from getting killed. Throughout the movie it has awesome graphics. It was a really good movie I enjoyed it a lot. I would recommend to anyone to go see it."
" Still a bad ass
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,7,Still a bad ass. Still making good action movies. The new Bruce Willis
" Typical yawnfest
",2020-01-14 00:00:00,5,"The plot is so rushed, and overall boring. With the main actors in Neeson, Kinnaman and Harris I would of thought this was gonna be something special. But unfortunately the best performance came from Boyd Holbrook who only had about 12 minutes of screentime. This movie had all the making to be an EPIC action thriller. Instead it's forgotten by next weeks new straight to dvd release lmao. NEXT!"
" Terrible Characters
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,2,"Can't remember ever seeing a movie which went so far out of its way to introduce folks who were so stupid and unlikable from the beginning. Every decision made at the start of the movie by a character was so counter-intuitive that I almost stopped after five minutes. Didn't, but should have. Competent, but, why. Paid the bills, I guess, and that's enough?"
" EXCITING & ACTION PACKED INTENSE & GRITTY CRIME THRILLER
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,8,"Liam Neeson has become an excellent action hero later in his outstanding career & i loved him in the ""Taken"" films & ""A Walk Among The Tombstones"" & ""The Grey"" & ""Non-stop"" & this fantastic intense & gritty action packed crime Thriller ""Run All Night"" this is possibly his best Action Thriller work!!!This movie is an intense filled gangster film that is very claustrophobic with it's tight & stunning cinematography making New York City seem very closed in & i got vibes of ""The Warriors"" & ""Judgment Night"" two Cult Classic urban survive the night chase films, i believe this movie was created from those great films!!!
What ""Run All Night"" is about is old school gangsters & their sons getting into a very serious situation between life & death, Liam Neeson gives one of his best gritty & tough as hell performances of his action career, he plays an aging ex-hitman named Jimmy Conlon who is pulled into the dangerous situation when his son Mike Conlon played fantasticly & intense by Joel Kinnaman witnesses a murder committed by another mob boss' son & things go straight to hell quickly & basically father & son Conolan are hunted through the rain drenched streets of New York City to be killed, that's basically the plot & i won't go way into it because it's much more exciting just letting it unfold.
I gotta say how great Joel Kinnaman is here as the angry, troubled & struggling son of a well known hitman, because his performance is excellent & he totally can stand toe to toe with the veteran Liam Neeson, I'm a huge fan of Kinnaman from the excellent but underrated ""Robocop"" remake & his Awesome part of Rick Flag in the excellent ""Suicide Squad"" & his outstanding lead performance in the Brilliant & gritty Crime Thriller ""The Informer"" the guy is hands down my favourite ""New"" actor out there & his performance & holding his own with Neeson here is spectacular!!!The great veteran actor Ed Harris gives an excellent performance as the other mob boss who's psycho son committed those murders & something else went wrong leading to the city wide hunt for the Conolans, the cast is excellent as we also have rapper turned actor ""Common"" who is a deadly Assassin also on ththe hunt for the Conolan's & Boyd Hollbrook as Danny Maguire the crazy son of Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris) & there's even a small role for major veteran great actor Nick Nolte & the main Cop on the chase too is another great actor Vincent D'onofrio who is always excellent in everything!!!
I really liked the tough & strained relationship of father & son Conolan's as both Neeson & Kinnaman are both so convincing & both outstanding actors!!!""Run All Night"" is one exciting & intense edge of the seat brutal Crime Thriller with an outstanding cast & excellent performances!!!
I love the survive the night plot & the tense very claustrophobic feel to this stylish brilliantly directed Action Thriller. One of Neeson's best"
" Awesome
",2019-11-25 00:00:00,8,Cracking movie plenty of action one of liam Neeson best movies
" Feels so real, deep in emotion, top class acting
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,10,"As a movie fan and music composer, i found this movie deeply emotional, got me from the first five minutes to the end.I can not find the right words to appreciate Liam Nielsen's performance. He gave me the sense of being a father, protecting his child so deeply, i had tears in my eyes in a few scenes as a 40 year old man. Maybe it's about having my own child, losing my father several years ago but the very natural acting as a father who is willing to giving his life in an honorable way has passed to me and the audience i believe.And Ed Harris. My god.. We watched two kings in this movie. God i have to watch thos movie again and again every six months.Junkie XL.. The composer have done a wonnnderful job. He had decided the non music moments very well (believe me it's hard and important), never put the music in front of the movie, supported the movie perfectly, never overused anything. It was a very good job that he wasn't trying to put himself on the front and make his ad. Therefore i appreciate his job giving the right emotions at the right time and supporting this movie so strongly. Good job.Okan Us"
" Really Good
",2019-08-17 00:00:00,10,Was watching this with my father a few years ago and we can agree it was fantastic. I must watch in my opinion. There however is a deeper meaning to this movie and I'll let y'all figure it out.
" A different Liam Nesson action film
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,7,"This film caught my attention due to the Hell's Kitchen Irish Mob. I have always loved the severely overlooked film State Of Grace. This film feels like the VOD sequel. Though not a bad thing it doesn't fully recognize its true potential. This is another action vehicle for Neeson with some great sub plots of true events. They're are many bits of true crime trivia from The Westie's reign bloody N.Y. reign. A good film that could've been a great film if given the proper Story structure. Instead we get a good movie that hits most of the action cliches. If you enjoyed this film checkout State Of Grace, you won't be disappointed."
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,7,"Intense entertaining movie. suspenseful most of the way. good story. made me feel for the characters. awesome directing, reminded me a lot of running scared. dark tone and mood. great character development. Good acting. lots of cool visuals and cinematography. good music. and good heart. had a few small issues but nothing serious (2 viewings)"
" A very good action film!
",2019-05-30 00:00:00,10,John has to choose a life between a criminal life and his family. You must see it!
" A kind of sad film actually.
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,7,"All Night Long is a kind of a great film. It describes a father's love for a son, no matter how his child behaves. The lead actor Liam Neeson is such a great actor. I totally love his performance. Every film he's in, it becomes great one. That's why I always watch his films.The whole process is taken place in one night. I see why the film's name is All Night Long. In this film, his son is literally a bad son. Still, his father (Liam Neeson) still cares about him and solves every problem he's facing. I kind of love that kind of father and admire him. So sad that he died at the end. I wish he didn't die.All in all, All Night Long is something different from those films I've watched. But good different. I totally love this film because it shows a father's love. I would like every father watch it, so that they could do the same to their children and love them with all of their hearts."
" Neeson at his best.
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,8,"If you like neeson you can't go wrong with this, gritty and violent in all the right places"
" Only Ends One Way
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,7,"There's no airplane, train, international terrorists, or snow plows, but this Liam Neeson crime-thriller is one of great quality because of the actors involved. I mean please, Neeson vs Ed Harris? Two of my favorite actors of all time, there's no question I was going to enjoy this one. But it really is the dynamic between those two that makes the movie as good as it is. Without the weight of the history between them in this story, you don't get the same impact in the 3rd act when certain things go down. I could have actually used more backstory and flashbacks then we got. There's plenty of homages and inspirations that director Jaume Collet-Serra puts in here, like Mystic River or Heat, which are two of the greatest crime films of all time. I wouldn't say Run All Night gets to that level, but it's nonetheless a thrilling 120 minute ride. And you know, that ending was pretty sweet too.7.3/10"
" No jokes, way too sentimental sometimes and without Ed Harris and Liam Neeson this would have become a B-movie. Still an enjoyable action movie if you are not too picky.
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,6,"Humbling true to life start of the story in which a former hit man (Liam Neeson) has to play for Santa Clause to earn a few honest bucks. The only jokes are to be found at this Santa Clause impersonation start, the rest of the story is dead serious. Because his son's life gets endangered when he is a witness to a crime, Liam Neeson sheds his Santa suite and becomes a real hardhitting criminal again in order to protect his son's life. Will father and son survive the attacks on their life while they are on the run?Suspenseful and action packed middle part. But at the end this story suddenly wants to be overly sentimentally dramatic which spoils the fun of a straight shoot em up story a bit for me personally. All in all not bad for those who like these kinda action packed Liam Neeson flicks. Not bad, yet nothing special either besides the great acting performance by especially Ed Harris."
" Kinnaman
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,3,I only watched this because Joel Kinnaman is on it. That's all. No more to say about this awful action film.
" Liam Neesploitation!
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,7,"Few things in the present-day cinema business are as fascinating and remarkable as the sudden career change that Liam Neeson underwent since 2008! The charismatic Irish born actor has always been a tough guy, at least from the looks of it, but nevertheless he was mainly known and celebrated for his weighty and highbrowed roles, like in ""Schindler's List"", ""Michael Collins"" or ""Les Misérables"". But since 2008, with the release of the first ""Taken"", Neeson seems reborn as a hardcore-to-the-bone and authentically unhinged action hero! The ""Taken"" sequels, and other similarly themed and equally fast-paced action movies (like ""Unknown"", ""Non-Stop"" and ""The Grey""), followed so quickly in the next ten years that we can now even almost speak of a spontaneous new sub-genre: Liam Neesploitation! ""Run All Night"", Neeson's third collaboration with director Jaume Collet-Serra in a row, is easily his best since the original ""Taken"", and it takes our protagonist back to his roots by depicting a heavy-drinking and embittered Irish ex-gangster. What makes the film even cooler is that Neeson is now surrounded by equally embittered compeers, like the underrated Vincent D'Onofrio, the sadly forgotten Bruce McGill and the always phenomenal Ed Harris. The difference between these old & experienced veterans and an ensemble cast existing of young hunks is that you genuinely believe them if they act like they don't care if they are going to die or not! Neeson is terrific as the emotionally tormented former hit man Jimmy Conlon, with real agony in his eyes and voice. Certain circumstances force him to kill the son of his best friend and patron Shawn Maguire, and the latter now swears that he's ""coming after Jimmy's son Mike with everything he's got"". Sit back and enjoy the wild mixture of car chases, virulent shootouts and raw duels."
" a great mob movie
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you what parents will do in order to protect their children. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" A lot of worse ones about.
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,8,"This movie is well worth watching, with top stars Liam Neeson and Ed Harris turning in their usual good performances.
While it would never be in awards contention, with lots of poor gangster pics about this one has a strong enough story to hold the viewer."
" JIMMY IS COMING
",2018-09-27 00:00:00,8,"Jimmy (Liam Neeson) is an old hitman who can't sleep, seeing the faces of those that he killed. He lives his life alone smoking cigarettes and drinking scotch. His BFF and old boss is Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris) who is now an honest businessman, while his son, Danny (Boyd Holbrook) is not. Events happen in which Jimmy's estranged son Michael (Joel Kinnaman) becomes a target for Shawn.Jimmy aids his son as they ""Run All Night"" ....and part of the morning too, although that would have made an awkward title.For those of you felt taken in ""Taken 3"" Liam plays a similar character, without the electronics. It is action filled with car chases, building fires, minor roof jumping, and plenty of gun action.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,7,"Thirty years have passed, the competition is gone, the cops are off their backs, for a mob boss and his hit-man, every thing is peaceful. Until one night, when their adult children come into conflict. One commits a murder, the other is a witness, and when one of them ends up dead, the family is torn apart with one on the run and the other on his heels. It honestly took me a while to watch this movie, because I was tired of Liam Neeson and his very particular set of skills, but his character wasn't what I expected. While not having the popularity of Taken, Neeson's performance in this film, was better than any performance he's given in an action film to date. Paired with the ultimate crime boss, Ed Harris, and The Killing's Joel Kinnaman, this movie had a cast that couldn't fail. Watching this compelling story, I couldn't help but think that this would have been an amazing ending for the Sopranos. Run All Night was surprising in the way that it was done, because it wasn't your typical mafia movie, but it wasn't an action film either. The writers very cleverly combined elements of both to combine the thrilling action of a Falling Down, with the crime story of a really good Sopranos episode. The film wasn't just about the incident and the chase and that's why it was special. They even managed to get Law & Order's Vincent D'Onofrio to play the lead detective in the case, and we all know the intensity he can bring to a role. It was a slow start and a somewhat predictable ending, but in the middle, Run All Night was so good, that I could have stayed up and kept watching it all night."
" The small heat .
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,9,"Very good movie with two big actors, reminds me Heat"
" Liam Neeson is Always Cool
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,7,"This isn't a great movie but there's some good suspense, thrills and action and Liam Neeson is always great. In this he has to decide between his son, who he has problems with, and his boss and best friend, Ed Harris, who he has always been loyal to. A fun watch."
" It was much much better than "" Taken "" series
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,9,"I really do not understand why this movie did not fare well. Liam neesan,
Joel Kinnaman and Ed Harris gave one of their best performances ever.
Despite being a brutal action movie, it did have some values. Among the
four Liam Neeson - Jamue collet Serra colloboration, I would rate 
Run all Night the best. Good camera work and effective background music.
Crisp editing. Ravi Chatles."
" Seen it all before
",2018-04-12 00:00:00,7,"This movie felt very long, not that it was boring just that I've seen it all before from Liam Neeson. He plays exactly the same character here as he has since he started his badass aging action hero career. We've seen this growly, revenge man in all the Taken movies, Nonstop, Unknown. And despite the ongoing carnage he sets off here in ""one night"" in N.Y with shootouts, car chases burning buildings, stabbings, crazed hit men (Common) it all still felt kinda meh. Here Liam is a booze addled former hit man, a shell of his former self, haunted by his life of crime and laughed at or pitied by his mob boss/old friend (Ed Harris) and his cronies. When his estranged son (Joel Kinnaman) gets marked to be killed by his bosses son, Neeson is forced to turn against his employers, put down the bottle and protect his son at all costs. Some great scenes of dialogue with Liam and Harris and I enjoyed Joel Kinnaman. I also liked the story hook which sees Neeson forced to tun against his lifelong friend and and work with his son, unfortunately the running, shooting, hunting, chasing, and killing, went on and on becoming sorta mindless. Like I said, meh, ultimately forgettable."
" Fast Paced Action Thriller
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,8,This is for Liam Neeson fans. Ed harris gives a fantastic performance too. The scenes between the two veteran actors are mesmerizing. The action scenes are brilliantly shot. Joel Edgarton looks nice too. It may not make sense in many scenes since it borrows elements from movies in 80's.
" Run All Night might not have been popular amongst people, but actually this is Neeson and Collet-Serra's second best collaboration.
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,7,"The top spot goes to Unknown with Non-Stop in third position. In Run All Night, a father estranged from his son saves his life but at a consequence of provoking his oldest friend. How far will he go to protect his own blood and family? It might sound generic, and to be honest I was not entirely captivated in my original viewing. Now that I've revisited this, I can say there is something about it that stands out. Jaume Collet-Serra's direction. He turned a formulaic and predictable crime thriller into a flashy and technically fluent piece of cinema. The amount of different camera styles utilised is quite the achievement. Quick cuts for the action, long rotational takes for dialogue, freeze frames and slow motion, city traversal scenes that are sped up and the occasional POV perspectives. It's technically acute, and it is this that enhances the thriller as a whole. Then you add in Neeson, who is already a dependant rejuvenated action star, to bring in audiences. He does occasionally enter his typical ""badass"" role that he is now known for but the first act enabled him to convey a troubled and aged hitman with a tainted past. Throughout its entirety there is a gritty undertone that gets under your skin. New York City has never looked so hauntingly majestic at night yet simultaneously ever so terrifying. The supporting cast were functional, I liked Common as a professional hitman. Joel Kinnaman was mediocre as always and Ed Harris needed more screen time. Plenty of memorable scenes including a shootout in a bar, secluded woods and an intense urban car chase. All filmed excellently, with perhaps slightly too many quick cuts in the brawls. The main story is generic, however it works. The aesthetic and technical artistry overlaps the predictable plot and creates the illusory effect of freshness. I admire that. It's unfortunate this did not do well in its theatrical run, I think it will appreciated more as time goes on."
" all action
",2017-09-21 00:00:00,8,"Liam Neeson stars with Ed Harris, Joel Kinnaman, and Vincent D'Onofrio in ""Run All Night"" from 2015.Alcoholic ex-hit man Jimmy Conlon, known as Gravedigger, is estranged from his family but still in touch with his ex-boss and childhood friend, Sean Maguire (Harris). Jimmy's son Mike (Kinnaman) has a wife and two girls - he's a former boxer now working as a limo driver. One night he witnesses Sean's son Danny kill two drug dealers. Danny goes after him and manages to get him into his house, but Mike knocks him out; unfortunately he leaves his wallet behind.Jimmy arrives at his son's house, having heard about the drug deal gone wrong. Mike, of course, wants nothing to do with him. Mike goes outside for a smoke and sees Danny's car. He ultimately kills Danny. His best friend Sean then becomes his mortal enemy, determined to kill both Danny and Mike to take revenge for his son's death. Jimmy and Mike go on the run while Jimmy tries to figure out a way to bargain with either Sean or the detective (D'Onofrio) who's been after him for years so that he can protect his son and his son's family.Very exciting film, with nonstop action and also pathos as Jimmy faces the son he doesn't know and comes to terms with the end of his friendship with Sean - knowing it will result in the death of one or both of them.The acting is absolutely top-notch, with Neeson giving a wonderful performance as a sad, lonely drunk paying for his sins. The rest of the cast is fantastic and very believable.Highly recommended."
" Well thrilling Action movie
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,7,"Liam Neeson, starring in his his now standard turn of several similar action thrillers. A man with a past given a chance to redeem himself with judicious amounts of crowd-pleasing violence. Perhaps it's unfair to say the Northern Irish actor could phone in this performance from anywhere in the world, as he does it so well, but one can understand those that criticize the actor for repeating himself, with the inevitable diminishing effect at the box office.Run All Night deserves to be seen as more than just another Liam Neeson early-year actioner. It's a nasty movie with great pace and a strong spine thanks to those two prolific leads. Although it does have some flaws and may drag in between scenes, though as an action thriller it provides the necessary thrills and interest for the viewers."
" Acceptable Liam Neeson thriller
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,6,"RUN ALL NIGHT marks the third collaboration between star Liam Neeson and director Jaume Collet-Serra; their previous movies were the disappointing UNKNOWN and the above-average NON-STOP. RUN ALL NIGHT falls somewhere in the middle of those two films in terms of quality; it's a good enough mob thriller although not quite good enough to be considered a classic or indeed a regular watch. The film's very familiarity is what works against it throughout. Neeson and his adult son, played by Joel Kinnaman, are forced to go on the run from mob boss Ed Harris when things go bad, and the film follows the situation from there. It's set over a single night, which gives it some fun, but the story has been done before and done better, for example in Sam Mendes' ROAD TO PERDITION.This means you end up watching the film to enjoy the other qualities. If a thriller's plotting is unremarkable then it must have outstanding action scenes, and the action in RUN ALL NIGHT is fun although not quite spellbinding. The bit in the subway station and the attack in the burning apartment complex are both good scenes but there are too many slow bits in the middle, and the two hour running time is half an hour too long. Collet-Serra can't do a proper transition scene without some lame CGI effects of the sped-up camera flying up in the sky and across the city, which I found quite tiresome after a while.In terms of the cast, Neeson is on autopilot in this one. He looks old and tired and you wonder how much of that is really acting. Harris is suitably imposing as the antagonist of the piece, but his role is a virtual reprise of the one he played in A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. Best of the bunch is the great Kinnaman, of the EASY MONEY trilogy, but he's kept off the screen for way too long. RUN ALL NIGHT is a fine enough slice of entertainment for genre fans but it's one of those films which simply doesn't hold up if you think about it too long."
" Let's cross that line together...
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,7,"""Run all Night"" is the most recent movie from a new director i highly admire, Jaume Collet-Serra. And this movie is his third collaboration with Liam Neeson, after the two strikes ""Unknown Identity"" and ""Non-Stop"", the latter is my favourite plane-centered-action- thriller to date. (I also want to mention that he did one of my favourite psycho- horror-thrillers ""Orphan"")Even though this guy's first movie was the ""House of Wax""-Remake, which isn't that great, he managed to get his own style and voice, and i like his work very much.And this movie is no exception. It's a very well told, and intriguingly written Gangster-Revenge-Thriller, with Liam Neeson and Ed Harris as old Gangster-buddies, who try to kill each other, after Neeson killed Harris son, to protect his own.The title has a good reason to appear four times (!) in the movie, because the movie's really set during one night, and hell what a beautiful night it is. All the transition-shots to other locations, literally fly over the whole city and stop at the new location, and between moments where some time passes, there are just shots of the nightlife of the city, so you really feel the atmosphere. It reminded me of some of Michael Manns movies.The action is very well directed, intense and brutal. And the characters, get believably hurt, and never feel like they are unbeatable, like in other recent action movies. The best comparison would be ""A good day to die Hard"", where John McClane and his son have to team up to survive, but they are never in real danger, the bad guys are bland, and the action over-the-top.This movie is the fifth Die Hard i wish we'd got, plus much more drama than i expected. The movie never relies on painting the characters bad, or good and role with it, they are believable and all of them have a dark and a light side. Liam Neeson plays a guy who would be an unlikeable asshole if it wasn't for his charisma which keeps you interested in him, and his relationship to mobster- boss Ed Haris feels real and it's great when you see Neeson killing him, but when he dies in his arms, you see that they respect each other after all, and wished non of this had happened. It's great stuff, and fairly well told.Technically it's also very well made, the night scenes are a little too dark at times, but you see what's necessary, and the soundtrack by Junkie XL fits very well, and helps setting the dark tone.All in all a very enjoyable, dark and dramatic Action-Thriller which will entertain you the whole night through..."
