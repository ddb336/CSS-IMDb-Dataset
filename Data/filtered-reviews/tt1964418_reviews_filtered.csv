" A great family film!
",2021-04-06 00:00:00,10,"Sorry, I haven't review this app in the while but here's my review.A great film! To my family and I, the beginning was extremely confusing. However, we stuck with it and we ended up really enjoying it! I suggest you do the same, if you are initially puzzled. In terms of minor parts of the film, it was a little bit predictable. None of the major plot nor important features were, it was just minor things in a few scenes. There was quite a bit of swearing but it wasn't too bad. However, at the end, there is one strong word. The actors involved are all very good and overall, the film is VERY well done! There is quite a lot of violence but it is all unrealistic so is quite comedic. If you are a star wars fan, I highly suggest this film! Although it is nothing to do with Star Wars, in a few of the scenes there are some references that are fun to spot. It promotes dreaming and optimism. Two very good messages! The film also surrounds the topic of saving the world and the problems at the moment - A very relevant subject!In conclusion, I think this film is something that should be on your watchlist!"
" Only positivity? Retro Sci-Fi? No it predicted Fridays for Future
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,10,"This movie has ideas for 5 full movies. And yes it needs this, because that's about it, ideas of another future. It's not only about thinking positive and than everything changes, it is about to start DOING something.It is not a ""real"" science-fiction movie, it is more a fantasy movie to start your imagination. And you have to allow this. A movie about a young girl who asks questions. Who wants to understand it. Who brings adults out of their lethargy, who have given up long ago.Who doesn't see the story of Greta and Fridays for Future made four years before this all started? A prediction of what comes and yeah that is than also pure science fiction. Look carefully at the last scenes of the movie, when it spreads.On the other side it is pretty good entertainment. Humor, emotions, action, future stuff without end, good actors, sometimes unbelievable high pace, a movie like a roller coaster. Fresh, new, different. Absolutely underrated. I love it."
" Underrated gem
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,7,"Looking past its cheesy storytelling devices and cute fx, this movie has a heart of gold. The dialogues at times are weak when they intend to be empowering, but it doesn't stop this movie from being one of few to give a true sense of hope to the audience. I come back to this movie whenever I need a boost."
" Great movie
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,9,"I've always liked George Clooney he's a very good actor, but in this he takes a back seat because the two lead females are so good, Britt Robertson is a geat little actress anyway but she nailed it in this, but for me Raffey Cassidy blew me away with how phenomenal she was.
This is a visually stunning and well made, entertaining movie, I enjoyed it from start to finish."
" the anti-Netflix
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,9,"Brilliance and hopes.
I love this movie.Thank you Brad Bird."
" Disregard negative reviews
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,10,"This movie was fascinating and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The project Altra was real as well in my opinion and based on my research. Wasn't well known but I know In my heart it was real regardless of the mainstream ""facts""."
" Actually, it's pretty good film
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,9,"Watched that for the second time recently, and
realized how good that film really is. You can always be critical and describe why this and that isn't great, but the film is just fine and joy to watch. It reminds me of the Spielberg movies from the 80s."
" Family fun Sci-Fi adventure - better than the reviews led me to believe it would be!
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,7,"How many times have you heard ""Disney"" and ""Bombed at the Box Office""? Not many times , so, sit back and let me tell you about ""Tomorrowland: A World Beyond"" which was directed and co-written by Brad Bird who also directed ""The Iron Giant"" (1999), ""The Incredibles"" (2004), ""Ratatouille"" (2007), ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" (2011), and went on to direct ""Incredibles 2"" in 2018.In detail
In the past, 1964, a boy genius, Frank Walker, finds his way into an alternative dimension called Tomorrowland. It is a place where the cleverest people can co-exist to make a better reality. Fast-forward to the present, presumably 2005, and Casey Newton is living with her brother under the watchful eye of single father Eddie Newton in Cape Canaveral. Space exploration is a forgotten thing, and Eddie being an space flight engineer spends his time working in his garage, which Casey, in her spare time is sabotaging the removal of the rocket platform that is on the outskirts of town. Casey is a genius in her own right and dreams about going into space, she is forever asking the question how to fix the world she lives in. One day she receives a mysterious pin that shows her a vision of Tomorrowland. Hungry for more she attempts to find out about the pin, and gain entry to the mysterious place. She is eventually tracked down by Athena who hails from Tomorrowland and is trying to recruit Casey to help the future of existence. In order to help, Athena convinces Casey to get a much older and grumpy Frank Walker onside too. The idea is that Athena needs both Frank and Casey to stop the world from going through a catastrophic event that kill be the downfall of humanity. The journey to save the World, via Tomorrowland starts - but the trio are tested on the way by conspiracy theories who want in on Tomorrowland, and also by the hierarchy of Tomorrowland itself.In 180 characters
Possibly child genius recruited by mysterious age-less child from alternative reality, to find ex-child genius and save the world. Colourful family adventure from Disney with George Clooney leading the cast.The film tries to recapture a failing passion in the world for some of the things that Walt Disney initially tired to bring to his media and parks - space, futurism, and a sort of utopia. It's a sci-fi adventure film which is mostly grounded on Earth, and an alternative reality of Earth, but does have a moment in space too. ""Tomorrowland"" is a colourful and imaginative film which is visually pretty to look at and flows nicely. Although I am an adult these days, this is still a fun filled film which is as entertaining to me now, as it would have been in my pre-teenage years too.George Clooney leads the cast being a seasoned A-lister that he is. His range is not really tested in this and his performance is not that far removed from other family films he has appeared in. Stealing the show though are Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy who both feel like a good fit for a Disney film. They are fresh and deliver solid performances in their roles. While neither necessarily being Oscar worthy in this, when I compare what they bring against other live-action Disney films of the past, they both fit the bill well and come across as authentic.I have mentioned that the film is visually good. There is a lot of CGI in this film and for the most part it is not off-putting and distracting. This is fuelled by Disney's Industrial Light & Magic, which does not put too many footsteps wrong in this feature. I am fairly sure that this would have blown my mind if I were watching this as a young boy - sure, it's on the family friendly side so it wouldn't necessarily be as cool as something like ""Tron"" (1982) or ""Transformers"" (1986), but it would have still enthralled me. It was hard for as an adult not to see some of the continuity errors that cropped up from time to time (there were a load of them!), but I easily overlooked them because of the sense of fun that was been delivered.I watched this film with my wife, and it is fair to say that she did not enjoy this. She claimed that she feels robbed of 2 hours of her life. Likewise, I have spoken to other people that thought this was a bit weak too. On the other hand, I know that there are some audiences who loved this and cannot understand the negativity and how it bombed at the box office (it cost $190 million and earned $210 million). I kind of sit on the fence, with my feet dangling in the positivity side of the garden. I enjoyed this film, but I know that not everybody will do - I did. It was a fun family adventure which used a Disney-esque steampunky (very loosely of course) sci-fi element, and it made me think of the live action films of Disney's past that I enjoyed, the kind of films that Disney made before they went whole-hog on animation epics. Films like: ""The Island at the Top of the World"" (1974), ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" (1975), ""the Cat From Outer Space"" (1978), ""The Black Hole"" (1979), ""Tron"" (1982), ""The Flight of the Navigator"" (1986), and even ""Flubber"" (1997).So, it may be a film that will divide audiences, but if you give it a go it can still be plenty of fun. As such, I am going to give this a controversial 7 out of 10."
" Food for thought
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,9,"The movie, although it's flaws and plot holes, makes you wonder about some strong ideas in a very cinematic way. The symbol behind it was so realistic and powerful that I was stunned to see the low ranking it got.
The acting was great and the filming was just wonderful."
" Very lovely
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,9,"We loved this movie!
Great story!
Great acting!
Greay visuals!"
" It's an average quality movie but I like it. (6.0)
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,6,"The visual effects are actually very successful, my favorite part is the theme and main idea of the movie, and it really needs to be shown to students in some lessonsI think the message conveyed was important. Although the film is sometimes ridiculous as a subject but the main idea was good, it was just a bit troublesome, I liked it."
" Great film. Please do not let the non dreamers spoil it for you
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,9,"I have just watched this film again and loved it.It has all the feel good factors of a Disney film. You like the charcters, you feel for the characters.Is it cheesy? Of course it is its Disney. But thats the beauty of it. It shows you a world of what could be if we dreamed.....also what could be if we take the ""preacher"" perspective of some of the reviewers.A film is something that is supposed to take you away from reality. It inspires you, it makes you sad it makes you laugh...etc etc. When I read reviews and hear words like ""preachy"" and ""hollow"". I wonder if people that feel that way see films for what they are or just like being critical for the sake of it.In summary watch this film. If you have to switch of your brain whilst doing it, but let the kid in you come out again and think of when you had all of these dreams. For all of Disneys faults in the corperate world they make things like this to keep dreamers dreaming."
" Nice idea, bad execution.
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,5,"The idea was solid and good enough. That being said; the only reason this isn't getting near 0 is due to the effort put in behind the scenes with the impressive graphics and likeable directing.Let me elaborate - The exposition was...interesting. I was more than a little confused and I'm an adult, isn't this meant to be a Disney film that targets the younger audience?Also, the acting is just horrible. Like, horrendous. George Clooney and Britt Robertson are clearly good actors/actresses outside this movie, as seen through The Longest Ride and Oceans 11, so I don't know whether it's the lack of chemistry or the lack of sleep that got to them in this film, but it was disappointing."
" Feel-good , entertaining film
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,7,Tomarrowland is a sci-fi film. It's is entertaining film. All the actors did good acting. It have powerful visuals.
" While the implementation on paper wasn't as good as the potential is, the film as a whole is entertaining
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,6,"An interesting and entertaining film with an idea and execution, which, however, does not succeed as well as there would be potential.The idea is interesting, but some of it hasn't reached its full potential. Something was missing. It's not the fault of the characters, but something. As for the implementation, visually, it's quite beautiful to watch. Very pleasant moments with cgi. A few quite amazing moments even.Although there is something to be said about the story and the script itself, the film is otherwise entertaining."
" I don't recommend it
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,4,It is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen
" An Initially Visually Stunning Film Devolves Quickly...
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,4,"What could've been an inspiring and visually stunning film devolved quickly into a film that I was glad I didn't have to pay to see (I got to stream it for free), and if it hadn't been for the lead actress Britt Robertson whom I admire I'd have just turned it off.What could've been a movie about an alternative land, Tomorrowland which is a visually stunning place initially, instead turns into a decayed message about war, climate change, how we treat one another and what not. These bad vibes are being transmitted across inter-dimensions and to our world by Tomorrowland never mind it's supposed to be fun, exciting, imaginative and a happy place. Never explaining what changed, they're doing this to our world and lamenting about how bad our world is. So...maybe...turn the darn thing off? Maybe if you weren't projecting bad vibes over then things would improve? Just say'n.As I said it's never explained so far as I can tell how Tomorrowland went from a place of fun, excitement, imaginative to a dark desolate place. The actress Britt Robertson in her first feature length blockbuster movie is just wasted as what should've been a tag team effort between her character and Frank Walker, as played by George Clooney, Robertson quickly devolves into sidekick status and the tag team effort is between Walker (Clooney) and Athena (Cassidy). Athena isn't actually a cute smitten little girl but a robot that could give a terminator a run for its fighting money which is not at all believable. She knows where Frank lives in exile but needs someone like Casey (Robertson) to jump start Frank's desire to set things right? What went wrong to begin with? It's never explained fully... And did no one ever notice a rocket ship being built UNDER the Eifel Tower which transforms into its launch platform?I've been wanting to see Tomorrowland for a while, because I'm a fan of Britt Robertson. An initially visually stunning movie quickly devolves into something you'll wish you had passed on. As I said, I'm just glad I got to stream it for free..."
" Why o Why do they Get It So Rong
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,8,Intelligent tense inventive brilliantly filmed and directed with Clooney in a wonderfully against any type perfectly executed role. what's not to like!?What's wrong with the film critic industry anyway? My friends and I have agreed that it is now useless. We mourn the loss of Roger Ebert once again. Best of love to his widow. It was wonderful to see them together those last year's.
" Tomorrowland on 4k ultra hd
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,9,"Been a while since I've seen it. I remember it having fantastic PQ but damn forgot how stunning it really is. I hope Disney would give this a proper UHD release. This blows quite a few UHD discs away. The opening scene with George Clooney, such detail in everything Have there been any talk/rumors of a 4K release of this visually stunning title? Am I correct in assuming this was not released in IMAX format for bluray? Still the last great live action Disney movie IMO now on upgrade Upscaled 4K coming soon on Disney 4k ultra hd release February 2021"
" Wish it was greater, but for what it is it's still enjoyable
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,7,"Wish it was greater, but for what it is it's still enjoyable.'Tomorrowland' is an intriguing futuristic film, it doesn't really delve as deep into its potential-filled premise as it should but it scratches the surface and it makes for - just about - solid viewing. The special effects are very nice, also.As for the casting, I guess it could've been better. However, I did like the main quartet of Britt Robertson (Casey), George Clooney (Frank), Raffey Cassidy (Athena) and Hugh Laurie (David) - the latter has a good rant late on. I rate the way the story is told, mostly in retrospective by Robertson and Clooney - it keeps it interesting.I just feel more should've been done with this, given it's fairly entertaining even in its current state and has a load of potential. Either way, I did narrowly like it."
" Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,6,"Having gotten Disney+ for free for 6 months thanks to my phone company,I decided to look for more overlooked titles. Only having heard about the film in relation to it being a flop at the box office and a Brad Bird credit,I got set to escape to tomorrow.View on the film:Soaring onto the screen a project he had turned down directing Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015-also reviewed) in order to make, co-writer/ (with Damon Lindelof and Jeff Jensen) director Brad Bird & Life of Pi (2012-also reviewed) cinematographer Claudio Miranda ignite a Adventure movie atmosphere with a opening tribute to The Rocketeer (1991-also reviewed) that powers up outstanding special effects which seamlessly crosses Newton (played by a plucky Britt Robertson) between the real world and Tomorrowland at her fingertips.Flying between the gadget thrills of his Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011-also reviewed) and the retro Sci-Fi of The Iron Giant (1999) Bird fills every corner of the screen with loving tributes to Sci-Fi flicks/characters,from Star Wars merch covering the store Newton visits to learn more about the Tomorrowland badge, to a ""Stargate"" being at the centre of the land, sparked in stylish 5 minute long one-take tracking shots gazing at the futuristic world.Keeping the head of Tomorrowland (played by a wonderfully hammy Hugh Laurie) chewing the Stargate scenery, Bird intelligently plays round the PG rating with the decision to make most of the baddies robots, allowing for explosive beat-downs that swing beheaded robots across the screen.Starting with a timer that pays tribute to his work on ""Lost"", the fingerprints of bumbling co-writer hack Damon Lindelof runs close to damaging all that Bird makes work on screen, with the ""Mystery Box"" of how to enter Tomorrowland (from it clearly being set-up of having to stay in the real world) being illogically changed with a flick of a switch that offers no answers.Lecturing at the audience a environmental message that stops the Sci-Fi dead in its tracks, (Lindelof can't do subtle) Lindelof shuts the enticing exploration of Tomorrowland's futurism with a dire ""across the world"" final undermining the challenges faced by the leads to enter the location, which is all neatly tied in a romance between George Clooney and a robot who looks 12 years old in the world of tomorrow."
" Today
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,6,This was a fun and pretty looking movie with George clooney and cool future stuff.Go and check it out
" Bright
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,8,"Was a quit good film. I really loved the frames. The flow from the starting of th film was uphill. You can't wait for the final thing. The content was really a complicated but the was they conveyed was easily understandable. The one negative of the film is, it was too bright and saturated."
" They was robbed
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,8,"It's not terribly rare that a movie does not get reviews that give it to credit it deserves. This movie was entertaining, mysterious, well written, and really well acted.This is not a throwaway role for George Clooney. He plays a very interesting part here that he has not tried anywhere else. Do yourself a favor and see this movie!"
" Snowflake, vanilla marshmallow soup without any flavour
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,5,"The movie is bland, the acting is fine, the effects are fine. The directing is... well... white.What strikes me about this movie is the lack of diversity. Sure the World Fair in 1964 was white, that is historically acurate.But in the 'future' all are white (except the one diversity hire as the female astronaut, that does not count. Especially since they gave her (parents) an Indian accent while no one else has an accent).The whole population is white. They seem to think the 'great minds' were all white.The whole female population is slattered in make up, propped up on high heels and sqeezed into tight clothes.Not a good day for equalism."
" Stylish, inventive caper hindered by heavy handed preaching.
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,7,"Tomorrowland was given a hard time by the critics. Two thirds of the way through I couldn't see why. It's a fun, family movie with an interesting original premise. There's plenty of action, a surprising amount of comedy and an engaging cast (Robertson really shines here and proves herself a very capable physical comedian!). Plus the whole film looks stunning. A glorious production design presents a future that feels tangibly modern yet simultaneously retro, presenting playful nods to the 1950s vision of the future Disney built in its theme parks. Plus there's a potent, positive message at the heart of it. What's your problem? And then we get into the third act. Pacing issues start to creep in, the underlying conspiracy at the heart of the story becomes a little confusing and then the environmental message is delivered full force straight between the eyes. It's a shame. If Bird had deftly delivered the moral core of Tomorrowland the film could have been both a powerful and enjoyable mainstream movie. Yet it's didactic final tone is so heavy handed it makes even the most liberal minded viewer (like me) feel a little awkward. However up until then Tomorrowland is fresh and fun. I guess if it does sacrifice that in the end by trying to galvanise us to save the world, there's worse cinematic crimes."
" Extremely disappointed.
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,2,I watched this because the previews looked promising. I was wrong. The characters are annoying. They do not mesh to-gether. The story seemed promising but IMO it fell flat. The 2 stars are for the flashback of the 64 World's Fair. Great place!
" Great Movie..
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,9,"Finally watched this film.. I was very surprised how awesome it was.. Acting by all actors was great and the story was very interesting..
The special effects were awesome also..I'm very glad I finally decided to watch this film. It's a great SciFi and should be watched.
Very well done... 😊"
" Couldn't make Sense of it.
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,1,I managed to get through one hour and then didn't care to continue trying to understand it. I see it's by the writer who messed up LOST. Say no more.
" Great Movie...
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,10,"Quite unexpected, really good movie.
I like the concept, it's all very Disney with some great SiFi and effects thrown in.
It shouldn't have been a kids movie but I dare say it would of been much darker had it been aimed at adults.
Either way it's a triumph of cinema, seriously!!
One to add to your must watch list.."
" I'm 49...and its my all time favourite film
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,10,"This is my first review. The only reason im doing this is because for some bizarre reason this film isnt appreciated as it should be. Some of my all time favourite movie scenes are in this movie (the Police Station and Frank's House scenes are hilarious). Its inventive, imaginative, funny, exciting, tender and I wish it had been around when I was a kid.As for some reviewers and critics saying that the film was preachy at the end. Did this film have a message? Yes. Was it hard to hear some of the Hugh Laurie speech? Maybe. Why? The truth hurts sometimes. This film is about hope though and always leaves me with a feeling of just that.It gets an extra star for the best natural screen burp. Seriously hilarious"
" Once again, the critics are wrong
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"While the film was a little preachy in some parts, I enjoyed it as a whole. It felt like watching ""Meet the Robinsons,"" which I loved. The one thing I didn't expect (especially in a Disney movie) was the warning about dystopian futures. It uses books like ""1984,"" and ""Fahrenheit 451"" as examples. There is one scene where there's a vintage comic shop and there's Star Wars merchandise everywhere. (Subtle, Disney) I really enjoyed the positive message the movie has to offer, and highly recommend this film to everyone. If Brad Bird directs ""The Incredibles 2"" half as well as he directed this, I'm excited for it. He declined to direct ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" to direct this, and that was still a good decision because this movie is amazing!
Grade: A- 9/10. 4/5 stars"
" Not bad at all
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,8,"Not sure why all the bad reviews, plenty of action, not badly acted and visual effects ok. Worth a watch"
" Just amazing
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,9,Watch it twice. First time is just getting familiar with concepts. Second time is amazing. Leave a gap of a few days so it's almost like new the second time.
" For a kids movie. LOADS of blasphemy, and language.
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,1,"So whoever the potty mouth who wrote this was, they could not resist including language.- (Especially the blasphemy for us) -that offends.
Not everyone. But still millions of adults who are either religious. Or just decent when it comes to language.
As well as all the parents who do not want their children growing up using these expletive.Have a look at ""Parents guide first. See what I mean. Someone has listed the amount of needless, profanities.And by needless, people who dont mind would not miss it in the slightest.
People who do, turn it off. Or just dont watch.Shame it could have been an enjoyable movie."
" Filled with Filler Instead of Wonder
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,3,"I remember not liking this movie when I saw it in the theater. I watched it again today, and still did not enjoy it.
The first problem is that it doesn't know if it's a kid's movie or one for an older audience. It seems to be geared to a younger audience, but then you see people being blasted into a blue goo, it seems more gory than it needed to be.
The next problem is the second half of the movie feels like it's mostly filler. Like the trip from the house to the other dimension, how many steps did that take? What? Why did it take 20 or 30 minutes to show all that?
And then the ending and explanation for why things were happening didn't make sense. I guess it was supposed to be a morality tale about humans and caring about the planet. I'm not sure how negative thoughts would have brought about flooding.
So I would say feel free to give this movie a shot, but don't expect much out of it."
" One of my favorite movies of all time.
",2020-01-21 00:00:00,10,"THIS is a good movie. It's sci fi/fantasy, a feel good movie. When you don't want a movie to take itself too seriously, not in the mood for a Hollywood political statement movie, and just want to have fun watching something pleasurable, watch this movie. Character performances of Frank Walker (young and old), Casey, Athena and Nix are all a joy to watch. Just pure fun. I had a grin on my face throughout the whole movie. Made me feel like a kid again. I have watched this movie multiple times and like it as much each time. Once of those movies that will stay in the library within reach when I just want to watch something fun that is not too heavy."
" Started out OK then just went on and on
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,6,"I thought Tomorrowland started out quite entraining, funny and exciting. I liked the early sixties theme park parts, the futuristic parts and particularly like the battle with the bots in the comic book store, or whatever that was. But after that it just seemed to go on and on. It wasn't a bad film by any stretch, it had good acting, it looked good and there were some good ideas. But it was far too long and maybe should have been limited to just a few of those ideas."
" Awesome sci-fi movie
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,9,This is an awesome sci-fi movie with a very interesting story.
" GREAT CINEMATOGRAPHY
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,8,This movie takes you in to the life of the movie. ignore all reviews and watch it.
" Feed the right wolf
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,10,"This is a really good plot. If you build something with a defined positive intent but the idea didn't get received in that manner due to the sheer perception which has so many variables to affect it which no one was able to factor in, would you give up hope and let everything go to hell! Sounds similar to the notion of 'Ultron' and is too, in a way. It is a weird balance to have, in my opinion; if you live in a condition of utter bliss being impractically optimistic and miss counteracting the negatives, things are doomed but if you keep propagating bad news all the time, even though with a good intent to draw people's attention to fixing the negatives, you might unknowingly spread more negativity causing things to be doomed too! You have to watch the film to get what I am saying here. And so I hope that we attain the much needed - 'Peace in our time'."
" Extremely disappointing
",2019-10-22 00:00:00,3,"This will not be a helpful review. I just thought this movie had real potential. I was so excited for it, but I found it extremely dry. There's so many things they could've done with this film but instead it just copied a thousand other movies"
" not even for KIDS
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,2,Just don't waste the time...stupid kids movie if released in 1990....not acceptable in 21st century
" fun though a bit raggedy
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,8,"Tomorrowland is a spiffy sci-fi flick about robots and hope. The movie begins in the 60s with a boy working to build a jetpack, then jumps ahead a few decades to a young woman with dreams of her own.

" Not what I was expecting
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,5,"I wasn't expecting this movie to be what it was. I thought it was going to be like a family friendly equivalent to ""Blade Runner"" I thought most of it was going to be set in the future. It turns out to be a movie mostly set in present day with an environmental message. I agreed with the message but I didn't expect this movie to be about that, I was expecting it to be like 2009's ""Astro Boy"" or even Disney's ""Meet The Robinsons"" but better."
" Tomorrowland constructs itself for a brighter future, but crumbles with its cumbersome admonition.
",2019-09-24 00:00:00,5,"Optimism. The glass half full. The irreverent shrouding of hope for future success. In a modern world plagued by apathy and self-destruction, even the most minuscule amount of positivity can change an entire brigade of pessimistic attitudes. Yet Tomorrowland's ironic perspective on succeeding has fallen into the realms of failure, in what is director Bird's one and only misfire. No fault of his own ambition, but the unfortunate storytelling mishaps of Lindelof's screenplay that transformed a world of wonder into a stern lecture. A teenage scientist discovers an alternate dimension built by the world's greatest scientists and must team up with a disillusioned inventor to prevent the world from destroying itself.To dream of a better future. To strive for excellence. To become a better person. Retaining optimism, in a reality driven by cynicism, is irrefutably challenging. The mark of a genius consistently dreaming and thinking of a brighter future. Bird's exploration into futurism and all its ideals, is an ambitious passion project that holds its mechanical heart with the warmest of embraces. Tinkering along to the sound of outstanding visual aesthetics, accompanied by innovative futuristic architecture, and overwhelming positivity. Encapsulating the inventiveness of its characters with indestructible mechanisms that provide the plot with a greater meaning.The sole problem with the entire inception of Tomorrowland though, is just how incredibly basic the dimensional story is. The mystery revolving around the titular realm is less of a jigsaw puzzle and more reminiscent of a ""dot-to-dot"" activity sheet. The entirety of its premise is instantly laid out from the initial flashback sequence of a young Frank. The pestilence of optimism, right from that introductory erratic false smile of hope. Luring you into an advanced Disney-like cityscape, unequivocally not a ""small world"" (Damn, I loathe that song), that allows Lindelof to stretch his heavy-handed storytelling muscles. ""Please welcome to the auditorium to give his lecture on positivity, Professor Lindelof!"". Aside from the first half that executes its imaginative mystery well, to a certain degree, Lindelof clearly struggled to adapt to a family-friendly story (considering darker titles 'Prometheus' and 'Star Trek: Into Darkness'). With that, he clearly believed that the younger generation had limited intelligence, by issuing a conclusive half that reprimanded as opposed to inspired.See, instead of providing an insight into the positive outlook on life, he opted for a sizeable twenty minute berate regarding humanity's self-destruction. The ever-changing harsh environment as a result of humanity's carelessness. Overpopulation. Disease. Pollution. The list is endless. It almost reminded me of Michael Jackson's music video for 'Earth Song'. Disappointment arises from not the actual substance, as it is an eternally important message, but the method to which it's imparted. It overwhelming dissolves the optimistic perspective that preceded this overbearing talk. Yet that isn't the only issue. Clooney, not completely adversed to family-friendly flicks, had the emotional range of a burnt crumpet. Cassidy's accent was all over the place. And Robertson was surprisingly monotonous. Only Laurie provided the chops, and was merely pushed aside for Lindelof's discourse.A crushing disappointment, not because the film is bad, but due to the vast amount of missed opportunities. Bird's buoyant direction keeps this adventure afloat, but Lindelof anchors down a premise that should've been towering over Tomorrowland. The message is there. The morality exists. But it seems apathy took the glory this time."
" A beautiful and poignant film...
",2019-09-21 00:00:00,10,"I didn't expect this depth of thought and emotion...so beautifully told and shot. Just because we are led to believe what the future is, doesn't mean we are resigned to it! Be proactive! The future isn't written yet! There's still time! BE THE MIRACLE!"
" Grossly Underrated Motion Picture
",2019-08-27 00:00:00,9,"The poor showing in the box office and worldwide gross receipts has to be attributed to poor marketing. As a SciFi aficionado, I would have seen this movie at its showing. I honestly never saw any commercials promoting the film or trailers in the theatre. I missed it. I first viewed it on DVD 2 years ago, and thought it fantastic. As dystopia as ""1984"" with its Socialism message was, ""Tomorrowland"" is full of optimism and promise of a near Utopian Capitalism future. A bonus for me was the opening scenes showing the 1964 NY Worlds Fair at which I spent many days. The subplot involving time/event manipulation was thought provoking. A must see movie that will not disappoint."
" Good Holiday Movie
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,8,"Please, please, ignore the critics! They will tell you 'It wasn't Citizen Caine or ""The Seventh Veils"" or ""My Dinner with Andre"". ""It did not convey the meaning of life"". They said the same thing about ""Superman"" and others. This was a good movie and after renting it I purchased it to watch with my grandchildren, teen nieces and nephews and parents during the holidays"
" Under-rated film
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,9,"Yeah, it's essentially a commercial for DisneyWorld. I've never been there. I can't see myself getting there. I am disturbed by the bad reviews for this film. For the third time watching it on tv I have been captivated by it. Admittedly it starts out really slow. Once the daughter of the fabulous Tim McGraw meets the robot Athena, who is an awesome actor. I could not stop watching."
" A Classic Movie in Modern Times
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,9,"I watch a lot of movies, many pass me by, enjoyable but not groundbreaking.During and after this movie I was emotionally affected, it was a lovely story of hope, loss, childlike dreams, action and Brad Bird is excellent at the family dynamic and dialogue - having worked on other excellent films such as The Incredibles,I stopped by the IMDB page to see what the scrore was - and for once, I have to say, it's WAY off something that I expected or agree with.I don't know what happened the critics or the public. But this is fantasy, sci-fi and action at its best. It reminds me a lot of old 80s adventure films like Daryl, Flight of the Navigator, War Games etc. but more complex, modern effects and a wonderful cast.I hope this deserves a cult following or becomes a lesser known rare gem. It deserves far more praise and attention that its score of a mere '6' (at present) on IMDB."

" Fantastically directed movie, squandered by the writing cancer that is Damon Lindelof
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,5,"This movie was at the top of my most looked forward to for 2015. Brad Bird had just come off revamping Mission Impossible with arguably the best movie the series had seen. He also made two of Pixar's most perfect films with The Incredibles and Ratatouille.I was ready for Bird to take us on a fun mystery of a story with writing as good as those past three movies of his. But then, the screenplay found itself with a cancerous mass attached to it that called itself Damon Lindelof. He took the whimsical story that Bird had made, and brought it down to an unintelligible mess of a movie. With his other movies like Star Trek Into Darkness, Prometheus, and Cowboys & Aliens, Tomorrowland became just another in long line of uneven storytelling that thought it was smarter than everyone else in the world.A lot about this movie is great. The performances are fantastic, the cinematography is really cool and the retro aspects to it make it visually fun to watch. At the heart, you can see the Brad Bird creativeness breaking through the cracks of the mess of a Lindelof screenplay that this movie is crumbling into. But Bird's directing isn't able to overcome the mess that Lindelof made of the screenplay.As with every Lindelof project, the ending is so lackluster and anti-climactic. This guy does not know how to end stuff! Fans of Lost know that all too well.Brad Bird should have been the sole writer on this. We would have gotten another retro inspired world like The Incredibles, movie full of whimsical charm like Ratatouille, with some great action set pieces like Ghost Protocol. But instead we got Brad Bird filtered through the crap spewing machine that is Damon Lindelof.Please, any spectacular film makers, DO NOT work with Lindelof at all. Its plain to see he is a cancer who ruins productions. Brad Bird escaped the Lindelof disease and came back with The Incredibles 2 which is arguably better than the first!I'd love to see this concept and creativity happen again without the pitiful excuse of a screen writer, but it seems like Disney isn't gonna do any live-action stuff that isn't Marvel, Star Wars or re-makes. Damon Lindelof singlehandedly ruined us ever getting a Tron 3 for the foreseeable future. Thanks Dumbass Lindelof!"
" Terrible Film That Takes Forever To Get Going
",2019-06-07 00:00:00,1,"Can't believe people liked this but, if gadgets, effects thrill you it's okay. This film takes forever to get moving. A story needs a Beginning, a Middle, and an End. This one stays in first gear through a series of scenes that are little more than misadventures laced with gadgets, an annoying, difficult, argumentative protagonist in Britt Robertson as Casey who argues relentlessly against anyone trying to help. She's a very annoying character. Raffey Cassidy as the young girl Athena is the only thing that keeps the film alive. Her character adds intrigue, gets you wondering plus you genuinely like her - she's not annoying. Okay, so the film and cast stumble along through one huge beginning of predictable action scenes, mishaps, and the usual screaming. The film has no real Middle just a long disappointing End. I mean really, all that to get to ""that"". It wasn't even a clever film, just a lot of Disney style antics and effects"
" LET'S GO FIND OUT
",2019-05-23 00:00:00,8,"This is one of those kid (s) save the world film where a girl is the hero/role model. There was an outcry for more positive female role models, and Hollywood appears to have responded, if not over responded.Most reviews of this film avoid talking about the plot, as most adults don't know exactly what is going on as the story is a bit confused, especially when tachyon time travel viewing is involved. Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) a bright teen girl who likes science (no talking ""math is hard"" Barbies allowed). She gets it and cares. She is inundated with the doom and gloom messages of global disaster and wants to ""fix it"" unlike most of the apathetic planet who want to market the concept. She meets Athena (Raffey Cassidy) a time and dimension traveling android who has her team with inventor Frank Walker (George Clooney) to save the world.The film could be said to have a liberal bias, but blames humanity as a whole for not acting, without specifically mentioning climate deniers. It was apparent who they were talking about without mentioning their name. Warning: The film might be inspiration and a call to action for your youngster who might believe they can make a difference.The film had great special effects, but has heavy parts when it gets bogged down with the message."
" Cashing in on another Disney attraction.
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,6,"A bit heavy-handed with its message (which took forever to get to), as well as its Disney and Brad Bird references, ""Tomorrowland"" attempts to take another less-tangible concept and expand it into a feature film: while I really enjoy the films made by Brad Bird, this ends up falling somewhere between ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean""."
" Why the hype for Athena?
",2019-04-15 00:00:00,2,"This film is dull and a mess of a script. People giving decent reviews - if you found something decent here then good for you but the thing I really can't understand is that even in the bad reviews, and overriding comment is ""The acting of Athena is what holds it together"" and ""we'll be hearing more from her""... No no no no no! I nearly quit this film half way through because of her overacting and overpronunciation of everything. I can only assume the hype is brought by Americans who fail to detect the god-awful and frankly ridiculous English ""Oh HellLLLOOO"" accent she's got. Reminds me of an exaggerated version of the overacting of the kids in the earliest Harry Potter films and it was so distracting and like nails on a chalkboard that it's a miracle I stayed till the end of this one."

" Tomorrowland Review
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,8,"Given a badge that takes her to an alternative world, Casey (Robertson) looks for an explanation.
There are two ways to view the use of theme-park rides as inspiration for movies. The first, held by many, is it represents a dearth of ideas and a grab for anything with a smidge of brand recognition and, therefore, a small leg-up at the box office. But there is another, less cynical view and it's embodied by Brad Bird's sugared-up, awestruck adventure: if you start with something that fires kids' imaginations, but has no inherent plot, you have no limits. The lack of defined story makes the plot possibilities endless, and there is nothing more exciting than an unfettered mind.
A vague brief means freedom. Tomorrowland is technically not even based on a ride; it's based on an entire theme-park zone. Walt Disney made Tomorrowland part of the original Disneyland in 1955 to represent a future crackling with potential. He believed that the next day would always be better, more thrilling and more full of blinking lights and beepy robots than the last. So why, asks Bird, has the future become something we fear? When did it stop making us dream of wearing jumpsuits on the moon and start making us look for a place to hide when the end comes?
Bird's story is told via Casey (Britt Robertson) and Frank (George Clooney). Frank was a child brimming with the wonder of science. A visit to the 1964 New York World Fair to show off the jetpack he invented, which almost worked, introduced him to a shady Steve Jobs/Walt Disney character (Laurie) and, somehow, a hidden futuristic world. Then, for reasons not initially revealed, he grew into a right old grump - going into hiding and depriving the world of his brain. Casey has what Frank lost. She believes that anything is possible, what's broken can be fixed and that the best-case scenario is no less likely than the worst. Given a mysterious pin that transports her to the alternative world Frank once knew, she determines to find out what, where and when it is.
This is all in about the first 20 minutes and we'll leave the set-up there. Tomorrowland is a film that benefits from little knowledge before you buckle in, which is good, because trying to explain its plot would take up the rest of this review. If that sounds like a negative, it is not. Bird and screenwriting partner Damon Lindelof (co-creator of Lost) have constructed a story in which you really don't know what's going to happen next. It's a rare thrill. In so many family action films the best you can hope for is a multiple-choice option - will the hero beat the villain now or in around 25 minutes? Yet here there is constant surprise, interesting ideas, and Bird's enthusiasm as a director never lets up.
Bird has always directed with a natural wonder and curiosity. He's the sort of filmmaker who grabs your hand, gasps, ""You'll never believe what's over here!"" and then drags you there, running and breathless. He's like a very clever little boy who needs to get everything out of his head before he bursts. Half the shots in the film seem to be pointed upwards to reinforce that sense of childish amazement. There is one sequence, in which Frank's heavily booby-trapped house is attacked by evil, grinning robots, that crams in so many mad, exuberant moments of invention that you immediately want to go back and watch again to catch the detail you missed. Bird revels in his world.
Despite all the futuristic business, there is a retro tone. Tomorrowland harks back to a time before the prevailing cinematic mood was one of darkness and grit. Here are flavours of Back To The Future, The Goonies, The Rocketeer, and non-specific Spielberginess. If there's such a thing as 'an '80s feel' then this has it, and if it's possible to define it, then it's the belief that kids are the ones who best understand the world and all its potential weirdness, and adults who have become foolish through loss of curiosity.
Uncharacteristically for Bird, the relationships don't stick together as well as they might. This has always been one of Bird's strengths as a filmmaker: he made a giant robot a curious little brother in The Iron Giant; he detailed the struggles of a marriage through superpowers in The Incredibles; he gave a rat daddy issues in Ratatouille. But there isn't that depth and lightness of touch here. Casey's relationship with her dad is much more discussed than shown, and the bruised friendship between Frank and the little girl (Raffey Cassidy) who brought him to Tomorrowland feels in need of a few more scenes to cement it - though their final exchange offers the best, most resonant line of the movie.
All the cast are on spirited form. We haven't seen Clooney in this kind of summer blockbuster since (whisper it) Batman & Robin, and he appears to be having a much better time here, bringing hints of Everett McGill's madcap nature in O Brother, Where Are Thou? - only in a worse mood and not nearly so dim. Britt Robertson is an equal treat, finding the sweet spot between confidence and confusion and showing strong comic timing. Cassidy works well as the de facto adult, despite being pre-teen.
It may be incredibly mean to criticise a movie so packed with ideas for not having enough, but the rocket runs out of fuel towards the end. Lindelof has always been great at set-ups, but less so with conclusions. He and Bird settle on an ending that's by no means poor, but it doesn't delight like everything it follows and slips onto the rails it's avoided for so long. Still, Tomorrowland lands its message well and sends you on your way, head fizzing with exhilaration and what-ifs. And, in that sense, it's done exactly what it planned to."
" Garbage
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,1,"I'm not a paid review-writer who pretends to be an average movie goer who never writes reviews, so I actually will keep it short. The teen is a terrible actress and her character is super annoying. All she does is scream and ask stupid, pointless questions. The plot isn't revealed till the end of the movie, which often works, but failed miserably in this one. It's just a bunch of propaganda and yet more demonizing of an entire sector of society. Typical. Don't waste your time on this boring, annoying, shallow pile of trash."
" Not your usual Disney movie.
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,5,"With a very beautiful message that got lost along the way. Unfortunately. Or misunderstood/overlooked by some. True, the movie is way too long and somewhat convoluted, but if you stick to it hard enough you might enjoy it. And what's not to like? A good cast (Clooney, Robertson, Laurie and Rafferty, to name a few. Even Hahn's cameo is great), great special effects, a compelling story once things really take off, and lots of action. I gave the movie a chance, after hearing so many bad things about it. And I'm glad I did. Maybe you will too."
" Tomorrowland is far from horrible
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,8,"On first hearing about Tomorrowland, you'd think it's a Tron Legacy rip-off. When really that's what people want you to believe. Brad Bird puts his usual adventure spin on things along with some great humor. The story is inspiring and worth a watch. George Clooney does well on his role and I love Raffrey Cassidy, she's a great aspiring actress.Tomorrowland was released at a terrible time though, it was released the same year as the Star Wars The Force Awakens, and Disney was aggressively advertising that film. Although, this film beats Force Awakens by a large mark. Highly recommend."
" Loved the movie and the cast !!!
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,10,"Really liked this movie. I have watched this movie when it was just lended to the theatre. The posters and the trailer appealed me so much that the second it was dropped in the theatre, I went and watched it. My expectations were very high and fortunately, the movie matched them. It was well directed, the actors played their roles very well and the storyline and the idea were unique and interesting. Overall, I liked it vey much and will be happy if in the future the directors create the second part of this movie."
" The plot is fragmented
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,5,"The plot is fragmented, and wants to show the ""future"" world, but is unwilling to give up the local links, but also self-righteous to start with a flashback.

",2019-01-24 00:00:00,10,"I remembered the day when I watched tomorrowland. The film with many life thoughts and science inspirations. As a scientis with many dreams, this movie gave me a lot of inspiration. When I was watching it, I felt like I could do whatever I want and also whenever I want.This feelings I have, when I whatching science films. But this one, gives me the most science feelings, it inspirate me. Many people hate this movie because of the boring plot, but the main thought of it is to make people believe the impossible. Tomorrowland wants to give you an exrta eye and wants to tell you ""Hey, your dream makes you special , do not afraid, to make it real "". So I definitely recommend watching this movie."
" Tomorrowland awaits
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,8,"Tomorrowland is an excellent movie! I love how the movie was not based on any one existing Disney property, but an entire part of their parks. Tomorrowland was fascinating, it was enjoyable, it was all around a great film! Ehy do people not like this film?Casey is a great lead character who reminds me of myself when I was younger, and Frank Walker is one of those characters who comes off as rude and a jerk beforehand, but slowly cHnges throughout the course of the film.I didnt think this film dragged on too long, and I dont think it was preachy in the slightest, and i thought the idea of tomorrowland having four famous inventors find it and build it in another dimension was interesting.Hugh Laurie was amazing as the villain of the movie and I live the homage of his most famous character, Gregory House, when I piece of Tomorrowland crushed his leg in the climax.Tomorrowland should get more praise than what it does. It is one of the most underrated gems I've seen in a while"
" A Breath Taking Vision of the Future
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,8,"31 May 2015. It's hard to speculate whether like Avatar (2009) the novelty of the fresh new look of a movie has a lot to do with a movie's popularity or rating. In Tomorrowland there is both the initial nostalgic retro-feel of a glorified past 50s at the New York World's Fair which I did attend as a child and the fantastic images of a future that really never gets the brilliant and spectacular vision of hope and optimism. Unlike the sci fi classic Blade Runner (1982) and its dark vision of Los Angeles, Tomorrowland presents a different look. It's a look that is so enticingly omitted at the end of The Day Time Ended (1979) a rather mediocre sci fi movie that involves time travel.This family Disney sci fi adventure has a family connection element, a children's element, and except for some deadly live action scenes that seems out of character for a family Disney movie, this entertaining and emotionally appealing movie captures a step above the ordinary sci fi movie. Unlike Orson Scott Card's Enders Game (2013) there is more a personal, relational dynamic that plays with fate, destiny, and imagination of the innocent, wondrous, special type."
" The planet is in enormous danger..
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,9,"I was blown away by this movie and was incredibly impressed by those who made it.
The planet is in enormous danger and this is one of a few movies that warns us of what will happen if we don't pay attention.. Others were 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' (original version) and ""How it Ends'.
I haven't seen it but 'Mother' did the same thing but most didn't understand what it was about. It was an entire metaphor.
'Tomorrowland' did it in an entertaining way with characters we liked but the message wasn't realized until the very end. When some say they didn't like the end, it's because it was so simple, just like the end of ""How it Ends'.....we didn't listen and it's now too late.
It's difficult to make a movie that entertains everybody but is actually a warning of what's to come. This movie and the ones listed above did good jobs of doing that. However, most people still aren't getting it."

",2018-11-30 00:00:00,9,"Another gem by Brad Bird although marred by a lacklustre ending.Action galore and a well crafted plot that keeps you guessing what's really happening. It's also incredibly violent by Disney standards so I'm surprised they didn't release it on one of their other labels.Action fans really need to give it a go even though it's a ""Disney"" film.

" A hopeful vision of tomorrow
",2018-10-19 00:00:00,7,"I went into this movie expecting to hate it. Based on what I'd heard, I was planning for a clunker with bad effects. I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised. The visuals are amazing, and the plot is hopeful and interesting, centered mostly around a negative ""self-fulfilling prophecy"" playing out in our reality. Without getting into spoilers, there's a good reason for our current obsessions with negativity and dystopia and apocalyptic zombie movies. We're being told the world is going to hell, and we're buying into it.I can understand some of the negative criticism. There are too many CGI robots, enough to make action scenes feel boring. A weird tonal shift happens early on, amping up the violence and throwing viewers for a loop. And many of the action scenes feel hurried and overworked. The ten-minute house invasion section was so rushed, a dozen nifty inventions are thrown at the viewer so quickly, they can't be appreciated. Plot holes and ""wait, what?"" moments abound, as they do in most big films nowadays. I hate being asked to not only suspend my disbelief but ignore things like physics. When a huge metal ball explodes over your head, you run away. When the film shows it crashing onto a platform where your character was standing, the viewer thinks: ""oh, my, is she dead?"" Of course not. She's fine, and it's not explained. People fall in water and are dry in the next moment. Humans are vaporized by mean robots and nobody cares or notices. It feels like a great fourth draft of a script that needed a little more polishing.Unfortunately, the movie feels 20% too preachy, hitting us over the head with dangers like global warming and obesity and famine. But it takes a hopeful view, assuming that, if we work together, we can solve these problems and others. It's a hopeful message, something akin to the 1950s and 60s when the world was recovering from a devastating world war and anything seemed possible and we were landing people on the moon and making strides on social issues like civil rights and the prevention of global conflicts. Clooney and the other actors are good, although the lead actress seemed a little overwhelmed, and you can't base a huge movie like this on essentially four characters. They needed more people and more character arcs to make it have an impact.But, in the end, this hopeful film asks us to believe that progress is a good thing, but only if that progress is in the service of good. This movie trades in a different message: hope, and hopefulness, and using our combined smarts to figure out solutions to problems. That's not something you hear a lot any more, and it was refreshing to see, especially in a big Hollywood blockbuster. It harkens back to that old Einstein saying, which is highlighted in once scene: ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" And that's not a bad thing."

" Nicely Done!
",2018-06-11 00:00:00,8,"Yet another terribly underrated movie. Of course it has it's issues. There are so many brilliant ideas in there and it's just not possible to fully develop them all in the course of a two hour movie. As a result the movie does have a bit of an ""all over the place"" feeling to it.However it's still a very good story line, and there's a lot of creativity involved. The cinematography and visuals are quite impressive and even character development is quite alright. Altogether a great movie that deserves a much higher rating than this."
" No review gets it: It's a love story
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,7,"I loved this movie. What it's actually about is unrequited love and reconciliation. The relationship between the 60 something man (Clooney) and the 12 year old in appearance android (Cassidy), is about love in its deepest sense. The main plot is about a brilliant boy who never earns praise from his father. In consequence, he eventually expresses his unconscious disappointment and rage in the creation of machine that nearly destroys the world by amplifying the same negativity in the entire human race.While still a boy, he falls in the love with the android. This turns the Pygmalion story on its head as it is her emotional support that enables him to develop his true intellectual power.When he discovers that she is a machine, he is bitterly disappointing that she cannot love him back in the way he imagines. He believes he is betrayed by her just as he felt betrayed by his father. The android sends him an prophetess, who like Moses, discovers her true purpose almost by accident--she helps him save humanity from their own self-destruction. At the end, his true love sacrifices herself to save him. Only then is he freed from the past and is redeemed, and the android embraces her humanity--the Pinocchio theme.Note that the structure of the narrative follows the Odyssey. It is epic.I would work on this review a bit to make it a bit clearer, but you get the idea. Think on it. I know it is correct because the actors caught the emotions perfectly. No wonder it was a failure. Too subtle. And, perhaps not Politically Correct either even though there was no hint of sexuality."
" Soulless
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,4,"Having endured no less than four of the interminable PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movies, I had no stomach for sitting through yet another film based on a theme park attraction, yet when I saw TOMORROWLAND on TV I decided to give it a go. After all, the presence of the ever-charming George Clooney had to be a good thing, right? Actually, the answer is no. This is a cheap, superficial kind of film, an adventure fronted by kids in which the narrative seems to be made up of the stringing together of various genre tropes, all melded together with a big dollop of CGI. It looks nice, but I found it hollow in the extreme, lacking decent characterisation and any kind of depth whatsoever. Soulless, in other words."
" Really enjoyed this film
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,10,"I don't often come across a film that ticks all the boxes, but this one did."
" The future is now
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,10,Loved this film and the acting. Enjoyable plot great special effects. Likeable cast. Liked the main characters. I was intreged from the start and just had to keep watching to the end. People who liked this will also like time travel films or even different dimensions films.
" Disjointed mess of a movie
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,3,"Thus was all over the shop as so many others have observed, which for me was encapsulated by the vaporisation of the three cops investigating the exploding sci-fi store: for a family friendly Disney film their sudden demise seemed incongruous! Plus the protagonist commits arson setting Frank's combine harvester on fire."
" 10/10 you are all crazy
",2018-04-13 00:00:00,3,"Poor poor film, too many bots giving 10/10 and a ""fantastic sci fi experience"" im not being paid so i can tell you its rubbish."
" Could've been a 9/10. But then there was endless preaching.
",2018-03-30 00:00:00,6,"In this movie the reason for the entire conflict remains in the dark until the very end, which is a very daring idea. I thought it was pulled off kinda nicely, although it did somewhat frustrate me, but not too much, because it helped me relate to the main protagonist. I thought that was neat.
The story was great, the character arcs were solid, the acting was decent, the visuals were good. The only thing I didn't like was that I was sometimes confused about why the focus was on this or that character. I got the impression that some quite important scenes got cut.At one point - I'm guessing 75-80% into the movie - I was prepared to give a 9/10 rating or even higher. This is very rare for me. I can probably count the movies that I rate higher than 8.5/10 on two hands.But then something terrible happened...
The preaching began. And it didn't end. It went on and on. It just didn't end. Even the final moments were all about the preaching. I got so annoyed that I started cursing.
So when I was done watching, my rating dropped a whole three points. You can probably tell, I don't like preachy movies. I don't like them at all. Can you tell? I bet you can tell.How could this awesome movie get screwed up so badly by unneccessary, relentless, unbearable preaching? Who made this terrible decision?
So close. So damn close. I'm so unbelievably disappointed. It could've been one of my all-time favorite movies, it had everything. But they just had to mess it up. They just couldn't help themselves..."
" You kinda have to be my age to appreciate it's mystical megnetism...
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,7,"This movie is done in a style that literally doesn't exist anymore in movies...the style takes you back to a time that was ""magical"", to when Disneyland was brand new, and Disneyworld Orlando was in construction...Tomorrowland is not just scifi, it is the magic of what our futures can hold.Never mind that the movie itself is a bit choppy in presentation, with a story line that is, frankly, hard to follow at times. Crazy as the story may seem at times, it always keeps you wondering what's next..."
" I Was So Excited! And Then...
",2018-03-08 00:00:00,1,"My father was an aerospace engineer for NASA, in New Orleans in the 1960s. You can see why I was so excited to see this film. Finally, I thought, all of our hopes and dreams for the Space Age put into a film capsule, all of the ideas--even the classic jet pack! Then, CGI took over, and Hollywood's new penchant for shocking the viewer with POV character tumbles and other violence that would leave a normal human being incapacitated--if not altogether decapitated. Long story short, after my father lied to my mother and us children and said he had been laid off from NASA instead of taking his promotion in Seattle, which was the truth, I began to hate Science and Sci-Fi--a hatred that grew inside of me year by year. But, I always held a soft spot for Ray Bradbury's imagination, and this film looked like it would bring all of the disparate ideas and concepts together--and with a precocious lad and cute girl to boot. How could we miss? But, we did. Will Disney try again? I hope not. They get progressively worse as the years and decades go by. In any case, unless you thrive only on wild color and swiftly moving cameras jerking this way and that, skip this one. It promises so much, but it never delivers. I'd be willing to bet Ron Howard could do far better with the Space Age. Agree?"
" Either I am slow or just disconnected but after five viewings
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,10,"To have ridden that amusement ride at Disneyland and to have attended the 1964 World's Fair should have spoken to my sentiments, but not until I saw dreamers through this lens did this story connect for me. Maybe they can create a TV show at Disney about this story."
" Had potential, but ended up disappointing.
",2018-01-24 00:00:00,6,"The trailers looked cool... but it turned out a very different story. I was expecting a cool sci-fi adventure of amazing innovation, etc. Instead it felt to me like just propaganda, promoting Disney and preaching their opinions.The main character felt shallow, claimed to be smart but sure didn't act smart. It was disappointing how often they had her just acting in dumb slapstick comedy styles. She seemed to just act on how she felt in a very impulsive manner rather than actually reasoning, in standard Disney hypocrisy, claiming to be empowering girls but still belittling them in how they cast them.They entire time they're pushing how terrible and mindless humanity is, and how we're going to destroy ourselves so nothing matters anyway. I can't call a movie hopeful or uplifting when it spends the entire time being negative then has a brief positive message at the end.Also, how is taking all the most innovative citizens to live in a different world going to help save Earth? Doesn't the world kind of need those people to help it rather than just sending them to live in a mini-utopia if they're privileged enough?The last straw for me was the the 50 year old guy being in love with a 10 year old girl... but shes a robot so it's okay...? Or just creepy...It was close to being an awesome movie for me, but after watching it I can see why it fell flat. If the main character had a little less blind passion and a little more intelligence and they spent less time preaching I probably would have liked it."
" A very good imaginative movie - makes one think!
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,9,"As a previous poster mentioned, you must consider who this movie is aimed at - probably at a teenage audience, and its goal seems to be to entertain, but also to make one question, and to think - I felt the acting was great, the scenes were great - the main reason I didn't give it a ten, but a nine - was because of the brief sermon about the religion of today - global warming, climate change, melting icebergs, crap that relies on computer models that have been wrong again and again. Overall, a great inspiring movie - with some good comedic moments -"
" A thoroughly enjoyable movie :)
",2017-12-01 00:00:00,8,"No doubt this movie has a political statement to make. But it's completely honest about it. Very refreshing, even if you agree, or not, with its mission.Technically the movie is where you would expect a modern day blockbuster to be. Good image, good sound, no goofs. Well made in every way.Acting is really good. The casting is spot on. The flow is good, so even though the movie may appear to be long, with a 130 minute run-time, it never feels like it's dragging along.The level of fun and action, AND seriousness, is pretty well balanced. It's a feel-good mood film, that does actually allow some drama to enter at just the perfect dosage (So it's not overdone and becomes cliché-like, but is all the more effective)It did remind me a bit of Cameron's The Abyss (Another cool movie)It made me laugh (I'm just going to say CocaCola, been there done that LOL) It made me cry (Who knew you could miss ones and zeros, but this film makes it possible)If you prefer dark themes (Like that of the low-budget crime-shows all the cheap TV-channels show 24/7) you'll not like this film. If you're not a fan of the super-hero hype, all the Marvel stuff, then you're in luck; this movie doesn't have those (But if you ARE a fan, then you still won't go home completely empty-handed; there ARE scenes that will appeal to you even if they aren't exactly like iron-man) If you like the 60s, you're in luck. If you like scifi, you're in luck. If you like 'normal' life-styles, you're in luck. If you like Paris, you're in luck. The list is long :)A thoroughly enjoyable movie. No less."
" ""We all live in future world""
",2017-11-08 00:00:00,7,"RELEASED IN 2015 and directed by Brad Bird, ""Tomorrowland"" is a sci-fi/adventure starring Britt Robertson as a smart, positive teen teeming with scientific interest and George Clooney as a former kid-genius now disillusioned. In order to prevent the end of the world, they team-up with a curious girl (Raffey Cassidy) on a mission to return to ""Tomorrowland,"" a futuristic world on a parallel plane. Hugh Laurie plays the political leader in Tomorrowland.This is a Disney production that cost a whopping $190 million with another $140 million tacked on for marketing. While it brought in a respectable $209.2 million worldwide ($93.4 million in North America), it was considered a disappointment due to its high cost.""Tomorrowland"" is a fun, compelling fable or a fairy tale about what happened to our positive outlook of the future and how can we get it back. To be expected by the presence of a teen and a girl as the protagonists, the target audience seems to be pubescents and adolescents, but there's just as much for adults to enjoy with Clooney and Laurie, not to mention elements of Star Trek (the future, androids, robots, etc.) and the Terminator films (ditto). There are several thrilling action sequences with the unexpected one in the shop being my favorite.The opening is a little convoluted and the action sequence with the boy, his jet-pack and the robots in Tomorrowland takes you out of the realm of quasi-realism and into cartoonish fantasy. This turned me off and I was tempted to tune out but, thankfully, the tone quickly turned more reasonable and the story perked up with the focus on Casey (Robertson) and Athena (the girl). The ending, while drawn out, conveys a positive message.THE MOVIE RUNS 130 minutes and was shot in Enderby, Vancouver & Surrey, British Columbia. WRITERS: Damon Lindelof & Brad Bird.GRADE: B+"
" Disappointing
",2017-10-30 00:00:00,6,"So much potential - what a disappointment. It was like watching an over-rehearsed play Or an episode of ""Hannah Montana"". Even Miley Cyrus bailed on that show. The future scenes were htonderful but ioo brief. I haven't seen a George Clooney film I liked - why do people think this guy can act? He just talks angrily through his roles, as if he was woken up from a nap, before his scene. WisdomsHammer gave an astute analyses on this movie's short comings. And Remco de Groot summarized it well ""Most of the time the movie gave the vibe of one of those promo films that are often run while you are waiting in line of a amusement park attraction. We were waiting for the doors to swing open and to be instructed to enter the trolleys and fasten seat-belts. Pins are for sale for $3.75 at the exit.""Actually a pin would be cool - I'd rather have one than endured this disappointment. Ending on a positive note, as mentioned by others, the actress playing Athena was splendid."
" A slide into unpleasantland
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,2,"I was initially OK with this. I initially liked that there were female leads. My first discomfort was not for me but for kids. There were needless killings of humans and dismemberment of robots. It seemed like it would be disturbing to small children. Also, the parts with kids steeling things seemed out of place for kids. It really took a dive when it began using time travel as part of the plot. From there on, the ""sci-fi"" ideas in the movie were in a downward spiral. Some social ideas presented in the movie had merit but were completely cancelled out by the low quality sci-fi story elements.Two areas which I want to emphatically state that I believe are overused. One is time travel. It often seems like a cheap plot device used to skip segments of story. And it's a sketchy concept often portrayed in silly ways. All that is in play in this movie. The other thing is the misuse of historical characters. This is especially bad in kids movies who may not ever get a real sense of the people portrayed in false ways."
" Reading between the lines
",2017-10-12 00:00:00,10,"Yes this movie has many points to point out that would make it an amazingly funny, cute and upbeat Disney movie. But my soul reason why I loved it, and gave it a 10 is the point. The reading between the line. The bases for the whole movie... for humanity to WAKE UP, our world is dying and we aren't doing anything about it. That one point in the movie were Nix explains the monitor... was the most revolutionary part in the whole movie. Brought tears to my eyes as I reflected on what he was saying and compared it to what is going on in the world. I need the writers of this movie to know... it has touched me. Thank you."
" A juvenile tale of optimism
",2017-10-11 00:00:00,5,"I expected way better from Disney and the actors that took part in the movie. I cannot complain about having seen it, in the end I enjoyed watching it but it does take too much time for the story to pick up; it takes too many puzzling steps that don't really add up, and when one gets the feeling that if someone erased the first half of the movie it would still make sense (or would make it a better one) it means that this isn't a great movie and it will be forgotten rather quickly.5 out of 10"
" Changing the world
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,10,"Please watch this movie, it has been given bad reviews unfairly, it warns people about our dying world but it does it in an entertaining way. When the world is doomed, what do you do? You'd try to alert people so they could take action to prevent the death of the world from happening, right? And how would you do it? With news stories? Scientific data? Good luck. Most people would rather turn a blind eye to any environmental issues and just watch Walking Dead reruns to get their minds off it.But what if there was a movie that was family friendly, had a great cast, and even had the Disney name attached to it? What if Hugh Laurie had a remarkable and compelling speech which tried to get the message out to as many people as possible to get their acts together? To save civilization, the movie would show it's collapse.But how do you think this movie was received? The ticket sales were lackluster, because everyone would rather watch the same kind of movie they'd seen a hundred times before. People didn't care to see something original, they wrote it off BECAUSE it was original! Critics, internet reviewers, right-wing conservatives, all defecated upon this movie, and told people it was a waste of time.Meanwhile, the movie was actually a hidden gem. An entertaining film with a powerful message, but nobody cared to see it! And because nobody wanted to watch it, the message went unheard by so many. In every moment, there is the possibility of a better future, where people get off their lazy asses and actually take action to improve something! Learning a new skill, planting trees to make the air cleaner, spending time with their families, inventing new technology!But people would rather resign themselves to a boring future where they never do anything of value for one reason: Because it's easier. The future where we've solved world hunger, ended prejudice, and achieved world peace is hard. Achievable, but hard. And the future where everyone is a lazy glutton that does nothing but eat pizza and watch TV all day is easy.So yes. We saw there was a problem, and we tried to warn people. But they just ignored this warning like all the others. Why? Because they want to be lazy. They gave up.And it's not the movie's fault if it's not striking a cord with you, it's yours."
" Believe the bad reviews
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,2,"Believe the bad reviews, and don't be misled by starry-eyed and wishful reviews. This film could not possibly be any clunkier and over-the-top convoluted melodrama, and Walt Disney himself would have shuddered at the outrageously ridiculous and twisted plot. No spoilers here, simply a warning: this movie is more pretentious, contrived and far-fetched than Oliver Stone's mildly entertaining movie ""JFK"", to which this movie is similar in trying to wrangle as many out-there and somewhat hair-brained theories as possible of a future world, including at it's core a conspiracy theory. George Clooney cannot save this disaster of an intelligent or articulate sic-fi fantasy, but the naive and confused might be drawn into thinking this is somehow, some way a meaningful or good movie. And did I mention that it is laboriously, almost painfully to long? Or, as a Disney movie, too graphically violent for kids...even though Tomorrowland at Disneyland was always intended as, and still remains, friendly to youngsters? Yech! Which rhymes perfectly with what this movie is: Dreck."
" Three-fifths of a good movie
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,4,"This film starts out exciting, with a young woman slowly discovering a mysterious world that exists in another dimension, but you can almost see the point at which the writers started quarreling about which direction to take the story. For some reason they get in a ball that transports them to the Eiffel tower, and then it's another trip in a rocket into outer space and then back to earth, and then there is endless monologuing and gibberish at yet another portal back to earth...it goes on and on like this, save the whales, global thermonuclear war, the girl's childhood home is flooded; if only she can prevent the future by destroying some hackneyed, thrown-together sci-fi phenomenon that somehow powers Tomorrowland. None of it makes any sense. Why even have the pin? The robots break their necks trying to kill Clooney & company, but once they arrive in Tomorrowland, Hugh Laurie decides to safely return them to earth...why not just kill them like the robots were trying to do all along? Hard to see this as a family film, several people are violently killed, and the product placement doesn't even try to be subtle. Glad I didn't pay to see this in a theater."
" Interesting
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,9,I only have one small complaint about the movie really. Are the Dreamers coming to Tomorrowland to create the future for Earth or for Tomorrowland? Frank stayed at Tomorrowland nearly 20 years but It didn't look like any or the innovations that were at Tomorrowland when he arrived in 1964 ever made their way to Earth. Or maybe I am reading too much into it.
" I can't hate this movie...
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,7,"Look, I know a lot of stuff about this movie doesn't work. It can be tonally awkward, the pacing near the end gets really slow and the dialogue can get a little weird. But... doggonit, I can't hate this movie! It's just so optimistic and fun that I can sort of look past even the parts that it doesn't do well. Give this one a chance and at least watch it once."
" An unexploited fantastic world
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,7,"A curious science-passionate girl receives a special badge which gives her the ability to enter a trans-dimensional world, but for a limited time. Thus, she meets an exiled inventor which will guide her to that world which seems to have many problems of its own.It's a very interesting idea which attracted me from the beginning, but, as it happens with many movies of this kind, soon fades away due to bad implementation or exploitation. They, for some unknown reason, decided not to focus so much on the fantastic world which had a lot to tell and instead presented in detail the life of an annoying young girl and her forced attempt to enter the fantasy world. As I said, intended or not, her character is very rebel and annoying, asks a lot of stupid and useless questions, contrary to what you would expect from someone passionate for science, while having a lot of attitude issues which simply end up on your nerves. Clooney's character isn't far from hers but is on a much lower lever, managing to be even funny at times. The plot is very linear, without any twist, predictable and with a sudden happy ending which is far from satisfactory.I don't understand why they decided to present it this way, when they had a huge new world which could have kept the viewer amazed and entertained for a long time, especially with its raise and fall, not to mention the amazing animations and details. It had so much potential, but somehow managed to make it almost dull."
" Completely Underrated!
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,10,"This movie is one of my all time favorites! This highly underrated movie is incredibly well balanced in story and action, and somehow manages to be funny at times. You will find yourself inspired at times and wondering why we cannot accomplish the monumental tasks similar to landing on the moon during mid-20th century, especially given advancements in our current digital age. A testament to Disney's vision of an advanced Utopian future, I would highly recommend this story for those individuals who want go on a roller coaster ride. I would also highly recommend this movie to those individuals with children. Some might warn against this, but I say it is an welcomed change to the traditional diatribe of reboots, remakes, and violent garbage offered now days."
" Incredibly Bad, Shallow Mess Of All Genres
",2017-05-31 00:00:00,2,"Are you being serious, guys - this is a Disney movie? This awful mess of mish mash of nonsensical mess of a whole array of genres that do not mix, do not get along and do not make any plausible sense whatsoever. This is not a family movie due to a real plenty of terribly violence and bloody mess. This is not a sci-fi flick due to a preachy tone and candy-floss sweetly-sweetly approach. This is a real bastard of a movie with all the wrong elements thrown together to cook a very unstasty vapid brew that looks sweet but tastes sour and dated. George Clooney is OK, as well as Hugh Laurie, bit of it, but never further than plain average. Younger actors are plain generic and bland. This is a strange weird mixture of genres which do not go well together in any proportions and thus create a strangely looking fruit which only seems attractive, because the final is terribly shallow and utterly disappointing."
" Come all ye dreamers
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,7,"This movie is hard to rate. It is full of drawbacks as well as wonders. There'll be some spoilersFirst -the wonders. Always good to see Hugh Laurie, especially in his House MD style) Charming fellow, Hugh Laurie, lights up every movie he's in. Athena is also very bright and brings the famous AI theme into the movie. Some Terminator II inspired scenes, namely the car chase, Spielberg-like AI dramatic finale - the finale was very touching, although I would prefer her to stay with the team. All interesting and strong scenes are actually the second part of the screen time so if you give it a chance, it goes better with every minute, and the last 20 minutes are particularly good.And the drawbacks... Britt Robertson screams a lot. Starting with an independent headstrong rebel clad in leather on a motorbike - sexy style) She was made into somewhat too hysterical then, Rebel turned into the kid in distress? Not a good idea. Retro scenes were too cartoonish and candy-like. The grandeur of the City of Science was completely undeveloped - the only ideas were flying trains and multi-storey swimming pools. Overall the movie had sort of a personality disorder, trying to be kids movie and a sci-fi drama. Yet it developed into quite an interesting show with the deep meaning underneath - which reminds me of earlier Disney movies of 80s and 90s. Good Disney movie definitely worth of watching) Feed the right wolf, as they've used to say in it))"
" Not what I'd call an E-ticket ride
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,4,"If Disney ever gets around to adapting Frontierland or the Tea Cups, hopefully they'll have a decent story to go with it. That's exactly the problem with ""Tomorrowland"". From the very first scene with Clooney's caustic intro, questions are raised, and more questions (and some buildup thrown in for good measure), but we don't actually get to Tomorrowland until a good 90 minutes in; and even then, it's just to set us down and deliver the film's moral (my god is it heavy-handed). It's that tiresome ""mystery box"" screen writing that's the biggest pain. No one can deny this movie looks expensive, but it's also bloated and preachy to excess.The thing that really bothered me is that (despite the name listed as director) it doesn't feel at all like a Brad Bird movie.And that is a crime.4/10"
" Slow, Boring
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,5,"Maybe good for kids, with a 2-hour attention span.I downloaded this a year ago & put it on a backlist.No real plot or attention-getting.Makes no sense.Seems like propaganda for greenism stuff, which is anti-human. Without non-""green"" tech the world would be so far behind, so poor.Energy & tech happens with using fossil fuels. Even the potential replacements: ethanol (burning food), solar, wind & falling water (dams) take fossil fuels to make. There's more to this movie, but I didn't get it. Dream on dreamers.The biggest thing I like is when Clooney destroyed the whole. Didn't happen -- kidding."
" Not as bad as they say.
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,9,"Raging against this film has become the new thing. Frankly the movie is entertaining. I know, I know, we all wanted to see more of Tomorrowland. I feel you. But just because the film was not what you expected it to be doesn't mean it was the worst film ever made. The acting is good, the story is a told well and original, not a reboot. The special effects are good and blah blah blah. I'm not saying it is the greatest movie ever made or anything like that, you know what I'm saying. It is a fun film with great visuals, so stop hating so hard. This is a seven out of ten kind of deal but I'm going to round up to nine just to offset some of the hate."
" Entertaining and fascinating but has some problems
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"Who didn't have a fantasy about a place like Tomorrowland as a kid ? I know I did and for that reason this film was fun to watch and was entertaining. However, I had to overlook a few things to make it so. One glaring issue to me was Britt Robertson. Her character reminded me of when I watched The 70's show on TV and anytime the actress playing Donna made an appearance, I would say to myself ""she not a high school student, she's a college girl"". And so, the same was for Britt. She does not look like a teenager in this at all even though she plays one. BUT, I was able to suspend my disbelief to get through a very good performance and a happy story. The other thing that played a role in all this is George Clooney who makes no secret of his political views. I enjoyed his performance a lot and I believe he was cast perfectly for this role BUT I was sure that there was a ""message"" that this movie had since he was in it. There it was toward the end of the film - the same bs we keep hearing from the Lamestream Media and the presstitutes they employ. Finally, as another reviewer pointed out, once again parents and adults are portrayed as less intelligent than teenagers. This is a continuing trend in entertainment that began a long time ago. It has become so prevalent that one can easily overlook that fact when watching product made in Hollywood. Aside from these observations, the movie was paced well, had some great special effects, catered to my childhood dream of a fantastic world that was possible and did not have gratuitous sex or violence."
" Timely
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,8,"Given recent social media and news reports about the state of our nation, I found ""Tomorrowland"" not only timely but very positive.Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is a brilliant, inquisitive young girl who wants to travel in space. She's discouraged by her dad, a NASA worker, because NASA is closing. When she climbs a few fences and makes her way into the Cape Canaveral Launch Center to sabotage equipment and keep it from closing, she's arrested.Upon the return of her personal effects, Casey finds a pin that isn't hers. She touches it, and suddenly, she's in a city of the future. This leads her on quite an adventure, which includes meeting a robot, Athena (Raffey Cassidy), who thinks Casey can help save the future. She brings Casey to meet Frank Walker (George Clooney), who has given up his life's project. As a former child inventor, he had worked to learn the secrets of a place somewhere in time and space that exists in collective memory.I hate to say it but I think this film was maybe too esoteric for the special effects audience. This is a version in a way of Ayn Rand's ""Atlas Shrugged"" and also deals with quantum physics. Wonderful, fascinating movie, with incredible special effects and yes, the theme of optimism versus pessimism, summed up in a speech by Nix (Hugh Laurie) that you could read anywhere today. And the message is clear: If you buy into a bad future, you can't change it."
" Visually stunning retro sci-fi
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,8,"In an age of dark, grim visions of the future Disney's Tomorrowland is a delightful throwback to upbeat adventures of the 60s and 80s, a retro sci-fi film for the whole family to enjoy.Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is a bright and optimistic high school student who does not share the pessimistic views of elders. When Casey discovers a mysterious pin that shows her fantastic world and sets out to find the futuristic city with the help of a jaded inventor, Frank Walker (George Clooney) and Athena (Raffey Cassidy), an English-accented Audio-Animatronics.Tomorrowland is a deliberately old-fashioned film both its tone and visuals: the film was loosely based on the Disney ride of the same name - considering that Disney were able to turn Pirates of the Caribbean into a billion dollar film series. Bird was a wise choice to direct and co-write, The Incredibles had a 60s style sci-fi look to it and he brought that look to Tomorrowland. It was bright and colourful with its showing of various technologies, from robots, jetpacks, lasers and a steampunk rocket.Brad Bird has already shown himself to be a capable action director with Mission Impossible: Ghost Portrayal and with Tomorrowland he had much better CGI. There are some cool fight sequences, especially with Athena - it is awesome to see a little girl beating up fully grown men and giant robots. Tomorrowland is visually spectacular especially when we get to see the city in all its glory for the first time. Bird certainly brought out a sense of awe, whimsy and wonder.Tomorrowland also has a great trio in the leads: Clooney, Robertson and Cassidy are terrific together, having many witty moments together when they are travelling and there is a zip in their interactions, like when they use a knock-out tool. Although Robertson's look too old to be a high schooler she pushes off the necessary enthusiasm. But it was Cassidy who stole the show: she was a revelation as Athena, playing a character who was older than she actually looked and at times acts a Terminator. She personally reminded me of Saoirse Ronan when she was younger, just with dark hair.Although Tomorrowland had a talented director at the helm it also had a screenplay with Damon Lindelof's fingerprints, a man who has poor reputation as a screenwriter. As an adventure Tomorrowland is excellent but when it goes to the science fiction the film gets bogged down with mumbo-jumbo about time particles and destiny. This part needed to be expanded and more refined. When it's revealed that Tomorrowland was a place for exceptional people to come to where they would not disrupted by government or civil society. Essentially this is similar to Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, a controversial sci-fi work that abdicates the philosophy of Objectivism, or if you prefer it's the ideology of Andrew Ryan in Bioshock. The prologue at the 1964 World's Fair could have been cut and it would have made the reveals more impactful.Tomorrowland is a good of romp of a film, providing plenty of laughs, action and visual spectcle. It was rated a 12A in the UK but it is on lower scale of that rating and could easily be enjoyed by children younger than that age."
" A rather misunderstood movie
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,9,"I expected a movie by Disney to be one of spectacular design and appeal to viewers of all ages. Well in a way they did appeal to a certain group of people.... just not to the masses that watch the typical Disney film and milk as much money as they can from it. I would call this the successor to Tron (1982) in the graphical sense. It will eventually become a cult classic in oh say 30 years or so and maybe by then we can look back and say hey maybe the movie wasn't so bad or for all we know, we may have flying cars and floating swimming pools and unlimited energy by then.... Who knows?My hat is off for Brad Bird's extraordinary work of creating a world of which the best minds of our time set aside politics and their differences to make a better world for themselves and humanity. Come think of it, it isn't that hard to believe that such a feat is possible but hey we live in a world where we have poverty and obesity at the same time so I'm not sure where we stand yet.The world Brad created was indeed convincing to me (I convinced some of my friends that the events were real by Disney's marketing then showed them the movie and laughing my ass off). The problem this had was poor storytelling. The graphics are on point and I expect nothing less from a Disney film but the story well felt hollow and is like a prequel to something greater. Of which I want to point out that if the book that came out with the movie plot was used instead, man I would expect a sequel in development right now. So yes and no, the world created is good, CGI is amazing, the cast is perfect but story? Its missing something vital. I'll see you guys in 30 years or so when Disney quits playing safe and get out of the money pool they are in and once again experiment with movies that explore our future instead of dwelling on the past"
" Family movie that hits the right spot.
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,7,Terrific and well cast. Good family movie as profanity free..! Engaging and entertaining great special effects and a real surprise find. Slick action and fast paced it tells a story that you can only enjoy from the onset.(spoiler alert) Hugh Laurie pulls it off as the villain of the piece. Mr Clooney smooth as ever with just enough gusto not to steal the show but draw you in nether less. Lots to like not much to dislike.A well rounded movie.
" underrated! Entertaining and thought provoking.
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,10,"I couldn't agree more with the users stating that Tomorrowland is hugely underrated. 10 out of 10 is probably a bit high but I simply want to react to negative ratings. Yes, the film follows some of the well known blockbuster paths and yes, there might be better films out there. But: Surely a fantastic cast, great laughs, exciting, bursting with ideas, and, this is the reason for my judgment, a brilliant reflection on social media and the negative hypes it creates in this world. I am not techno- or media-phobic in any way but the true sense of the film just hits the nail on its head regarding how media content affects what people think. I guess it should remind us of the thought that communication might be about saying what we think but it is equally important to remember that our thinking is being shaped by what we say and is being said. Especially out there on FB, Instagram and all these other channels where paranoid and negative scare- and warmongers want to take over control. I'd say, com'on boys and girls: let's feed the optimistic wolf, everyone. Entertaining and thought provoking!"
" Great Adventure Piece Filled With Interesting Themes
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"When I first saw the trailer for ""Tomorrowland"", I was intrigued by the mysterious premise and the promise of adventure. It delivered on both accounts.For a basic plot summary, ""Tomorrowland"" tells the story of a number of different individuals who are introduced to the alternative-universe of Tomorrowland. A young Frank Walker (Thomas Robinson) just wants to be an inventor, and he is ushered into the strange new world by Athena (Raffey Cassidy). It seems like he has is entire, exciting life as an inventor planned out for him. Fast-forward a number of years and Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is feeling stifled by a family life and school life that isn't challenging her enough. She stumbles across a pin that, when touched, transports her to Tomorrowland for short periods. Intrigued, Casey begins to investigate further, coming into contact with Athena herself and a sour, cynical, grown-up Frank (George Clooney). Casey and the gang are pursued by some shady forces too, proving that perhaps Tomorrowland isn't quite as angelic or benevolent as it may seem.The strongest facet of this film is that it simply is a great adventure piece. The characters are interesting enough to make you care, the visuals are spectacular (I'd recommend IMAX, as it truly was stunning), and the pacing is perfect. It's been quite some time since I've enjoyed a rollicking adventure like this without rolling my eyes.Another strong suit to ""Tomorrowland"" is that it contains enough futuristic themes to hook in more sophisticated viewers. Yes, it is made by Disney, and no, there isn't any questionable content, but this isn't a ""kids movie"" because, in all honesty, it deals with many of the same themes that ""Interstellar"" covered in its own more adult way. Simply put, ""Tomorrowland"" is the type of movie that an entire family can enjoy. It has adventure, humor, drama, interesting themes, and likable characters.The bottom line on this flick is that it is just great, entertaining cinema fun. Yet, it isn't ""mindless fun"" by a long shot, as the themes explored are ones that people of all ages can relate to. Highly recommended in all formats and for all cinema-goers."
" 'Tomorrowland' is a fun and entertaining fantasy-flick!
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,7,"I don't get all the negative reviews this film has garnered. I found it to be a very entertaining movie with INCREDIBLE special effects. Quite frankly, if Walt Disney Pictures had produced Ayn Rand's 'Atlas Shrugged', I would have expected to see a film similar to this one. As well, there were a lot of social implications addressed in this movie.Aside from the typical good vs. evil and super heroes vs. villains we see in a lot films these days, 'Tomorrowland' addressed that there would BE no tomorrow unless certain things change now ~ that these exciting inventions and scenarios we saw in the film might not take place unless significant things are altered that are occurring in our world today, i.e., war, global warming, poverty, etc. It didn't hurt that two of my favorite actors were in this movie ~ George Clooney and Hugh Laurie...who, incidentally, are both strong advocates for social change so it's no surprise they were involved with this film. Putting those things aside, 'Tomorrowland' turned out to be a very enjoyable break from ordinary, repetitive sci-fi flicks, and a great way to spend two hours! 7* out of 10."
" Well financed but save your finances...
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,2,"The movie in a nutshell: parents and adults are stupid and clueless, while the kids are bright, intelligent and oh, so enlightened when it comes to technology and saving the planet! Get the picture? Fair acting, well financed, effects are cool, but obviously a ""Disney"" film advertised as ""for kids"" but just more of the same ""save the planet"" left wing rhetoric that has come to represent most Hollywood drivel today. Even breaking and entering is presented as holy and justified if the means are to delay that evil, capitalistic progress! Aren't kids preached to enough in schools about how there is no God and it is all up to us to save the world? Trust me on this one, save your bread!"
" Captivating film
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"I'll keep this relatively short. I'm a 60 year old, very hard to please Brit. This film, pleased me very much indeed. Hence, the 9 out of 10 score. Those who marked this film down, really do require a reality check. I'm not usually given to writing film reviews, but on seeing this film's current low rating - I felt compelled to write something positive, in its favour. The acting and special effects alone, stand on their own. The film, may well be 105 minutes long, but it's 105 of the best spent minutes I've had, this millennium. I won't delve into the film's storyline, as that has been adequately explained by others. If you want to be engagingly captivated, in a futuristic, make-believe World - where anything seems possible - then this is the film for you. I for one, would love to escape the current mess of a World we live in - to experience the alternative dimension, on offer, in Tomorrowland: A World Beyond"
" This movie didn't work for me, at all
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,5,"Tomorrowland is the second live action feature by Brad Bird after his successful debut with Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. The movie follows Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) who tries to enter a new, mysterious world with the help of inventor Frank Walker (George Clooney). The overall marketing campaign behind the movie was quite mysterious about the plot of the movie, which is a good and rare thing these days. Lately, you don't get to see a movie very often without knowing what it's about. Unfortunately, figuring out what the movie was about during watching it was perhaps the sole aspect of the movie that kept me interested. This Disney family movie didn't work for me, at all. Tomorrowland sets up and explores a new, original world and luckily the visuals were good enough to make this world look appealing. This should have been beneficial to my interest in this world, but almost every aspect of the movie, besides the visuals, made sure that I wouldn't get invested in the movie. Alright, it's a kid's movie and therefore the acting is sometimes silly because that's how kids like it. The dialogue is simple and very expositional, so kids can understand the movie. But that's no excuse for the dialogue to be this awful and the acting to be this bad. You can make things simple without making the bad. Take 'Back to the Future' for example, where the dialogue and acting are quite silly, but unlike in 'Tomorrowland', it actually works. In the case of 'Back to the Future', director Robert Zemeckis and actors Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd played a pivotal role in the success of the movie. It takes great actors with an understanding of comedy to deliver this kind of silly dialogue, and it takes a competent director to set the right tone for the movie to make this kind of acting and dialogue work. Brad Bird and Britt Robertson failed at what the cast of 'Back to the Future' succeeded. George Clooney gave a decent performance.Tomorrowland will not become a classic Family movie, but will be forgotten shortly after watching it. Which is a shame, because the movie did set up an original world."
" Disney Pixar Presents ""Tomorrowland""
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,6,"George Cluney agreed that this movie was considered a flop as it not make in royalties to cover the film's budget . The cast and crew were fabulous. Another Disney Pixar Epic adventure . Somehow the plot was lacking . And the Screenplay was not by Screen Gems. The director went to work as usual with what he had to work with in storytelling was missing something . Disney was over budget on a low budget film . Thank you SAG - AFTRA . Deserves a GP rating by the motion picture association of America. Filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada . The Scenery as well as the film's special effects are breathtaking. The film's director and Producer deserve a nomination for 2015 Best Film at the Oscars. As 2015 had quite a few memorable film's ."
