" A well-crafted story with a few flaws
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,6,"Initially, I was really impressed with this film. I found its story deeply compelling and I really liked the final act, in particular. While I still think it's a good movie, the more I thought about it, the less impressed I was with the whole affair.Before I get into my issues with the film though, I'll talk about what I liked, which was mainly the emotional core involving Sam. It's hard to discuss this aspect without spoiling it, but I really loved the way it developed throughout the film. Though you may dislike Sam, I did understand why he did what he was doing and I found the idea of him performing his son's music to help him cope with his death really compelling. Also, without spoiling anything, what you learn in the third act complicates your feelings on Sam even more. The significance of the film's title is that, just as a boat without a rudder drifts aimlessly without no clear purpose, the same could be said for Sam. After the opening, he has an unstable position of living in a boat and he plans to perform only one of Josh's songs, but after meeting Quentin, he spirals off from there, with his band obtaining more popularity around the city he lives in as the film goes on. Yet, in spite of all this, he still shows a lack of interest in expanding the band's popularity at times.There were also a couple minor things I enjoyed about this film. The first one was its portrayal of how Rudderless grew in popularity as the film went on. I generally like seeing artists grow in popularity and recognition in films and I think this movie gave a fine depiction of this. I also liked that Billy Crudup and Anton Yelchin were legitimately good singers as, nowadays, this can be hard to come by in Hollywood. Finally, I enjoyed some of the film's humor. Like, not all the humor worked (more on that in a bit), but I did appreciate the occasional humorous line or gag.With that being said, I think the main problem with this film was that there was too much going on in it. While I found the emotional core compelling, I wasn't so hot on the conflict between Sam and Alaird, the agent of the boat harbor. Within this sub-plot lied a few scenes where Sam urinated into the lake in public (sometimes to the view of children) and another scene where he endangered the lives of multiple people on the lake. These actions culminated with Alaird asking for him to stop and threatening to kick him off the lake. Though this sub-plot would've still been unnecessary, these scenes could've worked decently enough if the film had remained firmly on Alaird's side, but instead, these scenes came off as humorous and if the movie was trying to get us to sympathize with Sam. This sub-plot clashed poorly against the main conflict, which didn't ask for us to sympathize with Sam. As a result, this kind of muddled the film's message, in my opinion. I was also left confused by the conflict with Kate, Josh's ex-girlfriend. While I'm not sure the story would've been improved if she was in the film more, I did find it weird that Selena Gomez, the most well-known celebrity in the film, was cast in the role. Given how little she was in the film, her scenes felt like cameos.I was also surprised that Josh's music got as popular as it did. Like, don't get me wrong. I did like the music Rudderless performed, but Quentin and everybody else who listened to it reacted to the music as if it was one of the best things they ever listened to. I found this aspect kind of cheesy. To be honest though, I think it's really hard to get the ""character is a great artist"" premise to work. In Amadeus, for instance, this premise obviously worked given the source material. In World's Greatest Dad though, I had difficulties with believing that Lance's mediocre writing got as popular as it did. Really, if a film wants me to believe that a character is excellent at creating something (music, poetry, etc.) to the point that everybody appears to be blown away by it, their work better be that great for this premise to work. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case with this film.Overall, even though I have more bad than good to say about this film, I did enjoy it quite a bit. I think the emotional core of the film is strong enough to shine through the narrative issues (which are admittedly a lot) and, in the end, I came away satisfied with the film. I'm not sure if it's something I'll revisit, but I definitely enjoyed my time with it."
" Seeet, surprise, poignant
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,8,"Never heard of the film and just stumbled upon it while searching Amazon Prime. A real surprise. It's a wonderful little movie.
Crudup and Yelchin are outstanding. ( Crudup was familiar; Yelchin was new to me) The songs are excellent. Some holes in the screenplay could have been plugged, but that doesn't take away from the film's effectiveness. A shame Anton Yelchin does so young; he could have been a really interesting actor as he matured."
" A new perspective on the sorrows of death.
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,10,"Came across this beaut on Amazon browsing for a good watch. Without giving away too much. The synopsis for this movie really sets it up perfectly. The music is great and the overall acting, script and direction for the movie I thought were perfect. Definitely a change of perception than other movies. I love when a movie gives you a new perspective. I think this movie does that greatly. Its also not an easy watch for everyone. Also be aware it tackles a heavy subject but if you're a open minded movie. Grab some tissue and enjoy."
" Mixed feelings
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,7,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. On one hand I feel for those parents who lost their child to a college shooting, on the other hand, the emotions they deliver on the screen seem childish and egoistic. Then, after The Reveal, the whole plot dissolves into nothingness.
The acting is good, but I'm not sure Crudup, whom I respect immensely, is really fit for the part. We don't get enough of Felicity Huffman. Anton Yelchin is perfect. Selena Gomez? Meh...
All in all, in mho, a fairly good start for neo-director William H. Macy, who is yet to deliver his best work."
" Rudderless
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,6,"Rudderless is a dramatical comedy about a father's journey after a massive shooting involving his son. There's little to no comedy so calling this a comedy is a bit of a stretch. They just took an incredibly sad story and put it on screen but it doesn't work the same way. The music is somewhat good and my favorite part is near the end when he's singing at the bar, that was a good moment. It's an ok movie to watch."
" Shameless
",2020-01-07 00:00:00,1,"The first major clue that the viewer is in the clutches of manipulative, emotional morons, who assume the audience is as stupid as they are, is the scene where a supposedly devastated Sam (Billy Crudup) looks around his late eighteen year old son's room and we see the shelves stuffed with games, books and toys one would associate with a six-to-twelve year old. That indigestible bolus of phony pathos was so obvious that it telegraphed ""the kid is the shooter.""The suspicion was reinforced when Sam emerged from a liquor store with two un-bagged 1.75 liter bottles of hard booze, stumbled into his convertible and was accosted by a TV reporter. Sam, a real class act, responds to the young woman's question by calling her ""a heartless, bottom-feeding M- F-"" and this is really where the movie unmasks because this is not a story about the experience of the parent(s) of a teenage mass murderer.It is, despite a couple of obligatory demurs thrown in for show, the pathetic wet dream of a middle aged, suburban, professional mediocrity who fancies that regressing back into a particularly surly, crude, unpleasant, and fundamentally dishonest teenager is a really cool idea. (American Beauty (1999), a tepid, rather vacuous version of the better but somewhat confusing Appassionata (1974), looks like great art compared to this.)Two years pass. Sam is living on a small sailboat, on a small, polite lake, and habitually urinates in full view from the prow of his boat. When told by another denizen that his behavior is unacceptable, Sam responds with sarcasm and insult at the level of deliberately and repeatedly mispronouncing the man's name.Later, Sam is asked to move his boat for an upcoming regatta, agrees to do so, then doesn't. Later still, Sam is awakened by the passing regatta. Annoyed, he yells at it to shut up. When it doesn't, he pulls out his guitar, straps his amp to the front of the mast, ties his boat's wheel, (which incidentally means fixing the rudder's position), plays a screechy, obnoxious version of the overture to Rossini's opera William Tell in a sad, talentless imitation of Jimi Hendrix's poignant rendition of The Star Spangled Banner, and, with an elaborately raised middle finger, (reminding the viewer that they could be watching, or reading, Sometimes A Great Notion (1971) instead), sails into the middle of the regatta, colliding with other boats and knocking people into the water.Although his actions are childish, irresponsible and downright dangerous, the movie wants us to cheer Sam for sticking it to the uptight, straight world. How do we know this? Well, for instance, there are four confrontations between Sam and the fellow who asks Sam to not piss in the lake. In all of them the latter is made to look ridiculous in the most superficial manner possible.Examples: The character is classic ""nerd"" and dressed in ill-fitting, clown-like garments, such as urine-yellow slacks. In the first two encounters, he is in a tiny rowboat, (reminiscent of a miniscule clown car), wearing a greatly oversized, bright red, old-style life vest. In the third he is wearing an enormous bow tie of the type that was considered fashionable in men's formal attire of the 1970s. (This is not the only instance where the production is redolent with the odor of 1970s adolescence.)Yet we are expected to take this bilge seriously.(Instead of circulating a petition, I would simply have fired a distress rocket into the cabin of Sam's boat...preferably while he was in it.)The Plagiarist from Pill Hill music subplot is nothing more than a vehicle for a potent strain of narcissism. This is evident both in the music itself, (which is of the shallow, simplistic, derivative, whiny, self-absorbed variety that the Surgeon General warns can cause testicular retraction in male listeners), and in the reactions of the audience. Sam plays one song and is avidly pursued by a kid, (named Quentin -- shortened by Sam to ""Q"" to impress the chicks), who rhapsodizes until Sam agrees to join a garage band with some other kids.Sam fits right in with these young people less than half his age who are essentially his entire social nexus, but the movie, completely lacking a critical eye, plays this absurdity straight and without a trace of irony. One yearns for something less artificial...like The Partridge Family.Mom is just as bad. She has an 11-month, ""$200,000.00, miracle"" baby. Assuming a nominal 9 month gestation, this means she became pregnant, or hired a surrogate, 4 months after her son's murder spree and death. (There is here the core foundation of a story about a parent attempting to run from the events, (in fact, she accuses Sam of ""hiding out""), but this script either cannot recognize authenticity or treats ideas as things to be glimpsed but never touched.)Had the filmmakers anything of substance to offer, this could have been the drama of a man trying to reconstruct his son's life in an effort to understand why he did what he did, or something indicative of an acute, unique pain and confusion. But that requires a conscience. Instead, the closest we get is Sam and his ex-wife celebrating their dead son's 21st birthday by drinking tequila out of the bottle, cleaning graffiti off his massive headstone, and absolving each other of any responsibility whatsoever for their child's actions.Almost Famous (2000), another technically competent, awful, utterly juvenile movie starring Mr. Crudup, equated Peter Frampton with Eric Clapton, but Rudderless is completely compassless. Sam and his ex are the kind of parents whose son would willingly be complicit in a fraud to obtain admission to an institution he didn't rate on merit.Maybe that's why the kid blew a few gaskets and rocker-arms.And Mr. Macy, in his fern-barish club, looked just plain silly topped by a little round lid -- Edmond (2005) would not have approved -- but I've never seen an electric ukulele before.XYZ"
" Stay spoiler free!
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,10,I'm glad I wasn't spoiled on the twist. This movie stayed with me... actually I watched it quite a few years ago and it's still with me! It's fantastic!
" Hidden Gem of a Film - 8.6 <--- (specifically)
",2019-05-17 00:00:00,9,"This is one of those hidden gems that not nearly enough people will ever get to see....regrettably.Most of the reviews have covered all that can be said about the film and some are spot on. Those that didn't like it or were uber-critical of the film, probably either reek of the pretentious ilk, are ruled by a cynical or hardened heart, or lack the maturity necessary to appreciate it. I do understand it doesn't contain the easiest subject matter to initiate.As many have noted, it's an extremely provoking, deep, and emotional film. I'm so glad to see I'm not the only one to acknowledge William H Macy's talent both in front of and behind the camera.This movie will unfortunately be lost and forgotten among the big studio and blockbuster productions. I wish I could have persuaded more friends and associates to check it out. The truth is I although gravitate more toward the action, sci-fi, faster paced genres, I welcomed what this film delivered. Granted, I was a music ed major in college, I'm also a Marine Corps vet, adventure seeker type. This movie is refreshing, and without a doubt an awesome diversion from your typical high powered, big budget, endorphin-targeted feature films of today. I HIGHLY recommend it."
" Brave and Brilliant
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,8,"This is not a musical. This is about a father's unconditional love for his son, woven into the accidental creation of a briefly successful band whose songs are frankly unforgettable, and will stay ringing in your ears days after.
Crudup plays the completely believable bereaving father while Yelchin (God bless his passed soul) brings boyish charm and unforgettable music into a story that will both capture, repel and delight you.
It's been five years since this movie was released, but I still go back to it just to watch and listen to the fabulous songs. Especially the poignant last.
Watch this movie, because it's brave, brilliant, and it will affect you."
" The music is very good
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,7,"The music is very good. In fact, the story is very clever, is a rare entry point. From the point of view of the father of the shooting, we can see how the murderer's family should face life. It's just the design that the film reveals about the murder, some of which are abrupt, especially the tombstone. The paving in front of it is a little insufficient. In a short time, we have to account for the secular pressure, the struggle of the male lord, the contrast of the mother. At the end, we have to give a little understanding of the world. It is too hasty and the contrast is too strong, which causes the problem of tearing."
" This movie punched me in my face
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,10,... and then gently wiped away my tears. A brilliant film not to be missed.
" A film filled with emotion and unforgettable music!
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,9,"Before today I had sadly never heard of this movie. My dad was the one that recommended it for me and I am so delighted that he did. This movie is full with emotion; both heartwarming and heart-wrenching. I don't really want to spoil too much about the story, since I feel like it's a story best told by the movie itself. 
In short; the movie is about a father who looses his son in a school shooting and it shows his way of dealing with his terrible loss (through the music and songs left behind by his son).This movie is really great. It takes what is quite a familliar topic and makes something that I felt was just different and so, so special. The story is what really sells this movie, and it's brought to life by great directing from William H. Macy, great writing and splendid acting. Billy Crudup (who plays the father) gives a powerfull and real performance giving us a father who's trying to come to terms with his teribble loss. Another actor that gives a great performance is Anton Yelchin who sadly past away two years ago. I just wish he would have had longer, because he was so very talented. The music; which is a big part of the movie, is absolutely amazing and I love every single one of them. I've read that some people have found this movie a bit slow. which I don't agree with at all. The movie tells its story in a pace that perfectly fits the movie and I never during my time watching it got bored or uninterested. I was simply hooked.It's really sad seeing that this movie hasn't gotten a lot of recognition, because I think it is a really great piece of film and I very much recommend everyone to see it!"
" loved this movie
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,9,"William H Macy directing, Billy Crudup Anton Yelchin,Felicity Huffman?? Can't go wrong with any of them. It made me laugh cry,i was surprised angry AND absolutely in love with the originality of the story line and saw things from a different perspective. It wasn't just about 1 guy, one kid, one loss. It is really a great movie and I could and I have watched it once a month since I found this little gem last year. It truly is one of my favorite movies. If you get a chance to watch it, I highly recommend doing so. Loved it."
" A movie that will provoke us to think about consequence
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,9,"I must admit, I was planning to be on my cellphone while watching this but I decided that I had to pay tribute to the late Anton Yelchin. I was shockingly surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. Billy Crudup is good as he usually is but Yelchin was good, he made the movie more sincere I thought. Fishburne was a nice little addition to the cast that gave the movie a bit more star power.I say this is a movie to think about consequence but we never really understand what our actions will give birth to later on in our lives. We think that we are just living individually but this movie shows that what we do echoes on for a long time. The son's actions had a very big wave of consequence and this was felt throughout the movie by Crudup's character, you always got and uneasy feeling of restlessness from him and this is what made Crudup so good, he embodied what it would be like to be the father or someone who committed such a heinous act. If it was not for this he would not have found his love for music or the perspective it provided in a rough time of his life.This is not so much a review I know but if anyone is struggling with a life decision I think 'Rudderless' is a great movie to watch."
" This movie is a boat with a rudder being directed to a hopeful end.
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,8,"The movie starts out by introducing us to a young man, Josh, playing music in his college dorm. We are also introduced to the young man's father, Sam, sealing a deal at his business. We see Sam calling up his son so that they can meet up and celebrate his deal. It quickly takes a turn when we find out Josh did not make it to meet up with his father, and instead lost his life. Sam quickly finds out on the news at the bar he was waiting to meet at that his son died in a shooting at the school's library.Most of the movie takes places two years after Josh's death and centers around Sam and the aftermath of the tragedy. Sam receives his son's music from his ex-wife. He comes in contact with another side of his son in his music. He is consumed by this version of his son that has been overtaken by all the negative voices speaking of his son. This version is personified almost by this new young man that enters his life, Quentin, who loves the songs his son wrote. It's a troubled soul that is crying out for help in some of the songs I think. Pretty much everything about this movie is excellent. The songs are beautifully written, musically and lyrically. It gives you a unique perspective as the parent of a school shooter. The performances are superb. The cinematography is notable. Lawrence Fishburne is awesome.At the start of the last third of this movie, you are hit with ""the big twist"". His son was the bad guy. Most people don't see it coming. It's written exceptionally well, it really sets you up to believe that Josh was an innocent victim, but at the same time it lets you come to that assumption on your own. Having watched it multiple times, there are definitely some subtle hints that he was the shooter.This movie prompts discussion about a number of things, art, loss, grief, music, etc.. if you like talking about movies and the subjects they bring up with your movie watching partners, then this is a good one.The separation of art from it's artist is an example of one of the things we discussed. Would you listen to music or rock out to it at a show if you knew it was written by the Columbine shooter? Brock Turner? Hitler? John Wayne Gacy? No, probably not.It could be music about anything; a nice day at the park, a special happening, a blooming romance, but when it is revealed to you that it's creator has done terrible things, would you still listen? That's where the viewer finds himself in this movie. The son of the main character who wrote most of the songs that his dad plays shot and killed 6 students at his college. Even after the ""big reveal"" I think it makes you question whether or not it is okay that his music is shared with the world. Before you reveal, you're like, of course. It's cool that his dad is playing his songs! Why are they having a problem with this? It could be because he's gone and they aren't really his songs, but then again you're not sure.Ultimately, I think this movie is about healing. Healing through a devastating loss. The healing in this movie occurs with the aid of music and a few new relationships. He starts the sad descent into hopeless despair rudderless, but by the end of the movie, I believe he has found his course, his solace, his peace. He has made his impact. The truth has been revealed. Some healing has occurred."
" Don't miss this one.
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,10,"The write-up on this movie made it sound a little silly — after dad loses son, he starts a band. Wow, that doesn't begin to tell the depth of this movie. While the music was awesome and I was blown away by Anton Yelchin's singing, the story went totally where I didn't expect it to. I haven't seen a plot twist handled this well in years. Amazing directing job by Macy and fantastic performances by the entire cast. Billy Crudup is outstanding. I had never even heard of this movie. It came out in 2014. I'm sorry it didn't get more attention because it's really memorable and thought-provoking. I am so glad I found it. Well worth watching. Enjoy the music. Enjoy a great story for our times."
" What A Shocker
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,8,"I can identify with this movie from a musicians point of view. Open mike nights, discovering different people to be in bands. Age and gender does not really matter as far as the love of the music is concerned. Although there are players too old to be in a band with people so much younger from a career and touring point of view. The hunting for rehearsal space because of neighbor's complaints. The weeding through original songs that are sometimes awful and hard to hurt the writers feelings about their art. I liked the Rudderless band's punk rock cover of the kids song Wheels Of The Bus better than anything Josh wrote. His originals were of the whiny contemporary variety. I don't understand why his ex-girlfriend felt entitled to continue her destruction and try to ruin it for everyone.I almost turned this movie off at track 2 on the DVD because of the bad music and the lack of interesting character names, Sam/Josh. Glad I stayed for the emotional slam given on track 11. I did not see that coming. I have not seen any movies about mass shootings; victims, parents, perpetrators or anyone else involved. I have seen a couple of documentaries about medicated children (given because parents lacked discipline and guidance skills) where that is presented as a cause for the flip out. I couldn't understand the grief of the parents partially because they were affluent. Shame on me, grief doesn't know the difference between wealth and poverty. I now have a greater understanding and humility of both sides because of this film. It is many times better than Rikki And The Flash as far a fake band movies and their story lines go but Rikki's music was better. I rated it 8/10. Better music (to me) would have garnered it a 10/10."
" Loved it!
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,10,I only wanted to review this after reading the most recent reviews and it's regarding the music. For what this film is and the way it was made it was suited for more current band music based on the actors in the band and the older aged character that is in the band. They are trying to show the man reverting to drinking a large amount and how he cant cope (microwavable food)-in regards to the father showing no emotion. I see loads of emotion in this amazing performance. Basically anyone reading the most recent reviews disregard them please and watch this film. I have seen three times and think its simply stunning! It is such an unused concept mental illness and should be in many more films so it can be noticed. Everyone should have someone to talk to and i think this does a great deal in raising awareness to this terrible disease.
" ... a delicate tale about loss and the often very bumpy road to healing.
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"We've all experienced it... we see a good film but there are a couple of elements that seem out of place, or just kinda clunky in an otherwise very cogent effort... and there we are cheering it on... be great, we want you to be great... oh, don't do the obvious thing... don't go pedestrian on me! What could have been a four star movie we subconsciously demote. In the case of Rudderless, it teeters on the brink of a fall quite a few times, but in those moments when it finds its direction and steers straight, it shines brilliantly.Actor William H. Macy - has been entertaining us for decades in films like - Fargo, Pleasantville, Mystery Men and the US copy of the British TV series Shameless, very often providing a lift to an otherwise under performing movie. Here his role is small but he takes on a bigger task - lending a hand in polishing the script and directing the film.And there's a lot of responsibility on on his shoulders with this delicate tale about loss and the often very bumpy road to healing.Billy Crudup plays Sam, an advertising suit who clearly makes a lot of money helping other people in suits sell things to people who probably can't afford suits.He arranges to meet his amateur song writing College Student son to celebrate a big dollar deal but the son doesn't arrive.Dad's a bit annoyed but then discovers why Junior was a no show. The reason? A mass shooting on a College Campus.Cue Sam's not coping and ""downward spiraling life montage"" with too much drinking and kitchen sink full of dirty dishes... you get the idea... leads to Sam dropping out and living on a boat, not wearing suits and significantly lowering his personal grooming standards.To this point the film has felt pretty ordinary, in fact a tad clichéd, but Sam's rudderless existence is lifted out of tele movie of the week territory and into a very respectable, thoughtful, mid-shelf indi space.They say in classic story telling the hero has to reach his lowest point to be able to change... and the catalyst for Sam's change comes in the form of a box of demo recordings - songs made by his son.Sam begins playing some songs at a local bar's ""open mic night"" where he is spotted by a quiet young man, Quentin, played by Anton Yelchin. Quentin suggests Sam expands his solo act to a duo... and then even a little more. Why? He sees great value in the songs Sam is performing.I've read some comments that suggest Rudderless looses it's direction in the middle act but I disagree entirely - I find this middle act of the film the most engaging... And the most real... from the point Sam and Quentin meet I'm on a journey of discovery, totally in the moment, WITH these guys, transcending the earlier part of the film where I was just sort of passively observing and being fed the set-up.The developing relationship between the emotionally scattered Sam and the introspective Quentin is beautifully played. Yelchin, in particular, is an delight and we begin to see Crudup come into his stride as a caring side of Sam emerges and Quentin becomes, at times, a sort of surrogate son to Sam.The original songs are great (I had the soundtrack on my i-pod playing on loop for two weeks!). Tuneful with intelligent lyrics that cleverly relate to the developing character relationships... There are even a few hints about a big secret in the plot that you likely won't pick up on a first viewing, and that's fine, just go along for the ride, but a second time around you might spot the Easter eggs in the song lyrics.Just to clarify, it's not a musical where the characters spontaneously burst into song to express their thoughts and feelings, the songs are what the band performs, but having this additional layer of comment and insight, via the lyrics, gives the music a real purpose, operating on two levels.The fact that the band really are the guys you see on screen - that's them playing and singing - is a huge plus. I liked the music so much I wanted to find out where they were playing their next gig and get a prime spot in the mosh pit! Now, I did mention there were bumpy bits that, to me, diminished a potentially great film...=== SPOILERS AHEAD === My main disappointment is the character played by Selena Gomez. She pops up providing an information dump then disappears until her next scheduled information dump. I wanted to see the character integrated into the film rather than just appearing like the Ghost of Christmas Past to be an annoyance to Sam.The big ""ooh ahh"" reveal moment regarding the Son, is it all trick-or treat-a-bility and a little ingenuine? To be debated by those who have seen the film.Laurence Fishburne's character, the music shop owner, feels like a clumsy convenience for some green guitar plot developments that feel often perfunctory and mechanical.Then there's the ending, the, ""Lets wrap it all up in a visual montage where everyone gets what they want""... I was thinking, ""No, don't go there! This film is potentially much, much, better than a pat ending wrapped up in a cheesy bow!"" but you know what? It works really, really well and it's not an avalanche of cheap sentiment at all.By the end has Sam found his salvation through truth and music? How many steps closer is he to finding his very personal Nirvana?"
