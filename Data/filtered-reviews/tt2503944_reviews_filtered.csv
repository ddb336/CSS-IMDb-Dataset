One night, after 8, he decided to be REALLY.... heavy on the gravy with some of staff.... so...

" Idolizes abusive men
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,1,"The only thing that made this movie watchable was Daniel Br√ºhl. It glorifies Cooper's character and has the other characters cater to him and his tantrums and desires, but we don't understand why, because he treats everybody like garbage. The movie seems to be saying that as long as you're an okay-looking white dude, you can get away with behaving horribly as long as you do it under the guise of being ""passionate."" The storyline is implausible and feels like it was written by two fifteen year old boys about what they think it means to be an adult."
" Great story!
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,8,Well done and overall great story of the competitive restaurant industry.
" Cooper's a prick and we're meant to like it?
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,2,"This film had a wonderful cast, most of whom are wasted being mouthy cliches.
Maybe I'm just not posh enough or stuck up my own backside enough but I really struggle to see why I'm meant to be invested in a shouty jerk's journey to feeding ultra expensive plates to the posh. There is far too much cringeworthy dialogue about needing to be arrogant to work in my kitchen and food that makes you want to stop eating and blah blah blah. The scene where Bradley Cooper destroys and verbally abuses the entire kitchen before assaulting Sienna Miller is deeply uncomfortable on many levels. I don't understand how it's meant to be acceptable just because he's driven but has demons or whatever the excuse of the day is for men's behaviour.
With all that is negative about the film it is beautifully shot. One of the stars is for that. The other is for Daniel Bruhl's Tony, the best performance and only really likeable character in the film."
" People who are giving bad reviews are not from Industry
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,8,I know... I've been part of hospitality industry for so long and this movie is masterpiece... People who are enjoying coz there are too much cooking for them..... Trust me watch it
" Pee-yew.
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,2,"One ridiculous scene to the next.Well acted, except scenes where Bradley Cooper goes over the top.He would have gotten the crap knocked out of him first time he went off.Just preposterous."
" Extremely entertaining
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,8,"People say this movie is a predictable cookie cutter movie, that may be partly true, but I still felt this was a great movie. Acting on point, very unique setting of the upscale restaurant scene. Plot twists and tension throughout"
" Not real chef
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,1,"I have been working in the culinary area over 6 years in North America. I can say that maybe only 5% from the movie scenario can be true and can happen in the real kitchen.
To begin with, two very fake things are a behaviour of the chef and when cooks cleaning the kitchen after a shift. There is different type of employees like dishwashers, night cleaners who are doing this job. A real chef will NEVER EVER TOUCH anyone in the kitchen, especially female. It is a physical assault and he can be fired regardless his culinary reputation.
Also, it was funny when that young guy with a girl wake up and Cooper cooked Bouillabaisse and some meat for them :)
First of all, nobody cook food which served for dinner at the morning. And you need a lot of ingredients for a fish soup or Escargot, I don't think that you can find any of them in the home fridge. Also, chefs are tired of cooking and believe or not, don't cook at home. So it is stupid when you see a chef with Michelin stars meets with Bouillabaisse at the morning a young guy with his girlfriend.
Also, small things: You NEVER try how sharp is a chef's knife with your finger. If it is really sharp you can cut yourself right away. You NEVER use a metal fork to scramble eggs in the nonstick pan (it is suppose to be a wooden or plastic spatula). The chefs in real restaurants NEVER throw plates in the wall. Some of them can shout on you or ask to look at them (eye contact) just to bring something to your attention. ""Yes chef"" is real too.
Chefs NEVER make any food which is out of menu like desert cakes unless it is a daughter of president sitting in the dinning room. They don't cook it primarily because it is time consuming"
" Favorite
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,9,"This is one of my favorite ""hospitality"" movies.
The kitchen settings and characters are pretty accurate. Bradley Cooper is perfect in this role!"
" Could have been so much more!
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,6,"Having spent much of my life in hospitality (bars & clubs), I'd been looking forward to this film.In my experience, most chefs ... certainly the best ones ... are almost invariably insane (one reason I steered mostly clear of restaurants!).Unfortunately, this film is a let-down. Notwithstanding good actors, and a decent concept ... the end result is like a sunken souffl√©. The narrative seems disjointed, the characters disconnected, and there's no real chemistry between anyone there should be ... etc.We don't believe these characters, we don't care about them ... and in a movie like this one, you need to. It's a shame really ... because with a little more thought, this could have been a truly GREAT movie about the kind of pressure and madness that comes with kitchen-life at the highest possible level.But for the reasons noted (and a few others, such as the lame psycho-analytical subplot) it ultimately fell flat ... and to be honest, I was a little sad about that."
" Weak see ""Chef"" instead
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,5,"5/10. Before you watch ""Burnt"" ask yourself have I seen ""Chef"" by John Favreau at least 10 times? If you have then ask yourself have I seen Julia & Julia at least twice? If you can say yes then you can watch this flat, what were the cast thinking, weak script, non-event of a movie where even the food isn't enticing. Oh and the tag line ""Never underestimate a man with everything to lose""? The cockwomble lost everything already because he was a cockwomble. #notaspoilerDid I mention ""Chef""?"
" Cooper's Kitchen Nightmares
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,5,"I generally like Bradley Cooper's intense style but this movie felt like overkill. While it may be a perfectly entertaining fast-paced ride, Burnt is let down by substandard writing, plot errors and tacky dialogue. Cooper's character is far too much of a stereotype flawed genius to be taken seriously and the corny bad guys and predictable romance just cheapen proceedings even further. Ultimately, the whole film feels like a feature-length episode of a Gordon Ramsey show."
" Not a bad movie.
",2020-09-25 00:00:00,8,"There are soooo many negative reviews of this movie. And I feel they're, for the most part, undeserved. So many reviewers want a deep, meaningful movie. Most are not. The vast majority are not. Burnt is not trying to be War and Peace. It's a good, enjoyable, fun movie. Yes, Bradley Cooper's character is not a great human being. Get over it. I love Sienna Miller's character. They are both wonderful actors and have great chemistry. The writing is okay, the directing is okay. But it's the story and what motivates chefs that was intriguing as it could be given we have seen so many chef TV shows. I personally liked it."
" Exciting but at the end of it all... traditional
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,7,"The movies, unlike Bradley Cooper's Adam's quest, is not quite perfect. The movie is not bad, it has a good feel about it, Daniel Br√ºhl playing Tony Balerdi does a really nice job while Bradley plays another self centered and arrogant/genius character for most of the movie. You don't really feel the movie dragging at all but do feed some character and story-lines not 'cooked' enough, like the dynamics between Omar Sy's Michael and Adam. The movie also eventually disintegrates into a everything's great mood which is quite standard after all.1 - 12 Aug 20"
" Exceeded Expectations
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,8,"I didn't know what to expect going in to watching Burnt, but I was hooked from start to finish. Great cast, brilliant writing and a great story. Loved it, highly recommend"
" Could have been a master piece
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,3,"I wouldn't wanna fine dine at a high class restaurant, where they don't wear hats, touches their face during cooking and dips their finder in the gravy and taste it then roughly wipes it on their apron and touches the food again with the same finger and tastes it and does that few more times. What to serving for 3 stars? Meat with Chef's saliva? So unrealistic."
" A good surprise
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,8,It was really a pleasant surprise because I had very low expectations. I expected to see a chick flick to distract and not think about anything and that's why I ended up surprised and immersed in the story.
" Half baked
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,5,"Cooper is Adam, an angry chef who nearly destroyed his career because of his aggressive behaviour and his addictions. Having learn the trade in Paris and on the field, he's now in London trying to rebuild his reputation by gaining the third Michelin star for the restaurant where he's currently employed.Adam works for Tony, who used to be in love with him, but reconsidered and he's also trying to fight his demons attending regular sessions with a shrink.Life inside the kitchen of a Michelin-starred restaurant is pretty much as one would expect, with Adam constantly edgy and shouting orders to a team of sous-chefs who admire and fear him.Helene is one of them and the obvious love interest. She's dedicated to cooking just as Adam and also highly strung.Despite good interpretations by the leads, who learned to move like professional cooks (as it can be seen in many cooking programs) it's difficult to sympathise with Adam's plight. However, the result is a mildly entertaining movie with a plot that makes sense, which nowadays it's not a small achievement."
" Redemption.
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,8,The big message is we can rise back from the ashes and people can change. The journey to top and pit bottom and finally deciding to hit hard again. The life of a chef. I personally was indulged in a movie as I like cooking. I took the journey along with the characters in the movie so that was great for me. Friends we make and pushing each other to achieve great feats. Unable to handle the success when you arent ready and destroying everything. To strive for great you have to work harder even if you are the best. Finally ending on a good note and a better person.
" Burnt is A good Title
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,2,"All I could think about while watching this bloated guitar/motorcycle/grab the girl and kiss her, after you toss her around joke of a movie... Was all the crew members, drivers and catering folks that were telling themselves: ""we're making a real movie!""This is why the rest of the world hates Hollywood. And i've lost all respect for Bradley cooper's acting skills, which was on the way out after lasting only 10 min into his opus with Lady Gaga. Watch what actors do with their hands, it's a sure way to tell if they know what they are doing or not. He has his arms locked together for the whole film, to show how he is struggling to open up to the world, give me a break!And the whole concept of tiny bird droppings on a plate in some upper class library of a restaurant - who gives a damn?"
" As Real A Depiction...
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,9,"Of a fine dining kitchen as I've ever seen. I worked my way through college in a haute cuisine kitchen. My chef didn't just yell, when aggravated enough, he would throw dinner plates."
" Burnt cooks its finely produced ingredients in an unsanitary frying pan.
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,5,"Buttered halibut fillets drizzled in white wine, served with finely chopped parsley accompanied by an aromatic cream sauce. Soft four-tiered celebration cakes baked to perfection, enveloped in decorative fondant icing. Chorizos oozing paprika-hot orange oil over deliciously sweet, white scallops. To become a Michelin starred chef, takes sacrifice. Devoting precious time and substantial amounts of elbow grease to culinary cuisine. Achieving perfection no matter the cost. For Adam, an ambitious American trained by a high-class Parisian chef, one Michelin Star was not enough. Neither was two. He yearned for that elusive third star, notifying the world that he is the best of the best. Producing ""orgasmic"" food, not to satisfy hunger, but to create new experiences. Journeys into new unknown flavours.Wells' dramatic cookery insight into the pressures of producing perfection, is a meticulously cold feature that singes its potential. The underlying theme is ambition. The strive to become a better person. Adam, epitomising ambition with the exaggerated Gordon Ramsay persona, blurs the line between aspiration and arrogance. Humiliating his staff members, notably forcing single-mother Helene to openly apologise to a piece of turbot, and regularly shouting at his employees that their standards do not match his own. Any cook will tell you that the heat of the kitchen provides a ferocious environment, where pressured remarks should not be taken personally. Unfortunately though, Adam fortifies his arrogant attitude when out of the kitchen, forcing a protagonist to lack humility and humanity.Knight's screenplay is undoubtedly the overdone crucial meat ingredient in this feast. Sprinkles of captivating culinary conversations cannot forgive a poorly handled main character whom nobody can relate to. Adam, for all intent and purposes, was an ex-addict whom nearly destroyed his career. Knight attempts to embed a layer of sympathy, persuading us to empathise with Adam whom has progressed optimistically since his downfall. Problem is, the overwrought clich√©s that infest this succulent dish prevent viewers from wanting to become emotionally invested in his story. The inevitable romance with Helene which destroys her strong-willed character, the underdeveloped bond with Tony (waste of LGBT potential), a second opportunity arising and predictably Adam changing his attitude in a sudden fashion. They diminish a potential savoury character study by succumbing to overdone plot points. Much like a fine-dining kitchen, it's an incredibly frustrating experience.Cooper plays the role of arrogance perfectly, and the several moments of anger held much command from his side. Miller, when not falling in love, seamlessly portrayed a strong female cook that could rival Cooper's vexations. Thompson, Vikander and Thurman offering memorable cameos that added additional delight to the frying pan. Goldman's cinematography, especially when displaying the scrumptious food items, exerted a clinical yet clean shine. And of course, whilst not impacting the film, Marcus Wareing training Cooper and Miller was the additional red wine sauce to this beef fillet.Burnt is a competent drama. It has intent. Offering a central ferocious performance amidst its hyperbolic culinary warfare for perfection. Yet, Burnt remains exasperating. The unsavoury nature of the main chef, embodying a personality deemed impossible to relate to, and the eye-rolling clich√©s of Knight's script added ""enough garlic to kill every vampire in Europe"". Sorry, had to get a Ramsay quote in there somehow..."
" Cooper Rules
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,6,"Really great characters, acting and writing. Realistic and fascinating insight into the very high quality, interesting restaurant scene using real chefs added to the authenticity along with Bradley Cooper's ability to mimic a first class chef and oh yes, the food! The crystal clear imagery! They were as much the highlight of the movie as the stars and the storyline.''You mean, cook me breakfast instead of falling in love with me? No. Thank you. I already ate.''I love this stupid movie"
" Pretty good, however...
",2020-02-28 00:00:00,6,"This shows this as a ""comedy""? There were virtually now funny scenes in the whole movie. This is a only a drama! Please change. Don't expect anything comedic when watching this movie."
" Really bad
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,3,"I called it quits with this movie after 30 minutes. The movie just wasn't going to happen and Cooper was totally miscast as a master chef. if you want to see a good kitchen-themed movie, watch Dinner Rush (2000) instead."
" It's okay... but...
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,8,"I like ""kitchen confidential"" than this movie!!
But Cooper's French is very good."
" Though some flaws, wildly underrated.
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,8,"SYNOPSIS:
Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) is a 2-star Michelin chef who is trying to make a comeback after bringing his Paris restaurant down a few years prior. Now, he has a brand new restaurant in London and is looking to receive his 3rd and final Michelin star.REVIEW SUMMARY:
I have to say that I am honestly astonished with how poorly reviewed this film is. In the middle of the movie I looked up the 2016 Oscars expecting this to have been a nomination for Best Picture. It came out in a strong year so I understand why it didn't win, but when my curiosity struck and I checked Rotten Tomatoes... 28%??? Film is subjective, but REALLY? I proceeded to read reviews and I started to understand a little more. This film has a very strong and promising premise, then sprinkled in are a few sub plots that are really misplaced. Jones somehow destroyed the restaurant he prospered in, in Paris and that's only referred to and never explained which I'm completely fine with, but then they keep referring to it. To the point where the major twist (which I loved) is related. Then there's a maestro/love story going on between Cooper and Sienna Miller that I vividly remembered, but really hoped I remembered incorrectly. Then a couple of guys who he apparently owes money to show up a couple of times, Jones's relationship with Reece, which appears to be important, but isn't fleshed out in any way and finally side story of Tony being in love with Jones, which doesn't do anything for the story in the slightest. With all of that being said... what a gorgeously messy film. The acting is amazing, the twist is spectacular and the direction is so beautiful and wonderfully paced. I understand how misdirected the film is, but there is so much good there that I don't understand the extreme hate. I'm thoroughly shocked. 8.3/10.---------------------------------------BREAKDOWN----------------------------------------DIRECTION:
The direction in this film is beautiful. The shots are so amazing and the color palette is great. Maybe the writing has a few flaws, but the direction of a flawed movie was quite impressive. Especially from someone who doesn't really direct anything or more-so TV shows. He picks the right shots for the right moments that really collect the emotion straight from any of these amazing performances. I haven't seen every rating for every movie that I've seen, but this might be the most underrated film that I've seen. OH, and the seen with the little girl and the cake in the middle of a full dining area! A complete flip of the character, but so pure and grounded. Amazing work.WRITING:
Okay. Okay... OKAY. Listen. Look. Listen... I kinda get it. KINDA. Get it. BUT... but... I don't really. The reviews I've seen on this film would make anyone who hasn't seen it, feel like this is possibly one of the worst movies of the decade. Sheesh, maybe ever. It's not even close. The title isn't great and everything I mentioned in my review summary may be true, but this film so VERY entertaining. This film is just a couple tweaks and a harder focus on the main characters journey to his third Michelin star away from being damn near perfect. You can't be that close and land so far. Some spectacular writing was in this film. From ""I was almost as good as I thought I was"", really giving you a short and sweet self-perception while he also made himself shuck one million oysters for his failure. Then the encounter where tony says, ""instead of falling in love with me"" which although that subplot was quite pointless, the exchange in that moment was beautiful. There are many flaws in the writing sure, but there are also a lot of gems.ACTING:
The acting is superb. Bradley Cooper is riveting as a fictional chef and then amazing supporting roles from Sienna Miller, Daniel Bruhl, Omar Sy, Matthew Rhys, Emma Thompson, etc... I mean Lily James being in the movie was completely wiped from my memory. I do want to speak specifically about Matthew Rhys and Daniel Bruhl. They were next-level in this. I mean, Daniel Bruhl's best performance to this day is Inglorious Basterds (every actors best performance was in Inglorious Basterds), but he is so solid in this. I can say the same thing about Matthew Rhys. I just found out he's British, today. I mean what the actual fluff is with these Britishians. I'm going to spend a year in the UK just so I can get a more spot-on American accent cause I'm not even sure anymore. Anyway... he also had an almost interesting wish-it-was-fleshed-out role in this film. Either way, the acting was great in this film and aside from messy subplots, I don't really see much issue with this film. It's too bad I found out about the hate so late. I could've maybe saved this film slaughtering."
" Good entertainment
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,7,"If it weren't for dozens of cooking shows on TV this little gem would be regarded as a classic. It's a bit like Frankie and Johnny (1991). Burnt is beautifully filmed and is star studded with great performances. Hats off to casting. Great light entertainment. Oh, and the food looks amazing!"
" Predictable and shallow
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,4,"The only good thing about this movie is the theme. I love cooking, and I'm a foodie, so obviously the theme appealed to me. Unfortunately, this movie is predictable and shallow. Shame. I won't bother listing all the flaws. If you've seen it then you know what I mean.I also just want to say: why in the hell would she kiss him after he grabbed her shirt and screamed in her face? For me, that would be the nail in the coffin on any possibility of a relationship. In fact, I found his behaviour throughout the whole movie to be completely over-the-top."
" Watchable movie,Great actor especially Daniel Br√ºhl (6.9)
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,7,"First of all it was an above average movie, it was definitely not bad but it is not very nice.Acting was really good, maybe it was the most important thing that made the film good.
It's about a chef who used to be a great cook, but later finished his career because of drugs and other bad habits,in fact we don't know the story exactly
there are a few details other than that he didn't exactly tell how he became so bad when he was a good cook.
I think that was one of the missing parts of the film events developed very quickly find a job again to be a top-level cook all developed very quickly so to me the story was weak,multiple scene errors,but the actors have closed most details, especially the daniel br√ºhl acting was tremendous.
as a result I would say good acting is a normal movie but it is watched"
" Changing the love
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,8,"Its good story but it Needed a better love story
Mabe that make a difference
A small touch could change everything
Change the story line and make it more surprising"
" One problem
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,6,"Since this essentially a formula film, I expected a follow-up to Michel's revenge. We were set up for a resolution: Never happened That's all folks....."
" Art of Food
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,6,"It is a little bit disconnected. By the way its nice to see all that food as an art. All the detail which about the food. As a result just food, not good connections. Marvellous to see Emma Thompson. Also Daniel Br√ºhl is really good. Watch for free time or if u like to cook. Not expect much."
" Needs more salt (and a better screenplay)
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,6,"Remember all those decidedly mediocre reviews about this film? Pretty accurate. It IS really well acted and directed. You care about the characters, even Cooper's insufferable protagonist. You cannot help but get sucked into the food preparation and quieter moments. But the screenplay just left a lot to be desired. This is not what opening a restaurant looks like, and this is not how people talk with each other in real life. If you want a chef rehabilitation story, go watch ""Chef"" with Jon Favreau. The fact that this story is still moderately enjoyable is a testament to Cooper, the cast, and the way they gradually/silently became a team over a couple hours. Still, there were some pretty big flaws here. (Side note: Cooper could basically play lovably arrogant burnouts for the rest of his career without much of a problem - he has a gift for this role.)"
" Some heat in the kitchen
",2019-02-06 00:00:00,8,"Food, Food, Food. I will admit I never knew the chef world was so cutthroat, perhaps it's not really and this movie just made it seem that way, but I imagine it's pretty stressful.I think Bradley Cooper did a fantastic job as Adam Jones, he comes across as believable in terms of a recovering drug addict/alcoholic and his intensity during his being upset was quite believable. I liked him in this role, liked him enough to actually want to see more of this story, I really wouldn't' mind a storyline either post this movie or of his exploits in Lousiana.Overall, the movie was definitely entertaining and I would absolutely recommend/watch again."
" Constant Conflict
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,6,The story is high-strung and full of conflict. That's what it's about. But the film has almost no structure because it's constantly at a fever pitch. Way too over the top for me without much ebb and flow.
" Instant favorite
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,9,"The people giving this movie a bad review need to get over themselves. If you're on the fence about seeing it, then definitely see it. If you're a foodie, chef/cook. restauranter, etc. then this movie is required viewing.It's not often you get to see the grit and edge of people in real life, on screen, and this movie has that in spades, but at the same time balances it with tear jerking tender moments that are all the sweeter because of the bitter that they're sandwiched in.The directing/acting/cinematography and scoring are all top notch. The editing was slick and moved the movie along at an exciting pace while still conveying everything it needed to. I'm a stickler about movies being too long, but this movie could have been an hour longer and I would have loved it. My only complaint with it is that I didn't get to see more character developement of the other kitchen staff, but hey, cuts have to be made somewhere..Above all this movie has heart, but never felt manipulative. It avoided many of the hollywood cliches and tropes, and when it did have one, it was so beautifully done that I didn't care - I was on board and emotionally invested. I'll probably watch this movie at least 1-2 more times with other friends or something. I feel like it's a bit of a hidden gem..."
" Forgettable. Skip it.
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,4,"It's been said that Burnt is essentially the same story as Jon Favreau's Chef. Yes, it's about a chef who loses his way and has to find himself again. Other than that, the films are totally different in every way.I struggled to maintain interest in this film. The story was very unfocused. For a film about food, they really dropped the ball on the cinematography.It's slow moving. The characters weren't interesting. By the end, I really didn't care what happened."
" Criminally underrated starring Bradley Cooper as a Gordon Ramsey wannabe
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,7,"I stumbled on this by accident as I wanted to watch something that I never seen before and saw this on Netflix.
The story is about a struggling chef named Adam (played by Bradley Cooper)who's life inspires around Drugs and Alcohol as he owns money to some drug dealers. But when he opens up his own restaurant with the help of a divorced mother (played by Sienna Miller) will he become sober and be the best chef there is.With a strong supporting cast including Emma Thompson as Adam's nurse,Lily James (in a 5 minute cameo in the beginning of the film as Adam's friends girlfriend), Uma Thurman as a food tester(also a cameo) and Alicia Valderker as Adam's ex girlfriend the movie was actually fairly good. Bradley Cooper was brilliant as always as a Gordon Ramsey wannabe chef who drops ALOT of F bombs and throwing tantrums like a schoolboy. Himself and Sienna Miller had good chemistry.
If you liked that film No Reservations then you may like it."
" Load of Balls
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,1,"Load of balls, did i say load of big hairy balls? Incase you misheard, THIS FILM IS A BIG LOAD OF BALLS."
" Waste of time
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,2,"This movie is just impossible to follow. Scenes just skip from one to another without any connection. The characters are not even introduced, sometimes maybe you get a little word about who someone is and that's it. You never know when the movie is happening. It's impossible to follow any time frame - has it been a day since the last scene, has it been a month, half a year , two years - you will never know. They make it look like opening a restaurant takes like 5 minutes, you will never know if the day has even past. And the ending is terrible - it just ends out of nowhere. I can imagine how disappointing it was to watch this mess at the movies when you have actually paid for it ( I saw it on Netflix). And I can not imagine that the director sat down to see his creation and after it was he said - this is great, release it . Maybe he hadn't had his coffee that day and slept through the whole thing."
" a true kitchen experience
",2018-11-12 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because it shows you what it toll it would take in order to be considered a Michelin star worthy chef. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good. Especially by Bradly Cooper who stands out above the rest of the cast at first as the very cocky Adam Jones than the humble and disciplined Adam Jones. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Great movie
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,10,"Loved this movie, great character building and story line, as a good lover it told a great story about passion for cooking and how life isn't always so simply"
" waste of time and money
",2018-09-21 00:00:00,1,"A low budget copy of chefs table from netflix, with this cast we deserve a better quality movie... Looks like a corporative video or an ad for a chefs something tv show. Waste of time."
" Fresh take on genius chef who thinks he's God
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,9,Fresh take on genius chef who thinks he's God. Bradley Cooper makes the movie more than can be expected with cooking shows on TV 24/7.
" It will make you hungry!
",2018-06-05 00:00:00,8,"The script and brilliant acting summarise Burnt. You just want to spend time with Emma Thompson, drink wine with Daniel Br√ºhl and eat Bradley Coopers food. The storyline is not to heavy or to light, just perfect!"
" Oui Chef!
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,8,"Having a background in the restaurant industry. This film was quite relatable. Many viewers will find this movie over exaggerated but it is definitely not. I actually found it to be painfully realistic. I will admit that the story progresses too quick (as it must in most films). Restaurants are a fascinating cultural study. From the people who cook for them, to the front of house workers.. to the customers themselves. This movie highlights the pressure and the teamwork required to operate at the highest level and that is why I enjoyed it so much."
" First Course Was Enough
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,4,Worse than a reality TV show. Only got through first course.
" Pretentious and unenjoyable
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,1,"As both a food film and a character film, this fails on both. The characters are overdone, unrealistic, exaggerated but somehow also two dimensional. The main character goes through a journey of development and improvement that is both fake and forced. As a food film, the shots of food, cooking, and discussions about food are not at all honest or pleasurable. Pointless film, overall. There are so many better food films these days, you'd be silly to waste your time on this one or consider it a movie for others to live up to."
" This is the worst movie I've seen in my life.
",2018-04-19 00:00:00,1,"I walked out an hour into it and got my money back.
It was in multiple dialogues of English, French, and Italian all at once. The dialogue didn't make sense. One person would say something, and the next person would say something completely unrelated. It's like they were all expressing their thoughts but not having a conversation.
My head felt like it was going to explode. And when 3 years later I saw this DVD for sale at Walmart, I was reminded of how bad this movie and now I have a headache again.
I don't understand how this piece of garbage could have won any reviews. Maybe the pharmaceutical companies paid money to give this money a reward in hopes people would go see it and then have to buy headache medication and antipsychotics to deal with the brain damage of having watching this piece of crap movie."
" Why so few good reviews?
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,8,"Excellent acting. Excellent pace. Beautiful, energetic kitchen scenes. A few touching scenes here and there. Like cooking itself, this movie is about many things - love, passion, friendship, jealousy. When it was done I realized the plot had been somewhat predictable, but it's tastefully done, and you don't notice it until after the end, immersed as you are in the story. If you like cooking, or food, or French, or London, you'll likely enjoy this movie. Me? I loved it."
" An under-cooked recipe that never reaches the boil let alone burns
",2018-03-20 00:00:00,4,"People are probably tired of hearing me say what is going to be said now, being not the first time it's been said. Only because it is applicable to more than one film. 'Burnt' had an interesting idea that indicated a good story if done right, a talented cast deserving of material worthy of them and it would certainly entice anybody who enjoys their food and likes fine dining. 'Burnt' is not an awful film by any stretch and certainly is not a film with no redeeming values, but it is not hard to see why reviews were lukewarm to negative. There was a good film somewhere in 'Burnt', sadly despite such great promise it never emerges. Essentially it was a lukewarm bland film that would have basically fared better with less ingredients and cooked the remaining elements all the way through. There are things that work in 'Burnt's' favour and stops it from being completely raw. Sorry for the food/cooking references, can't resist. The best thing about it is Bradley Cooper, an excellent performance that burns with intensity regardless of the one-dimensional and trying-too-hard-to-be-a-demon-chef way his character is written. Daniel Bruhl also rises above the material. Sienna Miller gives 'Burnt' some heart and charm, a very competent performance actually considering what was given to her (which generally was not a whole lot to write home about) and her personal life, while very clich√©d, is somewhat identifiable and just about avoids the over-sentimentality route. It's competently filmed, the soundtrack while not unforgettable is nice enough and the food is delicious-looking and how the ways it's cooked is portrayed makes one want to cook something in your own privacy.Not all the cast come off well, well actually the rest of the cast. They all try their best, but they are either wasted (Emma Thompson), useless (Alicia Vikander, her character and writing rather than her) or forgettable (Uma Thurman). They are undone by a half-baked script that not even the excessive swearing can give heat to, apart from the odd witty line, and sketchy characterisation where any attempts at development is generally vague. Its portrayal of how kitchen life works came over as over-heated, as fulfilling and exciting it can be it is also very stressful but not to an extent that feels like a wannabe version of 'Hell's Kitchen', if nowhere near as fake or staged but without the savage and hilarious one-liners and insults (at least on that show Gordon Ramsay has a reason to act that way, the main character's behaviour was far too extreme and out of order regardless of his struggles to atone). It certainly does not make one seriously consider going into cooking as a profession, have dealt with my fair share of pressure but this amount shown here would see me quit within hours. Even with the presence of food, it could have featured more and 'Burnt' never feels like a celebration of it and lacks any kind of joy or colour. Its attempts at dissecting the chef's mind never goes deep enough or explored properly, it just feels vague and under-done. The underworld debt subplot never catches fire and lacks tension completely, wouldn't have said no to it being left out and the film finding another way of the main character starting afresh. The film and its messaging may have been identifiable and relevant, if it rang true, had subtlety, had a main character worth rooting for and didn't override itself in clich√©s. 'Burnt' is a failure at all four (though the third point has no bearing on Cooper), big missed opportunity.At the end of the day, 'Burnt' was an at times digestible but empty experience, an under-cooked recipe that never reaches the boil let alone burns. 4/10 Bethany Cox"
" A delightful film
",2018-03-15 00:00:00,9,I just happened to watch this film with no expectations. It turned out to be one of my favorites of the year. A perfect blend of great acting and witty dialogue. Bradley Cooper and Daniel Bruhl are particularly excellent. This film exposed a world I was unaware of in the kitchens of top chefs. The pressure and the conditions that exist when pursuing Michelin validation. Highly recommended. I rate it a 9 out of 10.
" Good
",2018-03-07 00:00:00,7,The movie was very good I have seen a different story after so many years must watch
" Just watched it the 9th time!
",2018-02-14 00:00:00,10,"As my click-batty title may apply, I really enjoyed watching this movie!Everything in it is just gold!I am becoming a real fanboy of Bradley. Everything he plays in is just freaking amazing! - sorry for the passion - but you can really see his preparation of each role. The fact that he knows French, studied Gordon Ramsey and other great chefs, worked in a kitchen for a while, really shows in this masterpiece of a movie!
 
I also liked the little touch, that not everyone may know, where most of the kitchen staff, were actually real cooks and chefs. I was a bit skeptical about all other actors, like Sienna, Daniel, etc., but...
bravo (clap, clap). They were amazing.The movie resonates with me on a deep level, since I'm a business owner, working in the creative field and aiming to reach the premium level as portraid here. In a nutshell. Great movie with an amazing story and some of the best performances I ever seen.A must watch!"
" Initially reluctant viewer but morphed into an entertained and delighted viewer
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,9,"I watched this film for two reasons; The first was simply Bradley Cooper, who knocked me out in American Hustle and entertained in the Hangover movies, in particular the first installment, the second reason was wife pressure! I reluctantly started watching but was quickly intrigued with Bradley's performance and was curious regarding the alluded to history at the start of the film. History that had brought Bradley's character (Adam) to where he found himself at that moment in the film, and I wanted to know that history! What an entertaining vehicle, it never disappointed and once engaged there was no way I was not going to see it to the end! Bradley you've become a fine actor and I look forward to more of your performances! By the way the supporting cast was superb!"
" Ratatouille - Human edition
",2018-01-12 00:00:00,7,"This is an amazing movie, but not so exciting. Maybe i'll watch this again, maybe a few more times :)"
" Cooking Animes does it 10x better
",2017-12-15 00:00:00,3,"Better off watching any of the cooking centered anime series. Or just watch one of those cook off shows on TV since that portrays as you feel that there are actual stakes in their effort, and real emotions. This movie is just a plain drama of redemption that is coincidentally features chefs (but not cooking nor the passion in making the perfect dish). A standard formula that is made to showcase Bradley only. Nothing else."
" Angry Chef film
",2017-11-13 00:00:00,4,"Burnt is another film about a top chef, and in many cases the chef is a world class known chef. In Burnt, Bradley Cooper plays an over the top angry chef with several past struggles about drug abuse and such, quite like Gordon Ramsay. The film is labeled a comedy but isn't too much of one, more so a struggling drama as it takes itself a little too serious. There are some decent scenes showing the foods they make but overall, Burnt is quite predictable, as we know in the end everything will work out, and his character will become more likable and nicer once becoming more comfortable in his surroundings. Sienna Miller is there to play the love interest which was very clear it was going to happen but somewhat feels forced. The language could have been toned down a little and done without as many F- bombs, which is the reason for the R rating.Perhaps had they reduced the film to PG-13 it would have been more of a success. In comparison to the John Favreau film ""Chef"", that feels more authentic and much more enjoyable, fun and doesn't take itself as serious."
" Solid Ingredients, Flawed Preparation
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,4,"(Flash Review)It appears the director aimed to portray Gordon Ramsey and what life may be like if you interact with him, only leave out Gordon's unique and arguable charm. The story arc was rather vanilla about a phenomenal chef who ruined his own early success for a decade and now is revitalized and wants to make another go at it in hopes of achieving the rare three Michelin stars. Yet he is still rude and harshly passionate while in the kitchen and in life. There were too many clich√© moments and the romance angle was not believable. The plot focused more around the protagonist, his emotions and problems with the food as an afterthought. That's OK but they had a slew of elegant food shots but the editing was so frantic during those scenes that you couldn't even see what the food was or the beauty of the plating. At least give us that much in a high end food movie. The positives were the production and the acting as Bradley Cooper was great and Sienna Miller was invisible as her character. The Hundred-Foot Journey was a better food/chef movie and that was just a step above average."
" A Delicious Story on Courage and Redemption
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,8,"This is why critics can only be used as a guide. I understand why the reception for this film might be low, but I do not agree. I feel that the pros outweigh the cons in this situation and that criticism was harsh overall. Why? The Good. * Yes, it was mostly clich√© and predictable. Key word, mostly. It was not exactly an accurate representation of the chef life. However, there were enough unexpected detours and plot twists (admittedly, ""twists"" might be a little strong) to make it a pleasure to watch. *Bradley Cooper plays his usual role, tough boy hiding his soft heart with his defense mechanisms, but he does this character splendidly. I, for one, do not tire of it. When a great actor had found something he does well, he can mix it up enough in each performance to perfect it. * Supporting cast including Sienna Miller, Daniel Br√ºhl, Omar Sy, Matthew Rhys, Alicia Vikamder, Emma Thompson, and Uma Thurman may not have had much screen time, but they were nevertheless impressive all around. * Cinematographer Adriano Goldman is meticulous with his magnificent food shots, but also gives notable care to showing us the city of London from different perspectives. * Quite the quotable film. For one thing, it had quite a lot to teach us about leadership and success if we take the time to really analyze the dialogue. Sara: He scares me. David: He is a two-star Michelin chef. He is supposed to be scary. Sara: Well, ""two"" doesn't seem like many. David: To get even one Michelin star, you have to be like Luke Skywalker. Okay? To get two, you have to be whoever Alec Guinness was. But if you manage to get three, you are Yoda. Sara: Well, what if he's Darth Vader?Adam: Consistency is death... No, a chef should strive to be consistent in experience, but not consistent in taste. It's like sex. It's like, you're always headed to the same place, but you got to find new and dangerous way of getting there.Adam: Cooking is an expression of what? Tell me. Helene: At its best, of sustaining someone with love. Adam: I do not want it to be a place where you come and eat. We should be dealing in culinary orgasms. When's the last time you had an orgasm that was interesting?... People eat because they are hungry. I want to make food that makes people stop eating. Cooking is an expression of who we are... I want people to sit at that table and be sick with longing. Reece: You are better than me. But the rest of us need you to lead us to places we would not otherwise go. Doctor Rosshilde: There is strength in needing others, not weakness. The Bad. * Admittedly, the plot was a little generic, full transformation for our hero. But, sometimes generic is generic because it works. * The LGBT part where Tony is in love with Adam was weird and distracting. Since it did not add anything substantial to the story, it probably did more harm than good. * I would have preferred the film take that risk and have Adam not get that third Michelin Star. Like the psychoanalyst played by Emma Thompson, ""What happens when you get that third star? What happens if you fail?"" It would have been nice to see this bad boy actually not get this and see how he deals. * To elaborate on the accuracy of this film, perhaps I should clarify that it might be accurate as a guide, but as most Hollywood films unfortunately do, it focuses on more entertaining situations than the mundane duties. In general, I support accuracy over watchability, but I have to admit that sometimes we simply want to be entertained. (http://firstwefeast.com/eat/2015/11/a- professional-chef-critiques-the-movie-burnt) The Amazing. * Above all, I am a food lover. I read about chefs. I always try to meet them when I know their name. I respect them. I go out of my way to try new cuisines, new establishments, different approaches to dining, and especially unique dishes and even novelty ones. I do not discriminate against the local hole in the walls because those are often the best. Marcus Wareing and Mario Batalo were behind this film as Chef Consultants. Gordon Ramsey was a producer. Clare Smyth trained with Bradley Cooper. You better bet that, with their names on this, it was at least a somewhat accurate representation of the culinary world, or ""The Industry"" as those in the know tend to call it. It does not surprise me that, as a boy, Cooper wanted to be either a chef or an actor. He also played a chef previously in the series ""Kitchen Confidential"", based on none other than the eminent Anthony Bourdain. Last but not least, there were some pretty orgasmic food shots and montages in the beautiful kitchens as Adam was in his element. * Maybe it was clich√© to some, but the final scene almost bought a tear to my eyes to see Chef Adam sit down for the first time with his crew for a family dinner. His final lines were to give appreciation and the closing shot was Helene smiling at him, acknowledging the significance of this. He is finally letting go a little, learning to trust others. As evidenced in his reaction when Michelin showed up this time (composed, carrying on as always versus panicking & yelling at everyone in the kitchen), he is finally working on his Lone Ranger Syndrome. It should be noted that I am actually the first person to react cynically to a bow-tie Hollywood ending, but this time it worked for me."
" Subtle, very nice story
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,9,"One of Bradley Cooper's best performances. Very subtle nuisances in his performance. The classic hero emerges with a new reality by story's end and so does Cooper. So many films hit you over the head with it, but this one..again...subtle. Love the story, hate the story, you cannot beat BC's performance."
" Oh god another Bradley Cooper damaged genius bad boy movie
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,5,Lemme guess he used to be great but 'threw it all away'. He's on a mission of personal redemption. Every one love hates him. He falls in love with his chief competition who of course hates him and adores him. He's substituted drugs and booze for being a colossal a-hole user of people because he's just that talented. He IS the most interesting man in the world. Before him no one ate food. Other than that this is movie where you hear Bradley speak pretty French where you watch people make and eat pretty good food and there's a lot and I mean a lot of histrionics.
" Couldn't be bothered to give a damn
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,5,"Its a well known plot device that we are presented with difficult and troubled characters who act like a-holes and we're supposed to infer they are actually deep and worthy of our sympathy. Of course, the two main jerks in this film are destined to fall in love and learn a life lesson in the process, voila! But in this case, the two main stars Sienna Miller and Bradley Cooper don't seem worth of much sympathy at all. Herein, the movie fails.Sienna Miller's character is raising a young daughter alone, but this doesn't seem like a good enough reason for her bitchiness. Bradley Cooper is a recovering drug addict who stabbed everybody in the back in the past and seeks a new start now that he is in recovery. Obviously, people are suspicious of him and cautious as he plays the diva chef to the hilt when Daniel Bruhl's character gives him a chance as head chef in a new restaurant in London. Its hard to describe the repulsiveness of Cooper's character and why anybody puts up with him. He and Sienna's character ""bond"" over trying out new recipes, but even that doesn't seem to give humility to Cooper. Didn't he learn anything from shucking 1 million oysters in a New Orleans dive bar as penance for his character flaws? Frankly, even his food looks puny and un-appetizing and we're supposed to believe its haute cuisine and the work of a master!Things happen that aren't very interesting and in the end Cooper wins a Michelin star (or two or three, I don't remember) and all is well and he has learned his lesson and everybody's happy! Forget that he tortured everybody with his tantrums during the whole process. Funny thing is, the audience was never rooting for Cooper in the first place. If you want to see a terrific chef movie, see ""Big Night"" with Tony Shaloub and Stanley Tucci. Burnt doesn't hold a candle to his terrific film about what being a chef and owning a restaurant is really like."
" yawn ..
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,2,"this movie is boring and the director doesn't seem to know what story he wants to tell us. the redemption of a tormented and talented soul? the behind the doors of a two stars kitchen? the pursuit of glory? No idea. I can't even tell if it's a drama or a comedy. it's a cold movie, that's for sure"
" A Recipe which was not wasted
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,6,Iam an admirer of Bradley cooper and watched the movie due to his presence. All the characters are well placed and not wasted. It was good seeing Uma Thurman. Sienna Miller and cooper had a good chemistry going on between them throughout the film. Bradley cooper plays an ambitious chef who lost his way early due to drugs. Cooper handled french convincingly enough. The movie is not circled around a big story but a very well paced feel good one. It is the tale of every failed individual who makes a comeback to achieve the glory.
" Smoking Hypocrisy
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,7,"I liked the movie, but it brought up an issue that confuses me. It's a widely documented fact that smoking dulls the sense of smell and taste. How can a chef who smokes, pursuing a Michelin star, claim to be able to discern subtle flavors and pass judgment on the acceptability of a dish? While viewing the film, seeing three of the chefs smoking and then critiquing the food, I thought this must be a goof. Later, doing more research on the internet I see this is a common practice. Really???"
" Better than reviewed.
",2017-05-22 00:00:00,10,"I'm not sure why Burnt didn't make it to theaters but it's much better than its reviews. I'm giving it a 10 because it doesn't lag, it tells the story and gets out! Good script, good acting and good camera work. It is a little frenetic at some points but that's how busy kitchens are anyway. And use the captions, it can be hard to hear and follow at times. Give it a chance, you might like it?"
" Bradley Cooper, Master Chef
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,7,"The film Burnt came out in 2015 and won six awards here and there. Nevertheless, it did not do particularly well at the box office.It must have been badly marketed, because I found it delightful and well acted by Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, Daniel Bruhl, Matthew Rhys, Emma Thompson, and Uma Thurman.Cooper plays Adam Jones, a highly successful chef in France who wrecked his life with drugs, booze, and women. He comes to London to reinvent himself as a premiere chef and wants a third star from Michelin. He looks up people he worked with in Paris and attempts to convince them to work for him, and he also looks for new people. He's impressed with a sous chef (Sienna Miller), who doesn't like him at first. Adam decides to take over his friend Tony's (Daniel Bruhl) restaurant by showing up the night that Michelin is in the restaurant. With his reputation on the line, Tony has no choice but to let him cook.With a team in place, Adam shows himself to be a complete perfectionist who yells, screams, and breaks dishes when the food isn't the way he wants it. One night, after what he thinks is a complete disaster, he shows up wasted at the restaurant of a rival (Matthew Rhys) who tries to help.Such a fun and interesting film, and who minds looking at Bradley Cooper? We get to see some of what goes on in the kitchen of a top restaurant - the film used top people as consultants - and learn just enough to make us curious about what is a truly fine art.Highly recommended."
" Sub TV-movie
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,6,"Pretty awful. A TV movie would be better. At least watching a Lifetime flick I will care a little about the characters and have a lump in my throat at the end. This thing, I wanted to waterboard the characters with soup from the Seinfield episode of the Soup Nazi, ""Plenty soup for you!"" I wish IMDb had a way to tag writers so that there is a pop-up warning displayed anytime you look at any of their movies. I gave this flick a try since I watched ""Chef (2014)"" a few weeks ago and I liked it. This one is perfectly incoherent. They trot out the worn-out tripe that a great chef has to be an infant terrible, emphasis on the infant. Then they have Bradley-Brad's competitor telling him that Bradley-Brad is a better chef, and that the competitor ""needs him"" ya know, to be better and give him something to strive for. What crap.If Bradley-Brad did stumble into the competitor's kitchen drunk and raving, the competitor would have filmed it with his iPhone and posted it on Facebook 20 seconds after it happened. Then he would have let Bradley-Brad put the bag over his head and walked out of the kitchen smoked a cigarette, and gone to a pay phone to call the cops, explaining ""This drunk raving lunatic came into my kitchen and put a sous vide bag over his head"".And sous vide as some avant garde cooking technique, please. How 2000. Maybe having Samoans roast a pig in the yard every night, that would be something different. Chez Poly. All the supposed food porn just turned me off. It was like real porn, over-demonstrative and completely unable to convey the subtle joys of the activity.And the story arc is as unbelievable as the supposed avant garde cooking. He was a rotten viscous dope-fiend prick. Then he shucked a million oysters, and found redemption?! And he is now a good person when he finally goes to group therapy. A rotten prick never ever changes, it wired in, hardwired. But being humiliated and given an old set of knives and he becomes a decent loving step-dad role model. Judging from the waif-like appearance of his ex-girlfriend Bradley-Brad would have started abusing the little girl daughter in a couple years, while holding her mom's job as leverage to keep the whole thing quiet.Chef Ramsey might throw pans around the kitchen, but that is just drama porn meant to keep people watching something on par with seeing paint dry. If a chef did that in real life he would be drawn up before the labor relations commission and sued for his entire net worth every time it happened. And how about the female lead for mother of the year? The way her kid bosses her around, no wonder she takes Bradley-Brad's BS. If she didn't give in after 12 seconds her kid would have eaten the oatmeal instead of bribing the little rotten monster with coco puffs (deleted scene). Maybe if the rotten hell-child was wearing the oatmeal and made to go to school a few times, she might learn the social utility of listening to her mom.What a hollow empty narcissist, to try an please some French frog idiots, rather than make a decent meal for the customers paying him exorbitant money. ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" was pretty good. But note it was about the people, not the food. Burnt is like some Asperger examination of the food more than the people, since none of the people made any sense and none of them were consistent or believable. So I guess it had to be about the food. To fix a movie with such a bad script is not a matter of a few re-shoots. Since this is pretty much a sausage fest, like a war movie, lets make the girl lead into the star. All the actors are great in this thing, a tribute to their professionalism. So make Bradley-Brad a believable narcissist sociopath by having him stay a narcissist sociopath the whole flick. Have the gal battle him the whole movie, until by the end the staff and owner and customers band behind her to get Bradley-Brad tossed out onto the street, a homeless bum. Maybe have her end up with the competitor, who helps her destroy Bradley-Brad, a commentary on how society can defeat sociopaths if we stick together.Another theme could be how narcissist sociopaths so need to hurt people, they will start hurting themselves when the victims wise up and shun them. So sure, have Bradley-Brad seduce the gal and use his charm and cooking and witty repartee. Then after he tries to rape the little girl, lets have mom destroy him. And lets shoot a lot of new footage showing the mom to be a decent mother, not a phone-it-in mother. Eighty five million domestic gross and think of the action figures and marketing tie ins. Maybe go really dark and have her stab Bradley-Brad as he tries to rape the little girl yet again, and then you could sell the knife kit as a great tie-in. Its not just a Ginsu, its a statement of social justice.Meanwhile, am I the only guy that will place a fork on the floor every time I go out to eat? I suspect the Michelin people were laughing as hard as all the real cooks when they watched this. That is not to say a Michelin taster never tried the fork trick, sometime in 1950, and that is not so say the tasters were exclusively two middle-aged men, back in 1960. But even if the fork play is pure BS, the wanna-be restaurants don't know that and I thankfully meet the demographic of the supposed Michelin taster. Next movie lets have them check the tires on the customer's cars to find the Michelin men."
" ***1/2
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,9,"The portions might be small, but the food and film seemed delicious.Having been the master chef, but losing everything due to his lifestyle, Bradley Cooper sets out to rebuild his reputation in this film.A perfectionist to the core, part of the film is devoted for him attempting to assemble a group to work with. He proves impossible to work with. He is a visionary, and against consistency in food. Something variable or different must be on the menu and he instills his love for the culinary among his workers.Other parts of the film are dedicated to pleasing the food critics.I wonder how much weight was gained by Cooper and others while filming took place. With the relatively small portions, probably not that much."
