" A wasteful two hours
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,1,"That's two hours I'll never get back. Jared Leto is the worst thing in this movie. If you want something good, you won't find it here."
" I actually enjoyed this movie
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,10,"It was entertaining from beginning to end. The cast was awesome. If anything, I wish they'd focus a lil less on deadshot and harley quinn."
" #ReleaseTheAyerCut
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,10,Another movie scraped by Warner Brothers. David Ayer deserves to being able to release his real vision and cut of Suicide Squad. #ReleaseTheAyerCut.
" Only for Entertainment purposes
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,8,"Loved the graphics and the acting of each individual in this movie especially Joker and Harley Quinn made had a very exotic appearance in this movie.Good to watch on a weekend with friends.I think the movie can have been slightly better, I didn't like the rapidly changing of plots. The story could've had more smoothness and interconnection between the plots.However, it involves some severe scenes and dialogues like Harley Quinn going crazy in love, the fire guy being over agressive and the U. S government being selfish etc which looks amazing on the screen but not in real life.Hence watch it just as Entertainment. Nothing can be implemented in the life.Though you can definitely observe that if there's team work, there's a mix of skills and so anything can be achieved with ease. Also that you must not lose your current loved ones because of beloved lost in the past.You won't be disappointed with the movie, that's guaranteed."
" I like this film.
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,9,"I find it so entertaining and fun, the cast is great, especially Will Smith and Joel Kinnaman but Margot Robbie is exceptional as Harley Quinn.My only problem with this film is Jared Leto as The Joker, he is the worst Joker I've ever seen and should never play the part again."
" Tbh it's not that bad of a movie
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,7,"I actually had quite a lot of fun with this movie. I'm talking about the extended cut not the theatrical, that ones alright. The extended cut has more character development, more joker, and fleshes the movie out a little more. Of course I wish we had Ayers cut of the movie but even if we don't get it (still hoping we Will eventually) I'm very much satisfied with the extended cut. So i recommend that you check out the extended cut, not the theatrical."
" Painful. Horribly inconsistent, and mental anguish.
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,1,"Not one plot point in this film was consistent with the story. By the end of it I wanted to break my TV, not enough alcohol in the world could help me forget how horrible and terrible this movie was. I completely regret watching it four years later for the first time..."
" Not bad, could be better
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,8,"This movie was over all good, it really captured each character well, and yes I did like the Joker."
" Not worth anyone's time.
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,4,"Only thing great about this film is the music. Otherwise it's pretty dull and badly written, featuring the worst Joker in history. Oh also Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is pretty sexy."
" lame action film
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,2,"Entertaining at times, but only if you are extremely bored. The bad scripting makes the good actors in this movie look second rate. The scripting is all tell, no show. Cool characters are turned into trailer clips and one-sided characters. The plot has no depth whatsoever, and the movie is obviously created for people who have no depth whatsoever. No hate to the actors, it's obvious they had nothing to work with, they were the only ones who were able to make this movie entertaining at times. The action scenes were boring. And seriously the character Katana?? cmon"
" It was ok
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,4,Probably would of gave it more stars if it wasnt for that sad excuse of a joker
" Cheerful bad guys
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,3,"OK so I'm not a superhero comics reader, I can't rely on all the knowledge the reviewers keep showing when discussing the characters, or the different - and apparently, competing - superhero sagas. I'm even frankly amazed at all that competence.What brought me here was honestly Harley Queen's ass. I just wanted to witness how this fantastic icon, apparently born in this specific form just within this mess of a movie, is moving around and developing and building up, I wanted to hear her voice. I need to say I'm quite satisfied with her character, all the potential is there for something bound to remain in people's memory long after the movie will be totally and deservedly forgotten. HQ is by far the only enjoyable thing in the movie.Talking about that, well the girl is crazy enough, mildly sexualised (seems like they're trying hard to have her look *very* sexualised but that's all plastic anyhow) and seemingly not being very easily offended. Despite all that the all-male squad - sorry is there that ""Katana"" too...? Katana who? Nice nickname for a girl using a katana non-stop - is always addressing her so politely, with an astonishing decency so stupidly unreal. What, aren't they the baddest among the bad? The worst dregs of society? The public enemys #2 on? - #1 being the Jocker of course... Ahah -Clearly in contemporary movies villains know very well how to behave and always be politically correct. Hilariously bad.The most tragically comic part of the movie is when the supposed evil in full-power Enchantress, having the evil-from-the-other-side Amanda totally subdued, thus being able to have the entire squad's heads instantly blown up, induces instead in their heads ""their wildest dreams"" with the aim to distract them. So you find that Deadshot just wants to shot Batman dead, while HQ dreams of a middle-class family life with her darling Jocker and 2 blond toddles, and El Diablo just wants his family back. Luckily we're spared Killer Croc dreaming of some Tony Manero's moves surrounded by cheering girls. I mean, are these the inner most sought-after desires of the craziest assassins Amanda was able to source? More like, lazy deluded middle-class guys?The depressing outcome is that these bad guys aren't bad guys at all, they're just a shadow, a paper-thin drawing, a failed hint at bad guys. They're the bad guys next door. Especially this, more than the stupid and lazy script, more than obvious plot holes, more than ineffective monsters, makes this movie a sad mess. I know that this is based on a comic strip, where they don't usually delve on tense character development, here however the level is that of flatlining emptiness. As long as in comics, evil characters can be flat, but sure they can be truly evil.Particularly bad is Deadshot's character - the ice-hearted killer not shooting Batman, thus being held prisoner by him, because his teen daughter asks him. The later hint of his dear daughter treasuring geometry with him to her interest in bullets' trajectories is one of the all-time lows in the movie. So badly out-of-character with no reason.Honorable mention for Cara Delevigne - I don't like her even when she's on her arguably competent side, modeling. Can you imagine how I feel by looking at her trying to act...?The 3 stars are all for Harley Queen. Too bad that this version of hers will start and end with this movie."
" Low Expectations Are The Key
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,6,"I'm not a superhero fan. When I was a kid I read comic books, but not DC or Marvel. I read only the Warren Magazines, Eerie, Creepy, and Vampirella. They were for older readers. They were straight horror, in black and white. They often attempted social commentary, and they always had darker plot lines.All of which is to say I had no expectations for Suicide Squad. I caught it on TV on Sunday afternoon when I had nothing else to do. And I liked it a lot. Will Smith is getting older, but he gives Deadshot, the leader of the super villains, a lot more dignity and a lot more intelligence than a younger actor could have. Margot Robbie is so amazingly over the top as Harley Quinn. She's as funny as Carole Lombard in My Man Godfrey, and as terrifying as Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet. And when she waves that baseball bat around, she's as brave and crazy and glamorous and tragic as James Remar playing Ajax in The Warriors.The plot of this movie -- evil villains fighting for the good guys and getting sent on a suicide mission -- is clearly drawn from the Lee Marvin movie, the Dirty Dozen. But the mood and tone and feel of the film is more like Walter Hill's The Warriors. It's not just Hayley Quinn's baseball bat. It's the lonely, unwanted heroes walking down dark New York City streets. It's the sense that the whole world is against them. And there's the all-powerful black woman who cooly narrates the story like she's the Chorus in a Greek tragedy -- or an all-night DJ on an underground radio station.""Be looking good, Boppers -- all the way back to Arkham Asylyum."""
" So Unimpressive
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,4,I could not get into this film. Was this the most expensive student film ever made? It felt that way. This was the film that made me appreciate how Marvel are handling their films. I keep asking myself - how could Will Smith choose this role and turn down DJango? I'll never know. I'm sure if I was 10 years old I might appreciate the film... probably not actually.
" In the case of the title, there should always be a squad like that present when attempting to view this ""film"".
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,4,"""Suicide Squad"" (2016), as usual, the DC Extended Universe has shot itself in the foot, yet again. Just when you think the modern day DC films can't possibly get any worse, they prove you wrong. This is one of the worst DC superhero movies of all-time. Seriously, it's so bad that I almost couldn't finish it! It's so terrible that it's actually obnoxious. Wow, that's such a rare combination for a bad film, obnoxiously boring! This ""film"" has a predictable and dull storyline, average to horrible acting, and a generic cliched soundtrack to tie it all together. The plot is, a secret government agency recruits imprisoned super villains for dangerous assignments and missions. If the Suicide Squad is successful, then their prison sentence will be shortened. That's actually not that bad idea for a plot. The only issue is, that storyline very similar to the one in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014). In that movie, a group of prisoners break out of jail and form a team to stop a group of extraterrestrial criminals. Now, keep in mind, I'm not saying that ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a good film, I'm honestly not a fan of it at all. But, it has a much better understanding of it's original source material and it was executed more smoothly than this ""movie"". It did that plot first, ""Suicide Squad"" pretty much copied it and just tweaked the script to make it a different scenario with the same recycled plot. On top of that, ""Suicide Squad"" is lazy, annoying, boring and you just keep wishing that it would just end already! Like I've said, the concept had great potential. But, poor writing and execution kept it from shining on the screen. As far as the acting goes, it's overall just a total letdown. However, there are two performances that stand out above the rest: Will Smith as Floyd Lawton/Deadshot and Margot Robbie as Doctor Harleen Quinzel/Harley Quinn. Those two really put forth the most effort with their performances. Usually, if Will Smith is in a film, then great acting is usually a given from him. Margot Robbie really nails her respectable character. Had the ""film"" put a little more focus on the two of them, then it might have been more on the right track. The rest of the actors and actresses are just average to terrible. Finally, the soundtrack by Steven Price is a huge disappointment. Granted, there are some parts that are decent. Some of the song choices are good, but all-in-all, it's not memorable otherwise and it's really nothing to write home about. Now, let's get to the only two good elements in this pile of filth. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, they are very well-done, which is no surprise, being a film made in 2016. ""Suicide Squad"" is complete and total waste of film making and one of the absolute worst DC superhero movie. Still, to this day, I'm amazed that I somehow managed to sit all the way through it from beginning to end! I'm giving this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Bottom line, just stay away from ""Suicide Squad"". If you do attempt to watch it, you better make sure that you have the Suicide Hotline on speed-dial! Seriously, this ""movie"" is really that bad."
" It's bad
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,4,"Will Smith is great in this one, but he can't save this awful movie. Messy as hell."
" I love this Movie!!
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,8,Jared Leto is the best Joker EVER! Intimidating and slightly scary Joker character is how a bad guy is suppose to be.
" Worse editing I've seen in a movie
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,4,This film is like a bunch of college kids got together to make something cool. The editing is so abrupt and the story has many plot holes. I don't even know why they're making another one honestly.
" One of the best films
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,9,I loved this film. The cast is iconic and perfect and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is phenomenal. I don't know why so many people don't like it.
" I tried to like it
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,6,"Harley Quinn and Deadshot (maybe Flag too) were the lifesavers for the whole movie ! Others characters and the villains were totally forgettable! WB wasted Jared Leto's talent, his Joker was also forgettable!
#releasetheayercut"
" Not so bad
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,7,"Not sure why the ratings are down for this movie, it was kind of entertaining, a decent storyline, with some really good actors. It is a typical ""super heroes"" type film; only these are ""super baddies""! What more do you want film like this? It is very watchable. Perhaps OTT with the violence, but most films seem to be that way these days. Suicide Squad should have a better feedback then it is getting on this website."
" Entertaining and smart just needs...
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,6,They need to stop these quick cut money grabs. You need at least 3 hours to build characters and another hour to get into the action. Just rushed like most of these films. Use the AVENGERS model. Make separate films to develop these characters or make a trilogy out of the same plot line. Stop rushing and slow down the storytelling.
" So much so promise and so little delivered
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,3,"If you have to keep popping a joke in every 2 minutes, I don't think you have a very good script! This could have been a crazy good film but was just annoying! I watched it at the time it came out and it made me mad, re watched it recently whilst doing a DC marathon and it made me madder! It could have been like Watchman but it became a Luke warm take on supposed 'baddies' having their time to shine. Don't even get me started on how heavily this film is framed for the male gaze, it's insulting to everyone involved. To summarise, incredible cast, amazing graphics, soundtrack is 10/10, but feels like it was directed and written by a 14 year old adolescent who spends way too much time on the internet!"
" Awful
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,1,It's so desperately wants to be a guardians of the galaxy movie and it fails miserably
" boring
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,3,"Went into the movie expecting to be entrertained as in so bad it´s good type of way... however, it was just boring and bland. Nothing was funny enough, there was nothing substantial about the movie, too many ass shots, lame. i guess this could´ve worked but it just didn´t. Also, captain boomerang? anyways just cringe :D"
" Good movie with poor presentation
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,6,"Lack of intensity & character development , some pilot holes and some illogical moments in film. Good performance by jared leto, but joker absolutely do nothing into this movie.Captain boomerang & katana should have not be with the pack. Nothing was really shown about their abilities and ending was terrible because the villains doesn't look as strong as their look.There's some good moments, but not much. Overall this movie still consider enjoyable to watch, but not much, especially when you are a details person.Good movie with poor presentation"

" Decent movie
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,7,"The film was good, that's almost all I have to say. El Diablo's ark was amazing and executed perfectly. All of the actors were amazing, especially Jay Hernandez and Will Smith. The movie had it's bad and cringeworthy moments, but overall it was quite good."
" A bold decision for DC. It certainly delivered.
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,10,"David Ayer's Suicide Squad (2016) is a very enjoyable, very well effected movie. It's something DC has never done before until now, and every member of the ""Skwad"" are a treat. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, and others in the squad, well-received.In my personal opinion, more Joker please! Jared Leto needed more screen time, however, it should've been called 'Suicide Squad & the Joker' if Joker had a bigger role. The mission to save the world handled by the supervillains is absurdly great, something different and not very original really makes it work. And, not to mention, Killer Croc, was really handled well, rocking the hood just makes it just different and really interesting.The villain, could've slightly pulled it off better, but having the romantic between a hero and a villain is really cool, most couples in superhero movies are both the hero, but not in this film. Having Deadshot try to live up to the father he is supposed to be is executed well and it doesn't go over the top whilst trying to focus on the film's plot. The final battle is well-received and is enjoyable. Deadshot dreaming about killing Batman is excellent, just something new a hero's point of view. The film is about the villains, not the heroes. And that is so enjoyably great.Overall, the film is flawless and a great take for DC. Looking forward to The Suicide Squad in 2021.10/10."
" Almost fell asleep
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,3,"So many stars, action scenes, villains, bad ass guys and tough talk. Yet I almost fell asleep several times. A messy collection of events leading to anything but suspense or interest"
" Bad
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,5,"Don't watch this
It's a waste of your time
Acting is bad story I s bad
Just bad"
" Disappointed
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,6,"Joel Kinnaman is the worst actor of the bunch and yet it somehow focuses around his character the most. Really just ruins the movie, I hope his character is killed off quickly in the suicide squad. Faceless army of enemies a, a metahuman to be taken down by woman with a bat, guy a boomerang and some guns. It's just stupid, way too big of a scale for suicide squad."
" Better than people say, could have been amazing, but still disappointing. Spoilers within.
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,5,"The first third of the movie was great, surprising given the bad reviews. The build up and introduction of the characters was stylish, worked well, was fun, and was adult.It starts to change when they are getting changed into their mission clothes, the atmosphere lightens up, but not really in a good way, and the one-liners are a bit too staged as everything pauses while they are delivered not only here but also from here on in the movie.The mission they set out on quickly turns into bay-transformers-esque shooting and fighting which is a bit boring and cliched, and goes on for most of the remainder of the movie, interspersed with brief dialogues and plot points. Some tension manages to be created with the control that the mission leader has over them, but it's hard to take it seriously, especially when team member's like deadshot could have done away with the mission leader if they had wanted, what stops him? Morals?Morals and conscience are a truly interesting grey area here, in which the people in charge turn out to be if not as bad, then perhaps worse than the suicide squad themselves, which also raises the question of the team's obedience to such leaders. While there are discussions and intentions toward rebellion, they never really follow through, even at the end when all is said and done. Strangely the authority figure's criminal behaviour does not cause their authority to be questioned by the team, this especially applies at the end of the movie when the authority figure takes time off their jail sentences. It feels like Hitler telling some criminals they can be released early for good behaviour.The bar scene is missing some of the funny lines from the trailer, and Katana's decision to join them for a drink is an example of a 180 which makes no sense and doesn't get explained, and all the while they are drinking, soul-searching, and having their moral reckonings, the main 'evil' protagonist's world-crushing business gets conveniently paused.As to the joker, the role was done well despite people's disliking of this version, I can see how the actor didn't watch other versions in order to create their own, and they are convincing as a chilling, crazy, oddball villian. It was unusual to see the joker used in a love subplot, but this twisted infatuation was done okay, and was fairly entertaining.So overall don't expect clever plot points or everything to always make sense, don't expect satisfying fighting, though there are one or two interesting action pieces. The relationships are the most interesting part of the movie, and the team member's personal struggles end up being the most convincing thing about this fairly unconvincing movie, with Harley Quinn and Deadshot providing the most in this area, despite this Deadshot's acting is subdued, but Harley is believable. It is an antihero movie, and unapologetically unmoralistic, apart from that it follows some hollywood formulas, and could have been so much more, especially if it had kept the feel from the first third."
" Level of Dark Knight or the Avengers, but somehow people don't like it as much
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,4,"By the way, Joker here is much more authentic than Heath Ledger's Joker, he is how do i say it? *ucked in the head. Interesting scenes with Joker are here, but not in Dark Knight movie. Nice to see best Batman back, even for half of minute. Kinda childish boring movie."
" It's a great movie to it see
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,1,"Waited years to watch the suicide squad, just to be disappointed by the Joker.. will smith actually did a great job, the actress playing harlequin did ok, but all of the other characters, were just place holders, no one did anything really accept 3 characters, out of 7. so I guess, they were just there to support will, the worst joker ever and harlequin..... they did use the strangest character ever. A gang banger, that could harness fire, but his character was too type scripted to appreciate. I'm sure there's more to gang culture, than saying hey essay, let's have a cold beer. The witch and her brother were great concepts, but death of super humans with fight scenes is so 1977, I would rate this higher but the Joker killed it, I mean literally killed the joy of the character. Haven't seen that actor in any roles since, so"
" Very boring movie
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,4,"Very boring movie, even by the standards of movies by DC. As it is possible to shoot so boring and tiresome film with such cast I don't know. The movie is so not considerable that his principle it is possible even not to look, all the same he in general doesn't influence the Universe of DC in any way. Simply lost 2 hours, the only thing light in this movie is a Joker though he isn't enough (("
" Bad is good and good is bad.
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,7,"I haven't watched many DC characters so I had no expectations from most of them but I liked them. Having such powerful characters they could have made it into a masterpiece. There was no justice to the characters except Harley Quinn and Deadshot, others were not given so much explore. So overall it is a nice movie but does not fulfill expectations."
" It's not bad, it's horrible for sure !!!
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,5,"We were looking forward to this film and, when we watched it, our expectations were high, but with a bad story and unattractive charismatic characters, we have another disappointment from the DCEU!"
" Dont think about it
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,6,"RelaxMan this is one of those movies. You know your watching it and ur having a good time, it sure ain't boring but then you start think about what's going on on screen and you are like ""well that was dumb, and so was that ........... and that.......... so at the end if the day the movie does not have much going for it but is it fun HELL YEA. Look I got what I came for with this a cast with good chemistry and a cgi disposable army fight and some shady government mfs doing some shady government mfs things. Other than Harley Quinn and deadshot nobody has much personality but it's ok you forget about them halfway thought the film. At the end of the day just watch it and turn of your brain odds are you will have a fun time. Odds are you might cringe once or twice.6/10Dumb fun movie"
" they never cared about the hate
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,10,Im amazed about them not caring about the hate they were getting. but i will give this a straight up 10 for having Will Smith as Deadshot and winning awards while they were disliked. kudos to DC and Warner Bros
" #ReleaseTheAyerCut
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,4,This movie is horrible. Even though it has an extended cut. So I'd say they release the original vision of David Ayer for the movie.
" take this from someone who knows films
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,8,"I'm seriously not a fan of the dc marvel world at all but this film was honestly good. not great but good. the cast was great, the acting was great, and overall a good film! i don't understand the bad reviews and i also do not understand the bad reviews saying ""why are there good reviews"" because i see more bad reviews than good ones. watch this film!"
" Worst movie ever made
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,1,This is the worst movie ever made. Everyone involved should've been fired and sent back to working as baristas
" Not as horrible as I was expecting
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,5,Not as need-rage inducing as Man of Steel or Batman v Superman.It was mostly just boring.And Jared Leto looks stupid.
" Awful
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst movies I've ever watched. The story is incredibly boring, the screenplay is terrible and Leto's ''performance'' is an insult to Heath Ledger. A disgrace to Nolan. A blatant cash grab."
" This movie is sooo bad it's almost unbelievable it got made
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,1,"The point of making this movie is the first thing that is a mystery, I imagined something badly written but at least entertaining, ohhhhh I had underestimated the ability of movie makers of making things even worse, I didn't walk away in the middle of the movie because I thought it could get not terrible at some point and paid money for it, good money, but it didn't, I don't remember the end because by then I was reading my email, so so bad.They took a bad story and made it so much worse, the plot is about a government agent played by Viola Davis that for some reason thinks is a good idea to hire criminals because heroes are no longer available in case a crisis arrives and of course hiring the criminals is what causes the crisis that now have to fight in a pointless way. So it's all about the hired criminals fighting the other hired criminals to save something??? Who knows, who cares !!!"
" Deception at its finest
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,1,Not one person committed suicide. The title makes no sense.
" If ever a movie stumbled in the delivery of promised greatness, it was surely this one. Unmissable !
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,8,"A strong and confident beginning establishes characters, structure, and seeds the outline of a great story. The flaws appear quite early on though and lie in the chemistry between the anti-heroes. The mix isn't quite right, and causes the plot to become muddied and confused. Like mixing ingredients in a cake, the wrong combination of flavours confuses the pallete, and ruins what might otherwise have been delicious. Some characters work, and others don't fare so well. Harley Quinn, and Joker with their 'twisted' partnership have sensational possibilities, only partially explored, and all the better for it. Deadshot mis-casts Will-Smith and brings a baggage of conflicted morality that does not rhyme with the overall theme. Katana and Croc just don't seem to fit anywhere convincing, while Rick Flag's character, was both mis-cast and under-developed. El Diablo's potential was under-used, while the Enchantress and Amanda Waller both make strong starts that are defeated by weaknesses in the script and plot. Given the sheer number of characters, it's no surprise the result was a bit of a puddle. Hopefully a re-boot can revive the best elements that were only kindled here, and give them a chance to achieve the glory they are probably capable of. If ever a movie stumbled in the delivery of promised greatness, it was surely this one."
" This is my favorite movie
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie
it's funny, thrilling and good. i know it's maybe a little weird, but i love the characters and especially Harley Quinn and the Joker.
it's worth seeing!!!"
" Nothing of value found in this movie.
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,1,I created an account just to give this dumpster fire a 1/10. I went into this really wanting to like this movie but holy hell did they make that impossible.
" Watch the extended version
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,8,"I hated the original release. It just felt like a complete mess. There was no clear plot, just scenes. Many of those scenes and interactions were very cool but everything seemed underdeveloped. The plot was quickly lost and character motivations were unclear. I saw that movie 4 years ago and now I'm watching the extended version and it turned into a really cool movie. I don't know exactly the differences between this and the original as my viewings were too far between but I had no trouble following the plot. The main characters all got to shine and all got proper background and motivation. If this was how the movie was originally released it would have been the most fun movie of the year. Tie that together with the director's cut of Batman vs Superman that I also enjoyed (though I already enjoyed the original), the Zack Snyder Cut of Justice League that's coming and I'm excited again for the DC universe."
" Suicide Squad
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,1,It was one of the most excited movies to watch in 2016 but I was very disappointed. The story was bad and the film was very bad and the movie tries to cram the comedy into the movie. The actors 'performance was average. Margot Robbie. I cannot imagine Harley Quinn in acting. Another actress.
" Unfortunately the core of this movie fails likes many DC movies before at the balance of power
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,7,"Unfortunately the core of this movie fails likes many DC movies before at the balance of power and ability of different characters, which renders the believability null and void.On the face of it Suicide Squad provides us with a well cast and acted film, great looking spectacle (apart from design of Killer Croc and the effects of the hovering and glowing Doctor in the final third) and some decent sound bites as well as a very modern take on soundtracking which for the most part in this type pf movie works well.However the way the bad guy is weakly introduced (why did she snap the head off the figure in the cave? makes no sense) and her relationship with flag, doesn't give us anything to care for.The biggest issue for me is the balance of power between the characters. We have an all powerful god capable of creating an army and tearing the world apart and she's outfoxed by a group of criminals who whilst are exceptional and crazy do not have superpowers. It makes no sense. Every scene with the enchantress is the weakest part of the movie.I personally feels had the bad guy been more down to earth a real gem of a movie could have been made, that being said it is watchable and entertaining, just disappointing."
" Cool movie, I liked it. Trlica they pereborshil with special effects especially at the end. And the Joker would like much more.

" WORST MOVIE EVER!!!
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,1,"WORST MOVIE EVER, the whole story makes no sense at all!!!!!!"
" With so much potential, great characters and actors surely this was a certain win? Sadly no, the writers, producers and director manage to balls it up
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,3,"The summary of this review is its title.I've watched Suicide Squad (2016) twice now. The first time shortly after its release, and the second time just now. I was hoping I had misjudged it the first time, but no, this really is a porridge and carries the hallmarks of a low budget film.The good and the bad:
It's suicide squad! A group of non-hero 'cool' characters put together to fight evil.The cast is fantastic and doesn't require a great deal of versatile acting skillDeadeye is a 'cool' character and in the main carried the movie for meMidway in it starts to become a chaotic mess where too much is going onDue to the last point, I was bored and feverishly hit the handy 'fast forward 10 seconds' button in Prime VideoWith a new Suicide Squad (2021) movie coming out soon, I am hopeful it will be an improvement on this attempt... but we will see.In the meantime, anyone who hasn't seen Suicide Squad (2016) and are looking for a group type hero film. Don't bother with this."
" Underrated
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,7,"This film feels like it's being directed by a kid who watches a lot of super hero films but I think that's what makes it to me stand out from many of the other dc films. There are some ways I can prove this here is an example. They do a short scene telling us all about the squad and what they specialise. But then out of nowhere in the last three seconds before the heist is about to begin they throw in this guy who can climb walls who dies before he even gets to fight any enemy's
. Another thing about this film is that if the filmmakers had just kept this a normal heist and didn't add in this extremely bad villain who wants to take over the world an is a witch with bad graphics and just no need for it. Also the film needed more development on the characters as I felt like by the end I didn't fully understand them.Even after all those faults I feel that people should still give this film a chance as it is actually great and like I've said for my title of this review it is extremely underrated and not appreciated as much as it should be."
" Suicide Squad
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,8,"The story is plain and simple which is what the film needed with such a large cast and the villain was a great choice. If you enjoy a good action film with interesting characters you will enjoy this film.
You do get a good amount of Harley Quinn and Deadshot, which is nothing to complain about as they're also both great characters."
" jared letto was the best
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,4,"Yes ok i said it hate me.but this guy jared leto was the best joker among all after jack nicholson compared to the all others ive seen all others in other batman movies and they all suck and they are the worst plus they overact as for joker the character expresses itself/himself alot and its a overrated cheap nonsense stupid character why people love it and at least this guy jared letto made it work in his own way and made it funny ,so why this guy gets hate as a actor jared leto did his job .better then so called heath ledger and joaquin pheonix .those two were the worst and still keep getting oscars why after their death and this movie is not bad its good i don't care what anybody says suicide squad was fun.my rating is 4/10."
" As a movie, it's not bad
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,7,"There's a lot of bitterness here over how the movie does not fulfill the DCU canon. But as someone who never read the comic books and doesn't care about the how true the movie is to the DCU, it's not a bad movie.In the movie the real villains are Waller and the rest of the US government. They're corrupt and far more ruthless than the Suicide Squad. In fact, the Squad are mainly victims of people like Waller. Seen this way, the characterizations of Deadshot, Quinn, and the others are true to the premise of the movie. Deadshot is not a cold-blooded assassin, he's somebody who's simply trying to survive the best way he can in this world and keep his daughter safe. The same for Diablo. Quinn is a bit different, she was created by the Joker who couldn't care less about her. While the Joker subplot is a distraction at times it serves the story of Quinn freeing herself from him and becoming her own person, the same as all the others who are trying to free themselves in this society.The action and story move forward in a straightforward way. I didn't find it muddled or confusing at all. It's standard fare for a superhero movie but it serves the plot. It moves the characters along.It took me a long time to watch this movie because of all the bad reviews it got. And since the movie was obviously marketed to DCU fans I understand the disappointment. It was a cynical ploy by the studio. But even so the movie still stands as an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours -- if you don't come with preconceptions."
" 3hrs Would Have Done This Story Justice
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,6,"Suicide Squad is a highly underrated movie that tells the story of a group of criminals known as ""meta humans"" who are given an option of a reduced sentence (and their life) if they choose to help fight for the united states in the foreign affairs. The only problem is that these foreign affairs are not of human decent. In a world that now has no Superman a group of powerful people must form to help defend the planet.In my own opinion, people don't like this movie because of its comedic relief and since of ""cheese"", I think a movie like this is great because it stands out in the rest of the DC Universe, a universe that is becoming more and more dark. A movie with ALOT of interesting story lines and a new view at some familiar faces is refreshing.One note that I think could have made this movie better was to simply make it longer, this could have easily been a three hour movie. This would have allowed for a much deeper character development that didn't really exist in this movie. So many great stories rest behind these ""heroes"" that could all have their own movie, a little bit more time invested into their background I believe would have done DC well."
" I saw it on release
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,1,"And I thought it was a pretty bad movie. With the all start cast I was expecting something mindblowing that never arrived. Watched it again today, thinking that maybe it was the wrong day, time or whatever. Nope, it is really a terrible movie in every way. If I was to list why, another webste would be needed."
" Bruh no wtf is this nonsense
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,2,This movie is so horrible it's not funny. I want to absolutely bash every single character in this movie in the face with a bat. I mean even the rather attractive Mrs Robbie couldn't save this terrible movie. Jared Leto also usually a pre g actor man but his joker made me wanna tear my eye balls out. Absolutely dreadful experience watching this movie.
" Harley Quinn saves the film
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,6,"Here we have a film that suffers from really poor writing, some uninteresting characters played by average actors but it was saved by Harley Quinn played wonderfully by Margot Robbie. Quinn steals the show and was the most accurate portrayal of a comic book character outside animated stuff and video games. This film also had Will Smith as Deadshot who was fine and Jared Leto's Joker was an absolute mess. Ther action scenes were fun but it could have been so much better with better writing and a stronger villain"
" If your 9 years old you're going to love this
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,1,This movie is just a really long hot topic commercial for 9 year olds who can't wait to be an edgy teenager. Half of the movie is flashy character introductions and the second half is the revealing of a weak plot line. There are episodes of blues clues with more character development and suspense than this.
" I liked it. Unfortunately in IMDB there are a lot of trolls.
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,8,"Why people hate themselves so much? I know you can't look at you in a mirror, because you don't like yourself, but please don't blame the others for your bad life, that's your responsibility.
Criticizing and judging the others is the only thing you're able to do, you're just wasting your poor life and that's stupid as you have only one.
Saying you're good in critics is even more idiotic than saying to not watch this movie.
I'm glad I watched this movie, so I didn't miss the opportunity of having some fun and I enjoyed almost everything. I'm a person who tries to find something good in what the others think that it's only bad. I know you don't have any idea about the meaning of the Tao sign, Yin and Yang... I'll be trying to explain you something even if I know you won't be able to understand... a big black part with a small white ball means that even if you can think that everything is bad, there's always something good, sometimes very tiny, but the other big part is white with a small black ball and the meaning is that even if apparently everything is good, there's something bad and you have to choose what to do... in your case, you decided to look just at the big black part and you didn't see that small white ball, because you're full of hate and anger. I watched the big white part conscious that not everything is good and I enjoyed the movie, you just hated everything and you didn't understand that in the end you were the only who felt bad... after reading the word end, you were furious, angry and probably you started complaining for everything... poor guys, I'm really sorry for you.For the other people... I'm not saying that it's a fantastic movie, but it's worth of being watched if you like the genre, of course.
I'm sure you can have some fun and there are a lot of good actors, the pace is as it should be, directing is good and the acting won't disappoint you.
Don't let be swayed by the bad reviews, watch the movie!"
" It's a Fun DC movie
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,8,Not sure why people hate this movie so much?? I thought it was fun and entertaining! Enjoyed Will Smith's character he was funny. And of course Harley Quinn stole the show.Give it a fair chance. And do yourself a favor ... stop comparing DC and Marvel. 2 different brands.
" Margot Robbie is worth a star
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,1,"If you thought Batman vs Superman was bad, then you'll need to brace yourself for this terrible mess!Slow motion gun tossing and painfully boring action scenes tacked onto an excessive amount of walking on screen.Margot Robbie deserves a star for that outfit. Her character wasn't nearly as nutty as it should have been though."
" Horse baloney
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,1,"By far one of the worst movies ever made, not even exaggerating."
" One of the worst superhero movies
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,2,"Failure has a thousand fathers, but I don't think you could ever excuse David Ayer from the dumpster fire that is Suicide Squad. Yes, the stories of Warner Brothers getting different editing houses to compete over the edit and a commercial editing firm won to help make the movie a near completely incomprehensible mess, but I don't think that the editing mess can really hide the fact that this is a movie that tried too much in too short a time. Would a longer, cleaner cut improve things? Probably, but there's still the fact that the central idea never rises above really dumb.So, Superman has arrived and died. The world knows that metahumans exist and Amanda Waller has a plan. She's going to take several of the worst people in prison, some with special abilities some without, and put them into a group to go after bad weird things. Sort of. She's confident she can do it because she knows how to get people to act outside of their self-interest, though she never really demonstrates that beyond planting bombs in people's necks ala Escape from New York. She never really seems to be in control of anything.So, the squad is made up of Deadshot who never misses when he uses a gun, El Diablo who can make fire with his hands, Killer Croc who is a big reptilian guy, the Enchantress who is a malevolent spirit that has possessed a young doctor lady, Captain Boomerang who, um..., throws a boomerang, and Harley Quinn who is, um..., pretty and psychotic. The group doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but whatever. They're bad, and I guess that's all that matters, though they all have soft spots designed to make them appealing to the audience which makes them much less bad.The first half or so of the movie is cut up terribly. We get a couple of minute scenes, all set to different styles of music, trying to cutely introduce each character including on screen text to supply extra information. It never settles into any kind of narrative groove, choosing to instead jump from one character to another inelegantly at best. This is all doled out as Waller explains her plan to some kind of superior over dinner. Eventually, the whole stupidity of the situation becomes evident with the malevolent spirit Enchantress easily escapes her bonds, frees her brother's spirit, and they join together to try and destroy the world. I mean, if Waller had never had her stupid plan, none of this would have happened. The lax security around the Enchantress's brother's little statue that held his soul is just icing on the cake, I guess. None of this gets fixed with another cut. The stupidity is at the core of the story.So, with the Enchantress and her brother going all blue beam in the sky in the middle of Midway City, the Suicide Squad is called up to go in and rescue a VIP. The stakes and very point of this mission are super unclear for a while, and kind of confusing. We have our super villain team up and they're...not going to the blue beam in the sky? They're...walking to a building for an operation that ends...in a helicopter pickup? See, this is really, really stupid. A new cut will not fix this.So, they get to the VIP, and it's Waller who's just so bad that she kills a bunch of her aides after she's rescued. See?! There's little difference between good and bad! Plus Deadshot has a cute daughter! It's dumb. It's really dumb. So, the Suicide Squad then decides that they're going to save the world, and we get some big special effects scenes and the movie finally comes to a merciful end.This movie is broken fundamentally, and it's kind of sad to see. David Ayer started out well with End of Watch and Fury, but he's proven himself to be creatively bankrupt ever since. Between this and Bright, he's got little of the spark that seemed to make him a promising director from the beginning. There's no denying that Warner Brothers messed with this, taking it from Ayers' hands in post-production. Maybe another cut could help save the first half, but the second half is still defined by nearly impossible to discern action sequences because they're filmed so darkly, an incredibly stupid plot driven by incredibly stupid characters, and a shockingly aimless narrative drive. Oh, and the Joker is a complete waste of space with Jared Leto being allowed to go off the deep end to little actual effect.This is one of the worst superhero movies ever made. And, I repeat an alternate cut would only fix so much of it. This movie is a disaster that Warner Brothers just made worse. They started meddling with Batman V Superman and wouldn't stop until after Justice League. I swear, if you're going to hire a guy to write and direct a $150-$200 million movie, make sure you're happy with your choice before he starts filming. If he's in the editing bay, don't try to rework everything. It never comes out well."

" Worst comic book movie I've ever seen
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,2,"There is no worse comic book movie in my opinion, I would watch anything over this. There are no likable characters, the joker is lame, and harlequin is cringey. The villain is just thrown in there, I bont know anything about him, and hes not even interesting enough for me to want to know more about him. The thing that makes a comic book movie for me is the villain, and I hate it when they just throw one in there we dont get to know or understand. I hate this movie"
" Another wasted potential
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,2,"In the long line of lackluster films comes this joyless cash grab. A weak plot and mostly unloveable characters drags out this two hour charade. It is flanked by an emaciated Jared Leto as the Joker and Robie Margot as Harley Quinn, a woman suffering from Stockholm syndrome. The movie seemed to serve one purpose: the excuse for every crazy ex-girlfriend to dress up with pigtails and sport a baseball bat."

Literally 99% of everything in screen, said, filmed, scripted, cinematography, sound track is all page one, sentence one, from the ""I'm so cool it hurts rule book""The good. Jai Courtenay, yes I know, inexplicably he is the best thing in the movie. Margot Robbie is wasted as Harley. Diablo could of been cool if his character was given any room to grow or not be jam packed with clichésThe Bad. The restThe worst. The talented cast being utterly wasted on this steaming burlap sack of dog turdsThe beyond worst. Cara Delevingne, how in the name of Stanley Kubrick does this women land movie roles?!? Oh, other than being a model and having ""connections"" watching her trying to emote, or convey emotion, or show pain, or anything, everything she does is a travesty to acting.Avoid this film at all costs"
" Absolutely terrible

" Colossal boring trainwreck
",2020-09-01 00:00:00,2,"I read the premise and read the reviews when this film came out, so I decided to give it a pass. Nothing about it captured my interest.Then tonight (August 2020), a good friend said that he watched it recently and that I should check it. ""Great film,"" he said. I will not trust his film recommendations again.From start to finish, there was not a single redeeming element to this film. Not a shred of anything even remotely interesing. Not the premise. Certainly not the characters. And the script was a tattered collage of disconnected boringness.The first part of the film (initial 30 minutes or so) introduces us to the bad guys (well, to most of them) and gives us a little peek into their past: how they got caught or how they went bad or how they blah blah who cares?This beginning was just too long-winded and uninteresting. I wanted to turn it off, but I persevered.After that, the film just becomes your run-of-the-mill film about getting from Point A to Point B with a few obstacles thrown in the way. Who cares? I gave it two stars instead of just one because you get to see Will Smith's amazing sweaty chest in the beginning. Rawr."
" Disappointing for such a great cast
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,4,I was really looking forward to seeing this but felt a bit like I did after season 8 of game of thrones... I wish they hadn't bothered. I did love Harley Quinn and the joker in this though (only to be disappointed later down the line by birds of prey)

" Not as bad?
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,6,It wasn't as bad as what people say but it wasn't great. It had a simple plot but enjoyed the jokes between each character. Give it a watch but don't think its going to be an amazing movie.

" Supernatural threat is destroying the entire world, better send a psychiatrist with a baseball bat
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,3,"I have too many questions. Why does an archeologist destroy an artifact as soon as she finds it? Who thinks the suicide squad is a good idea? Why would anyone think the suicide squad would co-operate with each other or their mission leader? Why would anyone think they could fight against Superman? Who can care about so many characters? In particular, who is interested in someone who can throw boomerangs, a crocodile man, a sword ""that traps the souls of its victims"" (what the hell does that mean?), someone who can climb walls and so on? What's so interesting or compelling about the enchantress as a villain? Why do they even attempt to control her? Why does she have barely any oversight? How do the characters keep surviving helicopter crashes? Why does Deadshot think that the officials will stick to their word if he makes a deal? Who feels threatened by the uncompelling CGI generic monster army? Why does nobody think it's a bad idea to set the whole building on fire? Why does setting the building on fire have no consequences? Why do the suicide squad agree to continue the mission even after they are freed? Why does El Diablo consider them ""family"" even though he has just met them? This whole thing is held together only by Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Deadshot (Will Smith) and El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) who aren't given much to work with but do their best at salvaging this wreck."
" You think Batman v Superman sucked???

" Not as bad as most people may realize!!!
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,4,"Suicide Squad wasn't horrible but it has it's flaws. Lt's start with the good stuff because there is a lot of good stuff in here believe it or not. Let's talk about the flashback scenes. Both of them I thought were very good. In the first one with Harley Quinn and Joker I thought was very well done with Joker psychologically tormenting Harley and she end up falling in love with him. At first I loved Jared Leto's Joker I thought he was really good but we'll talk about him later. I loved the scenes with Joker denying Harley I thought they were really good. Next let's talk about the flash back scene with Deadshot. I thought it was really good. His daughter came between her and Batman. Basically Batman was about to take Deadshot in and he had a chance to shoot Batman but his daughter stepped in front of Batman and he had a choice to do it in front of his daughter or set the right example, and in the end the police captured him hugging his daughter handcuffed to a fence. I thought that was really heartbreaking and good. Well that was the only good things to talk about now let's move on to the bad stuff. Lets talk about the plot first it was pretty bad and seemed very Marvelish. Basically this witch is reaking havoc on a city and this team is sent out there to stop her called the suicide squad. Keep in mind the Justice League was formed already while this was going on. Couldn't they have just called them, no the call a guy who can shoot things and a girl with a bat and a giant crocodile. Now let's talk about character development, they only develop two characters, Deadshot and Harley Quinn they never think to develop any more character. There are some really good ones, for instance Killer Croc who suffered a skin disease and people treated him like a monster so he acted like a monster. There is some really good potential for character development but no he is the big strong guy of the team. Now lets talk about what everyone is talking about in this movie. Jared Leto as the joker. Is absolutely horrible. Everyone he talks to it seems like he wants to assault them and not by hitting them or punching them. His laugh sounds like he's having an asthma attack. In the trailer it seemed like he was going to be the villain which I would have liked. But he's not its this witch. What they should have done is sent them to go fight with this terrorist group or something because that is what they did in the comics. All in all this is not a very good movie but if your a massive fan then maybe you will have some fun."
" How did they get it so wrong?
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,5,"Suicide Squad is nothing other than a missed opportunity - a sequence of shallow character pieces and music videos that lacks any screenwriting depth.In the run up to this movie, we were inundated with footage of Jared Leto's Joker and Margot Robbie's Harlequin in tantalising shots of tension and romantic disarray. Leto is hardly in this movie and while Margot Robbie is the one saving grace of this entire endeavour, the rest of the movie makes no sense.Rumours suggest that David Ayer's vision was cut short by studio pressure and if this is the case, then that is a travesty, as this film is a let-down for DC fans across the globe.The film insists on trying to tell too much. It results in a shallow depiction of what this film should have been and while the Affleck cameo is nice, the car-crash of a second half leaves you wanting a refund.At least WB are getting James Gunn in to redo this - fingers crossed it will wash the taste of this film out of our mouths and we can all just move on. In saying that, I can't help but feel that Ayer should get a chance to show his vision to the world - Leto and all. Fingers crossed, we can get a David Ayer cut further down the line - as this version that we currently get (along with the extended cut), is just not good enough. May the Snyder Cut pave the way for more directors getting their say."
" Kiss ass - DC style
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,5,"A ruthless US government covert operations specialist (Viola Davis) comes up with the wild idea of putting together a team of super villains to take on an evil ancient witch (Cara Delevingne) and The Joker (Jared Leto) who have laid waste to Chicago. Those after them are a bunch of dangerous hombres, especially Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) who used to be The Joker's lover.The DC universe directly challenges Marvel's AVENGERS universe here and is much more violent in the process. The action is well handled by talented director David Ayer, better known for his corrupt cop dramas, as the writer for TRAINING DAY (2001) and directing and writing STREET KINGS (2008) and END OF WATCH (2013), but handles the violence well here. Davis too is chilling in her matter of fact, cool and frankly very ordinary character. Meanwhile, Robbie's Harley Quinn is sexy, wild and gives off a good deal of energy and wit, while Will Smith's assassin centres the film and the characters. Leto as a punk ass Joker is simply irritating and the less screen time he has the better."
" What did I just watch?
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,2,"I am definitely too old (51) for this kind of garbage for a movie. The only time I would lift my eyes from the boring game I wa playing on my smartphone was when Margot showed up, but not even her in Victoria's Secret lingerie could have saved this horrible piece of junk for a movie."
" Disappointing
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,3,"Boring, predictable, with unlikable characters. In all honesty I only watched it for Joker and Harley, their story was unusually loving and cute in this one, that's the good side of the movie, everything else is absolute crap."
" See it if you are a DC fan
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,6,The only reason to see Suicide Squad is so you are in sync with all the DC movies that's going to release.Nothing much amazing about it.
" Solid 7
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,7,For me the visuals and the humour made up for the weak story !!!
" GREAT MOVIE
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,8,"It's a great movie, my only problem is that there are to many stories going on at once! But over all it's a MUST WATCH for me! 👍🏼"
" It's simply the worst nanananaaaaaaaaaaaa
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,1,The worst movie ever released under the DCEU brand...and that says something. Avoid at all costs.
" Amazing trailer, but a sad movie
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,3,"DC Comics had the opportunity to explore a new side of the villains introducing the suicide squad, it one that was based on HQ series, but as Batman vs Superman, it was a disaster.
After a nice opening introducing with a very special Queen's song and interesting cut scenes, they barely failed with presenting a non-sense movie story. It's look like that the Villains become friends and good people and want to ""save"" the world, losing that aspect that they are murders, psychopath, thief and etc...
They could explore better the darkside of the government, the Joker as a Villian and the intelligence of the characters.
When the movie ends you will still waiting for the movie that was showed In the trailer."
" Its Difficult to dislike this movie
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,8,"Great movie
Margot Robbie, Magnificent, Amazing, etc ,no word to describe her in this movie."
" Cool, but not good
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,5,"Because I like how Harley Quinn was written overall, how she looks of course and Margot is great... but also she has too many cringy moments/lines.
Because Smith is always cool, but he plays the most cliche and boring character in the movie.
Because I liked the Mtv introductions but not all the characters.
Because Cara Delevigne is beautiful, but her character/villain shallow and weak.
Because I liked Jared Leto and I wanted more. And sometimes I wanted less.
Because the plot has some great things but also wastes a lot of potential.
Because I loved every second of Diablo, but his role was minimal.I enjoy the movie, more or less, but it is not good."
" Another example of a terrible DC movie
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,4,"So the premise of the movie is - when there are no superheroes left (namely, Superman) to save/protect the world, we should assemble a team of hot-headed bad guys to do the job. Just inject them with an explosive tracking device and we're set - what can go wrong, right?
Oh, and apparently you just need a smartphone app to blow their heads off that you occasionally wave in their face to motivate them.While the cast of the movie includes some prominent well-known names, the ensemble of their characters just doesn't work because of the poor writing.The whole saga can be encapsulated within a few points:
storyline, plot - nonsensical and barely any to speak of;characters - borrowed from a stash of stereotypical anti-heroes, also no development of their story-archs (a few flashback scenes at random times doesn't cut it);dialogues - almost unbearable and filled with one-liner clichés;Harley-Joker love (?) saga included just because we needed some weird abusive romance in this mess as well?soundtrack - feels more like a mix-tape of songs that play at random times without any regard to what happens on the screen.All that combined amounts to an epic disaster, which to me felt more like a parody of a movie; or rather several movie trailers and teasers stitched together.So until DC gets their act together and work on a coherent storyline in their Universe, this disaster won't be their last."
" Not as bad as people say
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,10,It's predictable but lighthearted and ace soundtrack.
" Fun time with plenty of lols
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,7,"I honestly do not understand why this movie got all the bad reviews. Can't understand for the life of me. I guess some people want the DCEU to be more like the MCU? To that I ask,, why?!? I would prefer a difference.Now,, do I have a few complaints about this movie,, well yeah. I do have a few,, but I'll get to that later.This movie introduces us to a lot of characters we haven't seen on the big screen - Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Diablo, Capt Boomerang, Katana, and the Enchantress. (If any of those characters have been in a live action movie it's news to me) Will Smith kills it as Deadshot (pun intended). I hope he comes back for the 3rd movie. Margot Robbie was obviously born to play the role of Harley Quinn. She just becomes the character. Kinnaman was great as Rick Flagg, and all the other characters were played good as well.
Davis as Amanda Waller,,, holy crap!!! (No surprise though,, she is an Oscar winning actress) Like Deadshot says in the movie,, she is just a mean, mean lady. Cold as they come!!
Of courrse,, can't leave out Affleck as Batman. He makes a few short appearances. (I was among the group of people who were displeased upon hearing he was cast as Batman in BvS:Dawn of Justice. I did, however, trust Snyder, having seen all of his previous work,, and I was incredibly pleased with Afflecks performance as the Caped Crusader. As a matter of fact,, imo he is the #2 performance of the character(Bale and Keaton are tied for the #1 spot).) Also,, Leto!!! I realize I'm in the minority here,, but I enjoyed Leto's portrayal of Joker,,, and I wanted MORE!!!!!!!!!!
For those who expected more of Ledger's portrayal,, what were you thinking?!? Different universe!!! Also,, why would you want the same thing again?!? Leto did a great job of being over the top weird and crazy! I want to see him again,,,Now onto the complaints,, well, like I said, I wanted more of the Joker. Other than that,, there was one scene towards the end where things are going in slow motion. I like that things are building up to a climax in slow motion,,, it was just a little too slow. Needed to be going a lil bit faster than it was. It's forgivable,, but it still irks me every time I watch the movie.And that's pretty much it.So go watch it!!!!"
" Just a mess
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,4,Suicide Squad is a huge missed opportunity! The film seems to only focus on Harley and Deadshot while the other characters are just there in the background. The plot is very messy and some of the characters choices are kinda dumb. Enchantress is a terrible villain I don't know her motive or what her powers are. The pacing in this film is not good either. On the plus side of things Deadshot and Harley are good characters but other than that Suicide Squad has nothing else going for it.
" Watch it for harley quinn
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,6,"The highlight of suicide squad is none other than margot robbie as harley quinn. She is funny, insane, badass and damn SEXY. She could even overshadow a big superstar like will smith (it won't be a surprise if you forget that there was will smith after watching the movie).
But thats it. The story has nothing new to offer, script was below average, there is no character development apart from deadshot and harley quinn, no chemistry among the team and jared leto's joker was nothing but a pain in your eyes but still he could be forgiven because his character wasn't really important in the story. Batman's cameo also doesn't make it any special.
Despite all these flaws, suicide squad was a passable entertainer which does not bore you at all. Just watch without expecting too much."
" would give it a 0 if that was allowed
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,1,Just a bad film. worst thing i've ever watched. you can look at this account and see I have been using IMDB for 8 years or so and not once ever cared to write a review. just need someone to know how terrible this movie is.
" For the brain-dead masses
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,1,I am not going to go deep in to why this movie is terrible. Just know that there basically is no plot here. I had hope going in with something that was said in one of the earlier scenes but they trashed that idea and went with something that makes no sense. This movie is a giant plot hole and shouldn't exist. The writers and anyone else in the creative end of this trash should never be allowed near a movie again.
" One of the Most Under-rated Movies
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,8,"This is one of the few movies I've watched in a long time where I didn't have to pause it half way through due to boredom. Anyone saying there are no memorable characters are in pure denial. With all the girls dressing up as Suicide Squad's Harley Quinn and so many guys using Suicide Squad's Joker as their profile pic, those characters will not be forgotten for years to come. I know a lot get annoyed between bouncing from backstories to story to action constantly but I love it. I love backstories to characters, and following storyline that lead to action. I hate most action movies because there isn't enough of a backstory or storyline in them. In ways this reminds me of the whole A Nightmare on Elm Street. You had a story not just a horror movie. Freddy was funny not silent like Jason. And we got reminded of his backstory as well. So we knew why he was the way he was. And the only thing to me Suicide Squad missed was more gruesome humor."
" Good makeup and Margot Robbie's performance brings life into this mess
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,8,"I hate to say this but this film has limited but some good points. the first one is the makeup. Now i know you might think it didn't deserve the oscar but, personally, i think it was deserved. now if films like Florence Foster Jenkins,Jackie or Deadpool where nominated i probably would give it to Jackie. But this would be a close second. Secondly Margot Robbie's performance. She outshines herself as Harley Quinn. She was born to play that role. Now it isn't Oscar worthy (Ha Ha) but she makes this film enjoyable. Other than that it has a good cast and good original songs. Otherwise its a very weak film."
" Little more than a jumbled mess
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,1,"Suicide Squad
2016
Little more than a jumbled mess, Suicide Squad will hurt your head if you actually try sitting and watching it for more than five minutes at a time. There is no real story, absolutely no character development, a script that serves more as a series of one liners, and editing that is non-existent. This movie is just a series of music videos that were strewn together with absolutely no regard for a plot.
What if Superman was bad? Who would fight him? Amanda Waller has that figured out
with Task Force X, a group of highly skilled and metahuman convicts. Now, with a terrorist incident and no one else to turn to, the Suicide Squad is sent in to save the day.
Let me just say that I really wanted to like this movie. After the atrocity that was Batman
v Superman, I was really hoping that DC could redeem themselves with this, their next comic book movie. I was so wrong. If you have never read any Suicide Squad comics or DC comics in general you are already hopelessly lost here, because the characters aren't exactly top tier. Take Captain Boomerang for example. If you didn't know who he was before, you sure don't know who he is by the end of this movie. But this isn't the only pitfall for this flick, it is actually just one of many. How about the lack of a script? No problem for this director who was also the writer, just play some music and have the actors do random things. This movie was so terrible.
The only thing actually watchable was Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Maybe skip this movie and go straight to Birds of Prey."
" Not all expected.
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,7,"All expested a lot from this film, trailer looked awesome, but the film has some problems. Firstly, the plot is good, it shows the squad of criminals with dome superpowers or big abilities. Some acts of characters are illogical, and can't be understood. Secondly, the cast is great, all actors are wonderful, Margo Robbie is a brilliant of film. But some characters don't have any explanation. Joker is supporting character, and I don't understand it. Thirdly, the visual effects are good.
So, it's good action film for one time."
" Suicide squad
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,7,"Y'know I didn't hate this like everyone in the world seems to. The characters were colorful, big. I guess it's a tough task to get them all equal screen time. My suggestion would have been to cut back on the members. Problem solved.It doesn't quite have the fun of the trailer, which can happen when someone not involved with film cuts something that may not represent the film.Harley Quinn obviously a stand out, but the BIG ONE for me, was seeing Batman, albeit briefly. Just enough to tantalize. Wetted my appetite for his solo film which can't come soon enough."
" Dont waste your time
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,1,I've never seen a worse film. Just...wow! Literally pick anything in the film - it's off
" Not worthy to be called a movie even
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,1,"What the hell is this? I can't believe that people have actually taken the time to create such garbage.
The only organic thing we see on screen are the people. The rest is one big carnaval.
Constant flashes of lights and noise, it was pure torture watching this. All I was left with was a terrible headache.
Save your time, or it will be two hours of your life wasted that will never come back."
" REALLY FANTASTIC!!
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,10,This movie is great! Yes there are parts you may questions such as enchantress. She is the villain and there are some goofy things but honestly it's part of the character as well. If you watch this movie as a DC fan sure you can pick things you don't like..such as..I think killer croc should be more like he is in the animated series. You have Harley and Deadshot who kill it. Yes the actors are a big part of it but watch it for entertainment and you will be fine! Stop over analyzing and enjoy.
" Not a bad movie, needed more joker
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,6,"Let's be honest we were all expecting to see more of jared Leto as the joker in this movie but what we did see I loved! I hope he gets his own movie.But overall the movie was a good film, good action but tryed little to hard to be funny.Margot robbie and will Smith were great!"
" Disappointing
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,3,"I was so incredibly disappointed with this movie. Almost the entire cast was amazing, and it had so much potential, but this film just fell short in so many ways. The premise was pretty interesting: the stereotypical bad guys team up to save the world. But boy oh boy does it just flat out stray into stupid sci-fi territory. It gets to a point where the story is just ruined and makes no logical sense at all; it's borderline not even entertaining. If I hadn't payed three bucks to rent this trainwreck, I would've stopped watching about halfway into the movie. Margot Robbie and Will Smith had their talents truly wasted with this one. The only thing really redeeming this movie in the slightest is the cast itself and the characters' boo-hoo backstories, which are the only slightly interesting things there are to witness in this film. With that set aside, the script is boring, the action sequences are laughable, and again, the story is just downright outrageous to the point where it's no longer interesting. I was really looking forward to seeing the bad guys save the world, but it ended up just being another disappointment."
" Awful Plot of a Movie Saved By Harley Quinn
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,6,"I really don't get Hollywood sometimes.Why always prioritize big name actors and special effects? If you want a good movie shouldn't priority number one ALWAYS be hire a good screenwriter.A movie without a good plot will inevitably fail, no matter how big the actors' names are or how great the special effects and action sequences are, not that those elements are unnecessary. Often these days they are. But they still need a story.Here the story concept was actually a good idea (as in the comics) and the actors, especially scene stealing Margot Robbie, did well bringing the iconic characters to life, but the story plot was a disaster, leaving these fine actors all over the place and ending with an overall mess of a movie. The STORY should always come first, even before production begins. You'd think Hollywood (or DC Films) would've figured that out by now.Nevertheless, despite my criticisms I'm rating this movie a six due to Margot Robbie's charismatic interpretation of Harley Quinn who is every bit the enjoyable psycho that she is in the comics. I actually prefer this crazier version of Harley in ""Suicide Squad"" than her somewhat more restrained portrayal in ""Birds of Prey."" Classic Harley is always a nutcase and is portrayed that way in comics and console games.Margot Robbie seems to know that that's what we love about her because - boy, did she ever hit the nail on the head with this interpretation, getting a comic book character as close to perfection as I've ever seen in a DC movie."
" Avoid it if you can. I couldn't, unfortunately...
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,2,"Truly hope that the executives who have approved this junk all have found new jobs by now.Just finished watching it on TV, together with friends who wanted to see it. And because they're friends, I sat it out. Hope that you, fellow movie fans, will be spared the agony."
" It's just a good movie.
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,6,It's a good movie. One time watch. Margot Robbie was great. Al thanks to her.
" Wow
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,3,"1 star for Will Smith, 1 for Margot Robbie and 1 for the soundtrack. The rest is pure garbage"
" Real meaning of Suicide Squad!
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,10,"I don't know why people criticised this film. It is a great movie having lots of jokes, action and fight. When it is Suicide Squad you expect them to destroy there target by uncertain means. This is not Avengers you Marvel fans. I have a lot of fun. Joker was awesome too, why they even compare with Dark Knight. Just laugh while watching movie, scream while watching movie that's it for you. Dude if you look it that way then you will understand that even credits are way awesome than everything. Clean your mind and have fun!"
" Tragedy or Travesty?
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,6,"Forcing an unlikely group of twisted, ragtag villains to work together and act against their own self-interest has all the hallmarks of a character-driven tragedy. The film sacrifices this unique identity in favour of imitating the competition over at Marvel. The upbeat soundtrack and colourful corniness can at first glance be entertaining, but I had hoped for something more poignant. Roman Vasyanov was at times able to capture intriguing imagery, although no shot lingers long enough to inhale due to the film's frenetic editing. I respect David Ayer for the creative liberties he took with these characters, more specifically his take on the fantabulous Harley Quinn who has gone on to exist without him thanks to Margot Robbie. The initial marketing boasted promise, I gave studio executives who were so clearly trying to rival another company's success the benefit of the doubt. Now I see that the joke was on me."
" It's not too bad but...
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,7,"I watched Suicide Squad extended version and I was starting to like the film until I started not understanding some things, maybe when I go to see it for the second time I will understand, but back to the film, I liked the performance of the characters although some could be better explored, I liked the action scenes, I liked the film's soundtrack and Ben Affleck's participation as a batman, now Joker's performance was not the best I've ever seen and they should have put him on the screen longer and of course the script was not very good.
Summing up and concluding it is a film that is not as bad as they say but it could have been much better."
" Perfectly bad ensemble movie
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,2,"It introduces a fairly large number of characters in a terribly poor way. There's no reason given to care about anybody in the movie. The reasoning given to assemble the squad isn't credible. Action sequences mostly take place in darkness punctuated by fire that, if it isn't digital, might as well have been given that it looks like it. The Suicide Squad fight a bunch of CGI. Jared Leto's Joker is incredibly annoying every time he opens his mouth; the Joker was taken in such a different direction they should've made it an entirely new character. Adam Beach is totally wasted. Skip it!"
" 6 stars... for Harley Quinn.
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,6,Margot Robbie was the only good thing about this Movie. Great portrayal of her character. Everything else was embarrassing and mediocre
" I am simply baffled
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,1,"Absolutely one of, if not, the worst movie i have ever seen. It's so bad it's hilarious. Me and my girlfriend still make fun of this ""movie"" till this very day, and it has been 4 years."
" The Very Definition of a Bad Movie
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,3,"Suicide Squad is a pretty terrible film. The premise is promising, and it's enjoyable in a so bad it's good way, but that's all the praise that I'm capable of giving this film. Every aspect of this film is an absolute failure.The movie features such a large cast that it's hard to develop any of the characters. Harley Quin and Deadshot (and maybe Diablo) are about the only ones that I could say have somewhat of a personality. The rest are merely side characters.Harley's character is that she's crazy and she cracks jokes. Deadshot's character is that he cares about his daughter and every decision he makes is because of her. Diablo is sad because his family died because of him and he refuses to use his powers now. I'd like to remind you that these are the best characters in the film, and yet they all feel one-dimensional and cliche.The plot is something that's been done a million times already. Bad guy escapes from confinement and then shoots a giant laser in the sky to blow up/Terra form the planet. Meanwhile a ragtag group of misfits work together to try and stop him/her with a low chance of them winning *Yawn*.The acting ranges from terrible to okay. Jared Leto stands out as the worst actor in the film, with a performance so bad it seemed like a parody of the Joker. Will Smith is trying to save the film, but his line delivery is off. Margot Robbie is okay. However, the main problem arises in the terrible dialogue, which feels like something that Micheal Bay wrote.The comedy feels forced and cringe worthy. I heard that they were re-shoots with the film to add more jokes and make the tone feel more lighthearted. Clearly DC were trying to copy Marvel movies and make them similar to them in tone. This also explains the futile attempt at having catchy songs shoved in to make it more like Guardians of the Galaxy. Unfortunately, this film lacks any heart that GOTG had.The premise itself is quite idiotic. Why do you need a bunch of villains to save the world when you have much stronger heroes who could do the job better? Most of the members of Suicide Squad barely have any powers that an ordinary military soldier won't have. The only exception is Diablo. Other than him, none of the characters should be the choice to fight a super powered villain.The plot is riddled with contrivances and pointless action. The color palate is dark, vomit like green. The CGI is (as usual with all DC movies) quite garbage looking. Watch this movie if you hate yourself."
" Easy and quite entertaining
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,5,"The film is a quite entertaining as superhero movie, but the character of the Joker is a disappointment. In general, Jaret Leto is a good actor, but in this film it just not believable."
" The clown girl feel handsome
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,8,"""You are afraid of my heart, but not afraid of bullets."" I like the clown and the clown girl! The scene of kissing and kissing in the chemical pool is super beautiful. Since then, it has become the weakness of each other. I am crazy about making fun of you and doing evil with you, I have already ignored the other plots and I want to see their scenes."
" $175 Million Dollar Fireworks Display
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,2,"Even though this film has been out for a few years, I just recently took the time to watch it all the way through. It was a slog but I'm glad I did as I believe there is a lot to be learned from this movie.Suicide Squad stops at nothing to razzle-dazzle the audience with extended scenes of destruction, explosions, gunfire and over-the-top f/x. All this despite having very little heart or anything the audience should connect to or care about. There is no time to get to know a character before we're introduced to yet more supposedly badass characters (all with the hokiest setups) until we (or at least I) barely cared about any single one of them. This is a great example of a movie that overstretches itself with the number of characters but just doesn't deliver the emotional connection that better movies can achieve with just a handful of fleshed-out, well-written characters.The f/x were what you'd expect for a movie with this big of a budget. Some shots I'm sure took many thousands of hours of labor to put together, but at the end of the day they are weightless and forgettable because I was emotionally checked out. I don't mind movies with over the top spectacles of violence and mayhem but they have to serve the story and be meaningful within the context of that narrative. From watching this, it seems the production mindset was more 'just give the people explosions and broad character tropes, they won't taste the difference.'Overall, I did not enjoy this movie but still think it should be understood and learned from. Compare it to the boiled-down, gut-wrenching Joker and wonder how both these movies could be produced by the same company."
" Terrible...!!!
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,2,"I am a DC fan... So watching this movie was heartbreaking.
The characters' intro were so cool..at first glance it seemed this would be good movie, but it was awful. The movie cast included prominent names... but what a waste... the marketing made it seem like something to look for... the score music was awesome ; maybe that was the only thing good about... oh sorry it won oscar for makeup.... but everything else lacked substance.... it almost felt like a panic project, like it had to catch upto Marvel.... But we fans didnot deserve this movie i guess. They are even planning on a second one... oh lord...
DON'T waste your time watching this movie......"
" Joker is the best
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,9,"Joker is the best character in this movie.
Joker in this movie is also the best character out of all the joker movies to date.
Harley Quinn is the second best character in this movie."

P.s Yes,I know that 4 years passed."
" An Average Superhero Movie
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,5,"I really liked the characterizations in this movie. The actors did a great job capturing their characters. The problem with this movie is the lack of a story.First, most of the movie is backstory. It takes forever for the actual story to start. I don't think this introductory material is essential to the story about the formation of the team. This material is just character backstory and it gets old.Second, the crisis is entirely the consequence of creating the Suicide Squad itself. The plot is entirely circular. As a result, it trivializes the story.Third, the villains are terrible. I love watching the Enchantress, but she and her brother are easily defeated. They don't make much of a problem for the Suicide Squad. If a real superhero had engaged them, this movie would have been over in one minute."
" Love this movie!
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,8,"So, I like superhero movies, but I'm not a true fan of them. I like more super villain movies than super hero movies, such as Joker. This movie was one of them and it was better than expected. Why did this movie get such bad reviews?
A bad thing about this, and the only bad thing for me is that some parts get a bit boring because they removed some good scenes. Other than that, I liked how the story was, and that not all of them had powers. Can't wait for a second one."

" David Ayer does not find a tone for his film and is content with the more bureaucratic solutions of the genre
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,6,"After Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy and new versions of the Dark Knight and Superman himself in Zack Snyder's films, it's time to be introduced to humanitys most feared villains, the worst of the worst, the 'Suicide Squad'. Being the third film in the Extended Universe DC, it is written and directed by David Ayer, responsible for directing the excellent Fury (2014) and Harsh Times (2005) and for scripting the also great Training Day (2001).
In this storyline, after Superman's death, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) brings together Task Force X, a team of dangerous criminals trapped in Belle Reve prison, consisting of the elite hired killer Pistoleiro (Will Smith), from the former Harlequin psychiatrist (Margot Robbie), former pyrokinetic gangster El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), opportunistic thief and alcoholic Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), genetically modified Crocodile (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and specialized killer Amarra (Adam Beach). They are placed under the command of Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) to be used in high-risk missions for the United States government. Each member has a bomb implanted in the neck, designed to detonate if any member rebels or tries to escape.
Ayer's script wastes no time and has been concerned from the beginning with presenting the criminal record of each of the criminals to the audience through Amanda Waller's explanation. We know that the Gunman is the most wanted hired killer in the world, but that he has his greatest vulnerability in his daughter. The Harley Quinn appears as the former psychiatrist of the Joker in jail, with whom she ended up falling in love and having an insane relationship. She was complicit in the murder of Robin by the Joker - suggested earlier in 'Batman vs Superman' - and being as beautiful as she is unpredictable. Captain Boomerang is presented as one of the greatest thieves in the world and does not know how to work as a team. El Diablo thought he was the king of the world, no one said no to him, until a family tragedy caused him to be consumed in guilt and decided to surrender to the police. Crocodile, a genetically modified being, is an experienced cannibal and fighter. And then there is The Magic (Cara Delevingne), the archaeologist June Moone, who fell into a cave by accident and found something she shouldn't have, giving rise to the most powerful meta-human known. In addition to being able to do almost anything through her magic, she is able to teleport, self-regenerate and fly. Her list of powers is almost endless.
The first quarter of the film is interesting because it shows a little of the squad's criminals at work in the past, showing their supernatural abilities or not, and it also shows some of the affective bonds of some of them. It is also revealed that the Gunman, the Crocodile and the Harlequin are captured by Batman (Ben Affleck, in a cameo), and that Captain Boomerang was arrested by the Flash (Ezra Miller). These small participations, together with those already shown in 'Batman vs Superman', serve to glimpse the future Justice League film, which will include the participation of the entire superhero team.
From the presentation of each one and showing the ties that they have with the heroes of the Justice League, the script starts to focus exclusively on the development of these characters and this is where the greatest deficiencies of history are clear. Since we are talking about villains / criminals, it was necessary for the public to create a certain empathy for these characters so that they would have a certain audience audience. With such serious flaws in the development of the story, it turns out that the audience does not empathize with virtually any character. There is no evidence on the scene that these guys are as bad as what is written in the comics.The one that wins the most dramatic arc is the Gunman of Will Smith, evident consequence of the actor's contract, who always asks for a certain time on screen, in addition to the position of protagonist, who, yes, ends up assuming within the feature with a background story involving his daughter who loves him even though he knows he does bad things. Your character was very well built and works as the link between all the elements of the Squad. Another highlight is Viola Davis, who creates an unscrupulous Amanda Waller, who does justice to the strength that the character has in the comics. Another one that is one of the great successes of the film is the Harlequin of Margot Robbie, which has an intrinsic sensuality (in fact, several scenes are keen to highlight the body of the actress), and which has some good jokes in her psychotic personality, end up yielding some of the best moments of the feature, except when she participates in embarrassing romantic moments with Jared Leto's Joker.
In fact, the Joker is a case in point, with possibly a meager fifteen minutes of scene in the entire film, the character is more irritated than it proves to be threatening. If Heath Ledger composed a cold killer, full of believable and terrifying tics, Jared Leto is nothing more than a decoy with his green dyed hair and his fake laugh. The device villain's make-up on his teeth and barely explored teeth, with his more underground 'gansta' style and crime lord on Gotham's streets disappoint. It is known that several scenes with the Joker were cut from the final edition of the film, which could improve the general perception about the character. However, in 'Suicide Squad', the Joker does not play opposite another great figure besides the Harlequin. In his quick appearances, he is neither a member of the squad nor an opponent of the team. It serves as the Harlequin's romantic (and unjustified) interest. And like the other characters in the film, it's not clear whether Ayer's idea was to sew Harley Quinn's motivations or exploit his sick dependence on the crime clown. In both cases, it fails miserably. If we removed all the scenes from the Joker from the film, the plot would have no narrative damage.
Most frustrating of all is the feeling of an opportunity that has been misused. The idea of the characters being connected and creating greater bonds as the missions were executed, is well-intentioned, but the missions (in fact a mission) do not prove to be the most threatening and cause an inevitable anticlimax. The plot only gains a little more rhythm in the final half hour, in which the group has to face the sorceress Magic, who, like her brother, are defeated with extreme ease and without the group actually acting together. Generic action scenes without twists and an unmotivated threat take all the little dramatic burden built up to that point. Quick editing does not let any character development happen. A scene was soon cut without ceremony.
It is important to highlight that the soundtrack is one of the great points. The composer Steven Price does his best to bring urgency to the film combined with music tracks ranging from Panic! at the Disco, Kehlani, Leslie Gore, Rick James, even Kevin Gates, Twenty One Pilots among others. Although not as efficient as the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' soundtrack, it is an eclectic soundtrack and well used for every situation shown on the screen.
Trying to incorporate some factors of the success of 'Deadpool', released shortly before in theaters, the studio requested that reshoots happen, trying to make the final result less serious, but badly written and loose jokes are always lost within a plot that it tries to bring a considerable level of seriousness. We have a mix of tone and rhythm caused also due to these reshoots and later insertions, which greatly prejudices the final result. The feeling is that once again DC Comics misses the opportunity to build an eloquent script that highlights the dark universe of its characters. In contrast to Marvel's colorful portfolio, DC has in its hands an entire pool of tormented heroes and villains who have been exploited much more efficiently in the past. David Ayer had the potential to oxygenate superhero films, with handpicked characters from Batman's excellent villain gallery, but David Ayer does not find a tone for his film and is content with the more bureaucratic solutions of the genre."
" Its a good film but....
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,7,"This could of been a really excellent film but they cast Jared Leto into the film and that ruined it.
If you fast forward the bits with Jared in it, its then a good film."
" Man....
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,3,"What was this? That was just awful.It started off good introducing all of these great and promising anti-hero characters that DC really nails in the book (Literally in the comics and The Dark Knight. FAR more preferable to start with if you want to invest in the DC universe), and then it goes downhill. There was no meaning in this movie at all. We get all of these cool moments, but where is the story? It became nothing in the end.I gotta say, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, and Will Smith all carried this movie on their backs. I say that in the best way possible. But dear lord. As much as I like the guy, NEVER put Jared Leto's Joker back in the DC universe. EVER! This movie, in a way, shafted his career into a low. And for an Oscar winner, he was just really disappointing in this film. Easily the worst Joker I've seen.I guess the score and costumes were fine. But jeez, Pass. Pass. PASS!!!!!You want a good DC movie, I'll happily direct you to The Dark Knight and Joker (2019)."
" Watch the Extended Cut!
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,6,"Most of the reviews are spot on. Not enough character development, the antagonists are a mess and the plot is unclear and all over the place.
With that said, don't waste your time watching the theatrical version. If your going to watch this movie for the first time, or even if you've seen it many times before, the extended cut is MUCH BETTER.
I don't understand why all the Joker scenes were cut. His character is slightly more developed in the extended cut. Also, it explains a little bit more about the relationship between Harley & Joker.
Pieces I thought were pretty important, I found were all left out in the theatrical version.
I thought this movie had a lot of potential that it didn't quite reach. The acting wasn't the problem in my opinion. It started out great, but lost its way pretty quickly after the character introductions.
And I absolutely had a hard time with the CGI army of alien bad guys.
I hope they attempt another Suicide Squad with a MUCH BETTER script and consideration for all the mis-steps that most fan reviews have pointed out."
" The ingredients are good but the soup isn't
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,6,"Suicide Squad
I feel SS is a missed opportunity. The ingredients are there but somehow fail to make a good soup. At the heart of the problem is the ludicrous nature of the whole idea of SS. I a movie that establishes the existence of the Flash and Batman they answer the question ""what of the next Superman is evil"" by arming a 100 pound mental patient with a baseball bat. The whole movie is further stopped in its tracks by Flag and Waller, 2 of the worst characters I have ever seen. Roid raging, meth addicted, over the top aggressive against people who can kill them in a nanosecond. They don't get the good kind of hatred one can get from a bad guy, but the 'Turn the TV off' hatred that no character should invoke as it defeats the purpose of the movie. There's totally wasted characters like Katana, introduced with one line of forced exposition and who spends most of her time menacingly unsheathing her weapon before inexplicably joining the SS based on nothing.
Halfway through the movie I cannot even begin to describe the anger I felt when I realized that half the movie is a rescue mission to save Waller (you know, the supposedly though woman whose complete inaptitude causes more problems than the main baddie of the movie). The main baddie, speaking of which, is played by a model who can't act, has a brother that is pointless, and uses fisticuffs instead of her wizard power to fight the SS, all set to an obnoxious soundtrack whilst the utterly unnecessary Joker is whining in the background of the ""plot"". To add insult to injury, when the SS somehow emerges victoriously Waller immediately gets in their faces trying to act tough, even though, I'll say it again, the whole Earth was risked on her utter uselessness in her job. Why does everyone bend over backwards to accommodate her? Just have Croc bite her head off and it would be a happy ending.
There are some good elements, like Margot Robbie and the use of colour, but you have Will Smith who plays Will Smith, a guy with a boomerang, and a crocodile man who is a racial stereotype. I had high hopes for this movie but you might as well watch the trailers and you'll get all the good stuff without suffering through this cinematic torture."
" What a miss, what a miss..
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,3,"Sigh... where to begin with this film...So, the characters.. DC was trying to jump the Avengers bandwagon and failed. Whereas Marvel made multiple films building character and progression, DC threw a bunch of new antiheroes together and called it the Suicide Squad. The only character I liked was Margot Robbie playing Harley Quinn, the rest was really bland/boring and had little to no value. I also really dislike Jared Leto's Joker, it was a disaster to say the least... And even Will Smith had such a bad role, which I don't blame him for but I blame the terrible writing of this. Because oh man, the plot was... non-existent. What plot even? Some random antiheroes fighting some shady looking monsters, freeing a woman from a so-called ""powerful"" monster and then they live happily ever after... not. They just go straight back to where they came from; their cells. Oh and don't even get me started about the very random songs they threw in for no reason. It made me even more disconnected with the film. I don't even want to know how much they've paid for these missmatches of songs throughout the film.This film literally was useless. No character development, no real story, random music, and really boring and difficult to sit through in general. Avoid this film at all costs."
" A good screenwriter is very important

But it's a pity that the movie was discouraged at the most critical time, which led to the incoherence and confusion in the end. I have to say that the team's Cass are the most capable / competent group in all kinds of change series, so I expect them to be better and better writers in the future."

" Upon Rewatching it years down the line, It's One of DC'S Greatest ever made 💙💚💓💛💜
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,10,"The Pre Release Hype hurt this Movie when it was first Released. But i have got to Say, upon rewatching it years down the line, it's So Unique. The Introduction to the Characters, the story, the containment in the City and that epic Ending with the Music and Deadshot, it was an Amazing watch.Things I liked About this Movie:° The Cool Artistic Introductions to Each of The Characters.° Will Smith, Margo Robbie, Viola Davis, Joel Kinnaman, Cara Delavigne (As Echantress) and Jared Leto were the 6 Characters in this film that I thought did a Good Job.° Deadshots' Gunplay scene was So Cool and the 'Terrorist' scene was very very good.° This Take on The Joker was SO Interesting, he was Like a Crime Boss version of The Joker, His Costumes, His Jewellery, His Mannerisms and His Overall design was So Good.° Incubus Looked Terrifying.° The Final Shot from Deadshot Was Great and Had suspense and Epic Music. 🎶° The Setting in Midway City felt Exciting.The Bad Stuff:° There was a certain Scene where you think, if he knew that was going to happen to him why the hell would be go down there and do that?° Some of the Other Characters were Forgettable but maybe that is what they intended.° Some Bad Dialogue at times.° I wanted to see more of The Joker.It's not a Perfect Movie but it has a totally Unique feel to it. It's another Production that is of its own kind.Overall, For Me, The 3 Greatest DC Movies are Aquaman, Birds of Prey and Suicide Squad. This is Definitely one of DC'S Greatest they have ever made in my eyes. A Unique Production."
" Strong cast, poor in every other aspect

I just can't believe this childish script did better in box office than a fabulous movie such as alita; battle angel 2019. It makes me sad, people just want to watch action and sci-fic movies to see some violence, not seeking any meaning in it"

" Watched director's cut and was amazed!
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,8,"OK, hear me out. I love both MARVEL and DC., but MARVEL has cooler and more creative super heroes while DC doesn't. But MARVEL has boring and unimaginative bad guys and DC has better ones. In that spirit, I enjoyed almost every second of this movie. Performances were amazing and I am very thankful to Margot Robbie for making Harley Quinn popular. I am not, however, thankful to Jared Leto who made Joker a gangster who was kicked in the head during childhood. Despite that, movie is filled with good atmosphere and music which fits with the scenes very well, making it an enjoyable ride. One thing that people also don't seem to understand. This is not an action movie. This is movie about bad guys. Their point of view. And I am thankful that they still show to us they are bad, even if we are somehow rooting for them to win. Will Smith is great in his roles, and so is everyone else in fact. Even Leto has charming moments when he is on scene with Harley, even though their portrayal isn't really based on comics and point of Joker and Harley was never love. All in all, I could rant about this movie for hours, but, what's the point? If you like DC and want a movie about their bad guys, you will enjoy. If you are looking for a casual fun ride, you maybe won't really be satisfied completely with it. 8.5/10! It could have been better, but in my eyes, it has a unique atmosphere, great cast and it was first who did what it did, so it will always be the best for me! :D"
" AN AWFUL MESS
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,1,"My, what was that? I heard so many opinions and yes, they varied but I never thought my disappointment would be so big.
1. Actors.
No, even Margot Robbie did not impress me, at all. She overdoes, overplays, over-everything every singly frame and shot. In fact, her vapid delivery leaves an empty bewildered stare - why. Will Smith? Nay, too formulaic and very badly predictable. Jai Courtney? Nay, too bland and very heavily on the surface. The rest is intermittently forgettable.Ah, yes, there was Cara DeLevigne, probably, the weakest and the worst choice here, as her delivery is painfully bland and pointless.
2. The Plot.
Nothing new. You do this, if you don't - you Then we see lots of shootings, deaths and wild fights. Did we see it before> Yeah, lotsa times.
3. Video Effects.
Not bad, Again, nothing new.
4. The Joker.
That was the worst of the worst of the worst offenders of a hero of a choice of an actor. Shame, Shame,Conclusion - awful mess, rat salad, barbaric stew,"
" Wtf
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,2,"What the f did I just watch? Poor plot, cheesy dialog, absolutely no character personality, just a hot mess.

" Predictable...
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,5,"Predictable as hell from minute 2 of the movie and due to the whole storyline. Don't even mention the plot...
Although i liked most of the cast.. Will Smith should be banned from comic movie's at all.DC should GIVE the rights back to Marvel!"
" Lame
",2020-03-13 00:00:00,2,"Now the TV -s started to show it, and I was able to watch it many times.Very boring film, with boring jokes and sexualizing Margot. I would just mentioned the biggest conradict: In the end, the squad successfully destroys the enemy, whom no army could stop, thats why they hired. And in the end the squad jokingly accepts to go back to jail and get some awards like TV. Like who could stop them?
Totally bsh_t like this the whole film is."

" My issue
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,10,My issue is I don't like the Joker as a gangster. Margot Robbie steals the show as Harley Quinn. Deadly but stunning. Is there any man or woman who wouldn't enter her cage to play?

" GOD-TEAR MOVIE
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,10,"I feel like this movie was hated too much. It got mainly 1-4 stars when people reviewed it and I feel that was a little harsh. The cast was mostly great, i would say the stand outs were Jared Leto and Margo Robbie but everyone else was good too. the cameos were almost something ripped out of a comic book. I feel people are hypocrites for hating how the flash cameo-ed when things like that happen ALL THE TIME in the comics. Jared Leto was underused. In conclusion this movie is great and you guys are mean."
" I wish I could say otherwise but I can't lie like that.
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,6,A film that utterly lacked any substance. There was promise at the beginning with a great opening introducing us to the anti-heroes which was awesome. And then.... Nothing? Stranded such a talented cast fighting comical looking goons and an anti-climax of a villian. The two stars are for Viola Davis and Margot Robbie who give their roles everything. Every other character is disposable and forgettable. And Jared Leto as the Joker? Lets say no more.
" I HAD great expectations

These bad reviews are just dedicated comic book fanboys, seriously thats it.
This movie is a lot of fun if you just sit back and enjoy the ride.
Margot Robbie is amazing as harley Quinn and deserves an oscar for it, simply a brilliant performance.
Jared Leto as the Joker.... I do understand, why people compare it to the flawless Heath Ledger performance as the Joker but in this, movie Jared Leto's Joker works really well
Really you can't compare it because in this movie heath ledgers joker wouldn't have worked.
But nonetheless this is a really fun and entertaining movie!!
Go watch it, keeping an open mind and just enjoy the movie."
" Such a good film
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,9,"Now I don't know a lot about the DC universe or the comics, but from what I watched this movie was dope.A group of villains are banded together to help take down an evil force taking over the city. That's basically it..I thought this was so cool, and enjoyed it a lot. There was rarely any slow parts and it was full of action and exciting scenes. Margot Robbie was so incredible and fun to watch. Proud to see an Aussie go far."
" Aggressively bad and painfully stupid
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,3,Suicide Squad is a wasted opportunity. The premise of villains being pressed into service to do the dirty work heroes can't or won't perform is interesting and worth exploring unfortunately this film rejects that and just makes an incoherent mess.The threat in the film is not morally dubious and superheroes would be fully within their jurisdiction to address it. Just a miserable film and a swing and a miss.
" back after birds of prey
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,6,"Honestly just came back here to say that I stand by my 6/10 rating. But I wanted to add that I think it's still better than Birds of Prey. I don't understand people saying that regardless of what they think of BoP, ""at least it's better than Suicide Squad"". I rewatched SS today just to figure out how I felt and I can genuinely say this was the better film. Not that that's a very high bar though..This movie is really below average at best. The plot doesn't have a good enough structure or a solid foundation but it's a fun enough film to watch if you are bored and wanna kill time. Its watchable, basically.Margot as Harley was probably the main highlight. The formation of the team itself was believable enough but they could use some more development on screen before I accept them as a properly established squad. The cast did a good job overall and I liked pretty much all the characters, even though some of them weren't highlighted too much. Like they're the kind of characters you'd wanna root for.El Diablo's death was sad and a typical cheesy sacrifice type moment. However, while I DO feel for the character, his death wasn't particularly moving? I feel like we didn't get to know the character enough to really mourn his loss. We knew his tragic backstory but outside of that we didn't connect much with the character itself so I got over his death by the following scene honestly. But I did feel that the characters themselves felt a true loss in his death which adds to the fact that this plot, although sloppy, does lead you to believe that the team has been formed well enough, it wasn't forced.The soundtrack was cool but some of the music ques were so randomly placed and that could have been done in a better way.I also personally believe Jared's Joker received too much flack for this. I liked his performance and think he did a good job. He's no Ledger or Phoenix but his portrayal doesn't deserve the poor treatment its given. Not too mention this is barely enough footage of him to go on to blatantly hate on the portrayal. People should have given it more of a chance in my opinion."
" Worse than Batman v Superman
",2020-02-10 00:00:00,3,"Suicide Squad is with out a doubt the worst DCEU movie I've ever seen. The film is ugly and lifeless. The only redeeming thing about this movie is Harley Quinn, Deadshot, and Amanda Waller. The Enchantress looked cool in the beginning of the movie, but her design got a downgrade half way through the movie. The action is bland and unmemorable. The movie has a lot of characters in it, but I felt like they didn't know what to do with most of them. The Joker in this movie is by far the worst interpretation of the Joker in any media I have ever seen. I don't recommend watching this movie, especially since if you skip this one, you'll literally miss nothing."
" Had so much potential
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,5,"This movie had alot going for it, new and bold characters, a refreshingly different take on the usual superhero movies, and a phenomenal soundtrack. But the rest was sloppy and disappointing. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching it, even went to see it a second time in theaters, but this didn't overshadow the poor forethought of how they presented the movie.First of all, this was a Will Smith movie. Plain and simple. He was the biggest name in the cast and got an incredible amount of screentime which could have been better spent evening out the other characters.Secondly, the characters were extremely unevenly distributed. They spent significant amounts of time discussing the backstories for Will Smith and Margot Robbie's characters but only a few minutes on the other characters who should have been equally important. Then a few other characters only got literal seconds worth of an intro, even though a couple of these characters were present throughout the rest of the film. This made them feel awkwardly placed compared to others who had been very thoroughly introduced.And finally, the people in charge of this film couldn't seem to decide if they were making a backstory movie for Harley Quinn and the Joker or if they were making a Suicide Squad film. Even though they ended up cutting the majority of Joker's scenes, the film had enough background there to beg the questions- why didn't they do a full film on these two, and if the hidden focus of this film was supposed to be the relationship between the Joker and Harley Quinn, then why was Deadshot given so much attention on his own too?Overall, the sloppy distribution of time spent on the different characters didn't seem to have been given much thought and resulted in a film that was enjoyable to watch but didn't hold up to what it could have been."
" Not good
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,1,This movie was made for the money. It's really bad
" flat
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,3,"Fell wayyy too flat, characters remained undeveloped, including the antagonists; dialogue was mediocre and at times insufferable; plot lacks originality and depth. Not a good Friday night watch."
" Dc is definitely lost
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,2,"This is one of the worst comic book based movies I've ever seen... the worst being ""Batman and robin"" ... and competing side by side with Batman vs Superman, aquaman, the fantastic four (all of them) and justice league... all From DC"
" Unhappily
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,5,Villians vs. Villians you did not use it when you have a beautiful subject and should appeal to adults..
" A mix of good and bad choices
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,6,"While this gave us a great Harley Quinn, a good Deadshot and a wonderful Amana Waller, it also gave us a crappy villain (in acting and in story), and a terrible choice of gansta-Joker. The joker in this movie was a joke. Not Jared Leto's fault, he is a great actor and singer. The choices of costume and script ruined the Joker."
" Yes The Joker was awful but...
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,1,Harley Quinn was as annoying as any character I have ever seen. Having no background on the Suicide Squad it seems she nailed the role according to several reviews but I cringed every time I had to hear her voice or even look at her. Between this and her non role in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood I cannot stand to see anything she is in.
" It has 2 huge problems
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,5,"This movie was ""nice"" at best, it had 2 main problems; first of all it was written very badly 😕the actual plot was sh**, there was no meaningful conversations between any of the characters and there was just too much going on at the same time, second of all; Jared Leto should have been fired.. he was real bad! I could not stand to hear him talk at all! I had to just ignore his presence all together to be able to watch the movie till the end , tbh I'm only watching this right now bcz I want to watch the new Birds of prey and after watching this I'm not that optimistic about it"
" Nothing unique or all that impressive.
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,6,"My favourite scene in this movie would be when The Joker pushes his girlfriend into a vat of ... melting crayon wax? Then feels remorse, precedes to save her and then laughs and laughs as their clothes melt? Swirling colours float around them, just beautiful.Anyways as a whole this movie this was just okay, nothing unique or all that impressive. The beginning was interesting enough as the squad is introduced by a government agency recruiting some of the most dangerous incarcerated super-villains to form a defensive task force. We get some back stories, Batman, the Flash?! whatever, then it gets boring and disjointed with dark CGI action scenes as they try to save the world from the apocalypse.A big cast; I enjoyed the leader army dude 'Flack', Viola Davis is ok, nothing special for her, Will Smith just plays himself, Margot Robbie is good; fun, interesting, sexy. I saw Adam Beach for about a second and Scott Eastwood, a bunch of other familiar actors. Jared Leto is not used enough, is barely in this why? What a waste."
" Colorful empty
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,6,"The movie starts so interesting and colorful. Full of passion to become an amazing blockbuster. But its empty.Take tons of ideas, tons of different songs and put them together. It seems to see like a directors Childs dream came true, with unfinished endings. I miss the the intensity of Watchmen or Dark Knight. We jump from one story to another and mis the red line in too much information and less focus.About the rest: The cast is amazing, but the story doesnt take them."
" Suicide Squad (2016)
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,2,"Directed by David Ayer. Starring Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, Viola Davis, Jay Hernandez, Jared Leto, Cara Delevingne, Jai Courtney, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Ike Barinholtz, Scott Eastwood, Karen Fukuhara, Adam Beach. (PG-13)Deadshot (Smith), Harley Quinn (Robbie), and a bunch of other nasties with no more than one or two provided character traits are assembled to take down an even nastier entity, an archaeologist (Delevingne) possessed by an evil sorceress; no bets will be taken over whether or not there's a sky-beam during the climax. Ignoring the illogical premise of a team of supervillains being used for dangerous black ops missions, this overstuffed movie can't decide on just about anything: its tone, its visual style, its narrative direction, its very reason for existing. A soundtrack full of pop songs, a series of incoherent fights, and the occasional ""cool guy pose"" and wisecrack does not a good film make. Limp storytelling and erratic action filmmaking is (sadly) almost expected for an enterprise like this, but it's also atrociously conceived and constructed, a blare of chaotic sound mixing and spastic scene transitions that confuses frothing freneticism with heart-pounding excitement. Aside from Robbie, who is just unpredictably zany enough to really wish she and her character were transplanted to a different project, the cast is either completely wasted (Smith, Davis, etc.) or completely misconceived (Leto, Delevingne, etc.). Won an Academy Award for its makeup, which means it has one more Oscar than ""12 Angry Men"" does. Includes a few cameos from actors in their ""Justice League"" roles.23/100"
" Just Bad.
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,3,"This movie just sucks! No proper Plot. BS scenes, complete butchery of the Joker Role by that actor. And much more."
" Leto
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,1,There was/is no one who could play the joker better than Heath Ledger and no one who can/could play the joker worse than Leto.We went from perfect with Heath to beyond bad with Leto to pretty damn good with Joaquin.To everyone who wants to win an oscar: this movie won one. So never give up because the worst crap can still get one. As proven by this movie.
" Another crappy movie
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,1,"Didnt pay to watch the movie (I watched it on tv) but I still want a refund.Score I actually want to give on 100:
Margot Robbie +20
Other actors / acting -15
Story -15
Graphics +10That leaves us with a surprising but well deserved end score of 0/100. Congrats. I beg you, never make a movie again."
" It wasnt errible but definitely expected more.
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,6,With all the hype and everything it was definitely not what i expected and the ending was a huge let down.
" Action after action
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,2,Action after action but nothing new here. I can see why people love this and hate it. I am on the hate side.
" I like it

" Bad
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,1,Just bad and dumb story is incomplete and stupid the characters are terrible poorly written and boring
" Only watch for Harley Quinn
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,4,"Seriously, thats it. Jared Leto's Joker is the absolute worst by the way."
" Ok
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,7,Not great but not this bad as this rating Margot Robbie is good and the story is just rushed and silly
" Overall enjoyed
",2020-01-16 00:00:00,7,"So the villian they were up against was meh, but honestly, what kind of villian can you put up against a team of villians really? But the Squad itself was fun. Though I think they wasted Diablo as a character."
" Margot Robbie, perfect; not so much Leto.
",2020-01-10 00:00:00,4,"I liked it. It wasn't too bad but I didn't like Jared Leto's Joker being a pimp especially with performances like Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger (May he R.I.P) and Joaquin Phoenix. Margot Robbie however perfected her role and when she can be her best, she will.However, more on the note of this style. I like the neon style but there are some parts that closely resemble what a Marvel movie is like when DC can be masterpieces without being similar to another company (The Dark Knight, Joker, etc.).Overall, 5.5 out of 10."
" Just another one superhero movie
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed the movie overall even though it has a trivial and completely worthless plot, exactly as films of this genre usually have. Nevertheless the Suicide Squade has an advantage - movie doesn't want you to take all what happens for real. Characters rather just fooling around than trying to save universe like most of superheros."
" I shouted, ""This is lame"" at the theaters during the movie
",2020-01-07 00:00:00,2,"To think that a movie as bad as Con Air can do a series of character introductions better than Suicide Squad is saying something. Just read the other comments, they are describing the movie better than I will."
" Wacky but a little bit tame
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,4,"The idea is great; make an insane team ouf of baddest bad guys and put them against a greater evil. But for some reason it doesn't work very well. It's hard to pinpoint what's the problem. There's just nothing excellent anywhere.The actors are the best part, at least some of them are quite good. Margot Robbie is the highlight as Harley Quinn. That's a character that could have turned out very annoying in the hands of a wrong actress but Robbie is great every time she's on the screen. Also Will Smith does a solid performance as Deadshot. But Jared Leto is the worst-looking Joker ever. Luckily he doesn't have much screentime.The fantasy element is a bit boring. The Enchantress is not familiar to me from any comics so I don't know how the film version compares to the comic character. But in any case my opinion is that with a more down to earth villain the movie would have been better. It goes a bit too much into a fantasy territory with some ancient god-like beings and an end battle reminiscent of the original Ghostbusters. Harley's wooden hammer would have been more useful if the enemy was something more physical. Also the cgi in the magic effects is too extensive and quite bad in my opinion.Overall, the movie is not the worst but it's too meriocre. Considering the amount of interesting characters involved I can't understand why it turned out so indifferent. Except some little moments the movie just doesn't make me feel much anything.Comic book fans will watch it anyway but even if they do that doesn't mean everybody should."
" Narrative mess
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,1,"If you thought Batman v Superman was a narrative mess, then you are not going to enjoy this!"
" great cast and surprisingly fun, but generic and formulaic at best... ruined by studio meddling
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,5,"Suicide Squad is a solid and enjoyable movie about superhero villains lead by a terrific cast, but whose overall story, incoherent theme, and mired production prevents it from becoming more than a typical summer blockbuster.The movie's main strength is derived from its great cast chemistry. Viola Davis, Margot Robbie, and Will Smith as Amanda Waller, Harley Quinn, and Deadshot, respectively, are terrific, playing off one another perfectly. The strong cast makes the movie enjoyable.In terms of writing, the movie shows the motivations of the characters to follow orders imposed by Amanda Waller, leader of the team. The audience is shown enough background and character origin to sympathize, but their motivations are not explored or challenged in a meaningful and resonant way. The story amounts to little because it lacks a coherent overarching theme that unites the characters. Harley Quinn has her romance subplot with joker, played by Jared Leto, where he rescues her from prison. Deadshot is a for-hire-assassin whose work conflicts with his daughter's relationship. Other supporting characters such as Colonel Rick Flag, Captain Boomerang, El Diablo, Killer Croc, Enchantress, and Katana are given proper motivations but they fall within the same assessment of failing to explore or challenge them. Colonel Rick Flag, in particular, has a good subplot that revolves around her lover Doctor June Moone who is simultaneously the villain of the film, Enchantress. Aside from having an incoherent theme, Enchantress is a weak villain, not physically, but motivationally and who is rather formulaic. The movie could have been stronger if Joker was the main villain. Joker is instead a bad parody with his awful tattoos, ""damaged"", punk, and gangster personality.David Ayer's direction continues the Snyder influence on the DCEU, mixed with comedy and elements of Marvel's Guardian of the Galaxy. The editing is alright when it switches from present to past through recollection of character origins. The soundtrack is quite trippy and is one of the better parts of the movie.Suicide squad had great potential which was squandered by studio interference. The sort-of sequel, to be directed by James Gunn, hopefully, is an improvement by giving the director more free-rein and creative leeway.5/10"
" Could have been better
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,6,"I think they could have portrayed the joker better, I realize he's supposed to be a bad guy but that portrayal is ridiculous"
" The Joker was awful.
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,6,"I enjoyed the film and the characters, but the Joker was embarrassing to watch. Not original. Simply a guy looking like he's a few degrees off center.
Wish Heath Ledger could have reprised his version for this movie."
" This film just felt like a chore to watch.
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,2,A star each for Margot Robbie and Will Smith's performance. Other than that there's not a lot to like about this film. It just drags along and I really could not wait for the credits to roll.
" Um so...
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,9,"I have no clue why everyone so worked up over this movie I loved it, kept me intrigued I feel like everyone was so caught up on what they hoped it would be now y'all are just bitter ... amazing cast great action movie"
" 3rd dumbest thing I've ever seen
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,3,"But you know what I did like? Jared Leto as the Joker! Everyone says he's the worst representation of the classic villain ever, and while I agree it's not accurate enough, I don't think he's bad. I mean hey, at least he made me laugh. Everyone else in this movie makes me wanna kill myself. Will Smith is a really good actor, but his talent is wasted here. Margot Robbie wasn't very good as Harley Quinn so still don't know what she's capable of. Then there's Captain Boomerang, whom is one of the lamest villains in history. He throws a boomerang of all things to steal money or something. Killer Croc looks like crap as well as the whole movie. It has a brown and yellow tinted to it and there's absolutely no interesting cinematography. Every shot feels boring. Amanda Waller is a freakin' idiot thinking using bad guys is a good idea. And she sees the best security to look after the Enchantress is one guy. And he's not even RoboCop anymore! And I thought Dawn of Justice was bad...3.9/10 (Bad)"
" Please no more Will Smith!
",2019-12-13 00:00:00,1,Smith as a bad ass? Never happening in this lifetime! Starts bad and only gets worse.
" Bad movie with a lot left to be desired
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,2,"All right, I forgot I haven't gave this movie a review. Here we go:Let's talk about what I hate first: I hate that they doesn't even remotely show the Joker-Harley Quinn relationship right. Now everyone thought that Joker is just this crazy romantic practical guy (saves his girlfriend in a SWAT suit that spells JOKER, mind you). Now every girl is posting a picture of Harley and Joker with the words ""relationship goals"". Yep, that's pretty annoying.Character adaptation: Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang and El Diablo are definitely my favorite. Margot Robbie is the cinematic definitive Harley Quinn now. Meanwhile, El Diablo is a very sympathetic character. Although, I would have loved to see more of Captain Boomerang in the Flash solo movie. Almost all the characters are portrayed well. Deadshot, Amanda Waller (except for Joker). I'm still reserving my judgment on Jared Leto's Joker. But from what this movie have shown, I'm not in the positive zone. He's too much of a mafia for my liking, what with the ring-kissing and all. Almost to the point that I hope Ben Affleck would never use Joker again in his Batman movies (although a Red Hood based movie might tip my preference).Story: I thought they missed a very HUGE opportunity to show the ""who are the real bad guys?"" kinda thing when they first encounter the Enchantress' slaves. They should have make the soldier throw a bomb when Killer Croc is still fighting and killed Killer Croc. Then Deadshot would confront the soldier who threw the bomb and he could say ""But you guys are expendables. We all are. I wouldn't hold a grudge if my teammates threw a bomb while I was fighting. It's what makes me a soldier, and you ONLY a mercenary who cares about money and his own life"". That would make a very interesting clash of ideas and perspectives. They only did that with Waller.Villain: Meh, is all I can say. Very Marvel-esque villain. All show and no substance. No good motivation on why she wanna create a ""machine god"". Very powerful (too poweful) but easily defeated. Imagine any other strong character defeated that way (Darkseid for instance) It should be a dramatic climax, like El Diablo sacrificing himslef to kill the Enchantress rather than her brother. Definitely reminds me of Starlord final dance-off with what-his-name. (Oh Ronan, I forgot)Other than that, they're okay. A very Marvel-esque movie, for a DC movie. A bit disappointed, especially after the heavy themes of BvS. Don't get me wrong. Not saying it needs to be dark or anything. Just thought that while the idea is good, the execution isn't. A bad movie. But very memorable. Just a bit much like a Marvel movie to my liking. And since I'm never a fan of Marvel movies formula, a film that failed to cross the finish line for me."
" Watch the extended cut
",2019-12-10 00:00:00,7,"I kinda sorta liked this movie, but I do prefer the Marvel universe better.
This is a bad movie you can't help but like from start to finish. Then, the extended cut was on and I decided, what the heck, and ordered it. Most, if not all that was put back in the extended cut, really helped with the over all storyline. It still didn't boost it to the Marvel universe level, but it did make for a better movie.
I'm not really reviewing the movie, but just putting out there to watch the extended cut and give the movie another shot. DC still has a long way to go in the comic book movie arena, and if they don't step up their movie performance, they just aren't going to do it."
" Fell Flat
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,5,"Huge disappointment.. Should have been for of a Joker Harley story Line. But since Will Smith is in it, I'm sure everyone wanted him to have spot light. Leto is the man and So is Smith, roll with that."
" Such a freaking pandering cringefest
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,1,"After watching the new Joker I'm on a roll going trough older movies and this was as bad a watch now as it was in 2016...There's so much Harley Quinn worshipping from the writers it's insane. We get it, she's ""hot"", stop making all the guys turn around and look at her ass in every scene after she says a cringy line and walks away, ass in camera.But the worst part is how she was explained to the audience as ""crazier, better, braver, *any compliments* than the freaking Joker"". Did you think female pandering to this degree will make this movie magically good? Cause it sucks.I don't know where to start with Jared's Joker, but I seriously believe he was just written so badly, and designed as such a laughable pimp that no actor could have made this into a good Joker.Just an overall trainwreck."
" 2016 was not the best year for DC in Theaters
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,7,"Everyone thought 2016 was going to be a good year for DC with two big-budget action films going into theaters that would include so many characters fans had been wanting to see either finally on the silver screen or in more better forms. Instead, both films were incredibly divisive and needed extended cuts to help make them a little better.Suicide Squad (2016) is set after Dawn of Justice, and it assumes you know what happened in that movie. If not, it reminds you with one of the opening sequences. Apparently, after what happened in Dawn of Justice, other superbeings have begun to appear...and quickly get arrested by Amanda Waller, who is intent on using them like slave soldiers for protecting America. But like all the best laid plans, Amanda Waller's attempt to control beings beyond her control backfires, and her team is forced to clean up her mess before the Apocalypse is started.Let's talk about the good stuff in this film.Acting first. Viola Davis embodies Waller quite well as a total sociopath. I haven't seen how her character is like in the Arrowverse yet, but I'm getting there, BTW. Margot Robbie is brilliant as Harley Quinn, while Jared Leto was a great casting choice as the Joker. Will Smith's performance evokes memories of his early action films, mainly Bad Boys and Independence Day. I also liked the actors who played Katana, Killer Croc, and Captain Boomerang.The soundtrack is great, too. I am totally clueless about Rap/Hip-Hop, but there's some a lot of good pieces used in the film. Plus, using Rick James' 'Super Freak' was a great choice for Harley Quinn's introduction song.The Action Scenes are great, as well. I think it's they were very fluid and were enjoyable, but not incredibly memorable. In comparison to the fight and action scenes of the Dark Knight trilogy, Watchmen, and the first two official DC Extended Universe films, there's nothing really impressive, especially in comparison to the final fight between Superman and Zod.Also, I liked how they brought some backstory and motivation to the main villain (Enchantress). Nothing fancy, but it felt like more than what Marvel would normally do for their villains in Phase One and Two of their cinematic universe.Visually, the looks of the characters is cool. It's more realistic than the designs of the previous DC heroes, and evokes images of the Dark Knight trilogy and the first two Arrow seasons. There's no supersuits and incredibly elaborate costumes, which is appropriate, since the characters are definitely not superheroes. The only design I didn't like was the look of Enchantress, which is supposed to be like a parallel to Galadriel's dark form from Peter Jackson's movies about Middle-Earth, as she looks very different in the comics I have read about her.Now what I didn't like about the film.I didn't like that, for most of the first two acts of the movie, the characters were so detestable. It definitely rubs in your face that the characters are bad guys and they have some pretty bad traits. Then, at the third act, they unite and fight the Enchantress and the Incubus. I'm all for suspending belief, but even I was having trouble with why these guys would want to save the world.Also, I would have loved a lot more of Jared Leto's footage as the Joker. He seems like he is the best choice for the role and he really enjoys playing him. I sincerely hope he makes a cameo or something even bigger in the upcoming Birds of Prey movie in 2020 as well as The Suicide Squad in 2021. I'd say he's better than Nicholson's Joker and way more enjoyable than Ledger's Joker (Haven't seen Joaquin Phoenix's film yet, but that's not even in the official cinematic universe, so not a lot of motivation there. Besides, reportedly he's not even the real Joker in that one, anyway, so why bother?).My final opinion is that this is an okay film. If you feel like watching it, go for the Extended Cut. It's not the best DC Film, but it's not the worst. Besides, DC made up for it with Wonder Woman in 2017 and Aquaman in 2018 (No, I haven't seen Shazam, yet, but I really want to). I think David Ayer was not the best choice for directing this film, but I think James Gunn's upcoming Suicide Squad film will be much better, even if it is supposed to be a reboot and a remake at the same time yet still move the story forward...whatever that means. Hey, it's better than the theatrical cut of Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, anyway."
" Screw Happy Feet, This is the true worst movie of all time
",2019-12-04 00:00:00,1,"Every character in this excuse for a film made me cringe. The fact that people actually like this film is beyond my knowledge, it's also one of the most boring pieces of cinema I've ever seen in my life (no exaggeration) If you wanna watch an actual good film go watch Either cool runnings or black panther"
" My expectations for this movie were very high
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,3,"This movie had the best set of actors you could possibly imagine but it was still very poorly produced.
Some acting was super cringeworthy.
The harley quinn acting was despicable and the joker's acting was equally awful.
Many parts of the movie didn't show the joker but maybe this could be due to the cringe acting.
Apart from that, Will Smith and others did a good job but it wasn't enough to save the movie from mediocrity."
" Is it Possible NOT to fall for Margot Robbie?
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,9,"I watched an animated version of this film, but still, kinda knowing what was going to happen, I still was completely taken in with the entire movie! I think Magrot Robbies' 'Harley Quinn' character absolutely makes this movie! In the midst of all these really tough bad guys & soldiers, here trots lovable, curvy, scantily-clad Harley Quinn snapping, quibbling and flirting about everything while still managing to be The Joker's girlfriend, definitely does her share of the fighting, NEVER losing her femininity, and cute as all get-out the entire time; while also managing to be the one who gets the ultimate villain in the end! Oh, did I mention, all while strutting around in a completely outlandishly skimpy costume, and bending over constantly? The ONLY compromise made for her was she carried a baseball bat in this movie instead of her typical large wooden hammer. I really had a crush her for the entire movie -- and I'm an older guy!!!"
" Highly amusing
",2019-11-29 00:00:00,8,It is really a well made all bad guys attitude movie. Everyone has a bad side of the story. The movie is very amusing with a great track list
" One good thing
",2019-11-27 00:00:00,3,"Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as Harley Quinn and she absolutely steals the show. That's the only thing this movie has going for it.It's an ugly, predictable mess with editing so bad you'll develop a headache while the crappy writing makes you cringe, and Leto's portrayal of the Joker makes you roll your eyes non-stop."
" No point
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,1,I can't even remember what it was they were suppose to be doing. So random. Characters out of nowhere. I wasn't into anything. Southern-Swedish boyish white guy verses badass Will Smith (who will always be boyish no matter how hot his pecks are) with Vietnam undertones in the chopper... really? Nope nope! Why is NETFLIX full of these pointless movies?
" at least i stayed with it and gave it a chance to entertain...
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,2,"I don't hate this movie as much as everyone else appears to, and thought Leto's Joker quite good, and Margot Robbie was a lot of fun; Will Smith is just Will Smith, and is basically the same in all of his films. What I didn't like was how Amanda Waller put them all back in jail at the end. It left a very bad taste in my mouth."
" The second best DC film this decade
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,8,"This film, while not as good as Wonder Woman, is still a very good effort by DC. I don't know why or how, but DC keeps missing the mark with their movies. Suicide Squad was a welcome anomaly.
This movie focuses on a group of DC villains that are recruited for what looks like a suicide mission, hence the title. The military has held a witch captive, but lose their control over her, and she means to lay waste to the world. It is up to this group of people, facing a lifetime in prison, to take her out before her plans come to fruition.
There are quite a few of the bad guys from the world of DC that are featured in this movie, and featured well. Margot Robbie and Will Smith embody their characters of Harley Quinn and Deadshot respectively. Jared Leto's turn as the Joker, while heavily teased in the trailers, amounted to very little screen time, and that was probably for the best as he did not do a very good job at it. The biggest detraction for this movie to me was Cara Delevingne as the enchantress. I do not feel that she is a very talented actress and perhaps another could have done a better job. Still, as far as movies based on DC comics go, this one was very good."
" Suicide Squad
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,5,"Suicide Squad is a pretty boring film in my opinion. Will Smith and Margret Robbie were really good and the two best characters. It didn't find it funny, the action was entertaining enough and the plot was a pretty good premise. The villain was vary bad. Most characters were forgettable and the Joker was very disappointing. In my opinion this is the worst DCEU film at the moment.4.6/10"
" Suicide Squad: you may like you may not.
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,7,"Suicide squad is the third film in the DCEU (Dc Comics Extended Universe) this film takes place after the Film Batman Vs Superman. The film was about a team of super villains comprised of Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Deadshot (Will Smith), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), and others. The movie was an interesting take on some of the characters, Will Smith did an amazing job as deadshot and fit his personality well, that goes for Margot Robbie, and Viola Davis. The movie does feel a bit weaker with the cgi then BVS (Batman vs Superman) and MOS (man of steel) and a huge controversy is the Joker in this film, which is seen mainly for Harley Quinn's back story. The actor playing the Joker is Jared Leto And a lot of people do not like his over the top performance. I loved this movie even with the flaws but that is my personal opinion, and everyone has different opinions."
" Embarrassingly bad!
",2019-11-05 00:00:00,1,"This movie did what very few others have. It legitimately angered me. I'm not one to give exaggerated scores, but when i give this a 1/10 i do it from the bottom of my heart! Is there a single department where this movie doesnt fail? Lets see...Directing and cinematography: boring and half of the time its too dark to see whats going on (but thankfully we got to see a sky beam for the 450th time) (than one scene with Enchantress was the only nice one in the movie)Acting: mediocre at best (noone stands out). But don't worry about it cause Leto sent rats to his co-starsCostume design: horrible. Especially Harley Quinn looks like a stripperCGI: hilariously bad (especially at the fight scene where El Diablo turns into a fire monster and in every scene where
Enchantresses brother is in, it's so bad it hurts)Plot: Horrible at best, extremely predictable
and makes zero sense. Honestly it doesn't make sense even for superheroe movie standards (heroes like Batman or Flash are absent in a world ending threat despite appearing in the movie, Waller thinks a girls with a bat, a guy with guns, a crocodile, a guy with a boomerang, a guy who shoots fire and a guy who can climb stuff can go toe to toe witha superman level threat, the mindless goons they fight can *take 2 headshots and keep fighting* but all die with one headshot, an archaeologist deliberately breaks an artifact thousand years old, batman ambushes deadshot while he's with his kid and on and on the list won't stop)Characters: not only are they horrible, i don't care about them at the slightest since the only thing i know about them is a minute long flashback of them. Slipknot is there for a combined 2 minutes before dying and Katana is thrown in without any explanation or even backstory for most of the movie (but we do know that her blade captures the souls of her victims). Harley Quinn is also annoying at best and Deadshot is just Will Smith. The Joker is horrible, acts as if he's disabled and is a cringy laughing stock who is one tattoo away from cosplaying Lil Peep. The rest aren't even worth mentioning . Also the villain is laughable since she straight up belly dances through the entire movie and her entire motivation is she's evil.Humour: non-existent. Harley Quinns attempts at it made me roll my eyes so far back i didn't even know it was possible.Action: laughable. Just laughable. Not a single decent action scene. (Half of them weren't even clearly visible)Score: one of the worst ones I've ever heard of. An incoherent mess that uses songs from a plethora of genres, that dont fit at all with the movie or with one another. End results is a horrible score that downgrades every single song used in it.But hey at least the trailer was sweet!"
" Suicide Dud?
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,5,"The screenplay and plot wasn't much to speak of. The 'action' in the second act felt very much like it was filmed on a studio street set at Universal Studios. Jared Leto's method acting style didn't pay off as his portrayal of the Joker. If it wasn't for the charismatic Will Smith and Margot Robbie, it would be a hard pass for me. It's probably the only redeemable things about this film. Can see why they green lit a Harley Quinn based film in Birds of Prey."
" Patriotic Crap
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,1,"Yet another brainless movie where America is going to save the world from destruction mixed with the usual separated couple script, sugar-coated with loads of CGI. Apart from having and extreme cliche script the narrative is very shallow.
This movie is nothing more that a special effects showcase that only enjoyable by the non-adult mind. When wheigted as and adolecent movie it remains crap, there's no storyline and it's full of violent patriotism, brainwashing the young so they learn to appreciate war as a good thing. Suicide Squad is a cinematic suicide, only appreciable for some, good for none."
" Y I did like Suicide Squad despite not being a masterpiece
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,8,"I liked Suicide Squad (only the extended cut) despite some issues here and there.I must say that I have never read a Suicide Squad comic book but I have seen almost every DC's TV show or movie ever made: the old Superman movies, the Batman animated series, Lois & Clark, The Dark Knight, etc, etc.
What I have also done is reading 'Suicide Squad: behind the scenes with the worst heroes ever'. This book helped me better understand David Ayer's motivation for his script and the characters. I think he has largely been misunderstood by hardcore fans who can't really relate to his version of the property. And I do understand why.This a modern take on most of the characters like Leto's Joker. As Ayer put it: ""he's a 21st century villain with an iPhone"". And as for the story it is pretty much as good/interesting or as bad/senseles as any other one from almost every DC or Marvel superhero flick made to this day. From the likes of the first Thor or The Incredible Hulk up to more recent outings like Age of Ultron or Shazam!.
Do you really think the motivations behind Enchantress' actions are poorer or thinner than those of Red Skull or Dr. Sivana for example. Really? Really???
This is comic book material and villains in comic books tend to have the weirdests and flimsiest of excuses for their actions to begin with.
I did notice the film was given a more colourful and blockbuster look by producers than that of Ayer's original idea. They wanted more fun added to the movie and the result suffers from this. I guess they achieved this through more one-liners, the neon colouring and the (otherwise great) pop music.
Nevertheless I also hoped for more character development but I understood that couldn't have been possible with so many characters in a feature clicking on the 2 hour run-time.
On the whole I wished they had more time to develop their motivations and the whole plot. I would have added another 20 min. to the extended version just to fill those gaps/holes. But the studio didn't want a theatrical 150 min-long film and the result.... is this.On the other hand, I can't understand some people comalqining of things they do not usually complain about with the likes of Marvel feature films. It is like they are pouring hate for the sake of throwing out hate. If you watch the movie carefully most complaints are found to be false or tainted. Just one example: June finds the statuette of Enchantress and people say it is quite unrealistic for a real scientist to have opened the urn/statuette in the first place. But if you've seen the movie you can clearly notice how June is sort of bewitched and gets entranced by the statuette and so she kind of feels and irresistible urge to open it.
The same goes for some many other things but... anyway. This is just my opinion."
" Wtf DC this is
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,1,The worst thing in this awful movie was the Leto as Joker what a poor performance.
" Amazing
",2019-10-29 00:00:00,10,This movie was incredibly outstanding. The cast was very well with their acting skills and my favorite character was Harley! I truly was amazed by the work put in and I can hardly wait for a part 2.
" Gave Up Half Way Through
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,2,"This was really a terrible movie, I got to the last 65 minutes hoping it would get better but I just could not bring myself to finish this load of crap.
Didn't really understand the whole story-line, Jared Leto's Joker was the worst I have ever seen, admittingly, after Heath Ledger, it would be extremely difficult to portray the Joker (I haven't yet seen The Joker) so this opion may change after next week.
Margo Robbie as Harley Quinn was passable, but she didn't have the voice I expected from Harley, that high pitched ""Mr J"" that Arleen Sorkin did so well in The Animated Series.
The other support characters are pretty ordinary.
Not a great movie, give this one a mess."
" Just Too Much
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,2,"I remember as a child when Universal decided to take all the monsters (Frankenstein's monster, the Wolf Man, the hunchback, Dracula, etc.) and have them all in the same movie. These were the worst of the series.. This is another case of too many characters, no plot, no substance. I guess it won an award for costuming but the characters demand that they be costumed to be the characters. Don't bother."
" Why so much hate???
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,7,"Ok, it was boring at the beginning , it had no story but after the firdt half it was fun! I mean there are clearly way worse movies. And what happends with Jared Leto? Ok his performance wasn't as good as Heath ledger's but it was a pretty good one! This movie dont deserve so much hate. I am not talking about the rating ,the rating is accurate enough but why this hate? WHY?"
" Stock up on Advil.
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,3,"The brief enjoyment I received from my viewing of ""Suicide Squad"" did not come from the film itself. During the skull-splitting climax a character delivers a line so awful, that my cinema actually began to collectively cackle at the tragedy of it. Yes. We were all laughing at just how bad this flick was. Banal, bloated and as boisterous as a sugar-fuelled child, you'll feel your eyes pulling from your head mere minutes in. The damnable squandering of first-class songs is a mere bullet point on the list of frustrating choices made in this production. Characters' motivations are as shallow as a paddling pool and just as we sense we may soon migrate to the deep end the jackhammer editing dunks you on your head. This script, as it is, seems to have been scraped out in only weeks, perhaps in a dim room whilst two sheets to the wind. The talented cast have near-naught to work with. It's difficult to say that David Ayer (director and writer) acted alone, and although he's produced accomplished work in the past, one hopes this franchise and these characters are warranted more time and creativity in cinema to come."
" Great characters, terrible plot.
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,7,"Loved watching Margot Robbie, Jared Leto, and Will Smith. But the plot was so bad and there were way too many characters that they hindered the best characters."
" A mess that doesnt match Batman universe
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,2,"First, its way too long. The first half+ hour is spoiled on a very basic setup of the characters you really cant care about. Quick forced background stories in your face for each. An unrealistic story about using a bunch of criminals to counter other villains. Then theres the superhero/supernatural/way over the top stuff that has no place in a more down to earth Batman universe imho. The main story is just very simple and lame. Another evil alter-ego wants to conquer the world for no given reason. O quite a few vehicle crashes in this movie where everyone steps out alive with no injuries. Also a few unexplained returns from meeting dead. The characters dont match with each other. Mere mortals combined with very powerful god like characters. Somehow it still got a part 2?"
" good
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,8,"Suicide Squad has such star power and superhero connections that I was going to watch it no matter what the user reviews said (I always disregard critic reviews as they rarely are helpful) and feel like many viewers were going to as well. The movie has cool set pieces, action scenes and fantastic costumes."
" Begins well but then becomes unintersting mess
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,4,Rating4/10This film begins well as we get to know various members of the Squad. Sadly the story collapses in the middle and becomes an unintersting special effects laden mess. Viola Davis is ok but doesn't suit the tone of the film.Mediocre
" How a superhero movie should be made
",2019-10-22 00:00:00,7,"At the beginning we are introduced to the Suicide Squad. Presentation sequences for all the members are not long, but detailed enough to understand the origin of every ""villain"", and more information will be added along the movie. The cast is composed by great names, Will Smith and Margot Robbie are the two that pops immediately in my head, but also Jay Courtney as Captain Boomerang with his scottish accent, and Jay Hernandez as El Diablo performed pretty good.Jared Leto's Joker deserve a different paragraph. I don't really know what to think about it: there were some moments during the movie in which I found him brilliant, but most of the time it seemed too forced in his acting and not at all convincing. I have to admit that I have watched this movie after ""The Dark Knight"" (I don't think that there are any words that can describe how amazing was Heath Ledger) and the Joaquin Phoenix's ""Joker"" 2019 movie. I perfectly understand that are completely different, darker. Maybe they wanted to create something closer to the pop culture and they wanted to play a little bit safer this time. However, I can't say that I appreciated the interpretation: the character is annoying and I could not bound with, or feeling any kind of emotion for him.There is a good mix between CGI and stunts scenes and in general, under this perspective the entire movie is very balanced. We get to see the right amount of destruction (that needs to be there in a superhero movie), but at least they did not raze to the ground an entire city like in 2013 ""Man of Steel"". The fight scenes seems credible and dynamic, but the movie leave also space for some dialogues between characters, developing them, even though not everyone has the importance that should have, like Killer Croc. He seems that he does not have any personal story, and he was left aside, so you almost forget is part of the team.Suicide Squad is a big step forward compared to the other DC movies and is worth your time, it feels different, looks amazing, with of course some weak points, and I never thought that I could give seven stars out of ten to this movie. I was pleasantly surprised."
" Ok movie that was jacked up just to get PG13
",2019-10-21 00:00:00,4,"This could have been a great movie but the problem is that they insisted that they get a PG13 movie. They wanted a ""family"" movie. Nothing about the context of this movie fits into a family movie. If your familiar with the original backstory for the characters in the movie it would have been a very dark, black, and HARD R rating at best. There was loads of R rated footage shot but the director always intended for the movie to be a PG13 movie at most, and the studio forced an even softer PG13 rating for there. They think they'll get a wider audience and more ticket sales with a softer rating but it has been proven time and again that harder rated superhero movies actually do better. You want say that Marvel / Disney doesn't do R and they sell a ton of tickets. But Marvel kills WAY more people than DC, they just don't use language or show blood. Beside DC has ALWAYS been darker, and dare I say more realistic. The problem with Suicide Squad is from the start they were more insistent in getting a PG13 rating and toning evening down so much that even a prime time broadcast TV show shows more than Suicide Squad. Even the (unrated) ""Extended Release"" is basically still PG13 and it STILL strips all the life and story out of the movie and leaves it a confused, disjointed, mess of a movie. All the needed footage to make this an 8 or 9 out of 10 was shot and all we can HOPE is they make a fan version of this, since even the director was more concerned about the MPAA rating than telling an authentic story. Even the closing music on the unrated extended release has been censored! Why even use that music to begin with then. It's so obvious what they're saying when even edit it, for credit music, on an unrated version. Why? This is a dark story, that is even darker in its original form; and they insisted in watering it down to try and offend the least amount of people possible. You just pissed off all the people that love the original characters and story. And the goody goody people people are still offended because it's still not family enough and they know what you were editing out anyway. So you're left with a 6/10 movie that could have been 8+/10. Here's hopes the sequel which is taking 4 years for what reasons isn't done the wrong way again, for the same wrong reasons. I can easily saying the studio won't give you enough budget for the sequel because the first film didn't do well enough. Why. The director watered it down till there was nothing left for the sake of a rating and the studio watered it down even further. This is NOT family water, and MOST of the DC Universe ISN'T family material."
" Disappointed
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,4,Way to heavy on the music...Not enough action.. Could have been better.
" Why did i watch this?!
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,3,Awful storyline. Only thing I enjoyed their acting performance and the music.
" Suicidal is making a Marvel - style movie without knowing how to do it
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,1,"This film is still coming from the worst thing that brought the superhero's genre from its horrific joker to its horrible script, the only thing I can stand out from this movie is the cool will smith performance taking that away all else is crap the garbage characters the trash plot and the end crap I don T recommend because I'm not one of them sleeping in the middle of a movie but this got that effect"
" Awesome
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,8,Well what more can I say ? The movie is amazing. Movie Harley Quinn took over. By far the best character. Awesome acting. Well done D.C.
" Complete disappointment!!
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,3,"When I saw the trailer for this I couldn't wait to see it. The trailer is nothing like the movie! I'm still disappointed when I think about how awful this film turned out! Great actors but there's NO STORY/PLOT. U think Jared Leto is going to have this huge part & he's barely in it, pops up here & there but the film is a Complete disaster! They have so much to work with & I have no idea how the end result is this Money wasting film!"
" Bad attempt at creating a guardians of the galaxy movie
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,6,"The movie have some good and enjoyable elements but they are thrown away by much bigger amount of annoying and bad things , leto joker didn't even have the chance to show if he's good or not although he was filling covers and trailers"
" Good because of Harley Quinn
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,5,"I tried to like this film as much as i could but the only thing that keeps me watching is that sweet/crazy Harley Quinn. She's just too good to ignore so i watch the whole film till the end. I believe this film lacks story, like why the hell bad guys would do or sacrifice to achieve something. But i still love Harley Quinn though and thats just enough. I would like to see more Harley Quinn movies with this actress alone."
" It's not that great
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,1,"The plot didn't make sense, Joker was better than it wasn't there because it was ruined by the bad interpretation made, boring, i didn't give any suspense, the very ugly ending"
" Just not good, as in bad.
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,2,"I really wanted to like this film, and even thought it was not as bad as the reviews had made it out after seeing it, but then I watched it again and everything wrong with the film became clear. Some good made-for YouTube scenes do not make up for an awful ending and hideous character development. The ending is particularly bad. Sad in that many of the actors in this movie did what the could with their part, but the center does not hold, it crashes."
" Garbage
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,1,"You know when you see the trailer for a film and you worry that you've seen the best bits of it?This film is a hot mess. An incoherent storyline, characters whose back story makes no sense and bears no relevance to the plot, an underwhelming baddie that posed no threat and you just couldn't take seriously.Above all else, a waste of the talents of many actors in it. Jared Leto seemed like he would be a great Joker, but was in it very little and was essentially an over the top caricature.So very disappointing."
" Simply pathetic
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,2,Such brilliant cast and big budget and yet they failed to made a decent movie. Action sequences were simply woeful and humour was somehow shady. Plus it had the worst joker i would say
" On why I loved the flawed movie anyway
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,7,"The movie wasn't perfect by any means; yes, the story was not so well executed; pacing regarding character development a bit unsteady; plot plain; but what I loved the most watching the movie was the chemistry between the cast so that I had no problem enjoying the movie from the beginning to the end.Also style concept of the whole movie was great just as the costumes, and as much as I love Margot Robbie and her face for Harley Quinn, no one will top the casting choice for Amanda Waller. Viola Davis brought her straight into real life from the comics.I was bothered though that Warner Brothers missed the opportunity to show a great Joker by Jared Leto. I've seen the behind the scenes and I've seen Jared was giving a good Joker-performance backstage, but that's it. He had potential and now receives the hate he does not deserve simply because the production messed up.All in all, the modern and more realistic streetstyle take of Harley and Joker was, to me, a great idea and I had wished to see more of that in future movies. I also wasn't bothered at all by the romance between Harley and Joker as I see this just as another universe out of a dozen DC had come up with. It's an interesting 'what if' scenario after all and the extra scenes of their past matches the original story in some kinda way.Ps.: Katana felt like a not needed accessory though."
" A ""Must not see"" film

" THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE I'VE EVER WATCHED
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,10,Margot Robbie really did that great and she's so hot! Everyone did that perfect and this is really the movie that leaves a good impression!
" Why so Negative?
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,8,"This movie has some really awful reviews and a very disrespectful IMDb star count, which is completely unjustified. First off, Margot Robbie and Will Smith were the PERFECT choice for their respective roles. Secondly, the story and plot are better then reviews would suggest. Now I do believe that Tom Hardy would have made a better Rick Flag, but you can't have the cake and eat it too. Viola Davis is also perfectly cast as well, then that brings me to that Joker. I was truly disappointed in the joker....having limited screen time. From what was shown, it was different and edgy, don't compare to previous jokers, you'll be disappointed. Overall, if you enjoy the DC universe you will love this movie. If you like a movie with a badass assassin and a strong female lead, you will love this movie. Enjoy!"
" Yes, it is as bad as everyone says
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,2,I just started watching this for the second time (my kids wanted to watch it) and I won't be able to make it all the way through. I hope whoever is responsible for this steaming pile of dung got fired. They don't deserve to have a job in the entertainment industry

",2019-08-27 00:00:00,7,"I just watched this again last night, 4th viewing, great flick. I get why it got a bad rep from fan-boys, the whole Green Lantern type ""fighting a dark cloud of evil"" with good thoughts and explosives failure. But the music was awesome. The performances were top-notch. They introduced the characters and made you feel for them. The comedy had good tone. And forgive me but I like the Leto Joker -- he is off his meds and crazy and perfect here. Great movie and fun for fan-boys. I liked it!"
" Slow blast.
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,9,"The film was really a slow one, it may be 'cause it's the first to describe these characters but believe me the only one who shines through the the film is Harley(Margot), she had done wonderful acting even more better than Deadshot (Will) and the story is poor with very little fighting scenes. Whatever DC will shine soon."
" Everyone cosplayed as characters from this movie on halloween back then...god...why ?
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,4,"Honestly, the Joker's design was absolute trash. 100% sure they would've found a better actress to play Harley, instead of annoying-voice-Robbie.
The movie consists of bad action scenes and way too many moments of people eating steak. The storyline is absolute trash, the characters badly developed.
I don't know how stupid the majority of the audience the director thought it would be, but damn, was he kind of right. The amount of people that unironically enjoyed this badly written garbage astounds me.
Does this movie make any sense ? No. Is it worth watching ? To make fun of it, yes."
" Harley Quinn's Love Story
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,4,"Impressed by Margot's acting as Harley. And nothing else.The story is poor. Dialogues and graphics are not on the top level. Even though there are supervillains in the introduction, they are rather funny when in action.The rock music at the beginning is entertaining. The movie is all about the first half. After some time it turns into a children's superhero movie.Somewhat enjoyable. Expect upcoming sequels to be better than this."
" It's not that bad
",2019-08-17 00:00:00,7,"Before I watched this movie, I expected a really bad movie, but in my opinion, it wasn't terrible, will smith was good as deadshot, and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, their characters are the ones that get more development through out the movie, they have an interesting back story, the pacing is good, one of the bad things is the villain, and also the joker, it's a completely different joker, from the comics, and it doesn't work, his design is ridiculous, another bad thing is that some characters that get 0 development"
" A disgrace to the Superhero genre and DC Comics
",2019-08-17 00:00:00,2,"Suicide Squad is a movie made out of total crap. Every aspect of the movie is just disappointing from it's predictable plot to the underveloped characters to it's crappy editing and poorly rendered C.G.I and David Ayer's Direction. Suicide Squad tries a different tone than the previous two DC films with much more humor and fun and it largely fails to deliver. The actors have zero chemistry between them and their characters doesn't connect with me at all and most of their performance are either underwhelming or annoying. Jared Leto's performance as the Joker was great, but he has too little to do with the plot. The most disappointing thing about Suicide Squad is it's action sequences which is the biggest joke of the movie."
" Average movie
",2019-08-16 00:00:00,6,"The characters are really interesting and while you are watching the movie you actually expect an amazing ending fight. Personally, I was disapointed. It was a little boring."
" Good start, then downhill from there
",2019-08-14 00:00:00,2,"The trailer looked great, cast looked great, look and feel great. Starts with a bang, cool, lively and promising. Then.... oh dear. I just couldn't watch Cara D without cringing and the plot was silly and confusing. What a waste of a great cast and premise. What a disappointment!"
" I wanted to rip my eye balls out, this is one of the worst comic book films ever
",2019-08-14 00:00:00,3,"One of the most painful movie watching experiences of my life. This movie is awful, and when I say awful, I mean AWFUL. The story makes no sense. The villain is bland and copy-paste. The characters we want to see are not only given less screen time than expected, but when they are on screen, they are completely opposite of what we have come to expect from these characters. Character development and motivation take a back seat for what is basically a video game story set to screen. Some cool visuals, costumes, and charismatic performances from Smith and Robbie are the only things this movie has going for it. DO NOT WATCH THIS."
" She's Harley and I miss Burton.
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,7,"As a gamer and DC Fan, I have to say that Margot Robbie born to be Harley Quinn. I like her work because this Harley Quinn (Margot) was very similar to the Harley Quinn of the Arkham video games series.Maybe the problem with the movie was the script and I just felt that they wanted to be like MARVEL with all the coloring and sparkling things. I'm that kind of DC fan who likes the ""Tim Burton's Batman"", you know, the dark one, ""Not colored"".As a publicist I have to talk about a marketing rule ""Do always the opposite of your competition"", if Pepsi is blue, Coca-Cola is red. If Marvel is the ""color-fun"" then DC has to keep the dark style. Sometimes I just feel that DC directors just want to ""do it like Marvel"" and maybe they just have to keep the DC Dark Style.I guess everybody remembers the Batman Forever and Batman & Robin. Same mistake, same history, you put color and sparkling things on the Batman world and you will ruin it.I only put 7 to respect the Oscar this movie won and to respect the Margot Robbie Work."
" Deadshot
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,10,This is a great movie and is underrated. My favorite character is Deadshot. Can't wait to see him in his stand alone film.

" Terrible
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,2,"No plot line, I almost fell asleep it was so dull. Just a lot of mindless (and ridiculous) action scenes. Terrible idea for a main villain. None of the jokes were funny. Every shot lasts about a second on average making it havoc on your eyes. Unbelievable characters. Terrible acting from most. Just a hyped up waste of time and money. Save yourself two hours of your life and don't watch it, you have been warned!"
" Disappointing.
",2019-07-30 00:00:00,2,"When this was being made I couldn't wait to see it and I was totally disappointed when I walked out of the cinema. Its the Will Smith show basically, it seem like the studio offered him the part and he agreed only if he was the main star. The joker was not hardly in the movie, the action was poor it was just too much dialogue, The soundtrack was good though and harly Quinn was awesome but Its just another film that DC could of done better and not cut so much out."
" Genuinely don't understand all the bad reviews.
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,10,"This movie is action packed, funny and great to watch from beginning to end. I genuinely don't understand all the bad reviews. I'm usually very cinical when it comes to movies but this is excellent."

Another failed attempt by DC."
" Outlstandinly Entertaining
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,9,"This is one to enjoy as a collector's item. Casting, screenply and effects call for lots of rewinding and multiple viewings. Awesome action, as the squad comes together through the tensions of their situation. There was something to enjoy about each of the characters. The grey line between ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" is well expressed. Even with some disappointment at the end, you can just let go and enjoy this fabulous fantasy."
" poor story
",2019-07-17 00:00:00,5,"I liked the characters, but the story is kinda weak and the final battle with the witch was really quick and looked too easy to be defeated.

So I'm asking this to myself...""why is Ben Afflect in a bat suit?""Okay...let's pretend Ben Affleck is Batman, than wouldn't he have mastered the element of disguise? Could he not have picked a different time to arrest Will Smith?And Jared Leto plays a Joker that makes every Dark Knight fan give up on the Batman series from nauseation.And this is just the first 15 minutes. From there on, watching this was like torture. The only way i would watch a movie as bad as this is with my eyes pried open in a Clock Work Orange like punishment.The thing is this...I love how comics have come to life in movies recently. But even if this was the only movie in this world, I wouldn't watch this."

" jared leto as the joker
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,9,"I've heard to much negative stuff about the joker in this movie. First this movie was supposed to be a dark adult movie. Second I hate hearing that the joker has a character type that actors need to fallow. Joker is psychotic, insane and unpredictable. And jared leto embraced the joker character and made its own crazy persona........ I thought he did an awsome joke, and I was excited they where ganna make a joker and Harley Quinn movie. Then really pissed off that they didn't. Those two where crazy good and they need their own movie."

And actions are all amazing, l just wanna have fun, good comedy movie ."
" Nothing.
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,1,"This god damn stupid film deserves no praise, I've watched it repeatedly to see if I got ANY speck of love for this film but nope. Nothing.
Every scene is edited to look like this super energetic music video with various words and colours splashing out the screen that makes the film look more cool looking than it actually is.The acting is terrible, from Will Smith to Jared Leto. No one in this movie looks like they care, no one is giving anything of quality at all.Every single moment of this film is painful, I will be using this 'disasterpiece' to torture enemies of the state. Jesus christ, it's so horrible.I would not reccomend anyone see this movie unless you want every cell in your body to slowly rot away. I am not at all surprised it's being remade by James Gunn, anything would be better than what we got.I reccomend you watch the animated Suicide Squad movies that seem like actually effort was put into them."
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,3,"Where was the evil-ness????? even the intro credits had heroic music. i wish it had a more evil tone.overall this was a bad movie. bad story, horrible pacing, bloated with needless characters. bad choppy directing. it also tried to add some humor and most of it not only didn't work, but felt very forced, awkward and out of place. some of the jokes were also very lame and cringe-worthy. i like when superhero movies have good comedy like most of the MCU movies, but it really isn't necessary. And I think they did reshoots where they added some of those comedic scenes, and a few times it really seemed like something was just added in the middle of the scene that didn't fit. i also thought the villain was forgettable. she was cool at times but really she was pretty weak (figuratively)there were so many useless characters, actually most of them. i really only liked the joker, harley quinn and deadshot. i loved harley quinn and i wanted to see more of her (figuratively). her character is very intriguing, evil and funny at the same time. jared leto had an interesting take on the joker, which i liked for the most part. he felt intimidating and psychotic in certain scenes. the problem was he was barely in the movie. also, his introduction was non-existent. we are seeing a new actor play the biggest Batman villain, there should have been a build up or some anticipation when we are about to see him for the first time. but they just cut to a scene with him talking to Harley at a table. such a wasted opportunity. for reference, remember the introduction to the joker in the dark knight? that was AMAZING and unforgettable.the other really disappointing thing is that the action was very useless. coming out of the movie i can't think of one action scene that stood out. they had a few cool slow motion moments but creative action was non-existent. after watching it a second time, i conclude that none of the action in this movie is good. it is horrible. i could pick 100 action scenes from the different marvel movies that are better than any scene in here. and that's not an exaggeration. i wanted to see them work together. but they didn't work together at all, in a sense of using each other's skills in combination, etc. the only used actual teamwork one time in the entire movie.i was really into the first 30 minutes-ish of this movie. there were lots of cool scenes and i liked learning who the characters were and what they were about. but then they kept adding more characters as the movie went on, new characters i had no interest in, while also taking up any time the original characters would have had to be developed. and some of the lines in this movie are laughable. there are a lot of questionable parts and things you can make fun of for not making sense. this movie was a huge disappointment. i could have fallen in love if it was done right.at least this movie gave me a new awesome song: Heathens by Twenty One Pilots. good for you, movie. (2 viewings)
SPOILERS
the end battle with the huge world destruction is becoming a very typical of DC movies. it's like a normal thing now. the funny thing is, it's so commonplace that they actually had a montage of world destruction not even halfway through the movie. as if the city getting destroyed isn't a big thing any more, let's just sum it up really quick with some good music.something that really bothered me is one of many scenes that were choppy. flag takes june to her brother, they don't say why but i think everyone assumes she's there to stop him. it then immediately cuts to him saying she bolted. wasn't sure why that happened. and even thought it was ""explained"" later, it still could have been done better. the real problem comes later in the movie with the ""reveal"" of what really happened. but the only real difference is that they showed a bomb they were going to use to kill the brother. everything else was basically the same so they didn't really tell us anything new. so why replay all those scenes again as if we need to understand what really happened. when they started showing it again i was excited to see what really happened but it was nothing. smhso many times they show the enchantress destroying stuff across the world, satelites in space and around america using completely destructive beams. but then she fights her enemies with swords and fists. so many things like this make no sense. the mind control stuff was such a weak attempt. and the way they kill the big dude and end the final battle is so lame. basically just explode it. so why couldn't that be done in a million other ways. it was never mentioned that they need to get close to blow it up. and to kill the enchantress, they basically just tricked her cause she's really dumb. pretend to be on her side for 5 seconds then slice her while saying one of the worst lines in the movie: ""There's just one teeny problem, you messed with my friends."" Heart slice, game over....... lame over. omg and let's not forget the laughable scene when the black chick kills all of her innocent employees. lolololol. i just convinced myself to drop it from 2.5 to 1.5. I was only gonna go down to 2.0 but there is just too much bad and very little good in this moviethe batman cameo was exciting."
" Great Movie
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,10,Amazing movie with great characters...its not Gone with the wind but it's not supposed to be. Fun journey and that's why I own it.
" Disappointment.
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,1,"Honestly, I was so thrilled about this movie when it came out. When I saw I was like what the heck is this? I didn't understand what was happening and all and the love story between Harley and joker was a teenage dream. I thought I would see some characteristics of their toxic relationship but nah, it was made just to make the teen girls go crazy.Also, why make the joker so handsome? I mean, they represented him like he was every girl's dream. Perfect everything. What's wrong with those tattoos? It was ridiculous...The only thing I loved about this was dead shot and Harley's acting. Everything else was a mess."
" Suicide Squad is a hot mess.
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,4,"Suicide Squad is a hot mess. I ceased to care halfway through. Harley Quinn and the Joker were the only characters that piqued my interest, but they had to share the screen with a slate of ensemble cast characters that seemed extraneous. The film attempted to create the same dynamic as Guardians of the Galaxy, aping the light tone, the classic rock soundtrack, and the ensemble cast, yet it failed to capture it's fun and entertainment."
" Seen the regular Version... But Extended is a whole no Film Experience!
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,7,"I think I made a review once before, and I may have also said this: but 11 minutes more , in the extended edition, is the difference between a low 6 and a solid 7. Just more action, fully character lines and development. And just more enjoyable. Even when I saw this in theatres, my friend and I swear it was cut down even more, to under 2 hours. But extended is the way to go. Still enjoyable, the characters are still fun, especially as an old school Dc fan, and those 11 minutes moved this film up a notch in my book. 7/10"
" Margot Robbie Steals The Show
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,7,"Suicide Squad (2016)Plot In A Paragraph: A secret government agency recruits some of the most dangerous incarcerated super-villains to form a defensive task force. Their first mission: save the world from the apocalypse.This was not as bad as I remembered. I'll say this right off the bat, Margot Robbie not only, totally steals this movie, she stops it from being outright awful. I'd watch a solo movie with Robbie as Harley Quinn any day.The first 20 minutes were decent, as was the last 20 minutes. It's what is in between that's the problem. Smith was ok as Deadshot, but his performance was a bit too Will Smith for me. I thought Leto's Joker showed promise for future movies and for the first time ever, I did not hate Jai Courtney.I really enjoyed the rock soundtrack too.Suicide Squad became Will Smith's highest grossing domestic movie. Grossing $325 million at the domestic box office to end the year, the 9th highest grossing movie of 2016."
" Jared Leto ruins the show.
",2019-06-11 00:00:00,6,"I admit, there were some poor director choices that made the movie worse that it could have been, there were scenes that could have been done better and a more interesting ending...BUT, Jared Leto did not manage to fill the shoes of Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger at all. He ruined the most memorable and unique character that DC has in store by acting so damn artificial it made me wanna puke. He was very poor, that laugh was miserable and he did not succeed in pulling the characteristic Joker Face Changer for once. Anyway, his lines were also awful, but that is the director's problem and it shows us how a great movie potential can be wasted by making some very important wrong moves."
" Worst Hero-movie in years
",2019-06-08 00:00:00,4,"I missed the film on the big screen, and now I'm glad I did not spent any money paying to view this movie.
I enjoy very much action films, and I love superhero movies as much as I enjoyed comics when I was a kid, but the plot of Suicide Squad is so chaotic and poorly developed that it is hard to believe that someone agreed to participate in this movie. The direction is messy and the SF and CGI are really expensive, and somehow wrong and misplaced. The actors try a little bit too hard to make the movie actually work, but unfortunately they don't succeed.
In my eyes this is the most expensive bad B-series movie in the last 20 years. A real waste of money!"
" Margot Robbie saved the film

" An iconic worst film of all time
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,1,"I hope this never gains ""cult status"" because it's just plain bad in every way. The best thing about this film is I didn't pay to watch it, someone else did. The personified version of this film would be that annoying kid in middle or high school who was trying so hard to be edgy or ""punk"" and wore a mish mosh of clothes their mom bought them from hot topic or the sale rack at jcpenney - when you asked them what their favorite punk band was they said nickelback. There you go, that's what this movie is.
Waste of money and talent."
" Like an average TV episode
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,2,"Pretty poor, Margot Robbie is in good form here but that's about it. Will Smith tries to make his character appear deeper than just the standard bad guy but instead just makes him seem mentally challenged. The others are underused as the studio clearly decided to focus on Smith, Robbie and Jarred Leto, doing his best to create his own version of the joker. Unfortunately this iteration of the Joker falls completely flat, lacks any sense of menace and thankfully disappears prior to the end of the movie."
" No match in comparison to any other super villain movie
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,4,"Cast is not bad, Margot Robbie is excellent in her role as Harley Quinn, but the story is lame and every time Cara Delevigne is on screen you hope the movie was not only called ""suicide squad"", but that they actually committed suicide right there on the spot and end it all without having to spend another 90 minutes watching this crap. If you plan to watch it: don't. If you have watched it, you'll have forgotten it the next day."
" A fun adventure!
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,5,"It finally came that day. I watched it as soon as the movie went online. I didn't really expect it before I saw it, because it's been 2 months since I've been out and I've been trying not to buy too much spoilers. I want to tell you about this team. The American government wants to gather a team against any threat. These are the worst and most psychotic people in the world. And what happens happens after the incident in Midway City, the government begins to gather this team. Now, if you understand this part, let's come to my own views. I see I like this movie. Whether it was acting, soundtrack, Batman and Flash, they were all good details.I don't think this movie has ever been the enemy. OK Enchantress is a powerful evil, but this enemy has no depth in the story. Who's Enchantress? or his brother? who are they? They're coming out of one. Enchantress awakens his brother and ransoms the world. They have all the bad ends to conquer the world. For example: General Zod had a depth and character instinct. But here, we put a couple of enemies, bird on top of the air to make a origin. As most people say, if the enemy is not well-rendered in a movie, that movie is bad. Yes, that's the right view we've seen everywhere. For example: Avengers: Age Of Ultron, Ultron was a terrible villain. I mean, the movie didn't need an enemy anyway. For example: if the movie is a cake, add the enemy to this movie remains in the sauce. The second problem, I see the characters in the world or something always"" very bad "" was touted as. When I saw the movie, I said how these guys are enemies. You're bad, okay, maybe if you're bad viewers will hate you, but a little bit of people do not leave the perception of ""villan"" these characters. I say this as someone who has played the Arkham series, these characters are not like this. In the movie, Harley Quinn, Deathshot, El Diablo, always tried to add a human being. Okay, do you think these guys are Batman's enemies? I'm not sure about that. By the way, the Deadshot Batman is like this, Batman makes him Robin :)The second shortcoming of the movie is that these characters are ""bad"" parts of the movie can not be transferred well. The third problem is, I'm saying it clearly and clearly. I don't like Will Smith being a Deadshot. Why? This guy already has a lot of drama movies, and when I look at this guy, I don't see him bad. How's that Deadshot? He's one of Batman's enemies in the game, but he's the angel you know here. I just felt sorry for him when he was fighting Batman, that's all! The event in one mask. It bothered me that Deadshot wore that famous mask very little. Why did you choose Will Smith? If I say he's not wearing a mask, it's a place. So he can see his face and make a profit. Well, never with me don't be angry. If they've never brought Will Smith money into this movie, then drown me here! so, I'm sure.I like Margot Robbie. I had prejudices at first, but he played really well. As for Joker, what is this guy doing in this movie? Okay, he wants to find Harley, but I'm confused by an Enchantress Joker. And they put him in the second role. The Joker and Harley relationship is not so deep and magnificent. I didn't see any depth in the relationship between them. I'm glad the film was about the universe. I'm really happy to see things like that in DC. The movie was carried by Deadshot and Harley Quinn. The soundtrack was very good. I mean, I was good at visual merits, but I don't know why the budget didn't say so much. But after all these words, I realized that there was really some improvement in DC movies. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (Ultimate Edition) you need to compare it with, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (Ultimate Edition) is better, but in caring for the characters in this movie I would say that is a very entertaining movie. I didn't notice the cut scenes as they were in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. I mean, the movie's gone. I'm looking forward to DC's upcoming films. In the meantime, I'm glad that the Extended Cut version came to Blu-ray. I recommend you to watch the movie, but know that there are mistakes in cookies and logic. enjoy the movie...⭐ 100/64"
" I disliked it so much I actually signed up for an account to give it 2*
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,2,"Bad script
Horrible plot
Cheesy one-linersI pity Jared Leto who played this lousy, boring, predictable, version of joker right after Heath Ledger. Jared will go down history as 'the boy who tried to fill a man's shoes'.The producers and director just cured insomnia."
" Would like to change my review
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,1,Gave it one star but would like to officially give it -3 stars if possible please.It's one of the worst films I've ever seen. How on earth it made $750m I will never know.
" So much to say about this film but not at all worth the effort
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,1,"This is an appalling film.
Jared Leto is awful. Truly the worst 2-dimensional performance. And all the more painful to watch when he's doing ""Oooh I'm crrraaaazzzyyyyyy"" Nothing short of embarrassing. Please, never put him in those metal teeth again.
The Aussie delivers every single line in a mumble. He's lost and his part is completely forgettable. Oh and his weapon of choice is a metal boomerang (?!??)
No idea what Harley Quinn is doing. She's just a bit mental which surely isn't good enough to be a part of a 'superhero' hit squad.
Will Smith is brilliant - he goes along literally as Will Smith being dumbfounded by what's going on around him.Really uninteresting characters and you don't care what happens to them."
" Searching for depth and meaning without finding it.
",2019-05-09 00:00:00,4,"This movie developed so many opportunities for new and interesting territory, but in an obvious effort to avoid cliché at all costs, it failed and ends in empty disappointment. Bored throughout the movie."
" Quick and to the point (not their fault you missed the point)
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,7,"A much needed break from the typical 'superheroes united' films with characters being previously introduced in other standalone films.
Being able to fit a background story for each anti-hero and explain their involvement in the suicide squad was crucial to the overall team chemistry, and was very well delivered. Unfortunately the 2 hour run-time limited the action parts significantly (but given DC's inability to create quality CGI, perhaps it was for the better)
In the end, lack of plot twists, unresolved mysteries, and information overflow allowed everything else to work together seamlessly."
" Need to see joker
",2019-04-26 00:00:00,6,The joker character is good but we need to see him more in movie

" Jared Leto knew what he was doing as the Joker!
",2019-04-26 00:00:00,3,"The Joker maybe one of the best villains out there, but what they wanted to do is to make an unusual version of him and it doesn't matter if he did good or bad, but only I can tell what Jared Leto was trying to do, and if you guys didn't like his version, there's always more DCEU films coming out that Jared can get better at playing the Joker."
" A pleasant suprise
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,7,I'd heard quite a few negative comments about the film before I saw it so I went in with low expectations but I really did enjoy it
" Not that bad
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,7,"The movie overall is ok. A fun movie to go with your friends. Once.
From an actor point of view the performances were great. You can see Will Smith had a backstory. His acting was clear, simple and very effective. Same with Margot Robbie. Not only she was stunningly beautiful but she created a very charismatic Harley Quinn. Viola Davis has a very strong presence on screen and is very precise. Jay Courtney and Jay Hernandez are doing a very good job too. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje was the counterpoint in some funny scenes and he did a great job.
Cara delevingne was quite average and I think she was casted because she looks very good on screen and no one can deny that.
I think Jared Leto was a casting mistake. He is one of the best actors in the world in my view. He can create a whole universe around him with just one role. But Joker was just not for him. He didn't brought anything new to the character, he didn't surprise me with anything. It was just there...
The story was strange. Amanda Waller ( Violla Davis) is bringing a witch to help them to fight a ""New Superman"" . Then she is making a ""Suicide Squad"" with some bad characters from the DC Universe to help with that . But the witch then turns out the be the real villain in this movie. And then all the bad guys from the Suicide Squad are sent to rescue her and lately to stop the witch. All of them have a device in their neck that will kill them if they disobey.
There are so many questions unanswered. How did Amanda Waller ( Violla Davis) survive after she was hung upside down and has a tentacle around her head. Why did Enchantress give them a second chance after her brother was killed by the Suicide Squad and she was so close to the world domination? How does Harley Quinn, a psychopath with a bat, manage to fool one of the most powerful creatures in the universe, a creature who can put visions in their minds. Why did Captain Boomerang come back so randomly after he leaves the bar. And so many more.
Anyway, there were some touching scenes that can make those questions go away very fast. The Joker( Jared Leto) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) scene where she is jumping in a water tank for him. The scene were Killshot (Will Smith) has to shoot Harley Quinn. The scene were Harley Quinn is crying in the rain after Joker's helicopter crash. And my favourite: the bar scene.
That scene was better than the whole movie for me. There you can see the background of the characters and why they are doing what they do. Especially Diablo. That character is amazing.
All in all if you like the DC Universe, tons of different and distinctive characters in the same movie and Will Smith killing monsters this is the movie for you."
" The 'Dirty Dozen' with super-villains
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,7,"After the death of Superman those in power worry how the Earth would cope if the next super-powered being to turn up used their power to defeat rather than help humanity. To that end Task Force X, AKA the Suicide Squad, is established; a group made up of the most dangerous super-villains who have been captured! Of course they cannot be trusted but with an explosive charge placed in their necks they might just behave. When a threat emerges they are led by Col Rick Flag to confront that threat... which just happens to involve the woman Flag loves.Even before I watched this I'd heard it was pretty terrible... I wouldn't say it was that bad but it could have been so much better. Too much of the film's opening was dedicated to showing us how the various villains got caught; something that wasn't really necessary. Then when the action started much of it was too dark... as in it was hard to see what was happening. Tonally it wasn't dark enough; these are meant to be super-villains but the film didn't seem that violent... it would have been better had it been as violent as 'Kick-Ass' or even 'Dredd' but I guess the makers wanted a teen-friendly rating. The cast are solid enough; Margot Robbie stole just about every scene she was in with her performance as the crazy and dangerous, but still likeable Harley Quinn; Jared Leto impressed as The Joker, although his character wasn't in the Squad and was sorely underused. Overall I'd say this was entertaining enough but if you expect something great you are likely to be disappointed."
" Surprise
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,10,The joker is different. The team works together as usual to fight for their independence. It's a great movie.
" Could have been better
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,6,"It was OK. Like seriously, it could have been better, and I am sure I am not the only one thinking that. I would have liked to see more of Jared Leto's Joker, he was very good. Somehow nowadays they like to make movies very dark, sometimes it was hard to see what was happening. I seem to have a ""problem"" with ""all star"" movies, not the first one I don't love (like Sin City I didn't like at all)."
" Not that good , these comic book adaptions are all starting to wear thin .
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,6,"Interesting characters with no plot and with scenes that are predictable with not much excitement , jered leto's performance as the joker was the only highlight, his performance stood alone next to previous portraits of the character other than that the film is flat and unremarkable"
" It's entertaining
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,8,"I actually enjoyed this film, I know the plot was stupid but overall I enjoyed the cast and my personal favourite is captain boomerang he made me laugh a lot, I really wanted to see what his fantasy was when enchantress was messing with the squads heads."
" Funny jokes, bad plot
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,5,"I think the action was a fun time, can't say the same about the plot. The plot was unfocused and was just not making sense. On the other hand I'll say its a cool action flick with cool music and GREAT CAST!!"
" Boring actually !!!!
",2019-04-03 00:00:00,2,"Idea was okay of bringing some hard hitters to fight some supernatural entity but nothing worked out...story telling was not good, the hard hitters were bad except Harley Quinn, she would have suited the real Joker (Heath Ledger)...this joker was a joke in every way...nothing was good about this movie, wasting some potential like Will Smith and Margot Robbie and one of the best character DC has ever made, THE JOKER...what a waste !!"
" Completely bland and did not entertain me in the slightest
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,2,"Suicide Squad supposedly directed by David Ayer, is a film that experienced a large amount of issues with its production. From studios getting involved to the director almost leaving, I'm surprised this movie had slight coherence. To say the least after watching this movie I was angry. This movie is the definition of false advertising as multiple scenes in the trailer did not appear in the film. Mainly the joker who had little to no screen time. Everything from the action sequences to the characters were completely bland and did not entertain me in the slightest. And Cara Delevingne as the villain... why. There were two decent things about this film being Margot Robbie and Will Smith who gave convincing performances, so therefore I give DC's Suicide Squad a 2. This film was incredibly hyped for such a long period of time with so much marketing. Focus on the actual film next time DC."
" Jared Leto as The Joker?? That's a joke in itself!!
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,4,"Not a lot to say really! The film was mediocre at best. Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman and Will Smith were good but that's it really. The story was very poor and some of the characters were not convincing at all, mostly Jared Leto as The Joker..., Really, what were they thinking?!? He was awful, painful to watch in fact! I just wouldn't bother if I was you!"
" its entertaining
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,8,"I liled it I purchased it I watched it !!!!
All the charactees were interesting all had their own quality...amusing music was great..."
" Big budget Big stars BIG FAIL
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,2,It was like watching a long trailer for a movie I got he feeling the director got carried away with his budget made the movie far far to long then had to cut it down to a length that better suited cinemas and as a result made it just series of disjointed clips. Most of it is filmed in really poor lighting which might have worked in the cinema but on the small screen it really doesn't so many scenes are to dark to see what's happening. It's an odd thing that many films which have a star studded cast turn out to be the worst films I've watched. At least I watched it on Netflix so only wasted time watching it. I gave it 2 stars because I did manage to watch it all the way through
" Top 5 worst movies I've ever seen
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,1,"If you take the worst individual character plot lines from every movie you've ever seen, and amalgamate them together into one single, unifying incoherent plot, you have a film with more depth than Suicide squad.If you are looking for soft core porn then Margot's performance in this may meet that benchmark but this can be achieved with a YouTube highlight reel, you're welcome."
" Review
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,8,"""Suicide Squad"" is a superhero film, where a U.S. officer decides to assemble a team of dangerous, incarcerated supervillains for a top-secret mission. I liked the trailer of this movie and also the actors that will play there, thus I waited for its release with great enthusiasm. However, I can say that I liked only some parts of this movie. Despite the current situation where all these superheroes need to do their secret mission, it also demonstrates the superheroes lives separately. Each hero's life is interesting, and the most obvious drawback of this movie is that it is too short for the viewer for understanding them entirely. There are overall seven superhero characters, and I liked the lives of 4 of them. In particular the pair of Harley Quinn and Joker, Deadshot and El Diablo. I liked their stories, however, it was too short for me, and I wanted to see more. Yes, we all know that all this kind of movies, where all superheroes gather with each other, the audience can see only the mission that they do, however, there are new characters, whose movies we don't have. It will be preferable to see separate movies of these characters too and only after that watch this one, without background information about their lives. It will be more meaningful and full movie. Nevertheless, I again want to mention that I liked their stories, and I hope that we will see some separate movies too about their lives."

" Overhyped mediocre garbage.
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,5,"This movie was fun in a stupid way. However, it's still pretty garbage. The things I liked were Jared Leto as The Joker, since it was so bad that it was good. Everything was kinda passable and there were cool things to see like some of the action, other characters interact (might I add they were somewhat forgettable), and some other things of course. However, the lighting sucked. The script was mediocre at best. The structure of this film sucks. There was potential for this movie to be good and just it's thrown away. 5/10."
" Raised up by low expectations
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,8,"I was curious about this movie, but not really excited to see it. Then it got generally bad reviews from critics and viewers alike. Caught on free streaming. Will Smith and Margot Robbie pretty much carry the movie, it is an entertaining romp, the plot makes as much sense as any superhero movie, bad guys were sufficiently creepy. If you were expecting great cinema or deep meaning from this, well, I just don't know what to say."
" Suicide Squad Review
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,9,"Machiavellian government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) has a plan to deal with the sudden, Superman-heralded ""metahuman"" threat to the world: coerce the globe's deadliest bad guys into an emergency super-team. And when Midway City becomes the ravaged heart of a plot to extinguish humanity, that's exactly what she does, with expectedly unexpected results.
If Marvel has the best superheroes, so the prevailing geek-logic goes, then DC has the coolest villains. So it's only sensible they're finally placed front, centre and in the firing line. Filling its entire super-team with previously unseen antagonists, Suicide Squad represents a Flash-speed sprint of a catch-up for the rapidly forming DC Cinematic Universe. And, on that front at least, it's a real hoot.It's a real hoot.
Deadshot, ""the most wanted hitman in the world"", is delivered with heat-of-the-action poise and a generous side order of sass by Will Smith, who couldn't look happier stepping back from his above-the-title dominance to join this motley ensemble and coolly put bullets in brains.
Then there's Harley Quinn, the Jokerette, if you like; though ""crazier than him, and more dangerous"", we're warned. Margot Robbie, skipping daintily about in pants hotter than hell's sauna, isn't quite allowed to completely steal this show - but she certainly borrows it from time to time, and repays you with enough interest to make that mooted Harley stand-alone an enticement.
Plus, among others, we have the tinnie-swigging, stick-hurling Captain Boomerang, which finally sees Jai Courtney flexing his rough charisma on screen; and flame-moulding gang-banger Diablo, the team's unlikely conscience in the impressively intense, tat-etched form of Jay Hernandez.
Margot Robbie isn't quite allowed to completely steal this show - but she certainly borrows it from time to time.
It's quite the roll call. And, despite the rich material, director David Ayer is a brave man to marshal this Dirty Half-ish-Dozen. Thinking he was making the ""funny, smart-talking, cool little brother"" to Batman v Superman, he found himself tasked with turning back the wave of negativity that smashed Zack Snyder's Dawn Of Justice.
More used to spelunking in the man-caves of the testosteronic psyche with the likes of End Of Watch and 2014's underrated war movie Fury, Ayer might seem an unlikely candidate to rescue a comic-book blockbuster series, but, like his unpredictable, mismatched characters, he pulls it off with gritty-flashy aplomb.
Well, for the most part. Whatever the truth behind the reasons for additional shooting (standard procedure, or last-minute Deadpool-style humour injection?) you can't help but inhale the sweaty waft of 11th-hour scrambling in what proves to be a scrappy final edit. False starts, oddly placed flashbacks, clunky cameos (Ben Affleck's Batman, Ezra Miller's Flash) and a muddled chronology detract from the grungy, kooky DayGlo-splashed fun, and it takes a good 45 minutes (plus the mystifyingly late introduction of what turns out to be one complete non-event of a character) for the set-up to stop flapping and the action proper to kick in. Also, in striving to find a threat deadly enough to warrant asking bad guys to save the world, the film's answer is less than satisfying. We get little more than just another posturing villain with vague plans for world domination via a big, swirling mass of CGI.
Still, at least elsewhere there's a proper bad guy to chew on. Though only a wild card, occasionally capering in and out of the main plot, Jared Leto's incarnation of the Joker is essential to its success. Where Heath Ledger's version was scarred, shabby and countercultural, Leto's has a smooth, blingy gangsta swagger; a modern take on the way the original comic-book creation riffed on '30s mobsters. But it's not his swish, purring style and elegant, slo-mo cackle that really hooks you, it's something we've never seen before: the Joker in love. Here's a fascinatingly jagged new angle (cinematically at least). It's unsettling and compelling - almost enough to make you wish it were more than a subplot.
But there's more to come, surely? Judging by what Ayer's pulled off here, you can bet there will be."
" 1 good thing
",2019-03-19 00:00:00,3,The only good part of this movie is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. that's it.
" Really enjoyable untill you think about it!!
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,10,"Suicide Squad is a mediocre movie. The story of this movie is pretty decent, but the screenplay sucks.
When I first came to know about this group, it had something which made it different from Avengers or Justice League or any other Suphero group. It was made by all villains, or we can say negative character. But the movie just made everyone so good. They were supposed to be the villains.
The film started pretty good, but then it all fades away. Some point of the movie doesnt even make sense. I think i am expecting pretty much from DC, after Dark Knight Triology.
Sigh...."
" Awesome
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,9,"Good movie, good acting, memorable characters, nicely paced and action packed. Hope they make a sequel and love the characters."
" Not that great
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,5,"Suicide Squad came out in 2016 and stars Will Smith, Margot Robbie(both were in Focus in 2015),Cars Delavagie,Jai Courtney and Viola Davis and tells the story about supervillians who are teamed up and have to save the world .This film is so hard to follow and very choppy. Margot Robbie was great as Harley Quinn and Will Smith was good too. Jared Leto is barely in this film as the Joker. The special effects are good and I liked the soundtrack but this film is no Spiderman 2 or XMen2.C-Ben Affleck makes a 5 minute cameo as Batman."
" Ughhhh!
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,3,I tried so hard to like this New York sized dumpster fire. Its just so bad. And not the good kind of bad that becomes a cult classic. Its just sooo bad! The trailer was cool. So I guess that's something.
" Huge disappointment, way to corny
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,3,"I was so excited for this movie and had great expectations because the Joker is included in the film. I was so disappointed with how little of the Joker and Harley Quinn was in the movie. I thought they made the Joker look pretty gangster, and I did like the some of the scenes he was in. I thought Letto did a pretty decent job as the joker, some of his lines were delivered poorly though.I hated the characters in this movie, except for the Joker and Harley. Will Smith did a great job acting in the film, but his character was lame. All the other characters were also super lame, there has been so many movies with someone that can shoot fire out of their hands or someone that looks like an animal. This movie also had too much CGI and didn't have a solid story to follow."
" Could have been far better
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,6,"This is the result of not having enough time to fully give these characters time to breathe and some much needed backstory so I care for them. Instead of trying to compete with Marvel and rush things, take some time and develop each character before throwing darts against a wall and see what hits.Margo Robbie shines as well as Will Smith. Villain was not used well and very mediocre as usual."
" Is it really that terrible?
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,1,"Yes. Yes, it is. In fact, this is probably one of the worst movies I've ever watched. So, for the love of God and whatnot, don't bother."
" Trailer made it look good
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,2,The Bohemian Rhapsody trailer was awesome. And that cut Leto scene. The one where he's gonna hurt her really really bad. That made it look promising. But The movie was really really bad tho.
" A good balance to hero-centric films like The Avengers and Justice League.
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,6,"Perhaps the most controversial film of this summer, Suicide Squad (2016) tells a story that is necessary to highlight the eventual superhero team of the Justice League (2017). While I am aware of the real-life drama surrounding the film, including Jared Leto's method acting, director David Ayer's uncouth comments, and the fandom's revulsion of its negative critical reception, I will try and give an unbiased review here. After all, sometimes the greatest art can stand apart from the artists who create it. Decades from now, most will have forgotten the controversy, resorting to Wikipedia for a reminder.In the realm of superhero films, the motif has always been a dichotomy of extremes. Good vs. evil. In reality, things aren't nearly as clear-cut as this. Sure, there are those who do wrong and those who do right, but each side will have their own motivations. What Suicide Squad does is break down the stereotype of the villain. No longer are they purely the psychotic mayhem-inducing individuals who seek world domination. Through this film, we see that the driving force behind these villains is plain and simple. Human, even. It's love. Love drives Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) to endure the Joker's abusive relationship. Love motivates Deadshot (Will Smith) to do whatever it takes to see his daughter. They are human, flaws and all.Now, I do agree that the plot was confusing at times and the objectives of the team didn't usually make sense, but perhaps the biggest weakness of this film was due to the number of characters. With a two-hour runtime, it's difficult to get into the full backstory of everyone in the Squad. It's clear that Deadshot and Harley Quinn are the stars of the show, but there are a few surprises, especially with El Diablo (Jay Hernandez). In an Avengers-esque film like this one, it would have been nice to give each villain their own standalone film before bringing them together, so I suppose we'll just have to wait for any sequels to flesh out the other characters instead.A good balance to hero-centric films like The Avengers and Justice League, I give Suicide Squad 3.0 stars out of 5."
" Mind numbing
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,2,"I didnt have high hopes for it in the first place but I kind of hoped it would be good, sure enough it was by far the worst and disappointing DC movie.With all these memorable characters from the comics in the end you dont get a good backstory for the characters besides Harley Quinn and deadshot, so it was a wasted opportunity there. Harley quinn of course got a lot of screen time and I think people exaggerate when they say she was amazing she tried too hard in my opinion. And the joker was just added in the mix which was unnecessary and just a waste of time. With the avengers you see that click the characters have with each other, you dont get that feeling at all with suicide squad,although great cast assemble, no chemistry whatsoever.The plot was stupid, and the jokes were just there.... the soundtrack though great music it didn't fall in sync with the movie.All in all great waste of time"
" Arrow ripoff
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,1,This movie just totally destroyed the arrow suicide squad. That deadshot was so much better! Floyd Lawton is God!
" A dumpster fire
",2019-02-28 00:00:00,1,"The beginning of the DCEU attempting to be like Marvel, most comparable to 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. This film feels truly amateur, with the lighting sometimes being so dark you could barely see, to eye popping colors that feel out of place. The acting is as good as it can be with what the actors had to work with. The villain is not well set up at all, and the finale feels unsatisfying since it can be identically compared to 'The Amazing Spider-man', 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' and 'Teenage mutant ninja turtles (2014). This film is not unique in the slightest and is overall a very disappointing next step into this attempt at a cinematic universe."
" Mediocre
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,6,"A good movie but could have been better. Margot Robbie nailed it as Harley Quinn. This movie is a complete mixture of action, comedy and thrill. Everyone played their character very well. Captain Boomerang was hilarious too. But it could have been better. Jared Leto's joker was fine. Still it serves a complete package. You will be entertained from the beginning till the end. You will never get bored. It's really fun to watch."
" Thrilling action DC blockbuster
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,9,"This is a Will Smith movie. He has the best lines, is in nearly every scene and ultimately comes across as a huge righteous hero. But it is also a really fun blockbuster with all the bells and whistles you expect from DC and Marvel, brilliant special effects, fast action, fast cars and aeroplanes, lots of stunts, blazing firefights and punches, explosions, amazing props, and massive backdrops. Two classy classic villeins for this one too. Seems all the action I read as a 10 year old in comic books is now coming to life in this ever expanding universe. Even The Joker is in this pic, and I'll be honest, a whip cracking fellow he is! For any fans of this genre, Suicide Squad must be welcome news indeed."
" A joke that never pays off.
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,4,"I saw this movie after it was out in theatres because I feared it would be one of those CGI nightmares. I was mostly right, but I didn't dislike for the reasons I thought I would. It was fun and had some humor. It wasn't boring or overbearing in content. It just seemed like the editing was off. Warner Bros were freaking out at the time and unsure, but they probably cut a little too much.All and all, not bad. It could've been much better."

I liked Harley Quinn and deadshot was ok but other than that the rest of the lineup was just aweful. The plot is one of the dumbest I have seen in a movie in a long time. I can't believe they are making a sequel. How can it get any crappier than the first but guess we will see but I won't cuz I will not waste 2 more hours on this crap.

" Too Jewwy
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,3,"I did not like this movie... It was too Jewwy in every aspect that you could possibly stereotype. Not only do screen-writers need to try something difference for once, they need to stop their obvious efforts at socially-engineering a population attempting to try being an audience. They need to stop trying to be so ""PC"". It is just so ""fake"" to the point that we should charge their casting-agents with hate-crimes for stalking a cast down according to desired-stereotypes of their skin-colors and ethnicities. Just racism by these ""chosen-ones"" who control the global-media-monopoly.."
" This DC Extended Universe movie is for the kids/teens
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,6,"The movie has some good attempts. The idea of a 'Suicide Squad' sounds fun, some members of it maybe have potential, probably mostly Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie).
But overall everything is too half-hearted. A forgettable movie considering the DCEU, Man Of Steel and Batman v Superman were better.
Also what they did to The Joker should be illegal. Absolutely atrocious insult portraying the character like that.
Overall it is watchable, just don't expect too much of it."
" This is not Suicide Squad.
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,1,"Suicide Squad stars Margot Robbie, Will Smith, Jared Leto, Viola Davis, and Jai Courtney. It is also directed by David Ayer who directed movies like Harsh Times and End of Watch. The first time I heard about Suicide Squad was from watching Batman Assault on Arkham. In that movie Task Force X also known as Suicide Squad has to sneak into Arkham and grab a flash drive that the Riddler has. And when I heard about them doing a Suicide Squad movie I was excited even the trailer had me pump for the movie. I didn't see it in theatres, but I got it on Blu ray and I was ready to go I was excited, and afterwards the movie left me disappointed. First off I don't think anyone involved producing, directing, or writing knows anything about Suicide Squad. This is not what the Suicide Squad should look like. The Suicide Squad should be about criminals who are forced to cooperate with the government while also remaining villains. Instead were left with a movie where they resolve there differences with themselves and the government and they eventually save the day and are respected. The writing is terrible that it sounds like someone who read Suicide Squad, but instead of going for a hardcore Suicide Squad we have what Doctor Evil might say a mini or the diet coke of Suicide Squad, just one calorie. I love David Ayer as a director. He's made some fantastic movies, but him directing this wasn't the best fit for him and I believed he did have a plan, but that idea was scrapped. I was hoping for an R rated version, but instead we have a PG-13 version filled in with jokes that are trying way to hard to impress the audience, but they fall flat on their head. Joker has always been a big edition to Batman and Suicide Squad, but when he's on screen he's covered in tattoos who looks more like Scarface than the clown prince of crime. And he's not in the movie that long more like thirty minutes and vanishes until he shows up again. Even the extended cut of the film can't save this trash of a film. I could go on and on about what went wrong with Suicide Squad, but the point I'm trying to make is that watch Batman Assault on Arkham instead of this trash because that is what Suicide Squad is supposed to be not this."

The movie does not have a fearful or scary enemy to fight against, would rather have Joker as a bad guy, instead of Enchantress. Although, the humor in the movie, is perfectly fine, since the beginning until the end of it. However it could have done better...(one example) exploring Killer Croc, Captain Boomerang, already thinking at the public (who doesn't read Comic Books) to know who they are and also thinking on the sequel plot. I do believe a Comic book movie with great characters cannot just have, the spotlight locked on two or three characters, because the actors are incredibly famous. Must be equally balanced (time on the screen), a great example about this, is Fury. The movie has perfect timing, and show us how to introduce the characters without wasting a single second."
" I only watched this...
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,2,"... because Joel Kinnaman is on it. He's superb, as usual. The rest is awful."
" Roller Coaster!
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,8,"This was great! Don't listen to the stupid nerdy comic book fanatics who wouldn't know how to read a real novel if their lives depended on it. This movie had dark and light, fun and drama, laughs and tears, suspense and comic relief. I loved every moment of it. If you love movies, adventures, action, and fantasy, enjoy it. If you are a diehard never got out of your mom's basement comic book fanatic, let go of your ego and you'll enjoy it too. The people who won't find this review helpful will be the ones who couldn't let go of their basement fostered egos."
" Ok movie
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,7,"Good movie. Not enough sunlight or scenery to compete with Marvel or to be given the credit that it's due. Character development could use a bit more elaboration or creativity, but it was a good movie."
" Simply Awful
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,1,"This is just a poor film.
There is a lot of talk about one or two performances being exceptional but really there was no good performance in this film, the plot is very shallow, the characters are poorly defined and have strange traits that are very hammy like the way they move or walk, it's almost comedic - Killer Croc going down the stairs into water is just missing comedy sound effects.The joker is exceptionally frustrating to watch, even if you leave behind the source material and take it on face value, the performance is terrible.
Harley Quinn has also received a lot of praise but the reality is it is not a good performance and the writing is terrible, some of the lines she says are cringe worthy they are so bad and she takes a strange swing from murderous sociopath to all of a sudden being a ""good guy"" and all about helping everyone.
Will Smith is miscast.I regret watching this film in its entirety as I feel worse off for it."
" What a mess.
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,3,"I mean... What happened? The movie had a few good moments, but overall the story was poorly crafted."
" Not a great superhero movie, but also not a bad one
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,7,"Note: This review is for the extended version, not the theatrical version.This movie probably would have been more enjoyable as a high-budget TV series. The biggest issue with this film is that it feels rushed, even in the extended version. The team members go from ""every man for himself"" to ""I'm willing to give up everything for my teammates"" far too quickly to be believable. I feel like they were quite successful in giving most of the characters ample time for background development, but they simply did not have enough time to convincingly unify the members into a team that is willing to work together.On overall aspects, I felt the intro words for each character were too fast with too many words on screen. Some jokes were good, while others fell flat. I didn't have an issue with the music as other reviewers seem to have.I'd like to go through the main characters next:Deadshot - Easily the best thing about this movie, and I can see why they are considering a solo film for him. In a team of crazies, it's good to have a relatable character to ground the film.Killer Croc - Although I wish they had used CGI to make him closer to his true size, the character was done very well for what he is.Harley Quinn - Also done well, although I never saw anything quite crazy enough or relatable enough to make her a primary character. And a couple of the jokes they gave her were quite bad.The Joker - This is every comic fan's biggest complaint, so I'll start with something positive. Jared Leto actually performed the part well with what little he was given. His scenes and dialogue had little going on, but he managed to draw it out to keep it interesting. It's obvious that this film wanted a different direction for The Joker than previously shown on screen, and it appears this movie aimed for ""disturbing"" to be the primary description. In that, they were very successful. I almost wanted to look away every time he was on screen. Even his distinctive laugh was changed for this film, and the result was quite unsettling. I believe many viewers might have misinterpreted their dislike for the character as Leto's poor acting, but that is simply not the case; the audience was not intended to like him. While Leto can be forgiven, other fundamental changes to the iconic villain are unacceptable. The Joker is presented as a typical gangster. Aside from dressing strangely and forcing his minions to do the same, there is never anything really bizarre or terrifying enough to make him a convincing Joker. But the worst part was his interactions with Harley. Harley's love for The Joker is supposed to not be reciprocated. This is actually shown well in several scenes, but then counteracted by The Joker wanting to help her escape. They should have given The Joker some selfish motive for saving her rather than his implied love for her.Diablo, Rick Flagg, and Katana - As minor characters, they are still given fairly relatable backgrounds, although Katana less so than the other two.Captain Boomerang - He was given very little background and zero emotional scenes. I honestly felt that he didn't belong in the movie aside from one or two scenes that made me laugh. When he was given a chance at freedom, I see no reason at all why he decides to stick with the team.The Witch and the villain - These characters are very unrelatable, but I can forgive that since they are attempting to make so many other characters relatable to the audience."
" Fun and enjoyable
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,8,The movie was fun and enjoyable the only negative was the final fight scene. Everything else was great.PS. Loved the acting as well
" AMAZING!!!!!
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,10,Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was so hot and beautiful!!!! Jared Leto as The Joker was incredible and fantastic!!!!
" The trailer was more fun than the movie
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,5,"Suicide Squad is fun. Unfortunately, it's not as fun as the trailer made it out to be. This movie succeeds when it comes to creating the stylized look and feel of a comic book, but the frantic pacing and the flimsy plot fall a bit short on the screen. Nevertheless, Margot Robbie does a great job as Harley Quinn and Will Smith is effective as Deadshot. Leto's Joker, though, feels like a missed opportunity. I was entertained by this film - it's just not the game changer I hoped it would be."
" Longest music video i've ever seen
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,6,"Suicide Squad seems like a string of music videos featuring various villains of DC comics.
The film is entertaining despite its many flaws, most of the main characters are great, it can be quite funny at times, and has some great cameos. The movie also has a terrible villain ( and a great secondary villain that should've been the main villain), and this movie is horribly edited. Overall the Suicide Squad is entertaining but messy, I just barely liked, but I can see why someone wouldn't."
" Bad
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,3,"Always be remembered as the movie who had the worst Joker and villan army. Waisted so many potential good story from each character and hey your CGI make me thing this one is video game release, to bad is not."
" I've seen worse
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,2,"By ""I've seen worse"" I mean that I've watched movies produced for $100 and even some of those are actually better than this dumpster fire.
Keeping it brief: just say no."
" Don't watch it
",2018-12-21 00:00:00,5,"Hmm...where do I start? So many complaint I want to write down about SS.First of all, many of my friends already warned me how horrible Suicide Squad was. Despite all the warning I still give it a try and watch it on Netflix, wondering why so many people criticize it. After all it is interesting to see a bunch of villain trying to save the world. It can't be that bad right? but I was wrong. It is that BAD. Now I know why. I wonder why this movie even able to get 6 score, I believe it is supposed to be lower than 6. I will try to write it brief, here we go.The only thing I like from this crap is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Will Smith as Deadshot. The rest can go down to the trash bin for all I care.What's so bad about this movie?
1.) I tell you, there's no plot. The only looks like plot here was Amanda Waller and the team trying to defeat the witch to save the world (which, the main problem itself caused by Amanda Waller. It was her idea in the first place trying to control a bunch of villains and take advantage of them. She literally threatened them and so the witch tried to free herself from her)2.) Amanda Waller. I really hate her throughout the movie and really happy when the villain got her. She deserved it. She was cold hearted, cruel (masking it with twisted sense of justice), and her mouth was nasty. She even killed her own subordinates and in the late movies, only care about her safety. C'mon guys, She was really awful. I really hate every scenes when she was in.3.) Jared Leto as Joker. To be honest, one of my main reason to see SS was because I saw Joker in the trailer. YET, I am so disappointed. He really didn't have any importance in this movie only served as Harley past. He only appeared randomly several times. Really, cut all of his scene and it won't really matter for the rest of the story. He was weird, not convincing enough, and totally failed to play Joker, a supposed to be insane, genius, twisted criminal. Totally the opposite of Heath Ledger (he was brilliant!)4.) Trying to be like Avengers or Guardian of the Galaxy and failed to be both. To many characters in this movie and they did weak story telling about each character or on how they were connected. So, you will find yourself hard to sympathize or connected with any of them. The character's development was poor so you can't really like them.5.) Didn't make sense. Amanda got the heart of the witch to threaten her, in order to freely control her. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HER WEAKNESS because she will die if something happen to her heart. The witch then, trying to go against Amanda so Amanda stab her heart so MANY TIMES to get rid of her. YET, the witch survived. It looks like what Amanda did, didn't affect the witch so much. So stupid. If it doesn't matter at all, why the hell the witch was so afraid about Amanda taking her heart in the first place. She didn't die after those multiple stab on her heart. Stupid. Really.If you want to watch some anti-hero, just go watch Deadpool. It is a good one."
" Really enjoyable comic book movie
",2018-12-19 00:00:00,6,"Suicide Squad is a really enjoyable comic book movie but its not without it's problems. It's got a generic plot and a weak villain, who is extremely forgettable. Jared Leto doesn't get enough screen time. A couple of the Suicide Squad members are also forgettable and have little depth. But it also has a lot of action sequences that are well filmed and really enjoyable as well great direction from David Ayer. Its really funny throughout. Margot Robbie is a perfect Harley Quinn and Will Smith, Joel Kinnaman, Jay Hernandez and Jai Courtney all give great performances. The soundtrack is amazing and the music by Steven Price is really good. The CG is good."
" Schlechter als erwatet
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,2,Es war nicht das erwartet Popcorn kino. Wir hätten uns mehr erwartetet
" AWESOME
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,10,"Not necessarily for children under the age of 13, but is a movie that can be watched over and over, I never get tired of it. Jared Leto is the best Joker yet in my opinion and he killed the role! he is even better than the late Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight."
" Visually Unforgettable With A Big Heart
",2018-12-12 00:00:00,10,"For better or worse, Suicide Squad is best watched as a sort of visual exhibition made by comic book-inspired artists. Much of what comic books such an intriguing and compelling form of narrative is their subtle and creative use of visuals to create theme, atmosphere and character, yet so many modern comic book films get hung up on telling us these details purely through words. For whatever else you can accuse Suicide Squad of, it gets this. From a purely aesthetic standpoint, this is perhaps the most interesting comic book film I've seen since Persepolis.The plot is nothing special, admittedly full of holes and often contrived, but I was ultimately able to dismiss this based on 1) The underwhelming stories of most franchise-set comic book films 2) The inventive ways Suicide Squad handles its visuals and characters and 3) The acting performances. Director David Ayer looks at how diverse his characters are in background, personality and abilities and uses this to blend all sorts of visual styles to pull us into this grandiose, trippy, but ultimately toxic and frightening, nightmare world that these colorful villains experience every day. Deadshot brings a more slick and clean early 2000s spy thriller aesthetic to his scenes, Enchantress heavy sequences feel reminiscent of a Renaissance artist, Diablo's moments are reflective of Aztec codex paintings. Even the much maligned Joker & Harley Quinn bring an art style straight out of West Coast tattoo culture. What Ayer does in allowing all these major players in his ensemble cast to bring their own unique artistic fashion to the film is, as far as I know, unprecedented in this genre. Furthermore, all of these visual styles are implemented beautifully. What Suicide Squad has that so many comic book films of today lack is atmosphere and personality. Suicide Squad has that in spades. Harley Quinn's birth at Ace Chemicals remains to this day the most visually striking and aesthetically gorgeous scene I've witnessed in a comic book film, feeling straight off the page of one of the best DC Comics artists. The visuals go far in making this film feel like a ""comic book brought to life"" and each of these styles does a wonderful job visually telling us more about these characters.On that note, thank God we finally have a superhero team up movie where the screenwriter didn't feel compelled to have all of the characters hate each other for the dumbest reasons imaginable for the entire film up until the last 10 minutes. The Squad members here have genuine chemistry in a kind of ""honor among thieves"" sort of way, their experience out in the Hellish streets for which they've earned their notoriety has taught them the necessity of ""bond to survive."" (Also, as much as people want to harp on Harley Quinn becoming instant friends with Deadshot, this is hardly out of character. In Batman: The Animated Series, she makes instant buddies with her kidnapping victim. Being unexpectedly friendly to strangers who pose no threat to her, despite her chaotic and violent nature, has always been part of her charm.) It's an excellent subversion of expectations regarding how common audience members may expect these characters to react. Furthermore, it brings more weight and substance to Rick Flagg's character arc; how he begins the film with a very black & white view of morality, but begins to recognize the gray areas upon witnessing both the Squad's camaraderie and their eventual heroism and capacity for good.Margot Robbie's acting performance as Harley Quinn is my favorite I've seen in any superhero film to date. She entirely feels like her antiheroine counterpart jumped straight off the pages of her literary source material. Her balance of sickly, sweet friendliness and unpredictable, manic insanity is perfection and she shows incredible emotional range here in both her facial acting and vocal delivery in an unbelievably transformative role for Robbie. Her scene at the bar scolding Diablo comes from such a place of emotional passion and energy, Robbie IS the Clown Queen of Crime as far as I'm concerned.Viola Davis is an absolute force as Amanda Waller. She commands such power and such presence in every scene she's in that I had no problem believing this is the kind of person that could put A-list metas in line with nothing more than a hardened stare. As with Robbie's Harley Quinn, I can't think of a better and more commanding actress for the role.While Jared Leto's Joker certainly didn't set the world on fire, I really enjoyed him. Leto works quite well as a more seductive take on The Joker, a Joker more representative of the appeal to the dark side of life that Harley finds so intoxicating. Even the romanticization of their relationship isn't nearly as awful as it's made out to be when you consider that almost all of Harley & Joker's interactions are told from the perspective of bias; Harley's skewed memories. It makes sense she would remember the good more than the bad.Many critics have called the film thematically shallow and I would strongly disagree with this assertion. The themes of unconditional love and sacrifice are quite strong here in the journeys of Deadshot, Harley, Diablo and Flagg. These are characters who very much start the film quite self absorbed, but who must learn the value of sacrifice through the bonds they form amongst each other. To, if only for one day, become the heroes they could have been in a fairer world. To become worthy of both the love of others and the love of self. As much of a mess as the plot is, it's an emotionally resonant and thought provoking message that's well conveyed with its main cast.The insane critical backlash for this film, while not depressing, is certainly frustrating. The performances are great, the characters are likable and have great chemistry and the visuals, and their usage, are unforgettable. This is comic book euphoria."
" Wrong choice of villain but a good live-action adaption
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,7,"This is my third time watching this movie, second with the extended cut and I like it but the story and villain are lacking, Enchantress is cool and all but for a Suicide Squad movie it doesn't work, should have been for a Justice League Dark movie.
The characters are well cast, great and well introduced. Margot Robbie, Will Smith, Viola Davis and Joel Kinnaman is pure perfection. The tattoos is the only bad thing about Harley Quinn. Jared Leto could have been great as the Joker but the look of him and such isn't the Joker for me. The small screen time Ben Affleck had was wonderful and some serious throwback to the Animated Series with the gadgets and such.The soundtrack, comedy, costumes, props and makeup are top notch. David Ayer is a great director but again, he would have been great to write a more crime like story for Suicide Squad like they did for the animated movie which had a perfect villain. It was a good movie but the animated movie is a lot better, the upcoming sequel should be R Rated like the animated movie. Why not take Desthstroke or Injustice League as the villain for the second movie."
" Suicide squad : Hit and miss
",2018-12-08 00:00:00,5,"Suicide squad (2016) was the third installment for the DC extended cinematic universe connecting with Batman V Superman : Dawn of Justice (2016), would have been an amazing cinematic experience seeing it's cast, budget and crew but sadly it's a hit and miss. And also story wise.The story is flat and unemotional. The DC extended universe did the same mistake with Man of steel (2013).There is soo much explosions and gun fights but no real experience. Only thing that keeps the film running is Will Smith's Deadshot performance.And after Heath Ledgers master of a performance as Joker in The Dark Knight (2008), Jared Leto was expected to with a higher benchmark.Since he is extremely talented and the teasers showed a different joker, expectations of the fans were extrelmely high.Sadly we have 10 minutes of an idiot of a performance, he is more of a gangster than a mastermind criminal sociopath we see in the Joker character arc in the comics, cartoons and past films.Harley Quinn by Margot Robbie was highly anticipated but also less performed. She's too funny and less action.David Ayer is a good director. Harsh times (2005), Street Kings (2008) and End of Watch (2012) are really good films.Sabotage(2014) and Fury(2014) are made in the Suicide squad formula reflecting on a set of different character arcs working together to a common goal, which makes the viewers expectation for Suicide Squad extremely high.But sadly like ""Sabotage(2014)"" this fails spectacularly.The connectivity to the DC Extended universe is the other only thing that kept the film alive.Overall - 2.5/5"
" Robbed of my time
",2018-12-08 00:00:00,1,"Poor writing, poor directing, and poor producing. I felt like I was back in the 90's, with every fight scene miraged by darkness and sudden flashes. The fight scenes are so zoomed into the action so you can't even see what's really going on. I can't imagine the hunchos with DC comics being pleased with spending and arm and a leg for such a dissapointment. The ONLY good thing about the movie was the acting from Will Smith and the actress who plays Harley Quinn. Everything else was just hard to watch."
" 9 for style, 1 for substance, so 5
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,5,"After the death of Superman and the realisation that the next 'meta human' could be malevolent, hard-case bureaucrat Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembles a crew of differentially-powered villains who, under the threat of having their heads exploded, agree to team up and defend 'truth, justice and the American way', and just in time, as Earth is facing yet another God-like existential threat. The whole premise of the film is ridiculous: in case a virtually indestructible, flying, superhuman threat appears, Waller assembles a team that includes a crack shot, a guy that throws bladed boomerangs, a person with good rope skills, a swordswomen, and an acrobatic women whose weapon of choice is a baseball bat. These mere mortals are then immediately drawn into a battle with some kind of demigod who can demolish armoured vehicles with a wave of his hand, his heavily armed and nearly indestructible minions, and his sister who can dematerialise at will. Unfortunately, this one-sided battle is resolved by having all of the villains' hench-things decide to have a punch-up with the heroes rather than simply shoot them, the appearance of a Satanus-ex-machina, and the hitherto indestructible villain becoming inexplicably, but conveniently, fragile. Leading up to this unsatisfying climax is endless style-drenched slow motion shots of the Squad, limp bromances, strained quips, and the contrived backstories of the anti-heroic ensemble, most of which are not that interesting. The cast is generally good (considering the material) but even Margot Robbie, whose Harley Quinn character is easily the most interesting part of the movie, starts to get tiresome. Will Smith's Deadshot is pretty much the same as every other Will Smith character, so the world's most deadly assassin becomes an unmenacing wise-guy whose principal concern is being a loving dad. Jared Leto is initially good as the Joker, but then goes so 'over the top' that the character becomes more silly than threatening. Despite the imagination that went into the details, 'Suicide Squad' ends up looking like every other big-budget CGI hero-fest. The film is watchable for what it is, but in the end, it is not very memorable, considering the time and money that went into its production (which is my general conclusion for most of the Marvel/DC genre these days)."
" 5
",2018-12-04 00:00:00,5,"I would say very average movie. Nothing special. I was really expecting more. It's just messy killing stupid action film. From the title of the movie and from the popularity it had I was willing something like Avengers but it's meh,basic... too basic for me."
" Suicide Squad? Wait none of them did that...
",2018-12-04 00:00:00,1,"So hearing good and bad perspectives about this movie I finally decided to watch it, my hesitation finally leaving me. While there was great potential initially for this to be a first of its kind for villains saving the day, it just wasn't great or good overall. Not sure why Warner Bros still hasn't hit the DC Universe successfully like Marvel has- no one really stirring the ship I suppose. Characters were lacking and script seems campy at times. I see why Deadshot got more screen time- top paid actor, at least he is good at math like his daughter. Math is everything. That's how you cap a fool yo! Joker was just bad, his laugh was the only Joker-esk quality about him and it was overkill. Jared Leto is a creep in real life, maybe he should have played himself more. Harley Quinn's accent sounded bad, so so many quips, we get it you're cray cray girl- drink that espresso! Enchantress had an awesome transformation from Dr. June into the ""witch"" at first in the meeting with the token military advisers, yet after that the CGI was just too bad of quality and too much especially at the end fight seen. Also her voice didn't sync well, it reminded me of the Gatekeeper in the Ghostbusters scenes, just kind of funny. Didn't some director come in last minute to heighten color on some of the scenes? That trick or ""name drop"" (search and you will find him) didn't work. Katana just shows up to help, the references about her husband's trapped soul in her katana is talked about way too much, once was a enough, twice was just bad writing, we get it she has emotional stuff to work out. Oh wait they all do. El Diablo almost seemed like a stereotypically racist character- I'm still not sure how I feel about that, what is this a Michael Bay racist Transformer idea? Why though... And Killer Croc should have gotten more kills, his overall design was too humanoid not enough Croc in my opinion. Slipknot was expendable like some of Deadpool's X-Force Team, hold on, weren't the Suicide Squad refered too as Force X by Amanda Waller? Mind explode, POW! Overall this movie just wasn't as great as it could have been. It was too AA meeting for me, oh duh that happened, although the villains didn't hold hands and say a prayer after they had a drink, at least they had a drink. Oh yeah, my thought came back like Captain Boomerangs lame boomerang he threw near the end of the movie to spy on the Enchantress with his Samsung phone. Good placement add, can't wait to buy a Samsung phone, but wouldn't that cloud of electric magic-ultimate-weapon Enchantress was channeling cancel any satellite reception? Nevermind, they killed the satellite later. Oh that makes sense as well as the three ring binder of top secret info on villains, hero's or the whole story plot, because Batman isn't good with computers at all. Either is a top secret government that's why they kill their IT people, dang crappy universe to live in. At least unicorn stuff animals are in and beers that appear out of no where, that's right Captain Boomerrang, what else you got in that jacket you magician you."

" Two words. Harley Quinn!
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,5,"I gave this film a rating of 6 because Margot Robbie has 6 letters in her first and last names. The reason behind this is because she is the ONLY reason to watch this film! Plain and simple, Harley Quinn steals EVERY scene in this film! Forget about Jared Leto's Joker, he pales in comparison to Ledger's Dark Knight Crown Prince of Crime! This film is ALL Margot! From her hair to her HOT shorts to absolute Joker smile. This film is 100% Harley Quinn!"
" not like in the trailer
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,4,"The movie trailer had become very popular and my expectation was obviously very high and the movies I wanted to watch were among the most wanted,
but I've had frustration after watching the movie.I'm a huge joker fan and I like joker character at the cinema but I didn't like the joker in this movie.I like Jared Leto his a good actor but he could not play the joker character well I hope they do not continue with it.
it wasn't a nice movie , it's never been a movie about the superheroes' enemies gathering and fighting another evil.So this movie was very curious.I didn't like the scenes of the film, some scenes didn't like what I could say very ridiculous."
" DISAPPOINTMENT
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,5,"This is one of the worse superhero movies in 21st century. Movie cant decide its mood. It tries to be funny, sometimes serious and even sometimes dramatic. But it is nothing. A story like that goes slow everytime, cant believe this. Even in action scenes. But basicly, this project had a big potential. It is a great comic book event, has a awesome fiction, a diffrent Joker after Heath, a great Harley Quinn, big stars like Will Smith, colourful and diffrent characters... Movie's villian is worst part of it for me. My favourites about this film are musics, Batman's scenes and final scene. Because there are Batman and Joker, you know. Im sorry for you Leto; you are great, just not lucky."
" a great concept destroyed
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,2,Review: I was really disappointed with this movie because I expected a lot more from a supervillain concept. The direction was sub-par. The screenplay was disappointing especially by the lack of Joker and Harley Quinn but huge amounts of every other villain. The casting and acting were both sub par but Margot Robbie stands above everyone else as Harley Quinn. All in all I would give this two out of a possible five stars.
" I'm sorry but...
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,2,"This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Awful script full of bad dialogue and plot holes. Awful acting. The VO for Enchantress was laughable. No plot whatsoever. Most of the cast are good-great actors, just not in this film."
" SUICIDE SQUAD
",2018-11-12 00:00:00,10,"Come on People #1-give me a BREAK it was a AWESOME FILM. It was just VERY DIFFERERENT THEN THE OTHER FILM'S.
Just look at IT that way. Yes the Joker was really WEARD and STRANG NO OSCAR WINNER BUT JUST DIFFERT. But the WHOLE FILM WAS CRAZY. LOOK AT IT THAT WAY."

" All over the place in terms of...Everything
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,4,"This movie was upsetting and frustrating in so many ways, the most being that every once in a while it shows signs that it could have been a good movie. if only...somebody didn't...just screw it up so bad. SO BADAnd you already know it's bad. When suicide squad came out the internet was flooded with detailed critiques of its writing, editing, pacing, tone, how often they prefer to tell instead of show, racist and sexist portrayals of characters etc. Margot Robbie is a good actress. Have you seen I, Tonya? She was GREAT but Meryl Streep couldn't even pull a good Harley out of this script.Will Smith and Viola Davis, however were allowed to shine which is weird 'cause I just mentioned how this movie was racist and sexist AF. There are moments with them that are so good it's INFURIATING because it makes you wonder where the heck they came from and why the whole movie isn't like this. Shoot why isn't the whole DC Universe like this? You have Amanda Waller out here KILLIN IT meanwhile you have Killer Croc and how all his lines seem to have been added in post the way they don't really fit and the way he's always the only character on screen when he talks. And the scene where they first introduce Enchantress was super creepy and cool but by the end she just makes out with people to turn them into power rangers putties and does that...wiggle thing. there are so many inconsistencies in every aspect of this movie. I'm so frustrated.I'm really trying not to go off and go over EVERYTHING and it's hard. There's just so much that was wrong and so many little tweaks that could have fixed it.And like, Beware the Batman (RIP gone too soon) made me fall in love with Katana as a character and they just. ""That's KATANA her SWORD takes the SOULS of its victims so you better WATCH OUT"""
" Not my cup of tea
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,3,"I sometimes feel a little disenfranchised as I'm not a liver if superhero type films, but I'll always compromise and see them. Perhaps I'm just unlucky, I was made to sit through Batman Vs Superman, and then this, I felt as if I were being punished. Two hours of wall to wall nonsense, there was virtually no plot of any kind, or what there was went over my head. I can't say the acting was bad, Will Smith I really liked, and despite not particularly being a huge fan, I'd say one of Cara Delevingne's better performances.Some great special effects, perhaps a film if have enjoyed if I was twelve. At this very time I'd have to say I thought it was very poor. 3/10"
" New low for big budget garbage

Pure garbage. Inept at every stage, relying on explosions and noise to cover up the creative vacuum. Doesn't work you morons, especially on the small screen. Wish I could rate it zero for the most incompetent use of Black Sabbath in a music score ever. I don't know anyone I hate enough to make them watch this. Want to really appreciate the crap here?

The critics gave it a measly 25%, and the audience (the better half -- that is, in terms of the thumbs up given), gave it a 'whopping' 65%. By the way, Is it just me or do those numbers not add up to a 100...Anyway, I decided to watch it, now in 2018, and I liked it. That says a lot coming from a big Marvel fan who's had the joy of seeing some really amazing releases this year. So this review is quite a fair one.DC Universe; that's where the untold glory of this movie lies.Suicide Squad had a lot to accomplish and not enough time to do it. They were really ambitious, but fell a bit short on the execution. On one hand they're trying to introduce more than a dozen main characters to the world, the suicide squad. And on the other hand they're trying to work up a plot that engages every single one of these badasses in a 2 hour film. You can only do so much with 2 hours, more than a dozen main characters with character development, and a plot twisted into all of that.As a result, they delivered something that felt like an introductory episode. Something that's still to unravel. The light isn't yet focused into one direction but rather tries to shine up the whole street. Which is sort of beautiful in itself.However though, that's also where the bad points come marching in.This isn't some movie with some amazing plot and a twist so fresh you feel screwed at the end it of it all, no. But it's well done, and it's DC.If you've watched about a hundred episodes of Batman and the likes, which you've undoubtedly have (everybody watches those things), then you'll probably appreciate this movie. I guess that's where the 65% came from. You get to see all of those villains you once loved (Killer Croc, anybody?) come together and blow some heads off (or eat them), in a way you'd expect from DC, and the guys who killed Batman....No, I'm just kidding, Batman lives. You can relax.Suicide Squad brings some character development. What it lacks in plot it makes up for in character development (in its own special way). Giving you a chance to love those characters just a little bit more.There's also no doubt that Suicide Squad 2 will probably be more developed. It's promised in this installment. I'm looking forward to something more focused. A fresh crazy new story that comes after we've sat at the table with the bad guys."

What it lacks in detail and plot it makes up for in character development (in its own special way).

" waste of time
",2018-10-23 00:00:00,3,"What a clattery train-wreck of a movie, and incredible waste of talent. With all the CGI, awful writing, dim joke, might as well have been watching a video game. I REALLY wanted to like it, but we just weren't made for each other."
" An absolute laughing stock.
",2018-10-22 00:00:00,1,"Suicide Squad is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen. It is one of the worst ANYTHINGS I have ever seen. The acting is atrocious, apart from Will Smith playing Deadshot. Margot Robbie and Jared Leto both stick out to me with how bad they are. These have to be the worst incarnations of The Joker and Harley Quinn ever put to screen. Margot is just straight up annoying and is only in there for sex appeal, and Jared's acting is absolutely horrible. Every other actor leans on bad or average. The characters are all idiots and are completely one dimensional. The storyline is so unbearably stupid and is riddled with plot holes and the overall editing and effects are god awful. The fight scenes in The Amazing Spider-Man look better than any of the scenes in this movie. This movie was only made for fan-service. They did not give two craps about the quality of this absolute disaster. And somehow, against all the odds, this movie got an Oscar......HOW??? If that doesn't prove how meaningless Oscars are, then I don't know what will. Screw this movie."
" Overhyped mess
",2018-10-19 00:00:00,4,This movie had incredible characters but went nowhere. The plot was a mess and seemed scrambled together. I quickly lost interest as the characters personalities became the only interesting thing. Really good soundtrack though.
" Not what you think
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,3,"Like most reviews on here I agree that the plot was muddled and too much screen time was given to dead shot and Harley Quinn.
There is almost no back stories for the characters and almost no screen time for the Joker.
 After the initial bad reviews I waited until the film came out on Netflix. 
On the positive side the actors are great fits for their characters, the effects are very nicely done, and Viola Davis and Margot Robbie stand out from the rest. 
I'm on the fence with Jared Leto's Joker interpretation though. This may be because there was not enough screen time for him to expand because at this point it seems ridiculous."
" Harley Quinn is literally the only wonderful thing about this
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,1,"The DCEU is getting NOWHERE!!!!!! MCU even if it has Disney material has had it all for over ten years! This movie is utter garbage in nearly every way. Harley Quinn is the only good spotlight in this, but everything else...NOPE! The coolest trailer for this movie told me this was gonna be a dark and gritty movie about the squad going up against the Joker, who is a just a joke in this movie... But no... We got trash.... Idek if I will see Suicide Squad 2.... I have very little faith in DCEU. Only really good movie is WW and hopefully it's sequel."
" A big pile of disappointment..
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,4,"Rewatched this mess again a couple of days ago and came here to check what grade i gave to it a couple of years ago when i saw it.. and i was surprised to see that i gave it 7 stars.. and i thought.. why?
After seeing it again (why? Indeed) it reminds me how bad a superhero movie can get. Yes, there are far more worse superhero from this one.. but after the huge hype from the amazing trailers they gaveus you kind of feel the disappointment of how truly great this movie could have been.
The movie started promising with the introduction of the characters with the use of great visuals but then it dragged to almost half an hour of exposition and it felt so rushed that they were introducing the one character next to another with scenes that didn't really matched together and it seemed that they were doing it just to get it over with and move to the ""juice"" of the movie..
Now for the plot of the movie. I don't think there's anyone out there who haven't seen this but I won't spoil it anyway.. the plot is a big nothing.. just gather a bunch of bad guys and go from one place to another until they meet the bigger and badder villain.. aand that's it.. unclear and predictable things happen in between those scenes but as a whole it's a big pile of nothing..
Also, the use of music in this movie is the worst use of music i've seen in quite some time. It made the movie feel like a mashup of video clips made for the tv.. you can clearly see and hear in some scenes that they've changed the score in the reshoots so they can lighten up the mood and don't let it get dark (BvS)
The only members from the squad i seem to care was only Harley and Deadshot. They had a handful of good scenes (the birth of Harley Quinn and the tragic backstory of deadshot) not that they were that great in characterization but in comparison with the rest of the characters they had something more. Also i hate to say this but i hated the joker in this.. making the joker like a gangster it just not have that result i was expecting. It surely seems that Jared Leto is doing his best and he is really having a great time but the role of joker in this is really unnecessary.
Overall the movie has a few funny and great scenes here and there and the acting isn't bad and if you really don't care about the plot of the movie you'll probably have a great time. It just makes me so sad of how exceptional this movie could have been if it wasn't for the plot, music and characters."
" Not that fun or enjoyable to watch.
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,3,"With a weak, cobbled together story and a slow, by the numbers start, this film just isn't that fun or enjoyable to watch, although there are some good moments and ideas. The two main Squad members (Deadshot & Harley Quinn) are great to watch thanks to the strong characterisation and acting, but the rest of the characters feel underdeveloped and in some cases, completely unnecessary. There is good use of popular music in some of the scenes, but this becomes tiresome by the end of the film. The special effects are good, but many of the action scenes are too dark and this obscures the action."

",2018-10-05 00:00:00,3,"(heavy snoring)
This film is bland, cliched, poorly lit and dull. Admittedly the characters are well cast, with Margot Robbie's charismatic performance as a standout, but overall, Suicide Squad is dreary, inane and sleep inducingly boring."
" Cringe-worthy
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,6,"This film was average. I gave it 6 out of respect for the high budget thrown at costumes, cinematography, set design, editing, etc etc. The acting was over the top - it could have been better. It was watchable on the plane but probably won't see it again."
" 5 go mad in Dorset has more bite than this

" Not DC
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,2,Charcters just don't seem true to the original DC comics at all. This film could have been a lot better. P.s Jared Leto's Joker is awful.
" Pretentious Portrayals of The Original Characters from the Comic Books
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,1,"Only Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger can pull off The Joker facade, but not Jared Leto. Not now currently. What makes me hopeful is that I have looked harder and found better films that are recent in comparison to this film that is easily downloadable from its notorious popularity from being part of the now desperate Warner Bros. company."
" Truly not good at all.
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,4,Great cast and a big budget couldn't save this from being an inevitable flop by critics. There was just no substance to the story. Cringe-worthy moments. Basically you watch a whole bunch of villain misfits walking down the street having moments with each other while on their little silly quest that brought them somehow together. Nice try DC.
" Very sloppy
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,1,What hurt really. . . Really badly was the story line and bad acting. Harley Quinn kept dropping her accent most of the movie. But I think that has to do with editing on the takes she did. In my humble opinion I think Jared Leto is a great actor but NOT for the joker. I didn't like the whole tattoo and grills thing. But at least he gave it his best shot. Movie was just all over the place.
" Good grief
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,1,Lots of films have flopped that have had huge budgets and that won't change. In time some can gain a cult status or be considered to have been misunderstood at time of release etc. This film will never amount to more than utter dross. I liked some of the music
" good for killing time
",2018-09-27 00:00:00,7,"Was it awful? No. Was it marvelous? No. If you have some time to spend at home and can't find anything to do and want to laugh a little bit, it is good to watch this movie BUT I warn you not to have high expectations. Don't forget that you are just watching this movie because you don't want to say ""I haven't seen it"" and you want something a little funny. You don't need to think about it while watching, just catch the moment and you will understand everything very clearly. I quite like the soundtracks, they got stuck in my head for a while. Last of all, I recommend watching it without any expectation."
" Loved it.
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,8,"Watched Suicide Squad with my girlfriend and really enjoyed it, when we returned home to world was on fire and we did not know why. Social media, news outlets, chatter on the streets said Suicide Squad was the worst movie since movies. I asked my girlfriend why all the hate, and she is really smart said ""they only know how to hate, that is our culture."" Also I believe most of the reviews are from child like minds, most of the keyboards that are being pressed upon are purchased by mommy and daddy, they even think the electricity is free."
" An Unwatchable movie
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,2,"This movie is unwatchable. The plot is completely senseless, the action is more boring than the 2005 Fantastic Four movie, misleading trailer, terrible final act (the entire movie is already bad), a waste of Will Smith (he is too good for this movie), non-stop usage of popular songs, and probably the worst version of the Joker ever seen.The story is about this lady who wants to create a special team to fight off bad guys, so she assembles some bad criminals and send them into this deserted city to fight a bunch of nameless creatures and save the city, while she secretly has something up her sleeves. The first thing wrong with this is that half of the ""Suicide Squad"" are completely useless and shouldn't even have been a choice to fight this ancient evil. Harley Quinn, Boomerang, & Slipknot are completely useless and have no special abilities at all (Slipknot does nothing in this movie). Harley fights with a bat, and Boomerang throws boomerangs. They could have used special soldiers instead. Harley poses no threat at all, Boomerang is big but useless, and Slipknot may have a special ability but he does nothing at all because he is just in this movie to show the audience ""Hey, this is what happens when you don't obey orders."" Seriously, the actor playing Slipknot should be angry that he was dressed up, all hyped only to do absolutely nothing in this movie.The action is bad. There is not a single action scene that even gets you excited or whatever. Batman V Superman had way better action. In that movie we got some cool Batman car battle scenes, Batman and Superman fighting, Batman fighting thugs in a warehouse, and the final battle. The best action scene in this movie is the scene where the Suicide Squad is ambushed and Will Smith climbs on a car and shoots them. It is cool but still completely pales when compared to BvS. The final battle is also very bad, with the Suicide Squad suddenly out of nowhere telling each other that they are family and that they will defeat this evil, without ever giving us a sense that they even know each other. There is zero development in this movie. They spend a lot of time just walking down an empty street, talking without any context. For no reason at all, they go into a bar and start drinking, then Harley suddenly becomes sentimental and berates one of the Suicide Squad for doing something bad, while she and everyone else does bad stuff too. Lastly, nothing against Jared Leto. He has two songs I like. His performance in this movie is a complete fail. He is just channeling Health Ledger, even though he said he won't. He licks his lips when talking just like Ledger, he talks just like Ledger, and he make these head movements just like Ledger. He is a Mexican gangster in this movie, with gangster tattoos, and he has no point in this movie. He has one really cool scene with him and Harley Quinn bleaching their skins, but besides that, this is the worst Joker of all time. His scenes are just flashbacks that happens during certain points in the movie when Harley Quinn begins to think about him, that is all. David Ayer is a great director, but for some reason this movie just completely fails. This is one of those movies that I would put on my ""Unwatchable List."" So far the list contains such movies as Transformers 2,and Moebius (2013)."
" A choppy, sprawling effort
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,5,"SUICIDE SQUAD is a choppy, sprawling effort from the DC Universe from hit-or-miss director David Ayer. The idea is to have all the major villains teaming up to go on their own DIRTY DOZEN-style story in return for a reduction in their jail sentences. Sadly, the end result is choppy and imperfect, mildly entertaining here and there but failing overall. Certain elements, like Jared Leto's Joker, feel extraneous to the main story and have no real reason to be included. And the addition of an embarrassingly awful Cara Delevingne as the villain of the piece - she's no actress and never has been - is the film's nadir. However, it's not all bad. Will Smith is likeable and assured as the lead, given solid support by Joel Kinnaman and Jai Courtney. The film has an absolute ton of action to see it through, so although it's frequently silly, it's never boring, at least. It's a shame it all ends in a generic CGI way, as have pretty much all superhero flicks of the last ten years, but it's not unwatchable."

So when DC started showing the trailers for Suicide Squad i was really happy and started looking forward to the Movie. But than it came out... A lot of my friends went to see it in cinema, but I didnt have time to join them (luckily). A lot of them told me that it was a really good movie and the kept recommending it. So one day I watched it myself and after 30 minutes I already started to regret my decision. They had some cool actors like Will Smith or Margot Robbie but even they couldn´t save this movie.The characters were badly written, the story was completely uninteresting and also poorly written. They put a lot of effort in some characters and gave them a litte backstory-sequence and others didn´t receive nearly as much attention.This one guy, slipknot was only put in this movie so that they had someone to kill, and demonstrate that all the Suicide Squad members were really in danger because of these litte bombs inside their necks, the goverment injected them.So to all of you I can´t recommend this movie however thats just my opinion."

",2018-09-08 00:00:00,8,"This story was a bit of a mess, but the fun characters can't be denied. Harley Quinn was perfect. Deadshot was pretty good, and most of the rest, except for the Joker. As is usual with DC comic movies, they struggle with villains, and overuse computer effects. So the first 3/4 of the movie was pretty good, leading up to a disappointing end that is chaotic and cartoony. Still, I enjoyed this more the second time, but truly it is only for hardcore comic book nerds like myself, but perhaps less picky ones."
" Perfect way to utilize Suicide in the title
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,3,"What do you get when you have a generic action movie with try to be likeable ""bad guys"" mixed with a bad cgi character, Suicide... Oh and Squad. And I almost forgot, heaps of music videos, and anticipation for a movie with a badly convincing joker that needs to have hahaha tattooed on his chest to sell that he is a Joker and an average Harley Quinn. For a movie with a decent set up, it's just went into a cgi show with a generic plot we see in every movie."
" A huge disappointment !
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,3,"I was waiting for this movie and i've been excited about it after seeing the trailer but then while watching it i found out that it was really awful , there is no clear scenario, anyone can expect what's happening next each scene. there are so many main characters in the movie who has barely contributed in the developing of the events. The movie was also really boring and absolutely with no creativity, it's simply a big loss of money. i can't really get out with a positive point from it."
" Wow! New and unimaginable levels of awfulness
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,2,"Seriously. Do something else with your time. Watch paint dry, self lobotomise, extract your own teeth. This is the worst movie ever made and deserves a two because Margo Robbie, and because Will Smith, without them it'd be lucky to get a minus 2. The most ridiculous film ever made.

" Should have been so much better
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,4,"This is an OK action movie, but a poor superhero/comic book movie. Had great potential but didnt live up to it, I like that first half with the introductions etc but once the story gets going it kinda slumps into a stereotypical action movie."
" Is it my horrible taste in movies, or is the movie not that bad?
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,7,"I've been reading the comments about Suicide Squad, and everyone hates it. But the thing is, it's a pretty decent movie for me. Harley Quinn was well portrayed, and she came across as a interesting character. Deadshot was actually caring, and his actions are motivated by his desire to help is daughter. Most of the characters weren't that bad, although the boomerang guy wasn't that important or likable. Anyways, the plot is just the stereotypical action movie plot, but the action and magic is still fun to watch. Although this movie still has numerous flaws, it's fun, and the characters are actually likeable, and the backstories were pretty interesting. Don't expect an 
Oscar-winning masterpiece, and learn to still enjoy a simple action flick."
" A horrible Mess
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,1,"I honestly don't get it. I really don't. Where are all the high ratings coming from? Is it from 12 year old boys who say 'oooooo, look I saw Margot Robbie with her shirt off and saw her bra.'? Maybe trolls who don't care about content but just want 'action, action, action' because it's the only movie they see this year, and 'oh by the way, I saw Margot Robbie with her shirt off. HeHe'? There was hardly any character development, the characters portrayed in this movie didn't really reflect their characters in the comics, The Joker was portrayed as some type of Rapper type gangster (which isn't the character. The Joker isn't a white Rapper wannabe Gangster. He is a seriously disturbed character who has very serious mental health issues who people can say 'in a certain twisted way yeah! I get the logic'). Will Smith plays too much of a 'nice guy' type of character in which his character wasn't really that 'nice of a guy'. On top of that we find Margot Robbie playing Harley Quinn. A Character that is suppose to be unrealisticly 'in love' with the Joker. But all we get is 'oh, how cute! They have a misunderstood love that the public doesn't understand' type of character arch. Really people? How did this movie even make it's money back!?"
" It's good and disappointing at the same time!
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,6,"As a fan of DC, I was disappointed a little. The reason of making the squad was completely sucks. The cast was brilliant, except for Jared Leto. It wasn't that bad, but it's not The Joker we deserve! 
It was really comedy and fun. And the CGI worked very well for me. The action scenes was really good too. So I liked it, but not what I expected!"
" This is SUICIDE SQUAD, not FURY David Aiyer
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,3,"BLUNDER is a one word review! I'd suggest not to look ant further...But if you did then kindly fasten your seatbelts to the ride named ""WHY THE EFF WAS THIS FILM EVEN RELEASED & WHAT IS WB UPTO!""
Film begins well with the calm and pretty quite intro of characters and takes its time for setting the mood. Individuals were introduced quite well and there was just enough to help anyone understand them. Mood set, we're all ready to watch a heel lot of action! Wait, you won't get any!
Some of Batman's worst enemies and DC's most valuable villains come together to chat nonsense and walk on a reconnaissance mission in a city ruined by an ancient sorcerer... this is a recipe inviting disaster right from beginning. At one point one would wonder whether this is a film based on comic book characters or a ""BENEFITS OF WALKING 10 KILOMETERS EVERYDAY"" video. Dialogues were awfully half done for most parts and screenplay was awfully bad. Most of the film doesn't make sense until Amanda Waller is rescued and, even after that will viewers be left scratching heads while trying to justify random nonsense that was put up. Enchantress herself didn't seem interesting at all. Another thing that made no sense was the constant chattering of ""WE'RE THE BAD GUYS!"" We get it, you guys aren't good at all, so shut your mouth and either show flashbacks to justify it or do something that'd make it speak for itself. June Moons should've been left alone and someone with more intricate should've made more impact.
Overall, don't waste your time and data irrespective of the plan you've subscribed to, and give it a miss."
" A bit of a dud to be honest
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,6,"A bunch of incarcerated DC villains are forced to team up and unite in a fight against an evil superpower intent on destroying the world.Yes, it's that unoriginal, a variation on the 'Dirty Dozen' theme. This mess of a film apparently cost a lot to produce, has a seriously miscast Jared Leto as a demented but not physically intimidating Joker and some totally forgettable minor characters. In fact the one plus that raises this film from a four star to a six star review is Margot Robbie. Not only does she make a great Harley Quinn but she manages to outshine Will Smith here, really giving her character an on-screen presence. It's just a shame the rest of the film is forgettable."
" 'Dirty Dozen' cartoon garishly coloured in
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,5,"Despite a good premise - a secret US government project to release the country's imprisoned supervillains to fight an enemy and all the danger of such an initiative - there's just not enough to care about. The tightness of the story set up at he beginning is offset by a clotted storyline that follows. It's a messy production. The characters gleam, and they have different skill sets for oncoming enemies which are amusing, but they have few redeeming features. Every superhero anti-hero film must have a convincing villain to create perspective too and easily toppled walking blackberries and a Disney witch don't cut it in today's marketplace. There's just not enough comedy to make it fun - that's the nub of it. However, the whole thing is saved somewhat by Margot Robbie's perky minx, Harley Quinn, who lit up the screen every time she appeared."
" It's a good movie and nowhere near as bad as people make out.
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,7,"This movie only gets reviews that are so bad because people expect so much for this film, by the trailer, the actors, the characters etc.If this movie came out as relatively unknown then i firmly believe the reviews would be much better.This film could and probably should have been alot better, however, watch the extended version and it gives alot more context to both character and story."
" Disappointing
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,4,"Considering all the hype this has gotten, I was expecting a cracker of a movie, but this fizzled out. The movie just seemed pointless. The story was not well-structured enough and it seemed like the main conflict in the story was brought on by the good guys themselves. I liked the special effects and the background music, but there isn't a lot to write home about. With characters like El Diablo, Harley Quinn and Deadshot, a lot could have been done but this movie just did not work out for me.As an independent movie, without the DC supervillains, I would have rated this higher, because it was somewhat entertaining. But the supervillains just seemed like a waste in this film. Some really bad casting choices- Cara Delevingne was atrocious and I was cringing every time she came on screen. However, Margot Robbie was good as Harley Quinn.This was a waste of time. Left a lot to be desired."
" Sucide Squad was very funny and entertaining
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,10,"I enjoyed this movie so much. I laughed a lot. I was very entertained for the entire film. Everything made sense. There was backstory on all the characters. There was a bad guy(s) that was believable. Surprises that were very well done. And all of you people who are putting 1,2,3,4 and 5 because you were disappointed are ridiculous. You act like every single movie is supposed to blow you out of the water. I think you think way too much of your selves. It's called entertainment. It's not supposed to be realistic all the time especially if it's in the fantasy/comic book realm. Maybe you should suspend your disappointment and your need for realism and just try to enjoy a movie with out having to pick a part what is wrong with it. I waited years to watch this movie because everybody said it was bad. And I laughed hard and I thoroughly enjoyed myself and that was the whole point!!! I will never be listening to you again because you are not reliable. You basically only say your opinion that is very close minded in some little tiny box."
" The worst superhero movie ever
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,1,"The plot does not have any sense from the begining to the end, you are not expecting absolutely notthing original and after 10 minutes when at least you think the fight scenes will be good you notice that even that is terribly done"
" ""The Dirty Dozen"" meets ""The Mummy"" ...
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,4,"...but without the verve or charm that either of those two older movies had. The settings and staging are dark to the point of obsession, and I don't just mean the overall tone of the plot and script. The whole look of it is dark, dirty, and grimy, as if exposing any given scene to sunlight would reveal it for the ridiculousness that it is. A low-life bunch of criminals is conscripted to take down a mystic villain and her long-dead and now resurrected consort. Attempts to make this believable are hard going right from the start and never becoming convincing.What's probably worse though is the derivative nature of what's going on. There's actually nothing original here; any scene is something we've seen before in a different context. Same for the script, which is filled with trite dialog on all sides. The acting? The thing about a bad script and bad premise like this is that it tends to flatten everything, drag all the actors down with it to the same uniform low level even if they're capable people to begin with. There is actually almost no one here among the characters who you feel like rooting for or identifying with. Probably the only cast members who escape with their dignity intact are Will Smith (whose inimitable style seems to be able to carry him through anything) and Viola Davis (whose harder-than-nails Amanda Waller actually borders on believable -- though even she looks like she's rather be somewhere else). I know Margot Robbie is getting credit for standing out among this low bunch, but to me she looked trapped, as if ""how did I get involved in this mess?""was coming out through her eyes whenever she said or did something. Give her credit for trying. As for all the rest, they behave like escapees from the Monty Python School for Overacting. Adam Beach is probably glad that his character got killed off early.What remains is the special effects and CGI. Not bad, but ugliness overtakes them too. The Enchantress (Cara Delavigne) villain does leave a strong impression in both her guises, as some sort of tribal priestess and then as a powerful ancient-god kind of creature, but otherwise the highlights are few.Hard to believe they're intending to make a SS 2 (news as of mid-2018) rather than working on the more promising paths of the DCEU that are starting to open up. This however is probably more a statement about the standards of the studio and Hollywood in general than about anything related to quality."
" I never care about imdb but...
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,1,Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla............. 1/10 this movie deserve it
" Bad
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,2,"This movie was really bad. The worst joker (Leto), the worst Batman (Affleck), one of the worst superhero movie scripts in a long time, awful direction, most of the jokes fall flat, cheesy action and a lame story... a few good things about the movie but not nearly enough to save it from itself. Hopefully there will never be a follow-up, just a complete reboot."
" What a terrible movie!!!!
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,1,The problem with comic book villains on the big screen is that they're treated like anti-hero's instead of villains and that is exactly what this movie did. You get a movie that screws everything the comics put into these characters. No creativity in this film and a cringy bar scene. Why I'm the hell does El Diablo die by an explosion when he has flames as his power and can turn into a damn burning skeleton!! The DC Universe is definitely screwing up with these films and are trying to catch up to the MCU. Who would have expected that the villain would be Suicide Squad member Enchantress who does nothing in this film that causes a damage to any of the other Suicide members. Creating a damn machine to destroy humans when she can just wipe them out instead of wasting time. I was expecting action in this film but was stuck with watching a drama with so much talking. The Joker was pointless in this movie because he's not even a member of the Suicide Squad and Jared Leto cannot play the character right and is a disappointment to the comic book villain. Instead of looking at dangerous villains we're stuck with lame characters that are a waste of time to this Universe.
" When good source material goes bad!
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,2,"Let me start this review by saying that I had high hopes for this movie (I don't really know why either). This film had a strange change in marketing as it got closer to the release which made me feel uneasy going in. Another thing that made me feel this way was the extensive reshoots. But still I went in open minded. Let me start out with what I liked. I enjoyed the soundtrack (outside of the movie) I will return to this subject in the bad. I also enjoyed some of the very brief moments between the squad that actually showed character. Now for the bad. 
#1-The soundtrack: the music tried to do all the heavy lifting that the script and the direction should've been doing. It tried way to hard to tell you how to feel. 
#2-The plot: the plot in the film is so thin that you can barely say there is a plot. It is also needlessly simple. 
#3-Film Structure: The Movie doesn't really have scenes. Sure it has the opening montage but that's what the movie ultimately is, a series of montages. There's a very long extended ""scene"" which is ultimately just the last three quarters of the movie when they're in the city. 
#4-Characters: the characters are not the characters we know and love. They are extremely misguided and the dialogue is so bad that it comes off almost as a spoof of these characters. They hired great talent such as Jared Leto who is surprising horrible in this movie. He is given nothing to do and you can tell in his performance how little help they gave him. Harley Quinn is also an issue. Margot Robbie is a great talent but she ultimately resorts to saying unfunny jokes and supplying the movie with endless shots of her butt. These great characters are stripped of everything that made them great to be one dimensional time wasters. 
#5-David Ayer: I feel like when David Ayer tries he can achieve greatness (Training Day, End Of Watch, Fury) but unfortunately he is so tired and unimaginative as a writer and a sleepwalker as a director now so he produces hot garbage. 
#6-Editing: The Editing In this movie is so jarring. It will randomly have Instagram video edit editing (if that makes sense) where there will Be neon colors on screen for no reason. Also the film has a tone problem. The movie was clearly heavily re-edited in post production. Basically how I feel is that maybe with a different writer & Director and without studio interference this could've been a great movie. However this is once again another dud for DC. When I write this don't think that I am some Marvel fanboy. I am not stranger to ripping one apart. I just enjoy watching good films and I don't settle for mediocrity. This is yet another example of when good source material goes bad."
" LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH & WILL SMITH AS DEADSHOT WAS EXCELLENT
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,9,"FORGET all the silly way over the top & unnecessary Hate this movie has gotten as it's NO WHERE near as bad as it's made out to be!!! First off it's a really fun action packed & really good stunning visual looking blockbuster movie, You can pick bits apart i get that & it may not be absolutely perfect as there is some small faults, but no movie is perfect these days because everyone picks films apart so much that no one just sits back & enjoys the fun entertainment especially with a movie like this, SUICIDE SQUAD is big flashy Cool entertainment & i loved it, i have watched it so many times it's become one of my favourite movies of all time, in my top 5.
SUICIDE SQUAD has also become regular viewing at home with my family, we all love it.Now it's not absolutely perfect & there are bits that Don't make sense but overall there's too much good stuff in this film that those bits Don't really matter!!! The good stuff definitely out weigh it's flaws for me.
One silly bit is the eyeball creatures, that are not very well created, they look silly & totally not scary or threatening & they die way too easily they literally crumble if you hit one hard enough so they are useless bad guys but Enchantress & her big god like brother Incubus, are both fantastic creations.We all have different tastes as ""Deadpool"" i hated, so yeah we all have different tastes with movies & Suicide Squad hit everything i like some how!!!
I'm used to loving films most boring critics hate so that doesn't bother me at all especially after them raving on about how great ""Deadpool"" is when in my opinion it's one of the worst films I've ever seen it's Terrible.Suicide squad introduced me to a darker edgier corner of the DC universe & one i much prefer & that's why Suicide squad is one of my favourite comic book films ever, probably my favourite.
The characters are all great in their own unique way & style, the movie had a throwback dark fantasy feel to it like that of ""Escape from New York"" (1981) & ""Blade Runner"" (1982) like a retro neo-noir look & style that completely satisfies me watching it's magnificent visual style, there's a dark gloomy grungy & almost Cyberpunk look to the film & i loved it. Also the main thing is the Team are a bunch of Great characters that i enjoy spending time with. We all see movies differently & that's ultimately what makes us decide if we like something or not & i absolutely loved, Suicide Squad as my opinion is formed by how i feel about a film & if i loved the characters & here i definitely loved the team & Deadshot blew me away & has become one of my favourite characters ever in any medium.There's so many great scenes & moments that make this so special, i TOTALLY adore this movie & love all the characters but especially ""DEADSHOT"" he's fantastic, my favourite actor is Will Smith & here he didn't disappoint at all, he created one of his best characters & roles of his excellent career & Deadshot needs his own movie.
SMITH gives an emotional & thoughtful performance as the hitman with a heart & troubled mind, really he's the heart & soul of the movie & is so good at grounding all the fantasy action with some grit & heart!!! So SMITH is Excellent & i loved all these touching little scenes with his daughter, Deadshot is such an interesting character that i want to see more of!!! I need his own movie & really explore his dark world more!!!
Deadshot is now one of my favourite movie characters of all time & my favourite DC character.
Also another great thing about this movie is the excellent Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag & his chemistry with will smith's Deadshot but Kinnaman stands out as a great actor & intense screen presence, i love this guy & think he's the best of the new wave of actors out there!!! He's great as the new Robocop & excellent in Run All Night & outstanding in The Informer he's one of my faves!!!also Margot Robbie is great as the crazy but fun Harley Quinn, she is a fantastic actor & completely becomes the character to perfection!!! The other team member characters are absolutely fine & work well together especially DIABLO, played perfectly by JAY HERNANDEZ, a great performance & A big part of why this movie is so good, big mention to WILL & MARGO again though because they really steal the show more on a deeper level with lots of emotional moments that are great, the villain is also great, people hated Enchantress but i loved the demonic ancient witch, she was so cool & visually Awesome to see plus the city scenes look beautiful too, excellent cinematography. Also the music is really great through the film.So yeah one hell of a good ride with great music throughout & an exciting atmosphere, so i don't get all the hate at all? But hey we all have our own opinions!!! I had NEVER heard of suicide squad until this movie or the BRILLIANT ""deadshot"" so I'm not a fan boy maybe that's why i loved it more as i took it completely for what it was? I thank this excellent film for introducing me to these characters especially DEADSHOT my favourite & thank you WILL SMITH for your great performance!!! Great film just enjoy it, i haven't gone on about the plot or story because loads have in great detail so here i am just honestly telling all i LOVE this movie & even with it's faults. This Anti-hero flick is ridiculously entertaining & rewatchable. A fantasy Thriller that has a gritty & grimy neon drenched look & the imagery of the empty city is beautiful & very 80s style, again BEAUTIFUL cinematography with a fantastic music score, A really well directed film with a great atmosphere of dark fun & humour, very stylish.
Also Joker was excellent even if it's a small part it's still a solid part of an overall bigger story & Jared Leto was excellent in all his incredible scenes.
I also loved the inclusion of Ben Affleck as Batman, he's the greatest Batman ever in my opinion & including him in a few small scenes was an Awesome idea as he connects all the rich comic book history & it's universe. There's so many great bits to this movie that i just enjoy it all for what it is.I honestly think Director David Ayer done an excellent job considering all the tampering by the Studio & I'm not the only one who thought so as Deadshot himself, Will Smith went straight on to work with him again on the, also underrated fantasy Thriller Bright a Netflix original movie, another great film by the visionary Director!!!
Some scenes are really great in Suicide Squad, such as the opening introduction scenes to each character, especially Deadshot's scene it's Awesome. All the subway/station scenes with big warrior monster Incubus are excellent & full of Horror atmosphere. To be honest i think Deadshot steals the show & every single scene he appears in because Will Smith is such a good actor & a powerful screen presence, most of the best scenes involved Deadshot such as the excellent Gun-range training scene where he shows his Amazing shooting skills & deadly Aim. I also loved the scenes in the rain when the gang head in to an abandoned bar for a drink it's a nice group scene of talking, bonding & opening-up, a good character moment. Probably the most fun & exciting & action packed sequence is the gun-blazing ""Ally way battle"" when the Squad & soldiers first encounter the ""Eye Creatures"" & Deadshot pretty much shoots them all to bits as he stands on top of a car, it's a spectacular action sequence & sets in stone just how Dangerous & how Cool Deadshot is. The Squad all seem to look to Deadshot for their next move as if he's the leader & i liked that. The big battle with Enchantress at the end is an Epic special effects spectacle & really looks fantastic & a powerful last shot by Deadshot aiming while drenched in the pouring rain & a beautiful piece of music that enhances the scene to really get the emotions going, an epic scene.Love SUICIDE SQUAD & will continue to watch it more & more, it's made my all time top 10 fave movies,
The reason it got rated a 9/10 is because it sits just under an ""Instant Classic"" or ""MASTERPIECE"" because there is some faults with it, it's not perfect but it's still one hell of a fun ride with a great Squad of characters & will definitely become a FUTURE CULT CLASSIC I'm sure."
" It was actually pretty decent
",2018-07-18 00:00:00,7,"I understand why people didn't really like it but personally I thought it was ok. The chemistry of the cast is pretty good, their backstory is short yet well developed and the jokes are pretty funny. Will Smith and Margot Robbie are like the breakout stars of this movie. The biggest disappointment is the virtual absence of the Joker. This's a good example of misleading marketing: Many of the trailers depict The Joker as a major character in the movie yet he only makes a handful of appearances in the actual movie. I do agree that the story could've been more developed but all in all it's pretty decent."
" The worst
",2018-07-11 00:00:00,5,"They tried to connect different characters in the same movie, but that didn't work out. I was waiting till the end in hope that something will happened..."
" Not giving up on this being a good franchise
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,4,"Joker and Harley's back story and injection of Joker throughout the movie just muddled the storyline.. backstory.. character.. backstory.. character.. plotline was all over the place ... the joker should have made one appearance.. the last scene. Viola Davis reminds me of Lynne Thigpen from ""Where in the World is Carmen San Diego"" it needed a bad ass General cast.."
" Lack of character development
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,5,"Would have liked to have seen better character development, especially the bad guys. 
Joker was a horrible rendition. Not so much Leto's fault, just bad idea from writer. 
Tried too hard to modernize and use street level criminal characters to try and infuse complex character plots, which just didn't fit, and wasn't believable. 
Could have been so much more. But it just got lost in corny dialog."
" I genuinely have no idea why people like this garbage
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,1,"While many people will probably disagree with me I am not changing my opinion that this was the worst film of 2016... by far. Yes it's worse than Nine Lives, Norm of the North and Gods of Egypt. This is mainly due to the fact that it is a confused mess and that is mainly due to the amount of edits and re-edits it has had. Many have said this was a production nightmare with absolutely no control. It is known that there were three main edits that were made for this film. One was approved by the Director (David Ayer), One was edited and approved by a studio that makes movie trailers, and the final edit was a mix of the two previously mentioned. Whoever's decision it was to put the third edit I mentioned in theatres must have been absolutely hammered that day. This particular edit leads to problems that include the worst pacing that a film has ever had, editing that looks dull at points or flashy and tacky the next minute, a first act that feels like a bunch of trailers mix mashed and jammed together (not to mention this is all while three people are eating steak). This combination leads to underdeveloped or non existent character arcs.Even if the editing and pacing were good the movie would still be god awful because the story makes no sense, the plot is beyond predictable and boring, and the characters all grated on my nerves (except deadshot because he was boring). Overall this movie is unbearable for me."
" This is what happens when you let the garbage can spill over
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,1,"Suicide squad. Smells, sounds, tastes, looks and acts like crap; I t's probably crap. This is definitely crap."
" Total disappointment
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,1,"I'm completely glad I did not spend my money to watch this junk in the cinemas. After watching this film on TV, I did not regret not going cinemas for this. The main problem with the film was that it was 95% long, boring talk which was ridiculously stuffy and hammy. And with that, only a few minutes of action scenes. The second worst part of the film was when the crazy witch appeared and this is where pretty much everything else went wrong. That part of the film was 10/10 cringe-worthy. Don't even watch this film for free! It's that bad!"
" What if time.
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,1,"Really Will Smith. He really sucked in the movie and the Joker. What a joke, he so sucked in the movie. The movie try to hard."
" A Suicidal Name
",2018-06-29 00:00:00,1,"The movie have everything, especial effect , lot of good actors . But seriously lacks a interesting Plot and realistic storyline . And How you can name a group suicide squad when initially they ware forced to participate in action . The name is negative . 
Will smith is always a great expectation, but not at this one ."
" WASTE
",2018-06-27 00:00:00,4,"Great performances, effects, makeup, costume.
Everything else was awful"
" In the middle
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,6,The joker is great in my opinion. I think that the joker and Harley are the best people in the film but the characters that annoyed me were Captain Boomerang and Killer Croc. There were some good scenes and some awful scenes but I would recommend it to a lot of D.C. fans!
" A complete letdown
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,4,"After the immense amount of hype surrounding this film, I was excited. After seeing how great this movie looked in trailers, I was getting more pumped and pumped. But, after watching this, I hung my head low, I was so dissapointed. I wanted to love this movie so bad, but with all the things wrong with it, I just can't whatsoever. It is one of, if not the most disappointingly mediocre and somewhat boring comic book movie I've ever seen. The movie focuses way too hard on character development, and while that doesn't sound terrible, it shouldn't be the main focus of the entirety of the movie, because it mostly is. And because of this, this movie is mostly exposition and little to nothing else. It's still not as bad as it was in Fant4stic, but it is still grating nonetheless. The action scenes in this movie are never more than just passable. They're not bad, but they never have that tense feeling that many other action scenes from previous movies had. The only remotely thrilling moment is at the end of the movie, and the fact that it's this way is extremely disappointing that the filmmakers didn't add more of that to the rest of this movie. Also, the Joker is not as much in this movie as he should be. This sucks, because Jared Leto is an awesome Joker, but the fact that he's only in a few scenes just makes his character have a lot untapped potential. I hope to see more of him in the possible sequel. This movie, despite these incredibly dissapointing low points, isn't really awful, as it does have a few redeeming qualities. One is the soundtrack, as it is one of the absolute best I've heard in a comic book movie, right next to Guardians Of The Galaxy 1 and 2. Another are the performances. Everyone in this film did a fantastic job and they were very entertaining in each of their roles. Another are the visuals and presentation, as everything looks great and the special effects do add a lot to a few scenes. Despite these high points, they just aren't enough to save this movie, as it is nothing more than just a film filled with exposition and a few action sequences and nothing more. I'm sure hardcore fans of DC will enjoy this film, but I just couldn't that much, as there are so many better films out there. Overall, despite this movie not necessarily being terrible, it is still, in my opinion, a complete letdown."
" Beautiful movie.
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,7,What's with all the haters? What did they expect? Did they think Suicide Squad would contend for an Oscar?I really enjoyed this movie for the same reason I loved the first two Batman movies. Suicide squad is like a comic book come to life. The colors just pop and the CGI is amazing. It's not cerebral. It's not the best film of the year. It's just a fun movie. Loved it.
" Perfect title, bad movie
",2018-06-15 00:00:00,4,"Some of the most dangerous criminals are released from prison in order to help peoples from a dangerous entity. And that's all there is to say about the plot but the execution was horrible. The first hour is watchable and kinda entertaining but after boredom sets in. There is only a few action time in over 2 hours, about 15 minutes and it's not great at all.There are many bad parts but the ones I notice are : batman appears for like 20 seconds and what is his purpose? Seems that he is in the wrong movie at the wrong time and at the wrong moment. Also what's with that parody of the joker? Looks creepy and cheap. Overall more action less talking and it could have been much better."
" I didn't heed the warnings, and I wish I did.
",2018-06-13 00:00:00,2,"They say that most of Jared Leto's scenes were left on the cutting-room floor. That's the good news. And that's as humorous as I can be about this. You don't have to be a fanboy to see that the approach was all wrong; to the characters, the tone, even the soundtrack. I don't want to throw gas on the fire here, but the quicker I can forget about this Hot Topic DC movie, the better.It's godawful."
" The Ho-hum Squad
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,5,"I went to the movie theatre with my husband with very little expectations about this film and left feeling even less enthusiastic about it. The points I have given are for the effects and for Margot Robbie's acting. She's a tad exaggerated as Harley Quinn but appealing in her effort to justify her role. The rest of the squad looked like they had all been hired the last minute and did it for the obvious reason, in dollar signs. If there's a chance for you to watch it for free and you ain't got nothing to do then it's your risk. I normally don't regret anything but having spent my money on this ho-hum movie , I mentally crucified myself for that ."
" Achoo! (The release of this movie in a nutshell) NOT YET FINISHED
",2018-06-03 00:00:00,2,"Don't get me wrong, I like the characters of Deadshot and Harley Quinn and to a certain extent, I do like the animated Suicide Squad movie Batman: Assault On Arkham which could of saved this movie if they just made a live action version of it but unfortunately, the movie tries to be its own original piece of 'intellectual property' and falls completely flat on it's face. I can at least appreciate the fact that it tried to be a thing of it's own but the story is so awful. Ok, I know that Superman has died but we still have Batman, The Flash and Wonder Woman around but apparently, the villains were the best choice."
" Boring
",2018-06-03 00:00:00,1,"Nothing happens throughout the entire 2 hour run time. There are some so bad it's good scenes, but you have to watch suicide squad to get to them."
" Suicide Squad a great action-comedy thriller!
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,7,"By Michael SturekThe combination of characters throughout the DC comics into one movie, was an interesting experiment, but it was effective in the end. Suicide Squad directed by David Ayer featured an excellent soundtrack and cast, but it lacked a stable and exciting plot. The well chosen cast led by actor Will Smith was one of the first things I noticed in this action-comedy thriller. Smith portrayed the villain turned hero Deadshot, which was supported by famous actors, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Jared Leto as The Joker.  The movie begins with capturing and imprisoning of each of the villains. Each villain is given a thrilling backstory that sucks up the viewers attention. The imprisoned villains are visited by the lady in charge of Task Force X, Amanda Waller, which is portrayed by Viola Davis. Waller has assembled these villains into the expected disaster (at the time) Task Force X. The task force is led by a highly decorated Military Veteran Rick Flag played by Joel Kinnaman. Flag is dating Dr. June Moone, played by Cara Delevingne, who has the power to transform into an evil Queen, Enchantress, by whispering her alter ego ""Enchantress"". While on a mission Dr. Moone loses control of her alter ego, and Enchantress takes over, releasing her evil brother, Incubus. The Task Force X is sent in to destroy the threat on Midway City.  The director, David Ayer is a very established and successful director in the film industry. He is most famous for directing Suicide Squad, Bright, Fury, Training Day, and Sabotage. Ayer has been a director for more than 15 years and has made a name for himself. He draws in famous actors for both his large roles and supporting actors/actresses. In Suicide Squad, the lead role is portrayed by Will Smith as Deadshot. Smith has had a long acting career most famously in his role of Will Smith in the hit television show, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Smith's supporting actress Margot Robbie who plays Harley Quinn has appeared in many films, most famously in the films, Wolf of Wall Street, I, Tonya, and Focus, which also featured Smith.
 
 My favorite parts of the film were the cast, soundtrack, and the setting of the film. The soundtrack was created by, Steven Price. The soundtrack featured famous songs: ""Heathens"" by Twenty One Pilots, ""Purple Lamborghini"" by Skrillex and Rick Ross, ""Sucker For Pain"" by Lil Wayne, Wiz Khalifa, and Imagine Dragons. The use of this excellent soundtrack added the needed emotion to the action scenes throughout this thriller. The initial setting of the film was in Toronto, Ontario. The final battle between the self declared Suicide Squad and the evil brother and sister duo occured in Midway City, which is modeled after the famous city Chicago, Illinois. The setting provided a realistic battle occuring in a large, important city. The director also used the weather to make the scene more dramatic and lively. Ayer brought the rain into the final battle scene which threw a new element into this already difficult battle. The genre of this film is action-comedy. The actors and scripts promote both action comedy. Many movies do not use this kind of tactic for an action movie, however Suicide Squad did an excellent job bringing both action and comedy together to form a great overall movie. Some other films that use this action-comedy genre are both Deadpool and Deadpool 2.  Suicide Squad combined many different characters from the DC comic universe and created an excellent action-comedy thriller. Although I am a big Marvel comic fan and have not explored the DC comics, this movie was an excellent introductory to the DC comics for me. I believe that this movie was excellent despite the difficult plot to follow, however the cast, soundtrack, and setting made up for the plot."
" A Bad Guys Fun Movie
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,8,I don't get the hate this movie gets. It's a great way to introduce these characters barring Harley Quinn (cause everyone knows her). The story was ok and the acting was great by every actor. Margot Robbie is a perfect Harley Quinn. Joker wasn't given much screen time so cant say anything about him.
" The worst Oscar-winning film of all time
",2018-05-28 00:00:00,1,"On my first viewing, I thought this film was okay, and on second viewing I proceeded to slap the stupid out of myself until my head nearly fell off, and it's such a dull mess that I don't even know where to begin, but I will attempt to do so nonetheless.Here's the good, and it's going to be very short. Harley Quinn was excellent in this film and she gets a lot of screen time, and she feels like the only character even attempting to make this a fun experience. Margot Robbie's performance is probably the only reason I was fine with the film in the first place, but it's not a good excuse.Every other character is dark and gritty, wallowing in their self-pity, and they're all a bit despicable. Deadshot is probably the second best, being mediocre and not so offensive as the others, however the film focuses on him as the main character essentially though he was not interesting enough to carry the film. He's an impossibly skilled assassin who's also a father going through a divorce while his ex-wife is an irresponsible mother, which is essentially the same thing we see in every Oscar-baiting drama ever made. Killer Croc is probably the worst simply since he gets no development or depth at any point which is a missed opportunity at morbid cannibalistic humor. Diablo is probably the only character with development, however it happens much too late in the film and the reveal comes off as contrived, and leaves him being the least active character up until the end of the film. Boomerang is simply as bland as his name sounds. Katana shows up later than the rest of the squad, and her gimmick is a sword that traps souls and has her husband's soul trapped inside, and there's no payoff to this revelation and she hardly has any screen time. There's another guy called Slipknot, the man who can climb anything, and he is the only character not to get an introduction, so it's painfully obvious that he's entirely expendable.The introduction of the film is a complete mess right out of the gate. There are literally two introductions for the main cast done back to back with popular music tossed in, making it come off as a cheap fan-made music video. There are several origin stories blasting through at the speed of light here, combining the superhero film fatigue, origin story fatigue, and whiplash of terrible pacing all together into a projectile vomit-inducing concoction.The basic plot is horribly cliche and contrived. First of all, the main conflict in the story is caused by Waller in her creation of the Suicide Squad, which isn't a concept that made any sense in the first place. Why would she think it to be a good idea to put together a team of rowdy baddies to ""fight the next Superman"" in case he were to be bad?Seriously, I understand they wanted a fun movie with bad guys being forced to fight together for good and subvert our expectations of villains, but none of that is executed effectively. Enchantress also has the MacGuffin, yada yada, giant light in the sky, and she's overpowered, leading to a dull final confrontation at the end. The monsters throughout the movie were also incredibly dull, as they were just guys in suits with weird black orbs all over their bodies, undoubtedly for the PG-13 rating.This really should have been a hard R, especially considering it came after Deadpool. It feels like a dull DP ripoff that's constantly pulling its punches since it's more concerned with marketability rather than entertainment. There's also edgy content with the Joker and Harley that feels forced. The scene in the strip club served no purpose beyond tossing in more sex appeal and killing off another character from the comics within a minute of first being shown on the big screen.The editing is incredibly jarring. The relationship between Joker and Harley was clearly edited to make the relationship seem more mutual, and thus it truly ruins the Joker's character beyond making him into a thug. There is a moment when Joker pushes Harley out of a helicopter, but it's cut in a way to reframe it to be like he was saving her and sacrificing himself instead of a morbid prank where he was trying to push her to cause harm.This Joker is clearly the worst Joker to date, which is hilarious considering how much insanity there was with Jared Leto around this film. After all his insane real life harassment and supposed method acting, all there is to show for it is what feels like five minutes of total screen time and only one line that can even be considered a joke. He acted as nothing more than a plot device for a couple of scenes with Harley Quinn that weren't the least bit important to the story ultimately, thus he was useless to the film and would have almost been better cut out entirely. Jared Leto's an overhyped person in general who claims to be an actor and a musician despite producing no quality performances for either line of work.It's hilarious that people defend this film so strongly as it's the sloppiest pile of garbage DC has offered us so far, and the one good aspect of it is simply not enough to make up for the countless flaws throughout by a long shot."
" Nowhere near as bad as made out
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,7,"In a world devastated by the death of Superman, and still getting used to the threats posed by metahumans, scheming Amanda Waller brings together a group of criminals with ""gifts"" to be used on deniable operations: force them into working as a covert task force, and throw them under the bus if things go wrong.Suicide Squad continues the expansion of DC's cinematic universe into the darkness established by Man Of Steel and Batman v Superman: arguably the Squad is a more appropriate vehicle for this direction than DC's flagship Big Blue Boyscout (SPOILER: he's dead now, anyway, his funeral featuring briefly in the opening minutes of SS). Paradoxically, SS is somewhat lighter than Snyder's two Superman movies, although I emphasise that ""somewhat"" actually means ""not much.""This film has been critically mauled, but it's nowhere near as bad as has been made out. Dark, certainly, but this is a group of murderous criminals, so you shouldn't expect a super-powered version of the A-Team - these aren't nice people. Having said that, Will Smith's Deadshot is a murdering hitman with a young daughter he dotes on, thus making him a morally compromised bloke you can identify with. And Margot Robbie, the sexiest thing on screen this year so far, IS Harley Quinn. They gave us (blink and you'll miss it) Alex Ross' Mad Love cover - thank you!Unfortunately, the rest of the Squad don't do so well. They all get origins and moments in the spotlight during combat, but there is precious little for them in terms of character and backstory. Consequently it is difficult to care much about them, and the film lacks heart as a result.But there's bags of action, a decent threat, and one really good scene where they take a timeout in a deserted bar, and we get some idea of what the inter-relationships and dynamics of the group might have been had the script spent more time on character and less on expending ordnance aka blowing crap up. DC still hasn't figured out why the Marvel cinematic movies are so successful: we care about the characters. Here - not so much.Overall, though, I enjoyed this. I have recently been reading John Ostrander's original run writing the Suicide Squad comic in the 80s, and this film is at least as good as that.Don't bother with a 3D viewing - it adds nothing."
" I want to suicide
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,4,"Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto, Cara Delevigne , Scott Eastwood and many more good actors are in this movie 
But compared to the cast the movie is awful
DC tried to make a big campaign to promote the movie more than they tried to make it work
I had really high expectations , and I was very dissatisfied and disappointed 
Why ? (No spoilers)
First, they had a plot but they didn't develop it well , the script wasn't good and left a lot of plot holes 
Second, after what Heath Ledger did with the character « The Joker » DC have to work very hard to develop the character and give him an important role in the film, but they didn't, which made them loose a key element for the movie
Third, the principal villain. I didn't like the villain at all, boring , uninteresting , and not dark or creepy. If we look back to other DC villains like The Joker in The Dark Knight played by Heath Ledger or Bane in The Dark Knight Rises played by Tom Hardy , we see a big difference .Suicide Squad was awful , and I regret watching it. From now on, I will not watch any other DC movie anymore ."
" Good looking but not great
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,6,"The fact that a friend of mine lent me this on DVD and it's taken 12 months for me to finally pop the disc into my player reflects my lack of interest in superhero movies. Or perhaps superbaddies in this case?? I didn't even bother to read the case or the opening credits & was surprised that I didn't recognise Will Smith until the closing ones!
Starts off very well and is a very good looking film in terms of action but I just found that the second half slowed down & I started to slightly lose interest. BUT there is one very good reason to see this - Margot Robbie! Very sexy."

" This adio visual produckt is not a movie
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,1,"The movie is about the ""bad guys"" kind of like guardians of the galaxy. It is actually very easy to notes the parallels it is suppose to be a ""fun"" ""action"" ""movie"". But it completely failed of beaing all three of those the fird beaing a movie. You can se that the 
It is simple to explain this movie it is so bad made with scenes without beginnings or ends and no substance. The movie is edited like a trailer NOT LIKE A MOVIE!!! The movie is not enjoyable this is becose the action is so bland and poorly made and the special effects are the same so you just can't enjoy the movie. The movie is not ""fun"" the characters are so flat that you don't like them or wath they are saying. Becose the dialogue is so dumb specely Harley Quinn's witch is suppose to be dumb I know her charakter but it is not dumb fun. And what is worse is that it's atatched to a bunch of really talented actors.
 This is yet another movie in the dc cinematic universe. I did not se bvs or Man of Steal so i did not get any of the warnings from the earlier dc movies. I wanted to watch this movie because I generally like batman and it's characters it's i watched asult on Arkham before I watched this movie to hype my selfe and that movie was good becose it was edited like a real movie.When I watched this my eyes wanted to jump out of my head and take a break. This movie I mean adio visuell product locks gray and it is filmed at night so you can't see anything. And when the creators relised this they decided to put some colourful filters over the cenes to make it look more colourful but instead it turned out to lock eawen worse.
To me I thaugth this movie took place in one of dc's manny parallel universes like the earth one becose the carakters are not the one from dc comics. The cakarakters in the movie are based on the caracters from dc comics except the peple who designed these carakters don't understand dc's carakters. The worst example of this is the joaker. In Batman the killing joke the joakers backstory was revealed and twist was that it was not the gas that made him mad but the nhyalism and therefore he trues to get he's message of that anyone can become a nhyalist if brungen to he's position. In this movie they just fought oh he is crazy so let's just make him that. Same thing with Harley insetead of making her karakter they just did her she is crazy and hot... that is it that is the levels of flat ckarakters where talking about.It is a chame that they made the karakters this becose this is why moast pepole like superherostorys. The carakters and what they stand for."
" entertaining enough
",2018-05-04 00:00:00,6,"It's way better than I expected after all the critics. A popcorn movie which isn't too predictible. No master piece but makes a movie night. When you already know Assault on Arkham Ayslum: get the hint. It's not a Joker movie, so it doesn't need to have the greatest Joker of all time (which it really hasn't)."
" A suicide, indeed
",2018-04-26 00:00:00,4,"The movie started off great with really cool introductions, but from there it all goes down the drain. This movie had the potential to be the dark, crude and gritty super-anti-hero movie that would be a refreshing twist to the comicbook adaptions. Sadly, it's a shallow non-dimensional mess that fails to be funny, and concludes in a mythological stand-off which feels severely displaced in this universe, and rather something that belongs in The Mummy. DCU really killed their potential with Suicide Squad."
" UM....OK?
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,7,"Jeez what's wrong with me??
I love this move. Yeah a little corn fed but but thought it was very entertaining!"

",2018-04-22 00:00:00,1,"Why did they make this movie so poorly, really have not enjoyed anything less, stayed till the end, but only in the hope of something that never came.Script was atrocious!The Enchantress character was over the top!No need for this to be made in its current form!It made $500 Million, my kids bought he Harley Quinn T-Shirt and poster and other merch, so it was just an infomercial and not a movie.1/2 out of 10"
" What The Hell Happened
",2018-04-21 00:00:00,2,"Suicide Squad is written and directed by David Ayer and stars Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Jared Leto and Joel Kinnaman.Despite the constant rage against this movie, I tried to have an open mind while watching it but in the first 7 minutes I was like...'oh no'This movie feels like a drunk person watched some of the trailers and wrote down what he thinks happens, because there are scenes where characters are introduced and a scene later are intoduced again like you havn't met them already. Scenes lead to something completely different. Charcters will feel mad in a scene and in the next feel fine. I've seen movies with bad editing before, but the editing in this...IT KILLED THE MOVIE!Will Smith is given some dumb lines but his charm does come through most of the time. Margot Robbie did okay and I like some of the ideas they had for Harley Quinn but their just not met to their full potential. I thought characters like El Diablo and Katana were kinda cool but they both aren't given that much to do. Then you have Jared Leto as the Joker...he was TERRIBLE, it's like they got Jim Carrey to play him, but he was always on the verge of climaxing!When there are scenes of character development, even if the scene itself is decent I didn't feel anything becuase these people never really connect but at the end of the movie they're all like ""I lost one family, I ain't gonna loose another one"" WHERE DID THAT COME FROM, YOU'VE KNOWN EACHOTHER FOR 2 HOURS!It's almost as if they told five people to direct their own individual Suicide Squad movies and then when they were all done, they had put them all together into one movie.While this isn't an irredeemable awful movie, it really, really, REALLY sucks but it isn't awful, at the same time it is kind of a disaster because they had this much talent infront and behind the camera and they had so many possibilities for this being the FIRST all villains comic book movie and this is what we get. This is GARBAGE"
" The best thing about this movie is probably a product placement by Samsung
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,2,"I liked the performance of Jared Leto. Will Smith is pretty much the same as in any other movie but he is a good actor though in a pointless, not entertaining movie. The make-up is obviously good (especially if it won an Oscar) but you don't get to enjoy it much. The movie is completely predictable, performances of most actors average, in some cases below average. I was disappointed with Margot Robbie, she is a good actress but this role was for someone else. Only after watching the movie and reading the cast and crew, I realized there is no Mila Kunis in this but to me previously unknown Cara Delevingne. I think at 21 years old, I am too old for this movie, it was probably aimed at teenagers and kids. There is no violance, it all feels pale and plain boring. Overall, very disappointed. But the movie is a huge hit according to box office and I find it kind of sad that so many good films have no success but a thing like this does."
" Finally an adult DC film again!
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,10,"I will start off by saying I am biased against Marvel. I dislike anything Marvel makes and their fanbase are mostly kids who hate DC. I saw this x2 in theaters because it was amazing. This is the ONLY movie I like that Will Smith has EVER done. The entire cast is great, this movie is dark, edgy, and has that evil sense of humor I enjoy. I always side with evil and the bad guys and this was just perfect. Jared Leto as Joker surpasses any other to date and feels more psychotically real than ever! He creeps me out when I watch him but in a twisted love kind of way. Its hot. Heath Ledger was close but Leto dominates his role as THE psycho of Gotham. The story was fresh to me and I wish hollywood would make more films this raw. I purchased the limited edition steel book of this and could not be happier! Finally DC delivered!!!Reviews should be short and to the point IMHO I do not want to read a novel about it."
" It's Okay
",2018-04-14 00:00:00,5,"While Margot Robbie, Will Smith, and Viola Davis give fun and very charismatic performances, in fact I'd say most of the cast does.

" Waste of time

" Predictable and Cheesy

" It's, just alright
",2018-04-10 00:00:00,5,"Suicide Squad learned from some of BVS's mistakes, then made a bunch of new ones. First, I loved most of the cast. Margot Robbie was great as was Will Smith who both tried to get something out of this odd movie and dumb script. The editing is so choppy and erratic that it's hard to watch at times. It's funnier than previous DC films which is a welcome change, but humor isn't going to save this so called ""cinematic universe"". It's not anywhere near as awful at Batman V Superman, but it is also it's own brand of bad. It's a movie with several great highs, but way to many lows To be called good. At best it's average. At worst, well, you know."

" A big money-grubbing middle finger to all comic fans!
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,2,"It's not often that a movie I had such low expectations for actually exceeds or fails (depending on your outlook) to even live up to those. This movie barely even qualifies AS a movie. It's THAT ridiculous. I consider it basically a music video for teenagers to ogle Harley Quinn who is made so cringe-worthy by Robbie. There are hardly any movies I could think of at this level of budget that banked harder on a single characters' sex appeal selling out seats. It's so over-the-top in the trailers it makes me feel sorry for her and the production company for making such an obvious attempt to trade boners for ticket sales. Apart from all that, the characters are terrible. Will Smith who has a mountain of charisma somehow had zero in this film. I won't blame him. The rest of the crew are so terrible they don't even warrant a mention. Except for the Joker. He technically isn't PART of their crew but he is in there. Lord above who decided on THAT way to portray the Joker? Instead of a laughing and unpredictable madman we get some poor Halloween pimp/gangster. Seriously? Nothing about this movie was good. It only slightly entertained me in that it was terrible and that entertained me."
" Good, not great
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,7,"Enjoyable film but I don't really have the greatest knowledge of the suicide squad, the main reason I was looking forward to this film was, The Joker. However sorry to say but Leto as the joker was just terrible, I truely believe no one will ever top what Heath Ledger done as the joker. Still this film was pretty good but probably could've been better."
" A great big noisy mess
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,1,"This film really does not deserve an in-depth analytical review. It is 25% exposition and 75% whatever. It also gives us a Joker portrayed by a method actor who knows how to internalize a character, but not how to project the character (the latter being why Ledger was so great). Leto's Joker is just as lame, unbelievable, and indescribably annoying as Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. 
Rather than picking the thing apart, perhaps it is best said that WB/DC should simply pretend that this movie never happened, then recast the Joker before The Batman is made. I wish they would to the same with Luthor. (Why is it that Marvel can do such a good job but DC can't? It's because Marvel knows how to cut through the Hollywood BS and hire the right people and DC doesn't.)"
" The DCEU is DOA
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,1,"It started off as a cool concept.
Incarcerated supervillains being used as government pawns to reluctantly work together and stop greater threats? Yeah, that's cool.
Then they picked some of the least interesting DC Villains to work with. Now I know, you can't just comprise the whole cast of heavy hitters, you gotta bring in some obscure benchwarmers from the lineup so you don't blow it all too quickly. This film's cast is nothing but 2nd rate benchwarmers from the DC lineup. 
Then the first trailer came out. Then came the rewrites. And the reshoots. Every link on the chain of command rusted, came apart and turned to dust on the ground. The excessive reshoots and rewrites causing millions of dollars of budget to simply disappear, created a perfect storm of continuity errors from plot points that make no sense because their setup was established in scenes that were cut, to characters that are established in the beginning and proceed to become ghosts for the rest of the movie. Examples: Katana, the girl whose blade is so sharp it cut her scenes out of the movie, and Slipknot (the man who can climb anything) who became quite literally a ghost within 10 minutes of his introduction and had less than a minute of actual screentime. The main plot twist of the movie makes no sense within the film's context, and the main moral dilemma at the end is a trashfire because Deadshot and Rick Flag's inner conflicts make no sense, and the stakes are completely removed at the end meaning the moral dilemma was pointless from the getgo.
The soundtrack is the least memorable big-budget action movie schlock you'd expect from a film like this. That is, when it's even present rather than licensed music that is so painfully on-the-nose that it makes me wish I was wearing earplugs. In fact the original score for the film is unmemorable for two reasons; A) It's incredibly generic and B) it's barely even there.
The used needle icing on the medical waste cake that is this movie, is the horrible editing. A trailer house was brought in to put this Humpty-Dumpty film back together. Surprise surprise, they couldn't. The entire movie suffers from continuity errors, horrible pacing, bad framing and atrocious visual appeal. Since the film was pieced together by a trailer house, the entire film feels like every scene is another trailer back to back, it feels like a preview that never ends.
It's an insulting mismatch of a film that couldn't be worse if Uwe Boll dreamt it up."
" really is Hollywood joking???

" Dissapointed dosent come close
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,2,"There must be a marvel agent paying the dc directors to make crap films because I don't see how they can all turn out so bad. After seeing the trailers I thought this would be my movie of the year and one to finally put dc on the map, how wrong was I? The actors to be fair all play the parts well but the story is so boring and bland it's painful. Please do better with the sequel and maybe actually put the joker in it this time!!!"
" Great movie don't understand the hate
",2018-03-16 00:00:00,8,Well I will say I hated the joker in this movie it's terrible gimmicky sh$t other wise I love it!
" This movie is garbage.
",2018-03-13 00:00:00,3,"This movie is garbage.I have nothing great to say about it. The soundtrack was cool, except it made no sense. They just sprinkled in different songs, with some of them being covers.Will Smith was great as Will Smith. Margot Robbie is attractive and she plays a comic accurate Harley Quinn. Killer Croc has ""haha lol"" one-liners. Captain Boomerang exists.But Slipknot is the best character. He's the guy that climb anything.The Enchantress is a terrible villain. The only worse villain than her was Amanda Waller, the person that started the Suicide Squad.Will Smith says the words ""Are we some kind of Suicide Squad"" in the movie.The editing looks like it was done by a trailer company. Oh wait - it was done by a trailer company.Don't watch it, it's bad."
" Pure incompetence.
",2018-03-13 00:00:00,1,"Visuals - The whole look of this movie is bad. The color palette is gross. The effects are cheap and bad. Visually pretty much everything is terrible. I guess some of the costumes are ok, but that's a bit of a stretch. The editing is terrible. You don't even have to look it up to know that this movie was made by a trailer company. Plot - This is a dumb concept presented poorly. If this movie was made by a competent studio, then it could've at least been fun. Villan - All the characters are villains. I know that's kind of the point, but again, the idea is handled extremely poorly. Comedy - There are a few scenes where this movie feels like its trying to be funny. Its really not. Characters - All the characters are cliches. None of the characters are interesting. They're all really flat. Most of the characters act like total morons. Action - Most of the action is really bad. The bit where Margot Robbie runs up the wall and ceiling of an elevator in high heels without strings to swing a bat at a CG monster is pretty impressive. Other than that its all terrible. Sounds - There's a lot of really bad music. This movie doesn't have anything going for it. Its just so bad and nonsensical. The only reason you'd watch it is if you're a DC fanboy/girl or if you like Harley Quinn's butt."
" Even white trash needs super heroes they can identify with
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,1,"This is like if you took good comic book characters, got them hooked on smack, broke them out of a methadone clinic, and decided to make a pointless movie with them. Its really just ""Mean faced"" dialogue then ""round house kicks"" then ""shooting"" then ""mean face dialogue"". Its text book writing, ya know, if that text book was ""Writing scripts for dummies"" the fact they tried to pipe in an emotional arc with the one character having a daughter was absolutely laughable. You literally do not give a damn about a single character. And harlequin is just disgusting to even look at. Actually just her ""look"" alone made me not watch it until years later...Will smith was the only reason I gave it a chance. Thinking maybe it was bad advertising and the thing could be surprisingly good. But nope. Between stupid dialog, stupid plot lines, i cant bend my mind enough to accept this as a form of entertainment. Not without getting myself hooked on smack, check in to a methadone clinic, then watch it on their tv. Just to stay positive the one thing I liked about the movie was the budget, Must have been a nice budget."
" more than a missed opportunity
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,4,"I'm astounded by how much wasted money was poured into this movie. if the studio and the producers saw the script, why did they fund this movie? there are an incredible number of flaws, so much so that I'd call the movie a flaw in and of itself and it'd be quicker to name what's good about the movie. but there's no fun in that, so let's run through what makes this flick horrible.the base plot. you can't have the suicide squad going on a mission to fight a supernatural and/or magical entity. in almost every iteration of the suicide squad, at least half of the team has no superhuman ability, or at least a power that's not very, well, powerful. this adaptation is one of those, with the entire squad being basically powerless except for diablo. so most of the squad is essentially useless during the most important parts of the movie, seeing that the main villain is a magical witch and her brother. a lot of the plot details.
-what was the point of keeping the full details of the mission secret for so long? the squad can't do anything anyway. they have bombs in their necks.-the beef between flag and deadshot that headed off most of the first half of the movie just didn't make sense. it was inorganic, and we all knew how it would end.-thrusting bits and pieces of the harley quinn/joker backstory into the movie here and there was both annoying and confusing-the camaraderie between the group felt very fake and shoehorned by the end. -and others i can't remember off of the top of my head.the script. deadshots lines were absolutely horrible most of the time. diablo's were a little cliché as well. flag's weren't great. harley quinn's were fine, but i'll expand on her below. but i have to say, killer croc had the worst dialogue of any superhero movie this century, hands down. it's hard to put it into a review without going through the movie scene by scene, but if you watch you'll probably know what i mean when i say that the script could've been better written by an average liberal arts sophomore.the acting i guess was alright. i would attack will smith, but i know that he was given awful lines to work with, and when he had decent dialogue, he delivered pretty well. jai courtney's horrible acting was at least slightly hidden. joel kinnaman, though, had some very rough moments, even though for about 65% of the movie he was somewhere between passable and good. viola davis disappointed me, not because she was bad, but because she was only okay. jared leto, though, was a disgrace. his joker voice sounded like his mouth was full of spit, his laugh was just plain bad, and the way his scenes were shot and edited didn't do him any favors. margot robbie is a special case. i think she did well, but the problem was that everything around her was so bad, it just made her lines, acting, and character be judged sort of unfairly. i think that if the other aspects of the movie were good, then she'd shine a little more, but the overall low quality of the rest of the movie clouds our judgement of her performance and the character of harley quinn.the pacing of a lot of the scenes is also disjointed. i wouldn't say the movie is too fast paced, but it rushes through a lot of things it could slow down on.don't watch this movie. i thought i would, saying to myself that it couldn't be that bad. well, it really can. i don't understand people who say this is better that BvS. that movie is more boring and dreary with a few bright spots rather than just wholly a failure like this one is."
" Doesn't live up to the hype
",2018-03-07 00:00:00,4,"Suicide Squad has been highly anticipated for several years leading up to its release. There's a lot and nothing going on at seemingly the same time. The first 20 minutes of the film felt like it was written by an amateur and forgets the one basic tenant of filmmaking, show, don't tell. Every character is introduced via Amanda Waller's (Viola Davis) voice over telling the audience the who, what, when and why in vignette form, complete with it's own soundtrack moment. It was paint by the numbers and painful to sit through. Firstly put she was miscast and the lengthy introduction by her was awful.The film has decent visuals and is wonderful to look at but the story and overall plot were lacking. It was basic and generic and we have seen similar storylines before. Jared Leto as the Joker is more of a background supporting character, instead of a straight lead, as advertised in the trailers and his high billing. Suicide Squad isn't completely terrible, just disappointing considering its success and its hype leading up to it. Perhaps the film is better on multiple viewings?"
" A bit of trickery and a lot of lights
",2018-03-06 00:00:00,3,"I'm not happy to say that when I first saw this film, I thought I'd genuinely enjoyed it. With its neon colors and a soundtrack I actually still respect, it lured so many into the theater, only so they could walk out with synthetic smiles on their faces. It's loud, obnoxious, and generic all at the same time. Great job, Suicide Squad.
It seems to actively try to insult its audience's intelligence, and looking back, it really is a hard movie to recommend to anyone. Unless you for some reason accept DC as the god of movies, don't give this movie your time or money."
" I expected more but it was interesting...
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,6,"""Suicide Squad"" is an action fantasy movie in which we watch a team of the world's most dangerous supervillains, provide them with the most powerful weapons at the government's disposal, and send them off on a mission to defeat an enigmatic entity. The U.S. government let them free in order to win this enigmatic entity since they have nothing to lose if they will die. After some time they understand that they weren't picked to succeed in this mission but they were chosen for their skills and they also understand that their true mission is to save the world from the apocalypse.Despite all the bad reviews I have to say that I liked this movie but I expected much more from it. I also liked most of the soundtracks of it. Since I had high expectations from this movie and I read many reviews before I watched it, I have to admit that I was disappointed with it but I believe that I would be even more if I wasn't prepared for it. I liked the interpretations of Margot Robbie who played as Harley Quinn, Will Smith who played as Deadshot and Jay Hernandez who played as Diablo. In my opinion, the interpretation of Jared Leto who played as The Joker was poor and I expected more from him.Lastly, I believe that ""Suicide Squad"" is an average movie which due to its high promotion and advertisement made the people having very high expectations and of course they were let down by it. I recommend this movie to everyone to watch but you have to be prepared for not having high hopes for it."
" i don't, i don't even....
",2018-03-02 00:00:00,1,"This movie is a complete garbage fest, and it suffers from the same problems that batman v superman suffered, too much exposition for a shit payoff, the designs make me wanna tear my eye out, and i hate it"
" Suicide Squad
",2018-02-21 00:00:00,7,"It was a good movie, but not that much great action. The fighting scenes were awesome and the villains are portrayed well, but not that much interesting.So 7.5/10"
" The worst of the worst
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,3,"This movie had so much potential but ended up being a total letdown. I'm not basing my review on the sheer fact of disapointment, but on the movie in general. The story is bad, the villain is awful, the characters are written so lazy, and the tone is inconsistent. Some moments of the movie are really good though! the fight scenes in the mall - and the one between the antagonist (God) and Diablo, the bar scene (no, no - the uncut one), the backstory for Harley Quinn, and some of the joker parts. The editing seems to have left the film with a bit of controversies (to say it mildly), because the rest of the movie is either crap or poorly directed. The worst things about this movie is the flat characters, the cheesy dialogue, and the awkward character interactions. the good things about the movie are the few good scenes, the charming set of actors that keeps it somewhat interesting, and the effects that holds up to the standard of a superhero movie (I know it's antiheroes, but the writers didn't). Also the movie never slows enough down to being boring, but is still really bad."
" Total Crap
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,1,"I watched this a long time ago but I washed my brain with Tide-Pods to cleanse it from this movie.Watched random Youtube video and this was mentioned so I got here and write a review.I just gonna list the problems with this crap :
1. This is not a squad of bad guys. This is a squad of good guys pretending to be bad guys acting like good guys. 
2. Most of the squad are irrelevant, useless, and annoying. Fireman, Crocodiles, Boomerangman, Slipknot, nobody cares about these people.
3. The enemies are crap. Enchantress is crap, her minions are faceless unlimited boring crap.
4. Corny everything. When Harley said, ""Don't hurt my friends!"", I literally vomitted."
" This movie literally scarred me....
",2018-02-16 00:00:00,1,"I used to love super hero movies... Everything changed the day I walked into that movie theatre to watch what is undoubtedly the worst thing I've ever seen. I can't even call it a movie. Movies have plots... Movies are entertaining... Even bad ones get a wee little laugh for being so bad. This is even beyond that. The whole point of the film makes no sense... A room full of generals shoots down Waller's idea to set them up then, in a effort to convince them, she uses a witch to steal military secrets from Iran. This apparently proves enough cause to set up the squad, instead of just using the witch on her own to steal whatever secrets anybody wamts. The real jewel, this witch is seemingly under the control of whoever has her heart but not really because she just breaks free with ease when Waller falls asleep. Then surprise surprise, the squad this witch was supposed to be a part of ends up having to take her down. The coolest scene in the movie should've been deadshot busting the shite out of all those walking caviar blobs with cool camera angles following bullets as they split 4 things open at once, instead it's about 2 minutes of Will Smith standing N a car shadow boxing. Joker drives a Lambo and wears loads of bling. Completely wrong character motivation, and just like the film, that's enough about him. Too stupid (not funny) jokes, trying to rival Marvel. Would've been way better if it was gritty and dark like the trailers led us to believe. There's just so many terrible things. 1 star is too high. I'm permanently scarred. I've only been to the movies twice since and both of those times were in the last month. This movie is so bad it genuinely damaged my love of film. I can't even count Howard times I said ""What the fuck!?"" in the theatre. Just God forsaken tripe...."
" Hopefully a wakeup call for the DCEU's future.
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,2,"Suicide Squad is fundamentally one of those ""if done correctly"" stories. Even before you embark on the journey this movie takes you on, you ask yourself ""if the threat is so big, why not call any of the good guy superheroes in this universe?"" And the movie struggles to answer that - instead elects to brush the question to the side with a mindless suggestion that the world needs a line of defense in case Superman falls out of line. The band of characters we follow throughout the story are remarkably unlikable and a handful of them are given virtually nothing to do in the plot. If you subscribe to the logic of ""your movie is only as good as it's villain"" you would certainly be right in the case of this movie because the threat that looms over the movie spends a lot of the time bordering between ""immensely boring"" and ""logically ridiculous"".Suicide Squad also brings us the first live action film adaptation of ""The Joker"" since Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, and I don't think Jared Leto comes anywhere near matching the larger than life Joker portrayals we've seen anywhere in the past, quite possibly being the worst Joker we've ever seen in a movie. I don't want to write off Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley Quinn however, with a proper script and story to fit into I think she can do Quinn justice. I wouldn't recommend checking this one out, it will surely be a disappointing film."
" I walked out
",2018-01-30 00:00:00,1,"I tried to like. I really did. But with too many plot holes, predicatble chracters, poor chracter development, and cringey one liners, I had to leave. The only interesting thing about this movie is the costumes. The music was pandering way too much and seemed as though it was there just to try and elevate a scene that was ****. Batman, out of every superhero has the best rogue's gallery hands down. And this movie made me hate every single one. I never want to see another Zach Snyder film again. Why studios keep throwing money at him, I'll never know. It seems as if he's perfectly fine catering to cringey/edgey teens who only shop at hot topic and like abusive relationships. If you love DC at all, or even commics for that matter, do NOT see this movie. It will make you want to rip your hair out."
" ""The Dirty Dozen"" meets the DC Universe
",2018-01-27 00:00:00,4,"I never really had any interest in watching this film when it was first released, but having been blow away by Margot Robbie's performance in ""I, Tonya"" I wanted to see another of her films and unfortunately chose this one. There's a lot of potential with a story that has the ""worst of the worst"" super villains being called upon for a chance at redemption by agreeing to go on a suicide mission to save earth. Think ""The Dirty Dozen"" meets the DC Universe. Written and directed by David Ayer, I'd have loved to seen a hard edged, dark ""Training Day"" version of a superhero film, but what we end up with instead is a lightweight PG-13 superhero underdog story. For a film that want's to be dark, this film features a pretty likable group of super villains. This film also reminded me how thin the DC Universe is with heroes and villains outside of the Batman and Superman. Okay, Deadshot and Harley Quinn are legit DC Universe figures, but when you have to include El Diablo and Captain Boomerang, you know there's not a rich pool of characters to pull from (for the record, I do own every issue of the 1989 run of El Diablo). There's also a very unpleasant overuse of CGI that had the effect of distancing me from the action on screen. Give me the stripped down street-level action of Netflix's ""Daredevil"" any day. On the plus side for the film, Robbie is good as Harley Quinn, but she's really the only standout of the squad (unless you count Viola Davis as their tough boss, who is equally good and probably scarier than any of the super villains). Another plus is an occasionally retro soundtrack that I'm pretty sure was influenced by the much better ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" although this film's soundtrack falters when it dips into bland contemporary hip hop. You also get fight scenes choreographed by Richard Norton (a regular nemesis of Jackie Chan in his action films of the 80s and 90s), but much of hand-to-hand fight sequences are muted by the bombastic CGI, which is the big problem with this film. Batman and Superman films are better suited to ridiculously large scale set pieces and generally bombastic action, whereas this film should have been more of a gritty, nasty, punch-you-in-the-gut type of action film that was along the lines of ""Death Wish"" with super powers. Overall, ""Suicide Squad"" isn't a terrible movie, but it's an absolute missed opportunity."
" Worst Comic Book Movie Ever?
",2018-01-25 00:00:00,2,"This movie is pure garbage. After the disappointment brought on by Batman V Superman, it was quite evident that things were heading in the wrong direction for DC. Here, expectations were set at rock bottom, and even then, it failed to reach them. I can easily say that this is the most boring superhero movie around, at least of those that are part of current canons. After the first third of the movie, which is entirely introducing characters, it consists primarily of the Squad walking. The first part, with the exposition, wasn't that bad. It got dull after a while, but still could've been worse. What's worse is that the story is just plain dumb. Basically, after Superman's ""death"" in Batman V Superman, this officer named Amanda Waller (who is quite possible the most hateable character is this whole dang thing) recruits some of the most dangerous criminals in the world (some of which are shown being beaten by Batman and The Flash) to fill in his role. The idea was so heavily criticized, that even the Lego Batman Movie made fun of it. Anyway, this group of baddies needs to fight this sorceress named Enchantress. She was pretty cool for her first 2 minutes, then she got dull really fast. She's also got this brother named Incubus, who is just about the most generic movie villain, ever. He also looks like Volga from Hyrule Warriors. Perhaps the most glaringly wrong thing about this film is Jared Leto's portrayal of the Joker, which I think is a viable contender for worst book-to-screen portrayal of a character, in general. While Heath Ledger did set the bar pretty high, there wasn't enough of him here, and he felt like a mashup of other previous Jokers, with no consistency. It also has all this unnecessary sexualization, of characters both male and female. In some cases, notably Harley Quinn, we can expect that given the source material. But holy crap, I swear Harley's ass gets more screen time than the Joker. Some of the squad's members, namely Katana and Slipknot, are totally useless. All in all, this is easily the worst comic book movie in recent years. No matter how bad it is, we must never forget our deepest loss, brought on by this movie. R.I.P Slipknot. We'll never forget."
" my suicide squad review
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,9,I really love this movie and actually it is underrated
" Not Bad Comic Book Flick!
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,6,"Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto and Viola Davis star in this 2016 action film based on the DC Comics. Smith (Independence Day) plays assassin, Deadshot who longs to be with his daughter. Soon, he and other bad, but unique characters are recruited and assembled by the U.S. government to stop a deadly enchantress. Robbie plays Harley Quinn, a sexy, naughty woman, Leto plays The Joker, her lover, Davis plays CIA operative, Amanda Waller and Ben Affleck makes a brief appearance as Bruce Wayne/Batman.
This isn't bad, the cast is decent, but Robbie steals the film and there's neat effects. Give this a try at least once, especially if you like comics."
" A bad movie with very good parts... the 1970's special effects is not one of them
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,4,"This movie had such great potential that it is a shame that it falls so flat. First, the good. Floyd Lawton/Deadshot (Will Smith) has a story line that is actually compelling and interesting, one in which you want to know more about, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) is also a very well acted, entertaining and interesting character, and finally the most interesting, diverse, and entertaining character in the entire movie Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) a character that could perhaps carry a movie on her own.The most entertaining and interesting scenes come from when those characters are involved and you get a sense that if they were to tell an actual story it would be a great movie but it doesn't and of course the movie is not solely based on them.Unfortunately beyond those three characters you have the rest of the movie... where to begin.You have Boomerang who is a terrible choice for the Suicide Squad as he didn't or couldn't add much to the movie, just a dose of bad comedy. Then there's Diablo a character that they did spend time on special effects to make his fire powers look fanciful, but not much else, he isn't at all a compelling character or one that you are ever vested in. And then the throw away characters Slipknot, his entire inclusion is to show the lengths Waller would go to... but it is so absolutely poorly executed to make his inclusion laughable.And finally the terrible...The Joker is reduce to a tattooed thug instead megalomaniacal genius, one word. Awful.Killer Croc an utterly terrifying character in the DC universe is an utter joke in this movie used for comic relief. He looks like a normal guy in a poorly designed Halloween costume. The Flash TV show also set in the DC universe had a similar character named King Shark, they created him in CGI to show off his imposing stature and terrifying nature, but here in a big budget movie they painted a guy green, like the 1970's Hulk, with a big head and skinny arms, this is the worst of the worse.And this is all culminated by the fact that the main antagonist of the film in truth is something the Suicide Squad would not be capable of handling, but shoehorned in to try an make an entertaining premise, this instead makes the entire movie feel false and uninteresting and in the end just makes for very bad storytelling.With the way the ""enemy"" is handled you wouldn't even have needed any type of ""suicide squad"", just the National Guard or someone like that, but they obviously didn't know who to write or create and interesting antagonist or story and no matter what good points you have, without that you have nothing.At this point, they are stuck with the foundation they've built so there is little hope for any sequels but perhaps in the future they will focus on the good points and try to create more interesting stories, for now Suicide Squad is a movie you can pass on for something more watchable."
" Nothing to see here, move along.
",2018-01-09 00:00:00,1,"It's kind of rare to see a film that fails on every level, but Suicide Squad manages. It fails as an action movie by having the Power Rangers Putty Patrol as the most frequent antagonists. Most fight scenes are shot in the laziest way possible, and combined with the film's pacing you get bored of the action very quickly. The premise (a group of supervillains forced to work together as a black ops team for the US government) is completely squandered by having the main characters have little to no internal or external conflict. They also only ever fight and kill nondescript CG nothings, so there's no point to them being ""villainous"". The plot takes forever to get going, with about 3-4 scenes of Viola Davis telling people they need to form the squad in the first place. We're also treated to Jared Leto's joker, which is just awful in every way and adds nothing to the story, Deadshot's daughter that nobody could possibly care about, Captain Boomerang and Harley Quin who both have jokes that just fall completely flat, and Killer Croc and El Diablo, both of whom seem to exist for slightly to very racist dialogue. Oh, and Katana, who does nothing and is around for no reason, comes in out of nowhere, and who you'll forget about every time she's off screen.The plot is a complete mess, with the overall conflict starting because of Viola Davis starting the Suicide Squad to begin with. The Enchantress, arguably the main antagonist, is another supervillain that just wants to destroy the world for no reason. 
 She has a brother with 2 lines or so that is just a big CG monster that doesn't really do anything but kill Diablo I guess. The main enemies the puttys, are so non-threatening as to be a joke.Oh, also this movie is just really offensive in general. Mental illness is a joke, spousal abuse is a joke, sexual abuse is a joke, people really like to call the only hispanic character ""homeboy"", and the word ""bitch"" is thrown around like nobody's business. So not only is this film a chore at two and a half hours, it's an offensive chore. Don't watch it. Don't watch its sequel, or its spin-offs, or anything else from this crap production crew or David Ayer."
" Spectacular
",2018-01-08 00:00:00,7,"I liked this movie especially the actors , will smith and margot robbie , really had fun watching it . It has a good level of humour and margot robbie was awesome as harley quinn"
" BEST MOVIE EVER!!
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,10,I love this movie and would totally recommend! DC really hit the nail on the head with casting on this one. The thematic music visuals were amazing. Can't wait for Suicide Squad 2!!
" Not a bad comic book movie
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Suicide Squad' is on par with 'Batman v Superman' (if you didn't mind that, you won't mind this and if you hated that, you probably won't like this either) and the film acts as its sequel and a stop-gap until 'Justice League' comes out next year. It's also DC trying to compete with Marvel's 'Deadpool' which was MA and about an antihero who kills people - although this is only rated M. Still, a few people are killed and there's plenty of violence, but it probably has more in common with 'Ghostbusters' than 'Deadpool'.The film does a great job of introducing the characters in the first 20min, with everyone getting their own song and ""profile"", and each of them gets a bit of backstory as the film progresses - Deadshot (Smith, an assassin), Harley Quinn (Robbie, Joker's girlfriend, in those amazing ""pants""), Joker (Leto, with his metal teeth making him sound a little like Ledger), Boomerang (Courtney, doing his best Tom Hardy in 'The Revenant' impression), Diablo (Hernandez, pretty much Human Torch), Killer Croc (Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Enchantress (Delevingene, a witch). There should've been more of how Batman (Affleck) put them all in prison, but he only gets 2min screentime, and the Joker not much more - obviously setting up a Joker v Batman film somewhere down the line. Waller (Davis) is the true villain and she manipulates well to get this ""team"" together and ""controlled"" by Flag (Kinnaman) to go on a rescue mission, that soon turns into a suicide mission.The main issue is the ""ultimate"" bad guy is one of them - Enchantress. She creates a swirling vortex-thing that we've seen a million times and they have to stop her. The problem is the same for all superhero films - why not call in the rest of the heroes? In this case, where are Batman, Wonder Woman and The Flash? The tone is sometimes light and funny, but then gloomy and ""we're still the bad guys and are still probably going to die"" the next. It doesn't ruin the film, but sometimes makes it hard to read. The soundtrack is great throughout and often keeps the tone fun. The action and fight scenes are done well, but the film probably outstays it's welcome by 10min. No one, even Smith, hogs too much screentime and it definitely doesn't always work, but is a mostly fun ride."
" Lacked Importance
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,5,"To start positive the actors were great but their characters weren't, the characters had potential but they took so little time into introducing characters and just went jumping straight into action, which is all the story is, its just ""let's get to the bad guy, shoot some things and maybe blow something up"" it's kind of a Michael Bay movie but with just a little bit less sexual references. But yes the lack of plot and character development was definitely the movies downfall."
" DIRTY (half) DOZEN....
",2017-12-31 00:00:00,1,"There is NOTHING original about this film. The writer/director took the plot from THE DIRTY DOZEN and superhero-ed it up. 2 dimensional plot - 2 dimensional acting - 2 dimensional heroes - 2 dimensional dialogue - 2 dimensional directing - 2 dimensional villains -2 dimensional movie experience... it would be ironic if this film was presented in 3D, wouldn't it? 
This film used EVERY filmmaking beat-a-dead-horse cliche' in the book. The writer also used the formulaic Hollywood check list and used almost every one of them. BORING - BORING - BORING!
The ""only"" thing that kept my interest was seeing how many shots Margot Robbie was seen walking away from CAMERA in her short-shorts and trying to spot which Toronto locations I could identify in the film. She is a fine actress and obviously had fun making the film. I also like Jared but try as he might, nothing can now come close to Heath's portrayal of the Joker. He set the standard...forever. I don't even want to get into Mr. Smith's portrayal...he continues to play by the Hollywood A-list actor ego handbook. Boring..."
" OMG What was this?
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,1,"This was probably the worst super hero film ever made.
The story was every where but in the film, i don't know if it was me but i didn't even see a story just a put together mess of ok acting and CGI,
DC Comic's needs to really rethink the film industry choices, this was obviously a big push against Marvel but really a step too far where nothing made sense."
" Eurgh.
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,1,"Why can't DC get there shit together? To think the hack director said ""fuck marvel"" after the premiere. Really? After you reshot the movie to try and make it more like GOTG?The casting is awful, The jokes are the worst - if you can't write jokes then don't write jokes. Not everything has to be funny. The script and story was so predictable! DC are hiring this dick again? At least they had the good sense to get rid of Zack Snyder. Just don't bother it's not even bad in a good way. It's just a giant cringe fest."
" One of the few movies i've seen in my life that actually made me angry
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,2,"Acting:
Margot Robbie: defenitely the best part about this movie, seems to have the most fun.
Will Smith: being will smith. Occasionally funny.
Joel Kinnaman: Can't act really well. Relationship with June Moon about the only emotional arc i was invested in.
VIola Davis: Bland en aggresively unlikable
Jared Leto: an amazing commited performance is hidden in there somewhere. Because of all the editorial butchering, it's not that good.
Jai Courtney: Best performance i've seen from him in his career. Which isn't saying much.
Cara Delavigne: Never liked this actress to begin with. As a villain, she is laughable. As an actress, she is okay.Cinematography: Everything looks dark and gloomy, like it's part of a garbage bin. The scenes that are meant to be emotional are okay.Direction: Awful. The actor's don't strike me as real people because of how they say these lines, and the emotional cores feel corny and unintentionally funny.Plot: Mildly entertaining, but nonsensical.Editing: Transition between scenes is bad. No surprise when the trailer guys edited this thing.Music: At first just a pile of random obnoxious pop songs, and after that a score that is not noticable in any way.Action: explosive and kinetic, but also very hard to follow, and there is no tension because of the amount of unlikable characters.VFX: Lazy most of the time, and the extensive cgi for incubus and the witch looks bad.Tone: Very dark and gloomy and aggressively trying to be funny at the same time. It doesn't work.Overall: A mess from start to finish, with some little things that stand out."
" Seen Avengers?
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,3,"If you have seen Avengers you have seen Suicide Squad. Same plot, same action, just a little different story line. At times difficult to follow, Joker comes and goes and really plays no real part in this movie but character was huge on the promos. Batman character was extremely limited and could of been written to play a much bigger role. Honestly the movie only deserves 2 stars but Harley Quinn's character and beauty adds a star all on her own."
" One word.. 'Awful'
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,1,"This movie is probably the worst movie created in 2016, due to the terrible character choices in this film, i am very confused as to how it got a 6.1 though?"
" Schlechter Film
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,3,Das einzige Gute in dem Film sind die Figuren Harley Quinn und EL Diablo.
" Margot Robbie Steals The Movie
",2017-12-20 00:00:00,7,"Suicide Squad (2016) Plot In A Paragraph: A secret government agency recruits some of the most dangerous incarcerated super-villains to form a defensive task force. Their first mission: save the world from the apocalypse.This was not as bad as I remembered. I'll say this right off the bat, Margot Robbie not only, totally steals this movie, she stops it from being outright awful. I'd watch a solo movie with Robbie as Harley Quinn any day.The first 20 minutes were decent, as was the last 20 minutes. It's what is in between that's the problem. Smith was ok as Deadshot, but his performance was a bit too Will Smith for me. I thought Leto's Joker showed promise for future movies and for the first time ever, I did not hate Jai Courtney. I really enjoyed the rock soundtrack too.Suicide Squad became Will Smith's highest grossing domestic movie. Grossing $325 million at the box office to end the year, the 9th highest grossing movie of 2016."
" Likeable
",2017-12-15 00:00:00,9,"This movie has many redeeming qualities. Granted I did not have big expectations since the reviews were bad and I saw it at home. However, I was pleasantly surprised with its likability. Especially Margot Robbie, she did a great job creating an off stereo typical female role!I also have to give a lot of credit to the Music Supervisors; they really added a lot of genius to this movie. Much the way the soundtrack in Guardians of the Galaxy worked. The end was not great but I enjoyed many parts of this and respect the effort it took to make a big looking movie like this."
" Great characters, but terrible plot and everything else is just bad
",2017-12-13 00:00:00,2,"Started out this movie with the thoughts of it being pretty good, just because the actor line up was pretty good, but left the movie wanting to kill myself just because of the terrible plot, terrible directing, and just terrible everything. Warner Bros kind of destroyed the DC we loved from The Dark Knight trilogy and instead rebooted and gave us this. Warner Bros, just stop. Get rid of Zach Snyder and reboot again and maybe this time you can get it right like Christopher Nolan did with The Dark Knight. Please, just what ever you do...don't watch this. It isn't worth it."
" Disappointment Squad
",2017-12-13 00:00:00,4,"I was looking forward to watch this movie, but after watching i was disappointment..The story is to lame and has been done a thousand times realy? ....
SO much talented actors in this movie and they come up this, a bunch of autistic irritating villians (superhero's) whom need to destroy an evil bitch.Thats the main story realy.. As all 'superhero' movie's1 - a bad guy who wants to destroy the world (again)
2 - a superhero (team)
3 - big fight
4 - the world has been saved again.Well i'm done with this kind of fu-**cking shit!If u want too see a great movie from 2016, watch 'passengers'"
" Quick summary
",2017-12-09 00:00:00,5,"so if you can't be asked to spend 5 minutes reading a review, here is a quick summaryGreat actors, Mediocre action scenes, The plot is so damn lack luster, they could've done so much more than what it isI'd say if you have a lot of time on your hands then you should watch it, it isn't that bad. But if you're very picky with movies like me, I you shouldn't see it"
" Worse than expected
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,4,"Reviewers here keep saying it's not as bad as you heard. They're right - it's worse! Sadly, as long as these dire 'super hero' movies keep getting punters into the cinemas and making profits, the producers will keep churning them out.The effects here are actually better and more consistent than both Spiderman Homecoming and Wonderwomen, but the characters and writing is so below par, it makes for a far worse experience.Please producers, look at 'Logan' and see what it did right and why people rate it so highly. A decent script and characters that had depth, coupled with excellent effects that complemented the story rather than trying to usurp it."
" Just the worst - writing, plot, everything
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,1,"I am losing faith in the DC movie attempts. This is by far the worst of the lot, which just makes no sense. The cast was great, they had some of the best characters, and then did nothing with them. Most characters only got a few minutes to set up their backstory, so the character development was basically non-existent. Because of this, the characters were shallow, lacked reasoning for their motivations, and fell flat. One character was literally introduced, and quickly killed, simply to demonstrate the bombs planted in the villains. Such a cheap addition. The dialogue was stilted and awkward, and if I hear Will Smith say, ""We're the bad guys,"" one more time, I'm going to scream. The only character who I felt any sympathy with was El Diablo, and he barely did anything the entire movie. Jared Leto was also a terrible choice to play the Joker, but not as bad as Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, but that's another story. These actors were wasted. The entirety of the plot was such a giant mess. If Waller hadn't started the moronic plan to gather these villains, none of the events in the movie would have happened. For a character we are led to believe is so ruthless and smart, she's really a complete idiot. She's more a person who *thinks* she's smart than an actual smart person. I was so disappointed by this movie. There was such potential in the original idea, yet every step after that was taken down a horrible path. I will not be watching the sequel."
" ""Puddin'!""
",2017-11-28 00:00:00,4,"In the aftermath of the events played out in Batman v Superman, some in the government are concerned about handling the next meta-human crises the world might face. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) puts together a team of super criminals, each with their own unique power/talents to deal with such a threat. The newly formed Suicide Squad is called in to action almost immediately when one of Waller's recruits turns and threatens to destroy the world. When I first caught wind of Suicide Squad, I was excited. My excitement started to wane as I read more and more about the movie. By the time it hit theaters and I read the initial reviews, I decided to wait to watch it. I finally sat down with it last night. And while it's not as bad as some would have you believe (I mean a 1/10 is an absolutely ridiculous rating for this movie), overall, it's a bloated mess of a film. The end result is a mostly unentertaining and quite often boring film. A lot of the problems with Suicide Squad could have been remedied with some judicious editing, a more streamlined cast, and baddies with better defined purpose. Editing - There are many useless moments in the film that seem to exist only to extend the film's ridiculously long runtime. For example (and I could cite dozens), right out of the gate, Waller is involved in two separate meetings to discuss the possibility of forming the Suicide Squad. Why not one? Why did we need to see her make her case twice? Totally unnecessary. Cast - The cast is far too large. Some of the characters are unnecessary to the film. Why include them? The Suicide Squad could have easily consisted of Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and El Diablo. Characters like Captain Boomerang, Katana, Slipknot (why bother with him in the first place), Killer Croc and even Joker (yes, even Joker), could have been eliminated without changing a whole lot of the film. All these characters only serve to take up screen time, confuse the issue, and extend the film's runtime. I'm thankful they weren't all given the same detailed backstories like Deadshot and Harley - otherwise, this would have been a 3+ hour movie.Baddies - The baddies, Enchantress and her brother, are so poorly defined that I still have no idea what they were up to. I know they were trying to destroy the world, but why? What was their endgame? Maybe it's explained, but if it is, it's not explained very well. How about a baddie with a real plan? If you really want Joker in the movie, make him the baddie. The conflict Harley would have been forced to go through would have made for a better movie than this.Those are my three main points, but there are more I could get into if I wanted, like: bad CGI, some ridiculous dialogue, the gooey minions that reminded me of a Power Ranger's villain (and were about as threatening), and a soundtrack that, though it includes some great songs, got annoying real quick. All of these negatives overshadow any fun that might have been in the script and the solid performances from Viola Davis, Margo Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, and Jay Hernandez. In the end, I consider Suicide Squad a wasted opportunity for DC to bring in some new fans. The original idea and the trailers promised so much more than was actually delivered. I'm rating this one a very disappointing, but generous, 4/10."
" Enjoyable
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,7,"All these bad reviews! I like this movie. Just let go and enjoy it! Yes, some of the characters are underdeveloped and unbelievable but the movie itself is enjoyable if you just sit back, relax, and enjoy it. Lots of action, sometimes hard to follow, but it flows and is funny at times."
" Just above Halle Berry's Catwoman
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,4,"Seriously, I would have been so mad if I wasted money paying to see this film in the theaters. First off, Jared Leto's ""Joker"" is very, very pathetic. The look, demeanor, simply atrocious, and the attempt at Heath Ledger's ""Joker-talk"" was cringe worthy. I pray God has mercy on his soul.Will Smith and Margot Robbie actually do decent jobs with their characters, even though Robbie's ""Punk Harley"" suffered from being chained to Leto's Joker.Plot wise...world domination...the end. Seriously, the plan for a movie villain does not have to always be world domination. It is also tiring to see bright giant beams channeling another dimension, while at the same time, leveling the Earth, for the 1 Billionth time.This film did not feel connected in any way to the DCU, regardless of the fact Batman, Flash, Amanda Wheeler, and talks of Superman are featured. It was almost like ""just because you said it...does not make it true!"""

" Another good DC Movie
",2017-11-19 00:00:00,10,"I watched Suicide Squad with my friends and the both of us said that this was a good movie. I really don't know why people are hating on this movie including some critics but what they need to do is shut up and appreciate it. The good things about the movie was the cast, characters, story, soundtrack, humor scenes, and fight scene. For the bad things there is really nothing bad about the movie"
" Dismal Crap.
",2017-11-19 00:00:00,3,"As much as I prefer the DC universe over Marvel, those behind the movies seem unable to replicate the ingenuity and entertainment level of superhero competitors Marvel. Pretty much every movie DC have produced since the turn of the millennium has been disappointing (and yes, I do include Nolan's vastly over-rated Batman trilogy in that statement).Suicide Squad is no exception a chaotic mess of a movie that lingers in the mind for about as long as it takes the Flash to nip to the shops and back. Writer/director David Ayer clearly hopes that the novelty of a team of super-villains will be enough to carry the movie, but he's wrong: Suicide Squad is desperately in need of a creative driving force who is more concerned with telling a decent story than showcasing his cool characters and blowing his budget on an arsenal of trendy graphics and expensive CGI special effects.As far as the cast are concerned, Will Smith is adequate as Deadshot, the world's greatest hit-man, Margot Robbie's butt is great as Harley Quinn's butt, and Karen Fukuhara as Katana ably fulfils the token Asian hottie role for the overseas market, but everyone else is bland and instantly forgettable, including Jared Leto as the worst incarnation of the Joker to ever grace the silver screen. And whoever thought that the world's ugliest supermodel, Cara Delevingne, would make for an imposing villainess needs their head checked: she's dreadful."
" What's wrong with people!!!
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,8,"It's a real good movie, better than BvS... The direction is good, no boring moments unlike BvS. All characters did justice to their roles. Especially Dead shot and Harley Quinn nailed it. May be one or two plot holes but hey, anything which is based on comics can go sideways.The story is gripping from the first scene, all characters have backstory which was not dragged. Humour has been placed well and that keeps us going.One thing though, joker could have been a better selection. Of course no one can pull Heath Ledger but if anyone could then its Jim Carrey.Well it was hell lot entertaining than BvS."
" An ""okay"" movie entry into the DCEU
",2017-11-17 00:00:00,6,"Overall, I do like the DCEU thus far, but they really need to work on their editing and CGI.This movie is fun and nothing amazing, but it is entertaining. The best parts for me were the joker and harley scenes. The villain was a problem. To be honest, that is another problem that the DCEU needs to work out.One positive thing that I will say about this movie is that the characters are great. They mesh together really well and have depth. I really liked the Batman cameo. The main negatives of this film are the editing, villain, and CGI. If all three of these items had been changed, this movie would probably be great instead of ""okay.""I guess we can say that the movie set out what it intended to do and that is to entertain, so for that, I am pleased."
" A problematic yet entertaining supervillain assemble feature
",2017-11-13 00:00:00,7,"Good:Unique take on the superhero genre featuring a team-up of DC supervillains. Most of the cast portrayed their characters very well including Deadshot, Harley Quinn and Amanda Waller. The whole Suicide Squad team do have great chemistry.Bad:Poorly written story. Enchantress is a generic and unsuitable villain. Joker is underutilized and overacted. Overused soundtrack and some bad editing."
" 1/2 of a good movie and now an extended version? No thanks!
",2017-11-10 00:00:00,6,"Starts out great and then turns into an over-extended parody of itself that plays more like a video game than a movie. Killer Broccoli Zombies on the loose! I only cared for a few of the so-called meta-humans. The women steal-the-show for the most part but project head Amanda Waller ""terminated"" her entire staff for almost no reason. That's just cruel. The other females are the Enchantress/June Moore, Zoe, and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. She's lookin' good wearing shrunken spanky pants and a tiny t-shirt. She can take over for Wonder Women or Supergirl if they ever get out-of-shape. Most of the characters are unlikable and only a few, such as Deadshot (Will Smith), The Croc, and El Diablio, really stand out. Sick, cold-blooded killers without any remorse for their deadly sins. Why is it called the Suicide Squad? Because these awful misfits are given a suicide assignment (to kill the witch) in exchange for time-off on their lifetime prison sentences. Of course the witch wants to rule the world. What's so wonderful about Planet Earth, anyway? Like most ""stupid-hero"" flicks, none of the important people die. The Joker and Waller live on in spite of going down in flames in aircraft. Homage to ""Ghostbusters I"", as Enchantress dies after having her heart cut out and June Moore emerges unscathed. The Joker (Jared Leto) saves the squad. Two hours of messy mass confusion that should be 90 minutes. A real ""super"" movie: Super violent and Super-stupid."
" It felt like one big trailer
",2017-11-04 00:00:00,3,"This movie is absolutely terrible. It has some redeeming qualities like um.... Will Smith as Deadshot is good compared to the rest of the cast. The editing is the some of the worst I have EVER seen. The editing especially with the character intros makes it feel like a trailer and it's extremely annoying. The story is f***ing stupid with so many things that will just make you go "" What the **** were they thinking? "". The soundtrack is also horrendous with contributions from such great artists as... Wiz Khalifa,Imagine Dragons, Skrillex, Big Ross, and many more! The characters are also EXTREMELY CRINGY with Harley Quinn having lines that made me physically cringe. Overall this movie is dog**** and the only reason I'm giving it a 3 is because "" Fortunate Son "" is in the movie.3/10"
" Great cast but poorly executed
",2017-10-31 00:00:00,3,"Firstly, let me say that this film is by no means bad. I'm not saying this is a good film either because, frankly, it isn't. It suffers from many of the same problems as Batman vs Superman. It has a weak plot with many holes in it. The film spends nearly half the time introducing its characters, yet I still found myself not caring whether they lived or died. There was no real threat for our 'heroes' as the stakes really weren't either high enough, or weren't enphasised enough. The CGI was terrible, with the enchantress' goons looking appalling. The story was some what cliché with them falling apart and deadshot doing his speech in the bar. Diablo also followed the mold eventually sacrificing himself. The enchantress reminded me more of someone from a strip club rather than a world threatening villain. Amanda Waller was a great addition to the DC universe, however even her character needed more development and work. Unfortunately, the joker wasn't the main villain as, and while this may be controversial, I found Jaret Leno's performance spell-binding. His take on the joker was great but the story was so poor that he could have been taken out and it would have ended with the same product. Most of the team members in the film would need an entire film to get their back story. Screen time was solely aimed towards Deadshot and Harley Quinn with them taking over at least 70% of the film. While Deadshot was not the ruthless assassin we all hoped for, he was acted brilliantly by will smith and DC really got the look they were going for. Margot Robbie was another example of great casting. She played a great Harley Quinn who was obsessed with the Joker and showed psychopathic tendencies throughout. Finally I want to congratulate Leno on his portrayal of the joker as if you watch all the deleted scenes, you see a lot more of him."
" decent follow-up Joker to Ledger's, otherwise ""ugh""
",2017-10-30 00:00:00,1,"i simply cannot stress this enough: the only worthwhile part of this movie is Jared Leto's Joker and Harley Quinn; honestly the rest of this cast/characters are simply unenjoyable tropes and quite forgettable. in fact, one of them we weren't properly introduced to and he expired immediately following the initiation of the first mission. the plot does not even bother to adhere to its own logic, in the character ""the witch"". every plot development or ""twist"" had me groaning, and quite honestly a further in- depth analytical review is so unwarranted because i have a life. thank you for reading, and don't bother watching unless you are interested in seeing 10 interspersed minutes of the Joker & Harley Quinn"
" Complete Disaster
",2017-10-30 00:00:00,1,"Suicide Squad might be the worst movie I've ever seen, I've watched countless bad movies, anything from The Room to the Neil Breen collection. But Suicide Squad is so far away from the ""so bad it's good"" genre that it actually becomes borderline embarrassing, and I don't even want to imagine what it was like to watch this in a cinema. I think my main issue with Suicide Squad is something that Marvel has tried to tackle a lot lately with its cinematic universe, and it's these weird, unfunny one-liners that just seem to appear out of nowhere, they don't fit with the current mood of the scene at all, and if you're over the age of 15 then these most likely just make you uncomfortable. Suicide Squad is just riddled with these dreadful little jokes and comments from the characters. The relationship between Harley Quinn and The Joker is a complete disaster. instead of going with the actual case that Harley Quinn is a victim of Stockholm syndrome, they are now just two uninteresting maniacs that are in love, news flash; THIS HAS BEEN DONE SO MANY TIMES BEFORE BUT WITH BETTER WRITERS. A lot of people are saying that Diablo is the best character in the movie, but I completely disagree, Diablo in this movie is what I like to call a ""nothing-character"" Characters like Darth Maul who say and do cool stuff, but the writing is so absurd that they ultimately become uninteresting and forgettable. Why does Killer Croc look like an out of shape wrestler?In conclusion this movie is just an embarrassing disaster, and the absolute worst of the DC cinematic universe."
" Not really sure about all the hate...
",2017-10-25 00:00:00,8,"I'm not quiet sure about all the hate aimed towards this movie.It was a ""mediocre"" movie, with ""high-end"" actors, some great music, scenes, there was close to no gore, cute happy ending, all You could want from a simple shallow movie, all of the Marvels/DC's are in the end.I enjoyed the movie, I can show it to my family too, because there was no excess blood and/or gore, I really enjoyed myself."
" We're the bad guys. It's what we do.

She puts together a group of criminals, who dubbed themselves ""Suicide Squad"" to take care of any meta-human problem should some superhero decide to go rogue.The first part of the film introduces all the characters with appropriate swagger music. Then a big fight happens at Midway City, something you would expect to be Chicago, but filmed in Toronto. Jared Leto who plays the Joker in this feature is slated to continue the role in the upcoming ""Justice League.""

" Ruined by Studio Interferences and a lack of clear direction.
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,2,"I know my rating seems pretty harsh, and people do like this film. To me this films is bad, pretty bad, to the point where I was bored. This is a movie that tries to be fun, to make it seem better than Batman V Superman, but it clearly clashes with the tone it had before. I had a feeling that David Ayers, a fantastic director, tried to make this film similar to End of Days or Fury where it was occupied by great characters and solid action but overall built on these characters. However, the studio decided, hey, how about adding the most generic villain possible when a terrorist or the Joker (who is barely in this film as you might have guessed) would have been much better. There are definitely plot holes, to be expected, but some of them are too major to ignore. The whole Marvel scenario where the villain is destroying the city and the Avengers aren't helping is usually an idea that works because not only do they give proper reasons, in the universe it makes sense because of the amount of villains. No one quite understands the DC universe yet, and it is inferred that apocalyptic events don't happen to much, so I would imagine for example the Flash would try to stop the villain. However the writers decided the best excuse they could make as to why they didn't alert the superheroes is because ""they could turn on the citizens at any given point"". You've heard the criticism before, but why it bugs me so much is that there is hole scene devoted to it, a scene that tries to be stylized with in your face techniques that I am sure the studio put in after realizing the film wasn't ""fun"" enough. Now some will agree with me that there was a lot of meddling behind the scene but many say the fun action scenes and memorable characters make the film good. I feel like I watched a different movie, because many of the characters are terrible. The only three I liked where Killer Croc, Captain Boomerang (hopefully Jai Courtney has more good performances like this) and Harley Quinn. It is definitely strange why these three where in the film, but I can understand because they were by far the best characters, however excluding Harley Quinn they have almost zero development. The others where too forgettable, but I feel like for example the fire guy was going to be developed, but then the studio feared there wasn't enough action or Joker scenes. Every other character remains generic or just bad to me. Some liked Will Smith as Deadshot, but there are a couple of things that pull me back from liking him. 1. He feels like he his sleeping during half the film, not at his full potential 2. He is not at all like Deadshot, which I wouldn't mind too much if Deadshot wasn't such an interesting and great villain. I thought Jared Leto wasn't a good Joker, but to be fair there was far too little of him to tell. Honestly if they re-shot the film I would opt for less Joker and more character development. The action in the movie is way, way too bland. All it consist of is shoot enemy made of basically goo, turn to ash and rinse, repeat. There never feels like there is any stakes, and the dark look of the city never adds to the feeling of ""fun"" and just contrasts it. More bar scenes would make the film more bearable and entertaining, because some characters would work better explored. Finally the soundtrack is obnoxious, it never feels like it works for the moment, and it just feels like the studio trying to enforce a style that conflicts with the rest of the film. David Ayres wanted a character film with some action, but instead its got to be a Guardians of the Galaxy rip off, and the tones never blend together. Instead of being something unique suicide squad feels like a mish mash of clichés. It tries to tell you its unique, but never goes the full mile. Some characters are interesting enough and sometimes I like how it is shot, but for the most part this film is a mess, and by far the DCEU's worst film to date."
" Honestly, it's really bad
",2017-10-18 00:00:00,2,First for the good: I do like Will Smith's performance in this movie. That is something that was able to hold up. Everything else pretty much is awful. There is no character development. None of the characters have any good acting besides Smith. The plot is just flat out stupid and there was nothing really all that great about the plot of this movie at all. The special effects are bland and annoying and the whole thing just falls down and falls flat every single time. I just dislike this movie the more time that passes by.
" Very good continuation
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,9,"I was expecting a stupid comedy with a meaningless plot, but the film was very interesting for me. I enjoyed watching until the end and not only thanks to famous actors and good special effects, but because the plot was interesting and this film was a direct continuation of ""Batman vs Superman"". Although I didn't know about this before watching since I did not see the trailer."
" Dull yet random, cheesy, predictable
",2017-10-11 00:00:00,4,"Plot: government sends out common criminals to hunt down a powerful supernatural force.Just waiting for the Joker to show up most of the time, and when he does it's kinda disappointing.Again, this is another movie with too many characters that haven't been fleshed out enough to give a crap about them. Yeah you see Deadshoot and Harley's pasts but what about everyone else? They just kinda quickly gloss over them like an athletes stats card.Wouldn't be surprised if most of this movie's budget was based on music and makeup. A lot of good hits but man did they feel cluttered throughout the movie. And Killer Croc may have scored this movie an Oscar, but it still just looks like a guy with a lot of makeup.Overall: weak story, mild characters, great music, typical hero ending making it predictable."
" Somewhere between fine and failure
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,4,"""Suicide Squad"" is an American movie from 2016 and actually among the biggest commercial successes from last year if we look at box office revenues. Still I have a feeling they may have expected more and we will see if it was still enough for them to make a sequel at some point. Writer and director is David Ayer and he had some big Hollywood names in his cast here like Will Smith, recent Oscar winners Viola Davis and Jared Leto as well as up-and-comers Margot Robbie and Cara Delevingne. And as the film also falls into the superhero genre, even if super villain genre would be more accurate, it was somehow guaranteed a crowd magnet. Critics reception, however wasn't great at all, and the film is mentioned by many as the biggest disappointment of the year, which I do not agree with at all as it really isn't that bad. This did not keep the Oscars though from giving it an Academy Award and yes makeup and hair-styling are really among the not too many strengths this film had. The characters' looks, also during the long introduction, early on are definitely something that elevated the mediocre and frequently very generic material. I am referring here to the father-daughter story, the fire villain's fear from causing destruction and other story lines too. They never become as emotional, let alone memorable, as they were intended too.And then there is Harley Quinn, maybe the film's most memorable character, but I also think that had more to do with the physical side than with the way Robbie played her. Admittedly, I did not find Robbie as bad or forgettable as she was in other roles, so maybe she was just a good casting decision. Still the way they used her character as a trigger for comedy looking at how insane she was did get repetitive quickly. Same goes for the ways in which Viola Davis was treated by all the villains like such a respectable, bad-ass character with so much authority that it was fairly cringeworthy. Besides, the ways in which the film tried to go for comedy like a villain equivalent to Guardians of the Galaxy was rarely successful at all and felt pretty forced most of the time. It's probably just not Ayer's genre. So going for a full gritty and dark approach would have been the better solution.Finally, a couple words on Leto's Joker. I think he is a talented actor and the character is really epic, but somehow it wasn't working out at all. I would not blame the makeup, but something didn't feel right there. I am saying this as somebody who is not a Ledger fanboy at all, but actually preferred Nicholson's take on the character I think. Let's hope Leto is back to his best with future projects (like the Blade Runner sequel) as he is too talented to appear in so few films only like he did for a while when he focused on his singing career. Here we have a really long film at easily over 2 hours, which is not too surprising for the genre, but sadly the quality is not on par with the quantity. It is maybe worth seeing for the occasional entertainment factor and as a pointless fun film overall, but depth and creativity are almost non-existent here. You won't find anything in here you haven't seen before already and frequently better. That's why I give the final outcome a thumbs-down and even if it was a close call, I don't recommend the watch."
" Everything Wrong
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,1,"Everything Wrong, the script wasn't really good, the villain and the premise are really unconnected. Confusing. And the joker is strange, like it's not joker, it's just gangster who cosplay as joker.I think Harley Quinn character is not fit for DCEU, Margot Robbie and Jared Leto is great actor but this movie really far from expectation.Sorry for WB"
" As Alfred would put it: 'Ooooo, how to best describe it??'
",2017-09-28 00:00:00,6,"Essentially, half this movie is filled with flashbacks, outlining each character's purpose in the story as well as providing a connected relationship with the characters. This movie seems to be dedicated to flashbacks which mostly focuses on Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie, connected with The Joker played by Jared Leto and Deadshot played by Will Smith. The others seem to be brief mostly to keep the group as a whole at bay.I'm in two minds about the layout of this film. This method can be seen as a good way to portray each character's origin story which means this film's purpose was to focus on each the character's biography to lead up to a much important sequel such as the Justice League or perhaps making a sequel to Suicide Squad which seems possible. Many films do that these days, they take there time to dive deeper into the story, separating them into chapters which is the best way to get the point across.Honestly with the performance of Harley Quinn and Deadshot in the picture was the highlight of this movie. I think because of the mix reviews of Batman vs Superman, the production team panicked and added random elements to the move to make it more lively, but they did take the time think it through. They just simply but popular songs together in separate sequences which didn't always mesh with the film.I think the trailer provided a false advertising story. The trailer made it seem like it was the Suicide Squad against The Joker, but there's nothing like that in the movie. I feel like the Joker was present as a supporting act for the Harley Quinn's character in order to create awareness, which makes sense even though Margot Robbie's performance was impressive on her own.However, I feel somewhere in this movie has something good coming from it but it's just hidden and formed into a core surrounded by a mesh of different stories all force into one, making it even more difficult to point out exactly where the good is coming from.Overall, this movie seemed to have clever dramatic scenes, a few comical moments added with some decent actions scene with touch of oversimplified or stereotypical representation through out. An entertaining movie but not as great as I thought it would be."
" A Bit Of A Hype
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,6,"I just saw this movie on the recommendation of friends. I am more of a Marvel fan, but still interested in about any super-heroic stuff, that I consider in line with humanity's historic myths and legends - a fascinating study. I knew a bit about the comic book version of the Suicide Squad.It is a stylish movie, well-shot, based on an interesting premise: Villains (the government itself) using villains, to fight villains, thus exploring various shades of grey. However, the scenario is quite thin and the filmmakers have chosen to thicken it with the use of facile fan-service. Halfway through the movie, the focus gets lost. Once or twice I thought the movie was ending (it's two hours), only to find out that the real endings were worse than the imagined ones.One form of fan service that irritated me is the constant use of ""cool"", well-known rock music during the most part of the movie. Yeah I know there's the same in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Watchmen"" before that, but still, I don't like the trend. I'd rather have original music or less mainstream tracks to actually fit the spirit of the movie rather than the facile hook of a pop music video.It's clear that Amanda Waller was the comic's most interesting character, in spite of having no powers. Viola Davis, even if she is somewhat lacking in physical stature, gives the role its necessary edge, while keeping a human side, which is quite a feat. Robbie (who moves with beautiful grace) and Leto, as a more glitter-ish Joker, form a great, young-looking couple, their weird victim/abuser chemistry works, and their scenes are among the most intriguing in the movies. Will Smith for his part is at his usual, maybe restrained a bit, maybe uninterested a bit but still pleasant to have. Delavigne offers a eerie Enchanteress, quite different from the one in the comics. I like the way she acted. The Croc guy had the best line of the movie, and the fire guy had potential.On the other hand, Kinnaman was annoying as Flag. Is it the bland character or the actor, who had to fare against Will Smith I don't know, but it worked against the movie, and sometimes won. I cared little about Boomerang, and so was the movie. Katana, the flick's typical chick-with-a-sword could easily have been replaced by a dog or a robot.The worst offenders were the CGI Berry-people that were propped as the zombie-like opposition in most fights, offering ""action"" filled with rock music and total indifference. The characters go through the motions of defeating them without reason or rhyme no matter their power levels. These fights were a good time to go to the bathroom or get some popcorn, which is a shame in this type of movie. It's about time that DC steps up to Marvel in that regard.It is more a DC response to ""Guardian of the Galaxy"" than one for ""Deadpool"", IMO. All in all, a bit beneath my expectations, but still, I think this is a step in the right direction somehow, notably for the use of characters that aren't as mainstream as Superman and Batman. I would favour a sequel that learns from its mistakes, especially if it's about Harlequin and Joker."
" Margot Robbie steels the show
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,4,"The music editing and directing are really poor, but Margot Robbie is absolutely fantastic in every scene, while Will Smith, Jai Courtney, Joel Kinnaman and Jay Hernandez are all impressive and likable.Viola Davis has a bit of a one-track part but she does it well; I personally like Cara Delevigne quite a lot but can understand why people feel her character is a bit generic. Decent action. Basically, the music choices are horrible, but for the song during the pivotal Harley and Joker scene. Margot Robbie is absolutely brilliant and Jai Courtney will shock a few of his doubters."
" Not Worth Your Time
",2017-09-21 00:00:00,1,"When it comes to watching this failed attempt at art, I don't honestly know where to begin. When it comes to movies about the ""Suicide Squad,"" I prefer the animated ones. Those were actually somewhat more tolerable. This live-action filth was not. I watched this movie with my middle brother under our own steam and neither of us were impressed. First and foremost, what was the deal with Will Smith and Margot Robbie? It was like they were the stars of the movie and everyone else was just filler. With those two egos bouncing around like a pinball or two, it was hard to take them seriously. Margot has a voice that is as grating as nails on a chalkboard and she was definitely not the type to play Harley Quinn. I can think of about a couple dozen of other girls that would better fit the mold...but she is not one of them.Viola Davis as Amanda Waller seemed to have just phoned it in. She looked like she was completely bored throughout the entire filming. I have great respect for Viola on a whole, but this was ridiculous. If it wasn't boredom that would have gotten her, it was confusion. She herself looked like she had no idea what was going on.And seriously, what was the deal with Jared Leto being the Joker? For all of the hype that he was given regarding the character, he was only in there for all of maybe 20 minutes and those 20 minutes were simply d-u-l-l. He is not the Joker type, much like Margot Robbie is not the Harley Quinn type. This is right up there when it comes to badness. Seriously. ""Batman v. Superman"" was revolting, ""Deadpool"" was disgusting, this was abominable. I wouldn't see this again on a bet. Too much ego, too little character development, and an absolutely ridiculous plot. This alone should have been rated R for ""repulsive."""

The action is too small and not stressful at all .... Very flat storyline .... It's really a movie that sucks ..."
" What a waste
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,3,"Man this movie sucked. What in the hell is DC doing?!The story was lame, the character build up was boring. I never had the feeling i was rooting for these guy's. Will Smith is alright as Deadshot. But only because its Will Smith. Even the Joker didn't do it for me. I don't like how he looks, and i know comparing it to Heath Ledgers Joker isn't nice, because if i did, this Joker would lose on every front. A shallow, aesthetically superficial 'clown'. He wasn't even really much on screen. It even felt like a forced side story line.The main story isn't really interesting. I saw this movie a week ago, and I'm having trouble to remember it. Something with a witch and dull zombie bad guys.After Batman v. Superman i was expecting another mediocre DC film. But it's not mediocre, it's plainly bad. I miss Nolan."
" Stupid
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,1,"If you're creating a bunch of super hero's to confront supernatural powers then some Aussie throwing a boomerang, and a potty mouthed girl swinging a baseball bat hardly cuts it. This movie is not lacking budget of special effects. Its lacking a degree of thought. Shamefully stupid movie that could have been easily worthwhile with less characters"
" Utter Crap
",2017-09-14 00:00:00,1,"Every once in a while, more often than not unfortunately, you come across a bad film, a film that felt like a waste of time. But it is a very rare instance that you come across a film that actually insults the intelligence of the viewer, and has such a minimal understanding of how to create a conceivably acceptable film.This film has so many flaws, and so much bullsh!t logic that a lot of it flies over your head, not to mention the *horrible* script that puts absolutely no effort into hiding exposition, or make the characters interesting. The editing is one of the fatal flaws, as it is mostly unbearably difficult to figure out what is even happening most of the time, and the titles are subtitles that appear on-screen are displayed so lazily and out of place that not only do you not get enough time to read them, but early in the film one piece of o- screen text becomes greatly obscured by the background. This is a child's level of editing, and its infuriating to watch.The fact that this film can be rightfully named an Academy Award Winner is an utter disgrace, exactly what was so good about Harley Quinn's face paint, and Killer Croc's laughable stupid kids costume? The award was much better suited for Star Trek."
" Makes you wish that everybody died so there'd be no sequels or spinoffs
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,4,"I find most superhero movies too generic and soulless to enjoy them but Suicide Squad"" gives this description a whole new meaning. Not a single f*** was given during watching this meaningless action adventure which gives us a bunch of DC Comics's superheroes incarcerated for their crimes who save the world to get some years off. By the way, for once, the general response to the superhero movie has been similar to mine, suggesting to not waste your time. They battle some superhuman force which looks as mysterious and grand as something straight outta some children's movie. Even most of the superheroes themselves are neither cool nor interesting in any way. Except, maybe, Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), who also have the most lines, including all the best ones. Also appearing, Viola Davis diving straight for the paycheck this time, Jared Leto as Joker (original but toothless rendition of this great character), Joel Kinnaman, Jay Hernandez, Karen Fukuhara et al. Almost everything feels devoid of creativity or fun in this movie. Where did they spend the huge 175 million dollar budget? The result doesn't even look pretty or have gripping action scenes. Avoid! And maybe avoid the inevitable sequel(s) too, because they surely are coming. For all the hate Squad"" has gathered from critics and superhero afficionados and the regular moviegoers, it still managed to bring 745 million U.S. dollars from cinemas. How is it even possible? I can't believe this was written and directed by David Ayer, the man who gave us Harsh Times"", End of Watch"", and Fury"" (also wrote Training Day"" and Dark Blue""). None of the good qualities he usually seems to possess are evident here. Let's hope his upcoming Netflix fantasy action Bright"" also starring Will Smith is much much better! Watched an extended cut which adds 11 minutes for total of 134. Now want the two hours of my life back."
" Great acting. Bad...editing?
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,4,"I'll write about some of the things I haven't seen in the reviews yet so far.. I don't think it's possible at this point to spoil too much for anyone here because chances are, if you care enough about this movie to come to this review board then you've probably already seen the movie, and if you haven't seen it then you probably don't care enough to come to this review board :-) That being said; 1. This film won an Academy Award for best hair and makeup. It should have won an award for best trailer, because the trailer for this film has become famous in itself for being somehow better than the actual movie! I'll give you an example: when Mr. Boomerang Guy says ""You know what they say about the crazy ones.."" and then Harley glances over at him ""Huh?"" it works perfectly in the trailer, right? Unfortunately (spoiler alert) this scene falls completely flat on its face during the course of the actual film. That is just one of seemingly dozens of scenes that were ultimately (bizarrely) disappointing due to either bad writing, bad directing or bad editing. SO many bad lines of dialogue in this. I cannot fault the acting, because well, obviously it COULD have worked, just look at the trailer. Who knows, maybe someday it will attain postmortem status as one of those so-bad-it's-good cult classics, but I don't see how because in the end (spoiler alert) just a very run-of-the-mill superhero action flick which could have been spat out by one of those giant room-sized computers from the 50s. 2. Jared Leto's Joker is not the same as he comes off in the previews. Jared does the same thing here as he did when he played the villain in Panic Room where he imitated Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden. Here, he simply imitates Heath Ledger's Joker and winds up struggling as a cheapo, poor man's knock-off. God, I wanted to like that portrayal. I will get back to the Joker in a minute, because.. 3. This film relies HEAVILY on Margot Robbie delivering slick one-liners like, all the time, interspersed with gratuitous shots of her stripper outfit only covering half her butt. Granted, without Harley Quinn's charm this entire movie would be catastrophically one- dimensional. However, they should have taken the same approach with her as they did with the Joker and used the character sparingly.4. The Joker scenes that you actually DO get to see seem intentionally short and sweet to emulate Nolan's sparse use of Joker in The Dark Knight, but because of this directorial decision the Joker scenes instead end up feeling like a watered-down afterthought. This writer- director didn't develop the character enough! I give credit for trying something new-ish, but Leto doesn't even really get the chance to spread his wings and do much Joker stuff here so it fails at achieving the abstract vision that they were apparently going for. Like, why does he drive a hotrod? Why does he have capped teeth? And I hope you didn't want to see Batman himself, because he's only on the screen for about 12 seconds total! Again, probably not the actors' fault. Understandably they didn't want to make this into a Joker/Batman movie, whatever. 5. The obvious CGI wasn't TOO terrible, but then again, anytime you are aware you are looking at CGI while watching a movie it is a problem that the production team SHOULD feel compelled to contend with. Thankfully, the characters that do rely on CGI (Mr. Crocodile Guy, Mr. Fire Guy) are saved by their good acting.If this movie is your type of thing you should probably just continue to love it and not read the reviews here because some of them are severely harsh. Overall, it's quite evident that this writer-director was trying to go for a more comic book feel for this film than the majority of recent Gotham-themed features, but now I feel I must quote Deadshot: ""What are we, 12?""I mean, how much extra money did they need to pay Will Smith to yell the line: ""Lady, YOU ARE EVIL!!"" (spoiler)"
" Surprisingly Great
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,9,"Not Excellent nor lame. Somewhere above average, and entertaining for a film. I normally have limited interest in films based on comic book characters, but I liked this 'B' movie. Margot Robbie and Jared Leto stole the show. I'm very impressed with Robbie's diverse acting skills. The supporting actors did fine and the script was OK, but cartoon-ish. There's nothing wrong with a little diversion from reality, and the special effects were just fine. If you haven't seen it, then I'll recommend it for when you're in an action adventure mood. It's not as bad as the hyperbole made it out to be. Thus the reason for the follow up sequel coming your way."

" Not one bit of quality
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,1,"Suicide Squad made me actually angry and violent at my friend for buying this ""film"" on DVD and letting me watch it without saying how awful it really was. I had read reviews that said it was bad and gave it 4/10 which is a very misleading score as it suggests some quality things about this movie. Honestly if I could give it 0/10 I would but IMDb only lets you do 1/10 as a valid rating. I have nothing but contempt for this movie as it is poor in every sense of the word!!!Let's start with the plot which is just thrown lazily together as if the people who wrote it were just said ""screw it, let's just focus on getting Harley Quinn in as many sexy uniforms as possible and making loads of money at the box office"". The plot boils down to this government woman, Amanda Waller, putting together a team of super villains to fight other super villains..Sounds like a great idea but when this character explains it 3,4,5 bloody times in the movie it gets a bit wearing and stupid. The team consists of Will Smith (deadshot), Margo Robbie (Harley Quinn) and a load of other characters that are not as flushed out with only three of them being integral to the story. I could go on about characters and plot for 1000 alone but I will just list specifically bad characters that deserve a dishonourable mention.Will Smith plays Will Smith in this movie and is awfulllll at playing a villain of any kind. Will Smith can only play heroes so he just doesn't work as a villain. Margo Robbie as Harley Quinn is just there as a sex symbol and she tries to be the comic relief as well. As a comic relief she is sooooo bad with terrible one liners that do not get any laughs and just leave you with your head in your hands. She is sexy in this film but it is so forced that after a while even teenagers will just go MEH and go back to playing candy crush or take drugs (whatever teenagers do now)Another dishonourable mention goes to the Jared Letto Joker. This is probably the worst joker I have seen on film and the portrayal of him as some kind of kingpin/pimp is very off putting. His relationship with Harley Quinn too is wrong and mismatched. I find it hard for the joker to be in love with Harley as he is supposed to be the living embodiment of chaos and having him act as a love sick puppy trying to get back his girl seems completely wrong to other movies I have seen him in. As an example in the dark knight Nolan and Ledger took care to play and wright the joker as he is supposed to be, an anarchist who cares nothing for no one. They wrote him as someone who wants to ""watch the world burn"". In Suicide Squad he is a pimp and has to say that he is chaos TO THE AUDIENCE instead of showing us he is!!My beef with this ""film"" is not just the characters and the stupid plot but also the technical side of things. This movie is so badly edited that it is painful. A few reviews say that this film feels like one big trailer and that is completely down to poor editing. In this movie scenes do not end or begin they just happen and then a next scene comes up and happens and it is just so crap. Because of the editing the pacing suffers as well as this film is slow and fast paced in such an infrequent way that it gave me an aneurysm in my brain. During shooting the trailer house for this movie also edited parts of the film as well so that is probably why the film looks so disjointed. The lighting during the film is terrible as it is just dark and bland with some bits being so dark that the scenes are close to being underexposed. Underexposed is when a film is so poorly lighted that you can't really see what is going on in the film and this ""film"" definitely does that.The soundtrack as well is garbage. They just get all of these great songs from different artists like Queen, ACDC and Black Sabbath and just put them randomly in the movie without any context at all. You can't just fling songs at the wall and see what sticks. Music is supposed to complement the film and add atmosphere. This film does not do that. NOT ONE BIT!!!!I know this has been a long review but there are just so many problems with this film that I just have to say how BAD this movie is and i'm still not done. I don't think 1000 word limit is enough to explain how sh** this movie is. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!!!"
" As entertaining as it still is, it was quite a disappointment.
",2017-08-31 00:00:00,6,"(Possible spoilers ahead, read at your own risk) As a hardcore Batman/comic/movie fan, this was quite a disappointment. Mostly due to the Writing and editing. The thing that gets me the most is the fact that the trailers advertise a completely different movie. What I expected from the trailers was a dark and gritty action movie peppered with subtle humor for good measure. What I got was a rushed, bloated Hollywood, CGI filled cash grab. I don't think it started out that way, since David Ayer is a talented film maker in my opinion, but I believe once producers and the studios got involved, they focused too much on what many movies suffer from today... Making money. They wanted to market it to as wide of an audience as possible and that was they're mistake. instead of a simple engaging story with insanely interesting characters, we got a mess.Don't get me wrong, it has it's good points. the action is fun, even if it's a bit choppy. The cast and performances were well done for the script they had to work with, and the costume, makeup and general look of the film was great. that's about it. I thought Margot Robbie and Jared Leto were the best things this Movie had going for it and most of their scenes together were in flashbacks, which would have worked if their story was the focal point of the film, but it really had nothing to do with the plot. it's like they were just thrown in the movie because they are the two most recognizable characters.To close out this review, Joker should have been the main antagonist, pulling the strings to create a national threat, all simply to get Harley back, while Harley struggled with going back to Joker or realizing how bad he is for her and developing a new relationship with Deadshot, who would take the role as co protagonist along side Harley, instead of trying to make every member of the squad a main character and ending with no main characters, no one to root for, and an over complicated plot.The anticipation of this movie ended up disappointing me immensely and although I was still entertained, they just didn't get it right"
" Two Words: Not Impressed
",2017-08-29 00:00:00,3,"This movie could have been better if there was more action involved in the film then talking and if we would have seen Batman in more scenes. The only time we see him is when he is fighting Deadshot, stopping Harley Quinn and Joker and when he is talking to Amanda Waller. The acting was good in the film I think the acting was good in the film though Margot Robbie and Will Smith were excellent as Harley Quinn and Deadshot. But my main problem was The Joker in the film. I think Jarad Leto was a miscast as the role he is nothing like Jack Nicolson or Heather Ledger."
" The worst acting
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,3,even though i didn't like the idea of so many super villains i one place i still watched it and i feel horrible for watching this i simply felt uncomfortable watching it and i also hated(small spoiler alert) Harlem Quinn and joker flirting and the horrible acting within this.I never thought a movie in such good hands end up so bad.i personally like more spider-man 2 than this cash brag.i thought it was good because of joker being there but i was wrong
" Trailer = The whole scene
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,7,"This is why I hate to watch trailer first then watch the movie... The trailer just show too much. So when I watch the movie, I said ""aaa.. this is the scene in the trailer. I saw it"" so many times.I still love the character (especially, Harley Quinn, she really stands out!!) tho I expect more for the ending."
" I liked the movie
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,7,"It""s different to other superhero movies and leaves it open for some great sequels. It wasn't just dark and depressing back stories to the characters, i think everyone is over superhero""s who are whiny and depressed about their power when every human dreams of having a special power."
" I am so bad
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,3,"123 min long i have to listen dialogues from ""heros"" how bad they are: oh i am terrible, i kill innocent people, oh no no i am more terrible i kill even children (wtf)?!? After to listen horrible dialogues like this, i have to see them fight against a witch that supposed to be terrible, but she makes only some lights during she moves funny (my rating with 3 stars, is just only about this, yes i think there are existing more bad movies than this)"
" Bad writing/script, as usual from D.Ayer film
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,3,"Finally rented this movie from the local library three days ago and wasn't disappointed: because I knew it was going to be bad and it was just as bad as I thought it was going to be. I knew it was going to be bad, so that is why I didn't spend any of my money on it, just 2hrs of my time, (which wasn't worth it). After seeing End of Watch and then Fury (I own Fruy on DVD), both of which are ""gritty"" and ""realistic"" D.Ayer fails again to write a good scene. It's his fault his movies suck because I think he thinks he should write good movie scenes, not scenes that look good in a movie. The actors say their lines and they sound like line in a cheesy movie, not authentic or real; they sound like they're written to check off a box. Okay the characters now; I'm sorry to start with the chick with the bat: why is she there other than to have a ""main"" female lead who is not Jennifer Lawrence(which I'm glad she wasn't cast, as she would have made this worse like she did for X-Men)? No superpowers, weight 100lbs, isn't a martial artist, and used to be a psychologist. The Joker was out of place here and made worse by J.Leto's performance: he looks out of place and board; no real need for him to be in the movie other than to have the joker in the movie since the batman makes a cameo. the main story/protagonist is who again? the other chick or the tall Aztec guy? I just lost interest. Oh yeah and the thing the chick with the bat say about kill everyone and escape? How exactly? she weight 100 lbs... surrounded by Navy SeALs? Oh and the black strawberry head thingies? What's with them? Was I supposed to feel frightened or surprised in seeing them? Black strawberry head thingies, really? And the old government chick shoots all her staff and says they're not cleared for this? Weren't they vetted or hired by her? weren't they just working for her? Did I miss something there or was she doing this to be tough because D.Ayer wrote the scene just to show how cold and ruthless she's suppose to be? Somehow the cartoon Amanda Waller from Batman TAS and Superman TAS was portrayed better (I know that was a series and the longer season allows for the development of the character), but this version was badly written and ""fleshed out,"" and acted just as bad (maybe this wasn't Viola's fault, as her performance is guide by the director and he's supposed to make the actor become the person). The trailer with the Queen music was the best part, unfortunately; I still see the trailer every once in-a-while just to try and forget how bad the movie actually was."
" I'm Sorry But I Just Have To Write Something
",2017-08-18 00:00:00,1,"After a year of storing the downloaded copy of this movie, I finally watched it today (19/08/2017).And yes: I JUST HAVE TO WRITE SOMETHING TO RELEASE MY PENT-UP FRUSTRATION OF WASTING MY TIME ON THIS PIECE OF DC GARBAGE.First and foremost, let's just say that we ALL know we are watching a sci-fi movie. So the enemies are also gonna be out-of-this-world. But, really? Are they? Oh yes, sure they do, starting with the 'Enchantress', who is supposedly to be 'attached' to one lady and can emerge ONLY when being called upon. On top of that, she can literally teleport, going anywhere as she wishes.As the show progresses, we are told that the female controller 'Waller' has her heart, and she can actually 'control' the Enchantress by...doing things to it (?). So why did the Enchantress NOT teleport to her heart, grab it and go, LIKE WHAT SHE DID IN THE SHOW EVENTUALLY? We are not told. Just some random scene of Waller telling her history, and the next thing we know, the Enchantress had gotten her heart back.Then we have one legion of enemy army who are nothing else but 'humans' wearing faceless masks, running all over the place just to get beaten, smashed, slashed, shot and killed by this 'awesome' Suicide Squad. How scary was that? Very NOT scary at all.And how do this 'army' get to be so faceless and 'out-of-this-world'? By having the Enchantress KISSING - that's right, you read that correctly and clearly - every captured soldier and turning them into that faceless army. Well, talk about 'oral hygiene', notwithstanding bad breath, decay tooth and whatnots! Then, we are reminded once and again by that woman 'Waller' to be 'very careful/ be caution' of this army, JUST TO HAVE THEM ACTING TOTALLY HUMAN-LIKE, WITH ABSOLUTELY Z.E.R.O. EXTRAORDINARY POWER. They, albeit the masks, ARE JUST LIKE ANY OTHER HUMAN ARMY! LOL So how 'very dangerous' and 'very deadly' are they exactly? Z_I_L_C_H danger.Then the Joker appeared with a stolen helicopter that had his man shooting Waller and her Squad company. That totally irritating Harley simply stood up, all in the midst of gun-firing, to jump into the arms of her lover Joker - SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE RECEIVED HIS MESSAGE VIA HER HANDPHONE.And when the helicopter went down, she actually MADE HER WAY BACK TO THE SQUAD, WITH THE WHOLE TEAM HAVING NO EXPRESSION, AND EVERYONE JUST WENT ON AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. JEEEZZZZ...W.T.F WAS THE SCRIPTWRITER THINKING? HIS MOTHER'S PANTIES PERHAPS WHEN PENNING THE SCRIPT? After a good useless 1.5 hours of talking and acting as if the Squad is very powerful, we are shown to have the finale - the Squad squaring off the Enchantress and her brother, whom the latter despite getting shot at by every available firearm from the Squad and experiencing no effect, ACTUALLY GOT KILLED BY A BOMB. Yes, a bomb. So bullets = no effect. But bomb = yes, killed.And what do we have for Enchantress? Nothing, but just PLAIN ARMED-COMBAT + CLOSE-RANGE FIGHT. Yes, a WITCH who has ""completed her powers"", actually goes into an armed, close-range hand combat with the Squad. How fantastically...retarded that is? VERY retardy, I must say.Of course, all baddies got killed in the end, with the Squad acting as if they really don't care and give a f*ck.But I really got to pen it down here: Suicide Squad, just like Man of Steel, IS ONE BIG GARBAGE THAT IS PROBABLY WRITTEN BY SOME LOW-IQ FELLAS WHO THINK THEY ARE 'SOMEBODY', BUT IN ACTUAL FACT, A RETARD IN REAL LIFE. Man of Steel had the same old sh!t - Superman can bash, kick, slap, ram, punch, and do all other stuff to his nemesis Zod, with ZERO effect. But at the end of the show, how did he kill Zod? That's right - by engaging in a close-range, unarmed combat that had Zod's neck twisted. Just that simple. Suicide Squad's Enchantress is so powerful, yet engaged in a close-range, armed combat, and again with a simple slash to her chest, GOT THE SHOW ENDED. Lazy script-writing? Absolutely? DC sh!tty production? 100% certainly.Conclusion: do not spend any more money on DC sh!t. Just follow what I did: waited for their cr@p to come out and fade away, download their torrent and show, watch it, AND DELETE IT FROM YOUR COMP DRIVE COMPLETELY. Their shows and productions do NOT deserve a spot even in my storage."
" Great movie, but the lack of The Joker scenes pulls it down
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,7,"Suicide Squad had potential to be one of the very best movies, but sadly it failed by not using the most charismatic character of them all very much. Though the remaining characters has a great chemistry and makes the best of what they've got. Cara Delevingne, Margot Robbie and Will Smith (as their respective characters) is the reason that Suicide Squad is rated as it is, simply because they made their characters really deep and detailed, and accompanied by the individual talent they poses, made the movie worth seeing."
" Best
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,10,"Joker. Joker is something, means something for us, the watchers. I like the relation joker/harley and there is more. I like the relation of batman with joker. They complete each other and that means a great movie and a great storyline. In my opinion this movie, Suicide Squad is the best movie of 2016. All things put together are more than perfect."
" Just nothing that the trailer promised
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,3,"Honestly, just a huge let down in general compared to what was hyped up in the trailers. The whole second half was just filled with plot holes and terrible writing. Random no body characters popping in and out to extended the amount of content but in terms of quality story telling, it just didn't make sense. This is the universe with heroes like Superman and Batman, and you're going to send a group of criminals in with no team-training or plan to just save the world? Why not start smaller? At least Marvel (yes I'm comparing the two) builds up the franchise slowly, character by character, with problems that are within the scope of the heroes ability to fix. A girl with a baseball bat, a marksman, a crocodile, a samurai (who I really had no feelings for whatsoever) and the flame guy from fantastic 4, had no reason to defeat the final boss who had ridiculous powers. Overall, I'd like my money back from seeing that 'movie' as much as I want Heath Ledger and Christian Bale back as Batman and Joker but hey we all know that's not going to happen."
" Rating: C+
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,5,"Will Smith as Deadshot is great, it's his best performance in the last few years and his character has the most interesting and heartfelt backstory. There's even a scene with another character from the DCEU (DC Extended Universe) where he shows the first signs of humanity present in him and that is really cool to watch. He is also the main source of entertainment and fun in the film, he basically throws his Will Smith's charisma in there and it works really well. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn portrays perfectly this known character from the comics, she's exactly like I wanted her to be. She gets that crazy insanity just right, she's super funny and also has some moments of humanity throughout the movie. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller is really great as well, I can't say too much about her (no spoilers in here), but I honestly can't wait to see her again in future installments. She's bad-ass!Batman (Ben Affleck) appears in the movie for a couple of scenes and he's awesome, Boomerang (Jai Courtney) is a pleasant surprise, he actually has a personality in this film and The Joker (Jared Leto) ... Is fine. I'm really not sure of how I feel about this interpretation of one of the most famous villains ever. Jared Leto tried to mix the vibe of the previous actors that portrayed this character (Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson) and I guess I'll have to wait until another movie is released because The Joker barely has a scene in this one ... With this in mind, I move on to my list of cons, which are more than I expected.The Joker isn't relevant, at all, in this movie. The trailer and all of the advertising for this movie is a complete fraud! They tried to make him the villain until the release because they weren't sure that Deadshot and Harley Quinn were enough to sell this movie. He has some good scenes and that's it ... Disappointing. Also, there are some other characters that are in the film without a purpose: Katana (Karen Fukuhara), Slipknot (Adam Beach) or even Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) ... They're just there because the film needed them to form the squad, I guess.The first act is good, but it's so choppy and has a lot of flashbacks. In fact, the whole movie has flashbacks thrown into it with no structure whatsoever, either 10 minutes into the movie or 10 minutes before the end of it. Not that they're bad, actually they're pretty interesting and the best part of the movie (some actually would give a good story for a solo movie), but so badly edited. The beginning is total exposition, we have this whole set of flashbacks and cuts to set up these characters. I understand they need to introduce them, but they do it in such a lazy way, literally like, ""Hey, this is Deadshot. He shoots people and has a daughter. Care about him."". It's definitely not the best way to do it. It's a shame that a film with so many great characters under- utilizes them so much.The other two acts are literally a mix of different scenes that turn into one big mess. I know for a fact that after Batman V Superman received some negative reviews about the darker tone present in the movie, the producers re-shot a lot of scenes just to add a little more of a lighter vibe to Suicide Squad. That just made things worse, they try to put together a darker and lighter tone at the same time and it doesn't work out. Even the soundtrack, which I thought would be amazing (and it was in some scenes), comes out completely wrong in some moments. It's a complete mishmash.Another problem with this movie is the main villain, who kind of remained omitted since in the trailers it was almost all The Joker. I don't consider it a spoiler, you probably know already who this character is, but still, I'm warning you ... Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) is a witch that can control people's minds and apparently dance ... Yes, that's all she does in 90% of the movie, dance. She stands in the middle of the city for the whole time just moving her arms around and pretending she has a hula hoop in her hips. She couldn't be less of a plot device for the squad to have a purpose and do something, I don't even blame the actress because she had to spend most of her time looking at a green screen and speaking some strange language. I actually liked the introduction to this character, the first time she turns into Enchantress is amazing, but after a subway scene, she becomes CGI awful.The ending is terrible, it remembered me of Fantastic Four's ending of last year ... It's that bad. Literally, there's a character who is definitely dead, it has ""tentacles"" going through its body and after 5 minutes ... It's fine, nothing happened, clothes are clean, everything's perfect. The plot given for the squad doesn't make a lot of sense when you have superheroes like Batman, Wonder Woman, or The Flash in this universe ... Why would a girl with a bat or a guy that shoots really well fight a super-powerful being that can destroy them in seconds if he wishes to? Just wait until you know how they kill them and stop the beacon ...I really expected more of this movie, it has really great characters, some amazing performances from the cast, some funny scenes, but the story is unstructured, the action isn't that good (the ""monsters"" that they have to defeat along the way are at the level of a Stormtrooper) and the plot doesn't really make sense.Not bad, but disappointing.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" The nail in the coffin for DCEU movies until Wonder Woman came out...
",2017-08-02 00:00:00,6,"When this movie opened during the same weekend as the Summer Olympics in Rio on TV, it broke a record set by Guardians two years prior to the first weekend of August 2016. Reaction to the movie was a bit mixed yet it was more comedic than the seriousness of BVS: DOJ, which ranks among the worst superhero movies of all time if you exclude the extended version. Jared Leto's Joker doesn't live up to Heath Ledger or even Jack Nicholson; the only saving grace in this movie is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn in the first live action role for this character, which actually debuted in the 1992 Batman cartoon before starring in the comic books. The soundtrack to this movie is great, and the visual effects are OK."
" It was fine.
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,7,"I loved the movie. I feel like Jerred Letto didn't give the Joker feel and Margot Robbie did well as Harley, but didn't pull off the accent too well. It bothered me a bit how the had lack of jokes for her and I feel like the character could have been written better. The looks, however, feel too edgy. I also dislike the race change of Deadshot and how Will Smith was, yet again. I hope the next movie will be better. I loved the special effects, but things need to be changed. Stop doing it just for diversity."
" A wasted opportunity for DCs cinematic universe
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,4,"I went into this film with reasonably high expectations (despite the fact that I generally dislike superhero movies) due to their predictable plots, 2 dimensional characters and cheesy jokes not to mention the reality that films such as this are being heartlessly made on a production line like canned food for profit not art as they should be. Anyway with that out of the way I thought ""well its DC (my preferred universe over Marvel) and it seems to have interesting characters that I may grow to like throughout the film as they develop."" I couldn't have been more wrong. The film opens with an extremely rushed introduction to the 'Heroes' or 'Villains' (however you want to look at it) with only a few minutes dedicated to an entire character we're supposed to like or at least like enough for the entire 2 hour run time (great). Overuse of popular songs in our introduction is an understatement (I thought I was watching countless music videos one after another, not an effective beginning at all). The tone of this film is all over the place one minute its light hearted and supposedly 'funny' and the next it cuts to the Joker shooting someone in the face for no apparent reason. Speaking of the Joker he could have been cut out of this movie and NOTHING would have changed. ""But I wonder why he was on all of the posters and ads"" you may ask, well I can answer that: MONEY! This goes for practically all superhero movies instead of making films that can stand on their own they need to connect to endless spin offs and sequels which some suckers will pay to see. The plot was another thing that didn't make sense Amanda Waller played by Viola Davis who created the 'Suicide Squad' was also the individual who caused the threat which caused the death of two members. The threat being the 'Enchantress' played by Cara Delevingne (who could not act or dance). Scenes seemed to flash backwards and forwards randomly and added nothing to the film. And despite the fact that this film was supposed to be 'Cool', 'edgy' and maybe kind of original we get the exact boring and pointless endings in many superhero films: the laser in the sky with the fitting ""I'm evil and I want to take over the world"" cliché. (another reason why I dislike these films). Another thing to add was the amount of awful looking CGI and bad villain soldier designs, for a $175 million budget! It is fairly obvious that I really didn't like this film but I will say that the concept was interesting if executed right, some of the flashbacks were intriguing- most notably the Jokers, the look of the main characters was fitting and the gritty aspects were nice. I just wanted those aspects and a coherent story with less characters so you'd have more time for the few therefore deeper and more meaningful backgrounds are established so you'd actually care when they died (or nearly did). If it was like 'Watchmen' which I thoroughly enjoyed and expected this to be it may have restored hope for DC and renewed my interest in superhero films as a whole. But I guess that was too much to ask...."
" Failure
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,4,"I know that i am a year late, but i just wanted to re-enter the comment nightmare to Suicide squad. This movie didn't do everything it promised. It was supposed to be the nr.1 movie in America and they said it was going to be awesome and extreme, but the reality is that after batman vs. superman the directer to the suicide squad movie got a little self-conscious and did a hole number of rewrites . That is not saying that it was a good movie to begin with, its just that in the trailer we saw a bunch of scenes, and characters that didn't make it to the final product. I think that DC should have hired another writer for this movie. It would have been amazing if DC gave Christopher Nolan the opportunity to make this movie into a bloody masterpiece."
" Chicken salad
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,1,"I can't even find the right words to describe how bad this movie is - so here's a recipe for a bad chicken sallad1 Chicken 3 eggs 3 sallad 1 bottle of red wine.Stir the eggs, chicken and sallad together while you drink the whole bottle of red wine and forget you saw this sorry excuse for a movie."
" Kind of all over the place
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,6,"I went into this movie not really knowing a lot about these characters. I left the movie still not knowing a lot about most of the characters - The only ones that really got any development was Deadshot and Harley Quinn. The rest might as well have been in the background. The Plot was all over the place and the minions were literally faceless and you could barely see them they were so dark in a dark movie. Not sure what the Joker was even doing in the movie. And the guy who played him was awful. Did enjoy The characters of Deadshot and Harley Quinn and, unlike other reviews, I liked the humor in the movie. It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it wasn't the worst either. All in all, an OK afternoon of movie watching."
" Idiotic movie
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,2,"One must be a complete idiot to like this movie. Really wrong message, no meaning, waist of money and time. I would say it is a classic Hollywood crap, but that would be an insult all the crap movies makers. I really hope that actors like Will Smith will read the scenario before they signing the contract next time. That is if there were a scenario in the first place."
" One scene absolutely ruined this movie for me
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,1,"Let's be honest, it was just a bad movie. Jared Leto's Joker may have been the worst ever. How do you screw this role up? He played the Joker as some scummy wannabe rapper. Unbelievable stuff. This is the sort of thing that had to come out of a corporate focus group.Much of the production, action scenes and stunts were terrible and dated. It was like watching a 90's movie. How awful is David Ayer at film making? Seriously. It's like going back in time, watching the sets in this film. It looks like one of those old Universal theme park rides from back in the day.But let's get to the one scene that just made me want to walk out. It's when Amanda Waller kills the FBI agents in the Tact Ops office. One reason I hated it is because it's classic David Ayer. He HATES authority and thinks everyone in power is working for the devil. Look at all of his movies. There's a theme. Maybe he met one dirty cop in his life. Who knows? This is how he portrays ANYONE who works for the government, as the right hand of Satan. It's juvenile.Secondly, the reaction of everyone to the massacre was one big joke. Rick Flagg is supposed to be the Boy Scout Special Ops soldier and he's rather ""oh well"" about it. Will Smith is impressed and thinks it's cool. It's messed up and contradicts the writer's development of these characters. I couldn't take it seriously anymore. I found it unbelievable that Waller could get away with that, nor could I see WHY she did it, considering the cat was out of the bag about everything, anyways! Also, wouldn't you think, ""Hey, maybe she'll do this to me very soon?""I will never see another film Ayer makes, ever again."
" Doesn't Deserve the Hate
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,8,"I took a chance on Suicide Squad despite the non-stop barrage of hate from both fans and critics. And I was pleasantly surprised. No, this isn't a great film, but it is quite an enjoyable one. It lacks the self-importance and obsessive fan service of the more mainstream comics-based movies, which allows it to succeed as a simple bit of entertainment.The extended 'Dirty Dozen' setup works well, and the interplay between the seriously off-key characters pumps a bit of desperately needed fresh air into the superhero genre. The absence of major comic-book stars is a huge bonus, making the plot slightly less predictable.Don't view this as belonging to the ""DC Universe,"" or the ""Batman canon,"" or any other tired, anal-retentive fan framework. It's a simple, standalone movie, with cool characters and fast action. It's actually FUN, which is something you can't say about most comics-inspired films any more."
" Missed opportunity
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,7,"It's a tricky one because certain characters were amazing like Amanda Waller, Harley and the joker. it felt like none of the characters got enough time on screen to make them significant in anyway and the fight scenes took over. To be honest it would've been a much more interesting film if it was all centred around Harley and Joker - who for me killed it. The film definitely left me wanting more of them but I could take or leave the rest of the squad. Hopefully a sequel could give joker and Harley more of a focus - I though Margot Robbie and Jared Leto were amazing."
" This film could have been great, but just didn't have enough life to make it better than what it was.
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,5,"Suicide Squad had some great performances by both Will Smith and Margot Robbie, and had a fantastic soundtrack. For the most part this film was pretty entertaining when the villain, pacing, and setting wasn't holding it down. So for my review of the film I decided to give Suicide Squad an ""Alright"" on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. This film could have been great, but just didn't have enough life to make it better than what it was. I came into the film knowing nothing about the movie or characters, and walked out having felt my free ticket and $8 dollar drink was worth my two hours of sitting in the theater. ""So should I go see it?"" Well that's a great question. If it's raining out and you have nothing else better to do, then sure. But other than that, I think the only worth it has is renting it from Redbox 6 months from now.Read more at theVade."
" It Has Some Fun Moments and Some Solid Performances, but It's Still a Pretty Weak Movie Overall
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,5,"I saw the premiere of this movie with some friends last year. We had fun watching it and we liked it. However, after rewatching it on X-Finity and reevaluating it, the movie isn't really that good. There are some things in it to keep you entertained, but it is still another weak film from the DCEU.I liked Will Smith as Deadshot. This is an unusual thing for Smith to play an assassin, but he pulled it off well, and his character was pretty interesting. I also liked Harley Quinn. This was the first time the character was adapted to live action, and Margot Robbie was convincing in the role.There were also some pretty good action sequences and the film did get a few laughs out of me.Sadly, all the other villains on the team were considerably less interesting and didn't get enough character development to really get behind them. The interactions between the villains were pretty forced for the most part.Jared Leto was pretty good as The Joker, but he was wasted because he was barely in the movie at all.The story was very weak and the pacing could have been a lot better. Also bad is the depressingly murky color palette. Some bright colors in the film couldn't hurt, you know!A lot of people think that this is even worse than ""Batman v. Superman,"" but I disagree. I enjoyed it more than that film because at least this film is fairly entertaining at times and had a few good performances. However, this is still a mostly unsuccessful effort from the DCEU. Thankfully, things would get much better with the next DCEU film, ""Wonder Woman.""RATING: C"

",2017-07-08 00:00:00,1,"It's almost suicide just to view this pathetic film from 2016. Will someone please tell me how accomplished Oscar winner Viola Davis subjected herself to such a miserable film.No, this is not exactly 1967's ""The Dirty Dozen,"" where deviants are forced to fight the Nazis. This instead is right out of a comic book fancy with unimaginable villains in prison recruited to fight evil forces threatening to destroy the world.There is enough shooting for ten life-times. The special effects is about the only good thing in this mess of a film.My two favorite female deviants in the film were the psychiatrist who went astray due to her love for an inmate and the archaeologist who fell into the wrong underpass and had a negative life-altering experience.It becomes confusing when some of the deviants join with our crusaders.Evil was really never this bad."
" Top Three Superhero Movies Of All Time
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,7,"I don't care what you say. Suicide Squad is a bad ass movie. It may be almost entirely because of The Joker and Harley Quinn. But it's just so cool. The first half of the movie cement it as perhaps the greatest superhero movie ever made, and then the second half push it back two movies. But I can't deny it's not good.I really liked all the characters in this movie. At first, they were too much to handle, and I care little about them. But the movie deals with it's main characters first, and uses the others as comic relief mainly. Jared Leto as Joker! Doesn't get much better than this7 Stars"
" Is this a joke?
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,3,"Suicide Squad is a horrible movie. There is only one good thing about this movie, there are a few parts that, the movie is really bad. The editing is a mess, music is crammed in everywhere, Deadshot's daughter was a horrible child actor, Joker has around six minutes of screen time despite being heavily advertised and most of the dialogue is cringe worthy.I heard that there was tons of studio interference, and they had six weeks to write a script. I forgive everyone working on the story in that case. OK that was just me reviewing it. Now I'm going to rant on the Joker as a comic book fan.The Joker is not The Joker. He looks horrible, Joker doesn't act like this, and he loves Harley. So I'm kind of happy that he got six minutes of screen time.3.1/10 (Really bad) Worse than Batman v Superman and Man of Steel by far. I'm just happy that Wonder Woman saved the DCEU for now. Hopefully, this is the worst DCEU film ever to be made."
" The best movie in 2016

I think everyone should vote 10\10. In the end everyone has there taste. The actors, story, songs and everything it just perfect! I really like ""Heathens-Twenty One Pilots"" I mean you can't stop listening to that song. I haven't forgot Harley and Joker love it was totally amazing !"
" This movie is exploitation

I know this is supposed to be tongue in cheek but it wasn't funny. its compensation for for no story, bad characters. who would like this movie? donno. if these are real comic book characters, they are lamest. if its to see the joker, you'll be disappointed because there is not much of him. if its to see margot robbie in a teeny porn outfit. sad"
" Suicide Blah
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,5,"After the disappointing ""Batman v Superman"", it was hoped ""Suicide Squad"" would make up for it.The opening moments are promising: the events of Suicide Squad are linked to the end of BvS and the 'bad guys doing bad things for a good cause' has promise.Unfortunately, that's where the promise ends.""Suicide Squad"" doesn't learn from BvS's mistakes, overstuffing the film with too many villains and a weak antagonist.The highlights of the film are Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and Deadshot (Will Smith); had ""Suicide Squad"" focused more on them, it would have been better. The problem with ""Suicide Squad"" is cramming so many relatively obscure villains in one movie; the necessary backstories are rushed – just enough to give context.""Suicide Squad"" would have been a lot better as a long-form Netflix series, with more time to establish characters and gradually set the stakes for a big finale.There are some decent cameos from Ben Affleck's Batman and Ezra Miller's The Flash but the humour (apparently inserted after the BvS backlash) feels forced at times.Hopefully ""Suicide Squad 2"" can fix the mistakes of the first film."
" Scraping the bottom here
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,3,"Come here, DC. Come here, we need to have a talk. This is your intervention. Now, I don't know who first gave you these ideas. And don't play coy with me, son. I found these under your bed. Recognize these? Yeah, I know what these are. The parents have been warned about these Batman-And-Nothing-But-Batman ideas that have been circulating in our neighborhood. Now, I don't know who - though I'm thinking it was that Snyder boy, although young mister Nolan is also a suspect - but as it comes to you, it needs to stop. Can't you see what they have done to you. You used to be such a happy boy. You went outside even when it wasn't raining. You talked about things other than horrific civilian casualties and billions in property damage. There was joy in you, colours even. You need to understand that Batman... is whack. It's not cool, it's not good for you and it needs to stop.Yeah... as you probably figured out by now, not a huge fan of this film. We all prayed that this would be the film to change the course for the DCEU. After only two films we were already tired of grey backgrounds, grey characters, grey moralities and nothing but rain and gloom. And sure, this looked pretty grey as well in the trailers, but at least it promised us something that we had sorely missed: a sense of humour.But no, what we ended up getting was even worse than the previous films. Those films were overly gloomy, dark and trying too hard to recapture the aesthetic of Nolan's Batman trilogy. But at least they had pretty clear story lines, fleshed out characters and you could nominally root for the main characters. Whereas this film is just as grey, dark and gloomy, perhaps even more so, and it had none of those things. There are way too many characters, meaning that we in our heads relocate them to the cannon fodder file almost immediately. The story makes no sense whatsoever and is frustratingly circular in that if the people setting out to solve a problem would have done nothing, things would have been fine. And then there's the fact that you can't even really care for the main characters. Because they're villains! And the funny thing is that they remind us of this constantly.And sure, villains are cool and they can be empathized with, but that last one requires effort. And usually inhuman space monsters as opponents for contrast. Here the only even remotely cool villain is Deadshot. But that's because he's played by Will Smith. The man could play a potato sack with no lines of dialogue and he'd still have a fair chance of being the coolest character in the film. Plus, in this film it helps that he's one of two villains to have any substantial backstory. The other being Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), who surprise surprise is the other villain worth caring about.Had this been like the trailers promised, it would have been pretty good. But it's not. It's not cool, it's not funny and there's barely any Joker in it. Now, personally I hate Jared Leto as Joker, but at least he would have been something to focus on. And had this film even had the music like in the trailers, it could have had something resembling a style. But no, the music is there for a few seconds at a time and never is the scene wrapped around the music. Wasted opportunity if there ever was one.This is the worst DCEU film to date, and that's saying something. Not worth seeing, not worth your money and not worth the effort put into it. You're on thin ice, DC. Get into rehab!"
" Such Great Potential
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,7,"I had very high hopes for the movie Suicide Squad although the outcome did not meet my expectations. I really liked the idea of this movie, and the concept was amazing. I reckon if the writers spent a longer time on the movie, it could be one of the best DC has ever produced. Although the cast and soundtrack were great, I really thought hat the movie would overall be much better."
" Zero should be an option
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,1,"I still don't understand why projects like this one get funded and supported. The thing that bothers me the most is that people still think that it's one hell of a movie, when it definitely is not. The plot is... in fact there is no plot, everything is just so silly and unbelievable. There is no character development what so ever. It's just embarrassing. It deserves a zero."
" Spoilers* 3rd rate DC characters in a bad installment of the mummy franchise
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,3,"Spoilers, if this movie can really be spoiled... Take some low grade DC villains fit for the imaginations of 10yr olds, plus Perry Farrell as the Joker, send them through a Hot Topic and equip them with naughty words for the teens. Have the irrelevant ones (everyone but the Joker) manipulated by a Nick Fury archetype, taking away the need to build characters beyond a minimum and have them all play blindfolded catchphrase darts while alternately portraying them as deadly and inept, whenever convenient. Throw them into the plot of a Mummy sequel part way through, use the action from a God Of War game, and finish up with the ubiquitous threat of the evil hole of light in the sky. Rick Moranis missed his opportunity to come out of a fried monster carcass again. Only Matter-Eater Lad could have saved this film."
" What Can I Say? I Like Crap
",2017-06-21 00:00:00,7,"This is one of those unexplained aspects in my life to where reasons and comprehension are thrown out the ****ing window. I can't even rationalize why I liked this movie. I understand that Suicide Squad is annoying at times. The scene where the girl cries like a little stupid b!t(# because she doesn't want Deadshot to shoot Batman was so irritating I actual wish she got shot in her ugly face. Croc was a stupid villain. The Witch was stupid. The ever infamous bar scene was one those scenes that will make some feel mortified even when you are watching this alone. The story, though easy to follow, was unfocused and retarded. So, yes, I can't explain why I liked this movie but I do.Well, this is what I liked about Suicide Squad. I actually like some the acting performances. The chick who played Harley Quinn, Joker, Deadshot were the ones who stood out while the others were descent enough at best. I liked the action and the effects. And well that's about it. I gave this movie a 7 and I know it doesn't deserve even half that amount but what can I tell you? I have no taste so suck a ****."
" Suicidal Silliness... Stop spewing such swill
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,4,"Such a waste of star power. I only enjoyed seeing Margot Robbie, and even Will Smith couldn't help. Run of the mill plot, ridiculously overpowered villain, blah sequel bait of an ending.My second chance to DC after the disaster that was BvS. Much better, but still below average movie."
" disappointing, shabby mess
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,3,"I'll state up front I'm not a huge superhero movie fan. I will watch em if I think they are going to be good and entertaining. Having said that, there are a few superhero movies that pass the sniff test and qualify as great movies. I enjoyed the earlier ""Spiderman"" movies before they spun too deeply into the realm of fanboy absurdity. I thought ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was an extremely well done and entertaining movie, loved it. ""Deadpool"" was a lot of fun, as was ""Hellboy"". Tim Burton's Batman is the crown jewel of superhero movies as far as I'm concerned, and it's the benchmark by which I judge the others by. ""The Dark Knight"" was pretty good (in spite of Bale's laughably pathetic portrayal of Batman) due mainly to a very strong supporting cast, including an amazing performance of The Joker by the late Heath Ledger.I really wanted to like Suicide Squad. Initially, it sounded to me like it might be a fresh take on a tired, worn down and clichéd genre. And really, it did have the potential to be a very good, if not great, superhero movie. Wrong. This film suffered from so many different things I really don't know where to start.Casting....this movie is a casting nightmare, period. The only, and I mean only character that was cast well was Harley Quinn. Margot Robbie delivered a solid, believable performance and she did do a good job with the garbage she was given to work with. She carries every scene she's in, and her performance was the only reason I didn't simply stop watching the movie. Will Smith delivered a weak performance in a role he wasn't well suited at all to play. He came across as a blend between Hancock and his character from ""I am Legend"". They couldn't have picked a worse person to play this role. Which brings me to Jared Leto. There aren't many actors that can pull off the complex role of The Joker convincingly. Nope, Leto isn't on that list. He came across as nothing more than a creepy, disgusting thug...The Joker is so much more than that. He brought absolutely none of the intangibles, depth or complexity it takes to pull off that particular role. And the makeup...wow...it looked like little more than a rushed Halloween costume. Thankfully his role in the movie was mercifully small and his scenes were short. In spite of this he still managed to ruin the character of The Joker for all practical purposes. The rest of the characters I won't even mention, there were far too many of them to even try to pay attention to or care about....which leads us to...The storyline/plot. Bad. period. Its essentially a cheap ripoff of the basic plot line of ""The Dirty Dozen"", except the Suicide Squad version doesn't work at all. Way too much going on with way too many shallow characters. It appeared that as they were writing it and ran into blocks or couldn't come up with a good idea, they simply threw a new minor superhero character in there as a distraction. More is better, right? In this case, no....this would have been a far better movie if they had picked three or four characters to focus on and gone from there. Maybe they felt like none of the major characters were solid enough to carry the movie so they made up for that by adding every minor and uninteresting comic character they could come up with. Aside from cliché flashback scenes, character development of the major players is virtually non existent. And they have so many of them you simply stop caring about any of them. By the end of the movie, I didn't care if they won or lost, who lived or died, I just wanted it to be over.Overall, aside from a few decent Harley Quinn scenes, there is little of watchable or entertaining quality here, unlikely to appeal to any but the most hardcore superhero fanboys. It's a shame really, it did have the potential to be a really good movie,but it's just way too flawed on on way too many levels. Skip this one."
" Entertaining, and better than expected
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,7,"With Superman dead, the world needs a new band of superheroes to step into the breach. Senior US Intelligence officer Amanda Waller comes up with a daring plan - use extreme criminals with special abilities to fight crime, in exchange for them receiving reduced sentences. The band of crime-fighting criminals is officially known as Task Force X, but due to the nature of their mission a more appropriate name would be Suicide Squad. Reasonably entertaining. Starts off very well - the background and scene setting were great and promised much for the remainder of the movie. Unfortunately, the remainder doesn't quite live up to this promise, as the plot loses focus to an extent.This all said, the movie has great momentum and is never boring. There are some great action scenes and dialogue and the performances provide a great energy to the movie. The standout (for many reasons!) is Margot Robbie who is excellent as Harley Quinn. Jared Leto is great as The Joker (the character seems to inspire great performances - thinking Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger in the past). Solid work too from Will Smith, as Deadshot, and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller.After all the criticism of the movie, it was much better than expected. I can only think it was your typical comic book and superhero movie fans who were disappointed, as this movie is a bit different to most of the genre. I've never read the Suicide Squad comics, and generally am not a fan of comic book / superhero movies, so was able to watch with any preconceived ideas of what this should be like. Objectivity helps."
" Directed by The Joker
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,2,"Suicide Squad aka We're The Bad Guys is almost as bad as Batman v Superman. Nothing in this movie makes any darn sense...I watched it with an open mind, but it's impossible to enjoy this movie, or care about any of the characters. If Batman v Superman can be compared to sleep paralysis, Suicide Squad is what happens when you eat one of the strange mushrooms that grow in the woods. What a weird, Transformers 3-ish movie! The only thing that's missing from the movie is Shia LaBeouf.This movie could have been good. Even though it's a movie about fictional comic book characters, they could have used those characters to explore stuff like the cruel treatment of prisoners in the US, corruption, redemption, forgiveness etc. There's bits and pieces of that sprinkled throughout the movie, but most of the time it's about boring slow motion fight scenes, Harley Quinn's buttocks and really bad jokes.The best part is when Harley Quinn imagines herself living a normal life with the Joker. It's really sad that they wasted a scene like that in a terrible movie like this...Imagine if someone made a movie like that, where one of the villains actually managed to change. That would truly be something new and original in a comic book movie. Joker/Two- Face/Killer Croc gives Batman a message to meet him at the abandoned toy factory/bell tower. We expect a big, violent fight scene, but instead, the villain breaks down and cries. I'm not against action and fight scenes...but modern superhero movies brag about how they're for grownups, grounded in reality and all that stuff, yet everything is solved by punching people in the face. It's no different than any of the old serials (which I love)...the only difference is better costumes, nihilism and half-naked ladies. Why not try something new instead?The writing is terrible...it's embarrassing. It made me blush. The choice of music (Eminem, Queen, Ozzy Osbourne) is bizarre. The music seems out of place. None of the characters are convincing. The dancing Enchantress is probably one of the worst things ever in a comic book movie. It's almost as bad as Batman's rubber butt in Schumacher's homoerotic Batman movies. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be funny or serious, but it is beyond ridiculous.Just read or watch ""Mad Love"" instead. It's a better Batman/Harley Quinn and Joker story."
" awful, just awful.

" Bad Guys, Yes. Bad Movie, No Way!

He's not as good as Ledger but he's a very worthy successor. Excited to see more of him in the DCEU - Deadshot - Will Smith gave a fantastic performance, in fact I think this is his best movie since ""I Am Legend"" - Harley Quinn - Normally I don't like Harley Quinn. But Robbie made me like the character for the first time ever! - Captain Boomerang - This guy was hilarious! A much different take than the TV version but it worked! - Killer Croc - He came off very intimidating and was oddly hilarious in a very good way - El Diabla - Wow, did not expect to feel so much for this character. I know nothing about him in the comics but I really liked him here - The bookends - SS felt like a sequel to BvS and a prequel to Justice League, and as a big fan of cohesive universes I really liked that - Batfleck - I don't really need to say anything here, do I? - Enchantress - Her design was great and I had no clue as to her significant role in the film. It's nice to be surprised at the movies every now and thenThe Bad - There wasn't much of a story; there is about 30 minutes of setup and the rest is one long action scene (not that that's a problem, but it could have used some fleshing out) - Too many songs and not enough orchestral music - You could really tell the WB editing team took several axe strokes to the movie if the rumors are to be believedMy sheer excitement at seeing this comic realized on-screen though is really enough to help me ignore the films problems9/10 (for now, my opinions on films can change)"
" A bad movie, a masterpiece when it comes to defining characters
",2017-06-15 00:00:00,6,"This is not a good movie, the pacing feels like one long trailer and the movie overall is quite lame.But what this movie does give you: is a masterpiece when defining characters.The story was not built in the right way, but the movie did do something; it took these characters and made them in a phenomenon, ready to reappear in more DC movies along the way.The costume, make up and hair styling teams did a great job, bringing in new iconic looks to the characters.Casting was another positive point about this movie.A lot has been said about the Joker, and I don't know if the world was ready for a new Joker after Heath Ledger's performance. The choice made with bringing this new rendition of the so known and loved character will be a win for them in future movies. While we haven't seen much of him, I think Leto's Joker will grow on us overtime. They needed to redefine the Joker; as you simple can not compete will Ledger's magnetic performance."
" An absolutely terrible venture in filmmaking.
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,4,"Suicide Squad is just bad. It's really, really bad. The acting is terrible. The CGI looks awful. The pacing and story makes me wonder if they were even trying. The editing and look of the movie make me want to hurl. The first half hour is just a constant barrage of music being thrown at you, making the world's most expensive music video. However, it's pretty (unintentionally) funny to watch in bits, so its worth it for a meme with some friends but literally nothing else."
" They nailed it with Margot Robbie and failed in every other aspect
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,2,"It is actually amazing that they somehow created a phenomenon with Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and then went on to fail in every other aspect possible.I see people talking about Jared Leto being good as the Joker and also Will Smith doing a great job. Weird. Actually Jared Leto and his character are not even part of the plot and Will Smith... Well, his performance is not even relevant.It's the plot. Nothing makes sense. Just one example here: When did they become such good friends so that they can risk their lives for each other? How? Why? I'm not even gonna mention that these guys are supposed to be villains. It's the end of discussion. Extremely bad plot = bad movie.PS: Reading the trivia section full of Jared Leto antics is almost as annoying as the plot. I declare Leto as the new king of pretentiousness. Sorry Sean Penn."
" Simply Awful
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,3,"I love watching super hero movies.Sadly, the only thing worth watching in this movie is Harley Quinn's rear end. Which, oddly enough, has more time on the screen than some of the casts faces.By the end of the movie, I could understand why. It is the best part of this movie.The story falls apart before it begins, is diabolically written and ends just in time for you to not hang yourself with your own underwear.Why do they make such terrible movies? Of course, you will watch this movie anyway, because you are also a fan of comics. Like me.I wonder if anyone else thought it reminded them of the original Ghost Busters movie?"
" This is what happens when the filmmakers have zero belief in the material
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,1,"The Suicide Squad was a relatively short-lived comic book series about a bunch of B-list supervillains who reluctantly agree to work for the US government. While the movie kept that basic premise, everything else about the movie is derivative and loaded with filler. Not a single original idea or concept is brought in.The first half of the movie actually showed some promise. The appeal of the concept has always been that the supervillains were more fun than the superheroes because a) they don't play by those pesky rules of morality, b) they don't actually like each other or the people they're working for. However, the movie quickly devolves in the second half as the filmmakers try to make the characters (at least the ones they bothered to give personalities) human and sympathetic, but in the most corny and ham-fisted way possible.The biggest problem of the movie is Will Smith. They kept calling him Deadshot, but make no mistake about it, he was playing Will Smith. I don't know if the script was written with him in mind, or if they just re-wrote the part when he was cast, but it was essentially the reluctant superhero from Hancock meets the loving father from Pursuit of Happiness meets the smug hotshot from Men In Black. His performance was so out of place that it basically ruined the movie for me.In addition to bringing in Will Smith, the filmmakers brought in Jared Leto as the Joker, even though again, the performance and character had zero to do with the premise or the plot of the movie. Again, it's clear that the filmmakers had no confidence in the source material or concept and jammed in the Joker (and some cameos from Ben Afflec/Batman) as a cheap marketing gimmick.Viola Davis as Amanda Waller had some good moments but was underused, as was pretty much every character other than Deadshot and Harley Quinn. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was about the only redeeming quality of the movie.The basic plot is so simplistic, I think they ripped it off from a video game.How the movie made as much money as it did is completely baffling to me."
" Giving a 7 for you, Ms. Quinn...
",2017-06-09 00:00:00,7,"Expected to be the big break for DC comics, Suicide squad doesn't quite live up to the hype. Casting was good, especially Will Smith, but Margot Robbie was simply phenomenal. Jared Leto seemed overdone to me. In imparting a psychotic vibe to the character, Margot simply outclasses Leto. Capt Boomerang and the enchantress failed to impress. Also at times the story line seemed quite stretched and over-reliant on stories of two characters- Smith and Margot. The way the climax unraveled, and how the enchantress got unleashed, was uninspiring. Fight sequences and graphics were nothing extraordinary. Scenes like the one in bar serve just for movie promotions, and in no ways contributes to plot development.Overall, a one time watch, and but for Margot and Smith, I could have rated it a 5."
" The good & bad of Suicide Squad
",2017-06-09 00:00:00,6,"Suicide Squad is a bit of a mixed bag, it does have some entertaining moments but overall felt this movie was a bit of a let down.The good:-The performances from Margot Robbie, Jared Leto & Will smith. Jared Leto as the Joker sparked a lot of debate with his performance, I feel he did a good job and generally wanted to see more and more of him throughout the film and hope he does feature in another D.C. Film. The 'gangster' take that he took on as the joker was a unique performance & am glad he didn't try and replicate the Heath Ledger version of the Joker. Margot Robbie & Will Smith worked well together as Harley Quinn & Deadshot as the two main characters & felt that their origin stories were quite intriguing as to how they ended up in prison & came to be the way they are. -The storyline between the joker & Harley Quinn - I felt was more interesting than the actual main plot of the movie and hope this storyline between them & how the joker corrupted Harley gets explored in more detail in another movie (hopefully the Harley Quinn solo movie) -The soundtrack, most of the songs were quite good & mostly suited the mood of the film.The bad:-The main story - felt this was a bit of a let down as the squad basically just had to stop a portal in the sky which we have now seen several times in movies over the last few years e.g the avengers & TMNT-The villain - did not like Enchantress as the villain, she was way to powerful for most of them in the squad (except Diablo) & did have to question why some of them where there & to what they could actually do to stop enchantress. Felt I would have enjoyed them Going up against the joker or having someone more human like him as the villain instead.-The pacing - Went from the origin stories to all of sudden trying to stop the super powers of enchantress, felt this was brought on very suddenly & didn't allow much time to develop the characters - which leads me to.......-Supporting cast - some of the characters such as Killer Croc & Captain Boomerang, I would have liked to know more about their origin stories which perhaps could have been done in another movie. Killer Croc was very underutilized, Kitana & slipknot don't even know why they were in the movie & Rick Flag just seem to love struck by Enchantress to be the leader of the squad. Captain Boomerang however was good in the scenes he was in. Maybe I had too high hopes for this movie, after Batman vs Superman which I actually enjoyed. I would like to see a more in depth sequel to this movie or perhaps a Harley Quinn solo movie exploring more of her and the Jokers relationship & would be quite happy if Margot Robbie & Jared Leto reprise these roles."
" It was...... OK
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,6,"While this is by far not my favorite comic book movie, it is (so far) my favorite of the DCEU. The production value and most of the acting was the best I've seen thus far, but DC still has a long way to go before they can even start to compete with Marvel. The big problem with the movie is that the focus was on Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), which didn't give the rest of the characters a fair enough chance to shine. In one of the last scenes most of the Suicide Squad comes back to finish the fight with Enchantress, but none of them were given a real reason to. They were never introduced properly and there was no screen time where all the characters bonded enough to fight for one another. In reality, it felt like they just said, ""fuck it, might as well fight."" The one thing Suicide Squad did well is show the relationship between Harley Quinn (Robbie) and The Joker (Jared Leto). I know a lot of people had a problem with Leto's interpretation of Joker, but the scenes that had Harley and Joker together were by far the best in the movie. They had just the right balance between telling you how they got there, and mystery of why it happened in the first place. Overall, I think this was a good effort by DC and Warner Bros., and I think it's a good sign of what's to come."
" Never been so disappointed in my entire life
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,1,"Wow! So bad! Everything from the acting to the script was terrible. I have looked forward to this movie since it was announced. Epic songs dough, but they managed to f--k that up as well due to the bad timing and frequency. I don't even understand how the director David Ayer dared to begin the distribution with this time-waster. DON'T WATCH!"
" Harley Quinn Saves the Day
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,5,"Without the character of Harley Quinn and the fine performance of Margot Robbie Suicide Squad would be - extremely boring, with Harley Quinn it is just boring. Everything in this movie is just plain from the textbook of making a superhero movie, it is almost like this movie is another cell of a life form called the D.C.-Marvel-virus. The problem: the virus spreads and produces more and more cells but the quality of the cells is getting worse.Suicide Squad gets a rate of 5 from me, without Margot Robbie's fine performance I would rate it 3 and here I am dead serious. This movie is predictable like an Emmerich movie. Word's Autosearch-Function wrote the script I would bet.Final words: Maybe watchable and collectible for hardcore fans of the superhero-cosmos, for everyone else - expect the expected."
" The most ridiculous movie ever?
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,4,"I get it, This is comic book stuff, But come on, should it be that far fetched? As a DC fan I really hoped for this to be better, and I actually liked the 2 Superman movies of the DCEU despite what the critics said, but this one big plot-hole of a movie is too much even for me. Jared Leto is absolutely magnetizing as the Joker, and I could even fall for his and Harley's love story, but it feels like Ayer was interested so much in making this movie different, colorful and psychedelic, that he gave up any plausibility or realism, hence the beautiful but silly scene in which they dive into rainbow coloured chemicals. And anyway, you can sell us that a suicide squad of this sort would include Deadshot, El Diablo or the other dangerous criminals with special expertise, but what makes Harley Queen qualify for Task Force X more than any trained soldier? And let's say for some reason her madness makes her an especially ruthless warrior, why on earth would they send her to battlefield with that cheeky outfit and a... baseball club? Deadshot's arc with the lovable Will Smith and the little daughter story was almost compelling, until when the witch offers everyone to fulfill their deepest wish, and he dreams about killing Batman instead of being with his daughter again. I could go on, but to sum it up, this has some great talent and great CGI, and it's certainly different than other comics movies we've seen, but it's silliness makes it hard to really enjoy it."
" DC is almost there
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,6,"Reason one to watch this movie: just for the fun of it!! The movie is really entertaining and has good humor scenes. But, if you are looking for another Marvel movie, this is not it. This is DC, and it's time that people are aware of it, although comparisons are in order, as always. The movie has rhythm and good action scenes, but at some times the plot is weak, there is nothing new there that could be given to the audience. Nonetheless, that doesn't mean that you won't enjoy it, because you do. And if you didn't like BvS, you will probably like this one better as the story flows faster and is less darker.Reason two: Harley Quinn. Maybe the most popular character in the movie; even more than the Joker, who by the way, is NOT a part of the squad, so don't expect him to appear that much in the movie. She is his girlfriend, and probably she is even crazier than him. Every time that we hear Margot Robbie speak, she really steals the show; she is simply the best with her performance of the crazy girlfriend. One cannot help themselves to look for more information about her and check the Batman animated movies (guilty here).Reason three: the music. The soundtrack is one of the best things about this movie. Old known songs, and not so old, that will transport you to another time while you enjoy the action in the movie. The best example of it the first movie trailer, which got us hooked since the first second. If there was an Oscar category for trailers, this one would definitely take it home."
" The only villain in here is the movie itself
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,5,"It's only the 3rd movie in the cinematic universe and DC has found a new low. Instead of trying to remove the heat created by the controversial responses to their previous movie with a proper live- action adaptation of Green Lantern or any other iconic superhero, They chose to do this. A movie about assembling a team of super villains to stop another super villain from destroying the humanity. This does sound interesting until you actually watch the movie and realise that if the US government really wanted to save the humanity, all they had to do was to NOT assemble this team.In a world where batman, wonder woman and flash already exists, the only way to protect the country is the Suicide Squad. An all villain/anti-hero team consisting of a marksman, a girl with a baseball bat, a guy with a boomerang, a guy who can shoot fire from his bare hands and transform into a giant fire monster, a Japanese lady with a sword,a guy who can climb anything(Seriously ? this guy ?), a half man-half crocodile person and a witch awakened by probably the world worst archaeologist ever. Yup. They totally doesn't match with each other or to stop any actual threat. but the director tries really hard to convince us otherwise by having them fight faceless CGI creatures that poses no threat to even Harley Quinn or capt. Boomerang of all people. The fights are poorly executed and doesn't have any real stakes. there is absolutely nothing to make us feel that we should care about these characters either. They just get together, go to some place, take down all the CGI creatures, move to another place, take down all the CGI creatures and keep doing that until they find the big bad guy and defeat him in on of the most dullest final battles in film history. That's it. there's nothing good to be taken from this movie except the great performances by Will smith, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis that aren't enough to save this movie."
" Flashy but lifeless DC Comics adaptation
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,2,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The Earth is under attack from an intergalactic life force that wants to take over. Government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) suggests an unlikely idea: to battle with such a deadly and unfair force, they must assemble a team of super villains who play by their own rules, including assassin Deadshot (Will Smith), super minx Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and her lover The Joker (Jared Leto), and release them from prison to take down the threat. This, of course, does not go entirely to plan, and as well as dealing with the force, they must also rescue Doctor Jane Moone (Cara Delevinge) from the clutches of the Enchantress, an evil entity that has taken over her.While Marvel certainly seems to hold the reigns over the superhero movie franchise, DC Comics are more than capable of flashing their weight, with a number of glossy big screen adaptations of their most popular characters, where their virtuous, emboldened personas are projected into the product to heightened effect. With Suicide Squad, director David Ayer has attempted to flip this on its head, and instead give us a group of anti heroes with attitude and much less moral fibre. It's definitely a colourful, flashy piece, but sadly, the end result is just a complete mess.It's going for a loud, funky style, yet it's shot in a surprisingly grey and dour manner throughout, like it's trying to capture the spirit of the righteous comic book adaptations it was selling itself as the antidote to. Yet the worst thing is just the complete lack of any discernible, coherent plot to keep you interested. The complete premise seems to be sold on what would happen if a bunch of bad guys were sent to battle a super-threat, but this is not a strong enough foundation on which to set up a film in itself, and it shows.Performances wise, Smith virtually plays the wise-cracking wise-ass in his sleep, yet he still feels unsuited and misplaced playing an all out villain as opposed to just a maverick good guy, while as one of the main villains, Delevinge is just a terrible actress and should really just go back to the catwalk. Leto's Joker is certainly different, but not much of an impression otherwise. Robbie's sassy Harley Quinn is probably the best thing about it.Just a big, colourful, garish mess, really, and a wasted opportunity. *"
" Much better than all other comic book movies. Feels genuine rather than having childish jokes
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,9,"I wasn't expecting much when i watched this but i loved it. Whereas other comic book movies these days have baby jokes in the middle of intense action scenes (duh that doesn't even happen in real life), this movie looks much more realistic because it has a dark component. Wayyyyy better than all the avengers or guardians of galaxy crap"
" ""Suicide Squad""- Another misfire for the struggling DCEU, though it is not without its moments. Entertaining but woefully messy.
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,5,"There comes a certain point where as fans, we need to stop the squabbling, in-fighting and blame-throwing and face the bottom line. It's a tough pill to swallow, but it needs to be said- as it stands, the DC Extended Universe is failing. From the mediocrity and bizarre dreariness of ""Man of Steel"", through the intolerably disjointed and obnoxious ""Batman V Superman"", to the patchy filmmaking of ""Suicide Squad""... things are not looking good. And the worst part is the excuses and denial. I've seen it time and again. Justification for the sub-par storytelling and hackneyed direction... excuses for the complete lack of character motivation and humanity... dismissal of any criticism no matter how constructive it may be... all because people are too in love with these characters to admit that something is critically wrong. People... something is wrong. Very wrong. And we need to admit it, whether you like it or not.""Suicide Squad"" is the third entry in DC's growing cinematic universe. And while it may not quite falter and fall as flat as 2016's other major release in the franchise (""Batman V Superman""), it still stands as merely a blaring example of mediocrity. Obviously butchered by re-shoots and re-edits and lacking a strong narrative cohesion, it may very well be an entertaining and sometimes thrilling experience, but it's a very troubled on. But hey... at least it's kinda fun to watch.In a refreshingly straightforward tale, ""Suicide Squad"" follows the assembly of a task-force made up of various imprisoned super- villains and criminals, including the reptilian ""Killer Croc"" (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), pyrokinetic ""El Diablo"" (Jay Hernandez), conflicted mercenary ""Deadshot"" (Will Smith), mouthy crook ""Captain Boomerang"" (Jai Courtney) and the lover of the legendary clown prince of crime, Harley Quinn. (Margot Robbie) When one of the team's recruits- the incredibly powerful ""Enchantress"" (Cara Delevingne)- goes rogue and threatens to destroy the world, it's up to the bad-guys to save the day. ...oh, and I guess there's some stuff in there with Jared Leto as ""The Joker"", but it doesn't really matter.The big problem here is that the film has a lot of potential that feels lost at the hands of a director sloppily trying to juggle several different tonalities and a studio trying to make the film as widely appealing as possible by sheepishly cutting around the more challenging scenes and throwing in pandering references for hardcore fans that come off as contrived and irritating. It's no secret that there was a great deal of behind-the-scenes drama with re-edits and re-shoots galore, with the studio going so far as to hire a trailer-editing company to do their own cut of the film to make it faster and more similar to one of the more popular previews... and oh boy, do these production troubles rear their head often. The pacing and focus is a complete mess much of the time and the film rockets by many key scenes with all the grace of a tap-dancer on a greased floor, leaving the viewer too often lost in the shuffle even with a relatively standard and predictable story. This isn't helped by the painfully generic ""gritty"" guidance from writer/director David Ayer, who is so focused on shaky camera-work, aesthetically ""dark"" visuals and general bland ""ugliness"" that you might actually stop and ask yourself if you somehow wandered into a Rob Zombie film. I'm sorry, but I've just about had it with these falsely manufactured ""gritty"" films where it goes so far over the top with its style that it becomes laughable and cringe-worthy. If its to the service of nothing but self-indulgence and a misguided attempt at being ""edgy"", it's not innovation... it's tedium. I'm not saying you can't make a gritty film... I'm saying you have to make it right. And this just feels ridiculous. Do we really need a Joker covered in High School goth tattoos, a Harley Quinn with smudged makeup and fishnets and a villain who is so ""evil"" that her henchmen are literally made of anthropomorphic grime? It's forced.But at the same time... I'd be lying if I said I didn't have some fun with the film, and can see hints of brilliance desperately clawing beneath the surface. So I can't say the film is a total loss. Outside of a woefully miscast and sometimes painful to watch Jared Leto, the rest of the cast shines. (And that's all the mention Leto will get, as he's barely in the movie as has been stated over and over.) Particularly Robbie, who is a complete joy despite being over-sexualized way too often. She's a ton of fun and I could see her being phenomenal in the role in future installments. I also quite admired Will Smith and even the absolutely delightful Viola Davis, who appears in a supporting role. And hey... the movie even made me like Jai Courtney! And that's nothing to sneeze at, as he's usually the cinematic kiss of death. The action can be very thrilling and there's some great effects work being done both digitally and with its award-winning makeup. Some of the jokes land well, and there's a few genuinely great sequences peppered in. And hey, even if I hate his work in the majority of the film, Ayer does have some very creative visuals up his sleeve that pop up now and again.It comes down to this. If you're looking for the film to redeem the struggling DC Extended Universe, this sadly isn't it. It has potential, and it's arguably the best of the three thus-far released. But it has many problems all its own. However, if you're looking for some mindless fun with some good action, a couple of laughs and a few great performances, it won't disappoint. I just firmly believe that we need to put the pressure on the studio-suits and push them to do better work. DC deserves better.I give ""Suicide Squad"" an average 5 out of 10."
" Not what I expected
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,5,"This was one of the biggest entertainment wet sandwiches of recent times for me. The highlights... Harley Quinn...she played her role very well. Crazy, sexy, flirty. I would have liked a few more comments about the Joker. I wanted some of the traditional talk, traditional names she has for the Joker. But overly, I thought this portrayal was good. Joker...I think I liked him. The trailers and the talk made it sound like this was going to be a new spin on a famous recipe, but this joker was just parsley on my plate. I cant even say I want more. I never really got a taste..however, what I did see did look like a new recipe. I guess I must have got my order wrong.Thats it...all the highlightsThe film was afraid to live on the characters. Instead it tried to live off of WIll SMITH. It was Will being Will and that was our highlight and it sucked. I am surprised they didn't have Will getting Harley. If I wanted to see an unbelievable movie about Will Smith where he gets to be witty, I have a pile of them. To me this movie is about the characters and not a popular actor. I cant remember much more than I have typed. The main reason I remember Will is because it was that bad. Like a hair in your soup, you remember that"
" What were you all expecting?
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,8,"It is definitely not as bad as many of the reviews I have read. I own the extended addition and it is the first version that I watched.I didn't come into this film expecting a Nolan-style character piece or a mastery of modern cinema or Oscar bait. I came in with three expectations: 1 - That the had both action and comedy 2 - That the characters felt right 3 - That when it was over I was satisfied and had funThe film accomplished all of those in my opinion. Many of the reviews state that they couldn't care about the characters in the film. I disagree with that, as anyone who has real issues in their life can easily relate to Deadshot, Harley, and even Diablo's situations. The main characters have their flaws and mistakes, and the film showed that well if you bothered to pay attention. They were villains true but they were people too. The action was also fun too, a lot of shooting, magic, and smashing. Good stuff. And comedy was sprinkled throughout gave quick laughs that felt right with some of the unhinged characters. The main bad guys weren't anything too special true, but it is a superhero movie...all bad guys have their clichés.If you came in expecting super high brow entertainment with mastery writing and Oscar performances galore you were bound to be disappointed. It's not that kinda movie. I was hoping for a fun B movie action comedy with crazy characters that I could enjoy, and I was happily satisfied at the end."
" Not good
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,4,I am genuinely shocked that the rating fir this is so high. The soundtrack is pretty good. The story is so bad and lacking. A few good acting performances half saved it but the dodgy plot that doesn't really follow the comics left me upset. Maybe i am just an aficionado for comic series but i think the 7 out if 10 this got is far too high.
" not a movie
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,1,"From wikipedia: ""a secret government agency led by Amanda Waller recruits imprisoned supervillains to execute dangerous black ops missions and save the world from a powerful threat, in exchange for reduced sentences.""That's not a story. That's a marketing blurb. It seems most of the creators' effort is put into the teaser posters for the next dozen sequels.This movie fails the rule of cool."
" Wasted Potential
",2017-05-22 00:00:00,6,"I'm not sure if this includes spoilers so I clicked that it did, just in case something I say is considered a spoiler, though I will try to avoid any.The first and biggest problem with this is the writing. The dialogue is often hokey, and humor falls flat, and the story makes little to no sense. I understand the plot is contrived to get these bad guys together to fight a common enemy. But the pacing is all over, and the villain and her/their scheme is never fully explained.The second big problem is the direction. Some scenes are in dramatic slow motion for no reason and undermine the action and pacing. Other scenes that could have been interesting or exciting are rushed or never even shown. Good direction could have helped cover up a lot of the story's flaws. Instead it exacerbated them.The third big problem, and I guess this still goes along with the writing and plot but stood out to me as a separate problem, the combination of the characters never makes sense. Okay, we get it. They are meta-humans brought together to fight potential meta-human threats. However, some are obviously much more useful than others. Why was Harley Quinn even there? Deadshot kills everything quickly while her and others have hand-held weapons. It makes little sense. At least the alligator dude gets to use his talent later in the story, but for the most part they could have just taken Deadshot, no need for the whole crew.There are a few good points that make this movie worth watching.The actors do the best they can with an inconsistent and disappointing script. Margot Robbie is a believable Harley Quinn unfortunately she's just there for eye candy, contrived emotion, and one-liners that don't land. Will Smith is, well, Will Smith as he is in every movie and does it justice. I have mixed feelings about Jared Leto's joker; on one hand, he is a delightfully psychotic, and somewhat fresh, original twist on the joker. On the other hand his performance is also as inconsistent as the script. Early on, I was digging the character even if it took a minute to get used to after seeing actors like Caesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, and Heath Ledger do him differently. But some of his later scenes seemed forced, like he was trying to hard. He delves into a Christian Bale-like guttural voice at times that seemed unnecessary. Overall the actors do the best they can with the script and deserve credit.If you can turn off your brain and just enjoy the action and attempts at humor, there is value here. Unfortunately, its potential is wasted by the script as I've said before. A better story, villain, and direction could have made this something special."
" ""Don't forget, we're the bad guys.""
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,7,"I held off watching this flick for the primary reason that I thought it would be more like ""Deadpool"", with liberal use of the 'F' word and an unhealthy balance of sex and violence for a comic book based movie. So the good surprise here is that the DC folks didn't further lower the bar on entertainment value by going for the cheap and nasty.On the flip side though, the story falls victim to that ever present need to fill the screen with the most over the top action sequences the film makers can to rid the world of the latest all powerful villain menace bent on dominating the planet. It gets so repetitious after a while that it almost legislates against seeing the next picture to come out because you know it will just be more of the same.Taken individually, I did get a kick out of the principal players. Margot Robbie's take on Harley Quinn and Jared Leto's portrayal of The Joker were about the best one could expect of actors who have mentally challenged characters to portray. It's interesting to contrast Leto's Joker with Heath Ledger's in ""The Dark Knight"". Ledger's was more of an extremist, almost a terrorist one might say, whereas Leto came at the character as someone who was deranged. I didn't think anyone could top Ledger's performance as The Joker at the time, but Leto's performance now gives me pause.As for the rest, the remaining meta-humans to join the Squad were OK, but there wasn't much time to focus on their characters with Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn doing most of the heavy lifting. As for squad leader Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), he seemed almost superfluous except for his connection to June Moone/The Enchantress (Cara Deleningne). The ease with which Harley managed to fake out Enchantress and steal her heart seemed like a total let down with global domination at stake. Same thing with Incubus, a potential bad guy with the power of a Superman, yet he got dusted by a fiery opponent and blown up. Doesn't say much for world threatening super-villains.Well it's a been there, done that viewing for me and I'd like to be a bit more positive about the picture but it was just something to get out of the way. The after credit scene didn't much inspire to see the follow up sequel, if in fact there is one. Judging by the amount of negative reviews on this board, there might be reason to reconsider."
" Top actors in ""B"" movie
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,2,"A lot of good actors obviously needed some extra cash because for the life of me I can see no other reason they appeared in this drivel. A script that is so bad as to be laughable and looked like it had been written by a computer that was badly programmed. And yet it's is the work of David Ayer who wrote the screenplay for Training Day!? So is this just a one off case of writer's block? Let's hope so.Cliché after cliché and a set of characters that were so poor that any actor that appeared in this tosh will have to do something sensational to recover their reputations. Mind you considering the rubbish that's produced currently, appearing in this ridiculous movie may not be a problem.So were there any redeeming aspects to this movie? Not really although the special effects were OK. The music made it seem like a series of music videos that were separated by a music score. So many disappointments and yet it's made $745.6 million at the box office. I think that says an awful lot about the standard of publicity than it does about the standard of this movie."
" Watchable if you reduce your expectations to 0
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,6,"If you didn't watch the movie just because there are many negative critics, the actual movie won't be as bad as it seems. The first problem of this movie was the big hype just like in every DCEU movie. So while watching the movie just don't expect anything.What I really loved about the movie was the performance of everyone. Especially Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Will Smith as Deadshot made some boring phases watchable. This interpretation of Joker was very different from all the other Joker's we've seen. Still it wasn't bad and Jared Leto made the best of it. Now when it comes to negative points there are many small factors. One would be that there hasn't been much process during the story. The plot didn't use the full potential. Also it was difficult to relate to some characters, because the background of the characters weren't really ""shown"". They were more like ""told"" to the audience. Another reason for that would be that the mood was changed so fast so you couldn't feel with the characters. Despite of the first few minutes cinematography wasn't really creative. And while the selection of the songs were good, this movie could have really need some more dramatic background score. All in all, it's watchable, if you just try to get enjoyed by the performances."
" The dirty crew
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,5,"I think I saw this film many years ago. It was called The Dirty Dozen and it had a more coherent plot.Suicide Squad is a combination of bad asses from the world of DC comics as intelligence operative Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembles a team of meta-humans, that is humans with some superpowers to defend the world the next time the world encounters a villain with the powers that Superman has. I think Waller describes a situation of who would save the world if someone took the roof of the White House and entered the Oval Office, which is exactly what happened in Superman II.The Suicide Squad consists of Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). To keep them in check is Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) who is also seeking to rescue his lover Dr June Moone who is possessed by the evil Enchantress (Cara Delevingne.)Everyone has a back story but the film concentrates mainly on Deadshot and Harley Quinn with the Joker (Jared Leto) popping in as a strategic and unfunny guest villain.The story is a bit of a mess with a weak plot and most of the action located on a sound stage shot at night time. You know this group of bad people will defy authority, plan to escape and eventually bond to take on the villains which seems to be some kind of CGI monsters who conveniently get shot, slashed, banged or knocked out by a baseball bat. Some of the anti heroes do not have super powers at all but people like Diablo or Killer Croc do.Although I admire Leto's take on the Joker, he was messily written and I expected silly humour from him which was non existent here.Still Warner Brother's have learned from Marvel and included an eclectic soundtrack, they have at least made the film entertaining. I just think their world of heroes lacked the cohesiveness that Marvel have achieved and this is mainly down to a sub par screenplay."
" This movie is a waste of time
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,4,"This movie was one of my most anticipated films of 2016. Unfortunately, I never got around to watch it when it came out originally. Months later, I finally got the opportunity to view it; I wish I hadn't. The movie has a very nice cast: Will Smith, Jared Leto, Margot Robbie. Jared Leto's Joker felt very out of place and unimportant. He's only the movie for 12 minutes and he always felt forced. He just seemed too goofy and childish to actually be the Joker. Will Smith's Deadshot was probably the best performance, but even he seemed restricted in certain scenes. I don't know if it was the dialogue that he was given by the director or if he just wasn't feeling the character, but he would come across as uninspired during the later half of the movie. The main villain is predictable as hell as well. The entire plot could have been prevented if one lady was consistent with the ""stern vigilance"" her character was associated with, but she decides to be sloppy for seemlingly no reason. The plot is also goofy, with the final boss fight being extremely lackluster and unsatisfying. The only reason this movie isn't a complete bomb is because their are a few funny scenes (although all of them aren't intentional) and the universe itself it still fairly interesting. With that being said, you'd find more enjoyment reading the comics than watching the movie."
" Evil villains unite
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,8,"Evil villain heros save the world!Yep. Villain mash up across the board. And it's beautiful. Entertaining, great music choices, comedy, romance . I enjoyed the back stories of the characters as well. Maybe not the best super hero movie but it was entertaining. If you can't handle comedy, sarcasm, explosions, bad guys, villains /heros, magic, deception or plot twists then maybe you should rent a care bear movie and take a seat.great fun movie that nearly the whole family can enjoy!"
" Not as bad as you think.
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,5,"DC movies get a bad rap in today's movie market. When Marvel has won over the majority of peoples taste and perception, I feel a bias can be made from the ""to like one you have to dislike the other"" mentality. Is Suicide as awful as they say?No it's not. I enjoyed for what it had to offer. And what it offered to me is an early example of what DC can do if they don't shoot themselves in the foot. I know DC comics. I've read a majority of their titles over the years. The Suicide Squad is a B-list/D-list title for villains. And DC has great villains(hence why Harley/Deadshot/Joker were the selling point). DC has an unlimited amount of content to take from but they seem to hire writers or staff that don't know or obtuse to the library of DC. Now, I'm not going to fanboy over this film. It was flawed in many ways. And the Joker(portrayed by Leto) was completely underused and thrown under the bus. That's not good to do to your talented actor. The editing was choppy, and the sequence somewhere a 3/4th's into the film is random and rushed(edited by a trailer crew).The other problem is the script. Whoever green lit a script that was complete in three weeks, needs to find another profession because that is not ample time to make a good film or any film in general.David Ayer does deserve some credit. His choice of costumes and colors is an upgrade from the dower dry and gray BvS. All in all I enjoyed it... For what it was. Take that for what it is worth."
" Not too bad but come one, there's stuff missing
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,6,"I liked the film and never knew anything about the characters. One of the biggest problems with the story is that there aren't enough backstory for Captain Boomerang and Killer Croc. They are good characters but we needed to know their history! Especially if you aren't familiar with the characters. The main baddie kinda through me off, like it was two different universes, becoming one."
" Nice surprise
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,8,How do you make a movie with a bunch of villains instead of superheroes and expect to be cheering for them like you would any superhero? Well Suicide Squad does exactly that with an unbelievable mix of some of the most ruthless villains from DC comics. The cast was exceptional and very entertaining with Will Smith and Margot Robbie who plays Harley Quinn and pulled off a fantastic job playing the Joker's queen of chaos. The story was good and the action was awesome. People should never listen to the hype of any movie. I didn't and I went in to this with no expectations. With so many comic book movies out there I was not expecting to be entertained as much as I was watching this. What a fun fantastic idea to bring the villains together to save the world. Very unique and well written. This is one movie that can be watched again and again. You have your Justice League and your Avengers but with the Suicide Squad you have a group that you never know what to expect. They are totally different and that's what makes them and this movie fun fun fun.
" A group of unlikely comic characters save the world
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,10,Very good for the first superhero(or super villain) movie with the main stars being a woman and a man of color. I would defiantly watch again . I especially enjoyed the character origin stories with the modern look to the transitions between the characters . I loved how we finally got the other side of the story the villains and how they used some lesser known villains who have never been in the movies.
" Almost as disappointing as getting no presents for Christmas!
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,4,"Suicide Squad Oh boy, so where do I start with this one? Imagine being a child on Christmas morning hoping that Santa had left you a new bicycle only to find that instead you had been gifted with a nice large lump of coal! That was the immense disappointment i felt after watching this movie. The build up, the teasers, the promising cast. The acclaimed director... Then the eventual end product. A miss mash of ideas. The stupid storyline, the choppy editing. Suicide Squad is all of the above things and more. A wasted opportunity. Such a great concept. The most notorious villains forced to work together to save the world. I won't go into too much about the storyline but I will say it's ludicrous! Giving the rag tag team a real world situation to deal with would have been a much more satisfying movie. I understand that the whole idea is that the world needs an extraordinary set of people to deal with extraordinary threats. But this was like some Ghostbusters spoof made by fanboys. It was hollow. Forgettable and poorly made. No matter how much CGI polish is sprayed on to the movie screen it can't hide this. The villains look as though they were lifted from an old episode of the Power Rangers. All costumed up with tinsel and plastic. Cara Delevingne's Enchantress goes from looking like a belly dancer who has fallen on hard times to some sort of evil sorceress. I swear she spent the second half of the movie looking like she was hula hooping or that someone had poured ants down the back of her knickers. She does this weird twisting and contorting throughout the film which becomes really annoying. The cast though is the saving grace of this movie. Margot Robbie is absolutely superb as Harley Quinn as is Jared Leto's brief appearance as the Joker. I say brief. Don't go into this movie thinking you're going to see a Joker filled fun fest. He gets about as much screen time as Godzilla did in his recent outing. Will Smith as Deadshot is Will Smith playing Will Smith as usual. However he does bring a level of charisma to the movie like only he can. Joel Kinnaman is as robotic as he was in Robocop. Leaving Jai Courtney to challenge Margot Robbie for the scene stealer award. There's an encounter or two with The Batman. Ben Affleck is filling the shoes of Christian Bale as best he can. There's also a dude who looks like a crocodile which sucks for him. The movies climax is really poor as are many a scene that give the impression that they were just tagged on Examples being Harley's elevator fight and the bar room scene. I really didn't like this film and I am a fan of the genre. Movies like the Avengers, The Dark Knight and Logan show what can be done with a good script, good director and a talented bunch of actors. This movie had two out of three of those but fails miserably. Too many moments that leave you tutting at the screen. One example when all The Suicide Squad are battling the Enchantress. She gets caught up in a fist fight only to the say ""Enough!"" and magically disarms them all. If she's so powerful why would she lower herself to the level of bar room brawling? I could go on but I'll just come out and say it. This film was crap! A real disappointment. DC you are going to have to up your game big time. Compared to the quality of the movies Marvel are making you have a long long way to go."
" A a missed opportunity
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,4,"It's so shame that this movie does not seem to be anything. It has one of the weakest story lines I have ever seen. The only thing that succeeded is the good performances, and the makeup and hair-styling where it also received an Acedemy Award. You can not blame David Ayer, assuming he only got 7 weeks from Warner Bros. To create the script. The script is actually ""good"" to be written in 7 weeks. What also immediately shows that this movie is a cash grab. I definitely don't recommend watching this movie if you are a fan or an average movie viewer because for both, this movie is not pleasant to watch."
" it's a movie
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,3,"it's a will smith movie, with will smith, portraying a action will smith version killer, but its just a normal will smith version you'll notice, so it's just will smith being will smith in a will smith movie...plus other actors, plus ""plot"""
" A horrible production that serves as prevention
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,1,"This film was supposed to be the salvation of the decadent DCEU (with just three films), however, only served to sink it more.How to start? Not only is it painfully written, but also horribly directed and that same makes the actors do a very bad job.The mistakes of the script of the film range from introducing anti-climatic and really forced jokes to errors of continuity, coherence, and cohesion. From the beginning of the film we began to see these problems, with the introduction of the characters and history (which finds its purpose until after an hour of suffering). It is at this point that, in addition to the purpose is unclear, the villain introduced is equally trash as the story of the film. A cliché villain easily defeated that only serves for ... really nothing. It serves the easy plot to have a villain who wants to conquer everything and after a battle with ""pium-pium"" and explosions and the destruction of the city and more stupid formula of an average superhero movie, is defeated.The characters have no chemistry between them. The team was formed very quickly and in this way as fast as any other mediocre film, they want to make us believe that they have very great emotional ties and are now ""family"" when they are people who met about two hours before and plus, threatened to work together.The attempt to make it ""funny"" but at the same time something dark and exciting means that instead of experiencing emotion and grace you experience pity for how horrible the script is, its performances and the way in which the action scenes are assembled. Not even the sound mix and the editing are good. The songs are put at the worst moment in the film, just to say ""oh, what a good soundtrack, you know, the old is cool"", but instead you wonder why that song sounds at that moment and you think it's the worst song For the worst moment. Summary: ""Suicide Squad"" is not only horrible in script and production, it is equally horrible in direction, technical and artistic aspects and gives us a cliché story with unbearable characters but this time, worse worked than a B- class movie. The only thing this film serves for is to alert the directors and producers of this genre of how not to do things and makes me miss the money I paid for the entrance of the cinema."
" Just a collection of one-liners.
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,5,"Suicide squad is the one thing that is probably the worst thing for any movie to be – boring. It is made up of a few punch lines, a few clever one-liners and a lot of clichés. It is also cheap. The Enchantress' (probably expensive) CGI scenes are kept to a minimum, while the movie basically unfolds with a lot of talking and action scenes which are mostly made up of combat between actors in normal clothing and stunts in rubber suits – wow awesomeThe movie's ""ethic"" dilemmas are also ridiculous, corny and nothing new, the plot has zero twist, the entire thing flows from beginning to end as expected, right down to the survival of ""the guy's sweetheart that was trapped in the witch's body"". The brewing Japanese woman with a katana is present, the gaudy Australian with his overplayed accent is present, the crazy girl in shorts holding a baseball bat is present, the friendly monster is present, the assassin who loves his daughter is present; everything exactly as expected. A whole lot of cast spent for a whole lot of nothing. Avoid with prejudice or watch it playing in the background while you are looking for the best deal on a 100-men's sock pack on Amazon."
" Don't watch it, DC lied that its good
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,4,"When I saw the first trailer for this movie, I loved it so much that it made me want to go see it opening night. I can't believe I waited a whole year for this stupid movie. And I'm really mad that I wasted my money on this movie. Doctor Strange and Rogue One are way better then this movie.And even though Suicide Squad won a Oscar, the Oscars are pretty terrible now."
" Suicide Script
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,1,"After several viewings I have to admit that this is the most uncomfortably awful movie I have seen in a long time.The first half of this film felt like a compilation of shorts about each character carelessly thrown together like fan-fiction on YouTube. This is made worse by the fact that the makers of this film felt the need to shoehorn poorly fitting pop culture songs into every character introduction in an attempt to mask the cringe-worthy dialogue and forced humor. The second half of the film is a mindless snooze-fest almost completely void of logic or reason. The villain is unbearable, the characters empty, and the dialogue actually gets worse.I applaud DC for taking the risk of making a film about bad guys playing the good guy role, but unfortunately the final product is shockingly bad. The cast did their best with the blunt and broken tools they were given to make this film work and I hope this doesn't put a dent in any of their careers as a result."
" Suicide watch...
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,1,"There was a time (for me) when a darkened movie house offered Sanctuary from The Real World and all its attendant Horrors; when refuge could be found in Alternate Realities, from the Old West to the depths of Deep Space. Prior to my discovery of alternatives Cinematic, I found escape in the pages of comic books. One eventually gave way to the other, and these days the two are as One. Sorta. For some reason, however, movies these days tend to be far, far LESSER than the comics that inspired them. An odd dichotomy, especially when one takes into account the basic Visual Nature of both. You know the movie's in trouble when a gun-wielding character called ""Deadshot"" can't even put a round through one of the eye-holes or even the unprotected lower half of Batman's face-mask. Later, in a totally pointless (not to mention gratuitously extended) scene, we see this ""dead-eye Dick"" blasting away with an arsenal of firearms. While I'm sure there were weapons enthusiasts who got off on this scene, for the rest of us, there was nothing much going on (a lot of noise, but little else). There are so many such instances throughout this stinker that it's nigh impossible to list them all (so I'm not even going to try). It IS interesting to note that the money-man behind this one was The Foreclosure King himself (Mnuchin the Money Munchkin), whose greatest claim to fame is that he once foreclosed on a 90-year old woman who failed to pay something like 25 CENTS on her mortgage."
" Absolutely terrible
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,5,"This was a mess of a film, a travesty. I do not know where to begin because so many things do not work and make this film fly. Will Smith does all he can to carry this movie. The plot was weak and hard to buy into. One of the biggest problems is the squad themselves. It's like they decided to put together the most unimpressive and dull creatures in one team. Was there a half crocodile half man? Seriously? Katana also shows up and barely utters a word, it was like they added too many useless members to the squad. Each one was more unimpressive than the other. The villain was also equally bad and it was one train wreck after another. The scenario where the squad who is made up of bad guys forced to go after a mistake that the good guys made in the first place was just too hard to buy into and poorly sold. This is storytelling at its worst. Everyone also looked forward to Jared Leto's Joker who gave a weird and mediocre portrayal of the joker. It was so unimpressive and sad to watch, he was given little screen time but if they cut him out it would have not made a difference. This movie is not recommended but I do recommend that Zac Snyder be prevented from having any involvement in superhero movies. Each one is a train wreck and disappointing a number of fans across the globe."
" Big Budget and Star Power...
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,4,"This movie goes to prove that with all the big budgets and star power... movies can still turn out to be awfully terrible; just as it also goes to show that with all the bad reviews and comments, a bad movie can still make a lot of money with young and contented audiences.I give it a 4 out of 10, just because I like Viola Davis and Margot Robbie.By the way, this will not be watched again... ever!"
" Suicide Club.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,4,"Spending a week taking care of ill family members,I decided to say thanks to a friend for helping out by getting them some beers and a DVD. Recently learning that she has been catching up on Will Smith's old movies on Netflix UK,I decided to get her Smith's most recent blockbuster,which led to me joining the Suicide Squad.
View on the film:Gathering up a group of Punk outcasts,the screenplay by writer/director David Ayer pulls the strings down on the unique elements of each Squad member,to instead trap them in a vague race against time adventure,with the bare minimum of Comic-Book pulp.With the studio not building a background to the Squad in solo flicks,Ayer spends the opening on the origins back to back,which ends up making them each just feel like another cog in the franchise.Whilst the soundtracks strays on the misjudged,director Ayer & cinematographer Roman Vasyanov display the pulp comic/animated roots of the characters in an eye-catching fashion of grubby spandex,from Harley Quinn's naughty,but nice suggestive costume,to the mighty roar of Killer Croc.Extensively re-filmed, Ayer makes the production issues all too visible,as would-be action set-pieces are covered in a dark blue which adds to the vagueness of the mission,and saturated coloured flashbacks are randomly chucked in,that feel like a last ditch shot at giving the gang members some background.Going ""method"" for the movie, Jared Leto makes his Joker be a street ""gangsta"",whose silver gums and tattoos are symbols of his street cred,and not a psychological component to the character.Joined by a welcomed,wise-cracking Will Smith as Deadshot, sexy Margot Robbie steals the movie with a baseball bat attack as Harley Quinn,with Robbie tangling the dangerously playful Punk wild card edge of Quinn,with an underlying,quick-witted side of making sure the Suicide Squad don't join the suicide club."
" A cash grab at it's worst
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,1,"Let me start by saying that Suicide Squad is the worst comic book movie in existence. Poor writing, improper acting, flat and stupid jokes render this movie as nothing more than a silly cash grab . Spoilers ahead. Let us start with the plot. First we get an hour of improperly placed flashbacks which are absolutely of no use to the plot. After the introduction of Squad members we get an hour of Suicide Squad meets the Walking dead, with brainless action of Squad members facing weird goons. The movie focuses so much on Deadshot and Harley that it could be called Deadshot, Harley and some others. I say 'some others' as the movie treats all other squad members except El Diablo as red shirts who serve no purpose other than making crony statements. Other squad members could very well be replaced by common soldiers and it would make no difference to the plot. Diablo is perhaps the only member who has any importance in moving the plot forward but he gets very little screen time to make his character interesting. His entire arc is as follows. Gets forced to go on mission, then gets forced into helping the team. Finally after a stupid, SHORT and crony conversation at a bar the guys he met only a few hours ago and wasn't helping when their lives were in danger become his FAMILY. He then transforms into an entity we have no information about to fight an entity we have no information about and dies. The movie also suffers with terrible fight choreography and cinematography. Who the hell thought that it was a good idea to make the belly dancer who can kill every squad members in an instant fight the squad members in blue fog. And please note that these people supposed to be BAD GUYZ and we don't see anything that proves that. In fact after they run away from the mission after their neck bombs are disarmed they return to help Rick Flag save his belly dancer girlfriend.The big bad is the spirit of a centuries old belly dancing witch who is powerful enough to destroy the world and has possessed an extremely unprofessional archaeologist. Her only weakness is her heart. And both her heart and her were left without being monitored by the head of USA's covert organization named Argus."
" Great Movie
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I don't know what all the crybabies are whining about. This is a very well put together movie. Will Smith holds his own and leads the talented ensemble through this maze of organized chaos. I don't know why you all are hating on it so much! The movie is supposed to be FUN.. not bring World Piece! I thoroughly enjoyed escaping reality for a couple hours. I followed the plot easily enough and the screen writing did a pretty good job with throwing in puns and keeping the action at a pretty good clip. All in all, I think they did a pretty damn good job on this flick! Now don't be throwing a bunch of hate my way! Heaven knows that there are some pretty touchy folks out there now-a-days that are insulted if someone doesn't agree with their point of view. This is just one guys opinion on one movie. Agree to disagree if you like, but don't be mean!"
" This is an unfocused mess
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,2,"This movie was a mess it's hard for me to say anything positive about it,it had OK cinematography and pacing the effects were OK but it still wasn't good.It tried to embrace the fact that it was a comic book movie but just made a weird jumbled tone of serious and comical.They ruined Harley Quinn's backstory which could've been a movie on its own,speaking of which it suffers from the same thing as batman v superman it tried the shove to much crap in which made it incredibly on focused. The characters were boring and clichéd and some of them completely useless,like killer croc doing nothing but swimming in the climax and ""the man that can climb anything"" dying.This movie was overall unpleasant to sit through."
" Who signed off on this...
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,1,"Just like with Batman vs Superman, it was hard to grasp that anything so detrimentally bad would ever be produced, let alone hit the cinema.It obviously my own fault for watching both of these monstrosities (in fast-forward).If you haven't watched it yet - don't. Let's hope someone at DC figures this out and stops making these turds. I mean where this all go from Nolan's Batman...I would rather watch 5 Seasons of the Iron Fist, which wasn't very good, but still in a entirely different League compared to this over CGI'd, soulless, shoddingly casted, miss-written stinker of a movie.No, just no."
" not a good plot
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,4,"This is one of the poorer films based on comics. The biggest problem is the villain, the Enchantress, was stupid. She doesn't do much till the end. And as for the squad, Deadshot was the best character and actually had a talent that would be helpful in combat. Exactly what did Harley Quinn do that was so special that she would be useful in taking out a witch. How about nothing. She is just there for one-liners. The make-up/costume for the Croc was cool, but Croc hardly did anything. And Boomerang guy didn't have a special talent. Diablo had the best gift and him and Deadshot were the only ones worthy to be selected for the special task force. And then thrown in all this was the Joker, whom just shows up time to time. All he is there for is to show how he turned the doctor into crazy Harley Quinn.FINAL VERDICT: The plot was too convoluted. But I'm sure 12 year olds will still like it."
" The hate is confusing
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,8,"Just to clarify, I do love DC (& Marvel) but I am not one of those brainwashed DC fanboys that just loves anything with the DC brand on it. I found Batman Vs Superman upsettingly bad & after watching that I found my myself questioning many other aspects of Man Of Steel.Anyway, whenever there's a film that's from a long line of stories & characters, franchises etc. & I feel the film isn't a great reflection of the background it was based on, I always ask myself is it a good standalone film? Although Suicide Squad may not have done justice to the comics & stories it was based on, as a film by itself I found it to be enjoyable.There were some really dumb parts to it I admit. Such as Killer Croc & Diablo doing almost nothing throughout the film. Also there were so many opportunities for jokes in the right places. Well executed jokes in films like this help keep them grounded & not cheesy.But the acting was overall good by nearly all the cast. The action was up to standards & the plot......wasn't terrible.The soundtrack was lacking, there's no denying anything there & I feel indifferent to Leto's Joker. Although I feel that tattoos aren't something the Joker would get, somewhat interfering with the whole absolutely nameless & origin-less ideology of the Joker, it's still an interesting take on the character. I also feel his concern for Harley was very misplaced. The Joker usually only ever sees Harley as an object. But we don't know how long they've been together or what exactly they've been through together at this stage so again, there could be some reasoning behind it.I don't think his film deserves anywhere near all the hate it gets but I do understand why people would not like it. There are countless absolutely awful films out there that I see people trying to justify & they just come off as mad most of the time.I enjoyed it as just a bit of fun. I think people may have just been expecting too much from it."
" Incredibly terrible.
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,1,"Just so, so, so awful. Too many characters, none of which I cared about. I started to write more but then deleted it, as I don't see why I should have to muster more cleverness in composing this review than the producers did when churning out this movie in the first place, so I'll just repeat... Just so, so, so awful. DC struggles to keep up with its betters."
" Average
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,5,"I saw this movie about 6 months after it appeared in theaters. Seeing as I couldn't go on the premiere, I was pretty excited. Big mistake! The action goes from slow, to fast, to slow again, just like a roller coaster. The characters don't have enough depth and some of them do a horrible job as actors - the fire dude really hasn't impressed me. The plot of the movie is tangled and it took me some time and research of the original DC characters to understand it. I gave it a 5/10 rating, because I've seen worse, but I've also seen better. Will not watch again."
" This movie is truly awful
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,2,"This movie has no coherent story, there are no stakes, the reason this movie exists is to be DC's version of the avengers but with bad guys. This movie would score higher if it didn't take such a cool premise and just waste it with the story that makes no sense, the glaring plot holes, the useless characters, pointless dialogue and exposition and more. The only thing going for it (and the reason it gets a 2 and not a 1) is Will Smith doing Will Smith stuff and some humor from Harley Quinn. which is all drowned out by stuff like: 'this is Kitana. she's got my back. i would advise not getting killed by her. her sword traps the souls of its victims.'it took a cool premise and cool characters that all could have had their own movies but jammed all of them in one. this could easily have been stretched into 6+ movies before this was made with all the cool characters they had in this. it tries too hard to rush an ensemble movie without us knowing or caring about anyone in it. and don't get me started on how useless and edgy the joker is in this."
" Entertaining film. Decent quick backstory on the characters. Not the best story or acting.
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,5,"Entertaining film. Decent quick backstory on the characters. Not the best story or acting.Quick moving entertaining Hollywood film. For the budget, one may think this film sucks. The acting and story are below par. The Joker character and actor sucked. A Few of the characters and actors were decent but nothing substantial. The fx were decent, but again for the budget, they were weak.This is a B movie, rating is a B, however for the budget, 5 stars given for balance."
" total garbage
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,1,not sure how a movie could be so bad. first off all of the characters are dumb. harley quinn is the most worthless character. are we seriously meant to believe she could actually do something in a fight? she has zero powers except being symbol of lack of imagination. i would give this no stars if i could.
" Watching this movie made me want to commit suicide!
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,1,The real villains of the this story are the creators of this movie and the director David Ayers. A disgrace to DC comics. I did not care if any of the characters died. Another movie where the CGI took precedence over the plot. I would get more satisfaction watching some hill billys blow some stuff up on you tube. At least the back story is better than this movie and the explosions are real instead of CGI.
" It is not well executed
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,5,"The dialogues are poor, cinematography poorer. DC requires outsourcing the best of their ideas including Batman and Superman and all of Suicide Squad to Marvel. They can make a much better movie out of it. Deadshot is okay; Harley Quinn is the best, but it could have been much better; others don't have much screen time. Yes, it is dark and requires to be dark, but different. Why even include the Joker in the movie, when he is not playing any good role, just intro to the story could have been done in a different fashion. Otherwise, the Joker could have delivered the final blow. Again DC - this one too like all others - it's a missed opportunity. Please give your characters to Marvel. Suicide Squad in all - is an average movie, not well executed."
" There's bad .. and then there's this ... DC Can't seem to get it right.
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,2,"So Batman makes a few cameos ... (even though its a film about the villains )The Flash made a cameo ... There's a main ""villain"" called the enchantress ... The joker got a bad version portrayal .... dramatic and not in a good way lol There's an intro to the 4/5 main characters each with their special powers (as narrated by VD) LOL Oh and Viola Davis is in the movie lol and finally, there's a soundtrack to go with every character lol ... My god this sounds so over convoluted lol ...thats because it is ! Its messy and weird and sloppy ..with a lot of music. Its unfocused and not at all visually attractive. Rooting for the villain is not a good concept, it blurs the lines when its time to root for the good guys.It is fun in a silly (it does not take itself too seriously kid of way) but it certainly does not deserve a sequel. Its comedic tone and terrible dialogue were insulting ....oh and Kitana is in it ... Final Grade F+ Epic Fail of ultimate proportions lol"
" A Bull's-Eye of Horrible Execution
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,4,"Admit it, you want to like this movie. Even if you never heard of Suicide Squad prior to the trailer's unveiling at Comic-Con, it just looked like a winner. Then came the reviews last week Headlines have denigrated Suicide Squad for all manner of politicized reasons. It has been labeled as misogynist, racist, and morally vapid. I simply do not agree. You do not need to stand on a soapbox of social superiority to call attention to how this film failed in political correctness; it is much easier to blatantly call it out for being an incoherent mess of atrociously executed plot lines and editing. I have to call attention to the editing, because I like to think there may very well be a better movie left on the cutting room floor. This is little consolation for the monumental disappointment fans are flocking to see in record numbers.The introduction is hopeful. Director and writer David Ayer wastes no time in getting us into the miserable and eccentric prison lives of the beloved Gotham villains. Will Smith as the world's greatest assassin, Deadshot; Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as the mutant crocodile-human hybrid, Killer Croc; Jay Hernandez as the repressed pyro-kinetic, Diablo; Jai Courtney as the slovenly Australian thief, Boomerang; and of course Margot Robbie as Joker's right hand wild card, Harley Quinn. More than looking the part, this cast admirably puts their backs and hearts into these characters. This is almost tragic considering so many other elements of the movie failed to do them justice. Viola Davis plays the government spook who masterminds the ""Suicide Squad Initiative"", a worst-case-scenario operation that involves taking the nation's most dangerous prisoners and thinly offering them clemency in exchange for defending the home team. So, what atrocity leads to the gang being organized? Enchantress, an ancient witch inhabiting a doctor's body, breaks free from the government's leverage and wreaks unholy havoc on a global level. The issue with this, Enchantress is initially a member of the Suicide Squad. The rest of the team is organized for the first time to battle one of their own members who went rogue. And I kid you not, this paradox is never addressed. The loose debates about letting these mass murderers walk the streets pivots on an assurance of control. Once the control is lost with one member, the rest are allowed out of their cages to get it back. Our love for the characters is stretched so far that we are expected to turn a blind eye to gaping plot holes and lazy justifications. The story ostensibly fast forwards through necessary expositions and tangents to get to the next battle or witty exchange between squad members.For all its faults, there are short stretches of entertainment when you feel the joy Jared Leto and Margot Robbie bring to their roles. Flashbacks to Leto's Joker with Robbie will make you lament that they didn't just ride that tangent instead of letting this story go so astray. Will Smith has moments of embodying Deadshot in very satisfying ways. He can strike a pose in the heat of battle that summons more fond memories of the comic character. The actors have a reverence for the material that is unfortunately not shared by everyone on the project. Because Suicide Squad can officially be called a blockbuster despite critical backlash, it's a lock for a sequel. When that project comes to fruition, you may still want to like it, but you at least may not expect to."
" Just another average movie
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,5,"Up 'till now, I guess we all got used to the fact that today's superhero movies are not so super as they are supposed to be. Moreover, they are rather average, just like this one.The acting crew of Suicide Squad is pretty good and they depict their characters pretty good (although Killer Croc should be twice bigger). But that was of little help to this movie, since it practically drowned in the mess of its own story.The movie begins quite slowly. Then, out of a sudden, the plot begins quite accidentally and develops so fast (and without adequate explanation) that it disrupts the pace, making you wonder what happened. Then the story develops into constant not-so-special action with average CGI, overall inconsistency, lame jokes and cliché wisecracks. To me, the very idea of the plot was odd and uninventive.Character development is unevenly performed. There are two main characters who simply overshadowed other seemingly important characters. To somehow fix that, the producers frequently inserted unnecessary and pointless dialogues between the action scenes. To no avail. The supporting characters remained shallow and, for the most part of the movie, utterly useless.Still, this movie is watchable, but don't expect anything special. If you like the Suicide Squad from the comics, the animated movie Batman: Assault on Arkham is far better exemplar."
" Overall, a disappointment, but I remain optimistic about the future of the DCEU
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,4,"If anything, the marketing team for ""Suicide Squad"" did their job well. Following the critical backlash against ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" the second trailer for David Ayer's supervillain team-up showcased a more light-hearted tone than that of last spring's Comic Con teaser, and all of the following trailers and TV spots were edited to near perfection. The hype was real. The stakes were high. But how did it measure up?The characters and the talent behind them are the driving force behind ""Suicide Squad."" DC could not have made a better casting decision than Will Smith as Deadshot, and Margot Robbie was nowhere to be found in this movie: there was only Harley Quinn. And where there is Harley Quinn, there will always be the Joker.All of the film's promotional material pointed to Jared Leto's clown prince of crime being the primary antagonist, but sadly this was not the case. The band of supervillains are instead tasked with taking on an evil more supernatural in nature, an odd choice considering that only two members of the squad actually have powers.The film's pacing is abysmal, its story is bland and the reason that the squad gets together makes very little sense. However, these negative aspects did not compromise my enjoyment of ""Suicide Squad"" as a whole because of the humor and fun brought forth by the characters and their interactions with one another. I look forward to seeing more of these villains, and I remain optimistic about the future of the DC cinematic universe."
" Better Film Than Most Want To Believe
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"Will Smith, Jared Leto and Margot Robbie lead the charge in this villain powered story of saving the world. First off, Jared Leto is not as good of a Joker as Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson or even Cesar Romero. He is the easiest to hate Joker to ever appear on screen. In that sense, it's a good thing as he is a villain. Margot Robbie was the perfect choice and my pick for Harley Quinn before she was even officially cast. She delivers the best female Batman villain performance in movie history. She also steals the show in every scene she's in. Will Smith's performance as Deadshot was 100x better than I thought it was going to be. The character conflict and growth between Deadshot and Rick Flag is an amazing process to watch play out. Killer Croc is brought to screen very well also."
" Worst from dc
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,3,"SPOILERS. Suicide squad was not entirely bad it did had some moments . But that's all it had. Poor script that could have done without a few characters. Slipknot was wasted,captain boomerang was wasted,katana was wasted,killer croc was wasted and worst of all they made batman look pathetic. This comes out from a man whose favourite movie is TDK the last outing of joker with batman. But that's not the only complain the editing was pathetic jump cuts that made no sense. The only characters who actually get screen time are deadshot and harley and even they don't fit in the script properly. The third act was boring The whole movie is about Dr june dying if the witch and guess what she lives The amount someone will spend reading this review (if someone actually does) will be more them slipknot's screen time was Ohhh man this movie was pathetic I was giving it a 5 rating but now i have changed my mind"
" Emptiness rarely looks this good!
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,6,"You watch films looking for an intriguing, witty plot? You think the characters introduced should serve an actual purpose in developing said plot? You want a sort of consistency and continuity that makes it feel ""real"" or ""authentic"" in some way? Stay away then.No. A good story build upon characters that actually take a meaningful role within that: That's not what this is, nor what it tries to be. It's painfully obvious that the whole film is a promotion project for itself, a nonsense-trip with an attitude. If you care... about anything really: Talk to the hand. It is all about that devil-may-care attitude, about the creation of images that may well carry over into an actually good film to come.There are some well done ""short stories"" along the way to nothingness. Some of these are pretty good in their own right. Kind of music clip like. And indeed: The score makes its point accurately. Half the characters are fillers, as if to make it feel more random, chaotic and brightly colourful. Things need to be dumbed down a bit if all you want is a mindless joyride I guess.It is not a good film BUT it never attempts to be in the first place. Image, attitude and... Ham! That's pretty honest, if nothing else.Take it or leave it - who cares?"
" Amazing cast can't save this movie from horrid studio interference
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,6,"Villains get the spotlight in SUICIDE SQUAD, a movie which is in as much of a dismal situation as its protagonists with an almost bipolar personality caused by an indecision on a proper tone or themes. What could have been a gripping ensemble piece about camaraderie among unlikely companions forged in the fires of conflict becomes yet another loud, messy, superficial blockbuster affair. A movie about second chances and an exploration of the minds behind the monsters that are these supervillains dials back on all this potential depth in the name of making itself more ""fun"".From the get go, SUICIDE SQUAD had a tall order to tackle. It had to introduce not one, not two, but a whopping 9 characters into this cinematic universe called the DC Extended Universe or DCEU. Not only that, they had to go from bad guy to good guy and settle their individual character arcs within the span of 2 hours. This is a team movie but we had barely known the team members. In a flurry of disjointed flashbacks and flash forwards, we are brought up to speed on the history of our characters leading up to their current situation as patsies recruited by the ruthless Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) to be a black ops task force in the service of the government. Marksman Deadshot (Will Smith), mutated strongman Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), self-blaming pyrokinetic gangster El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), master of ropes Slipknot (Adam Beach), crazy Aussie with a pony obsession (it makes sense in context) Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), crazier little psychopath Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), all led by the stern no-nonsense Captain Rick Flagg and his sword wielding assistant Katana.Immediately apparent is the tremendous chemistry among the cast. Each role is masterfully played and feel exactly like the comic book brought to life. Of particular note are Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and veteran Will Smith's Deadshot. The respective actors nail the various facets of these complex characters perfectly, portraying them as layered individuals hiding their inner brokenness behind a façade of bravado and false smiles. That being said, only Deadshot and Harley get any decent development. The others are relegated to being a supporting cast with barely an arc much less any character depth. A pity though, seeing as how colourful a cast it was, and how intriguing their backstories from the comics were.For their first mission, the squad is sent into Midway City to investigate an apparent terrorist attack. Instead what they find is a supernatural invasion like something out of Ghostbusters. Faceless humanoid zombie things roam the streets while special effects mumbo jumbo continually pours out of a peculiar train station. Slowly it is revealed that there is more to this attack than meets the eye which seems to have a personal connection to one of the squad. But first, they would have to fight their way across the city in some of the messiest, uninspired fight sequences filmed in recent years all set to a bland generic score and shot in a haphazard manner with each frame saturated in garish purple, oily blacks and acid green.Oh and the Joker (Jared Leto) is in this movie somewhere, appearing occasionally throughout the movie like a wheezing Wiley Coyote intent on saving his lost love Harley. We really do not get much about him other than he is a mob boss, kills people, and has a disturbing as heck chuckle. SUICIDE SQUAD is muddled by erratic pacing for the most part, brought about by the sloppy editing that looks more like a music video and less like a movie. Perhaps that was the point when they packed the film full of pop songs from likes of Eminem, Rick James and Skrillex; it is a feature length compilation of music videos in which the characters actually stop for an intermission to get a drink right in the middle of a war.Here is a movie that is unable to decide on its identity, no doubt brought about by the executive meddling that plagued its production. It feels like it was originally a much darker, sombre, character centred movie. Such a film would have been more in line with Director David Ayers' style, having done the brutal war movie Fury. Instead, it is pumped full of dark humour which, though well executed, takes away any complexity or meaningful themes that the movie could have incorporated. It is so superficial that even the camaraderie comes out of nowhere. One moment they are complete strangers, and all of a sudden they are best friends. A character claims that the squad is his new family but nowhere do we see them truly bond.SUICIDE SQUAD is saved mainly by the amazing actors and actresses, bringing our favourite comic book villains to life in a way that makes us want to know more about them, their histories, and their stories. They bring a tremendous energy to the screen and snippets of the characters' development and how the varying personalities play off each other are sprinkled throughout the film. Perhaps if it was not mercilessly butchered by editors, SUICIDE SQUAD had potential to be a great ensemble piece digging deep into an exploration of the criminal psyche and a tragic tale of loss and redemption. Instead it was re-cut into a shallow comedy filled mess with bland directing, murky production design, and ended up with the trailers being better than the movie itself."
" One of the worst blockbuster movies i have ever experienced.
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,1,"Suicide squad is the third entry in the DCEU franchise. After the extremely divisive film that was batman v superman, fans had high hopes in this film that it will save DC, having much potential. Unfortunately, it was terrible. The film focuses on a group of villains: Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, El Diablo and Katana in which they must save the world. The film had several re-shoots obviously, as the film at first was supposed to be a dark, gritty film. But the changes ended up more like guardians of the galaxy, with its more colorful changes and witty dialogue. The film is absolutely terrible, giving so little for the characters to work with. Harley Quinn for example, isn't given much aside from her witty, cringe worthy quips and lunatic behavior. Most of the other members are also given very little that is not expanded enough to have any sort of interest. It feels manipulative when it tries to develop these characters. It gives you a small fraction of its backstory and thinks it will be enough to get some emotional investment. It is done so poorly and lazily that its laughable. The opening scene where the film introduces the characters is done terribly, where Amanda Waller is there to throw exposition for the characters, with the flashy texts next to the characters. It ends up feeling rushed and not giving the time it needs. With that said, Harley Quinn and Captain boomerang are fun to watch. While they don't have much to work with, Jai Courtney and Harley Quinn's performances make these characters enjoyable to watch. However the way they treat the joker here is just insulting, giving him less than 15 minutes of appearance and having very little impact on the story was completely unnecessary. He wasn't supposed to be in the movie like this. The film's story doesn't add up. So in the film, Amanda Waller hires these criminals to combat meta-humans, but it doesn't explain why these criminals, who aren't trustworthy. Why not call upon the heroes like wonder woman or batman? It just doesn't add up. The funny thing is that the backstory of these characters, especially Harley Quinn with the joker, would have made a much more interesting film and much more engaging. One other aspect is the directing of the film, which is extremely broken. It can't even do the most basic of film making, having clumsy editing with its flashy lighting when it introduces the characters, the colorful texts that are there to give exposition, the pop songs that feel completely out of place. It doesn't build a moment or give any sort of emotion. Just a pop song thrown there and there. The action scenes are also terribly directed, with its dark lighting that doesn't give a clear sight what's going on, and the cut that makes it hard to follow. It's so broken that it leaves plot holes and continuity errors, to the point where it doesn't even feel like an actual movie. The scenes of the film are disjointed, and making the experience much more painful. This choppy editing, lighting and pop music leads to an inconsistent tone. It doesn't know if it wants to be a dark, gritty emotional film, or a fun witty film with funny mischievous protagonists. it's unfocused and it ends up being confusing. The film is also needlessly dark in its lighting. It makes the film visually assaulting on the eyes The film is a complete failure that it missed a potential opportunity to save the DCEU franchise. I can understand the appeal of the fans for this movie, but it was just a pain."
" Truly One Of The Worst Films of 2016.
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,1,"I am sorry to say that I gave Suicide Squad the thumbs down. Like Batman VS. Superman: Dawn of Justice, Deadpool and Ghostbusters, Suicide Squad is truly one of the worst films of 2016. It was no better, no worse than Batman VS. Superman: Dawn of Justice. It was not a very good film. Will Smith and Margot Robbie gave good performances and Margot Robbie really got into character as Harley Quinn and she very much the role her own. Jared Leto was an Okay Joker, but he tried too hard to top Heath Ledger's performance. Jai Courtney is truly one of the world's worst actors and again gives another average performance. The cast didn't have a good on-screen chemistry. The film was a mess. It very much ripped off Guardians of the Galaxy and The Avengers. Ben Affleck and Ezra Miller's cameos as Batman and The Flash were wasted and wasn't enough to save the film. What a shame! Suicide Squad could had been better. It is one of the worst films of 2016 and one of the worst films we've had in the last 7 years."
" Worth the watch
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,7,"Not a massive DC comic guy but this was decent for something that I'm not normally really into, despite it's mixed bag reviews I found it good and very watchable, Will Smith was quality throughout and played his role as Deadshot to perfection loved his performance, I can understand why people left concerns about the Role Joker played which is very self-explanatory but the side story in the movie about him and Harley Quinn and how they met didn't mix in well with the film. but other than that I thought the bad reviews left were harsh as it was enjoyable."
" If you've read the comics stay away.
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,4,"While I understand the general trend with Comic Book Movies that they are just action and one-liners that is totally true here. I have high hopes while being a massive fan of a lot of characters in the film.I have to say that not everything I say about the film will be negative as there are always positives such as Jared Leto played a great character that just never really felt like the Joker. Also Robbie as Quinn was superb.Killer Croc came across as very ghetto (I know he was coloured but he never came across as ghetto in the comics, ever) Also why was Killer Croc even selected? He's in King Shark places (but honestly that never really bothered me, I love Killer Croc)While Will Smith is still one of my favourite actors his portrayal of Deadshot leaves a lot to be desired. Can't really go into the plot as you know it all already, World is in danger someone needs to save it. Character development does happen but there's not a lot to work with.While I found this a slap in the face I am sure those that haven't read the Comics or have little to no knowledge of the characters should find this passable or maybe even better."
" Not as expected.
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,5,"Surrounding with huge hypes, I was expecting a fantastic movie. My excitement was more to see Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and it did pay off. The only good part about this movie was Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Ultimately, the movie was a mess. Story as similar to dirt and except Margot and Will, everyone were crap. Jared was good as Joker but he was not given enough screen time to prove that he can come close to the level Heath set as Joker in The Dark Knight. Direction was good and so was the background score but the bad story ruined it all. Margot and Will were the only one who tried to lift the movie with their acting chops but the bad story again ruined it here. I would recommend to watch it for once only if you have patience to watch whatever crap the producers are trying to make you see in the name of Superhero genre movie. DC has way to go to match the Marvel's charisma."
" Best Harley Quinn ever!
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,7,"With your kind permission, will break the review down as follows: 1. The Story.Ugh! Near as I can tell, this has something to do with a government hack anticipating the need for a Dirty Dozen squad to replace Superman in an emergency and then the emergency turns out to be one of her very own making? Joss Whedon is not losing sleep over this writing team.2. The Motivation.Money, of course. The trend in Superhero films is backwards and bizarro, so this is an excuse to dust out the characters in the DC library who never get screen time and get the coins rolling. Same thing Marvel does.3. The Payoff.The film (saw the extended cut) is not bad. The lead reviewer who said it was worse than Superman Vs. Batman may possibly have misplaced his sense of humor. But the real payoff is the best live Quinn (played by Margot Robb) ever! Quinn has always been the perfect male fantasy that everyone else missed -- drop dead gorgeous, nutty as a fruitcake, and with a core of sweetness. Worth watching just for that."
" Don't get the bad reviews I loved it
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,9,I went to see the movie with an open mind and heart and I loved it I Can't believe the reviews I am reading for it took my siblings who loved it too we were able to enjoy the action and adventure even humor together and everyone love it I loved the sassy and sweet Harley Quinn she is a doll baby and I liked will Smith in the movie but my only concern to parents would be language and violence you might want to talk to the kids about how it's OK to like the characters but not to behave like the characters if you do this you should be fine with the family watching
" Pointless story
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,4,"The firs hour of the movie simply happens with no transitioning, it makes no sense. I'm no fan of Tarantino, but an intro of his style would've been better than the 30 minute boring intro they give to the squad. Tha guy they simply introduce by name with no background story is the first to die, and it was completely obvious. enchantress was never part of the squad, the black woman never had her under control, her should've saved her, not vice-versa. Deadshot being good? ill grant he's never an evil guy joker style, he's simply a mercenary, but he's definitely not good. i give the 2nd hour a 6/10."
" Messy, blurred, not enough individual screen time and poor acting but some fairly enjoyable and funny moments
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,6,"Suicide Squad is the direct follow up to BATMAN V SUPERMAN, a film that was discredited by regular watchers and critics, so really it would've been nice/good if suicide squad was almost like a backup to get fans back into DC movies. Unfortunately Suicide Squad failed in lots of ways to some extent. It had blurred action scenes toward the end, poor cast choice, not enough individual screen time and a fairly messy script, the characters weren't emphasised enough and it was unclear what Jared Leto's Joker was actually to doing for half the film, as Cara Delevingne poorly performed Enchantress to up most of the screen time he INDIVIDUALLY deserved as if you going to add one of the most popular villains in comic books into a movie you have to give him enough screen time. However overall it was enjoyable as some of the casting was decent, including Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davies and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje were well picked for the character (even if some of them didn't get enough screen time). It would've been nice to see more emphasis on Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's Killer Croc, his strengths and weaknesses and his relationship with Batman. I though he was well picked for the character though as he has got the wright body type and muscle. To further matter it would have been nice to see a little more emphasis on Karen Fukuhara's Katanna as I thought she did an exceptionally good Katanna but I can see why that character shouldn't or won't being expanded upon. Jay Hernandez's El'Diablo had a little bit to much screen time like Margot Robbie and Will Smith. Margot Robbie's and Jared Leto's relationship wasn't creepy as David Ayer thought it was and I think their relationship should have been expanded on at a later date (Joker movie or Harley Quinn movie or Batman movie). Furthermore there wasn't enough screen time for other characters due to the over emphasised Harley, Joker relationship. Consequently due to the messy script Joker just appeared dealing with mob bosses and nothing else that he did had any affect or meaning. Overall this movie is worth watching so that you are up to date on all the crazy stuff going on/down in the DCEU. Otherwise this movie is nothing to get exited about, other than the half decent cast and humour. I hope this review helps you decide your own opinion or helps you decide whether or not to watch the movie."
" I dozed off
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,4,"If you're familiar with the DC universe you probably have an idea (even a vague one) about it without somebody elaborating.I don't usually read reviews before watching certain kinds of movies. Even though I try to avoid trailers, the hype, marketing and information in general tends to get to me anyway.Suicide Squad is exactly that kind of movie...I really wanted to see it even before bits and pieces of information got to me. After I ended up watching a trailer (which didn't have anything new for me by then) and a few ads - I was definitely sold. However, I didn't go to the cinema and managed to watch it after it was released on DVD.To get to the point, it wasn't just bad – it was terrible!If you're into super hero stuff, checking out whatever DC (or Marvel) throws at you, you're gonna watch this anyway. I was lucky to see it after being released on DVD, so I was able to skip back and see the action I missed whenever I fell asleep.That's right, the action happens to be the most dreadful part!So, here it is, without spoilers:A secret government agency bands together the most dangerous super villains to form a defensive task force which is supposed to save the world from the Apocalypse.Personally, I might go out on a limb by saying that none of the villains are super. I could be wrong because I might have missed it (during the action).Since we're talking about the DC universe, I can't really say that character development is unrealistic. While each and every one of them is lacking depth, they're also inconsistent with previous successful representations in highly rated movies (but that's been done before so it's nothing to scoff at).THE GOOD: I liked the trailers, the actors and (almost) everything about it before seeing it. In fact, some of the best parts are in the trailers and the marketing.I have to admit I've had a few laughs hearing some of the lines""I put him in a hole, and threw away the hole.""But that's about it.You might wanna check out this poster too - it looks like a villainous mushroom cloud.THE AWFUL: I don't think the actors can be blamed for any part of this mess. Actually, they did quite a good job considering the circumstances and the characters they had to play.The Joker? Huuuge joke. Somebody obviously forgot about ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) which was a masterpiece, with Heath Ledger's excellent interpretation of the Joker.I'm not saying Jared Leto was bad – in fact he was really good. I'm gonna go as far as saying he did a perfect job playing the role he was given in this fiasco.Batman? Why would they give the role to someone else while Christian Bale nailed it? Repeatedly While Ben Affleck didn't play a poor Batman, in my opinion he was a perfect Daredevil (2003).Supporting cast aside, even with Will Smith in his shoes, Deadshot didn't exactly fit the profile of a villain.Neither did Harley Quinn or anyone else for that matter (at least not in the sense they were advertised).The beginning seemed promising, especially with the introduction of these two, but it just didn't deliverTo wrap it up, you should wait till you see it on TV. That's the only way to make sure you won't be sorry.But can you wait for that long?"
" A good movie
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,10,Idk what everybody else is watching but suicide squad is my favorite movie of all times it's funny crazy I watched it so many times I love Harley and the joker I don't like action movies but I can say I love this movie I guess nobody like it because it's not all about the heroes and stuff but it's different and I love it
" It just crap like, really crap
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,4,"David Ayer you disappoint me, well at least you can learn something from this, don' go spending money in bad stuff like this movie in 3D Good thing i payed almost everything when i went to the cinema, godamn Cinepolis and their high prices but tasty popcorn i must say, if you're wondering i started talking about pop corn is because i need 5 lines to publish this rubbish and i don't want to write how crap the movie is so i gave it a 1 out of 10Godammit"
" It could've been awesome
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,5,"I'm right in the middle with this one. It's not a terrible awful movie but is definitely not excellent. There are thousands or reviews about it, so I'm gonna keep this one short.WATCH THE EXTENDED CUT. Yep, if you haven't seen it yet and you're curious about it, watch the extended cut. Still has issues BUT has better character development, more interesting interactions and the added scenes help to create a better pace (one of the main problems, in my opinion, with the original theatrical version).In the end, I think the biggest problem with this film is how cool it looked in the trailers, and how dumb is the actual plot. But thanks to the performances I actually enjoyed it. Give it a try. I think in the end we all agree on one thing, It could've been awesome. (we cannot trust DC)"
" perfect
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,10,"In resume... For me i separate my review in 3 important parts. The movie: 9 of 10, Stars: 10 of 10 and Movie soundtracks: 11 of 10. Suicide Squad is a little bit of 02 hours Action movie and when you watch these 02 hours passed very quick. Not more one 'superheros vs villains' boring movie, it is fun, its is different."
" Originally saw it in theater...
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,4,"...and wasn't especially impressed. But hey, I went back and watched it again(for free this time) just to try with a hopefully unbiased eye. The relatively unbiased opinion is that if one looks at this simply as an summer blockbuster action flick it is at least okay. Biased first:Personally, thought Smith did a decent job with his character...not sure who that character was as it was not Deadshot...I enjoyed Robbie as Harley Quinn.Leto was interesting as Joker...not sure why Joker was in this movie.Pretty much the rest of the characters were forgettable throw-away.Unbiased:Weak plot.Mediocre to poor script.While there were a few humorous moments, mostly it fell flat.Decent special effects.OK sound track.Some big names.If they hadn't called it Suicide Squad I'd have given it a 5. Going into it familiar with the Suicide Squad I'd give it a 3."
" Suicide Squad delivers a solid two hours of aesthetically pleasing, superpowered action that's just plain fun to watch.
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,6,"There are currently two serious, mind-boggling questions that need to be answered. First, why did John Flickster watch Fifty Shades Of Black (2016)? Second, why isn't Justin Bieber on display in some zoo? By the way, I like watching some of John Flickster's movie reviews. He has a good channel. Anyway, I watched Suicide Squad (2016) some time ago, and I was somewhat surprised by it. Warner Bros. Pictures is in the process of creating its own so-called cinematic universe with DC Comics superheroes. This decision was influenced by the money-making success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. So, like any other large entertainment company without an original idea, Warner Bros. Pictures wants to get in on the action. Some people might say that the company is not off to a good start. They're right. But I still like some things in the movies that Warner Bros. Pictures has released so far. These movies are Man Of Steel (2013), Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice (2016) and Suicide Squad (2016). On the one hand, these movies are dumb, unoriginal, violent and depressing pieces of Hollywood garbage. On the other hand, there are some good ideas in these movies. Also, the acting is good in places, the special effects are good, and, for example, the people that worked on hair and make-up for Suicide Squad deserved winning an Oscar. But this is what one would expect from Warner Bros, which is a major Hollywood studio. I mean, you can't expect a movie with a budget of almost $200 million to be garbage on all levels. Still, because of the problems that I've mentioned, I'm not going to go around and say that I like Suicide Squad or Man Of Steel. Seriously, how can you like a movie in which ships look like johnsons? That's really too bad because I like some other things in Man Of Steel, like the special effects and the designs. Unfortunately, I will never say that I like Man Of Steel because it's depressing, because the characters are not interesting, and because Zack Snyder seems to have an obsession with phallus symbolism in all of his movies. Does anyone remember 300, which was released in 2006? Thanks to that movie, we've learned that soldiers in Ancient Greece spent a lot of time working out in American gyms. Maybe the Persians should have bought passes to American gyms too. Suicide Squad is an entertaining movie. I probably enjoyed watching it more than I enjoyed watching Man Of Steel. Still, like Man Of Steel, Suicide Squad is weighed down by some of the same problems, and it is, first of all, a Hollywood product. I feel the same way about Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith. I remember watching this movie in a theatre. It's when I was still going to high school. I watched it in the same theatre in which I watched Ghost In The Shell 2: Innocence. It was summer. The auditorium was full of people. There were many children. I remember being entertained by Revenge Of The Sith. It was quite a spectacle on the big screen. It's one of my most memorable theatre going experiences. But now, of course, I know that it's not such a good movie. It has some problems, to say the least. Watching it in a theatre, however, was quite something. There have been so many movies about superheroes in the last decade that there have been talks about superhero movie fatigue, as if people are tired of watching movies about superheroes. Well, I certainly don't have this fatigue. Other people don't have this fatigue too because these movies are still very profitable. If they're done well, they will certainly make a lot of money. Though I have the feeling that Hollywood keeps making these movies not just for profits. It seems to me that these movies have a certain social message, especially movies about teams of superheroes. I think that the concept of superheroes and supervillains in Western society goes back to feudalism and to knights. So much Western literature is about super heroes and super villains. So, Sherlock Holmes just had to be a super detective and Professor Moriarty just had to be a super criminal. This concept of individualism is present in the art and literature of few other cultures."
" A Suicidal move for DC !!!
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,2,"Suicide Squad is a failed attempt from DC trying to fill their universe with villains and cool characters while at the same time the movie lacks the character development or even a mediocre story/script that could make it watchable.
Pros:
-Expanding the DCEU's possibilities
-Interesting character portrails (Harley/Deadshot)
Cons:
-Bad story
-Uninteresting action
-Too many characters
-Incredibly bad villains
-Lacking character development

This movie fails on so many levels but succeeds in two major aspect: marketing and earnings.There are too many character, poor editing and there is no red thread to follow. Plot points are dropped and others picked up. Characters remain mysteries by sheer neglect, making it difficult to connect to them. This is Hollywood blockbuster at a low point. They rushed through the making, and spent all their focus on marketing. Because if you want to make money, marketing is were to focus. If you want to make art, entertainment or whatever you want to call a well-made piece of film, you respect the process."
" Yeah, i like it but...
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,4,"But it was like Batman vs Superman, not so good. I don't know what happens with the DC Cinematic Universe. Their movies are not so liked by critics and the peoples have mixed feelings. From this film I liked Harley Quinn and Joker, of course. The rest of the cast it was like a part of poor action movie. Will Smith was better in Hancock than in this. I wait the Harley Quinn movie. Maybe Joker will get his solo movie too."
" Better than I thought
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"While it had the very typical super hero plot line, Suicide Squad looked at the villain side and made it quite appealing. By looking into the humanity of these villains, viewers get to see a different side of this ""super hero"" story. Will smith is the strongest character and plays the dark dead shot with perfection. By him playing off the other strong characters, such as Harley Quinn and Diablo, there is a strong sense of commodity between these so called villains."
" Suicide Mission
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,6,"You'd expect people to say that about DC trying to place themselves as a worthy opponent and rival to Marvel. And while in the Comic Book world it is a competition, it's hard to see that in the Movie universe happening anytime soon. Which is a shame when you think that this also could've been so much better.While I've only seen the cinematic version (not the extended one), this unfortunately wasn't as much fun as I'd hoped for. Still it wasn't all bad. What was almost all bad strangely enough, was Harley Quinn. The trailer promised a lot, but apart from kind of like every funny line being in there, they didn't work in the movie itself. They felt all wrong and I don't fault the Margot Robbie for that. Also the inciting incident is so crazy, I wonder if anyone actually can just swallow that pill without going blank and kind of crazy.There are a lot of good actors involved in this and they alone warrant a viewing of this. Also the action, no matter how far fetched and stretched it may seem, kind of works too. Just do not compare it under no circumstances with Guardians ..."
" Horrible edit but some intense and compelling performances
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"I have to still give it an 8 because Robbie, Leto, Hernandez and Smith are absolutely at the top of their mutual games here.Margot Robbie could not be more spot-on as Harley Quinn. She has the physical look to match the character and obviously spent a lot of time getting the mannerisms and personality just right. She's athletic and did most of her own stunts in the movie, including a particularly frightening long underwater scene.Jared Leto is the only Joker I've ever seen that I found compelling - but I'm a woman. I understand why the overgrown fanboys don't particularly care for sexy gangster Joker, but every woman I know thought he was smoking hot in the role. Leto has aaaaahmazing chemistry with Robbie and if D.C. has the good sense to focus a movie on their Joker & Harley Quinn, all I can say is, take my money.Will Smith's portrayal of a cold blooded professional hit-man who cares about one thing - his young daughter - is equally exceptional. It's hard to think of a bad guy no matter what he's done because of the humanity and vulnerability he brings to the role. He did a great job without having a lot to work with script-wise.Viola Davis is an excellent villain in this. She's everything that has ever been wrong with the government and she really makes you relate to the so-called criminals who are at her mercy.Finally, Jay Hernandez is terrific as a villain trying not to use his highly destructive superpowers. He knocked it out of the ballpark. I would love to see more of his backstory in Suicide Squad 2. For that matter, I'd watch a whole movie about the character.The Enchantress plot is weak and, quite frankly, boring. Kinnaman and Delavigne have zero chemistry so you don't care about their relationship, which might have made it a lot more interesting. Some characters are just filler (Captain Boomerang, Katana, Slipknot - who cares?) The biggest problem is that they sliced and diced this movie to the point where a lot of it makes no sense. It looks like it was edited by a chimp. The extended cut is MUCH better but I wish they'd release a full version with everything they actually filmed.The sequel is coming so hopefully WB/DC can do better this time. Give us a lot more of the Joker and Harley relationship - those two are scorching hot together! - and definitely more Smith and Hernandez in their roles. Don't sacrifice backstory and character development for action. Half your audience is women - you can't just blow stuff up and expect us to be into it. You've got some amazing actors here, so use them!"
" Another DC Disappointment
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,4,"Yet another disappointing film in the DC Extended Universe. Once more we have an overpowering super-villain in the Enchantress, much like with ""X-Men: Apocalypse"". I honestly didn't like much beyond Deadshot, for me, Will Smith carried the film. It suffers from a lot of what the stand-alone Marvel films do, since the stakes are so high you find yourself asking ""Where is Batman?"" and ""Where is Superman?"". The wait is still on for a good film that is part of the DC Extended Universe."
" Harley Quinn deserves a better film
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,4,"Sloppily edited and veering wildly in tone, 'Suicide Squad' is a textbook example of what can go wrong when you try to change the mood of a film halfway through making it. The darkened streets, depressed characters, murderous senators and constant rain give it an especially grim atmosphere. With David 'Fury' Ayer directing, it's clear this was originally meant to be a brooding and cynical film, but every now and then someone will drop a one-liner, or the soundtrack will liven up with 'Ballroom Blitz.' It's almost as if they were verge of calling it finished when someone in Corporate Headquarters decided the burgeoning DC Movie Universe needed it's own 'Deadpool' and called for urgent re-shoots to make it more fun. If so, this was a dreadful mistake. The majority of 'Suicide Squad' is miserable, po-faced and moodier than a fair-weather Goth kid who just spent a weekend reading Nietzche and binging on Opeth albums. The titular squad are essentially a comic book version of The Dirty Dozen, a group of expendable assets brought together to do the Government's rotten jobs in a world where super-powered humans can demolish skyscrapers with their fists. And almost all of them are completely depressed. Deadshot (Will Smith) for example, is a lethal assassin who's killed enough people to fill a football stadium but who really just wants to see his kid again. El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) is a heavily tattooed gang member who can summon fire from his fingertips but is tormented by the death of his family, while Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) is the utterly humourless leader. Granted, in the mission against a crazed Sorceress that takes up most of the movie, he does have a lot to lose, but does he really need to spend so much time furrowing his brow and musing on whether they're doing the right thing?The Government Agents who set up the team meanwhile are ruthlessly sadistic and motivated entirely by self-interest. They're corrupt, murderous and just as bad as the supposed villains. It's a horribly cynical view of the world, but it's not convincing. It's so completely devoid of hope and humanity that 'Suicide Squad' winds up feeling like it was written by depressed 4Chan members. The world is hell man, you snowflakes just don't get it. But strangely, this shadowy and oppressive misery-marathon has the most upbeat and jovial soundtrack this side of 'Guardians Of The Galaxy.' Unlike Peter Quill's mix-tape however, the music here just does not work. None of the songs match what is happening on screen, they're just shoe-horned in haphazardly. Everybody likes 'Bohemian Rhapsody' right? Stick it over some of the prison scenes, 'no escape from reality' totally fits.However, 'Suicide Squad' isn't entirely without merits and there are a couple of decent moments to be found. Some of the acting is pretty good too, Will Smith manages to be effortlessly watchable even when he's in a bad mood, while Jai Courtney actually manages to make his antipodean answer to Snake Plissken likable. Shame he's called 'Captain Boomerang' and has been saddled with a truly rubbish gimmick, he makes a good antihero when not playing square- jawed heroes.If the film absolutely gets one thing right though, it's Harley Quinn. From the minute she first appears, sitting in a homemade hammock in the middle of an isolation block and flirting murderously with her guards, Margot Robie's performance is spot-on. She's equal parts psychotic and childish, as memorable as Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker in 'The Dark Knight' and they couldn't have picked a better actress to play her. 'Suicide Squad' might be a long way from perfect, but it does create an instant icon and it's no surprise that 2016 saw legions of lookalikes turning up at Halloween parties.As good as Robie is though, it's impossible to deny that 'Suicide Squad' is a bad film. It's a massive missed opportunity and can't make up it's mind if it wants to be free-wheeling comic anarchy or a deep, tormented soul. Imagine watching a dismal stand-up comedian who looks suspiciously similar to a wanted murderer for two hours and you'll get the idea. It's made enough money to fund a real super-villain however so a sequel is inevitable, let's hope it's better than this turgid effort. Margot Robie really is good though."
" Flashy but that's mostly it
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,5,"This movie had a lot of special effects and action, but the plot was fairly poor, and there were a lot of things that didn't make sense. Characters didn't really seem to stay in character and made some strange decisions at times. I feel like this movie could have showcased the specific villains a bit more, especially with their powers and techniques."
" The Right Idea, But Still Not That Good
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,3,"DC had the right idea with ""Suicide Squad"". They really did. Instead of the plodding seriousness of films like ""Man of Steel"" or ""Batman vs. Superman"", this one was meant to let loose and have a little fun. While it did accomplish that goal, unfortunately it just isn't a very good film, overall.For a basic plot summary, ""Suicide Squad"" sees government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) put together a team of mercenaries to do some dirty work so that the government won't have to get it's own hands dirty. Ostensibly led by Deadshot (Will Smith) and prominently featuring Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), this group of ragtag ""bad guys"" tries to thwart a plan hatched by the evil Enchantress (Cara Delavigne). Lurking on the fringes of everything? The Joker (Jared Leto), stirring up trouble everywhere he goes.There is a lot of fun to be had in this movie (especially during the first half of runtime). Director David Ayer creates a wacky, madcap atmosphere with all the crazy pieces falling into place, and it really is a lot of fun. Smith has the perfect personality for Deadshot, while Robbie's Quinn is easily the best thing to come out of the whole experience. Leto's Joker is engaging, and just the entire concept is fresh and new.Sadly, things take a real nosedive after that solid first half. As soon as a plot needs to be introduced, the whole thing falls apart. Maybe the saddest part of the whole ordeal? They seemed to be very correctable mistakes that just weren't identified and fixed. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I can't go too deep into what I felt were late-film mistakes, but the biggest faux pas for me was that the tenor of certain characters really changed from beginning to end. Not helping matters is that there isn't anything resembling the word ""deep"" in the whole movie. So, basically, as soon as things have to start making sense and adding up...they don't.I really wish I could give ""Suicide Squad"" a higher rating than this (2.5 stars would be my exact mark), but I just can't because, as a whole, it doesn't deserve it. It establishes an interesting Joker, an incredible Harley, and has a bit of fun in the first half...but that isn't enough to make it a great film. I know that rumors of studio meddling plagued this project until practically up to the release date, so perhaps that had a lot to do with why the tone seemed to change so much at times and why the characterizations seemed a bit off from beginning to end.The final verdict: If Leto's Joker, Robbie's Quinn, and Affleck's Batman were to have a movie to themselves (with perhaps Smith's Deadshot lurking in the corners), that would be something to get excited about. Everything else in ""Suicide Squad"" is either a total miss or decidedly lukewarm."
" Better than I expected, but far from what it might have been
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,7,"Maybe it was the vicious reviews that led me to over compensate and be somewhat pleasantly surprised by this. Of course, I'm not the core audience, being well into middle age and not generally a fan of the comic book movie universe. That once very entertaining world now feels played out and repetitive to me, no matter how high tech the special effects. But I did love Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy- largely for hijacking and making fun of the formulas. And that's probably why I liked (not loved) Suicide Squad. While not as successful at biting the hand that bore it as those other two comic films that refused to play by the rules, it still has fun with darkness and light and all our preconceptions about heroes and villains. Indeed, it could have been flat out terrific, but two substantive problems held it back. First, the core plot is as silly, illogical and uninspiring as any in the weakest of the genre. Just because the film is more about the characters than the story doesn't mean there's couldn't have been something a little more imaginative to hang the tale on.And, perhaps even more damningly, for a film that purports to be a sort of 'Dirty Dozen' of the comic book world, its villains turned anti-heroes are nowhere near 'anti' enough. They're all entertaining lightweights in the moral division. If they've done bad things you can be sure it was always for good reasons and/or they feel really bad about it. Instead of forcing us into the juicy, morally messy joy of forcing us relate to some really bad 'heroes', these are more misunderstood victims with superpowers then Walter Whites who happen to also be able to make things fly or explode. And that's too bad, because with more bite, edge and embrace of punky anarchy this could have been that rare popcorn movie is truly subversive, instead one that mildly, if sometimes entertainingly, play acts at it."
" Lots of Problems
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,7,"I'm not going to try to defend this movie in any way. It has plenty of problems, so much that viewers can see the cracks behind the curtains: it's become famous for its poor editing and all the scenes that were cut. I agree with all the criticisms and some of them do bother me. But on the whole, I ended up enjoying this movie. Not totally sure why, because I haven't cared about any of the other DC movies lately, but I just did. Will Smith's performance is grating, the lack of Joker is frustrating, and there are plenty of moments that make no sense, but I enjoy watching back anyway."
" This film should never have been released.
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,1,"Suicide Squad is a brilliant example of a failed film. The story makes no sense at all, the characters make no sense and the whole experience just leaves you asking how a film can go this wrong and still get released. It seems like several different scripts were filmed, then edited together into three or four different films that were then chopped down and put into a single, confusing film. Some plot points are set up, but never resolved. While other scenes in the film seem to be the resolution of a plot point whose setup was left out of the film. And it's not, as one critic hypothesizes, that this is the results of comic book writers let loose in the movie business. Im a longtime DC comics reader and this film was every bit the confusing mess to me, as it was for casual moviegoers."
" Great movie that was over criticized.
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,7,"A great movie that was vastly over criticized. Sure many moments felt pushed, characters were different than previous beloved incarnations, and some shots could've used more direction. It has it's flaws, but no more than every other movie out there now. Many of it's problems are easily overlooked. I feel like it's biggest flaw was building up such impossibly high hopes, well, that and Jared leto. Still, it's a perfect addition to any superhero movie collection. Every bit as good as previous beloved dc movies as long as you take off your nostalgia glasses and give this movie an honest chance."
" no means no
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,1,"This movie is just horrible, and I still can't figure out what parts a moviegoer or their children are supposed to like. So the government hand picks a super-crew of supuh-freekay felons to stop the threat of Superman doing evil? This film would have been more entertaining if instead they showed the joker spend 2 hours of the movie lining up his guns all over the floor and carving hahahaha all over the walls. It is hard to figure out what super power Will Smith has. A guy who can operate an aim sight isn't a superhero, he's an average American. I give this 1 star because at least these geniuses didn't try to force Keanu Reeves to talk normal in this POS. I read on another popular review site how most people love this movie and the reviews are unfair, so I decided there aren't enough people actually expressing their opinions."
" Bad reviews for good movie
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,8,"7.5 at least.I don't know why this movie is getting SO many despicable reviews. Maybe it's fan boys or just trolls. I was pretty negative about this movie going in, I read the plot and the reviews and decided it was a CD quality. The thing that turned me off the most were the trailers! Then I caught it on a pay site and found that it is certainly entertaining. I dare say that, if you had caught this at the theater, and you like the genre, then you would have walked out happy to have seen it. I will buy the CD. This is one where, most of, the reviewers got it wrong. Ignore any review below 4 they are just trying to rob you or the movie maker. See it for yourself. It is definitely worth your time."
" Really long movie trailer
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,3,"Really disappointed by DC after watching Man of Steel and Batman trilogy eagerly waiting for Suicide Squad. Just going to point out pros and cons (mostly cons) David Ayer's terrible direction, Jared Leto's great effort as joker, too much CGI, terrible script, At the end,felt like watching 2hr movie trailer."
" Enjoyable Watch on a Good Entertainment System
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,8,"Just wanted to say that I think people need to post how they watched a movie in order for us to take the review seriously, I mean this sort of a film looked awesome on my 55"" Sony Bravia in 3D with a surround sound setup, however if I was watching it on a 14"" laptop or 5m away from a small 32"" TV with no soundbar then it may not have been so appealing because this sort of audio visual movie is designed for maximum impact on a decent set up.Of course I can appreciate movies with an emotional content and a developed story, but these sorts of movies aren't the reason I bought a 55"" 4K 3D TV and have 5 full range B&W speakers. The fact was simply that while watching this movie on my awesome set up, my senses were so overloaded with the joy of the visuals, the booming soundtrack and explosive effects that at no point did I ever feel like questioning anything.So if you didn't find this thoroughly enjoyable because you didn't watch it on a decent set up then maybe you need to go shopping or just stay away from action/sci-fi movies. Okay yes the plot was a bit ridiculous and had a lot of holes but the effort in this movie was put into cool characters and pure raw audio visual entertainment."
" wowie
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,3,"this movie was fearless and crazier than even batman VS superman, it was DC's queen and god help anyone that dared watch suicide squad because the might possibly commit suicide over the waist of money that is this horribly made s**t show filled with actors that aren't actors and bad quotes.they had 20 main characters and they don't get passed introductions with any of them. all the dialogue sounded like a 12 year olds jokerxreader fanfiction that she wrote while she was sick at home and drooling from pain meds, and despite the ""cool powers"" they were all given out of some edgy c***s ocs on deviant art they couldn't for the life of them do anything well, i honestly don't remember if they killed a single thing or just talked about how they kill things. I had to cover my eyes because harley quinns outfit was so desperately trying to look cool and sexy that it lacked any ounce of reason-ability and left me with second hand embarrassment.my tribute to the script writers(good job really):""i'm not gonna kill you, i'm just gonna hurt you really really bad"" -this movie did indeed hurt me really really bad.""we're bad guys... it's what we do"" - i really like the in-depth approach they took to these characters and spending time explaining why they took to crime!""what was that? I should kill everyone and escape? sorry the voices"" this the edgiest thing I've ever heard and kid's at my school listen to fallout boy so i know what i'm talking about.I wouldn't wish this kind of failure on my worst enemy, too bad my worst enemy is jared leto and hes sat at home taking about how the haters just couldn't understand the true crazy and it was all too much for them. i feel sorry for anyone involved."
" Insanity
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,8,"The suicide squad has been around for a long time now, and it's great that they managed to create a movie with all these characters! While I do not follow the comics, I do watch some of the superhero series, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is, in my opinion, very stylish and so well put together.The best part of the movie for me was, hands down, Harley Quinn. There is a great cast in this, and I wouldn't have imagined that Margot Robbie could pull off such a perfect Harley. Her persona, and her delivery certainly embodies the character, and she did such a tremendous job. Leto as Joker as well, was magnificent. It must be something about the crazy factor that makes it so captivating. Other cast embodied their characters well too, though none stood out like Harley Quinn did for me. The other great thing about this film is how stylish it is. Visuals and editing are on point, and most importantly- the soundtrack adds so much personality to the film. Just by watching the trailer, you get a sense of the kind of cheekiness that is embedded into the atmosphere. Which I think is mostly due to the fact that the Joker and Harley are unpredictable. Anyway, there is great music that accompanies the movie and adds to its style.I've seen mixed reviews for the film, and admittedly, the story itself isn't very good. The hook for this movie though, is the all star cast portraying various big shot comic characters. I loved it, simply because it's a fun film with a bit of darkness, but in essence encompasses the DC world. I liked how other superheroes (Batman, and the Flash) would casually make appearances, and there would already be that sense of history present, like it is in the comics. So overall, not a great story, but a fantastic squad and a well made film."
" More Dark DC
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,7,"Since Spider-man made big bucks followed by Iron Man a few years later the blockbuster to beat has become the comics based genre. Marvel has done a marvelous job of creating some memorable movies that thrill audiences. DC on the other hand, the home of Batman and Superman, hasn't had the same luck with their reboots of those series.A large part of that is because of the tone with which the stories their using take. Rather than embrace the format they were derived from, comic books, it's as if DC wants to reimagine every character and go only for the grittiest most realistic form for these characters to take. I was disappointed with MAN OF STEEL because Superman suddenly was more concerned about the battle than saving lives. BATMAN V SUPERMAN continued this type of story with Batman suddenly killing people, a major no no for fans of the comics.When I heard they were doing a movie of SUICIDE SQUAD I wondered what they would do. The story in comics form had a secret government agency that employed super villains in covert operations. The end result was a lessening of their sentences and a deniable group that could pull of various jobs. Some of that is employed in this film but again, that dark, gritty, edgy feeling permeates the movie and does more harm than good.Viola Davis stars as Amanda Waller, a notoriously heartless government bureaucrat, who wants to form the team in this film. She goes through the list of who she wants on the team as she discusses the project with her superiors. This fills up screen time and allows us to get the back story on each of the members she brings along. The first of the two main bad guys she chooses is Floyd Lawton aka Deadshot. Wil Smith takes on the role but offers a character a bit more human than the cold hearted killer for hire he reads as in the comics. Almost a comparable character to Deadpool, Deadshot in the books has a mouth but in the film plays it less for laughs and more for emotion. His daughter means everything to him.The second main character on display is Harleen Quinzel aka Harley Quin (Margot Robbie). A psychologist who was studying Batman nemesis The Joker (Jared Leto), he drove her mad and she became the moll to his gangster. Seriously crazy she acts the part, cracking wise and inclined to do bodily harm as well as quip jokes about what is happening around her. But deep inside Harley also has a ton of emotions she carries in her love of The Joker.Once approved a mission pops up involving another super villain Waller thought she had control of, The Enchantress. An ancient being bodily tied to an archaeologist June Moone, Waller had straight man and hero material leader Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) become involved with June romantically to help keep her in line. Flag is the non-villain of the group, put in charge of them to make sure they follow through with the plan. In addition to that, each has been tagged with a collar that will explode if they don't follow through to keep them in line.Once everyone is identified and given a chance to demonstrate their powers and give us their back story the movie progresses. The group is taken from their cells and rounded up be dropped in the city where a major paranormal event is going on. The Enchantress has taken on her form and brought back her brother with the hopes of finding her heart, returning it to her chest and then taking her vengeance on mankind.While informative the first half of the movie moves along fairly slow. It does give us a chance to see Batman (Ben Affleck) and the Flash in brief moments setting them up for the next movie, JUSTICE LEAGUE. But it could have taken less time and that bogs down that part of the movie. Whereas that part seems slow the second half has a pace only slightly faster but filled with plenty of explosions and special effects. At times the action is so over the top and non-stop that it becomes tiresome. The only stand out moment for me here was seeing Deadshot in action, putting on a display of how he came by the name.Of the characters Deadshot comes off as sort of bland which is sad knowing the history of the character. Smith can do a great job with something solid but this wasn't it. Robbie as Harley stands out among the pack displaying a wonderful joy to the insanity of the character that ties directly with her behavior in the comics. It's no wonder that there is talk of her being part of a trio of Gotham bad girls in a future film. The rest of the bad guys feel like an afterthought. With a few good stories to them those deserving more screen time seem limited and those who don't seem there all the time.But as I said at the start the film feels mired in its desire to be dark and dirty rather than the four color comic that it was taken from. Come on DC, realize that most comic fans aren't into the whole dark side. Check out what Marvel is doing and regroup. This may not be the worst comic book movie ever made, it is okay in the long run. But it could have been better, actors could have been given more to work with and it could have stood out rather than feel like just another movie. It was worth watching as a comic fan and probably will be for action film fans as well. But it wasn't good enough that I'd want to make it a part of my permanent collection."
" What A Disappointment ...
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,2,"I was quite looking forward to this movie when I saw the commercial because the movie seemed different and I was interested in seeing how the heck they were going to make a good film out of such an absurd idea! I've seen it done before for though for example, Miss Congeniality. I thought that movie was going to be a stink bomb that would never wash off society or myself but I actually really loved that movie, I know I was shocked to! Anyways I had high hope's for Suicide Sqaud and I was sadly disappointed! My Hope that the Director would make a unique film that turned out awesome was sadly not the case, This movie sucked! The plot was everywhere, the comedy that was added to this supposedly dark film definitely didn't work for me and overall the movie definitely didn't come close to the expectations I had for it! Anyways my advice don't see this film. I truly believe you will be disappointed..."
" I Was In A Viola Davis Mood.
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,5,"Yes, this film was over hyped and blown up to be something it wasn't. DC could have done a way better job with this film. I hope this isn't a sign of some sort of how DC is going to compete with Marvel because if it is Marvel is already victorious. I'm not a comic book fan but I'm fond of some of the films that are made from them. So far ""Suicide Squad"" is the third installment of the DC Extended Universe and so far I'm not really impressed or at least impressed as I was with some of the Marvel films when they came out. The one thing that really made me go out and see this film was Viola Davis' performance. I knew no matter how awful this film might be Viola Davis would stand out. As usual her performance was phenomenal! She's really the only reason I decided to see this film. Actually, this film was comprised of a great cast. Along with Viola Davis there was Jared Leto (The Joker), Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) and Will Smith (Deadshot). Other than that this film is the wrong direction for DC."
" Film Review: Suicide Squad
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,2,"In a world where audiences cannot get enough of superheroes, comics and geeking over the impossibly feverish fade of comic book hero's adapted onto the big screen, DC Comics is trying to cash in on this highly lucrative cinematic craze by developing a feature length feature, and their competition to The Avengers with Suicide Squad. Yet, if we really look at the bigger picture of Suicide Squad, one can easily see some stark differences, for example; none of the characters are really superheroes but villains; none of the characters presented are really recognizable names, with the exception of The Joker (who isn't even a member of the squad in the film) and Harley Quinn (who is destined to become a household character by the end of this film, with the help of Margot Robbie of course), and, if not most importantly, assembling a team together, including cast and crew, that couldn't be more, disassembled.Quite frankly, Suicide Squad is a complete disaster and mess of a film. The writing of the film is so incoherent, it makes the objective of the team and the audience really question as to why they are doing it altogether. The direction of the film feels forced and almost lacking any artistic creativeness by David Ayer and more-so of a forced studio film shoved down the artistic team's throat, and, the story is just convoluted, discombobulated and weak. Ayer, who was on my radar of becoming one of my fav directors, blending, almost effortlessly, the use of action with real-world comedy, thanks to the near-perfect End of Watch, shits the bed on this one.With such star power, including the uncompromising Will Smith, Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, and the once attached Tom Hardy, you would think Suicide Squad was a film with some massive potential to wreck box-office havoc at the end of a very disappointing 2016. Yet, the film itself is a very sad excuse for a summer blockbuster, insulting its audience with any sort of artistic and cinematic credit.While the narrative of the story has been told before, like seriously, almost exactly like the narrative in the first Avengers. Just to refresh, here is it; A loved one of one of the team members (Thor's brother's Loki in the Avengers and Nick Flag's (Joe Kinnaman) girlfriend June Moone, also know by her villain name Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) in this one, wreck havoc on a city, a team gathers to save the city (New York City in the Avengers, Gotham in this film). Coming out of the gates, the film does not have much street credit.Suicide Squad was easily one of the most anticipated and exciting movies of summer sixteen. The trailer, which features one of the best bands ever assembled singing one of the best musical arrangements ever created, was easily one hell of a ride to watch. Unfortunately, some of the best parts of the film were featured in the trailer, which took away and ruined the film overall, or, the music just brought the best in the footage. After all, its pretty hard not enjoying watching anything while listening to the angelic voice of Freddie Mercury.While the movie did feature the likes of Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, the sadistic mastermind behind the formation of the Suicide Squad, in a compelling and completely engaging role as a devilish, heartless and soulless women, who takes her job WAY too seriously, the only real redemption the movie has is Will Smith and Margot Robbie, and I mention those named quite carefully. Notice how I didn't say Deadshot and Harley Quinn, the characters these actors are playing. Smith, who is an excellent actor whom audiences love whole-heartedly, did not play an interpretation of the almost obscure comic book character. Smith, in turn, essentially just plays himself, in a film adaptation where he must kick ass, save the world and give the occasional motivational speech. Its hard not to like Will Smith in anything really (we will completely ignore After Earth), hence why much of the good criticism will come from him, but people will quickly forget that Will Smith is a likable guy, but did he give a spot on, target approve depiction of a DC comic book baddie, heck no.With Margot Robbie, one of the hottest and most attractive Hollywood actresses working today, its hard not to like her in anything, especially when for the duration of the film, she is featured in very sexy short-shorts and ripped nylons, as well as while the camera takes the liberty of shooting her from behind most of the time. Geeks and fanboys, compose yourself! Again, Robbie, A HIGHLY alluring and charming actress, who, if wasn't already, will surely be a house hold name after only one studio film, plays the best version of herself, with some sort of an accent, doesn't really play a version of the iconic sidekick to The Joker, rather, just an amazing companion to Deadshot, which shouldn't be hard, especially since the two have shared the screen before in Focus, showing the same caliber chemistry as Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. The chemistry between the two is so good, it comes to no wonder why Jada Pinkett Smith was worried when rumours were circulating about affair rumours between the two."
" A typical case of the trailer being better than the movie. Period.
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,4,"After having watched the trailer, I felt excited to watch the movie as the trailer promised a comedy movie x just a little bit of drama x lots of action x a well structured plot. After months of waiting, however, I sat down to watch the movie and I can't express how disappointed I was.It appears as if film makers and editors put all the best bits of a film in the trailer, including all the funniest jokes and most comical scenes. The rest of the movie did not live up to the standard set by the trailer as I was watching a movie with a poorly constructed plot, unrealistic scenes (diablo in the end, Enchantress and her slave ""brother"", the ""unexpected"" killing of enchantress by Harley). What a joke. Combine low-level thinking with a desperate attempt to outshine ""Deadpool"" and you will end up with Suicide Squad. Sorry guys, not impressed. I was bored throughout the movie and was desperate for it to stop, but deep down inside I was still hoping for a solid resolution of the movie or the introduction of a ""secret"" character, or at least something to bring life back to the movie."
" Review of the later out put of the DC Universe V2
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,6,"When Suicide Squad first came out I thought that was OK and enjoyable ,but now after long and hard thoughts I change my mind and saw the mess that it is , although I find some enjoyment watching it, it was more of the type ""It is so bad it's good"" rather than a genuine an appreciation for a good product.But because I am not a negative man out of nature I will start with the things that I liked and were good in the film. Firstly Viola Davis as Amanda Waller was a great casting choice and she was the bossy bureaucrat that comic fan we know and love to hate. Will Smith was good as Deathshot and not with out the usual over acting by his part. Even Jai Courtney made a good job as Captain Boomerang (no clue how but it happened). And also they were some decent action scenes here and there, specially in the middle. And that's all the good.As for the drawbacks wow boy does it have a lot and I can't recall them all so I will point out the obvious and most prominent. For starter where the character development? There is almost none. Then there is Harley Quin and the new Joker. Margot Robbie dispute the fact she did her best her Harley was quit obnoxious in the end.Not that I blame Robbie for that she was trying and with a better script could can excellent so keep her! As for the Joker he was in for what a quarter of an hour and this isn't the Joker, it was his loser cousin for Pim my Ride. And in the end I see no squad no team ,no camaraderie, nothing ,we haven't a real team. To go with the technical aspects effects were on part with those of Gods of Egypt ,that hurt much my eyes.To continue sometimes I couldn't tell what was happening during the fights due to the editing ,the coloring (which was dirty and ugly to look at) and the lighting. To close the technicalities I muss address the editing ,damn it was quit broken and uneven but I won't blame the directorial team for they had only six weeks to write the script and edit the film so they had their hands full.All in all the third film in the DC cinematic universe wasn't very good and over all continues the trend of DC sucks. For real Warner Bros. and DC pull your head from your ass and make a good flick."
" Worst movie ever
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,1,I am going to keep this short and sweet. If not the worst film in 2016 probably the worst film to come out in my lifetime and I'm 26! it makes batman vs superman Oscar worthy in comparison. Its so bad that its almost as if the movie was a fan made video made on YouTube. they are killing great dc comics when will they learn.I never write reviews but this one I FELT COMPELLED TO SO NO ONE WASTES THEIR MONEY OR TIME.And I've checked that they will be making another one in 2019 if it's anything like that and with the same cast then I don't want to know too be brutally honest.Will Smith will be re-watching that and shaking his head in embarrassment.
" Short on concept, rife with stereotypes, bad one-liners, re-shoots, we saw this coming.
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,5,"If the daily set photos and re-shoots were not red alarms, the first fifteen minutes of Suicide Squad will quickly set them off. Suicide Squad is a mess.The first act is very poorly edited. I chalk this up to lose foreshadowing for later on, and the director getting panned by WB to keep it PG-13. Rough jump shots occur to introduce characters that are somehow NOT introduced well, with the ensemble getting shafted to give Robbie and Smith the most screen time. The the initial premise is totally unbelievable; CIA operative trying to recruit the baddest of the bad to take down... Superman? Batman? JL? I'm not too sure, because Batman is part of the recruiting process in this. Predators has a more convincing plot than Suicide Squad. If the Suicide Squad is the ""contingency plan"" then why are they using Bats to get them and nixing their own agents? It's a huge WTF.Second half, the bad guys start bonding, and we get the rebel with a heart of gold syndrome. Problem is not all of them are on-board. Only two of them are remotely likable because the others have been snubbed for screen time, and it's hard to convince us one minute that Harley Quinn gives a sh*t and the next she wants to run off with Mista Jaaay. This goes into the third act as well until the finale.Third act has the least issues and I think this is what Ayer really had in mind; the villains cooperating to take on something bigger. Unfortunately, The Dragon in this movie, sucks. I won't spoil who it is, but come on. Screenwriters have got to start setting up villains properly over the course of multiple movies. One-shot-evil-just-because doesn't work. Not in Marvel, not in DC. If you disliked Whiplash in IM2, you won't be too keen on the real antagonist. (Also, why the weird dancing? If it's too recreate Santanico Pandemonium, try again.) I did kind of like Robbie in this, she's very attractive with her glasses on. But she was overall just annoying. And surprisingly, Hernandez and Jai Courtney for once are the most standout. The other (including Smith and Leto) are just bleh. Smith didn't play Deadshot. Smith played Will Smith. Killer Croc was a huge racial stereotype, Leto growled at people and acted like a weird drug lord (NOT an anarchist), and the other supporting cast were just not quite there. They actually decapitate a Native American guy (who can apparently climb anything) who's part of the Squad without introducing him! Move over NAACP, NCAI would like to talk with Warner.Lastly, the one liners. The effing one-liners! Stahp. My only theory is they were trying to recreate the magic from The Dark Knight trilogy and wound up somewhere around Batman & Robin.So yeah, not my CB movie of the year. Ayer has done better, and I suspect that WB (yet again) tied his hands. He has admitted that the character concept for Joker wasn't right. Hoping, but not holding my breathe for Affleck's Batman movie. But if MoS, BvS, and now SS are any indication, we may not be to far off from another re-re-reboot."
" Too Much Chaos, Too Little Plot
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,8,"I liked it but...There was too much detracting from what could've been a good story. Perhaps too many characters. When there's a large cast, it's difficult to give each player enough screen time so much of it had to be condensed into a few moments voice-over and a brief scene of his/her origin.They say you can't tell the layers without a program but in this one, even with the explanation of who everyone is, it's never clear why they're doing what they're doing. This is a movie in which the bad guys are bad and the good guys badder, but the so-called villains have their own set of morals while the good guys have none. (Naturally the ruthless are the ones in power.) While I liked the characters, the plot...was there really one? Since this was supposed to (apparently) be after the story in which Superman is killed, these characters are ""recruited"" to take his place. Having nowhere seen or heard of a movie about that event--did I miss it? Does it exist?--the viewers are subjected to a brief shot of a funeral cortege as explanation, and that's all.The plot is confusing. Muddled would be a kind way to describe it. It seems to go in one direction, then abruptly switch to another. The ""mission"" is said to be one thing, it quickly deteriorates into something else, though exactly what isn't clear, except that the Witch is involved. Adding to the confusion, there are flashbacks inserted in such a way they seem part of the action until they dissolve back into the present. Frankly, I'd liked to have seen more of the Joker. He seemed the most ""sane"" part of the story, and that's saying an ironic lot.While the various members of the suicide squad are good and the brief explanations of their backstories helpful, though Deadshot's is the only one explored in true depth, this movie was a disappointment because it seemed aimless, merely an excuse for explosive special effects and merely introducing characters, as if a ""trial run"" to see how audiences accepted them, perhaps in preparation for a movie with a true plot in which they again star.Score 8 stars for characterization; it would've been 10 if there had been some reason in all this chaos.This movie was viewed as a rental DVD and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review."
" I just...don't know what to say...
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,2,"So, I finally did it. I bit the bullet and watched Suicide Squad--the Extended Cut. And...it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. That doesn't mean it wasn't still terrible, but it was a hell of a lot better than Batman v Superman. In fact, if it wasn't set in the world of Batman v Superman, it might almost be an enjoyable movie. Here's my review.Grade: 6.5/10, C-Story: 5/10 First of all, there was a good story in this movie beneath the morass of mediocrity. You could see glimpses and glimmers of greatness that just completely went away whenever any of the characters opened their mouths to speak. The villain was probably the worst part of this movie, though, and without a good villain, you just don't have good heroes--even anti-heroes. And that was the other problem--they kept calling the Suicide Squad villains, yet they were more misguided than anything. No one was truly evil, even the main villain, who...*shakes his head* I just...I just...I have no clue what they were trying to do with her. I really don't. A magical being who was trying to use technology to destroy the world. That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and it makes even less sense as you're watching the movie.Character Development: 5/10 Again, you could see glimpses of greatness in the characters that just vanished the second they spoke. Deadshot and Harley Quinn were the two they concentrated on the most, but they really had no life or charm to them. You could see glimpses of life and charm, but it vanished as quickly as you saw it. Amanda Waller was...sorta okay I guess, but there were about twelve times when I had to ask myself why Deadshot didn't just kill her. I mean, was one of the military guys going to go over, pick up the device to blow their heads off, and press it himself? I don't think so because everyone hated Waller! Especially her subordinates! And Diablo was supposed to have this tragic story, but his story did not make sense because you assumed he burned his family alive, yet when he was holding his wife, she was perfectly fine--not a hair singed on her head--until she just turned to ash and vanished. I was like...what? And let's not forget the Joker--the worst interpretation of the Joker I've ever seen in my life. Enough said. I hope the rumors that Jared Leto won't return to the DCEU are true.Direction: 6/10 David Ayer almost had a good movie here. Almost. Another six rewrites, and he might have had a good movie, but he didn't. He had two-thirds of a good movie, which is surprising to me. But that one-third really, really, REALLY hurt this movie badly. The story wasn't told well by him, with far too much exposition and repeated exposition that just could have been handled better. And a lot of things in the movie happened JUST BECAUSE. I hate movies that demand a leap in logic from you because leaps in logic usually ended with a splat at the bottom.Casting: 5/10 Casting in this movie was decent and terrible. Joker, terrible. Will Smith, decent. Margot Robbie, decent. Jai Courtney, good. Everyone else...eh.Acting: 5/10 The acting was probably better than I'm giving it, but the actors did annoy me a tiny bit. Margot Robbie's accent kept slipping in an out. Will Smith was not Deadshot--he was Will Smith. Jared Leto was absolutely atrocious at the Joker, and I want to hurt the people who cast him as the Joker and decided to portray the Joker that way. He was not the Joker. He was someone trying to be the Joker but failing miserably. The guy playing Rick Flag was...kind of atrocious but...that could have just been his characters? I'm not sure. And the actress who played June Moon/Enchantress needs to never work in Hollywood again--ever.Cinematography: 9/10 The movie looked good, other than the floating rocks in the sky, which we really don't need to see any more of, and the horrible way the Enchantress looked and moved. The bellydancing was really, truly not needed.Music: 7/10 I really don't know how to score the music, because the songs used in the movie were great, they were just used poorly. You could see they were going for a Guardians of the Galaxy vibe, but GotG used its music so much better. The regular background music was good, though.Pacing: 10/10 The movie didn't drag like I was expecting it to. Good job there!Sets and Costumes: 7/10 I'm taking points off for the massive amounts of tattoos the Joker and Harley had. I hate tattoos to begin with, but the amount covering their bodies was almost obscene. And we know the Joker is damaged--did he had to have it tattooed across his forehead? Harley's costume wasn't as cute as she wanted it to be, either. Deadshot's was fine. Everyone else's was...eh.Enjoyment: 6/10 My enjoyment of the movie was a lot higher than I was expecting, but not high enough that I'd ever bother watching this movie again. Another entry in the DCEU that should never have been made-- or at least made better than it was. It was still better than Batman v Superman, though. God, I still have nightmares about that monstrosity of a movie."
" Suicide Squad******
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,6,"The third installment into the DCEU, David Ayer's Suicide Squad, I enjoyed it. Of course the movie was far from perfect, but what film is? The story line to me was fairly straight forward, but all the actors brought their A+ game. Margot Robbie killed it as Harley Quinn, I love Margot Robbie's & Jared Leto's dynamic when they share the screen together. What of Jared Leto's Joker? I personally thought he was good, along the line of Mark Hamill's Joker. Elements of Brian Azzerello's & Lee Bermejo's Joker. Did he blow me away like Heath Ledger from The Dark Knight? Unfortunately, he didn't but to me that's due to him not having enough screen time to shine, but that's understandable, considering he's not apart of the Suicide Squad in the comics, only meant to be apart of Harley Quinn's story. Definitely has room to improve though & I love that duo though. Will Smith is Will Smith, he was great as Deadshot. Viola Davis from How to Get Away with Murder plays Amander Waller who's the one responsible for forming Task Force X, she nailed that role to the bone. I think the surprises, wild cards, were Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag, Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang, & Jay Hernandez's Diablo, definitely. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's Killer Croc & Karen Fukuhara's Katana to me was cool but only served more as action set pieces. A lot of reviewers said Cara Delevingne didn't shine as Enchantress, I actually kind of liked her role more than expected. The movie was actually a little bit of a tearjerker, had some moments. Overall as I said, I did enjoyed it, it was actually a fun movie. I'd also like to point out that David Ayer did a great job of choosing the music for the movie, props to him, and the score by Steven Price was absolutely great too."
" Awesome movie!
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,10,"I don't know what kind of drugs all you people are on, but you need to switch dealers. This movie was one of the best I've seen in a long time. I don't care for most of the ""super hero"" movies, but this one was really good. Ya know, you can only do so many Batman movies before it's, been there, done that. I'm glad Superman is dead, that crap was old 20 years ago. If you wanna see those type of movies, go watch one of the 50 that's already out there. And Jared Leto whining about most of his Joker scenes getting cut...Good! That's another character that's been beat into the ground. And sorry bud, the only good Joker was Jack Nicholson. To all you people whining about how bad the movie was...Grow up and get a life. It was good and you know it."
" After watching this,suicide could be the answer
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,4,"Maybe the worst movie I've been hyped to watch for a very long time!Bad plot,bad story telling,pretentious acting,over the top for no reason,a lot of completely unnecessary scenes and characters.Most of these villains were pretty much useless,like captain b...Some could have made a difference but the dialogue and scenario was pathetic.Robin made a despicable Harley queen.After watching this I really cannot understand why so much fuss for the whole movie and especially for Harley and joker.Silly lines all over the place,introduction scenes that meant nothing,no character development and the scenario was completely childish.So we are supposed to believe that the world was to be saved by a boomerang throwing mad man,a slutty dressed female baseball player,a samurai with bad taste in costumes and a crocman?I did not like most of the characters but especially for Jared and robin,every time they appeared on screen, I honestly begged for them to die in some way so I would not have to suffer another minute of their horrifying acting and the terrible way the director chose to portray the joker and Harley.Totally pretentious and the romantic factor was the silliest addition one could make.This movie ended leaving me sad and confused.My girlfriend even fall asleep!!(Go figure)...Sad because I was so hyped and expected so much more from all these characters.And confused because,how could such a distasteful movie have gotten so much hype and exciting reviews?? JUST HOW???Joker was a big letdown and Harley even more.I guess that's why every irrelevant person on this planet loved her and dressed like her during Halloween.....Makes sense....The good side is it had some decent visual effects and some nice explosions.Also Will Smith's acting was kinda nice but weak story line and dialogue here as well.Other than that it was a waste of time and expectations."
" A Love Story?
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,10,It was a great joy watching this movie as I always took it to be a love story between Harley Quinn and the Joker. Margot Robbie played Harley Quinn and I love her innocence. She portrayed Harley as a friendly but edgy woman that was trying to get through life. Harley seemed like she wanted to learn about love and being social. Like she wants to learn how to live in this world. Loved all of Harley Quinn's innocent moments. The Joker was plain crazy as usual and that's what I expected and loved about him. The interactions between him and Harley were heart felt. I don't know if I can mention a line from the movie here but it was something that I always want to remember. It made me think about the very few relationships I had or tried to have lol. Hearts and emotions should be taken seriously because everyone isn't a threat or trying to damage you. There are some innocent people in this world and I know because I am one of them :).
" Absolutely boring and not worth seeing
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,4,"I were kind of exciting to see this. I've heard good reviews but it wasn't good for sure. It basically had no plot line, no structure at all. I can't believe this movie actually is rated 15+ in our country (between pg-13 and R), and I don't think it fits. It has violence but very dull and not exciting violence. We didn't get to know the characters (I know many of us probably knew them from before) but many of us didn't know about them before. Got really disappointed and won't be seeing it again. According to me it's not worth the time and it's like superhero movies for kids, although the audience clearly isn't for children and they failed on that. It's not exciting enough for older people. 12 year old's can see this because there's no graphic or scary violence which I thought."
" So Bad that it was not even good
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,1,Such a bad movie. Will Smith playing a bad guy just can never happen yet it was attempted in this movie. All you get is Will Smith being Will Smith. The down guy who has a kid trying to make a living.He means well and he cares about his daughter as he is a weekend dad. Dialbo ( the fire guy) has the power to destroy everything yet he wants to be good wants to do good and dose not wanna use his ability for wrong.Turns into a big fire thing an then dies. WHAT!! Slipknot how long was this character on screen for? He appears out of now were and then dies. Soon as you see him you know he is there to die the first.Sort of a oh the thing we have on you works look. Harley Quinn-its as if they said to Margot Robbie just walk around in hot pants and say your lines in a soft girly voice . Done ..Leto-has to go down as the worse Joker ever.Rock Druggie with daddy issues.The laugh WTF!!! The Joker is not rich he dos not drive expansive cars and he dos not chill at nightclubs with other bad guys. The Joker is fared by everyone. Eyebrows were raised when Leto was announce as the joker. When people saw what he would look like you just knew it was gonna be a bad movie. Leto just dose not strike fair he is that soft cute rock singer. The Movie was made for the pop people of today.So no real backstory action and one liners. By the end the bad guys are shown as heroes. It was done for the Harley Quinn wannabes (mostly every girl who likes to dress up) . It felt like a teenage movie with old actors trying to be young or think hey this is my chance to be a comic book character . Now we all know what they can or should never be a comic book character. The end of the movie scene were they kill the witch how long did that slow mo go on for? it has to be the longest slow mo in movie history.I voted 1 as there is no 0 option..
" 'Suicide Squad' commits suicide.
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,3,"There seems to be a good movie hidden somewhere in 'Suicide Squad', but the film itself makes it nearly impossible for you to find where those good moments are. The film is its own worst enemy, because it promises something new and fresh in the first dozen or so minutes, but then nose dives into the mountain from there on out. This is certainly writer/director David Ayer's most ambitious project and I can't tell if it's his mistake or the collection of DC/Warner Bros. executives who forced the notes on him to make this film not succeed, because again, the first part of the movie gathers your hopes up for something fun. Ayer wrote 'Training Day' and 'U-571', then transitioned into directing with 'End of Watch' and 'Fury', which were both new and fresh takes on tired genres. I was hoping that Ayer could breathe new life and put the DC Comic movie franchise on the right track, but alas, that is not the case.That being said, this is a tiny fraction better than 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice', but again, that's not saying much either. I still think one of the worst films in the comic book realm was the recent 'Fantastic Four' remake. That movie on a whole was just terrible on every possible level. It was the worst movie of the year for me. Nothing worked on that film. Here with 'Suicide Squad', Ayer and Warner Bros. had all of the perfect parts to make a great movie, but somewhere in post-production, everything was lost, which makes me just more disappointed in 'Suicide Squad', because they had a ton going for it, but missed the mark, seemingly on purpose. This concept is nothing new with having a team of ""bad guys"" unite to fight something worse for the greater good. Akira Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai' paved the way for this genre, which in turn gave birth to this sub genre that spawned 'The Magnificent Seven' all the way to Marvel's 'Guardians of the Galaxy'.Those films worked on every level of entertainment and filmmaking, where 'Suicide Squad' falls short on almost every account, whether it be the horrendous and cringe worthy dialogue throughout the whole movie, the unbelievably awful plot and relationships that are just flat out silly, to the vast amount of characters who never get any screen time other than a couple of shots of action. It was all a disappointment. Since most people won't know who or what the 'Suicide Squad' is other than big comic book fans with the exception of The Joker (Jared Leto) and maybe Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) , the first part of the film introduces us to all of the characters in a roll call style montage, each with their own flashback of their skill-set, arrest, and pop song. Sometimes, we are introduced to the characters twice, which didn't make sense.Like the trailer, Ayer filmed these biographical sequences with the use of those neon color schemes and the right amount of fun and explosiveness that promised something different that took us out of the dreary, dark, and moody DC universe, but as soon as this segment was over, it was back to dark and brooding in a dilapidated city of no color or even citizens walking around. The characters themselves are all great and have their individuality, but it never goes as far as that really. Sure Deadshot (Will Smith) shows that not only is he the world's deadliest assassin and has a chip on his shoulder in the form of Batman (Ben Affleck), but that he is willing to do anything for his 11 year old daughter, including to show her that he is not a ""bad guy"". That sounds good on paper, but the execution and dialogue is covered in smelly cheese throughout and never really investigates any of this.Jay Hernandez's character El Diablo probably has one of the better backstories, as his power is basically that of the Human Torch, but has now doesn't use his fire power anymore, due to an accident with his family long ago. Again, this wasn't explored as well as it should have been, and instead, we got awful dialogue and a terrible flashback that ended in that dreaded camera shot panning upwards with the character looking up at the camera, screaming, ""NOOOOOOOOOOO"". Another big problem with the film was the villain, who resembled a terrible looking Zuul from 'Ghostbusters'. The problem here is that the evil or ""villain"" part is never explained as to why or what it is, but is rather just thrown in there with the tired use of the sky opening up and everybody and everything being sucked up into the sky. This villain is known as The Enchantress and is basically a witch with powers who in turn has a romantic relationship with the military leader named Flag (Joel Kinnaman).Again, she just owns this character from top to bottom. Her inner chaos and craziness is as good as her softer human side and you can tell she just wants to be accepted in some form or fashion. I'm glad she's getting her own film. Killer Croc's makeup is fantastic, but is only given some throwaway jokes here and there. In fact, the film had some reshoots to make the film funnier due to the backlash on 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice', but it was done in such a lazy manner that you can easily tell where they added the worst and cringe worthy dialogue in to try and make it ""funny"", which it wasn't. Other characters show up out of nowhere and never have anything to do but have some special skill that is never fully utilized or sought out. 'Suicide Squad' promises something good and different in its opening minutes, but then falls flat on its face and never recovers.WAIT FOR NETFLIX!"
" Just a Silly, Fun Action Movie
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,5,"The first mistake you can make while watching this film is to go in with high expectations. The dialogue is simple and plain, the plot is very convenient and juvenile, the characters are silly, and overall, the film just isn't that great if you focus on those things. The fight scenes and action sequences though, are good for what the movie is worth. If you go into this movie wanting to watch something that'll just let you turn your brain off and watch the sexy Harley Quinn and The Joker wreak havoc, then you might just like this one. Don't go in expecting much though. Just try to watch the film for the fun and easy to follow fight scenes, and maybe then you'll get something out of it."

" awful movie, worse than i anticipated
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,1,"I really cant give this movie anything above a 1. it was dreadful from start to finish. The story is pathetic, the acting isn't great and it just lacks everything a dc movie should have. why publicize the joker in this movie? Why have his face on posters, hes hardly in the movie what so ever, and the bits he is in it, he just doesn't work for me, not the joker. just a really stereotypical teenie popper version of him. The movie is 50% deadshot, 45% harley quinn ( who is so annoying) and 5% of the others.The attempt to give a back story to any of the characters doesn't work what so ever, and whatever emotion the movie tries to show between quinn and the joker fails too.The movie really couldn't have been any worse, i was bored to tears watching it, and regret every second i wasted watching it."
" no
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,3,"After convincing myself that this movie might be ( might be ) better than Captain America punching contest, I gave it a shot , but no this was worse far worse . The story is laughable the villain makes no sense ( brother lets kill the humans for no reason at all ) characters were..... really weird , i mean one of them is a skinny girl who goes to fight wearing high heel , and one of them has a boomerang as weapon , WTF? weird explosions and random caviar monsters? dead shot is the most wanted assassin who walks around buys things for his daughter?even though the government knows where he is ? i mean come on , i know these super hero movies are making Hollywood rich but at what cost sooner or later people will come back to their senses and stop watching these craps .P.S : what was the point of the lizard guy ? other than wanting B.E.T."
" Entertaining enough
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,7,"Reading the other reviews, it seems many of those panning this movie are comic book fans who know the comic-book version of these characters and the various movies they have generated. They are deeply involved in the ""Marvel universe"" and the ""DC universe"". Many of them seem to be deeply offended if a movie character differs from their expectations.Well, I'm not in that demographic and I'm not that deeply involved. I came to this movie as someone without that kind of baggage. It even appealed to me that no Marvel character was involved because I'm sick of those movies. I liked the fact that I didn't know any of these characters (well, except for the Joker).To me, this seemed like a typical comic-book movie. Lots of strange superhero-like characters, futuristic technology, action, fighting, explosions and so on.I thought it was a half entertaining film. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone of course, but I can't say I hated it (which is how I feel about any movie with Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Batman, etc.). This movie is not even close to being as good as Galaxy."
" Two's company, three's a crowd and ""Suicide Squad"" is a mess
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,3,"***This review is based on the Extended Cut of the film***DC Entertainment has this superhero movie business all backwards. They've jumped straight to the orgy without taking time to acquaint us more intimately with the individuals. It didn't work all that well in ""Batman vs. Superman,"" but we held out hope that a team- up of lesser-known supervillains under the direction of David Ayer (""End of Watch,"" ""Fury"") could get the DC universe on track. Instead, ""Suicide Squad"" is a mess.No one should be surprised that a movie that juggles at least a dozen characters is messy. What's surprising is that Ayer was the lone screenwriter, which means DC and Warner Bros. liked the script so much they didn't bother to hire anyone to clean it up. Something must've gotten lost in translation from page to screen because the whole thing is scatter-brained and illogical. Given the beats for laughs or ""hell yeah"" action moments, Ayer thinks he has us hooked, but his movie rarely takes hold of anything.""Suicide Squad"" begins with U.S. intelligence officer Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) seeking approval for a project that would assemble a team of ""meta-humans"" that could defend humanity if a threat of Superman's magnitude should ever arise again, and how she has these villains under her thumb. They include hit-man Deadshot (Will Smith), former psychiatrist turned unpredictable criminal Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), a scientific explorer possessed by an evil Enchantress (Cara Delevingne), Aussie thief Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney) fire-starting gangster Diablo (Jay Hernandez), assassin Slipknot (Adam Beach) and man-beast Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). To keep them in line, Waller has military man Captain Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) in charge.Each has a backstory, of course, but not everyone's gets equal attention. Still, countless flashbacks invade the narrative, particularly for Quinn, who has a complicated history with the Joker (Jared Leto), with whom she hopes to be reunited. As integral as The Joker is to Quinn's story, he plays an ancillary role to the main plot, meaning Leto had to don the mantle of one of the most iconic supervillains of all time and endure unending scrutiny for the sake of a sub-plot. Leto's erratic performance is far from the most problematic part of this movie.A weak plot, on the other hand, drags ""Suicide Squad"" down. In essence, Enchantress causes a big supernatural problem and Waller gives the green light to round up her dangerous dream team to extract a VIP in danger from a ""terrorist threat."" There's a disconnect between these threads despite the audience being the wiser.Every part of the story feels disconnected from the other components, and the main conflict has no mystery, energy or momentum at the onset to create any semblance of tension — or entertainment, to be honest. The script settles for verbal jabs between characters over any kind of interesting discord; Ayer is too preoccupied with establishing each of the anti-heroes' personal battles that together they all just scoff at each other and act out their personalities in the form of one-liners. Too few jokes land despite how clear it is that the studio wanted this movie to be funny.Smith and Robbie give the most interesting performances of the bunch, though the script does devote the most time to their motivations and inner-conflicts. Smith relishes the opportunity to play the badass who isn't the hero, even though he becomes the group cheerleader at times. Robbie is the spitting image of Quinn from the the cartoons and comics, and while she's not always funny or effective, she keeps Quinn interesting.Nearly every attempt ""Suicide Squad"" makes to be cool or clever backfires and it's kind of baffling. The only legitimate culprit can be how busy the story gets just trying to give all these characters screen time that it never finds anything compelling enough for them to do. Even the action sequences leave a lot to be desired, primarily because the stakes aren't clear enough. Things start to come together more toward the end when all the sub- plots have converged and we've gotten more acquainted with each character, but it's not enough to provide any redemption.As for the Extended Cut, nothing improves the film or hurts it compared to theatrical version. The bar scene, despite totally deflating any story momentum, has some nice character-building touches. The problem is that when none of the scenes feel essential in a movie, adding more doesn't help.""Suicide Squad"" plays like a series of trailers that are semi-stylish in their own right and set to cool rock music but don't amount to anything on the whole. Scenes don't establish themselves and they lack identity and a role in the greater plot. The movie bounces everywhere and anything that does capture our interest is fleeting as a result. That's the real danger of such a large ensemble movie — it's not that they're always so poorly realized, they just never give enough time to let what works succeed. For as bad as this final product turned out to be, I wouldn't mind a little one-on-one time with any of its characters and their individual stories.~Steven CThanks for reading!

" This time the villains become heroes
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,7,I am normally not a big fan of super heroes. It's always the same and it gets boring after a while. This time you get the villains to be the heroes by saving the earth from another villain. It's a bit different but still you get the feeling that you saw it all before. The action is good though. And that is the only thing that counts in movies like that. To me the best villain to look at was Harley Quinn played by Margot Robbie. She has a touch of humor that does the story good. Otherwise don't expect too much of the movie or the story. Like I said it's all been done before. But for an evening of just relaxing watching some action scenes it's an okay movie. There are way worse movies then this one.
" I gave it a chance and it spat in my face
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,1,"I saw the trailers for this movie and I thought it looked like a confused mess that wasn't sure what it wanted to be. So already my expectations were pretty low, then the movie came out and certain movie review channels I watch gave it a very negative review. However, I decided to go in with an open mind and judge it for myself, and now after having seen it I can say that this movie has nothing and I mean absolutely nothing of value everything this movie does is wrong This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and it's pretty difficult to decide where to start but here we go. The Characters, there's about seven or eight of them and they are the worst part about this movie. Harley Quinn has been given a lot of praise but I honestly don't know why, I found her annoying, cringey and a pathetic representation of a classic character. Speaking about bad representations of great characters let's talk about Jared Leto's Joker. I thought he was embarrassing and it made me want to throw myself down the nearest set of stairs. like Harley Quinn he was cringeworthy and the worst thing ever and I'm glad he only got a small role in the film. Moving onto Will Smith played by Will Smith. I think Will Smith did a great job at playing Will Smith as he really captured all the charm and mannerisms of Will Smith. Captain Boomerang was the only character that was somewhat likable and he actually came close to having a funny scene. During the awful bar scene they're all told they can leave if they want and Captain Boomerang just walks out, this would be funny if he actually left and never showed up in the movie again but no they messed that up too by having him appear without any explanation in the very next scene. I'm not going to talk about any of the others as they were all undeveloped and boring.This movie should be given an award for the worst cinematography since AvP 2. I honestly could not see half of what was happening because the movie was so darkly lit and dull. For a movie that's trying to be Guardians of the Galaxy you would think it would make sense to use a brighter more vibrant colour palette, but instead they chose to go with the ever popular coal and concrete colour palette...my favourite. This is what I was talking about when I said the movie didn't know what it wanted to be. It's like they were going to do a more serious movie like BvS but after BvS got bad reviews for being too dark and ""not enough like Marvel"" they said OK let's try and reshoot this movie to make it more fun and comedic so you have this really weird blend of brightly coloured logos and fonts with Borderlands styled intros for the characters with popular songs (I'll get to that in a minute) on a darkly lit grim and ugly looking film and it doesn't work at all. Then you have the comedy and it's painful just really really painful, they tried to give Harley Quinn these Hilarious and quirky one-liners that fall flat every time, they made me embarrassed for me, embarrassed for Margot Robbie and embarrassed for everyone else in the movie theatre.The story was boring, forgettable, predictable and slow. The pacing in this movie is atrocious the movie spends like the first half an hour just getting started and introducing the characters and it's done in such weird way that feels like i'm watching five different trailers followed by half of a movie.Going back to this film's soundtrack. It's just a bunch of good songs put to scenes that don't fit it at all they play seven nation army, Without me and spirit in the sky all in the space of about two minutes, it is absolutely unbearable. It feels like they were trying to be Guardians of the Galaxy but in that movie the songs actually fit the tone and had a purpose outside of making people go, Oh hey! I like that song! wow this movie has such a great soundtrack I'm going to give it a ten out of ten because they played a song I like wow they're so talented what great filmmaking! A song should be used to leave you with a certain feeling or emotion I mean I shouldn't even have to explain this! This is basic stuff! If the only feeling a scene left me with was ""why did that song sound out of place?"" or ""that sounded really bad."" then you messed up! Redo the scene! Fix it! Do something! You can't just put good music or recognisable characters in famous costumes and clever little Easter eggs in your movie and think that it will make up for the: Bad audio, bad cinematography, bad acting, bad writing, bad special effects, bad lighting, bad story and some of the most appalling editing I have ever seen you can't expect people to think like that. People aren't that dumb...Oh wait. I've gone on long enough about this piece of filth so I'm going to wrap it up. Believe me I could have gone on longer but just thinking about this film gives me a headache, I would recommend watching reviews/videos by: Ralph the movie maker, I hate everything, your movie sucks and folding ideas. They go way more in detail then I ever could with this. I'm just glad that now I can finally never think about this movie ever again. Oh and if you want to see a good suicide squad movie then I would recommend assault on Arkham."
" What a let down
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,4,"This film was hyped up so much that it was almost inevitable that it wouldn't live up to such high expectations, so I was half prepared to be let down. What I wasn't prepared for was just how shoddy and poor 'Suicide Squad' actually is. The plot is weak and its delivery is messy and at times confusing.Even the action is below what I had expected, which is unacceptable considering what can be done with CGI and special effects in 2016. How can something so hyped, so highly anticipated and with so much potential turn out as lame and underwhelming as this? The film is poor and great actors such as Will Smith are wasted on such disappointing material.I went into this film expecting to be let down, and I was. But it was a hell of a lot worse than I was expecting. 'Suicide Squad' is one of the most overly hyped and hugely disappointing movies of the last few years."
" Really this movie grossed 0ver 300 million?
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,1,"To all involved in this movie your embarrassment on a daily basis must be intolerable. What I find amazing is that this was in the top of the box office for some weeks. How is it possible so many people were able to sit through this disgusting move to the end. I would have thought in the first weeks so many would have walked out of the cinema before it ended that it would get no where near being successful at the box office. I just watched the first hour of this move for the first time. After 1 hour of pain I could watch no longer. Wow all these Hollywood stars involved. Shame on you. Really you people are overrated. You should be hounded and chased down, and forced to answer questions justifying you existence and requirement for existence on this earth. $375 million gross. $175 million to make it really? To the imagination less financial bakers of this movie. You are just the best of the best(Did this rubbish receive any awards?) Please someone ponied up $175 million to make this movie? Really? Most of all shame on you, this was the best place for you to invest $175 million? What a joke."
" Needs more action
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,4,"I saw Suicide Squad about a week ago and it had its ups and downs. I like how it takes a different turn from the cliché superhero movie. Instead of having some guy/girl that is an ordinary human by day, but at night they are a crime fighting superhero. They have the government take villains out of jail, to do the job of a superhero. It is a very interesting take on it. I also really like about the acting in the movie; it was excellent. Margot Robbie (played Harley Quinn) did a really good job playing the role; she made me really believe that she was actually insane. Then, Jared Leto (played the Joker) made a really good Joker. He wasn't the best Joker of all time, but he is a close second, in my opinion. Some of the parts of the movie i didn't like was that how it took one hour to get into the action of the movie. The whole first part of the movie was an introduction of who the people are. Which I know is important, but they could at least put some little action in the introduction at least. I wouldn't of interest that quick if they put more action in it. Then the action in the movie was over so quick. It was over in a blink of an eye. I just wish they would of made the action part longer and the introduction part shorter. The end of movie felt very rush. It was really short and the ending too predictable. I won't talk much about the ending so I won't spoil it.Lastly, they made a big deal that the Joker was going to have a big part in the movie, but he didn't. Yes he had more bigger parts then others, but he was only in the movie tops 30 minutes. I wish he was in the movie more because I loved his character so much, he was actually my favorite character in the movie."
" Wasted potential
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,2,"So, I don't even know where to start with this one.Seeing as the script took just six weeks to write, the result is clear as day. An absolute disaster story-wise. Having to establish an ensemble of completely new characters to the uninitiated, with the use of distracting edits and literally spelling out who everyone is by use of stylized captions? Really?Sigh. This film is guilty of false advertising. The marketing and promotion lured the crowd in for what essentially was a dark Avengers flick. Boy, did they miss the mark?! This film fails on almost every level. The frantic pace in which they try to establish the main characters and the plot in the first half hour is just incredible. They try to make the characters relatable by utilizing fleeting flashbacks, desperately trying to make them seem relatable. It fails. Some characters don't even get the luxury of a 'backstory' and their motivations are simply explained through expository dialogue.The plot is about as standard as you can get with these superhero films. The only difference is that they're villains/convicts that get coerced into vigilantism. They have to defeat the antagonist and save the world. The execution is carried out so poorly though. Aside from Deadshot and Harley Quinn, character development for everyone else is just thrown out the window. I mean, for god's sake, they introduce a guy to the team who gets axed a few minutes later! And don't get me started on the Joker. Good God. Everybody was anticipating Jared Leto's interpretation of the character and for what we saw of him, he did alright, for what, the TWO, MAYBE THREE SCENES HE WAS IN?! I was a bit skeptical of modelling him after a pimp, with the teeth grille and velvet jacket. But at least use him a bit more if Leto is SECOND BILLING IN THE CAST!!! The utilization of the soundtrack sounded like it was mixed by some intern who first discovered the editing software. Back to back pop songs we've heard in the trailer for the first half and a criminal misuse of them at that.Look, I can complain about this film and what it did wrong until the cows come home, and upon first viewing, I was quite sparing in my criticism, saying it was OK. Upon re-evaluation, it's a disaster. A complete insult to the crowd who were enticed by what they promised in the trailers/marketing."
" What a disgrace
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,1,"This is the worst superhero movie since catwoman (2004). I'm not going to beat around the bush with this one, this film was just flat out AWFUL!!!! Not only does this film feature the worst editing I have ever seen in a movie, low budget or otherwise, but the film is just fundamentally broken. The characters either have no depth (killer croc, boomerang, katana) or have inconsistent personalities and motivations that change whenever the plot requires them to (deadshot, Harley Quinn). They aren't even acted all that well either, with he exception of margot Robbie and viola Davis every performance in this film is just terrible. Even Will Smith who everyone bizarrely praised even though he is just playing himself and not a character. The plot couldn't make any less sense even if you tried to write something more incoherent. It makes no sense why the squad would at all be effusive in defeating any supernatural menace and characters disappear and reappear at random without any explanation. The action isn't even well filmed as the scenes are typically under lit with camera positioned awkwardly whilst the characters just mindlessly shoot things without any tension, rhyme or reason. The CGI is some of e worst CGI ever put to a movie, characters never interact in a convincing or compelling way and rap music is played randomly at inappropriate times ruining the tone the scene was going for. I could go on all day about how atrocious this ""product"" was but let me just say I agree with those people who think it dose'nt deserve he rotten tomatoes score it got (26%). I agree it deserved a lot lower."
" Expected better but quite entertaining! 6/10
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,6,"Review: After reading some bad reviews about this movie, I finally got to watch it, and I must admit, it's actually not bad. OK, it's really cheesy in some parts and the director wasted a lot of time in the beginning but the action scenes wasn't bad, and Harley Quin was excellent fun. The whole Witch aspect of the film was a bit ridiculous but I enjoyed the wit and the mixture of characters, all brought something fresh to the project. Anyway, it's based on a group of super villains, who are released from jail to take down a Witch, who wants to take over the world. They all have a bomb implanted into there necks, so they can't escape whilst going after the Witch, and they join forces with the army, head by military expert Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), who takes his orders from a government official, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), who originally put the Suicide Squad together. As it is Rick's girlfriend, June Moone (Cara Delevingne) who is possessed by the Witch, he is desperate to get his girlfriend back but they have to fight through the witches army, who were way too easy to kill in my opinion. The Suicide Squad soon bond together and become an ultimate force with good intentions but they all have there own personal issues, which Amanda uses to her advantage. With Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Slipknot (Adam Beach), Katana (Karen Fukuhara) and Diablo (Jay Hernandez) at her disposal, and Batman on speed dial, Amanda's squad also have to fight against the Joker (Jared Leto), who just wants to get his girlfriend, Harley Quinn back. I didn't really see the point of the Joker in this movie and Boomerang seemed to get in the way most of the time but I did find him quite funny because of his banter with the rest of the characters. Without Harley Quinn, this movie would have been a total flop in my eyes but it actually was quite enjoyable, even though the plot was a bit poor. Some of the CGI was impressive but the dark palette took away the attention to detail. Anyway it's a decent start to the DC Suicide Squad but it doesn't touch Christopher Nolan's Batman franchise. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Although I haven't heard a good word said about this film, the profit at the box office was pretty impressive and I'm looking forward to the sequel. Director, David Ayer, 48, comes from a military background, so it wasn't surprising that the action looked realistic and on point. His previous projects include, Harsh Times with Christian Bale, Street Kings with Keanu Reeves, the great End of Watch with Jake Gyllenhaal, Sabotage with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Fury with Brad Pitt. All of his previous projects are about policemen or the army, so his approach to this film was to make it look and feel realistic, even though it's based on superheroes with special abilities. As I didn't know anything about the DC superheroes, I can't really compare this film to the comics. I did think that Diablo was the only true superhero because of his amazing fire powers, and the way that he went toe to toe with the witches brother at the end but the rest of the squad, especially Boomerang, we're pretty average. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch but I don't think that we have seen the best of these superheroes as yet.Budget: $175million Worldwide Gross: $745.6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/fantasy movies, starring Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto, Common, Jai Courtney, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Ike Barinholtz, Adam Beach, Viola Davis, David Harbour, James McGowan, Jim Parrack, Cara Delevingne and Ben Affleck. 6/10"
" Power Rangers May Have Competition
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,3,"It is a PG-13 movie so no horrific acts are allowed, just inferred like Saturday morning cartoons. The massive bad guy army is like the Power Ranger's bad guys. There are two scenes that are wtf moments and they are seen back to back. 1. Who is shooting the video of the main satellite getting blown up? 2. Who is filming (out in the ocean) the aircraft carrier being cut in half?Both these images appear on the military monitors at the Pentagon.Why did Capt. Boomerang (after knowing his micro explosive has been deactivated) return to the gang after he left? Also they missed a perfect opportunity to have a very comical scene where we see Capt. Boomerang's ""perfect desire"" instead they failed.I am not Marvel or DC fan base biased. Over all this movie is a poor attempt at cloning Marvel's Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy. But Deadpool was rated R for good reasons and Guardians of the Galaxy used actual script writers and not a team of monkeys from the zoo. DC is going to need a miracle to survive after this failure.Many of the ""squad"" members had no skill or just plain didn't do anything. Katana has no value and didn't do anything to make a difference. Capt. Boomerang was just present. Harley was a sex symbol and nice shots of her ass, I think she was suppose to be funny too. Killer Croc was also a back seat passenger to the end.Joker was featured in all the movie media and trailers, yet the joker barely shows up in the whole movie. I watched the extended version and if you enjoy watching two ""god-like"" immortals getting defeated by bombs... yes you can apparently kill God with a bomb, then maybe you will fall in love with this movie. Power Rangers may have some real competition for their Saturday morning time slot."
" Squad Good, Nemeses Bad
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,6,"The crux of most comic book movies is meta-humans (as DC calls them) or superheroes. The quality of that movie will be largely based upon the abilities of said super beings although a good story wouldn't hurt. Now we're at a near saturation point with comic book movies which absolutely necessitates a good tale as well as some very unique skill sets from the heroes. If the skill sets are not very unique those abilities better be displayed in a new and unique way.Suicide Squad was a collection of meta-humans (though one of the members wasn't really meta she was just meh) that were tasked with helping extract a VIP from a super-villain stronghold. Of the members of this motley crew I think Deadshot (Will Smith) was the most likable. He was witty and had the most character. Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje), and Boomerang (Jai Courtney) were just there and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) was a nuisance. Her character, beyond being superfluous, was very annoying with her on- again off-again pseudo-Brooklyn accent. But this was the Suicide Squad and I watch comic book movies.The story and the climactic battle were very so-so. Whereas I did have a concerted interest in who won the battle, I wasn't very impressed with the nemesis; and that's a problem. Besides being a demigod type character the main nemesis kept gyrating as though that was the source of her power. It just looked ridiculous.Along with these mankind-hating meta-meanies I wasn't keen on the unnecessary additions of Harley Quinn and the Joker (Jared Leto). I know I'm speaking from a position of Suicide Squad source material ignorance but I'm grading the movie like a novice as most viewers will be. Harley Quinn and the Joker were almost a side story that--beyond being distracting--was irritating. Jared Leto is the third rendition of the Joker (post 1989) and his is the worst in my opinion. Jack Nicholson was somewhat humorous, Heath Ledger was a mad genius bent on anarchy and Jared Leto was just a madman with make-up on and very forgettable. I liked the Squad. They were a group of which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. I even liked their controller. Spruce up the antagonists, lose the Joker (leave him for the Batman movies) and make Harley Quinn more useful than for eye candy and the movie is a lot better."
" DC is Back in the Game Baby
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"After watching Batman V Superman i wanted to see more and more of what DC has to offer. I love the dark feeling in the DC movies so far, and i got a lot of darkness in this movie. The movie had the dark and funny feeling. The jokes were hilarious and the characters were amazing. I love Jared Leto's joker. A very good new take on the character. The gangster look he had looked very good on him. I wish we got to see more of him. I thought this movie was very good, but yet again the critics bash another DC movie. Please go out and watch this movie. Its a lot of fun and very entertaining. The characters were very fun and some were funny. Deadshots back story was very well done and emotional. by far my favorite characters are Joker and Captain Boomerang. That camio was pretty sweet too. Made me excited for Justice League"
" A good soundtrack, but not much else
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,5,"I rate this movie 5/10.I had not much hopes for this movie, and actually held out on watching it until it landed at Redbox, despite my enjoyment of DC comics characters & film. I knew only one thing for certain going into this movie, and that was that it did have a pretty good soundtrack.The beginning of the movie felt like not really a movie at all; actually, I wasn't quite sure what it felt like, but I kept watching, hoping that it would go somewhere, and again, enjoying the ""good soundtrack"" that was quickly unfolding.Once the actual ""action"" started, I watched attentively, until pausing for a 45 minute nap. I then continued, somewhat less attentive, for the remainder of the movie, somehow missing the final ""victory"", BUT HEY, the soundtrack was GOOD!To hard core DC Comic fans, there may be some production value here, but for me, it fell short of a good movie and left me short nearly the price of a gallon of gas. I would recommend only spending your money on it if you have to, and instead, wait till it comes out on demand, Netflix, etc. If you do decide to watch it, I doubt it will be one you will be starving to watch again- I know I won't be."
" Fan service galore
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,4,"When I first heard about Suicide Squad I got excited, but the more was released about the movie, the less i wanted to see it. Now I've seen it, I wish I didn't. The story was lazy and cheap, and really didn't make sense at all. Every choice made in this movie was weird. And it was weird because every choice was made to 'progress' the characters. This movie already started of lazily introducing the characters, and after that throwing in some random characters that weren't introduced yet, you know just because. The only characters I liked were, Diablo, Deadshot and Amanda Waller. They seemed to be the characters they managed to finish and give actual personality. The rest like Australia man (Captain boomerang), Unfunny sexy crazy girl (Harley Quinn), Captain America and his white Mayan goddess??? (Rick Flag and The Enchantress) where so badly written, it was cringy. I'm not even mentioning the Joker because that was one hot mess, if this doesn't ruin Jared Leto's career, I don't know what will. I really don't know why people hype over Harley Quinn, don't get me wrong. Margot Robbie is not a terrible actress, its mostly due writing her character was bad. Her one-liners were so bad, I had to pause the movie at times. Her character was pushed way to much as a quirky crazy girl without really explaining why. Yet people LOVE her, while her and Joker where the worst characters of the movie. The story was cheap and purely character driven, nothing wrong with that, but at least include all characters within the story and connect them to it. Why did Killer Croc ever come back? Why didn't they kill Amanda Waller or Rick Flagg? They could have done that with ease. Where did they get Katana from? Why did she go with them? Why does every character have a sad sob story that needed to be told? Why the hell was Harley Quinn a sexy girl dancing in a club? Why was The Joker a gangster and why did he drive a purple lambo? Why? why? why? Why was it always night? Why was it so dark and gritty, while the writing of the movie definitely did not feel dark and gritty?This movie was a prime example of 'easy money grab' They didn't even try to make this a good movie. They choose the suicide squad BECAUSE of Harley Quinn, and that meant they could use the Joker (To be fair not really though, no clue why he was in the movie). This whole movie was fan service to advance a story in the DC cinematic universe in a very lazy way. Fan service is okay, but at least do it in a good way and don't write characters out of character."
" Suicide is never the answer
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,6,"What a mess. Decent performances by Will Smith and Margot Robbie fight against this chopped up train wreck. In the end it is passable entertainment but it certainly isn't what was meant by the filmmakers. Way too many characters almost all of which are criminally underdeveloped. The so called bad guys actually never do anything worse than say the Avengers would which takes away from the entire premise. The tone is all over the place. This was clearly a different movie originally before a panicked DC Universe chopped it up trying to make it more Guardians of the Galaxy. The Joker is half in and half out and Jared Leto becomes a decent scapegoat for what went wrong, but substituting him halfway through for a 90's villain that looks like he came out of a Street Fighter film is not an improvement.The movie suffers from both attention deficit disorder as being a showcase for the crimes against show don't tell. The movie tells us Rick Flag is in love with June Moone / Enchantress a silly device much of the plot rests on and yet Cara Delevingne and Joel Kinnaman have zero chemistry in their scenes together. Harley Quinn and Batman have a more convincing relationship in this movie, Watchable in a turn your mind off kind of way. Just don't think what could or even should have been."
" A mess but not as bad as people make it out to be
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,6,"This movie is a mess. It had a troubled production. Scenes have been cut and re-cut and then re-cut again. The story structure is not great and the exposition is nauseatingly blunt. The movie just writes parts of the story on the screen and then characters occasionally just explain what's happening or who someone is.And it is insultingly dumb, in every meaning of this word. I do not even know where best to begin. The movie is about a gang of people, most of whom don't have superpowers, fighting an incredible magic evil, but the movie also establishes that superman exists, so that makes no sense. The movie shows a bunch of pillars get destroyed in a subway but in one of the following scenes the same columns are only damaged. People will constantly blurt out unnecessary exposition or explanations, as if this movie was for mentally disabled. A screen in a government control room at one point shows the destruction of satellites and remote facilities from perfect angles, as if there are cameramen at each location filming at just the right moment.However, the actors all do a good job, including the ones you wouldn't think were good actors. The strange look of the new Joker doesn't work for The Joker, just like everyone thought it wouldn't, but it does fit this specific character in this specific movie. The story, although simple and poorly put together, does make some basic sense. The movie looks cool.It is essentially a dumb super-hero movie with style. It is harmless enough to run at an evening party."
" Bad in all aspects
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,3,"One of the worst movies I've seen in the last 5 years.Ridiculous plot: a bunch of tarts vs. some god-like entities, and yet 'squad' wins. Those entities could have ended all mankind in a blink, but some hot mentally unstable girl with a baseball bat and her team somehow manages to stop them.The joker: Jared Letho, awful. Hated every scene with him. Harlequin: yet interesting character in Batman games, dull and annoying in this movie. The fire guy: immense powers but useless until the end, bad acting, could not feel any connection to it. Deathshand: If it wasn't for Will Smith, I would have quit the movie after 15 minutes. All other characters are non-important, non memorable, bad acting and have nothing to do with the entire movie. Weller: just please...hated every scene with her.2 hours wasted of my life. Thank you marketing for successfully over hyping a piece of garbage.PS: what was that guy with the boomerang all about? How did he get there?"
" Zero If I could. Worse than B V S
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,1,"This film is poorly paced, poorly written and broken. I mean I Hate Everything's video completely sums up my points. The characters have barely any development the CGI is 2012 levels of poor, you wonder why Batman and Flash didn't help out. The only two characters not making m e want to stop watching were THE MAN WHO CAN CLIMB ANYTHING and Captain Boomerang. I just, really despise this film and, no, Batman Vs. Superman is not worse that film at least have moments. So, yes, the movie sucks. Attack me for my opinion, tell me to kill myself, whatever, I don't care if you take it to those lengths, you have issues being as attached to this movie as you are. Tell me why you think i'm wrong, i'll read it and...... consider. It's my opinion, so why care. -Douglas Miller"
" Worst DCEU film yet
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,3,"I had really high hopes for this movie after seeing the trailers. I thought it would a funny, dark comedy kind of superhero movie with lots of awesome action, and a new rendition of the Joker that could live up to the standards of previous ones. Boy was I wrong...Let's start with the editing. It's godawful and makes everything in the movie hard to follow. The movie just randomly moves between scenes with no real transitions or setup. The effects are also pretty terrible. The Ancient God Whatevers look like they belong in an Asylum film. Not in a movie with a budget of 175 million dollars. And Killer Croc looks like the lovechild of Jaws and George Costanza with a bad case of greyscale.The acting in this film is okay. Margot Robbie does a good Harley Quinn, Jai Courtney isn't terrible for once and is actually funny at times, and Will Smith is Will Smith cosplaying as Deadshot. Everyone else is either forgettable or has really terrible lines. Like Rick Flagg, who is just there to give shitty exposition so the movie can just add random fan service characters without worrying about actually having to show their personality and traits.But the worst part of this film is the Joker. With any Joker incarnation, he should be able to make the audience laugh and be scared by his performance. Jared Leto's version tries way to hard to be both and fails miserably. When he tries to be funny and over the top, he just comes off as extremely cringy, and when he tries to be scary, he just seems like like an edgy tryhard. His acting as Joker isn't helped by his terrible design. I mean come on, those stupid tattoos are basically exposition on his character because Rick Flagg isn't there to explain him. The film also absolutely butchered Harley Quinn and Joker's relationship. Suicide Squad made it seem like the Joker actually loved Harley. Their relationship was always meant to be an abusive one where Harley has deluded herself into thinking the Joker loves her, when in reality, the Joker is just using her. This leads to the Joker coming off as more of a lovesick puppy instead of a manipulative criminal mastermind. And if a film can't even get its most hyped characters right, it isn't worth wasting your time watching."

" Mediocre
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,5,"Its better than Batman vs Superman but still isn't a good movie. The premise is simple however the film constantly feels as if it has to remind us that these are the bad guys and that's not good. The overall plot is a bit of a mess and the third act is awful however there is good to be taken from it. Will Smith and Margot Robbie do great in their roles, Robbie especially however surprisingly its Jai Courtney who steals the show as Captain Boomerang. Jared Leto makes an interesting Joker but is no patch on Heath Ledger and doesn't get nearly enough screen time. The action is good if a bit unmemorable and the soundtrack is alright. For a movie about bad guys though the main villain ""Enchantress"" is truly terrible. Its a shame as I feel the rumored re-shoots really hurt this film. A more darker film with more character development would of been much nicer as there was potential here for a cult classic."
" Dc comics's (1) worst movies of all time
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,1,"Suicide squad was the most God awful movie I have ever scene out of the DC Comics universe. Director and writer David Ayer who directed (Fury) in 2014 and (End of Watch) in 2012; gave the movie to much rap music and low esteemed gangster remarks that shouldn't of been in the film . The story lacked plot and story. David Ayer also chose the wrong type of cast. I am not going to go into the movie details. All I can say to future dc fans going to watch the film, it's not the type of film you thought to expect. The company and people who designed this film were crazy. I personally believe Christopher Nolensville, who directed ( the dark Knight trilogy) and ( Man of Steel) should of directed the film because he gave his films story and meaning, but also it should of had the right cast for it and characters such as, Erin Richards (Harley Quinn), BEN Affleck (Batman), Cory Michael Smith (Joker), Amanda Seyfried ( killer frost), Jessica lucas ( Amanda Waller), Tom hardy (killer croc), Jason Clarke ( captain boomerang), and finally Scott Eastwood as (Dead Shot)."
" Confusing. Boring. Spoilers, I guess...
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,2,"Just rename the film ""1 hour of Margot Robbie in Booty Shorts,"" because that was about the only thing keeping some people interested. The action certainly wasn't interesting. It was a mess. I've never read the comic books so I don't know any of the characters other than Batman and The Joker. Batman makes a couple cameos at the request of some psychopathic woman. Was her character suppose to be a good guy? She kills three FBI computer guys for absolutely no reason. The ""bad guys"" are brutalized by supposed other good guys YET the super villains do nothing menacing to any of the ""good guys"" even when they have the chance. The Joker? Why was the joker in this movie? He does nothing and contributes nothing and his character is so different from any other Joker portrayal all the way back to Cesar Romero. The only character who gets any decent portrayal and sympathy is the MS13 fire creating gangster and when he starts getting interesting they ruin it with a sudden explosion of action and 10 seconds later the scene is over. The director tries WAY to hard to recreate the Christian Bale dark portrayal of Batman but throws in so many stupid one liner jokes it just doesn't work. Nothing ties the mess together. Each character gets about 2 minutes of buildup. The super-duper Non-Human villains get about a 3 minute buildup. There is no planning of the schemes. They just suddenly create a machine to destroy the world. If you want to see a movie that has all bad terrible people but they are likable and you end up cheering for them go watch ""The Wild Bunch."" Avoid Suicide Squad. With so much mess crammed in to such little time the best description comes from Rick Flag.""12 pounds of s__t in a 10 pound bag."" -"
" Making an edgy movie isn't the same as making a GOOD movie, I mean my razor is edgy and its a cheap piece of sh*t
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,3,"Not as good as watching someone play Super Mario 3-D World, which is exactly what happened when I watched Suicide Squad. I did not watch all of the movie, but I had someone at work who had watched all of this sh*t movie twice, tell me what happens. I feel like that qualifies me as having seen Suicide Squad. Also Harley Quinn's backstory came off as a little rapey. Like David Ayer could have just written the Harley Quinn character as always subconsciously attracted to the Joker, but instead he wrote it so it reads as though the Joker has Harley gang raped into submission. Why write it that way? How is that better? Oh yeah, directing sucks acting sucks movie was written for sh*t, Suicide Squad officially reviewed."
" Two words. Atrocious and Horrible
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,1,"Complete garbage, they ruined The Joker and Harley by cramming everything in like adding in extra useless characters such as batman and others, they didn't fit it in and didn't feel like it was any kind of sub-plot as mentioned in other reviews.I did like Will Smiths performance as Dead-shot which fit in well with the plot and improved things for Enchantress vs the team but the cut/editing was just awful.The extended version should've just been released as normal but they have to charge extra for correcting their mistakes...and don't get me started on the soundtrack P.s. The endings felt lazily slapped up as well (Not a spoiler)"
" A cheap parody of the DC universe
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,1,"No plot, no wit, no depth, no dialogues. I believe this movie is pretty easy to summarize: it's simply a huge mess. This movie was enormously hyped and was not able to meet the expectations. I had really high hopes for the Joker, as Jared Leto is usually hardly a let-down. However, in this case his portrayal of the Joker was simply ridiculous and over the top. Generally, I feel like every single actor was not on the top of their game. Feels like they adopted their level of acting to the awful movie. I feel like I wasted 2 hours of my precious life on this and I regret every single minute of it. Particularly sad, as this comes from a big DC fan. Expected so much more and am clearly disappointed. Pleaso no more of this!"

",2017-01-03 00:00:00,3,"Why are DC and Marvel movies the same? Batman vs Superman = Captain America Civil War, right down to the techy hero having his parents killed by bad guys.Suicide Squad = X-Men Apocalypse. Humans turn on a god like being, entrap him (them), then turn to, in the gods' words, worshiping machines. Now the gods are back to re-conquer the world.Recruited to stop the gods are the X-Men/Task Force X, a team of mutants/meta humans. But the god also recruits some of the mutants / but one of the meta humans is one of the gods. Some of the X-Men who help defeat the god are former villains / most of the Task Force X members who defeat the gods are villains.At least the Marvel version had a lot of action.

" DC Presented The Story Wrongfully...
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"The producers and writers could have thought that this could be a very good TV Series about a group of ""bad people"" trying to find their way by communicating with each other, other than blowing up places or killing random people just for the audience... Like ""The Breakfast Club""... We'd call it ""Narrations of Suicide"". Maybe. Then, as the season develops episode after episode, the conflict would arise... Deal with it!..Let us say it first; this movie could have been better in many ways. First; it has so great a cast that had the screenwriters written a worse dialogue the cast could have a way to make it seem less horrible. Oh what? This is exactly what happened in the movie!.. DC writers did a kindergarten-kind of an introduction for nearly every one of the characters while disrespecting the ""Slipknot"". So, it was obvious that he is to be killed immediately while deemed unimportant for the narrative. This is sloppy. One could ask: ""so why have you watched the extended version, then?"" That is not important. The short version has manifest defects too. So, this is the time we move on to the second level:The writers tried only to present how ""evil / graceless"" each character is, therefore they did not have time to reveal a clever plot for the movie:The usual kind of, ""left-alone-God(s)' / Goddess(es)'-wrath-to-be- brought-upon-infidels"" revealing plot. The usual kind of ""hopeless-enough-to-shake-hands-with-evil(s)"" attitude.The usual kind of ""all happens for / against U.S. of A."" story line.The usual kind of ""nervous characters messing with each other by a threadbare jokes only to get along afterwards"" options.The usual kind of ""aberration of characters for better or worse."" 1-Remember Deadshot; he has some humanity left in him, right. And he was injected with repentance by his innocent daughter. But we don't see his ""internalization process"" during the movie. Next minute, he is talking biblical...)2- Remember Harley Quinn; she is supposed to be beyond insane as she seems unpredictable to the fullest in the first half of the movie. Later on, she suddenly becomes friendly and acts off-the-script ""for love."" One could remind us of her love for the Joker. But hey, she is the ""Holy Craziness.""I could go on with ""the usual(s)"". But I won't. No reason. Yeah. Maybe I cannot see more. Or maybe I am just tired. Sorry. (I am the worst!)So... Most importantly, they represent the Batman as an incompetent, ineffective, clueless-of-the-developments-in-his-city kind of a hero which he is not supposed to be. He is the helper of justice. Not a businessman! Yep!Let's see another good point: The idea that the ""bad guys / villains"" are inclined to being better persons during their journey is so well a thought and so good an example for the world we live in!.. We should spread good tidings not horrors!.. Thank you, D.C. for this!.. I hope you exercise it better the next time!P.S.: They picked good songs for the movie, okay. The visuals are fine. They surely depicted the D.C. universe different than the Marvel as D.C. is darker. This is better than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice as Suicide Squad has less ""aimlessness"".Margot Robbie sure plays perfectly! But they need not to objectify her to gain more viewers. Nudity often comes not ""artistic."" Stop it guys.For Will Smith... He is the actor to play your ""lonely hero"" movies. He is astonishing once again!I will give this movie a ""7,3"" as it is clearly better than ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" and its equals. Yep.Let's see what The Gracious Koran says on the matter in the 52th Verse of the 11th Chapter called Hud (who is a Prophet in Islam):""And, O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn unto Him repentant; He will cause the sky to rain abundance on you, and He will increase you in strength unto your strength; and turn not your backs as sinners."""
" How to kill a franchise 101
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,3,"This movie is bad, real bad. There is nothing good about it, just some mediocre things. Most of the movie is bad though. The beginning is like a trailer after trailer, play some hip music (even if it doesn't fit the mood at all), show a character and repeat several times.Visually the movie isn't very good either. The CG is not bad, but the whole movie is unnecessarily dark, even when the characters stand in direct sunlight or in a room that is on fire it is dark. The characters should have been the best part of the movie, it is quite the opposite. Deadshot is OK, but Will Smith is too charismatic to play a ruthless assassin. Captain Boomerang was surprisingly enjoyable, he was the only believable criminal. He had no higher motivation, he was just an asshole who cares only about himself. El Diablo was rather undeveloped. Killer Croc was forgettable. Katana felt like she was shoved in last minute, no explanation, rushed backstory that didn't really explain anything. Slipknot was there just so they could kill somebody off. The villains were relatively fine (for this movie's standard). I intentionally left Harley Quinn and Joker last. Harley Quinn was incredibly annoying, in all the wrong ways. Joker was absolutely butchered. DC's best villain ruined in about 20 minutes he had in this movie. TL;DR: Watch Batman Assault on Arkham, it is a better SS movie (IHE was right)"
" Lucky I didn't watch it in the Cinema
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,2,"It is very simple what I can describe this film and I quote ""You look like an avocado had sex with an older, more disgusting avocado"". Jared Leto's Joker and the combination of Will Smith and Margot Robbie's ASS are the only good things going for this film. Now the negatives: the overuse of music, the death of one of the squad (Who was doing all the press conference's and he died within like 10mins of appearing), no investment into the characters in that I didn't care when someone died and the plain/bland storyline that an infant could have written (If you count an infant crapping in its hands and telling how it came out). Truly terrible."

" What a waste
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,6,"The last decade has all been about Marvel. Now DC comics are coming into the limelight with a number of eagerly awaited titles in the pipeline. This movie had a number of interesting depthy characters and a story-line that kind of worked for me. Two individual performances were simply brilliant, Harley Quinn was sexy and crazy and believable and Jared Leto's performance as the Joker was an unexpected gem. But that's all the pluses for me! The special effects in this movie weren't all that special. Action scenes were cluttered and hard to follow and the whole thing just seemed a little rushed. In my opinion the producers have done one simple thing wrong that marvel worked out a long time ago. All of the characters both good and evil seem to have depth and an interesting backstory and could have likely had their own individual story told. And telling this first would have taken away the need for flash introductions and would have made the viewer understand and care for them."
