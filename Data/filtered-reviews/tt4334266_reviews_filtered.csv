" Like an Iceberg, you must see beyond the water surface
",2021-04-12 00:00:00,9,"To understand the film, the viewer must know how to look beyond the surface, to look for what bothers him, to analyze what is not understood at first.The pace, deliberately slow, reminds me some classic films by Ozu, David Lynch, Antonioni, Losey, some authors of the ""nouvelle vague"": Managing to convey the viewer to an strange feeling, with a surreal atmosphere.Good actor performances, good staging (that desert to nowhere, that musical band, those dreaming troubled drugs produced scenes), a very correct script with some inconsistencies (I think theyre voluntaries) put at the service of creating the desired effect and of the key question posed by the Director/Creator, the answer to the apparent senseless search of the protagonist: How to survive unscathed (morally, even at the cost of losing shreds of flesh) in a hostile, cruel and absurd world, as amoral as the world we live in ?.Poor little rabbit and poor child!!!"
" Interesting idea. That's all.
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,5,"The plot could develop a very nice dystopia. But I felt like the characters were lying to themselves, I mean, their performance didn't convince me."
" Not for everyone
",2021-03-18 00:00:00,7,"If you need your stories spoonfed to you with a clear plot and an ending that wraps everything up in a neat little package then this is probably not for you. A wandering, meandering visual feast set in a dystopian desert wasteland where 1000s have been tattooed and exiled; labelled 'The Bad Natch. Solid performances despite the limited dialogue, including Suki Waterhouse, Jason Momoa, Keanu Reaves, Giovanni Ribisi and an almost unrecognisable Jim Carrey. Besides the cannibalism this isnt really a horror film, and it is really more surreal. See it if that sounds like your kind of thing, you might be pleasantly surprised.."
" An oddball of a film, not by mistake but by creation.
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,9,"This film is a trip from start to finish. Critics hate the bad acting, odd script and slow, stuttering plot. That misses the point entirely.From start to finish The Bad Batch is shot with such vision that I'm left firm in the conclusion, admittedly after some initial doubt, that this oddball of a film, is not so by mistake but by creation.Lacking the semblance of a cardboard cutout blockbuster in all but the cast, The Bad Batch wouldn't be out of place as a rolling feature in an art gallery darkroom.Kudos to Ana Lily Amirpour for having minerals to throw convention out the window and make this movie. I can't believe it even got funded. Now and again you come across something wonderfully odd. This is it."
" Cool dystopian sci-fi
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,8,"I watched it with the wife and kids. We were all entertained.... good popcorn flick. Honestly I really liked this movie, very different."
" Wtaf???
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,4,"I just had to share my thoughts on this one.
This review contains spoilers from the get go.If ever the phrase style over substance applied to a film then this was it. I dug the dystopian landscape and the weirdly unique world in which the film is set, the cinematography and sceneries were beautiful and elegant, I loved the use of colours and I don't even mind the film being a slow burn with little to no dialogue.I can even get over the fact of the not so stellar performances by some amazingly talented actors but there is no way on earth you are gonna get me to believe that after someone gets brutally turned into an amputee, then has her limbs eaten by the man and his crew who ordered it.This newly made amputee then goes on to kill the leader of the fine young buff cannibals baby mama, kidnaps the daughter, after said daughter witnesses the shooting at point blank range.She then loses the daughter after taking some acid in a nearby fallout style shanty town (as ya do) then gets threatened to find the daughter that she lost (after just stumbling from the relative safety of newly found shanty town out into the open dessert on her acid trip) by big buff baby daddy or he gonna kill her crippled ass.Only to then swoon and fall in love with big, bad, buff, beard toting canibal leader baby daddy at the end of the film and want's to play happy families?????Get the duck out of here!!
Am I missing something? Did I not watch the same film as everyone else?Yes this film has its positives as mentioned above, it has numerous gaping plot holes that many others have mentioned in their reviews. Magical electricity that comes from nowhere to illuminate the acid fuelled desert rave, Pablo Escaobar I mean Keanu Reeves's magic palace with built in indoor swimming pool and fresh water with fruit and ice cubes in it. Lush lavish furnishings and fine garments in said palace whilst everyone else outside is looking like a scrub who needs a good wash. This film had more magic and sorcery in it than the entire run of Harry Potter films.But after fully reading the first fifty reviews and not a single one even hinted at the fact that its a wee bit odd that this poor women who endures all this barbarity all of a sudden develops stockholm syndrome at the end of the film shocked me more than the film itself. Hence this lengthy ass rant I mean review.If you have a mediocre flight you've got to stick the landing people.Why not shoot Jason Momoas character and then walk off into the desert scape with kiddy and rabbit in tow?Why not shoot the daughter, knee cap Jason Momoas character steal the bunny and walk off into the sunset? (The brutal ending) gasp.Why not shoot the rabbit whilst staring at momaos character as if to say. I could rinse you if I wanted but I'm better than you?Fair enough I ain't no script writer but any of these endings would have made more sense to me than u ate my arm and my leg and disfigured me for life but its okay boo I forgive you let's get coffee some time. She even asks him what he's doing now. Sigh.There are so many kool revenge films Peppermint, the film named Revenge, John Wick no 1. All these films had a satisfying payoff the bad batch did not. Bad Batch more like Bad Scratch.TLDR - Perdy looking film, kool setting, plot holes the size of meteor crates, poor acting chops, complete lack of decent script and plot and frustratingly silly ending .4 thumbs up. Boooo"
" A huge waste of time
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,1,"This has got to be one of the worse movies I've watched in the previous years. the story, plot, action, dialogue and development of characters are all not in this movie! Don't be fooled by the famous names as they have nothing to offer here. Actually, at the end of the movie, you keep asking yourself, why in the world did they even agreed to do this movie? is it the money or a favor for a friend?
In short, save your money and time."
" More concerned for the fate of the rabbit than any of the cast
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,3,"Dismal acting, horrible almost silent patches of people staring at each other, inconsistent storyline (why do cannibals suddenly turn in nice fathers etc?). Found I was looking more at the girl's rabbit and hoping it survived more than I cared about any of the cast. Jim Carey's makeup is amazing though. Didn't realise it was him until his very last scene in the movie!"
" Filmed in Crotchshot 5.1
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,3,"I couldn't help but notice the absence of any mention to the gratuitous Crotch-shots in other reviews.
The pace of the film: slow, lethargic and without a point.
The acting: either forced, fake, or very similar to a middle-school production of The Wizard of Oz.
My take is that the director sleep through every film-school class except the one about crotch-shot close-ups."
" Worst movie I have ever seen...
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,1,Read the review title again. Seriously... I can't review this movie because nothing happened. Hot garbage
" Bizarre
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,5,"A lot of stars in this independent film that drags on going nowhere and yet it's a car crash you can't stop looking at, maybe because you're trying to figure the damn thing out."
" Refreshing
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,7,In a dull common movie world is Bad Batch a very welcome and refreshing piece of art. Sometimes is less better.
" Nearly unwatchable
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,2,"The description of this film was much better than the movie itself. Imagine the original Mad Max theme set in the US and populated with A-listers throughout. Sounds great, eh? The catch is that the A-listers are only acting as a favor to someone's nephew and they can only afford to donate one afternoon to the shoot. Unfortunately for Suki Waterhouse, she gets butchered as much as her scripted dialogue in the first fifteen minutes. I'm still not real clear on the point of this film bit Jim Carrey keeps it interesting."
" Damn! Just damn...
",2020-11-26 00:00:00,1,"I'm in for ""unusual"" underground kind of movies, my favorites being dystopian future based ones, but this one, damn! Completely pointless, it basically has nothing to say whatsoever. I have no idea why and how they've managed to sign good actors for this one and why these stars accepted to be in such a flick.
A complete waste of time."
" For your own sake, I hope you can see this film for the masterpiece that it is.
",2020-11-26 00:00:00,9,"Charles Bukowski once wrote, ""Some people never go crazy. What truly horrible lives they must live."" This is how I feel about the people who didn't appreciate this film. Not the monosyllabic morons decrying the film for wasting their precious time - like ants to a picnic, those types will always heap vitriol onto any art house film worth its salt. Rather, I mean the supposed cinephiles...those who think that when this movie loses them, it's because it took a wrong turn. Sorry to say, but for all their self-importance, there are those out there, like myself, who have discovered another way of approaching cinema - maybe we're crazy, but it includes recognizing the genius of this film.It's easy to see why critics didn't like it. Unlike the director's last output, she doesn't couch her visual style in the time-honored techniques of serious cinema. I loved A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night, and in fact, the two films share a lot in common (fictional world of outsiders, injury to main character in the first act, furry critter ties everything together), but Amirpour was obviously working with a much smaller budget then and remained in the established realm of student art film. It worked masterfully, winning her awards and praise and the chance to direct a much bigger production. But rather than borrow once more from the pre-approved visual styles of Jim Jarmusch and David Lynch, Amirpour instead leans into her love of desert landscapes as she takes on the post-apocalyptic genre (Mad Max, A Boy and His Dog, Tank Girl).And yet, the tone of the film is much the same - long cuts, gorgeous stylized shots, in-camera effects. In a word, the storytelling is extremely visual, in both films. But for some reason, this style is easier to swallow when it looks like you're making the most of a small budget. It especially works well when there are no recognizable faces, as people tend to expect a certain amount of dialogue or a certain style of acting or a certain length of screen time from celebrity actors. Much like McConaughey in The Beach Bum, casting Keanu Reeves, Jason Momoa, and Jim Carrey seem to have elicited the wrong expectations from its viewers. It definitely attracted too many viewers from the mainstream (accounting for the endless dribble about the slow pacing in a large number of the reviews), and for that reason the low score is to be expected. But those viewers ought to be aware - Fury Road isn't the only way to make a film about the desert. Hell, it's not even the only way to make a Mad Max film. The Road Warrior, for instance, had a much slower pace, and it is perhaps for this reason that so many cinephiles consider it to be the best of the series. Slow pacing and desert landscapes go together like peanut butter and milk. Lawrence of Arabia, anyone? Walkabout? Of course, I'm also a huge fan of Gus Van Sant's Gerry, which I imagine had a lot of cinephilic fanboys looking for the exit.The problem boils down to this - the more cinema knowledge you have, the more difficult it can be to leave your preconceptions at the door. But as someone just as interested in finding new talent as in venerating the established veterans, I find this is a necessary precondition to enjoying the bold, original work of tomorrow's cinematic innovators. The Bad Batch is a genre movie, a western, and Amirpour knows this, employing various genre tropes, albeit in slightly new ways. She doesn't give us an obvious big bad, or a final showdown - she doesn't employ Mexican standoffs, or bounty hunters, or even gun fights. She does, however, give us a story of survivalism (both man vs. wild and man vs. man), cannibalism, kidnapping, drug addiction, forced labor, indentured service, exploitation, redemption, personal responsibility and trust, which, I don't know about you, but that sounds like a lot of juicy story content (I saw one reviewer actually list the events of the film in a similarly bulleted fashion, attempting to illustrate how empty the script was, but inadvertently listing several major themes with emotional weight and human interest). And honestly, the pacing isn't even that slow, especially when compared to films like 2001: A Space Odyssey or Solaris (outer space is, after all, a kind of desert). It's more likely that this film's detractors are reacting to the meandering plot. And it's true - the story is told in a way that makes it difficult to recall the details of the plot afterward, especially the chronology of events. It is, at times, surrealistic, even hallucinogenic. At other times the events of the film rely heavily on happenstance. Without each scene leading directly and obviously into the events of the next, it can sometimes feel like you, the viewer, are drifting through various unconnected episodes, unguided by an overarching plot. And perhaps that's true. But who said that's a bad thing? Actually, it seems like a very appropriate storytelling device, given the setting. But alas, it seems the success of Fury Road has monopolized audience expectations when it comes to films made in the desert. Don't look for that movie here. Rather, if you have any expectations at all, they should be based upon the director's debut, her revisionist approach to genre, and maybe the broader history of quirky desert films, such as A Boy and His Dog. And, for the love of God, leave behind any preconceived notions based upon the cast. They're actors, after all. They deserve a chance to show you something different."
" Skin deep: skid row meets burning man
",2020-11-26 00:00:00,3,"There was a time when the opportunity to direct a film meant breaking rules and pushing boundaries but this dystopia flick was directed like a Hallmark channel spouse abuse saga reenactment. Amirpour saved all her creativity for an LSD scene. Everything else was shot with total lack of cinematic gestures. ""Put the camera here and point it at the people talking. Ok. Action!""I keep hoping a director will emerge who has not been poisoned by the last 20 years of weak directors and generic films. Whatever quirkiness the bad batch promised was extinguished by good old fashioned patriarchy and domesticity from a Nixon_era housewife's daydream. At heart, the bad batch is basically a commercial for nuclear family nonsense and gender generic roles.This whole concept was like a skit from portlandia but they didnt have the budget so the idea was stolen and all the satire was drained from it and it is ultimately not funny or creepy or relevant or satire or anything but an odd collection of actors acting weird in a weird setting."
" Why?
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,1,"Writer, actors, director thinks that have a cult movie on their hands. Audience disagrees. Pointless, slow, uninteresting."
" Good soundtrack
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,3,"Not good but refreshing. The soundtrack is actually one of the best in recent years.
That's it."
" Couldn't even finish it.....
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,1,This is an awful movie. The first 45 minutes there isn't but maybe one full sentence spoken. It has good stars for an incredible flop of a movie. Don't waste your time.
" Worst film I have ever seen
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,1,"No more needs to be said as I rarely give a movie a 1 out of 10 which should mean it is one of the worst films you have ever seen - utter pretentious garbage with absolutely zero redeeming qualities - what was Keanu doing in this, i hear it was a favour for a friend - really?"
" Just asking myself one question
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,Wasted talent in this movie with poor writing and weak story line. Only asking myself one question . How in the world do you get Jim Carrey and Keanu Reeves in the same movie in 2016 with a $6 Mil budget?
" Awful
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,1,"It may be because of the high hopes instilled with such a star studded cast, but this film was very much a waste of 2 hours of my life. It lacks a functioning plot, the setting is plain and redundant, and the dialogue is almost non existant. The opening scene is the best of the film but after that 15 minutes, it is an hour and 45 minutes of a slow moving depressing let down. Do not watch. 1/10"
" I was rendered speechless
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,2,"This film was Jason Momoa and Keanu Reeves in it... It's from the director of A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, a real surprise hit of a vampire movie. It's set in the dystopian Mad Max future where a crippled woman has to face a desert full of monsters and rapists with her guts and prosthetic limb alone.This should have been amazing.But the execution is the key in everything that is ever done. And that fails on all the levels here. This film has no idea what it should be doing. It has no direction. No rhyme, no rhythm. It's not tasteless enough to be a gore film, nor is it coherent enough to be proper dystopian science fiction. Its actors seem to have had next to no direction whatsoever as they're mainly just reading out their lines with no inflection whatsoever.And it's just so amazingly disjointed. The story wanders from one scene to another and nothing about it makes any sense. It's like someone smashed two completely different stories together and then tried to parse together a narrative from the ashy remains of their cliff notes.The worst crime this film is guilty of, however, is the fact that it criminally misuses its Momoa and Reeves. The two should have been the highlight of the film, but instead they're just about the most baffling and boring part of it. Which boggles the mind. How is that even possible!?Hard skip on this one."
" Soundtrack is quality
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,6,"Strange n weird but I liked it,it could have been much better,"
" Good but... ugh
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,8,"So, I did really like this film. I thought it took some initiative, it was pretty raw whilst being very low key at times as well. It was deep whilst being shallow at the same time and I adored some of the acting in this.However, I just can't sit and give it the five out of five I feel that the film deserves due to casting Suki Waterhouse as Arlen. This would have been an amazing film, opportunity and time to have casted a disabled actress (and there are many with the same amputations that Arlen has) for this role. It would have been absolutely perfect with that but I just can't sit and pretend like it didn't bug me through the whole movie.The horror genre needs to open up and this would have been the perfect film to kick start some of that."
" Unwatchable
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,1,"The actors might have been paid per word spoken bc the movie has hardly any dialogue. It's all over the shop, someone forgot how stories have a start middle and an end.Boring. I'm sorry but I couldn't even watch it to the end AND I'm stuck in isolation. In fact I watched a movie about snakes yesterday that had shocking reviews but I enjoyed that, now if you gave venomous a 1, this movie had to be -100."
" Visually stunning but around 30 minutes too long.
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,7,"The visually most interesting film I've seen in years, lovely use of wide shots & desolate landscape shots.
Visually it's a masterpiece but severely lacking in the plot department.The first 20 minutes are by far the strongest, the rest of the film has strong moments but sadly the plot is sparse and the message mixed.It's trying to make allegories & metaphors but sadly they don't land very well.Would recommend for visuals & music alone, with interesting performances. Jim Carrey as the hermit really stood out to me.Overall beautiful but slow."
" Dreadful lead actress
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,5,"Great idea, beautifully shot, decent script, overall good performances by cast...
But it must have been apparent very early on that Lead actress Suki Waterhouse was putting in a dreadful turn.
I've not seen her in other stuff but purely on the basis of this performance... NOT AN ACTOR.
Every look she gives is wrong
Sadly Hollywood needs to learn not not every wealthy English girl can act."
" It's slow and it doesn't make any sense
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,3,"This movie started quite interesting and in your face. But not before you first had to sit through minutes of nothing. And this is the problem throughout the whole movie: it's so slow! It's like the director never heard of pacing before. I think that if this was made into a shortfilm it would be much better (if they would also rewrite the story, changed the setting and characters and just went with a simple revenge story with cannibals). But now it seems like everything is so stretched out, but it's so unnecessary.On top of that, almost nothing the main character does makes sense. Especially in the end. In short: she ""adopted"" the kid of a woman she killed (who was a cannibal). The dad of the kid wants kid back. Unbeknowst by him he ""hires"" the girl who killed his wife to find the girl. The kid meanwhile lives a live of luxury after being found by the ""big chief"" of the town called Comfort. Then the main character finds out where the kid is, goes there, and even gets the chance to live in luxury as well. But no, she kidnaps the kid and brings her back to her cannibal dad in the desert. She didn't save the kid, she ruined the kid's life by dragging her out of a life of luxury to live in the desert with her dad (who even almost immediateley kills the pet rabbit of the kid BTW).So it's very slow, very stupid and very pointless. I can't really recommend this to anyone. I'm also wondering what genre this movie's supposed to have. There's not enough action to be a action movie, it's not sad enough to be a drama, it's definetely not a comedy, not a horror movie, it's not really science fiction either. What is it? (besides a waste of time)
It has no identity."
" Netflix has no fast forward
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,1,"This movie just makes no sense. Bad acting, no plot. But I realized watching it that Netflix only has a 30sec back key, not a 2h skip forward one. Such a shame in this case...
I feel robbed of two hours of life."
" Different, but in a good way
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,8,"This movie was a pleasant surprise for me, but I do understand why others are leaving some bad reviews. The movie doesn't shy away from showing you the slower parts of what life would be like in the world they created. I found the slower parts personaly helped bring me into that world though. It was interesting to think about what I would do in each situation presented, and you really felt the hopelessness of the main characters situation at times, as well as her strength as she continued on. The best way I can describe the plot is that they simply took an uncut portion of a person's life and turned it into a movie. This means that the plot doesn't exactly have a clear direction or a traditional layout with a buildup, climax and ending per say. If you like thought provoking dystopian movies and enjoy just seeing what a broken world would be like, I'd recommend this movie to you. If you like the more traditional approach of movie story telling, than I'd probably pass on this one."
" not as bad or good as they say...
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,6,"I've seen 1 and 2 star reviews, and I've seen 8 or 9 stars. This movie lies somewhere in the middle. There is a ton of talent in this movie, and the story was interesting enough, but there is a ton of wasted potential here. I hope to see this directors next effort as I'm sure the craft will be refined. Overall, it can be a tuff watch, but the performances are outstanding. If you want something original check this out."
" great movie
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,8,"Loved it. great film about forgiveness, redemption and change. great ending and amazing soundtrack. acting was solid too."
" This is a modern day ""La Strada"" though not as tragic.
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,8,I watched it twice in one day.****Spoiler Alert****Zampano and Julietta with hope.
" Very well written
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,8,Very bleak! But well written and thought provoking movie. If you can get past the cannibals and drugs
" Definitly something different
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,5,"Some strange movie, but at the same time a masterpiece. The camera work is well done, but sometimes the colorgrading at it self is very bright.And the story, I think some love them, and some hate it. It's something new, out of the mainstream. After watching the film, you can ask yourself alot about the main persons.
Who is the character? Which position did he have? Is there a personification? You can also interprate some characters.All in all you should watch the movie. Maybe you love, maybe you hate it. But it's definitly something different. (Maybe a bit like Mad Max Style)"
" Don't waste your time
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,1,"I cannot think of a single redeeming feature of this film. It's a rambling, meandering mess.You could watch any other movie ever made and it would be a better use of your time. You could actually do anything else and it would still be a more fun activity than spending 2 hours watching this.Awful."
" The girl's cut arm keeps changing
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,2,"They cut the left arm and left leg of the girl and then showed her right arm as the cut one. How can you make a mistake like that? Didn't the actress realize that?
And the music choices were terrible. What's with the disney like boring songs? You could have at least gone for a Spanish song or something. I guess the producers spent so much of their budget on the cast that you had nothing left to give for your staff."
" Unpopular opinion: it's good ^^
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed watching this movie.
It's not as fast paced as most movies are these days, but I never felt bored while watching.
Also I guess that some people thought that the storyline just wasn't really there but I think the Regisseur knew what she wanted:
It feels like the Main Charakter is drifting, not really knowing where to go and that's exactly how we as the viewers should feel. We can not see how everything will turn out and the Charakter we are following can't as well.
So I think the unusual pace and unnormal storytelling adds to the movies feel in a good way and puts us in the shoes of the maincharakter.
The movie doesn't do any explaining and we don't understand everything that's going on. Because of this it feels like we are guests to a small part of the Charakters life's, leaving when the film ends. And since their lifes aren't finished yet the story might not feel finished for the viewers as well.In conclusion: I really liked the feel of the movie and the Charakters.
But it really isn't a usual movie, with typical Charakters or a storypace we are used to, so if you are looking for that you won't like it."
" We don't need this stuff in the world
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,1,"Some friends would call this 'sega mentale' -
What a waste of resources"
" Who wants to stay with a guy that ate your leg?
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,3,"It's a very pretty movie in places, the night scene on lsd was pretty cool. I can't root for a protagonist that constantly makes the wrong decision. Maybe It's cuz I'm a guy and don't find Jason Mamoa attractive and definitely not after him and his daughter ate her body parts. Sorry but I choose a/c, pot and real food over a guys that gonna take you other leg next time you pass out.In some form or another I should root for someone and here the only sensible person is the drug dealer by the end..."
" Absolute garbage.
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,1,"How did they get a cast with Keanu Reeves, Giovanni Ribisi, Jim Carrey, and Jason Momoa in this POS? No real plot or storyline. Mad Max without cars. Was the director someone in the buisnesses kid wanting to break in? This was awful, don't waste your time. The worst movie I've ever seen."
" Oddly captivating for the more mature movie lover
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,7,"This isn't perfect by a long shot but it is an unusually captivating film. It's the combination of great music, great sound environment, nice cinematography, an attractive lead, oddball characters and violence.
I don't see any resemblance to Mad Max except the landscape. If not for the many unanswered aspects, it would have rated higher.
If you enjoy the depraved first 20 mins, don't expect the rest of the film to follow suit. If you're after action or fast moving story, look elsewhere.
What annoyed me was the unexplained. How is the town of Comfort getting electricity, how are they earning their keep, why drug the community, where do all the weapons come from, what did the lead do to land herself in this prison, why would Momoa kill and cut up a whole body just for the 3 of them -do they have refrigeration? Why didn't Arlen take the golf buggy after the kill instead of walking, where do they get fuel from, why does the kid seem mute until the final scene, and what's with her grimaced face 90% of the time.Yeah -this movie leaves lots of scripting and plot to be desired yet the aforementioned excellence kept me intrigued."
" I don't think people get this
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,9,"It's like poor reviews are upset that this is too much like a classic to be one but it stayed with me and it is a classic IMO - I have been watching movies critically since the 70's when it was our only outlet I would put this movie up there with any ones like it. It's not appreciated enough I think it's ahead of its time.
Update - The other thing is that I watched this movie over a year ago and still parts of it come to mind , it really is something ."
" Something different for once
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,9,"Look all the bad reviews for this is from people expecting something they never just go with the flow. They don't like change and they always need answers, always expecting the same drivel that gets churned out 1000 times a yr.
Yes it's weird yes its random yes its confusing to the point where you're thinking is this rubbish or right up my street? And the answer is a big fat yes!"
" Slow. Very slow
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,2,The first 10 minutes is as good as this film gets. It's as slow as hell. Wasted A list actors. I wouldn't waste 2 hours of your life.
" Just dont.
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,1,First time giving a movie a review just because it's so horrible. Dont waste your time
" Like concentrated Marmite
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,5,"This film has split the reviewers. Mostly, they either love it or hate it. Just like Marmite. Me? I think it is the weirdest film I will see this year - at least I hope so. Should you watch it? If you are easily offended, or if you like neat, obvious plots then probably not. My other recommendation? Get your mind into a chemically-altered state before you less ""play"".What was the writer/director thinking? Don't ask me, I have no idea, and I did watch the film."
" Contrived indulgent garbage
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,1,"This film started off okay but soon fell of a cliff edge into a meandering, coma inducing piece of narcissism.While it tries to edgy and original it is cliched and dull - by the hour mark I was struggling to follow the story, and struggling even more to stay awake.The script is hollow and ponderous, the acting wooden but it's the directing which lets this film down. Everything about this film shows a self-obsessed and talentless director, trying to make their mark but falling from it."
" Burning man for spiritual simpelton girls
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,1,"If you are a new-age party-girl who likes drugs, trance-festivals and buff macho guys, then this is for you. Litterally the WORST movie i have ever seen.The stupidity is perfectly summarized in the end, where the young spiritual techno chick says to the buff man ""what if what happend to us, happend, so this could happen to us?""......i cant even......."
" WTH
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,1,This is sadly the biggest waste of money on film production I have ever seen. With a cast that could of generated recorded breaking numbers if it was a different movie.
" Original concept
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,7,"From time to time I like to watch movies that are weird, different and does not follow Hollywood standards. This movie concept is quite interesting, even the message is not fully delivered because of the weak script, the movie itself is great.
First, the movie looks like a mixture of Mad Max, The Hills have Eyes and The Burning Man music festival, and adding Jason Momoa and Keanu Reeves, sounds good right?
Second, even the script has some plot holes like the origin of the cannibals or the people living the dream, the main idea is interesting and pretty well executed. Similar to Ying Yang theory.
Third, the use of FX's here are pretty effective. They look like pretty realistic.
To sum up, the movie it is quite interesting and has an original concept and even the weak script, it is pretty well executed. So, overall underrated."
" Terribly underrated!
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,7,"This is my first, and possibly only, review on IMDB. Felt I needed to come out in defense of this film which I regrettably put off watching for so long. There was initially two things that put me off after I'd seen A Girl Walks Home and wanted more Ana Lily Amirpour: cannibals and Jason Momoa's eyebrows (seriously, those things are straight out of a comic book). Anyway if you can get past a little gore and the f'd up concept of cannibalism this film is a worthy, bigger budget follow up to AGWHAAN. Suki Waterhouse creates an icon with the role, Keanu's character will come at you like a curveball, and everyone else is diggable yet understated.I love Amirpour's pacing and the breath she allows into films. To sum up, you get some dystopian sci-fi, a little horror, and a really good movie about compassion and heart. Watch this film, and keep The Dream alive!"
" So rubbish
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,1,"This was just terrible, only watched about 25 minutes, why eat people when there are rabbits, dont waste your time as it's just another one pants films on Netflix"
" Don't waste your time
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,1,"Kept waiting for it to get good, right up to the ending credits. One of those films that could've turned out great at any point, but nothing ever materialized. Plot was as empty as the setting."
" His naMe is Vince and this is just an opinion!
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,9,"I watched this movie a year ago and then I watched it a week ago and I liked it more the 2nd timE. If you're saying this movie was bad because of very little dialogue then you're probably a person who runs your mouth too much and maybe you should take a note and shut up sometime. If you're saying it's bad for any other reason then I can respect that. In my opinion the movie is really good, I appreciate the movie's approach for less dialogue and more of a visual performance. Maybe what we should take from this film besides the cannibalism and violence but a picture of our society today. All we do today is talk, talk, talk, everyday people are just running their mouths. Maybe we should try more listening and less talking. This movie was good, I enjoyed the direction, the acting was good, and it kept me entertained. I appreciate the effort!"
" Could have been awesome - but nope.
",2020-03-13 00:00:00,2,"I would have loved to have loved the Bad Batch, but sadly there was not much to love.The premise of a dystopian desert wasteland where funky, strange characters and even cannibals reside - including Jim Carrey, Jason Momoa and Keanu Reeves - almost sounds too good to be true right? Well you know what they say about things that sound too good to be true.Sad to say, The Bad Batch was bland and drawn out, with not much feasting for the eyes, the ears or the mind. It started out promising, but quickly went downhill.
The plot is honestly nonexistant, as is the dialogue,...and action? No action.I have to give props to whomever designed and put together that huge boombox with neon-lights though, but that's pretty much it.This could have been such an awesome movie. Meh."
" So painful
",2020-03-04 00:00:00,1,It started with to long drawn out start that immediately made me think this is going to be bad. It picked up for a few minutes and steady went down from there.So why did I watch it all? To see if it would knock 'The Room' off it's throne as the worst movie made and it may have just done that.
" What?
",2020-03-04 00:00:00,1,"Well, I watched it. I kept thinking it would get better... But it didn't. It just kept getting worse. What a total waste of time! I am glad I watched it though, now I never have to watch it again :) Absolute garbage."
" What the heck was that?
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,1,"It's truly amazing that Jim Carrey, Keanu Reeves, and Aquaman were a part of something this rotten. I turned it off around the hour mark and I'm surprised i stuck with it that long."
" Just violent
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,3,Was not impressed with this one. Just violence and its meaningless.
" Might have worked... at fifteen minutes
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,1,"Interminably dull and glacially slow, this attempt at a dystopian future film fails in every aspect. The set up isn't given enough background and the story... well, this is lust lame and slow. It also has a lot of unanswered questions that don't help the film. While it's filmed beautifully, that doesn't make up for the insanely slow pacing and sub written characterizations. Feels like a student film that got a D from a professor who feels the director picked the wrong profession."
" The Bad Batch truly lives up to its name.
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,1,"The Bad Batch truly lives up to its name. Bad, bad and some more bad."
" Should of put zero stars - the worst, twisted and really sick attempt...
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,1,"This is unbelievable sick garbage! if you hate to have a good sleep at night - have to check it out but trust me - you'll regret you wasted your time and will have a nightmares for a week or more.this is way sicker than you can possibly imagine. I'm confident that I DO NOT want to see any actors from that movie ever again. I guess Kenue Reaves was really low on his bank account balance to agree to be a part of it. Disappointed in him...Watched by accident and really REGRET it, trying to forget it for a second week and those dirty, terrible images still occasionally pop up... What kind of idiot wrote this garbage?!!! Not saying the others decided to pay for it..."
" A wonderful holiday movie for all families
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,1,"My family watched this movie over the Christmas holidays. It's a heart-warming story of a little girl named Honey who is cared for by a young handicapped woman, Arlen, after the death of Honey's mother. Honey is later taken away from Arlen and unlawfully adopted into a wealthy foster family, because the family assumes they can provide Honey a better life in Comfort than Arlen can. After much turmoil and struggle, Arlen manages to get custody of Honey back again, rescuing her from the domineering foster family. But shortly thereafter Honey's father suddenly shows up again, and we assume this means Honey will once again be taken from Arlen. But the best part of this touching movie is its happy ending. The handicapped Arlen and Honey's father form an unexpected strong loving relationship. And after all the hardship and emotional stress, Honey finally has a happy family and lives in Comfort with her father and Arlen.Suki Waterhouse puts in a superb performance as Arlen. But what is truly amazing is how real her amputee handicap and prosthetic are made to look, through special effects. Jason Mamoa does a good job playing Honey's father. He is depicted in this film as a man with a slight speech defect and eating disorder. Keanu Reeves plays the head of Honey's temporary foster home. He plays a dreamy, wealthy, but strange ladies man who is obsessed with the plumbing in his large luxurious estate.I think this movie will become my family's new favorite Christmas movie, replacing 'It's a Wonderful Life'. I recommend it as a traditional holiday movie for all families. -NOT.Kidding aside, the following is my real review:On a talent scale of 0 to 10, I'd put Ana Lily Amirpour at about minus 5. Daring to call herself a writer or a director and call this a movie is an insult as much as a joke. Anyone involved in writing, directing, or producing this pathetic puke, and daring to call it a movie should be prosecuted for fraud. Ed Woods could rise from his grave and sue these people for slandering his profession.This is not a movie. Ana Lily Amirpour is not a movie director or a screenwriter. The actors in this rot have wiped out any and all credits that they may have previously accumulated. They've reset their resumes back to a blank sheet and their slates back to zero.It's not that I have something against dystopian films. I always say that a great movie can be made of any subject if made by talented artists and professional filmakers. But you need talent and professionals.Literally and truly, I would hire any of the dozen 5 and 6-year-olds on my block to write a screenplay or direct a movie before I'd pay Ana Lily Amirpour a dime. At least the kids would provide some degree of intelligence."
" HOW DID THEY GET THIS CAST?
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,5,I don't get how they got all these super famous people to do this movie. It was pretty bad I kept waiting for it to get good but no just no
" How did they screw this up?
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,3,"How do you take a movie with this much potential and screw it up? It's like a 14 year old wrote it and thought it was super cool.Suki Waterhouse should stick to never speaking in movies. She is atrocious in this, and every line out of her mouth is like nails on a chalkboard.Sad, because it could have been a great movie, but it honestly feels like the director had her head so far up her own ass she wouldn't listen to anyone else's input. Really does come off like a 14 year old made this."
" The Bad Batch is almost like a spin-off to Mad Max
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,10,"I'm glad that I didn't wanted to read or watch any of the movie critics as well as some of the audience reviews for ""The Bad Batch"" because I wanted to make my own impression about the movie and not to get influenced by someone else opinion about the movie or to start watching the movie by having low expectations because of the mixed reviews for the film.
I honestly liked the movie and I think that ""Bad Batch"" almost maked me feel like I'm watching to a spin-off for ""Mad Max"" or that the movie takes place in the same apocalyptic future as the one from ""Mad Max"" but in a slow way and without too much crazy things like the ones from ""Mad Max"".
The cast and the soundtrack are the things that make this movie powerfull and great.As for the story,I guess you can say that it's not really the greatest story you have ever seen in a movie about a dark future for the mankind but it sure is a great plot.
I knew I would enjoy this movie right from the beginning of that scene where Arlen is caught by two cannibals who than left her without an leg and an arm and at same time one guy is listening to the song ""All That She Wants"" while watching at Arlen how she is cut by a cannibal woman.
Another great scene is with Jason Momoa who is listening to ""Karma Chameleon"" and at the same time kills a woman and then he cook her and eats her alongside his girlfriend/wife and with them it's a little girl who might be his daughter.
Overall,Bad Batch is a great movie full with an amazing cast,great soundtrack and it fits perfect as a spin-off for Mad Max."
" One lime
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,6,"Am I our must be commended for her dedication to film, though I would have prefered more depth to the story telling."
" Boring!!
",2019-12-15 00:00:00,3,"I couldn't keep awake watching this. Pretty boring, bad acting. If you has nothing to do, don't watch this movie you'll end up even more bored."
" Trash
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,2,"This is my first  review, literally joined to rate this movie. The premise had potential, but fell more than short, I mean, seriously short. I am currently watching the movie as I write this. I get the ""lack of dialogue, visual movies,"" but this is painful. Don't know what I expected from something done by Vice Media, but they need to stop letting the creative department of Vice indulge in too many drugs, while developing this pretentious circle jerk of a post-apocalyptic dystopian film. God, I need a drink."
" if you don't like this movie, you'll love Avengers 17
",2019-11-30 00:00:00,10,"Really blows me away to see the total lack of appreciation for an original film that makes you think with your head as well as your heart. People nowadays have the same attention span as a gold fish with amnesia. This film is not just visually appealing, it's methodical, thought provoking, compassionate, and chaos coupled with conundrum. It's just not gift wrapped with explosions, action, & played out storyboards. This is not your average American ""combo"" of cinema. For that reason and that reason only is why it's own rating is suffering. People haven't just missed the mark here, they're completely blind to the target--themselves. If you can't formulate a single reason why this movie is a stand out gem, not only are you unable to think outside the box. You live in it."
" This is like watching the video in the ring- the one that kills you in 7 days. I wanted to claw my eyes out.
",2019-11-25 00:00:00,1,"This may possibly be the worst movie I have ever seen, and that is saying a lot. I watch bad movies all the time. There are no likeable characters, no plot, no humor, just nothing. I always like to give directors the benefit of the doubt and acknowledge that they took so much time to create art. However, this is simply a stain on my Netflix watch list."
" Do eat me, as long as you love me
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,3,"This is not a horrible movie but a horribly boring movie with a script that makes no sense whatsoever. It starts off really interesting and I was expecting a rather decent or at least surprising movie after the gruesome start which really catches your attention.Then it just goes steeply downhill from there and especially with the incredibly slow storytelling. Each scene lasts a lifetime without any dialog or anything being communicated in body language or anything. Nothing happens.In fact, I watched this on Netflix, and after a while just started clicking +10sec time after another (som maybe I am not entitled to review) and realized I didn't miss out on anything.There are so many questions raised like: Where do they get electricity? Where do they get water? How can they make noodles!?! Do the cannibals survive on just human flesh (and stay suffer super buffed at that)?The major question though is: How the hell do they expect us to believe that the main character actually fell in love with ""Miami Man"" (i.e. the man that ate her arm and leg)? I thought she acted as such in order to get close and kill him...but then just...end credits! What the...?! Whyyyyyyyy? Because of...muscles? Will there be a sequel where we realize she does this to kill him in his sleep and invite everyone for a Cannibal Thanksgiving feasting on him?The photo is pretty decent and it has its moments, as mentioned especially the first part. This does make matters worse though as I couldn't disregard it as the utter load of extremely boring  it turned out to be, and kept watching hoping it would improve."
" Good post-apocalyptic movie with a killer soundtrack.
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,8,I liked it. It's a good post-apocalyptic movie with a killer soundtrack. And quite a bit of Fallout and Mad Max Easter eggs to boot.
" Nope!
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,1,I have no idea why this movie won awards. Its crap. No storyline and just plain boring. What the hell was the point of it? I'm a bit disappointed in Keanu Reeves for accepting his role in it -_-
" Yet another director who abuses their position to create a sexual fantasy
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,1,"I've been criticizing male directors for the exact same thing and here we have a female one who clearly cherry-picked the hottest guys who'd agree to play out her pathetic sexual fantasies.But it's funny, male directors would either voluntarily or be forced to cast ugly or fat actresses but when you have a female director all she casts is ripped huge guys that are considered hot, like Jason Momoa.We can't sit here and pretend this is an actual movie, it's just softcore porn that the director finally got out of her head and on video. Pathetic."
" 45 mins of waiting for something to happen
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,2,I couldn't take more than 45 minutes out of my life to watch this snooze fest. I had to turn it off. I'd rather watch paint dry. The 2 stars are for Jason Momoa.
" Very well done
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,9,Im kind of amazed at all the bad reviews on here . Im guessing they didn't get the point of the movie . this movie is fantasticly acted . yes there is hardly any script but you don't need it the actors convey a hopelessness and a wild feral edge by them selves . the music works perfect for every scene . its a wasteland of people who were not wanted doing what they can to live . what more do you want . I hope this becomes a cult movie because it deserves it . loved it
" Art house movie
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,7,I watched the movie by chance. I have not got any expectations. Generally for me cinema is an art. This movie was of that kind.
" What , won't watch it again, just different, good , bad , bad good
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,4,"Make your own mind up , like the characters, sort of liked the storyline, feel a little messed up about this , different definitely I can't condemn the movie to the dungeons, but can't bring into the light either"
" Still waiting for the plot to thicken...
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,3,"...that is all. Well, tried to post it but got a message ""the review is too short."""
" Continuity
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,7,"Arlen's leg is amputated above the knee. Scenes with the prosthetic leg on, show her knee cap through the front opening. Scene in The Dream's compound shows her sitting on a chair, with no prosthetic, with her knee intact."
" Do yourself a favor
",2019-09-11 00:00:00,1,"The world is full of things that can take a precious time from us. There a caos of information around. So, I give you a advice: stay away form htis movie. I finish this thinking the actors who take part of this were making a joke. A fun joke with their free time. Maybe this was a internal joke, a group of friends reunites and say: Let's make a feature film for the minimal budget ever and see what happens. The problem is the cruelty implicit here: there are people faithful believing this is a real movie. And it is not. Selfish prankers."
" Simply Genious
",2019-09-11 00:00:00,8,"There is what is and life is but a dream. I really enjoyed this pearl of life's philosophy!
Where do you wanna be out of your comfort zone?"
" Look's great, but , nothing to call home about.
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,4,"This is shoot wonderfully. The cinematography is beautiful and the settings interesting like an early in Mad Max flick. But leaves you with some questions like, why is the world like this? Are these people living in a desert Wasteland for a reason? Etc."
" Not to bad at all. I'll remember this one when I wake up tomorrow
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,7,Was not planning to watch the whole movie but after a few WTF?! and a few grin moments early on I was sold.I'm happy there are still movies like this out there and people that are still making them. I also like marvel movies but really need these too!Just a fun dreamy non realistic look on an alternate future and a story unfolding in it.If you're a sucker for post post apocalyptic movies like me you might like this one.
" Faith no more
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,9,"Once again, i rewatching one of my favourite, and a most underrated movie ever. Forget all you knew about post-apocalypse stories, the truth, is much more uglier and closer to each of us, than you could ever imagine. Simply realise, that you are just a random good looking monster, trying to survive in a world, where's no more good or bad existed. Neither white, nor black. There's no moral anymore. Just you, and a bunch of strangers which wants to eat your life. Literally or in some other way. There's some famous names among this mess - Jason Momoa, Jim Carrey and Keanu Reeves, but they are just act the same as you will do, poor creature. Realize it."
" An eccentric masterpiece
",2019-08-28 00:00:00,10,Liked this movie because it demonstrates an interesting visual shape and expresses some useful ideas. The desert looks amazing and all actors are selected precisely. Plot is not complicated but is not too plain to be boring - it is just as simple as I would desire.
" Don't, again, do not watch
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,1,"Dont need to write the history down, this film doesnt deserves this!I'm pretty sure that the reviews above 6 are from the same person, coz its IMPOSSIBLE to exist two or more people who likes this!This probably is the worst film ever!So, don't, just don't watch this film"
" Um... so, about that..
",2019-08-08 00:00:00,8,"Idk what just happened. It was weird, disturbing, satisfying? Just really REALLY weird.
But I liked it in this really weird way.
Anyone else get Fear and Loathing vibes?The whole movie in one sentence: girl gets thrown into desert, arm and leg chopped off by cannibals then ends up in a village where she leaves, kills little girls mom, takes little girl, goes back to village, loses little girl, meets little girls dad, finds little girl, lives happily ever after in desert with little girl and dad.Okay, that was a semi long sentence. This movie has no rhyme or reason. Just a super weird movie."
" WTF
",2019-08-08 00:00:00,1,"I thought to myself, ""how can a movie with Keanu Reeves and Jason Mamoa go wrong....?"" Then I watched ""The Bad Batch"". Nothing/no-one to blame but myself 🤢"
" Nope
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,2,"Artsy, pretentious filmmaking, slow as hell. Everything you expect to see show up at a film festival but stick around because it's very high quality. Quite boring."
" What in the tarnation?
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,4,"I'm still not sure what I just watched... Visually, this was absolutely stunning and an amazing view of the dystopian future for the ""bad batch"". It was gruesome, disturbing and yet kept my interest. Unfortunately, there were too many plot holes to save this from eating itself."
" my notes
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,1,"Pointless waste of time. one of the slowest and most boring movies i've ever seen. i watched most of it at a whopping 2.5x speed. normally at 2x speed it is difficult to understand some of the dialogue. this movie had almost none, and on top of that the scenes were extensively long with nothing happening, so i had no problems watching it at 2.5x speed. that's how much nothingness this movie is filled with (1 viewing)"
" Had a big potential, but...
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,3,"...even though the setting in the movie is quite interesting, the plot and ending are... wait, was there a plot or ending at all?"
" Human Protein ?
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,1,"If the movie had depicted reality, Jason Mamoa would have been skinny like Jim Carey. Under those conditions - there is No Way those dudes would be jacked - even if they were eating humans.Remember on ESPN, when the commentators would say: Come On Man !This movie was a Cluster Fvck.
Was eating the rabbit at the End the final exclamation point that Life is Brutal?I don't even know what this movie was trying to say.
They could have substituted all the A List actors with D List actors and they would have achieved the same result.This movie was reprehensible, repugnant, ridiculous, heinous, hideous, insidious, disgusting and despicable. (All better synonyms than ""Bad."")"
" Not Bad
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,8,"Jason Mamoa,Keanu Reeves and Jim Carey all in one movie is my dream come true . The movie had moments that were slow but was not bad at all."
" Why?
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,1,"Great cast, Awful movie. I would say the actors did it for the money but they didn't need it. I love Jim Carrey but apparently nobody even noticed his character. A complete waste of the actors and viewers time period."
" RUN. Do not even start this dumpster fire
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,1,"This movie's entire script cannot be more than 20 pages. Between the dead silence or what some people seem to think of as edgy music lies an absolute abomination that should have never been made.I think all the big names stars of this film were blackmailed into staring in it. I mean someone somewhere was calling in major markers to get these names and they have been tarnished for submitting. Even the superstud (Mamoa) was painful to watch as he was tasked with delivering his 20 lines through a thick Cuban accent. Spoiler, it was unintelligible and required subtitles.Jim Carey had zero speaking parts which was still far too many imho. Keanu was the crossroads of dad bod and some old 80's era cartel member which as you might imagine isn't a great look. And Gianni, just no.The movie felt like a terrible drug trip from start to finish with literally ZERO positive takeaways. You have been warned, I suffered through this hell to save you from making the same mistake. Seriously just don't even start it."
" Do yourself a favor and skip this movie
",2019-06-19 00:00:00,1,Words cannot describe how bad this movie is. I have no idea how this got made in the first place. I can only assume that the director had blackmail material on the actors.
" waste of time
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,1,It angers me that somebody thought this was a good idea. Should have given the money to make this to charity.
" The Bad Decision
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,8,"This is going to be one of my very few short and sweet reviews. As I'm a journalist I like to pick things apart Stan Ruth you down the way I do the music that bands send me. However, it's late at night and this movie could take hours upon hours to pick apart. First off, this is a star-studded cast, and if you aren't careful and really scrutinize people you might miss who's right in front of your face! I know I didn't know that Jim Carrey was even in this movie and so when he was on camera several times I had no idea it was him I didn't know until right now! Same thing with Giovanni Ribisi! I kept thinking that there was something familiar about his character but I had no idea he was in this movie! So maybe do a little research and check out the IMDb obviously you're here LOL! When I first started watching this movie, I figured okay somebody with a lot of money decided to get a hold of Jason Momoa and Keanu Reeves and make a new Hills Have Eyes. And in the first 15-20 minutes that is it exactly how it looked. I was very disappointed. And then all the sudden, things open up and got really interesting. I kind of started seeing a Stephen King Dark Tower and I'm not talking about the stupid movie that came out that completely destroyed what Stephen King's original story was like I'm talking about the book the Canon! So I got very interested! And things slow down in a couple places and just as I started getting a little concerned and despondent about parts of the story, then all the sudden things sped up! So I kind of had an idea of the way that things were probably going to go and so did my husband and son apparently based on their emotional outbursts at the end of the movie when we discuss things afterwards we all kind of said we thought things were going to go a certain way which was not at all the way they went so I think the writers made a really bad decision and how they were going to handle the ending because the movie started out rough, like a typical Cannibal movie and then became more of a fantasy almost kind of movie, and I'm not going to spoil the end I just refuse to but suffice it to say we were disappointed. Who knows maybe they'll be a follow-up to make things better and that's why they left them the way they did. I still think it's a mostly worth seeing."
" Overrated
",2019-05-23 00:00:00,3,"This was a disappointment for me.I really don´t know, what was going on with these professional movie critics, or maybe I just don´t have a mind for modern art;
but this movie was just a strange puzzle of pictures.Well, it did have a plot, but there was no real story...The scenes where once colorful, then pychedelic, but just not entertaining.Although it´s not a ""bad"" movie, but just way way way too much ""a picture"" and too less ""a movie"".Don´t watch this, unless you are either on LSD or really have a big knowledge about modern art."
" Rate
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,1,"The only pity apart from wasting 2 hrs watching this sort of film, is not being able to rate a zero."
" Ever watch a Car Crash in Slow Motion?
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,7,"The first 15 minutes are shocking! From there, I felt as though my eyelids were forced open with toothpicks (I could not look away and did not want to blink).There are many attractive people and other visuals, and some action, to keep you going which is good as there is not much dialogue.The movie is slow, but who says every movie needs to be Bruce Willis's ""Die Hard""?If you made it this far into the reviews, you dont need another plot summary. It's an interesting film if you dig for meaning and/or want to experience drugs, and try to moralize cannibalism without actually taking part in such evil endeavors.Definitely not for everyone......but I liked it"
" Not Very Good
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,5,"THE BAD BATCH isn't all bad. It has some good moments. There are a few good scenes and a few nice surprises. Overall, however, it is not good. It's somewhat frustrating and actually pretty boring.It feels too long and several moments seem to drag on too much. It should have been trimmed down. And despite the good parts that I mentioned, it is not worth watching. It's a waste of time. Do not recommend."
" This film has one interesting aspect.
",2019-05-07 00:00:00,5,"I wanted to like this movie and had high hopes that I would because of the list of cast members. However, the only interesting aspect to this film was Jason Momoa. Momoa's acting talent and intriguing character is the only thing that kept this movie alive and somewhat intact. Not to mention he is mysteriously beautiful! OH MY GOD!!! Have I been living under a rock or something?!? Why on earth have I never noticed this strikingly handsome and talented actor before?!? I will definitely be seeking out Mr. Momoa's films/tv shows. To do list: Watch Aquaman and GOT! I digress! ;)"

" Assess your values before you watch this movie
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,8,"My title may seem confusing so let me explain it: if you are a person who sees the glass as half empty, then you will see this movie as weak, escapist, cannaibilism movie with a tweak of revenge. If, on the other hand, you see your glass as half-full, you will see a deeply complex political parable about the world we live in today even tho' this is set in a dystopian future. So think a few minutes before you dive in and certainly before you post your comments.I have thought about this film for some time and decided that I had to share this point of view for you. I like dystopian feature films so that was the first reason I jumped in.I do NOT like cannibal films and when Suki Waterhouse lost her arm and leg, I was ready to bail. Later, when Jason Moma was dressing a person he had killed in preparation for grilling, I was soooo soooo close to simply shutting dow this show.Then it hits me that Jim Carry is the Hermit; then Suki Waterhouse has a look which encouraged me to keep watching as she takes on the daughter of Moma; then there is Moma's character which compells me try a ferret out--is he good or is he bad.As with my last review, ""Hold the Dark,"" I began to see textture and characters and themes which encouraged me to stay and watch and enjoy.Then, of course, there are huge plot holes that drive me crazy: How does Keanu Reeves have this great place in the Waste Land where the ""bad batch"" are exiled? How do the dreamers have noodles to eat? What is the exchange rate? Where does Waterhouse get the gun she uses? How do the dreamers have access to electricity for the rave scene? I didn't see any explanation for these, as well as others!So I scored this an 8--its theme is well worth suffering through various atrocities and plot holes. The acting of Moma is worth watching. Waterhouse's long look after her action poses real soul searching. The final scene--I'm not going to give anything away--is provocative. Bottom line: answer the questions above--or at leat think about them--then you see what you think you see."
" TERRIBLE
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,3,"There is no Plot. Until the last 30 min of movie also not a well developed plot.

",2019-01-13 00:00:00,1,"I shouldn't write a review for a movie I didn't watch till the end. The only people who could possibly like this movie are art students or other such highly educated individuals. For the rest of us it's garbage. I finally gave up with 36 minutes to go. Just couldn't bring myself to see it through to the end. It has everything I look for in a movie but just doesn't work here. When one of the biggest stars in the movie has his name removed from the credits, alarm bells should start ringing."
" Truth in the title
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,3,"Just take every 80s cliche you can think of, toss it in a blender, hire a few name actors, film it for two weeks in a desert, and watch what comes out. It's just weird enough to make you wonder what horrible thing they'll do next and keep you watching to see what the answer is, but the final product is barely worth reviewing. Save your time and watch The Hills Have Eyes or Mad Max: Fury Road instead. They're much better examples of desert movies done right."
" Bought the soundtrack on iTunes.
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,1,Good soundtrack. That's it. A plodding mess of unoriginal ideas and a waste of some good talented actors.
" Really like it. Watched it numerous times now
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,8,"I actually liked this film. It has a grim start with the body dismembering. But thankfully doesn't turn into a all out gore fast. More like a daydream fantasy romance. Eerie and other worldly. The victim falls for the dangerous man. As many a women have in time ( Though falling for a cannibal is a little to far and something no sane person would ever do. But I guess this is what makes the feel it's own story and unique.. the cinematography is beautifully I love the trippy scenes where she's high and alone wandering the desert staring into the milkyway ( the music and scenery fit in perfect harmony) and then falls into her captors arms. Good soundtrack and the chemistry between the 2leading roles is amazing. You really feel it even though they barely speak. I found the main character Arlen just mesmerising you can not take your eyes off this white trash girl, she played her part well. The film has the mad max feel.. clearly this film isn't for everyone but I felt this movie.liked it's style. I'm saddened it's not got a higher score it's a good original piece. You can watch in our times now and worry this is where the future might head if things dont change. It's a deep film. But can understand not everyone will get its beauty.
UPDATE I have now a few years later just watched this director's A Girl walks home alone & it was absolute garbage not even good art film how that snooze fest got over 7 in her and this only has 5.6 is beyond me. Give bad batch some time and I think it will get followers just didnt have the right media promotion same as the film The guest"
" The highest rated worst movie I have ever seen
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,1,The beginning of the movie (first ten minutes) were awesome; gory and disturbing! And then it was just horrible. PAINFULLY slow and I absolutely had to shut it off about 50 minutes in and I wish I shut it off sooner.
" Awesome
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,9,"I like movies like this. It's slow, kinda. It's got cannibals, an apocalyptic-like wasteland, dismemberment, weird characters and a great soundtrack. I think all the bad reviewers watch too many Marvel movies. It's just an arty cannibal movie, with a bunch of limbless girls wandering around. Only thing it's lacking is chainsaws, but most movies are lacking those anyways."
" Poetic Allegory
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,8,"This film was interesting. I think it was supposed to be an allegory for the modern world. There is so much symbolism in the film, and I think many viewers may have missed it as well as the point of the movie. Yes, the pacing was rather slow, there is not much dialogue. I had to use a literary lens to look at this moving picture through, and I think if others did the same, it would've been more fulfilling for them. It offered a unique vision into the modern world, into our relationships, into what we spend our time working hard for and what we probably really desire. Jason Momoa was excellent, Jim Carrey, an absolute chameleon, and the lead actress, Suki Waterhouse was perfect in this role. I really liked the message and themes of the film, even if the pacing seemed slow, I believe that was intentional and does serve the story well actually."
" Boring and pointless.
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,2,"I tried three times to watch this movie all the way through. Dull, boring, goes nowhere.Past our heroine, Arlen, getting her arm and leg sawed off by cannibals, you now get to sit through nearly two hours of no plot or dialog.Absolutely the worst movie I've seen in ten years."
" What a cast
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,2,"This movie starts great then nothing happens, THE END!"
" Bizarre, yet boring.
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,3,"This film is all over the place. It's part Mad Max, part drug fuelled nonsense and occasionally horrific, which should at least have made it interesting, but there are big stretches where nothing happens and the dialogue is often terrible, so just ends up being a boring mess."
" Mediocre ""Mad Max goes to Burning Man"" adaptation
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,3,"I did not see any point in this film apart from some scenes of strong cinematography due to the desert backdrop. 
I am all for attempting to create a kitch ""dream"" but the film fails to do that. Instead the director Ana Lilly, seems to have put together a derivative cacophony of Mad Max with influences from the Hills have Eyes influenced from what it seems her latest week at Burning Man. 
The styling is generally mediocre, the soundtrack is mediocre and the violence is average and predictable. 
Yes the screenplay is nonsensical but I would welcome this if the visual, audio and aesthetics of the film compensated so I would be able to immerse myself into it without fast forwarding the last 55min"
" People are Idiots
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,8,"If you like 2000AD, Judge Dredd- The Wilderness Stories, Tank Girl, Mad Max (I could go on) this B Movie is for you. No budget just makes things better. Aqua Man's in it for flicks sake. Don't expect a polished X Man movie just a dirty B Movie with good ideas. Enjoy."
" Slow
",2018-10-06 00:00:00,2,Very slow movie with nothing to show for sitting through it.
" Weird, slow, but different and good on his own
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,6,"In a way, I'm struggling to rate appropriately the movie - we don't understand why some people get isolated to some kind of no man's land to live on their own, but however, it's not the most important as the movie is slow, there's no clear conception about what i supposed to happen, what's the purpose in the life of those people, but it seems some just survive, while other search some dream.The actors are famous, it's something that amazed me a bit, but they all play good roles and it can't be other way. To be honest, I didn't recognize Jim Carrey.Why I like it: because it's in any way a different movie, it's supposed to be artistic and it is as there're really nice scenes. And I liked the soundtrack, really strong.Overall a good dystopia, can even say there's some 80's movie note how the future is seen."

" Underrated movie
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,8,"This isnt an action packed movie, but I didnt find myself bored watching.Plot - Those unwanted by society are tattooed and dropped of in a desert wasteland to fend for themselves and survive. From drug use to cannibalism, those considered the Bad Batch do just that... cope and survive. Overall the plot was decent, with a central message. The protagonist overcame external and internal obstacles. Acting - 
Jason Mamoa played the part of the strong silent type very well. 
Suki Waterhouse was fairly decent... although she seemed to drop her accent multiple times.Overall the acting was mediocre.Cinematography - 
Lots of great shots. The camera definitely played it's part in telling the story. 
If you can enjoy a slow movie, you'll enjoy the bad batch. If you're looking for an action packed ball buster, this isnt the movie for you."
" Takes a little patience ...
",2018-09-21 00:00:00,9,"*spoiler or 2*
 I do not understand all the terrible ratings. I really thought this movie was entertaining! While yes, it was slow ... the whole point was living in a world with nothing left, and trying to find your way (even after SEVERE brutality). 
I thought Waterhouse and Mamoa were excellent, while Ribisi was wasted, and Keanu was VERY out of pocket as somewhat of a perv. And, tho I have never been a Jim Carrey fan, this was perhaps his best role. 
There are, basically, two camps here ... the ""Bad Batch"" (cannibalistic bad guys), and the city (for lack of a better word) of Comfort (supposed ""good guys"", tho, well ... you decide). In almost every ""apocalyptic"" movie you see, this inevitably leads to the big showdown, for all the marbles. But these two seem to have a binding truce, and no one tests that set-up. But, it appears, after the brutality inflicted on Waterhouse, she must decide where she belongs.
I am not a professional movie critic (obviously), but I judge a movie on one criteria ... did I like it, or not. And, I DID like this one. Do me a favor? Watch it with an open mind. Just don't expect zombies or a high body count."
" Wow...that was Bad!

" Who gets talked into financing these kind of movies?
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,3,I don't know how people can be talked into funding a movie that has no script. There is'nt any point to this movie. Does it take place in the 1980's or 2017? What laws were broken by all these people to make them complete outcasts of society? I should have stopped watching 10 minutes in. The reason I gave a 3 is it was nice cinematography and the lead characters are nice to look at.
" Not a bad batch, could have been real good
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,7,"Nice slow pace, not too much info given away, like it. Not brilliant, but pretty oke. not below 6 is not fair, seen much worse. So i say, 7, go for it if u're not in a hurry, and don't mind missing limbs"
" For you to interpret...
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,8,"If you don't want to read into metaphors and find your own meaning in an abstract piece of art, this movie probably isn't for you. For me, I enjoyed the slow progression and dialogue, as it gave me time to analyze the story and find my own meaning in it. If you only like films that have explicit storylines without much to read into, this one probably isn't for you. However, if you like leaving a movie not knowing what all of it meant but leaves you still thinking about it, you might like this one."
" Surprisingly Good.
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,6,"After watching this film for the first time, I decided to wait a while before saying anything about it. After two months, I watched it again and decided that this was well worth a second view.The story is pretty typical for the genre of undesirables exiled to a wasteland. Yes, some felt compelled to resort to cannibalism as the easier strategy. And yet, there's a haven of sorts, if one is willing to find it. The lead character, played by Suki Waterhouse, does an admirable job - but Jim Carrey is the real surprise - dramatically entertaining in a completely unexpected role. Even Keanu Reeves' portrayal of a dubious but benevolent ""desert sultan"", replete with breeding harem. is spot on. An agreeable fellow who is just too smooth to be truly likable. Jason Momoa's character remains an unpredictable cut-throat who may or may not turn out to be one of the most depraved amongst these outcasts.I would be tempted to rate the film higher if the story had been a little more imaginative. Kudos to the director for coping with the harsh environment - and the in-camera special effects that largely took care of the scenes that required them. I'll be happy to upgrade my rating in future, if I find that the film continues to grow on me."

" Massively underrated gem of a movie!
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,8,"I really don't understand why this movie has such a low score. The acting is superb, utilizing star actors like Jim Carrey (who I didn't even recognize), Keanu Reeves and Giovani Ribisi in small characteristic roles, while putting full weight of the movie onto Suki and Momoa, which they all perform to the highest grade. 
This movie is uneasy and strange in many ways and after the shocker of first 10 minutes you don't even know what to expect.
At the end the whole movie feels like something you have never seen, yet somehow (on the feeling level?) reminds you of Tideland and Wristcutters: A Love Story. It is completely off-beat, sometimes awkward, sometimes beautiful, funny and scary, but definitely gripping.
Just as a cherry on the top, the music ties it all into something of a must see!P.S. If you like Die Antwoord it gives you several pleasant surprises! ;)"
" Actors Performance Is Great But Movie Is Buring Time Waster
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,3,"It's Really Nothing Special Movie Just Actors and I Am Such Big Fan of Jason Momoa and Keanu Reeves but they don't face up each another in scene in movie, I Thought this is worth watching for Gorgeous (Suki Waterhouse) Insurgent, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, Pusher she is lead star in movie Jason Momoa is like 2nd act and then Keanu is 3rd or 4th act in movie he is not really in movie that much. I Thought this was slow burning time waster i almost fell asleep me watching this in Netflix. I Wanted to give a look of movie i thought it could be Interesting Movie to watch it's nothing like Eli Roth Trash Green Inferno or Cannibal Holocaust movie does Involved Cannibal people but it's not that kind of flick not in a extreme Violence movie it's slow ,boring, quiet, actors are just looking at each another doing nothing, one of them don't talk, it's boring film nothing Interesting about watching this flick. Story doesn't tell nothing about how Arlen (Suki Waterhouse) got transported to this desert dystopia, Prison guards tattooed her side of her head like prisoner lock her up in Desert In an unspecified near future. it's processed and dropped inside a fenced-in area outside of Texas where people being deemed undesirable by society (the ""bad batch"") are forced to live and fend for themselves as outcasts. A sign declares that the area is considered outside of the U.S. and that American laws and citizenship no longer apply. why could of this movie could have been a Apocalypse movie a real Apocalypse like Mad Max style not a world where with no Apocalypse made movie like a Apocalypse but not really of it movie, it doesn't explain why people are living their are they most dangerous Criminals ? is that why they getting locked up ? what's up with this movie it doesn't any sense why because of dream ? come on it doesn't make any sense of no matter what oh people just wanna live their, it has to be reason but do they explain it ? no they don't. so anyway Arlen is alright character but their are moments where she made stupid decisions at middle of movie, she got kidnapped her arm and leg been cut off by Cannibals then she kills it and then runs off then she has been living their for 5 months movie is really nothing, just nothing, nothing and like i said it's nothing The Screamer (Giovanni Ribisi) has done nothing in this movie just acts like crazy person he is nothing he does nothing he is only in it for second then that's it. The Hermit is (Jim Carrey) i am like what ? really he has no script nothing in this movie you don't really know he was in this movie ? he is not really in it i am what the f could hired different person not random actor we all know then actor has done nothing in this movie he is really nothing in movie why ? paycheck easy to act. that's all i could say that's Jim Carrey everyone he plays like quiet bum guy who doesn't speak. The Dream (Keanu Reeves) i love and love Keanu movies Point Break, Speed, Johnny Mnemonic, The Matrix Franchise, Constantine, Street Kings, 47 Ronin, John Wick 1 and 2 love it to death, then after his different movies sucked as hell like this one and worser one is Exposed aka Daughter of God even more worse and worser movie then to this his character is some kind of god or something he is called dream and he hasn't done nothing in this movie at all nothing at all just looked like a 70's porn star Mustache he should been doing porno movies Keanu Reeves because he looks like 70's Porn star with hair at that the way his dressed he looks like a 70's Porn Star jeez his character is not really much him and Suki had a good acting scene in movie. (Jason Momoa) Miami Man he has nothing to do in movie he is just quiet, he is a tattoo artist a printer who draws a lot of good pictures he is not much in movie he is a mysterious character, part i liked when he threw butcher knife at guy and saves Arlen he is not much of character his performance in movie is ok but he is Cuban Character you don't understand what he is saying in movie of his Cuban accent which makes me saying what ? he is looking for little girl name honey (Jayda Fink)she doesn't speak in movie at all not until in very end of movie their's not much to say about this movie just Quiet movie, everyone is looking each another just doing nothing, very empty movie no point of been made just lame flick that has nothing to watch it's Slow Burning Time Waster that's all i could say. 3.10 not worst movie i have ever saw their's a lot of movies i have seen are worse then this."
" Terrible and Awful and Sloooooooooooow
",2018-06-21 00:00:00,1,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Slow with very little dialogue and not much of a point. Hard to talk about the acting because no one really does or says anything. I think whoever wrote this was on drugs, and maybe you have to be on drugs to understand the point of it. It is really one of the worst movies I've every seen. If this even qualifies as a movie."
" I really wanted to like this movie
",2018-06-14 00:00:00,4,"There was some serious potential here, but it completely falls flat in the 2nd act. I am totally going to spoil it here so be warned. So she starts out being captured by cannibals, who proceed to cut off and eat her arm and leg. She then escapes and kills one of the cannibals and is rescued by a hermit. Okay. Then she goes back later with a new leg and kills another one and takes the kid with her presumably to give her a better life or at least not leave her in the desert, even though that would be and was the first place her father looked. She gets messed up at a party and looses the kid and gets captured again by a cannibal. Then somehow is rescued by some rando good guy and goes back to the safety of the city. So what does she do now? She searches everywhere for the girl and when she finally finds her, she hatches some stupid plan to risk her life and get the girl back from a life of luxury and ease, just so she can return her to her cannibal father who she apparently has feelings for despite only knowing him for a day when he kidnapped her. They then eat her pet rabbit and it fades to black. What? These cannibals just ate half of her and now she risks her life and joins them because.....why?? Did she seriously develop Stockholm syndrome in one hungover day in the desert?Ugh. The acting, writing, and direction is sub par at best. It is obvious that they really tried to make this a cool movie but just couldn't put the pieces together. It had a few moments where I thought they were on the right track but they were few and far between and it ultimately was a bad batch."
" Worst Director EVER
",2018-06-11 00:00:00,1,"Only Jim Carrey is worth watching and that's not a lot.
The rest of the film is a meaningless crap loaded with some trippy music.

" What did I just watch???
",2018-05-09 00:00:00,3,"Ok, I'll be honest, the main reason I watched this movie is because I saw Keanu Reeves was in it. However, Reeves has plays a very small role and only occupies about 10 minutes of this movie. I'm also a big fan of post-apocalyptic films, but this is no mad max. The movie starts off well with an intensely engaging introduction, however, the first ten minutes is the only excitement you'll enjoy for the rest of this snooze fest. I really didn't see the point to this movie. It was grossly under developed and only left you with wanting so much more."
" Tedious, pretensious nonsense
",2018-04-26 00:00:00,2,"Wow, what a complete load of deluded crap this is.Not a bad idea with assembling all the crims in one place like Escape from New York but it really is the perfect example of a director that believes themselves to be hip, cool and super talented.Really, if a character is walking somewhere you don't need to show me them walking for literally 3 or 4 minutes, I've got it, film something.The money they spent on special lenses and tedious tracking shots should have been spent on the virtually non-existent script. A boring, non entertaining piece of self important trash."

" Bizarre post-apocalyptic film without a true purpose
",2018-04-04 00:00:00,7,"""The Bad Batch"" heavily borrows elements from ""Mad Max"" but without concluding to anything really, having a slow narrative with minimum dialogue.The film takes place in an post-apocalyptic desert wasteland and follows a young woman captured by cannibals who chop off her right arm and leg and plan to eat her piece by piece. She eventually escapes the cruelty of those creatures, led by Jason Momoa, and wander off into the desert. There really isn't any plot or main story, the protagonist treks the empty barren land until she meets various strangers, like a helpful but crazy hermit, played questionably by Jim Carrey, who's current real-life state of affair could probably be transposed into the character with ease. Keanu Reeves also plays a strange person called the Dream, the cult leader of a settlement.
With more depth to the characters and back-story, I think this film could have turned out nicely, while adding maybe another side-story to it.The film's soundtrack was definitely odd, from Ace of Base to Die Antwoord to strange rave music. I was confused on what feelings to assess by connecting the scenes with the music.""The Bad Batch"" is definitely one of those bizarre and offbeat independent movies that fall under the radar. I wouldn't say it was a good or bad movie and it wouldn't be on the top of my head when recommending post-apocalyptic movies, but ""The Bad Batch"" had some interesting parts that I probably won't forget for some time."
" ""You're either gonna love it...

So sayeth co-star Jason ""Game of Thrones"" Momoa in the making-of feature appended to this dire sophomore effort from auteur Ana Lily ""A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night"" Amirpour. Count me in the latter camp. Replete with vapid, slumming appearances by the likes of Keanu ""John Wick"" Reeves, Giovanni ""Saving Private Ryan"" Ribisi, and Jim ""The Mask"" Carrey, this ""A Boy and His Dog"" wannabe fails to engage on almost any level. Ms. Amirpour obviously had a very personal apocalyptic fairy tale to disgorge from her inner self, but it simply doesn't connect to the wider zietgeist of human behavior. Doesn't help that her lead, Suki ""Insurgent"" Waterhouse, who for some odd reason appears to be a high-demand talent judging from the slew of films she's done recently that are all due out this year, nonetheless appears to have the acting chops (pardon the pun) of a mannequin. Meanwhile, Amirpour's meandering, sketchy script doesn't help. Insomniac viewing only, and I'd be willing to bet that very few people can get through ""The Bad Batch"" without hitting fast-forward more than once. It gets its points from me strictly for some nice DP work from Lyle ""The Woman in Black"" Vincent."
" One of the few films that truly deserves a 10/10
",2018-03-27 00:00:00,10,"If you look through my extensive history of rating movies over the many years of being an imdb member, you would know that I only reserve good grades for most special of films. I grade things with brutal honesty and it takes A LOT to get me to grade something a 7, let along 8 or 9 but this, I strongly feel, deserves a 10. Yes a ten. Camera work is spectacular. Scene composition is absolutely amazing. Most of the scenes do not even require dialogue. Every gesture, every facial expression, every little detail was not missed. Watching silent clips was like watching entire conversation because it was about the scene.... not some lazy rehashed instant gratification copy paste algorithm that is applied to movies. This movie literally had a story line and that story line was of a post apocalyptic no hope at all, no light at the end of the tunnel... just surviving sort of thing. From the first few minutes to brutality of what came after to wandering about the universe that was created by the writer/director... it was hitting all the right buttons. Watching this on my home projector on a 10 foot wide screen just blew entire movie out of the water. I felt that it was a breath of fresh air. I felt that this movie was exactly what I was looking for. Granted to the most impatient one, this movie is certainly a no go. This is not about gore, this is not about action... this is not some mad max 2 with Charlize theron driving about the desert. This was about anything but that. I felt drawn to the story line for a change and helped by amazing scenery and stunning videography it just made a 5 and then a 6 and then an 8 and then a 10. Whether it was something as simple as sun blistered character or random bizzare group of people who clearly did not fit in.... this movie just kept getting better and better for me. I am so thankful that I ordered it on Netflix. I can see how this little gem can be clearly overlooked."

",2018-03-24 00:00:00,3,"Watched this rather long, slow movie while de-fragmenting my hard drive. Interesting flick, but that does not make it good. I'm giving it three whole stars because the music was okay, the song selections were okay, listenable, and some of the cinematography/ visual effects of things like mountains, desert scapes and stars were well done and attractive.
The story is, however, neither well done nore attractive. And did I say the movie was long? It was too long for the inaction involved.
Our star is a sweet young thing in cutoffs who crosses a dangerous border and finds herself cutoff in more ways than one. She escapes one human 'tribe' and wanders into another.
There are some big name actors playing supporting or minor roles in this professional appearing bit of trivia.
I got the strong impression that the author / screenwriter director was motivated by Tarentino's Grindhouse products. That admiration did not absorb the action or humor of these pieces, however.
Watch this in order to break down your date into a bored yet disgusted heap."
" liked the cast and part of the story didn't like the plot.
",2018-03-01 00:00:00,6,"To sum this movie up it's different. The main character Suzuki what's her face is pleasing to the eye. You have Kal Drogo being Kal Drogo I guess. Never understand why this guy plays characters with strange dialogue. Keanu Reeves, and I didn't even realize it was Jim Carrey. I mean the movie has all the elements but the story revolves around a little girl that I clearly could care less about. She's not even a likable character but the plot just circles around her and those ""find the child"" type of movies are always the worst. I mean name one movie about saving or finding a kid that's good. I mean I can only think of 1 and that's Terminator 2 and that's because that movie didn't suck. I give this movie 6 stars because I like the atmosphere, the cast, it was shot well but the plot... was it ever terrible. I mean stick to the basics of desert wasteland. Controlling the water or the fuel or whatever resource people need to survive throw in the bad guy in control of it all and then the heroine trying to stop them and free the people so they can have access to said resource without being slaves. I mean that's every futuristic desert wasteland story this one should of just stuck to that and it would of been a good movie. Instead we get a movie about a kid you don't care about and a dumb ending that makes no sense."
" Find Comfort
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,4,Arlen (Suki Waterhouse) is placed into a land of misfits behind a fence any Mexican could get through. The desert area is divided up and Arlen ends up in a city of cannibals which costs her an arm and a leg before she manages to escape on a dolly and picked up by a guy pushing a shopping cart through the sand with ease. She ends up in a town run by Keanu Reeves where everyone smokes pot and does acid.The film was not the Mad Max action film I was expecting. It was far more drama and I am still not sure of the whole point of the film or the ending. She found her dream? That's weak. Keanu Reeves had a small but important role. Suki Waterhouse was the star of the film. Jason Momoa grunted most of his lines. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.
" Pointless and Stupid
",2018-02-12 00:00:00,2,"Bad acting, bad script, bad direction. I can't understand how they got some of these actors to agree to be in this mess. It had a good premise and set up. It had potential. But someone forgot to write a script before movie production time. It was a complete bore and a complete waste of time. It went nowhere and did nothing. I gave it an extra star because I have to commend 'somebody' for getting Giovani Ribisi and Keanau Reeves to show up. They obviously didn't read the script first either. I never thought Jason Momoa could act. Then Justice League proved me wrong and he actually made Aquaman cool -- Which was no easy trick. I thought I'd give him another shot here. With The Bad Batch, he proves me right. He got lucky with JL and should only do Aquaman from now on. How he keeps getting other roles is a head-scratcher. Having a beach body, agreeing to do an entire film with your shirt off and only saying about 4 words must have been the only acting requirement for this casting agent. I needed at least a little more."
" An amazing experience
",2018-02-08 00:00:00,8,"""The Bad Batch"" is an extraordinary film. It is almost unlike anything I've ever seen. The only movie I can think of, off the top of my head that comes close, is ""Gummo"".I'd say ""The Bad Batch"" is better, though. It has so many amazing moments, its visual style is so powerful, and it takes you so completely inside its community of outcasts.I had never seen anything by this director, but she is clearly one to watch."
" Slowly but surely: one of the most original films of the decade.
",2018-02-06 00:00:00,8,"If I was asked to describe The Bad Batch in a classic Hollywood motto, I'd have to go with ""Mad Max meets Jim Jarmusch"". I only began watching because I am a fan of Jason Momoa, but after the ten minute mark, I knew this film was going to be good. First off all, this is not for people who want constant action and a fast plot. The film progresses slowly but surely; there are scenes that do not contribute to the main plot, and characters whose developments are left incomplete. Moreover, Both the directing style of Amirpour and the plot suggests spontaneity. Therefore the whole film may be described as ""a post-apocalyptic ramble"".The remarkable cast is led by the amazing future star Suki Waterhouse, Jason Momoa, Giovanni Ribisi, Keanu Reeves and an uncredited Jim Carrey as ""The Hermit"". The leading cast's portayal of their rambling characters blends perfectly with the spontaneous plot of the film. Lastly, the soundtrack of the film is one of the most beautiful I encountered in a long while. Great work."
" In the land of savages!
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,5,"The overall concept was good, but I did not like the initiation. I don't like any film of cannibalism. I don't know why such films are made. What's the point! Definitely not entertainment or art. It could only encourage such savage culture. So I thought I made a mistake picking it to watch. Except the opening, the rest of the film was different. Then ended as a just below average product.In a near future, where all the criminals, illegal immigrants are dumped in a waste desert land. So they have made their own system, divided by two. One the savages and the other is kind of civilised, but not without flaws. A new arrival who experience from both the end, had to decide where she belongs when a series of bad events had taken place.Here comes another film from a woman director. Her previous film was one of the worst in the history of filmdom. And again this is not her best work either. Though I liked the cast. They all performed well, particularly Jim Carrey. Yes, I did not recognise him at first. Then there's Keanu Reeves. But Waterhouse was good. I wish her a good future. Generally not recommended, but then it's your choice!5/10"

" Post-apocalyptic story that's so heavy on metaphor it loses it's narrative
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,5,"Visually striking and an interesting story premiss are undone by arthouse pretentiousness, a slow pace, and a lack of narrative. The film opens with our heroine, Suki Waterhouse as Arlen, being expelled from the United State as an undesirable, part of the ""bad batch"" and left to fend for herself in a post apocalyptic vision of Trump's America, where the powerful literally feed off of the still living corpses of the downtrodden. Once across the border, Arlen is promptly captured and has an-arm-and-a-leg (Get it? An-are-and-a-leg?) chopped off to feed a group of bodybuilding cannibals led by Jason Momoa. Although this sounds very ""The Hills Have Eyes"" it's more like an arthouse version of ""Cherry 2000."" Make that a slow moving and highly pretentious version of ""Cherry 2000."" In terms of tone, I'd compare the film to something like ""Six-String Samurai"" or maybe ""Bagdad Cafe"" and a bit of ""El Too,"" but nowhere as good as any of those. Besides Momoa's cannibal leader Miami Man, who Arlen inexplicably crushes on, Keanu Reeves plays a cult leaders called The Dream, and an unrecognizable Jim Carrey plays a shopping cart pushing wastelander. ""The Bad Batch"" is an obvious and heavy-handed metaphor for Donald Trump's America, which is certainly a ripe topic for filmmakers to exploit, but when the metaphors about the haves and the have-nots and the powerful and the powerless are so in your face, the film just becomes annoying. I'm fine with arthouse message films, but they need to at least be either entertaining or present ideas that challenges my thinking, and this film did neither. However, Waterhouse is very good in the lead and writer/director Ana Lily Amirpour brings strong visuals to the film, which were both enough to hold my attention. Overall, this film needed to either have more interesting of ideas behind it's metaphors or barring that have more Escape from New York/Mad Max post-apocalyptic action."
" It's pretty unfortunate.
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,4,"You can actually see some interesting ideas under the chassis, and elements that work in isolated parts of the film. There's an opportunity here to have a kind of Yojimbo-style storyline with a protagonist caught between two equally dangerous forms of evil, Miamiman's desert cannibals and the pimp/drug kingpin/cult leader calling himself The Dream. There were the bones of a really interesting story here and short stretches -- the brutal opening sequence, the surreal journey into The Dream's household -- where you can see what it could have been. The cannibals *feel* viscerally evil, even banally so as when we see them murdering and eating people as part of just normal family lie. The Dream and his empty-eyed, uzi-wielding concubines *feel* viscerally creepy and wrong even with Keanu Reeves' typically, um, limited acting talent interposed as a filter. The dilemma of what to do with a child who's been born into the ""Miamiman"" lifestyle is potentially quite interesting and could have brought out different sides of the protagonist.Unfortunately, it's mostly a misfire. Agonizingly slow, the film attempts very long stretches of wordless storytelling with actors who mostly don't have the chops to pull it off. The pretty visuals -- and they are pretty -- can't make up for the stultifying stretches of watching people walk around or stare at each other. The two real A-lister acting talents on display (Ribisi and Carrey) are almost criminally wasted. Gorgeous as Waterhouse and Momoa both are, they just aren't lead material as actors and can't bring alive the incredibly flawed material they're working with.Worse yet is that the minimal story and characters spiral into the nonsensical whenever they're actually allowed to move forward. The final sequence is cringingly lame and makes no sense for any of the characters involved, as if the filmmakers just painted themselves into a corner and then gave up.I'm not sorry I watched it, but I don't recommend it."
" Worth a Watch, but with time to reflect on afterwards
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,8,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film up until the trip scene, my attention dipped in and out there. The day after watching it thinking back I felt it had interesting themes. I would recommend this to some one into art-house films similar to the likes of directors Harmony Korine. If you are used to Hollywood blockbusters its not for you, its pacing is slow and its one to think on rather than get immediate satisfaction.The film explores themes of normalization to violence, body image, Neotribalism, social outcasting, survivalist and more. There is no mass culture portrayed in the film but rather a mix of cultures where one is not prevalent over the other. I feel this portrays society today where subcultures such as Goth, Punk and Jock are dying out into very individualistic modes of culture. The character of Miami man displays this best as a bodybuilder listening to culture club who is a caring father, 
and an artist but yet is normalized to violence and is a cannibal. Die Antwoord play in our introduction to this character who I feel sum him up brilliantly with the similarities to ZEF culture.His character defies our social norms he has both good and bad traits which can be difficult for most people to relate to, but I feel that it paints a realistic character who has to get on with life in a dystopian world where realistically meat is not gonna be found in large masses in the desert. It is also worth noting the body image portrayed by Miami Mans tribe vs the other, is this due to their diet.Die Antwoord for me has a strong influence on this film not only in the reference to the band in Yellow shorts but also this ZEF culture. The main role is similar to that of Yolandi in her petite but strong portrayal.Jim Carey's character is great in this film, for an actor who is so outspoken, loud in films his character here is a total contrast, the real Jim Carey shines through in his posing for Miami Mans drawing. His role is small but works. I wasn't familiar with the actress playing Arlene and was fooled to think the actress was a real amputee at first. she carries a confused look throughout the film, which is what I feel makes her character work, she is trying to settle into a society where she doesnt have a place. I feel her reliance on Momoa at the end is one of survival, rather than love (which for me is a comment on real life relationships), but is also an understanding that Momoa has learned to fit in, in order to continue.overall great visuals and audio with some interesting themes and comments on society, great performance from lead role, I felt personally Reeves character didnt work. I would have liked to see a more less known actor for his role."
" Mad Max Meets Hannibal Lecter
",2017-12-31 00:00:00,3,"The main criticism I have with user reviews are ones where the reviewer admits to watching only a fraction of a film before sharing his 'expert' opinion. I watched this movie from beginning to end, and was not impressed. A group of undesirables are gathered together by the powers that be, abandoned in the desert to fend for themselves. Not really a horror film, not really science fiction, not really much of anything. The film DOES seem to offer characters for everyone; body builders, skater boys, ravers, Hispanic gang members, amputees (soup's on!) and pregnant women, inseminated by the leader, played by a pasty and out of shape Keanu Reeves. I won't delve into the plot, but suffice it to say it plays like Burning Man on acid. Mercifully, there is a minimum of dialog. An example spoken by the lead, ""What if all these things that happen to us so the next things that happen to us can happen to us?"" Say WHAT? The biggest shocker (besides the gratuitous violence) was discovering that Jim Carey played the role of the hermit. If you enjoyed the movie ""Drifter"" (which I HATED!) you should like ""The Bad Batch""."
" Does the (female) director hate women?
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,1,"First, I am NOT a feminist, in fact, I cannot stand modern-day feminism. Just making that clear right now. And having said that, this movie literally offended me because of how many (negative) female tropes the main character was guilty of.(spoilers)The main (female) character:1.) Immediately gets captured and exploited -- a trope, because women are weak, I guess. She loses two limbs. As a trope, this didn't bother me so much because it could've happened to anyone in her situation if they had no way to hide or defend themselves, but I'm still including it because of everything else that happened afterward.2.) Is spoiled and never happy. Even after being rescued and brought to a safe place by Jim Carrey, she decides to wander back out towards the place where she got her limbs cut off. Spoiled brat trope. Cool.3.) She uses the bait of sex to steal something from a wealthy and powerful man, who, honestly, didn't do much wrong. Keanu took the lost girl, which could be viewed as wrong yes, but the girl WAS lost and without a guardian at the time. Yes, the main character's goal WAS to retrieve the girl back from Keanu, but could she not have maybe simply ASKED him before resorting to using the ol' seduce-and-betray trope? Oh, and the only reason Keanu was able to take ownership of the lost girl in the first place was... number 4...4.) Our ""heroine"" took this little girl (she's basically her guardian at that point in the movie), to a RAVE. That's bad enough on its own. Then, she willingly ingested hallucinogens and started tripping out instead of watching her kid. (She could have spit out the drugs if she was only worried about being accepted by the townspeople of Comfort. Or maybe, you know, just don't go to the rave at all if you've made the decision to be a parent.) So, she's a bad mother too. Another trope. Nice!5.) Our heroine is also a brainless ditz. She has no purpose or goals and her morals change on a whim. She's a complete idiot. Another female trope -- the braindead bimbo.6.) Here's the kicker: (After stealing something from the stable, wealthy man, Keanu,) she ends up falling for the bad boy. The bad boy, being, one of the cannibals that participated in the feast of eating her arm and leg in the beginning of the movie. I couldn't make that up. So she's a brainless bimbo who falls for an abusive meathead who has no moral issues with killing and eating other human beings. Because women are irresistibly attracted to abusive men. Whoooo!Keep in mind the writer/director is female.If this was a comedy or some kind of ""ironic"" movie that's meant to show the absurdity of certain tropes, then things would be different, but the movie presents itself as 100% serious, intelligent and thought-provoking.I haven't even discussed the plot yet. And I would gladly discuss the plot, if there was one.If you're looking for a decent (well, ""decent"" in terms of Netflix movies) post-apoc movie with a female lead, try ""The Last Survivors"". Only watch The Bad Batch if you're a masochist and you genuinely enjoy making yourself upset."
" What is the movie all about?
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,1,"I've been watching the movie and tried to figure out what it's all about. 
This movie is just a waste of time watching it. I never wanted to watch this one, first the title doesn't tell me much, the cover.. not interesting, the storyline???"
" Tries too hard to be something that its not
",2017-12-25 00:00:00,6,"This film desperately attempts to portray itself as being supremely sophisticated and abstract artsy. It tries to fall into the category of a being an instant ""cult classic"" However, despite the first half or two thirds of the movie being somewhat interesting and having some potential, the rest of it just falls flat on its post apocalyptic face. The accents are cheesy, the music often times feels forced and over imposed and the acting is... alright I guess... One of the biggest problems with this movie is that it's a little too slow paced at times with the camera focusing too much on scenes that should have been time lapsed or edited out. The ending, like much of the film, is irrational, just like the protagonists motivations which start off being based off of primal instincts but end up leaving the viewer confused over her arbitrary decision making process. I mean, in the end, rather than lead a descent life in a town with civilized human beings, who seem to be providing for her, giving her food and her own place to stay even though she doesn't seem to be contributing in any way, she chooses to throw it all away, leave it all behind to go and live with the same cannibals who abducted her and tore her limb from limb to eat her flesh while they held her captive ? but WHY ? Also wasn't the little girl better off in the town of Comfort? Wouldn't she have had a much better and brighter future there ? I mean I can understand how the film tries to portray the town of Comfort as being corrupt and shallow at its core. After all, it is run by an EVIL AND SINISTER Keanu Reeves (sarcasm), who does a shitty impersonation of a post apocalyptic, drug addicted? hippyesque Hew Hefner (with a flabby body) who's also some sort of weird philosophical drug lord messiah / leader type who rambles endlessly, mostly about shit, toilets and his own delusions of grandeur... but REALLY what's the worst part about it all ? Okay sure they've giving out drugs and everyone is high every night and Keanu mentions that the economy seems to be dependent on drugs (which he controls I guess), but on the bright side they're not forcing people to do drugs, they actually seem to be giving out the drugs for free and the best part of it all is that in a barren wasteland apocalyptic nightmare they seem to be civilized, accommodating and accepting... Yes I can understand that she (the protagonist) has some sort of weird chemistry with Momoa... but WHY ? Is it because they were close to each other in a few scenes ? Or is it because he saved her from that big black dude with the BBC (jk) ? But he only saved her from the black guy because he needed her as a means to an end, to get his daughter back.. Sure there is some chemistry between the two and maybe she has a thing for tough bad guys but COME ON this is the same guy who's in charge of the group of cannibals who were eating her, one limb at a time.. LET ME REPEAT THAT... they were EATING HER ONE LIMB AT A TIME and they already ate one of her arms and one of her freakin legs... In fact Momoa's character probably ate some of it himself...In the end, I don't know what to make of this film... I really don't... All I can say is that it's weird, excruciatingly slow and after the halfway point, very predictable. Also after the halfway point the main characters motivation seems arbitrary and almost silly considering the situation... All in all, 6/10 for the effort and potential. Should you watch it ? I would say, just watch MAD MAX, you'll be better off because at least that movie doesn't try to be something that it's not and the story is much more rational than this one."

" Not bad, but definitely flawed, Keanu Reeves is terrible as usual
",2017-12-11 00:00:00,4,"I like a good quasi-futuristic story about a dystopian wasteland. This is not bad, and has some good ideas, but definitely flawed in a few ways. First of all, Mamoa is good, as usual. The other actors, not so much. I have to take a moment here to point out Keanu Reeves has got to be the absolute worst actor to ever make it big. I mean, this guy simply can not act. His performance in most movies can only be described as terrible. He sucks as an actor.Spoilers! Arlen (Suki) is captured by a barbaric tribe of cannibals. She is immediately used for food, having her arm and leg brutally amputated. Considering that she is very pretty and about 20 years old, I find this to be extremely ridiculous, especially comparing her to the other women that are in the camp, who appear to be either ugly or old. There is NO way that the tribe leaders, such as Mamoa's character, would allow a girl like Arlen to be used up as food. They would have used her as a sex slave, no question about it. Then Arlen escapes and finds her way to a town called ""Comfort."" This part reminded me of Fallout 3. I love that game and I like the concepts, and I think they were handled well in this movie. But shortly after she makes her way to this protected city, she is immediately set up with money, a prosthetic leg, a gun, and even a little house. It is never explained how she earns any of the commodities she gets. Why? How? If you are a fan of Fallout, you know that nothing in the wasteland is free. So how did she come to establish herself so well? Inside the city, she seems to have a pretty safe, easy existence. They have electricity and even entertainment. So why would she want to leave? No explanation for that.I can understand that she falls in love with Jason Mamoa's character, even though it was HIS people who hacked her arm and leg off. But after she makes it back to ""Comfort,"" why on earth would she choose to go back to him? She must know that choosing to be his bride means that she will have to embrace a life of brutal cannibalistic practices. She is OK with that? And if so, then that makes it very difficult for us as an audience to sympathize with her. So she goes to the DJ (horribly played by Reeves) who has kindly adopted Mamoa's lost daughter. We see that the DJ is treating the little girl very nicely, giving her a very comfortable place to live, not harming her at all, letting her keep her cuddly pet rabbit, and feeding her spaghetti...ya know, instead of HUMAN FLESH. It seemed to me that, in order to retrieve the little girl, Arlen could have easily just approached the DJ character and explained the situation. He didn't seem to be brutal or cruel. He was just an affluent person living within the little society of ""Comfort."" But instead of explaining the situation and at least asking to take the girl back to her father, Arlen hatches a violent plot to take a hostage at gunpoint and kidnap the little girl. In the course of the kidnapping, it seemed like there were plenty of opportunities for the DJ and his female body guards to take action against Arlen, but they choose not to. Which only furthers our assumption that the DJ is not a violent or cruel character, and he probably would have been open to Arlen simply explaining the situation and asking for the girl in a friendly way. As Arlen leaves the gates of ""Comfort,"" we hear a guard say to her, ""Don't come back you crazy bitch."" I was thinking that was exactly what I would have said to her. So, again, as an audience member, I have NO sympathy for the protagonist in this movie. Big flaw. Finally Arlen reunites the little girl with her father, Mamoa. The little girl doesn't really seem that thrilled. She is happy to see her dad, and that is a touching moment. But then, her father, needing food to feed his daughter, takes his daughter's poor little bunny rabbit, rips it's head off and feeds it to her. Seems to me she would have been a lot better off with the DJ. In fact, as she is asking Mamoa for food, she says, "" I want spaghetti. The other man gave me spaghetti."" A quick side note about the end scene where Mamoa, the little girl, and Arlen are feasting on the little girl's rabbit: where did they get all those rocks to build the fire pit? They are sitting in the middle of a dry lake bed with no other rocks like that around. Did they run out to the edge of the dry lake bed and gather rocks and then run back to the middle of the dry lake bed? If so, no wonder they were so hungry. They need to be more careful how they expend their energy. I am glad that I rented this movie instead of buying it on Blue Ray. It was worth watching and it was interesting to see Jim Carey in such a different role (with absolutely no lines whatsoever). Also, when Jim Carey's character trades Mamoa a snow globe for a knife, that seemed like a terrible trade. I seriously doubt that a survivalist like Mamoa would have agreed to such a trade and he would have taken the knife back, probably killing Carey's character in the process. Let me just say these problems with the movie do not surprise me when I take in to consideration who wrote and directed it. I give it some severed thumbs up, but mostly the severed thumbs are down."
" The Really Bad Batch
",2017-11-22 00:00:00,1,"Boring. Slow. A. Waste. Of. Time. I love apocalyptic genre films. I am intrigued by the what if aspects of how one survives the end. But this movie is a gigantic bore. There is barely any dialogue. The scenery is bare and there are all these long sequences and panoramic shots of walking, someone in the distance wandering, yada yada. I am baffled why Jim Carrey, Giovanni Ribisi and Keanu Reeves would be part of this train wreck. The description states this is a romance - nope! There is zero romance going on here. There's nothing thrilling either. The actions of the main character - who is unimpressive - is questionable at best. And the ending makes no sense whatsoever. Again, a huge waste of time. This is definitely one of the worst films I've seen (and I have seen some really bad movies before)."
" Oh boy. I wanted to like this. But it just feels not honest.
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,5,"The title actually says it all. I feel like this is the outcome of a brainstorm with the main goal to please Hipsters. Get VICE to produce. Put in Burgers, Skateboards, long camera shots (but not long enough to be art-house, just long enough to be wannabe edgy) and of course Die Antwoord in the soundtrack. Oh and neon boomboxes and scene that rips off Vincent Gallo's DJ scene in Kasper Hauser. It just all feels fake and constructed. Not honestly hip like Harmony Korine who just doesn't give a f***But this all said, it's still better to have a failed movie like this featured on Netflix then another Season of some over-hyped series. So kudos to all the supporters of high budget Indie movies like this."
" Interesting enough
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,7,"The Bad Batch is like an art-house version of Mad Max. It's in a dystopian future, has these strange groups of people in the deserts and stuff, it's gory at times...just without dynamics. But hey, you can't really expect an art-house film to be dynamic.This is a beautiful, beautiful looking movie. Seriously, this thing is gorgeously shot and sucks you into this world. But the story fails at sucking you in. It's obviously open to interpretation at times, but when you take it literally, it's really not much of a plot. It has these moments, surprising moments of an actual conversation that seems to set up some themes, but then it's like nothing ever happened. Only if you dig deep enough, but it's not that interesting. I came up with a few theories about metaphors in this movie, so it did interest me a bit, but I really didn't feel like going into details. Aside from the script, everything worked for me. The style, the acting, the pace (even though it's a bit sleazy, I sort of expected that). The director knows how to awaken some emotions with just directing actors and putting us in their head through some scenes.I might watch this again. If you want another strange movie to analyze, this is for you. It's not the best, but it's alright."
" very enjoyable, but expect a weird film
",2017-11-11 00:00:00,10,"A minor criminal is exiled to a fenced off wasteland that used to be part of Texas with all the other undesirables (a la Escape From New York) and is immediately captured by cannibals. After her escape, the only safe place to go is a camp where a sex/drug cult leader is building his paradise and trying to impregnate as many followers as possible. The main character doesn't exactly love this setup either, so she at first goes looking for revenge on the cannibals, but ends up kidnapping the daughter of one of them, and the father comes looking for her.I'm kind of surprised so many people didn't like this. It wasn't billed as a big action sci-fi kind of movie, and it's not. The director, Ana Amirpour, has been compared to Tarantino, but I feel she's the exact opposite of Tarantino. He's all about lots of dialog, skipping around in the story line, very little in the way of visuals, lots of jokes, etc. This is slow paced, very little dialog (almost none really), but it's telling a story in the style usually called ""realism"" where the textures of the world come through. It's a very good soundtrack, great visuals, the director makes full use of sight and sound to tell the story, which I have to say is what cinema, as opposed to books and radio, is all about.It doesn't really have a straightforward plot with a simple conflict or obvious good and bad guys, but the director is not known for those Hollywood style movies at all. She's known for being very unconventional (her other big film was an Iranian vampire western) so just expect that it's going to be a weird film."
" Slow, Minimal Dialogue, Meandering
",2017-11-07 00:00:00,5,"Two of those things were good to see.Arlen is cast away into the desert, branded a member of the bad batch, implying a dystopian society on the outside that locks away it's undesirable members. Unfortunately we don't get to see any of that at all, and the most we get is odd little references dotted about. She's caught by a group of cannibals who cut off and eat her arm and her leg, before she manages to escape. After finding a place named - without subtlety - Comfort, she goes out into the wilderness again to seek revenge on those who took her limbs from her. She finds a kid, has a badly- narrated drug-trip and bumps into ""Miami Man"", a great hulking figure, head of the cannibal settlement, looking for the girl she took to Comfort. The second half of the movie becomes Arlen and Miami Man trying to get the girl back.The story isn't particularly great, I'll be honest. The revenge plot is completely forgotten about in favour of trying to get the girl back. In fact the whole cannibal thing doesn't play too much of a part after the drug trip either. It also never seeks to answer any questions, which is fine, but when the world this all takes place in is far more fascinating than the actual story, the lack of answers becomes frustrating. Where does Comfort get all of its comforts from? Who is The Screamer? Why does no-one kill The Hermit while he's just wandering around the wasteland? If Comfort has access to food and water, why are the Cannibals cannibals? If all of The Dream's women are pregnant, but there are no children, what happens to them? Or has The Dream only been in power for less than nine months? If Comfort has guns and ammo aplenty, why are the Cannibals still alive at all?There are other questions too, that pose more as plot holes than straight-up world building cock-blocks. Like why is Arlen so accepting of Miami Man despite him being responsible for her lost limbs? Why does she willingly help him when she could just go back to Comfort and stay there where he can't get her? And why is there a subtle romance hinted at between them? I mean big props to Momoa and Suki Waterhouse for managing to get across a sense of desire and affection between them without a single word - and I really liked it for that - but narratively it made no sense (or maybe that was the point, hurr hurr).Acting is a mixed bag in all. Suki Waterhouse is at times great and at times awful. The movie's lack of dialogue definitely works in her favour, as she gets to look pretty in the desert in skimpy shorts the whole time. The emotions and feelings she manages to convey without words is good, but as soon as she opens her mouth I couldn't help but cringe. Bad accent, badly delivered, and badly written. Momoa manages to encompass the more brooding side of his musculature quite well, and the chemistry he shares with Waterhouse is commendable for sure. Giovanni Ribisi is criminally underused. He appears about twice, muttering about some ""thing"" that he can't find. That's it. Keanu Reeves gets a potentially tantalising role as The Dream, but it's never capitalised on by the story. Nonetheless what we see of The Dream is a man of wisdom who abuses his power just enough not to be an antagonist. Jim Carrey is unrecognisable. Didn't even realise it was him until well after the movie finished, but his character was definitely one of the biggest highlights of the entire movie, despite not uttering a single word.Stylistically The Bad Batch is a winner through-and-through though. It's a slowly paced movie that prefers to sit in the moment. There's a lot of desert-scape shots, as we watch people walk around the desert (or drive golf carts), but even from the confines of Comfort and the Cannibals there's some interesting cinematography. With dialogue to a minimum, it's down to the cinematography to tell the story, and it does a brilliant job of conveying who's who, what they stand for, and what's going on in the story, and ultimately that's the most important thing for cinematography to get right. It's use of practical effects throughout deserves mention as well. While most the time it can make it feel like a cheap student film, they somehow managed to make the amputation clean and believable without the use of CGI, and for that I only have endless praise.Sonically the movie is really good as well, barring that terribly narrated drug trip. The use of ambient sound really brings the otherwise vacant world to life, from the sound of things to the subtle white noise of the wind. The music is also surprisingly good too. The selection of popular and dance music is an odd mix that somehow works. From the synthwave-influenced Black Light Smoke and Chilled by Nature, to more pop-y Federale and Culture Club, it creates a sonic identity to the movie that makes it stand out and be individually enjoyable as well.The Bad Batch is not a movie for everyone. It's extremely slow-paced, with a story that meanders around aimlessly in order to pretentiously tell us something about the world that we already knew. I saw it described somewhere as like if someone went to Burning Man and thought 'I want to make a movie of that'. It has some great cinematography and some great music, and some surprisingly good acting from the big name stars, but it's not particularly a movie I'd ever opt to see again. I give it a middling 5/10."
" not horror but not bad
",2017-11-04 00:00:00,8,"i love writer/director Ana Lily Amirpour's debut film A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. slow-paced, visually-oriented and highly stylised, it reminds me of the films of Jim Jarmusch. this one, on the other hand, feels more like an homage to Jodorowsky's El Topo. set in a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland, it features all of the driving characteristics of A Girl Walks Home, but with added emphasis on a diverse assortment of characters and relatively sparse but memorable dialogue. i wouldn't necessarily describe it as philosophically profound, but it certainly inspires contemplation the film is categorised as horror on both IMDb and Wikipedia. aside from a brief scene involving cannibalism near the beginning, there's nothing really horrific about this, and viewers expecting there to be will likely be disappointed in that regard. it takes a while to get into; each scene is drawn out to the max, with the camera repeatedly lingering on characters' facial expressions for 5 - 10 second intervals. i'm not good at reading faces, though, and if there was some meaning being conveyed thereby, i had difficulty interpreting it and found it tedious to watchon the whole, it's an enjoyable and thought-provoking film that i look forward to watching again, even if it's a little slower than seems necessary at times and doesn't quite measure up to Amirpour's first effort, in my view"
" Dire
",2017-10-23 00:00:00,2,"Truly dire movie. The first 10 mins are shocking and quite gripping, but after that it loses the plot - only that there is no plot to lose. Seriously, there is nothing in terms of a story. Instead, there are aimless wonderings around the dessert by characters, and long, long shots, and long scenes where very little actually happens. There is no proper dialogue to speak of, and the one conversation that the film has is about sh*t....literally it's about sh*t. How? Why? What was the purpose of this movie? How did anyone actually think this would be a good idea?The only good thing, is the main actress, who is quite cute and watchable."
" Unreal... seriously... Why?
",2017-10-20 00:00:00,1,"OK, first let me say I am a fan off off beat cult type artistic movies. No matter who rates what I will still see it for myself and come up with my own opinion. (I wish I could suggest you do the same here)That all said, this movie is one long drawn out, slow, Lost show style plot (if that), striving to be artistic and moving and... just... doesn't get there... ever... not even close.A friend said I should watch this movie. I want to slap him and never trust anything he says ever again. Usually I would say, a movie has some redeeming qualities some place... this one is totally void of any.So, you probably already read the layout of what happens, so I wont rehash that here. Let me say that I can 100% agree with their reviews. Entirely agree. Someone said there was drama, and murder and all that... yeah... murder yes. Painfully so... but the drama...? And the person who filmed this movie seemed to love focusing the camera needlessly on the rear end of Suki Waterhouse. Not that it's a bad rear end. However, just about every scene is focused there and I almost half waited for the missing dialogue in the film to come out of it... Cast Away was better at limited dialogue than this film by a long shot, say Galaxy wide long shot.Just save yourself the time. If you really want to see it for the train wreck it is, be my guest, but consider yourself warned. It's really really... REALLY boring, slow, pointless and VERY Bad. Seriously bad."
" Tainted, although sparkly in light
",2017-10-18 00:00:00,5,"The Bad Batch refers not to some brown acid but rather to a particular set of ex-convicts, those recently released from a prison in the southwestern US. Each inmate is tattooed with a serial number, which naturally precludes them from gainful, meaningful employment. Good thing that the vast desert right outside the prison's gates is uncharted territory, meaning it's not under the jurisdiction of either the US or Mexico. It just is.Arlen (Suki Waterhouse) is such an ex con. With nowhere else to go, she begins a-wandering across the desert with a jug of water. She finds a rusted-out car and – for some reason – begins to apply her eyeliner using the rear-view mirror. Then a couple of people roar up in a golf cart and abduct her. When she wakes up, she's chained to an airplane door. She gets injected with something – I'm gonna guess a sedative or painkiller – and her abductors lop off her right arm and left leg. And eat them.None of that is a spoiler. It all happens in the first twenty minutes or so. Our heroine does quickly escape and finds a place called Comfort, which is basically a continuous rave. Comfort is run by The Dream (Keanu Reeves, delivering a particularly wooden performance), and everyone there is part of the Bad Batch themselves, the rejects of society.Arlen is out for revenge, so back to the cannibals she goes. There's a lot of her ping-ponging back and forth between the two camps, for various uninteresting reasons. But this isn't a standard revenge movie – it's much more confounding and pointless. I can get behind a good old fashioned revenge flick, but this is just dopey nonsense. You know things are out of wack when you kind of root for the main cannibal (Jason Momoa). And when the best performance in the movie, by a long shot, is by Jim Carrey as a grizzled hermit – who never speaks a word.The Bad Batch looks pretty and might even have a genesis for a cool movie within it somewhere, but it's a major dud. It's also very violent, so you have plenty of gore to look forward to. And lastly, Arlen's lopped-off limbs are on full display (not hiding behind bulky clothes), and apparently this was accomplished without resorting to digital erasure of her real arm and leg. So that's a positive. Not much else is."
" Not to sure what I watched
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,1,"I don't think this is a spoiler. What was the point of the making of this movie? I made it through the whole movie only because I fast forwarded the gruesome parts. I think the only thing I ""liked"" about this film was involving the little girl and the determination of Arlen. My heart sank for Arlen and everything she faced."
" Burning Man meats (heehee) the Flintstones
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,10,"Dark Comedy! Too bad Kubrick isn't around for this one. What can you say maybe impermanence meets survival.I have seen many movies with a much larger body count, more blood and gore but this is art and art makes you squirm or at least it should.This will become a cult classic along with Night of the Living Dead. Someone needs to put a plaque where this one was made. Good Work Just watch and listen. No right and no wrong there is just life as is"
" Good opening, then limps to nowhere
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,1,"Jim Carrey is uncredited. I wondered why. Then I watched the movie.Thing is, I watched the first 20 minutes, then put it aside, thinking that my wife's sister's family, who are fans of edgy cinema and were soon to visit us, would be down for an aprés apocalypse mindfock like this.They, like me, enjoyed the first 20 minutes. Hardly any dialogue (in a good way), some nice directorial flourishes, a more than adequate set up. Lots of promise. A good skeleton on which to put some meat.A young woman is banished to a lawless territory in the desert, is kidnapped by what turns out to be a community of iron-pumping cannibals, has an arm and a leg amputated (and her wounds cauterized, presumably so that the rest of her can also be eaten or, you know, otherwise put to use), then manages to free herself and find her way to a place called Comfort where the people eat noodles and chicken instead.I assumed what would follow would be a story of revenge and rescue, the goodies of Comfort taking down the baddies at the Venice Beach barbecue, maybe with some explanation as to how the people of Comfort get access to gasoline, photocopiers, rice noodles and all the recreational pharma you could hope for. (My guess was that there would be some connection to a group outside the lawless land, perhaps some sort of probably not-so-kosher arrangement between Keanu Reeves's Jim Jones knockoff and his inworld suppliers.)No answers came. None.Despite a severe underbite, Jim Carrey managed to chew what little scenery there was and he was still the best thing in the film by a long walk. The moment he hands Momoa a snowglobe was when I knew I wasn't coming back. The movie had left me in my own offworld without a clue where I was going or what would happen to me when I got there.Loooong story short, the girl falls in love with Momoa's Atkins aficionado after eating some Guatemalan insanity peppers and tripping out like she ate a bad oatmeal cookie at a Grateful Dead concert.There's some other stuff. A kid who likes spaghetti elbows more than actual elbows and who cries when her Daddy and her new stepmom eat her pet rabbit; a homeless philosopher dude played by Ribisi, channeling an amalgam of all those fidgety weirdos that Brad Pitt used to play; and almost no dialogue not spoken by Reeves, whose explanation of where his dookie go goes on for about nine minutes.But it is bad enough to be a fun watch with friends who like movies made without scripts by people who can't make a movie without a script. Which is most people.Seriously, I want to know the backstory to this debacle. My guess: Super-talented young director makes great movie, gets noticed, then gets one of those bags with the two dollar signs on it and access to Harvey Weinstein's rolodex while he's in the bath. But the movie has to be made in 10 days because Jim has a showing of his larger canvases at a gallery where people will hand him bags with two dollar signs on them because he's Jim Carrey, not because he's actually a talented sculptor and painter.Or Jim shook the snowglobe and handed it to the director, saying (with only his eyes), ""Before the snow has settled within, the script must be written."""
" Philosophical view toward society.
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,10,"The movie attempts to drive home a lot of transparencies that societies provide with safety and comfort and can become a detraction to life. The bad batch consist of individuals who where labeled unfit for society and released into an open unlawful land. It was refreshing to see Arlen reject the area called ""Comfort"" and continue to wonder the desert. The man called ""The Dream"" said Arlen was a sailboat at sea without any wind because she was not happy at ""Comfort"". Essentially, death and survival was more probable than behind the walls of ""Comfort"". The wide open of nothing. But, the individuals labeled the ""Bridge People"" appeared to have a different perspective than the ""Comfort People"".I watched the movie twice. Not because of entertainment purposes, but because it reminds me of the illusions that the American society has created. If everything was stripped away, no food, clothing, or shelter....then the reptilian brain wakes up and survival instincts are re-enabled. Each day would consist of finding food and survival."

Perfect seasoning, I'll wait anxiously for the next movie from this director.Jim Carey was stunning, jason momoa, suki and the rest of the cast were just perfect. A movie to really enjoy and it will keep you up all the movie."
" Munchies Anyone?
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,2,"VICE TV had a hand in this which fit nicely with their alternative tele clientele. Nothing was believable in this film beginning with a girl walking across a Texas desert with about a half gallon water, really cut off shorts and a tank top (she did have a hat). Next we have a not explained well, if at all, two different nearby walled in communities in the desert at odds with each other. One likes to capture people and cut off limbs to munch on (while still keeping what remains of them alive) the other likes to drug their members. So our female stroller gets captured and loses a couple of limbs to the one group, but escapes to the other then returns to the first group of munchers. Stupid and pointless and a waste of viewing time. Was there a theme about humanity - only if you're a cannibal."
" It so desperately wants to be cool, but continuously misses the mark.
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,4,"I'm very liberal when it comes to rating movies. Not everything can be ""The Usual Suspects"" - I understand that.Holy crap, does this thing drag on and, man, is it trying desperately to be hip, edgy, cool, or something.

" Tries hard to be deep, ends up being just edgy
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,4,"Let's start by saying that I'm usually a good public for this kind of slow paced, contemplative movies. That is, as long as there's something beneath the surface. And here's where The Bad Batch pretty much fails : it doesn't have much to say, and tries to hide it behind a few vague and pseudo-philosophical dialogues and nice images (one redeeming quality of the film is its photography, the other being the soundtrack). The symbols and references keep flowing through the entire movie, but they're always so shallow or obvious that they don't hit their goal. At the end, all that's left is a visually nice, artsy movie with no substance and a few known actors lost in the middle. In other words, a waste of the spectator's time."
" Dreadful stuff
",2017-10-03 00:00:00,4,"I went against my instincts when it came to watching 'The Bad Batch'. Every nerve in my body was telling me it would be dreadful, but the words cannibals, Jim Carrey, Keanu Reeves and Giovanni Ribisi kept repeating over and over in my head until I finally gave in and made the fateful mistake of watching it. My god, how is it possible to make a story this boring out of cannibals? Every single thing it tries to make itself interesting with completely falls flat. When you manage to get a completely dull and forgettable performance out of Jim Carrey you know you're doing something terribly wrong.The film tries to be thought-provoking (at least it seemed like that was what it was going for) but none of the concepts it presents are in any way actually worthy of a second thought. It also goes for a lot of style, however it again falls short. In a futuristic desert wasteland setting there a thousand different concepts you could use to create an interesting story. For some reason 'The Bad Batch' chooses a story that could have been told in any setting and in any time period. That's about as lazy as story-telling gets. If you do make the mistake of selecting this one up on Netflix brace yourself for a long and painful couple of hours."
" A movie for people who love (real) Cinema
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,6,"This is a really beautiful film and - most importantly - it's real, actual, solid cinema as opposed to the tons of commercial, repetitive, mainstream crap we're (unfortunately) flooded with. This review could end here, because it's something you have to see for yourself.There's a caveat, though: as for every real movie, ""The Bad Batch"" requires you to have the SKILL of watching a film. You have to work *with* the movie in order to enjoy it, which means your brain must be ON. If you are the kind of viewer who thinks movies should be mindless entertainment to switch your mind off for a couple hours, who needs to be guided through a story, hand-holded by expositional dialogue and stereotyped characters, then I strongly suggest you turn to something different: the Fast & Furious franchise, or Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie #17 may be a more apt choice, for you.Here you'll find strong acting performances, a beautifully crafted narrative that relies on visuals way more than on dialogues, a great soundtrack, a chiseled editing and lots and lots of great small moments, ranging from horrifying to dramatic, from comedic to romantic, from bitterly satiric to endearingly sweet.It's a great cinematic experience all around which, as cherry on top, also has something to say about the world we live in. So do yourself a favor, watch it, and decide for yourself if you like it or don't :-)"
" What if we let today's world run unopposed ...?
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,6,"The Bad Batch isn't a bad film at all, it just doesn't follow the basic principle of introducing characters, introducing plot, solving plot with a twist here and there, happy end. It reminded me a lot of Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof"", which took AGES to tell you what its actually about.The Bad Batch just lets the story run its course, like its a living being itself.At times, this means you wish for some more context or dialog, hence the 6 stars only, but mostly this film is an outlook of the tomorrow world IF we let today's world run unopposed. Politicans and media love to talk about the split society of the rich and powerful trying to sideline the rest. The Bad Batch gives us a glimpse of how this could (would?) end, with a pinch of terribly dark humor.For that, and the surprisingly high level cast, its well worth watching."
" Wut?!
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,1,"Wow, where do I begin? The first 20 minutes or so were promising but then the movie starts to fail fast and never recovers. I only watched it because of Keanu but right now Keanu you've betrayed me man, it's a total mess of a movie. It seems like it desperately wants to be Mad Max with a touch of Beauty and the Beast, and most definitely it wants to be seen as a ""cult classic"" but it never will be. The whole movie could have been done in 20 - 30 minutes. Take the first part of the movie, up to where she does that thing that causes Jason Momoa to come looking for her, delete the rest...The End..that would have been a great movie. The acting skills seem off, the lead actress has the personality of a tissue, no one really seems to sound convincing when they deliver their lines, if they even have lines because there really isn't that much dialogue, which would be fine but they don't convey anything via body language or facial expressions either...I didn't care about any of the characters..well maybe the little girl but even then not really....the only good thing about this movie was Jason Momoas gorgeous physique. Just film that dude for a couple hours, walking round the desert without the pretend story line and it would be loads better than this movie."

Now back to Acid Trip,Mad Max is now replaced by girl power blonde millennial wandering the wasteland of Tatooine or Las Vegas ...doesn't matter where. The endless desert vistas makes any loony story interesting...for a while.The cute heroine seeks revenge for trailer trash cannibals capturing & then amputating her right arm & left leg after being dropped off in the Forbidden Zone by Homeland Security. After escaping on a skateboard,rolling herself along a dry lake (story jumps the rails ) she is brought to Bartertown...heals her stumps while lethargically watching Bartertown's Hipsters gather near the courthouse waiting for mayor (Keanu Reeves) to host another nightly rave party (just like from the Matrix trilogy) Latter she wonders off,meets GQ cannibal , falls in Love with the beefcake meat-head that ate half of her six months previously ...why? Low self esteem is what I figure,the oiled down hunk meat-head is a good father to his mute 9 year old biracial daughter (points) draws pretty birds (points) & has awesome prison pecs,tats & sensitivity (points points points)But beefcake is a cannibal after all so it's not perfect (minus points for gnawing on bone marrow ) But for stumpy it's a marriage made in heaven.The Cameo of the homeless bum Jim Carrey tooling around with his shopping cart is stolen straight out of 'The Road' with Viggo Mortensen ...the plagiarism ruins deep ...actually allot is stolen from The Road,Mad Max & others of the Doomsday genre. The long drawn out scenes of fading B character actors tripping on a cocktail of Ecstasy & Ego (that's you Carrey & Keanu ) while wandering the Mohave sound-stage is bizarre .I missed seeing the deeper meanings while fast forwarding to the end. Please bury this latest Bad Batch under the desert floor."
" A true ""MUST-SEE"" Movie!
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,2,"I STRONGLY recommend everyone watch this. Is it good? No. Is it coherent? Hah! Is it the worst movie ever? Quite possibly.So why would I recommend anyone watch this steaming pile of incoherent garbage? To come back and read the IMDb reviews after.There's something cathartic about seeing the immense anger of all the other poor viewers who survived this experience. Their frustration, their rage, their inability to comprehend the world any longer... after you watch this ""movie,"" you too will understand that sensation. And it is truly uniting.... but from the perspective of a good use of time, no, don't watch this. It has no plot, horrible acting, and dialogue written by (and likely for) a 4 year old. It did have one incredible accomplishment though - the director managed to turn $6 million into $100,000 box office gross. So it has that going for it."
" Details... A bit more definition to story would have elevated it greatly.
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,3,"This review contains a small spoiler. The script was weak and without clear center. Coupled with the direction, It lacked a clarity of what if any the desert society's moral or ethical base base might be. Given that the environment is a part of the story, I felt it was under emphasized. The direction and shooting of the main characters emotional content was good, The directer did establish 'connection' with the characters. I felt the interplay of the characters themselves could have been better. I attribute that the the script. Suki Waterhouse did a great job for the material she had, i.e. words put in her mouth, or lack thereof. She was very good given the limitation of a less than developed script. She displayed the subtext of emotion well. But a few words more would have elevated the part. Jason Mamoa,I thought did a first rate job. He is very adept as the dangerous giant, who even as he carries an aura of death, silently so beautifully conveys complex and deep emotion, even compassion. Keanu Reeves played the philosophic opportunist who rationalizes his existence and flexible morality with an air of caring, yet a deceptively dangerous indifference.One flaw sticks out. Alert, this may be a spoiler. There is a scene where three characters sit around a fire cooking and eating the evening meal. The fire ring, is common to all of us. Some stones stacked in a circle ring, and the fire burns within. What is wrong with that? Well, they were sitting in the mid of what appeared to be a salt flat, or dry lake. Flat for hundreds of yards. No foliage close, no wood. Jason Mamoa, a girl with one arm, and a kid? Who will carry wood for a fire, and gather heavy stones? Sitting in mid dry flat, not a sprig within reach? Nope."
" I have a hard time with this....
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,6,"This film is an interesting lot. In a many respects, I want to dislike it. I want to vote it down, because I feel it was truly made to waste two hours of a person's life. It has a thinly constructed main plot line that never really goes anywhere and lacks the investment of time in character details that could have made the development of the overall film, much more interesting. The great thing about this movie? I fell asleep three times during it, and stayed asleep each time! Nor did I have much trouble going back to it either. I was literally that invested in the cinematic tapestry, and subtle hints of deeper story just waiting to be scratched. The film is quiet, surreal, and in many cases intricate and interesting, even if it lacks a central story arc worth the overall investment. And the fact that you can sleep to it? Not many films can offer that sort of peaceful bliss."
" Just like a bad batch of scones, this one isn't worth the eating.
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,3,"Pretentious rubbish. Pacing is terrible, story is almost non existent, and the dialogue (when it does happen) is average at best.This feels like a series of stylistically beautiful visuals (which is why I gave it a 3 and not a 0) strung together, almost like a big budget film school project, but without any storytelling substance to tie it all together and make it something good.I really get the sense that she's watched a lot of Tarantino films, and then tried to make one of her own without actually understanding what it is that makes a Tarantino film so good."
" Religious plot?
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,6,"SPOILER ALERT! I would like to know if anyone have seen the symbolic meaning of the movie. Is this movie speaking about EDEN, the beautiful Confort garden told in the holy bible? For me the analogy is pretty clear and obvious. Brave concept, pity that has been realized in a poor way. Except for the photography that has nice shots."
" No spoiler as there is no scenario
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,1,One star for the scenery other than it's just a bunch of has been stars wandering around like the scenario of this movie. Boo to you Vice/no- brainers/ Hipsters from BKLYN : give me back these 1 hour 59 minutes you took from me. Even my cat is more entertaining.
" Mad Max 1 and 2 were very good. The Book of Eli was not bad. This movie....
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,2,"I tried to like this movie in Netflix. I stopped it.. washed the dog... returned...nope, still bad. Two cups of coffee did not improve it, I found myself surfing in Facebook while movie was playing and sometimes looked at it to see where the wandering girl with fake fake leg is. I'm the kind of person who eats gummy bears in pairs just so one does not die alone... this movie caused the unnecessary deaths of countless gummy bears! Oh my.... Carnivale (series) this is not! The plot is so weak and the story? so linear. Girl walks around in desert, no sex, arm n leg cut off, more walking, movie ends. I gave it a 2 because the filming was good in wide screen :)"
" So Many WTFs, So Little Time
",2017-09-28 00:00:00,2,"So many issues here. Apparently you can wander around in the desert for hours (days?) and not even get a touch of sunburn (literally the first line in the movie is 'It's hotter than Satan's a-hole out here'), yet no sunburn. Or ride motorcycles in the desert with no eye protection and not even squint in the closeup.Then there's the Muscle Beach Cannibal Compound (I thought the movie had gone to commercial when the scene started, it's so silly and out of place).Could have been a decent flick. Does not deliver."
" A total waste of time
",2017-09-28 00:00:00,1,Jim Carrey's not credited . For sure he knew it was a disaster movie. Keanu what a mess . How did you dare to corrupt your reputation . Ribisy HE DEFINITELY DESERVED THE MOVIE. HE'S A WASTED. HE IMPOSES HIMSELF TO Hollywood.can't imagine working with lots of top celebs in Hollywood and he's got nothing to say.Any way this is the worst movie I saw recently.what a waste of time and money
" Whitetrash girl meets a HavanaHunk
",2017-09-28 00:00:00,3,"Movie offers an interesting survival state setting with a very AESTHETIC perception of it. But you can't expect me to be interested in it for 2 hours just because there is a good looking young female head actress and a human flesh eating Havana body builder. Bad Batch has no meaningful story or dialogue what so ever all tho it gives us glimpses of semi interesting characters and groups. Just shows the mindlessness of the writer, movie is just a one big boring lump of teasing."
" Trippy & Original!
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,6,"Writer-Director Ana Lily Amirpour's 'The Bad Batch' is quite a ride! Trippy & Original, this romantic black comedy horror-thriller flick, is intentionally slow-paced & has very less dialogue to speak of, and while its never compelling enough to be called a must see, it still has its own strange mood that is appealing for the most part.'The Bad Batch' Synopsis: A love story set in a community of cannibals in a Future Dystopia. In a desert wasteland in Texas, a muscled cannibal breaks one important rule: don't play with your food.'The Bad Batch' is a story on survival at the end of nowhere. The world here is shown as broken, deserted & horrifically violent. Its a world where cannibalism rules, its a world where people are near danger at all times & survival is their first priority. Its all dry, dusted & dirty!Ana Lily Amirpour's Screenplay is comfortably slow-paced & delivers a story that will only cater to a niche audience. The mood & the atmosphere of this story, is certainly not meant for all. I, however, found myself interested in this story for a good part of it. And while the film is overlong at nearly 2 hours, the narrative never gets unbearable. Its thoroughly watchable & extremely well-shot. Ana Lily Amirpour's Direction deserves brownie points. She has Directed the film with a vision of her own & remains true to the subject matter all through. Lyle Vincent's Cinematography is excellent & captures the cannibalistic world, most effectively. Alex O'Flinn's Editing needed to be sharper. Though crisp in parts, the film needed to be trimmed by at least 15-minutes. Art & Costume Design are brilliantly done. And 'The Bad Batch' features a killer soundtrack, featuring some smashing tracks from the yesteryear's.Performance-Wise: Suki Waterhouse is superb in a star-making performance. As the protagonist with a lost hand, Waterhouse is sexy & arresting in her portrayal. Jason Momoa uses his buffed up body to do most of the talking. Keanu Reeves as the Dream, a manipulative cult-leader, is at his relaxed best. Jim Carrey as the mute & lanky Hermit is outstanding. Giovanni Ribisi as the mentally damaged Bobby, leaves a strong impression.On the whole, 'The Bad Batch' isn't bad nor is it great. Its somewhere between good to above-average."
" Still not sure what to think of it...not in a great way.
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,4,"In the first 10 minutes of the movie, I'm getting a Mad Max meets Kill Bill vibe...only for that hope to completely dissipate in the following 20-30 minutes. A silent film has more outstanding dialogue than this movie did. I was fascinated by the characters..until they opened their mouths (which wasn't even that often). I mean...I REALLY think there were less than 800 words total in this movie. I was digging the ""hey, we're gonna just place you in the middle of this story...and you can figure it out"" kind of approach, but...I was left questioning SO many things by the time credits rolled. If you want to watch an ""artsy"" flick, with absolutely no substance to it...sure...go ahead. I understand Jason Mamoa is eye-candy, and Keanu is Keanu... I just wonder how proud of the completed film they are."
" Strange movie, has it's moments. A few tweaks to story-line would improve it.
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,6,"This appears to be a movie about a future where members of the prison population are cast out into a apocalyptic desert wasteland. There are two settlements in the movie, a set of cannibals who I guess are the bad guys (sort of) and a settlement of non-cannibals who appear to have a more moral stance in terms of not eating people, offering a bit of help to those in need and not casting people out for being extremely odd. There are a few nods to what actually transpired/is transpiring but nothing concrete. **spoiler alert** At the end of the film the main character appears to opt to choose to live with a cannibal who ate some of her limbs rather than staying in the relatively safe haven apparently controlled by cultish leader ""The Dream"". Not really sure how much logical sense this makes as in the non cannibal settlement they have have Uzis's and other weapons along with an heir of civility and certainly no one brutally sawing limbs off living human beings which are then cooked and eaten. But each to their own I guess.There are certainly areas of this story which could have been explained better, there are sections of the film that drag on a little whereas there are sections that simply skip large time periods in which more light could have been shed on what is actually going on. This may well be deliberate and certainly gives scope for the viewer to use their own imagination to construct large areas of the plot in their own mind, it's debatable whether or not this is a good thing.In summary - This is not a terrible film nor is it a finished masterpiece. If one can get through some horrific scenes and isn't expecting too much it's probably worth a watch, it has it's moments of brilliance and no shortage of sections that will one would expect to draw a large amount of criticism."
" What i think
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,10,Awesome film & acting by all cast - Suki was fantastic & such a natural beauty throughout. Her acting is intense & deep & Suki is well suited to this role. Keanu was himself as always & played the part well as always. So a great film & interesting story line & it is like the beauty breaks the Beast when she finally gets close to Miami Man Jason Momoa. The filming looked so 'complete' when Arlen was filmed with no leg & no arm - very clever filming!. Such a Retro film that it made it a classic.
" Unimaginably bad
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,1,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen at least half of. I feel like this film was ported from the wilds of the mid-90s, when this kind of kitschy post- apocalyptic setting was used as an excuse for dozens, if not hundreds, of lets-be-very-generous- and-call-them passion projects, where someone figured that if they put enough neat people in a dusty frame, and gave them nothing to say, some sensation of meaning would magically appear. It worked no better in this than it did then. This movie makes The Six-String Samurai look like a classic. Why cast Momoa as an insultingly stereotyped Mexican? Why not have, I don't know, a plot? The lead is set adrift with nothing to do, say, or be - except sort of...erotically disabled? Was that what the director was aiming for? This is a confusing and upsetting film, and I don't know how it was allowed to carry on for as long as it did without someone trying to fix it."
" Some interesting moments, but overall incredibly lacking
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,2,"The Bad Batch is a bizarre, sometimes fascinating, but mostly dreadfully glacial, try hard artsy film. The main problem with it is that it confuses silence and a plodding pace for depth, and despite some unique moments, it's really not worth your time. The story is actually a fairly interesting one, something that you could see in a Mad-Max type of film, but unfortunately the premise is mostly squandered on shots of empty expanse and our main character, the lifeless Suki Waterhouse, staring dead eyed, either sober or on hallucigenic drugs from Keanu Reeves. If she had given a better performance I might have cut this film some more slack, but in this movie she has about as much personality as a piece of plain white bread (which is also a good metaphor for the movie as a whole). It's there, it serves it's purpose, but its ultimately forgettable and bland. With actors like Keanu Reeves and Jim Carrey, I'm surprised that the director chose this actress for the lead. Even Jason Momoa gives a middling performance. Keanu is hard not to love in everything, but his role could be played by pretty much anybody else. Jim Carrey doesn't say a word.To resist the urge to rip this movie to shreds, I'll say that the scenes between Momoa and Waterhouse are the highest point in the movie. My favorite scene in the entire movie is where they hide from a sandstorm. It only lasts a couple of seconds but it's one of the only moments in the movie where you actually feel a connection between two human beings. Ultimately, under a better or more talented director and with a more likable lead this movie could have been something, but as it stands it's a mostly lifeless shell of something that could have been decent, with a couple of interesting moments thrown in. I wouldn't recommend seeing it, for art house fans or not. It's just not a good movie."
" Human Stew Factory Products?!

" One of the most tedious big budget movie ever!
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,1,"I watched this film today on Netflix. I was surprised when I found this title on Netflix this soon, I guess Netflix got the right to release this at the same time as its DVD release. That is usually not a good sign... however, I took a chance because I had been excited to see this movie since last year because it's got great casts, and a promising plot directed by one of the most anticipated foreign female directors, sounds like a good catch...but,It's a big fat MESS!!! Boring, tedious, lengthy are the perfect words to describe this movie. I am so glad that I watched on Netflix because I could fast-forward some scenes. I couldn't help it, it was painfully uninteresting!! Like other reviewers are saying, nothing really happens in this overlong approx. 2hrs movie. Too many unnecessary landscape shots, too many meaningless walking scenes, minimal dialog (probably I can easily memorize the entire script), unrealistic supplies of resource, lack of character developments, no explanation of characters' intentions etc...etc...I don't even know when and why the main girl (A watered down version of Miley Cirus, IMO) fell in love with Jason Momoa's character! Stockholm syndrome of some sort??? Pretty much all of her actions are questionable. In the beginning of the movie, her priority should've been finding her own safety in this lawless territory and seeking a water supply, instead she chose to put on a lipstick in the very dry desert where no one is around. I immediately disliked her for that reason.Although there is so many tedious scenes, the part where she grew feelings for Miami Man (Momoa) is shorter than the blink of an eye. Even Miami Man seems confused by her action at close to the end scene (where 90% of dialog takes place), and her answer is just nonsense. Moreover, her southern accent was utterly unbearable more than Momoa's Cuban accent. Why not avoid using British actress if she is that terrible. The other 10% of dialog happens in the scene where Keanu explains how important to grow tomato right. The acting of Ski Waterhouse especially her facial expressions in this scene is purely awful. It's actually astonishing, can't help wondering how she got this roll.I can go on and on, but I don't wanna make my review lengthy like this movie.The only things worth watching were Jim Carry's portrayal of sympathetic scavenger (he gave me a good laugh, too) and Keanu Reeves's 70s' porn star like looks exclusively in this movie!!"
" Awful, pretentious, wasteful
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,1,"I'm not even going to bother talking about the supposed story here, as there was none. I just want to point out that not once did I feel interested in any visual, any actor nor did I care one bit about the lead character which was a girl in an impossible place for a female in the real world (she would have been killed/raped long ago) so the whole movie is just ridiculous, boring, for lack of a better term, and EXTREMELY pretentious film-making and editing. Someone else said it's ""trying desperately to be cool"" and it fails 100%"
" Film without a point? Couldn't finish.
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,2,"What can I say about a film I only watched the first quarter of? It's not my habit to stop a film once I've started watching. With this one, I hit the 30-minute mark and the film was just plodding along. I didn't have the impression that anything important had happened. Don't get me wrong: events had occurred but it didn't feel like there was any weight to any of them. To illustrate my point I've transcribed the beginning of the film. For the above reason you don't need to worry about spoilers.We're in the middle of the desert, middle of nowhere. A fence runs through it. A voice narrates something about a ""bad batch"" as two police officers lead a young girl through a gate in the fence and lock up after her. A sign tells us that this is Texas and beyond the fence she's no longer a citizen of the USA and doesn't enjoy any rights. She stares gormlessly after the police car as it leaves. Next scene: she eats her rations. Next scene: she starts walking, even does a little dance and basically seems completely unfazed by her situation. Next scene: she finds a car and sits in it. Not because she feels hot and wants to get out of the sun, not because she wants to try and start it up and have a means of transportation, not because she intends to loot the car, she just sits in it - and applies some make-up. A golf cart comes into view behind her, draws nearer, she notices it but doesn't display any reaction. Next scene: she's running for her life away from the golf cart until one of the occupants pounces on her.I hope I'm getting across the point that even in these first few minutes our main character does stuff but not because she displays any motivation but just because the script seems to call for them. And this goes on and is also true of the other characters. I found it infuriating to watch a movie in which the characters just do meaningless stuff or stare gormlessly into the middle distance. By the 30-minute mark the movie had failed to properly establish the setting, the characters and the plot. It also took until roughly that time for any spoken dialogue to come up - that wasn't grunting or screaming.I think I know what they were going for: bleak, grim and brooding. And that didn't work because a) they would have needed to establish some contrast, otherwise it's just bleak against bleak. b) it's hard to come off as bleak when the characters have food, water, shelter, firearms with ammunition, electricity, some form of medical care, body lotion (some guys seem oiled up like it's Mr. Universe) and even entertainment. Since the film makers were obviously going for something like Mad Max or Escape from New York they should have checked out how messed up characters in those movie were - with all their gear cobbled together from spare parts. You could see plainly that they were living in harsh conditions. c) if they were going for brooding and grim they should show the violence and have characters react to it appropriately. Our leading lady doesn't seem traumatised enough considering she should be far from used to the kinds of things that happen to her.I stopped watching after about the first quarter because I couldn't see the film going anywhere. It was scene after scene of tracking shots of people walking or close-ups of people staring silently. In better films such techniques might have been used for pacing or building atmosphere but here they only come across as pretentious. Maybe I stopped watching before the film gets good but somehow I doubt it and I also don't really care. If the film can't seem to make an effort to engage my interest why should I continue watching it?"
" An intense and gripping post apocalyptic story
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,6,"The pace of the movie is very slow and that is why i think most people didn't like it.I personally enjoyed it, it's tense, original and strange in its own style.You don't get a satisfying payback from the story, but once again Armipour puts her unique style over substance and delivers well enough one more time. In a post apocalyptic genre which is already very explored in cinema, it was original enough for me.Slow paced but intriguing movie with some famous and almost unrecognizable actors."
" What happen when you abandoned art, just to be cool?
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,1,"The true answer to that question can be summaries in a several sequel, or you can just try to watch this ""movie"". When this movie came out, I truly recognize a great new sci-fi franchise, something like Orwell's ""1984"" theme, my concerns that VICE product this movie was left somewhere in my back head. I was so excited about this movie. We didn't have a proper, the world is desert, movie for some time, I mean if you don't count Mad Max: Furry road from 2016. But, this is true, when ever you left your concerns somewhere in the back of the head, they often cam and bite you on your ass. Expectation - HIGH Realistic - Fu.... VICEIdea was there, idea was abandoned, they thought that is enough just to be cool. To be honest, the whole vibe is kinda weird, and it is not repulsive, it is interesting. But that is that. Characters are non existed, the story is non existed. I expected to be some how documentary narration, but it isn't. It is just bunch of long sequel scenes without any dialogue, and with youth alternative music, to say like that. In other words, the are just trying to be cool, to have that street modern ""we are fu..ed and free vibe"". The whole concept of movie preparation remanded me on Gaspar Noe 2015 movie ""Love"", which is just little more artsy porn, when he say ""The script was on two pages"", and that say a lot about movie. The same is here. Ana Lily Amirpour, didn't provide us anything with this move, she just make a very bad narration in that huge wish to be good. When this things happen, and when fun of work is changed with ""This will be the best thing ever"", often things go south, like here, deep south."
" Good beginning, then down dull drama hill.
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,4,"Oh boy, had I the wrong impression of this movie! I thought this was gonna be some sort of comedy-horror thing.. NOPE. I realize I was stupid to think that, but hey.So, it actually starts off pretty good. There is some real tension in the beginning. I was like, yeah, this is gonna be awesome! But man is it down hill from there. After the first minutes, it goes into drama mode and stays there. It does have some qualities, a couple of cool little details that I really liked. But I'm sorry to say, it was a tad boring. Movies are not supposed to be boring, so that's no good.I don't think it had to be so long, almost 2 hours. You could easily shave off about 15-20 minutes. I think this movie tries to be a little artsy. Which it does with long, long scenes, often without dialogue, that drags out, and when they're done you're like.. OK, what was the point of that? Some people like that kind of stuff, but I'm not one of those people.You would think this was a premise you could do some really cool stuff with, but most of it is wasted. It's just drama. Drama drama drama. And some sand. And of course Aquamans pecs, they are great.There is some trickery with a character that loses an arm, and goes the rest of the movie with one arm. It looks OK for the most part, but since they don't use CGI primarily, the character doesn't move it's arm, and you see something is off. Had they used CGI in stead, it would probably look a lot better. Goes to show that practical effects aren't always best. At all. (Probably has something to do with the budget too though, but if you can't afford to have the effects needed, just rewrite the script dammit) Just every scene, basically, the arm is just plastered to the side of the torso, not moving, and I'm pretty sure people missing an arm, don't walk around like that.But yeah, all in all it was just too dull. Some of the characters aren't likable at all, actually that goes for most of the characters I'd say. We get some scenes of violence, but those are too few, and not that exciting either. The ending is also kind of annoying, and really dull."
" Just pretend that Keanu Reeves is not in this movie and it is great.
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,10,"Very underrated movie. The picture, story, actors, makeup, details, music etc. everything deserves a lot more than today's rating(5,5). Watch it for yourself. The only obvious drawback is Keanu Reeves who suck not because he does a bad job, but because he is Keanu Reeves. He does not fit in, all the other character does more or less."
" Did they spend all the money on getting actors and could pay a scriptwriter?
",2017-09-20 00:00:00,2,"No exaggeration 90% of this movie is people walking in silence, staring in silence or sitting in silence.It's excruciating.It's grind house trying to be ""arty"" and failing at both in the process."
" A fascinating look at human nature. A sleeper, to be sure!
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,10,"It's so difficult to find a truly unique film that surprises you. I don't own a television, so seeing movie promos for upcoming films is rare for me. Only by Googling sci-fi films did I stumble upon this one in someone's movie list. I'm so happy that I did! All I saw was that it was a futuristic film with cannibals in it...that was all I needed to see! I absolutely love to be surprised! And this one is a treasure! Each character was played wonderfully. I had no issue suspending disbelief. This must have been a project for the love it. I'm guessing by Keanu's work, these non mainstream shows are a passion for him, much like A Scanner Darkly. I loved that one, as well. I had no idea who would be in it and am always thrilled to see such phenomenal actors take on obscure roles. The Hermit's teeth were truly nasty! Well done on the costumes and effects. If you go through the movie and know that there's something familiar about a particular character but you just can't pinpoint it...that means the actor is doing a brilliant job...because you have no idea that it was someone notable until the credits roll. Jim Carrey was great! Giovanni Ribisi, though recognizable, did a great job being the local crackpot. Not a huge role, but he did it very well. Again, I think this was a project that they must have done for the love of it. I'll be looking at Ana Lily Amirpour's work more now. The story was fantastic. Granted, I would liked to have known a bit more back story, but that's what my imagination is for. The best films keep you thinking. I like Jason Momoa, as well. Seeing his softer expressions, like when he admitted he was lost, was tender and amazing. I don't go for the burly man dripping in muscle, but it suits him. It actually makes the vulnerability that he shows even more beautiful. Suki Waterhouse did a fine job in her role. Though I would liked to have seen a bit more variety in her emotions, however, her character would have to be tough to survive. You don't survive if you are weak. But still, a little more from her would have been nice, especially during the removal of limbs. The music choices were hysterical. The enormous muscle man on the scooter in search of his daughter, priceless! The matter of fact attitude they had to eating people as a means to survive, was interesting. It makes one think of what it, indeed, is like in that situation. It has happened in reality, it may happen again, who knows. Overall, a magnificent piece of work from everyone involved. This must have been a fun show to work on."
" Interesting setting that wasn't taken anywhere
",2017-09-01 00:00:00,5,"The setting and setup of the movie was interesting, and had potential to go somewhere. However, that didn't happen. Some big actors in the movie, but generally their performances weren't great, but its not like they had much to work with. The main character was terrible. She was extremely uninteresting--in fact, usually the opposite of interesting. Her acting was often questionable. In the movie, she had some pretty cringy scenes. However, it could be argued that that was reflective of the terrible character she was playing. The movie seemed to devolve into getting cheap ""entertainment"" off of gore scenes, to make up for not much really happening in the movie. If you are into weird movies that have some interesting concepts, and have some patience, I'd say the first half is worth watching, but go in with low expectations."
" So much going for it - but painfully slow
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,5,"This is a dystopian movie about a young woman left out in a lawless desert with some real choice characters. This film starts off very brutally but calms down considerably after the first few scenes.The characters, acting, production and filming are really good. The story is adequate for needs. The scenery and leading lady are absolutely gorgeous.So why the low score? The pace of this film is cripplingly slow. There are tedious scenes that should be time lapsed but are run in real time, there is lots of staring and grimacing in silence. You really can go and make yourself a sandwich during this and be safe in the knowledge that you are unlikely to miss anything.A lot of potential, I really wanted to like this, but it is just so slow I was fighting to stay awake."
" Great idea... sexist and racist performance
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,2,"It was sad to see a great idea turned into a bad movie. Sexist, racist and, definitely, not a romantic movie. If you're going to show people from Spanish speaking countries, please hire Spanish speaking people. I'm bored with Latin equal bad versus U.S. equals good... or equivalents. Women equals weak vs men equals strong and protective. (spoiler) Multiple wives???? Come on!!! I really loved the background of the movie and the sci-fi idea... but terrible performance."
" Underrated Cult Masterpiece
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,10,"From my perspective and personal opinion this movie long-term will be one that's underrated at it's own time ,but will end up like a classic cult masterpiece through the years. I really loved the cinematic combined with excellent music! This movie really kept me interested all along even though the plot was a little bit slow (but in my opinion everything blended perfectly).. The way the script was written and directed, brilliant acting... not much words needed to be said whereas movie scenes talk on their own! Lots of emotions were generated throughout the movie. Personally I think it was a brilliant movie and something different from what I have seen till now. That's my first review I ever wrote on internet for a movie. Personally I was a little disturbed from the low rating that this movie has earned and driven to write a whole review on my own. In the end it's important not to judge a book by its cover but have your own experience with it! So if you watch it I hope you enjoy as much as I did!"
" Locally sourced food...
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,8,...but not sustainable.Takes a strong stomach to listen to Karma Chameleon...you may want to cover your ears for that part.A tender love story.I agree 100% with the concept of you don't have to be undead to enjoy human flesh. Zombie movies dead? Long live the cannibal movies!
" student film with an indie budget
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,3,"This certainly starts out on the right foot. Sort of. The viewer is never given any explanations at all, which is great, and has to figure out what exactly is going on. That said, the first half hour is very intriguing, if not borderline silly and weird for no real reason.After you get sucked in, having spent that half hour trying to figure things out; the film turns into a very forced art film. The kind that you would normally see at a friend's house in Ann Arbor, and your friend just dropped out of U of M's film school after 3 semesters. Only difference here is this has a good sized budget, and Keanu in a hilariously fake mustache and wig.Deliberately slow, this film forces a ""meditation"" on possibly suburban normalcy or just insider/outsider culture. The last half of the film drags you into a very hip and boring rave with aspirations to be elite. Our hero leaves that to exist in the desert as an outsider eating (possibly) human flesh to survive. That's it.Like I said, the first part gets you hooked, but the last 3/4 of the film I kept reaching for the off button. The train wreck effect kept me watching, even though I rolled my eyes constantly and even said aloud several times, ""oh, come ON already!"" Save your precious time for studying Orson Welles, Godard, or Jodorowsky."
" Fresh call to human instincts
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,10,"I was intrigued when I watched the trailer and I kept waiting for the movie to be out. Once I watched it I was disappointed to read all the bad reviews. Some of them, fortunately only two or three, lack valid arguments and merely state that the movie is bad. I love the photography, I found the choice of the colour palettes pretty good and consistent. There is a pretty good selection of tunes for the soundtrack, they perfectly match the mood of this movie. The rhythm of its cinematography is working well. The story kept me entertained. I could tell that some members wanted sex scenes and other strong imagery but I think it was not necessary. The movie delivers its messages even with a minimal script. There is a basic call to pure human instincts like chemical attraction, fatherhood/motherhood, the life goal search. It is actually more delicate than what I thought It would have been after watching the trailer and I loved this contrast. I look forward to watch more movies from this director."
" Hypnotic and fascinating for a while.
",2017-07-19 00:00:00,6,"""Strange, isn't it? Here we are in the darkest corner of this earth, and we're afraid of our own kind.""You can say ""The bad batch"" is an exceptional and eccentric movie. It impressed me the first 20 minutes. An apocalyptic and insane society, somewhere in a desert on the American continent, where unwanted individuals are being dropped. Are you a criminal, an illegal or an asocial person, you'll get a distinctive tattoo and a hamburger, and you'll be left behind in the scorching heat in this no-man's land. That's what happened to Arlen (Suki Waterhouse). First of all, she wanders around carefree and careless, until she's snatched by ""Mad Max"" -like desert dwellers. Not much later, she loses an arm and a leg. She seems to have fallen in the hands of a gang of unscrupulous cannibals, who needed some fresh meat for their barbecue. In addition to their love for human flesh, they are also avid bodybuilders. Does this already sound absurd enough? Wait, there's more.As an escape tool, Arlen has this brilliant idea of lubricating herself with excrement's (probably making her own flesh distasteful), then she knocks down her guard and escapes into the desert with the help of a skateboard. There she's found by a crazy looking hobo who aimlessly pushes a shopping cart (maybe you'll recognize Jim Carey). And in that way, Arlen ends up in a commune called ""Comfort"". A community filled with normal eating inhabitants, who aren't so normal after all and who follow some sort of leader who repeatedly talks to them about ""The Dream"". He feeds them psychedelic tablets and he's surrounded by a harem of pregnant women who are armed with automatic guns. What you'll see next is a revenge film that slowly evolves into a lunatic, romantic story.Frankly, those first 20 minutes were hypnotic and fascinating. A practically dialogue-free spectacle, full of energy and artfulness with images, silence and a soundtrack which are perfectly complementary. The amputations are horribly realistic. The whole situation is disturbing on the one hand. But on the other hand, it's kind of absurd and comical. A futuristic created environment. A fantasy created in a film, but nevertheless it's not unthinkable that such isolation could exist sometime. An appropriate method of removing those who don't fit into a future society adequately Unfortunately, this creative level couldn't be detained and it became a bit too psychedelic and laughable. Even though Keanu Revees surprised me with his role as a heavily mustached cult leader. He looked like Nicolas Cage while playing in ""Arsenal"" where he had a similar appearance.The moment Arlen starts strolling through the desert hallucinating and completely drugged, while watching a beautiful galactic panorama and afterwards pleased she didn't arrive in Mexico (looked like she walked quite some distance), the innovative and unique character makes room for something less fascinating. I realize Arlen fights an inner struggle while weighing both worlds. And then there's also the influence and appearance of Miami Man (Jason ""Conan the barbarian"" Momoa). An impressive personality causing Arlen to feel something you can call romantic. I also wondered where the ""Follow the dream"" leader could find the right material to build such a luxurious home. Even a water supply is provided for the indoor pool. I doubt they found all this on the dump.Yet, this was more than successful film to me. And not because of the brutal aggressiveness or the repulsive habits. Perhaps I'm more enthusiastic about the ""exploitation"" part it all began with. And maybe I thought the psychedelic, romantic part wasn't that great. But how inventive can you be to provide a soundtrack including Ace of Base, Culture Club and Die Antwoord? Highly recommended, if you are open minded at least. And I bet you'll feel sorry for the little Honey (Jayda Fink).More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc"
" It's just okay.
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,5,"Pros: - It's different. - It's got decent actors. - It's got Keanu Reeves.Cons: - It's a lot of work for the return. - Story is so-so. (Okay, it's not very satisfying to me, but I'm trying to be open minded). - It's got Keanu Reeves. - The dream cult.Casual CannibalismThis goes in the pros list if you're pro casual cannibalism, otherwise in the cons.Review Overview:The movie is just okay which is not really okay. The desert post-apocalyptic genre is almost as played out as the zombie genre. So if you're going to make another movie about this, at least have something more to add or something to say. You could *not see this film* and you wouldn't have missed anything. The only interesting part for me was the dream cult. The movie could be titled ""A year in the life of the fine young cannibals"".Gripes: The overall 'world' doesn't make much sense to me. Why is there cannibalism when there is, apparently, a reasonable amount of food. I guess this makes it more of a ""life choice""? - Why would a group tolerate being preyed upon by the cannibals? - Would there really be a group of pumped up weight lifters when food is so scarce? - Maybe if you spent less time skate boarding you could farm more food?"
" Burning woman.
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,7,"Hoo boy. This movie requires some effort. What starts off as a brutal exploitation flick, surely to weed out the meek, evolves into an absorbing treatise on primal human conditions in a barren, deserted wasteland.While Ana Lily Amipour's sophomore effort contains pulpy roots, littered with outrageous characters and circumstances, it also tackles some grand topics. Our white trashy heroine Arlen is unceremoniously turfed out of society to fend for herself behind a Texan fence, where lawlessness and depravity are the rule of the day. She is soon captured by a tribe of cannibals, and mayhem ensues.Dystopian futures as these don't seem all that far fetched any more. ""The Bad Batch"" may serve as a warning, but chiefly it serves as dusty entertainment. Much like the ""Mad Max"" franchise, it is a world full of crazies scrambling to survive in glorious sunbaked vistas. Sporting a primo porn stash, Keannu Reeves pops up as a bizarro, robe clad cult leader. Giovanni Ribisi slips in several rambling, asylum escapee diatribes, but it is an unrecognizable Jim Carrey who absolutely steals the movie as a wizened bag man.""The Bad Batch"" has the art junk, lost inhibition, drug and music orgy feel of Burning Man, and because it's stealthily asking tough questions, has much more going for it than the cheap veneer may indicate."
" Very interesting movie
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,8,"A very interesting movie that at first glance seems boring, but it needs to look a little deeper into things. For example, today's trend is everywhere in the world that people exercise bodybuilding, and as the main source of protein is meat, so we begin to look like cannibals. Everyone is strong, enjoying music, and only ""meat"" is important. On the other hand, there are those who are weaker and injured by bodybuilders, which in real life manifests as if they are not handsome, but they are nevertheless complex and have some kind of entertainment. And there is also a love story that connects incompatible, which tells us that physical appearance is not important in life, but what someone does for us - for us. The saying ""never say never"" is present here and this is seen by a girl who wanted to hurt Miami Man first, but later fell in love with him. Although the world is a desert and a deserted world, there is hope for them, and they will never be handed over at the price of everything, while in the real world it is increasingly important for us, for example, of material things (whether the guy has a car, apartment, and of course money) After that follows something (feeling).This is my view of the film, which is a bit boring, but when we look a little better about the things in the movie and we alter the reality and sadness we will see a lot of similarities and a lot of educational things."
" Modern Mini Cult Masterpiece
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,10,"A Masterpiece. Acting, Characters, Cinematic, Soundtrack, Plot, everything is there SOLID. Absolutely solid flick. Average guy don't understand just like average guy don't understand himself. First movie characters are actually an alter ego of the actors so its perfect acting method style. ALL the actors are perfect, all of them. The plastic of the movie is intense, amazing. Painting style. A Master of film making. The plot is just cool for the story. I like the silence of the movie, not only it elevates it in intelligence but also fits a lot to the setting of the movie and makes it even more realistic. Soundtrack is glamorous and ferocious."
" Not sure how to review this?
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,1,OK If you want to wonder how someone could have those kinds of actors and make a mess of a movie watch this one. I struggle to call this a movie. As a movie generally tries to tell some kind of a story. I like a movie that leaves me asking questions. This one left me asking two.WTF was this?Can I get my 2 hours refunded back to me ? as I would like to spend it in line at the DMV.If someone sees this with no prior knowledge of the premise they would be lost as it would make zero sense to them. They may wonder where the rest of the movie is?I know I did.Nothing was explained even a little. I have never used the expression worst movie I have ever seen. But I am for this one.
" Wait for netflix, or maybe don't
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,1,"It's like someone explaining their bad trip at burning man for like, 2 hours, and somehow they never saw anything interesting. Two hours at the trash fence, with Jason Momoa walking around looking buff. It seems to be mostly set in dumps. Spoiler alert - the bunny does not make it. If I did not see it in the theatre I would never have made it to the end. This is called the Sunk Costs Fallacy."
" Weird posts apocalyptic movie, but a large part is not entertaining enough.
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,6,"It's a surrealistic movie about a girl seeking redemption over the fact that some cannibals living in the dessert ate her arm and leg.This is the second time I herd Jason Momoa play a Latino. He's trying to get good at the accents. I don't know if he is Latino, I assumed that he was Samoan or partly like Dwayne Johnson. Guess Momoa is trying not to be typecast (Although there are not enough Samoans in Hollywood).Jim Carrey is in the movie. He's actually amazing in it. It's more of a drama, and Carrey gives us the best laugh of the movie, it was so good.The Bad Bacth has not much going on in it. Most likely better if I was on weed. It's very slow and it's not all the best slow."
" Wildly Addictive
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,10,"If you walk out of a movie and still think about it days later, that's when you know you have found a good thing. It hasn't left my mind.This was a wildly addictive roller coaster ride! A truly breathtaking experience that had me unexpectedly laughing out loud at the very last scene. The slow parts went unnoticed to me because I spent most of that time lapping up the dry, desert landscape. The desert has always been a nightmare to me, symbolizing destitution and extreme survival-ism. When our heroine was released into the empty abyss in the very start, I felt overwhelmed with the feeling of not just desperation, but extreme isolation as well.I enjoyed how unpredictable this was. The storyline was basic, but enough to drive the movie forward and the characters too. Keanu Reeves really shined in this. Though he wasn't a huge character, whatever scenes he did have were brilliantly done. Momoa's presence was strong too, overshadowing Suki Waterhouse every time they were present together. I would have loved if there was more time between them to justify labeling it a love story. At the same time, with the direction the story ultimately took in the end, I think it wasn't her affection for the big guy that pushed her to do what she did, but the human basic instinct of wandering that did.We are all wanderers, and yet we live our lives trapped in one fixed point to survive one day after the next. I felt this movie highlighted that when Waterhouse took refuge in Comfort, yet couldn't stop herself from wandering out every so often. I truly enjoyed every character on screen. Jim Carrey was on point! I loved that he too was a wanderer, moving from one point to the next.Without giving it away, I am happy with how it ended. Though there were plot holes, I didn't let them deter my experience in the slightest. I know this film is not your typical mainstream film, and it will be lost on most of the viewership, but give it a try and decide for yourself! Sometimes odd is good!"
" Awful movie.
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,1,"I feel sick for having to watch 20 minutes of this movie. Whoever made this movie is not a sane person. This is bad for anyone's mental health. Don't watch this movie if you want to keep your sanity. Movies like these should really not be allowed to be aired. I understand bad movies, but this is not a bad movie, this is horrible. I can't go to sleep now."
" Lacking in atmosphere...
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,4,"Good idea, looks good, great cast... What could go wrong?Well, besides it being incredibly boring (with the odd spark of brilliance, good turn by an almost unrecognisable Jim Carrey) it just lacks depth.I didn't find myself warming to any of the characters, it was all superficial and in the end I found myself just wondering what else I could be watching instead.This film will probably get some sort of cult following but it doesn't deserve it."
" Ana Lily Amirpour's ""Bad Batch"" feels like a ""Mad Max"" film directed by Robert Rodriguez. . .
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,6,"Keanu Reeves sports a 70's porn moustache, simply called ""The Dream"" and the homeless mute, ""Hermit,"" is the unrecognisable Jim Carrey! The 2 Best (or otherwise unique) Things to watch out for is in the summary. . . The Bad Batch opens with a lingering shot of a sign that says, ""Beyond this fence is no longer the territory of Texas. That hereafter no person within the territory beyond this fence is a resident of the United States of America or shall be acknowledged, recognised, or governed by the laws and governing bodies therein. Good Luck.""That sign is the foundation of Iranian director Ana Lily Amirpour's extensive world building in her sophomore film. Amirpour struck gold with her directorial debut, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. The vampire spaghetti western used very little dialogue and mainly relied on the universe that it inhabited. The Bad Batch is a similar concept and feels like a Mad Max film directed by Robert Rodriguez. It's gritty and dirty but doesn't rely on shock value to move the film forward.The film follows Arlen (Suki Waterhouse), an ex-convict who is now a part of the ""Bad Batch,"" a group of people rejected from society. She's kicked in a barren wasteland left to fend for herself against cannibals that rule the land. When they eventually capture her, Arlen's limbs are sawed off for dinner, and she barely escapes with her life. After being saved by a homeless mute (played by an unrecognisable Jim Carrey), she's brought to ""Comfort,"" a town that thrives on drugs and hedonism. Their leader is a man simply called The Dream (Keanu Reeves), who sports a 70's porn moustache and pregnant concubines with machine guns. Reeves can talk about human faeces like it's holistic mambo jumbo and we will buy every single word of it.The first 19 minutes of the film purely silent and lets the camera do the talking. Cinematographer Lyle Vincent utilises wide camera shots to illustrate the vast nothingness of this world. Despite having so much space, it's claustrophobic and gives us a sense of hopelessness. It's when the dialogue starts to become more frequent that the film starts to falter."
" weird with a side of bbq'd weird
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,2,"I have no idea what made me watch this movie other than Jason Momoa without a shirt. It was just bad that just got worse but I kept watching just to see how far it went. Suki Waterhouse, Jason Momoa, Giovanni Rabisi, Jim Carrey, and Keanu Reeves. How did this happen? They must have lost a football bet or something. Plot points, the desert, wind, bbq'd human limbs, midnight raves, drugs, preggo stepford wives, 70's era cult leader, mental illness, bad accents from bad actors and a bunny. This movie left me thirsty, needing a shower, some chapstick and detangler. Why did I watch it again?? oh yeah, shirtless Jason. There was that at least."
" Close to the worst ever? Yeah pretty close
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,1,"Anyone rating this over a 4 is involved with the film. It's just not a good movie, the acting isn't acting and the script was most likely written on dennys napkins at 3am. People claiming there's an age correlation, saying the younger viewer explains the terrible reviews. Much like your fat body is what makes u look fat and not the dress ('you', in a general sense), it's just plain a bad movie. Age has zero to do with it, taste however is a factor. This just another nonsensical self indulgent rubbish where hipsters claim ""if you don't like it then you don't understand it"". No, no, we fully understand it and we understand it's terrible lol. I'm sure the writer and director is a great and talented person and hopefully her next venture will be better. I'd be extremely surprised if the director or any of the actors believe this to be a quality film. This is the type of film where in a few years actors will magically not have it listed on their IMDb page. Take Carry for instance, do you think he'd be rolling the same if the movie was actually good? If it was even mildly good he'd be all over the show making sure everyone knew he was dbag#13 in the film. I mean this is one those films that's so bad in every single aspect that anyone giving marks above 3-4 is related or a part of the film. It's so transparent it's not even cool. Please, we the community of actual viewers beg you to stop skewing the stats for personal gain. To be the best you have to beat the best. Fake reviews, not cool man. Not cool at all. P.s. I do subscribe to the reality that one or two of the positive reviews are legit but c'mon, let's get real here. That is all, please carry on."
" Bad Batch was just bad
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,2,"Whoever wrote this script I am 100 positive is in a bad relationship .. right now. You know the kind of bad relationship where you family has to have an intervention. So this movie was weird but not good weird but bad weird. Multiple unexplained plot lines. I guess we are supposed to read the screenwriters mind. I have more questions than answers after the credits role. Matter of fact who wrote this. If I did someone like what he did to her what he did to ...smh and then .. really. I thought this movie was going to good since I saw Aquaman in the trailer. Aquaman in this movie suck. What's up with that horrible accent also. Oh, you have been quiet the whole movie now you want spaghetti. Warning this movie is pointless"
" Very interesting movie
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,6,"I usually do not like this kind of movie but I have to admit that it catches your attention. It starts out great with a lot of originality but fizzles in the middle and it looks like the writer did not know where to go once all the pieces were in place. Too bad, this showed a lot of promises."
" It wants to be an art-house send-up of exploitation films, but it's just exploitation.
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,2,"I generally try to avoid spoilers, and this is no exception, but there are small details from throughout the course of the story, so I checked the spoiler warning.My wife walked out on this film about five minutes into it, offended by the exploitative abuse-of-woman scene that opened the movie. I stuck it out, and the film improved to the point that it started to look promising, like an art-house post-apocalyptic movie. Unfortunately it then turned boring, with endless scenes of the main character wandering barren desert, then being adopted into ""Comfort"", a seemingly benevolent community with no visible means of survival in a virtually lifeless desert, and wandering aimlessly in that community. The main character followed up with an act of revenge against someone she recognized from the exploitative opening scene, adoption of a member of the exploitative community, some more aimless wandering in Comfort, adoption of a cute animal, and more wandering in the barren desert. Finally, it then finished with an ending in the barren desert that suggested that the writer didn't quite figure out how to satisfactorily conclude the story.I read some reviews by professional critics, many of which which were quite a bit more favorable than my reaction. Although I recognized what they praised the film for, I still didn't like it. The similarity between Comfort and a Burning Man camp are amusing. The pop-culture references in the music track, the debris in the desert and in Comfort, and so forth are amusing. The use of well-known actors in small roles is interesting. But the interesting pieces don't add up to an interesting film.I can see that the writer (who also directed) put a lot of thought into the ideas behind the film, and aspired to something that was both an exploitation film and an art-house send-up of exploitation films -- but she only managed to succeed at making an exploitation film. Maybe if there were more hints about how Comfort was supposed to function, why the ""bad batch"" people had partitioned into two camps, and so forth? Maybe if there were actually an ending that made sense? Often when I see a bad movie, I ask, ""How could this be made into a good movie?"" Sometimes when I see a good movie, I think of ways it could be made even better. But in this case, I can't see any way to make a good movie out of this except a large-scale rewrite.One might ask how so many notable actors ended up in a film this bad. My guess is that they were drawn in by the writer-director's previous work _A Girl Walks Home at Night_, which was well-received by IMDb voters and very well reviewed by professional critics, and didn't expect that her second feature film would be a mess."
" Unsure what this was supposed to be
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,5,"I really enjoyed Ana Lily Amirpour's first (non-short) movie, A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night. It felt like it knew what it wanted to be and had some real atmosphere to it. In contrast, this movie feels very under-written and has an underwhelming lead. Suki Waterhouse is going for some kind of accent but certainly doesn't work. Jason Momoa doesn't fare much better as his character is inexplicably Cuban and struggling through a ""Cuban"" accent. Jim Carrey is in this movie. He does not speak nor do I know why he wanted to be in this movie. I guess it was probably 1 or 2 days of work judging from his screen time. Keanu Reeves fares the best in this and seems to be having fun as the sleazy leader of the town. I have plenty of issues with the plot of this movie. The lead woman Arlen (Suki) has her arm and leg taken but that's not to set-up a revenge story. It's more just something that happened and then she wanders around the desert for a bit and eventually returns to town. The overall look of the movie is one of the highlights. The cinematography is simple but very colourful. But it also ends up bringing out the biggest issue I had with the movie. It just feels like a bunch of pretty scenes that don't fit together as an interesting movie."
" Criminally underrated cannibalism and murder.
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,9,"Ever since I've watched ""A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014)"" this movie has been on my radar. Ana Lily Amirpour is clearly one of the most interesting new directors out there and her next projects should be anticipated. I'm glad to see big name actors like Keanu Reeves and Jim Carrey in her movie, they play their parts brilliantly and will pull a bigger audience. Suki Waterhouse and Jason Mamoa are the main characters and keep you interested the whole way through, but the star of the show is director Ana Lily Amirpour. Her visuals and world creating are definitely the biggest pull of the movie.This movie will probably be watched by the wrong audiences, because of famous actors in it. It's a visual art movie which can be enjoyed by anyone, but is definitely not mainstream. A lot of reviews I see about the movie being to slow are clearly that mainstream voice. It's kind of funny that the people who love ""slow"" artsy movies have to get through the gory cannibalism and murder scenes. You can see how that can split audiences.The style reminds me of Quentin Tarantino in the sense that the art-house and exploitation genre are combined a little. The big difference between Ana Lily Amirpour and Tarantino is that Tarantino can catch that mainstream audience as well. If I knew more about why movies are successful I could tell you why, but I can't help but feel that it has something to do with the fact that this movie has a female director. At least fans of good movies will make this a cult movie, but I really think it deserves more.I cant wait for the next movie Ana Lily Amirpour makes.(9/10) Would recommend."
" Slow even when watched on Fast Forward
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,2,"The negative reviews of this indulgent, self-important drudgery of a film are all accurate. Don't waste your time watching this even for free. Unsympathetic characters acted badly in a visually static hellhole are add up to nothing.Save your attention and precious time for something more worthwhile, like re watching the latest Mad Max film. Now that's genius."
" Watch it with an open mind.
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,8,There seems to be a correlation between reviewer's age and number of stars. Morally deceptive. Nice ratio of rounded versus flat characters. Good cinematography without a whole lot of special effects. It's a little slow; it's suppose to be that way. Currently do not need another line of text.
" Original, but flawed
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,6,"Saw this movie last night at the IFC theater in Greenwich Village. Hard for a 2017 movie to cover new material, but pretty sure a cannibal love story is a first. Keanu Reeves and Jim Carrey kill it. Pacing is a little slow, and could use a little more backstory but definitely a watchable film."
" Most boring movie to come out in a long time
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,1,"I decided to check this out only because Keanu Reeves was in it. It wasn't worth it.This movie is just gross and puts out negative vibes but worst of all, it is extremely boring. It does a poor job of ripping off other movies and tries really hard to be ""art"" but comes off as dull and pretentious.This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.Do yourself a favor and skip this garbage."
" i like it.
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,10,"seem like a low budget but the main actors are not cheap. watch this movie without expectations and you may like it too.the main actress and big bad guy where well cast, and they look good .I just checked to see who was doing the crazy hermit, its Carrey! this guy is the greatest at extreme character personification,id say 7.2"
" A mixed bag
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,7,"I loved writer/director Ana Lily Amirpour's debut A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. A genre-mixing Persian language black and white vampire flick, the film established Amirpour as a fresh voice, a visionary, an all too rare woman of colour working in a genre that has typically been dominated by casually racist and sexist white men who don't think through the implications of their material. With this in mind The Bad Batch represents both a step up and a step down for Amirpour. Set in an undefined near-future The Bad Batch takes place in an unnamed zone outside of Texas in which lawlessness rules and ""Bad Batch"" aka people who are considered deviant in some way, are set adrift. We never learn why Arlen (Suki Waterhouse, serviceable) has been cast out, but we follow her from the second she is dumped in this vicious territory. Quickly captured by cannibals (with gruesome results) she manages to free herself and is rescued by a peaceable hermit. Months later, healed but embittered, she sets out into the wasteland and makes a series of decisions which set the course for the rest of the movie. First off Amirpour proves herself once again to be a complete master of tone. Her wasteland is an '80s baby's pop-punk dream, filled with mad detritus from the '80s and '90s. The post-production here is really top-notch and filled with clever visuals (there is a ton of signage among the wreckage which gives Amirpour the ability to make tongue-in-cheek jabs at the audience, like a scene in which Arlen contemplates a difficult decision while in the background a sign cheerfully proclaims ""THIS ISN'T REAL""). I've heard some reviewers balk at the so-called half-baked romance that takes up the final half of the movie, but to me it feels meditative and real. Much like the romance in Amirpour's debut, this one is as full of quiet suggestion and glances as a Victorian novel adaptation.What then was not to my taste? Well to go back to the earlier discussion of filmmakers in the genre being sloppy, thoughtless or even downright racist with their messaging... Shortly before the film was officially released a woman at an advanced screening raised some criticism about the casting in the movie and she was dead right. The first question she had was about Jason Momoa being cast as a Latino character named ""Miami Man"". In the movie Miami Man isn't just any random Latino, he's an undocumented Cuban immigrant with a thick accent. To have Jason Momoa, an accentless American born man of Native-Hawaiian and white descent feels incredibly tone deaf, the kind of ridiculous casting that was something that wasn't given a second thought in the 50s but is incredibly tired now. The second issue raised was the question of a black female character being given a particularly gruesome death... Again, the entire arc of that character and the fact that Arlen's fall, and later redemption, occur because of this woman's death is treated so carelessly within the narrative it would almost feel like a joke or like Amirpour is making a statement on how irredeemable Arlen is if not for the fact that again and again the movie works to make the audience sympathize with her. It's truly baffling and takes what could have been a good movie and makes it incredibly tone deaf and insensitive to the very racism it seems intended to point out.I hate scoring movies with highs so high and lows so low because it often comes out to a very mediocre score when the movie couldn't be anything further from mediocrity. It's really too bad that Amirpour was so blind to something so essential to her film."
" A whole bunch of wind...and desert
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,5,"I don't really know how to describe this movie, despite the synopsis mentioning cannibals I knew not to expect an Eli Roth film. I was surprised to see Suki Waterhouse as the lead as I wasn't aware she had established herself as a leading actress, but to my surprise I really liked her in this movie. She's in virtually every scene, and she holds her own. Admittedly I sought this movie out primarily because I'm a huge Keanu Reeves fan, and will essentially watch anything he's in, and sure he's in it...but not very much. There are many other famous faces too although you'd be hard pressed to recognize some...Jim Carrey, Diego Luna, Giovanni Ribisi, and not to forget Jason Mamoa (you can't miss him in this movie). Despite the cue of a cast...nothing much happens...a lot of filming of people in the desert, wind in hair, long uncut scenes with very little dialogue. Essentially a slow film, the soundtrack is what propels you through, and simply wanting to see how the story resolves.Not the worst 2 hours of my life...but probably won't watch again, nor would I really recommend it to others, unless you're a die hard Keanu completest like I am."
" Wasted Premise in an acting wasteland.
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,1,"You'll need to suspend all of your disbelief to close the holes in this movie's plot, starting with the pumping-iron, body-building cannibals, working out and living in aluminum airplane wreckage in the burning desert sun, in the middle of nowhere. Sun block anyone? Enter Protagonist Suki Waterhouse, 25, acting age 17, cute and lean, and apparently in the eyes of the body-builders, ready for the BBQ- Grill... Fresh Meat over aged, in wings and legs the saying goes? Predictably, escape follows, and Suki finds Keanu's Village of DJ's, Drugs, Dirt. (Keanu at least has a swimming pool and clean towels) That's Not good enough for Suki, She's in love with the Cubano, the ""Artist"" (and lead cannibal) with the mute daughter. Cubano's Mute Daughter is a MacGuffin.The movie starts off ""OK"", with a good pace, and despite poor acting skill (Suki is mostly eye-candy, with a squeaky voice to match), it maintains an interesting premise. But then dramatically FIZZLES after Suki revenge kills Cubano's girlfriend. Then the ""distopian love story"" plot takes over and the movie is just embarrassing. There is zero chemistry between the actors, the writing is hideously awkward, and the location seems impossible. Grade F. I would recommend the movie: ""A boy and his Dog"" for a successful example of this kind of Protagonist Survival in a post-apocalyptic world (with cannibals.)"
" Director's sophomore effort is definitely a slump
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,1,"I was really looking forward to the director's follow up to ""A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night"" but after seeing it I'm incredibly disappointed. There are a lot of things that work here;the direction and pacing of the film are spot on with some nice cinematography and some interesting choices along the way. Likewise, most of the actor's contribute some nice work here including the much lauded cameos by Jim Carey and Giovanni Ribissi and the high profile appearances of Jason Momoa and Keannu Reeves. (None of whom did this film because they ""needed a paycheck"" by the way but was a chance to work with the Sundance Institute and/or an up and coming director they wanted to support.) Carey was really surprising, it took me a few minutes before I even realized it was him and Momoa shows he's got real acting chops but it was Keannu Reeves who really stole the show for me. He goes against type and really brings the creepy to his role of a ""Jim Jones"" type cult leader. It would be interesting to see him play an out and out villain in a future role. As for Suki Waterhouse, I honestly have no idea whether she can act or not because the script is so bad, littered with wooden dialogue and bad choices throughout, that it's impossible to tell. The characters consistently make decisions or take actions that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. We are not talking your typical Hollywood tropes either (Going down to the basement alone, saying ""I'll be right back,"" etc...you know the drill)NO, we are talking actions and decisions that are so wrong they are insulting to the viewer. Example, after narrowly escaping from a group of cannibals and finding safety in a small town, our hero, sans two limbs mind you, immediately wanders BACK OUT into the desert right back towards the cannibal community.She then, over the course of the rest of the movie, proceeds to fall for the head cannibal. A man who participated in a barbecue involving her arm and leg!! I kid you not. I actually found this offensive. And I'm not offended easily. I am baffled as to how the director even considered this line of action for the character or even what the point was. I'm totally mystified as to how anyone could have thought this was a good idea. I found myself very irritated with Ms. Waterhouse's character, to the point that I yelled at the screen several times during the film, so annoyed was I at the character's stupid decisions and at the creators themselves for letting this character be such an idiot. It was like a roll back to before Buffy, when women in horror or sci-fi were nothing but mindless eye candy. You'd think Ellen Ripley had never happened. And this during the week ""Wonder Woman"" came out. So, there you go. I hate to be so harsh but I have no idea what Ms. Amirpour was going for here and in the future suggest she stick to directing, for which she is quite capable. Just do us all a favor and leave the screenplay to someone else."
" Wow could have been so much better
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,2,"There are 4 big name actors in this movie first off Jim Carey who back in the 90 along Tommy Lee Jones where big, they where everywhere and they won pretty much everything and now he is reduced to playing small part in movies like this what happen to him? Keanu Reeves ? the matrix speed John Wick what are you doing in this? honestly.........Jason Momoa conan aquaman but he is known for doing a few awful b movies i guess a paycheck is a paycheck still he is super fit in this movie an inspiration for me at 45.Diego Luna starting to make a name for himself star wars rogue one, elysium but man what where you thinking taking a role in this awful movie.There is almost no dialogue in this movie, if it was handled correctly it could have been great, a good story and script.The base story was a great ideal poorly executed. Its walking and more walking useless talk then more walking and so on.... it makes no sense at all.Skip this one even arrow in the head gave it a 3 so you know its bad."
" Get by the initial cannibalism thing...
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,9,"It turns into a Mad Max-like love story. Brutal at times, but very sensitive in an animalistic way. About an hour in, there's a fantastic hallucinogenic/tripping scene, great technical film work. As an aside, you aren't likely to pick Jim Carrey out of the end-times crowd. Keanu Reeves has a great part later in the story, a role that made me think about Hugh Hefner's place in humanity. Thumbs up!"
" Defiantly a movie you must see for yourself to decide.
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,8,"Excellent sound track to this mostly non violent dystopian tale of a girl out of place amongst the out of place. Fans of the genre who enjoy a break from standard box office type fair should enjoy this film, thou it may disappoint some. Defiantly a movie you must see for yourself to decide. Avoid if you expect an action packed blood thirsty movie.With almost a touch of misanthropy Arlen (Suki Waterhouse) navigates her way around a sparsely populated desert type area after an unfortunate event. We are not quite sure if she wants love or revenge. Keep your eyes peeled for Jim Carrey if you can recognize him."
" The Bad Batch (2016)
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,6,"Continuing the trend of desolate Texas locale, I decided to watch The Bad Batch. I did not see Ana Lily Amirpour's A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, despite hearing really good things about it. I did see the trailer for The Bad Batch a few months back and thought it looked good. It seemed like the type of film that I would enjoy an artsy, stylish, female protagonist driven film that remains memorable. While that description is fairly apt, I could not help but feel disappointed by what I have seen. Its not terrible, I'm just struggling to praise the film as I would have wanted to.The film looks to be a dystopian film that takes place in a wasteland in Texas. Arlen (our protagonist portrayed by Suki Waterhouse) is attacked early on in the film and has her arm and leg cut off and eaten. The area is ravaged by cannibalistic tendencies as people must hunt each other to survive. She eventually adapts to her missing limbs and comes across a little girl and her father, who are at first at odds but then begin to bond against the negative forces around them. The entirety of the film basically takes place in a desert like barren landscape, think Mad Max but way less on action and plot.The film is too long for what is offered. There is minimal dialogue (which is okay if the screen time is being filled with something worth getting invested in). That is not the case with this picture. You find it hard to care for the characters who just kill each other and have no real redeeming qualities. Some of the shots in the film are quite nice but there is little to no reward sticking through the film. Its nice to see Jason Momoa in other films; I think he has the look of an action star which is why I think he'll do well as Aquaman.The narrative in this film is like the wasteland which this film takes place: its barren and nothing grows. I still want to see Amirpour's previous film because perhaps this was just a risky misfire. There aren't really any memorable moments or scenes that can detract from the general uninteresting plot development. Maybe others will find some joy out of this but this just wasn't for me.5.5/10"
" Desperately trying to be cool
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,2,"This is another film that screams ""I want to be a cult movie!"" but just doesn't have what it takes. It starts out promising and then seems to have absolutely nowhere to go; it just becomes long, ponderous and self-indulgent. As someone who grew up going to midnight movies, ""The Bad Batch"" seems like its taken elements from these films (""El Topo,"" ""Mad Max,"" ""Kill Bill"") and stitched them all together in the hopes it'll hit the mark somewhere. The performances in the film are adequate, but nothing in the script really demands much of the characters. Ms. Amirpour obviously had the support of actors like Diego Luna, Jim Carrey and Keanu Reeves, all of whom are seen briefly, but I'm willing to bet they never saw much of a script. At two hours, there's probably half an hour of real material here, the rest just feels like padding."
" Much Ado about nothing......
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,3,"There are three previous reviews about this film ranging from 3 of 10 to 9 of 10. I won't bore you with the lengthily details of the entire film as one reviewer did. (Would not be surprised at all if He/She had some direct connection with the making of the film, etc) I am always up for cerebral, off color, non conformist, anti-Hollywood type films and praise those who make them. I am not, however, a fan of films that aim high to be recognized as deeply artistic and thought provoking when the film fails miserably in achieving that goal.There are at least four big name actors in this mess and there is hardly any dialog through almost 2 hours of run time. This is not to say Dialog makes a film great. Often silence and facial expression and body language speaks volumes. Sadly, this is not the case in ""the Bad Batch"". BORING is the first word that comes to mind to describe this film. The story line and plot are all over the place. Th film is set in a supposed Apocalaptic setting with a two caste system. One being cannibals, the other the privileged, if you can call it that. To categorize this film as ""Romance/ Sci-Fi"" is utterly misleading. There is absolutely No romance in this film nor is there any Science Fiction in it anywhere. I would categorize this film as a Dark Drama. The only redeeming quality of the film is the score in my opinion. None of the story telling is explained or resolved and you meander through the film (as do the characters) with no purpose. Here is my take on the film.....Girl is captured, has her leg And arm amputated barbarically, which is used for food BTW, by a group of cannibals. Girl escapes, finds woman in desert, kills her and takes daughter, head cannibal sets out to find daughter, finds girl sans two limbs, sets her out on a mission to find little girl. Girl finds little girl at another ""camp"" of the higher caste and recovers little girl, meets Said Gorilla cannibal in desert, film ends!Two hours of time I'll never recover. Swallowing glass would be less painful then watching this again. Reviewers can wax philosophical all they want, ""the bad Batch"" is just plain BAD!"
" Extraordinary Film That Hugely Defies Initial Viewer Expectations
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,9,"Most films tell you what they're about by their style and their trappings, and what happens in the opening scenes. THE BAD BATCH opens in a recognizably post-apocalyptic sort of setting (although it actually isn't -- more on that in a moment) and immediately features brutal, grisly violence. But the story that unfolds is completely unlike what you'd expect given that beginning.To begin with, it's not shot like an action / adventure movie. The pace is measured, even contemplative, and the camera lingers on the actors' faces. In other words, it's shot like a family drama ... and in a way it is. I was moved nearly to tears by the movie's climax; to say that was the last thing I expected after the opening scenes would be a massive understatement.It is, above all, tremendously thought-provoking. (And you now can see that in two or three important ways it's the polar opposite of MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, a very clear influence and of course brilliant in its own completely different way.) First and foremost, it's an examination of the nature of morality and moral choices. There's a scene where you will ask yourself whether the act you have just seen was justified, indefensible, or some indescribable mixture of the two, even as you watch Suki Waterhouse (in a tremendous breakout performance) ask herself the same question -- what have I just done, and was it good or bad? The moral situation at the movie's end unconsciously evokes Ursula K. Le Guin's classic short story ""The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas"" (after a special screening in Boston, writer / director Ana Lily Amirpour confirmed she was unfamiliar with it).It's also a potent and cutting commentary on the problem of income inequality. The movie is actually set in the near future, where ""bad batch"" characters are exiled to a lawless fenced enclave in the former Texas desert, and left to fend for themselves. Unlike an actual post-apocalyptic setting, there's no inherited privileged class, and there's a lot less wealth for the powerful to hoard. It's never spoken of, but the characters seem always aware that whatever luxury they can achieve pales beside that which they left behind. It changes their psychology completely. So although the trappings are completely familiar, the situation is in fact utterly original. That originality underlies the moral situation and the depth of characterization.The movie defies another convention: it never bothers to explain what seem (on surface) to be unlikely elements of the portrayed world. However, Amirpour says she did extensive world-building and even devised complete back stories for every character. Her strategy is to keep viewers as uninformed as the characters themselves. That may bother some, but I think it adds immensely to the movie's weight and power.The film features a fine turn by Keanu Reeves as the leader of a settlement called (perhaps without irony) Comfort, and a wordless and barely recognizable Jim Carrey in a few key scenes, at least one of which is darkly hilarious. Giavanni Ribisi and Diego Luna show up in small roles, so you know that people wanted to do this movie. Jason Momoa (Aquaman) is excellent in a lead role, but it's Waterhouse that ultimately makes it all work.It's shot almost entirely outdoors, and it's so impressive to look at that I plan to see it a second time on an even bigger screen. It borrows many familiar trappings but is almost startling in its refusal to use them in stereotypical ways, and it has haunted my brain since the moment the lights went up. In short, it's an exemplary addition to the small but growing group of art-house science fiction films. It more than fulfills the promise of Amirpour's art-house horror debut, A GIRL WALKS HOME ALONE AT NIGHT, and marks her as a major figure to watch in genre cinema."
" Walking around, more walking, oh and did I mention walking?
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,2,"I was excited to see this movie after reading the synopsis a couple of days before the screening. As the title of this summary suggests, there is a lot of walking in this movie. The story starts out semi promising with you wondering what happened to the earth but ends up being the walkiest and least talkiest movie I've ever seen. I know those aren't words but goddammit they get my point across. The main actress is forgettable, Jason Momoa, Jim Carrey, and Keanu Reeves were miscast or maybe it was just the bad script? Possibly both? Back to the walking part, with minimal dialogue and no action whatsoever, this movie becomes a student film really quick. What I mean is that they don't cut out all the walking around and other useless scenes that should have obviously been taken out. There isn't really a story, it's sort of tried to take elements from Mad Max and other post apocalyptic films that are much better than it and hope the audience notices and doesn't care or doesn't notice at all.My suggestion: don't see it unless you want to be bored to death.Seen at TIFF 2016."
