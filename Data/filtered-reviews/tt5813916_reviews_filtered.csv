" Great work
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,9,"The hatred on this movie is just so funny.Negative reviews are purely nonsense: These people are comparing this movie with random movies, which explains that they haven't even watched the movie. Rating this movie less than 5 stars just shows pure jealousy.Americans calling this movie a propaganda is laughable. Just imagine being American and hating on a low budget movie like this because it's high rated and commenting about propaganda? The director has done amazing work with that budget."
" Great acting. Touching story.
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,8,"Aside from patriotic 10/10 and balancing 1/10 ratings, I sincerely think it was a good movie. You'd probably like it if you like the genre.This is the story of maroon berets (Turkish special forces) operating a rescue mission in Iraq.Good:Acting is realistic. I am not sure if subtitles reflect this accurately to foreigners but I found the relationship between squad members very convincing and natural.The story is touching. Turkey has borders with Syria and Iraq, which may be the most troubled countries in the world right now. There are also many Turkish villages in Syria/Iraq, not far from the border. This adds an emotional side to Turkey's involvement in those areas. I really liked how the movie reflects on this. You might call this propaganda, but that doesn't change this fact.Some might say the movie glorifies Turkish soldiers in an unrealistic way. I disagree. The squad in question is an elite force, one of the most respected units in Turkish army. They are extremely talented and well-trained in real life as well.They use real weapons from the inventory of Turkish military. I am not an expert but I also liked how the actors handled the guns.Bad:Visual effects, obviously. This of course relates to budget issues but it can be distracting at times.Enemies could be smarter.I think the last fighting scene falls short from a tactical point of view.A bit one-sided."
" A Turkish Seven Samurai on a mountain top? It works.
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,7,"Couldn't figure our exactly who they were fighting. ISIS, Kurds ???Interesting that they were doing it all with US weapons.The take away is that SPECOPS are SPECOPS whether they be US or Turkish (Who I suspect they were US trained) but each nation has its own national flavor as to how they conduct operations. This leads to some good insights into Turkish (government approved) culture.Turkish propaganda? Absolutely.But a good action flick with a lot of the right buttons pushed? Yeah.I Liked it."
" Not worth your time
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,1,"Turkish nationalism meets Bollywood.
They tried hard but not enough to make a special forces movie but came ot a ridiculous mix of India's frentic dances, bad scenification on the usage of warfare utilery, modern life scenes in actual Turkey, even flirting scenes lol etc. A bad milkshake."
" Quite good movie.
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,7,"I always believe if you want to evaluate a movie fairly, you should look at the movie itself, not something behind it.This movie is quite good, I have to say, but there are still obvious shortages. The storyline, some acting, some plot design, got room to improve. It's good but not good enough, so I rated 7.Average 8.8? That's too high. Shame on those who put -ism into their judgement to a movie."
" Pretty good for what it is
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,7,This movie certainly is not an eight or 10 star movie. It is pretty good for what it is. Which is your typical special forces team sent to free a prisoner from terrorist and who must make it with her to the extraction point along the way they come across some innocents caught in the middle and have to decide whether to strictly stick with the mission or stay and defend the innocents. You can pretty much figure out what happens after that. The reason I do not rate it higher than a seven is because of everything in between where the film uses flashbacks of the soldiers training and tries to correlate it to events happening on the mission. I thought this was way too drug out and really distracted from the actual mission which was the best part of the movie. Top all of that off with a heavy dose of Turkish propaganda and you get a Turkish version of Acts of Valor. That being said and without giving away any spoilers the last battle scene was somewhat incredulous.
" Masterpiece
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,9,Alper Caglar is such a talented guy. Wait for more surprises.
" Was that really Turkish !!!
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,10,This is the best Turkish movie ever I have seen.nice a storyline with nice v effect.
" Watched it by mistake - enjoyed throughly
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,9,"So, I started watching 'Brothers in Arms' on Prime Video - but it was actually Mountain 2 - wrongly labelled on Prime Video!I wanted to watch an action War type movie - so carried on watching and thoroughly enjoyed it,Hoping they release Mountain 1 on Amazon or Netflix- will keep an eye out.Yes it is cheesy in places - but no more so than any similar Hollywood movie."
" One of the greatest military movies!!!!!
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,10,"It is one of the greatest military movies and i think it is greatest Turkish military movie ever. Yes it has some patriotic and nationalist elements, but these are dont decrease the quality of movie. It was deep and has some psychological elements too. You may think the action effects(like explosions) weren't realistic enough. Yes, you are right about that. Yes, American action movies have way better effects. But you shouldn't compare this movie with hollywood movies that have 100 million dollars budget. Because this movie have only 500K dollars budget!!! And it was realistic enoguh with this budget."
" extremely overrated
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,2,"The movie is exciting like a video game of a sniper that kills enemies but really it is not that amazing to get 8+ because of at least 2 main reasons:firstly after getting to the village, it is ridiculously a full copy of ""Saving Private Ryan (1998)"" scene by scene. watch the two movies and you will easily realize what I mean by full copy.secondly there were so many unnecessary and meaningless flashbacks that in my opinion only waste your time.I still wonder why it got 8+ rating ( for me it was like a full copy video game)"
" Masterpiece.... No... Average Military Flick.. Yes. 100K+ REviews - Somethings Fishy
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,6,"Tooo Dull to have such a high rating... 100K+ Reviews .. I dont get it... There are some well oiled Turkish SEries which dont have that many ratings. Watched it only because of the rating.. Didnt care to look into reviews. MOvie is cliched. You hardly fall in love with characters. Its predictable. Only the last action sequence has some appeal, rest of it is just below average stuff.
Go Watch the WOLF on Netflix. That too is propaganda but has high quality action sequences and beautifully written characters."
" AWFUL
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,1,Just ridiculously awful. It just gets its high score from patriotic people. The movie isnt strategically or militarely correct by any means. It just looks like some people came together and decided to make a military movie. I wish there was the option to give minus points for this movie as it stole my not so valuable time.
" Bringing patriotic movies to a ridiculous climax
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,3,As a non Turkish person this movie is even compared to bad US patriotic movies like Hacksaw Ridge ridiculous. 2.5 hours containing only heroic words and completely unbelievable scenes that would not even happen in bollywood. Even effects were pretty bad for 2016 and a movie that was probably funded by the Turkish government.
" Must watchable, best film
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,8,"I saw this without seeing the first part but still I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The Mountain II shows perspective on both sides both civilian, the military and the journalist. It shows also why journalist do what they do show the cruelty that is in the world and why they criticize violence against violence and human rights. It shows also the civilians who fall in between as victims and the conflict of standing by to do your duty or doing what you know is right. The Mountain II is movie that makes you realize how life is precious and how honour and duty.The explanation by the team leader to this fellow commando on saving the journalist was top notch. Even the contents of the letter which team leader gives to journalist was very well done.In this movie we see a lots of great examples of best visual effects. And also it has its own realistic scenes as well. The connection between soldiers were so great, enthusiastic and natural.I give this movie my highest recommendation. If you want to watch military movie from Turkish cinema, you should watch this movie. Must watchable movie."
" The truth
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,10,"MAK is the real deal, this is just an attempt to reveal the true heroes of warfare!"
" Just Outstanding
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,10,"I rarely take the time to write reviews but was compelled to for this gem. Acting, cinematography, music are superb. Storyline is built very well using flashback. Action is gripping. The selfless motivation of brave men to defend their countrymen is palpable and inspiring. One of the finest films of any genre I've seen in a long time. Kudos to the team who wrote, produced, directed and acted in this. Hollywood would be envious."
" A Turkish national orgasm, but good action scenes.
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,4,"The high ratings must be coming from Turks only, because for other nationalities the nationalism is irritating. The Turkish soldiers are noble, intellectual, poetic, righteous, and heroic of course. It's unrealistic and a bit childish. But still the action scenes are pretty good. But not very original. The second half of the movie is clear Saving Private Ryan rip-off."
" Half of the points are fake.
",2019-12-24 00:00:00,6,"Even Turks are voted 10 so much, there is no 100.000 active users in Turk IMDb user. There is only 50.000 votes for really famous movies. This movie is reached 100.000 in just 1 year. Half over-rated and the other half is fake. A good movie but not an amazing one. And if you are not Turk don't watch, it will be waste of time for you. And If you are just watch another movie don't expect an amazing movie because of this point."
" Really?
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,1,"Watched the film out of curiosity, no doubt the Turks have a good SF just as good as any other country. But this was pure propaganda nationalistic bull. How this film achieved over 9 is a mystery.
Tears of the Sun ripoff."
" Maybe, this is not something you can understand.
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,7,"If you are not exposed to Turkish culture and atmosphere, you should not watch this film because there is nothing aimed at you. This film makes sense and bring home to only those people. I cannot say it is a 9 rated film but it is a decent film, maybe one of the best films ever made in Turkey. If you expect it will have some American or European cultural ideas, there is not even a mention and it will disappoint you at the end of the film. There is no intention to make a Turkish Army propaganda in the plot and I must say some of critics are stereotypically underestimating the Turkish Army which is not the one as same as in the film's so these all the comments are wrong (perhaps this is another disappointment for some people). They have only created a story about military soldiers and the messes they deal with and it is only a cinema film."
" great
",2019-11-20 00:00:00,10,"As an American with no knowledge of Turkish SF I wasn't sure what to expect of this 'war movie' but it was a very pleasant surprise. Turkish soldiers go into Iraq to rescue a journalist. If this 'plot' sounds familiar its because it is; very similar films have been made before Bravo Two Zero with the SAS, and Tears of the Sun with the US Navy Seals. This movie had great battle scenes, heroic soldiers, heroic women, it rivaled any Hollywood film I've seen on the subject--very well done"
" Nothing great with bloated ratings
",2019-11-19 00:00:00,3,"Watched this movie due to its unbelievably high ratings .but it was a disappointing affair with mediocre acting, writing and forced nationalism.These movies have in country following and not for international audiences. Such a let down"
" Just excellent.
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,10,"I picked this film to watch while listening to rain outside and sitting with a full stomach. Expectations were low, I don't usually like films with subtitles and I'm usually disappointed by ""hero"" films. However, this film excelled in story, cinematography, accuracy, acting and humour. My limited Turkish didn't matter, the subtitles actually added to the effect and every character was completely credible. It shows ISIS for what they are / were too.I can't recommend this film highly enough!"
" Honest review from a Turk
",2019-10-29 00:00:00,4,"This movie is unfortunatly away from reality. I don't like movies like this with unrealistic heroism. It's like badly produced american propagandist movie.As military service is still mandatory in Turkey, we all know that military and war is not something like this. It's much more chaotic and shocking. This movie produced to impose military propaganda while Turkey was fighting in Syria.If you want to see a 'real-life' war movie, check Nefes (The Breath) which is showing psychology of soldiers and reality of war."
" Chuke Norris will like it
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,1,I watch just first hour of this movie and i can say this deserve a -10 rating.
" That's not fair.
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,1,"Bad acting. Boring.
That's not fair."
" Great movie!
",2019-09-30 00:00:00,10,"First of all I want to say few things to people who voted this movie with one or two stars. I just don't get how could expect neutrality in this kind of a movie. This movie is made to show people how heroic, merciful and professional is the Turkish Special Forces. The movie is dedicated to fallen heroes of this country. I don't expect you to get the feeling that I get but at least be reasonable while voting this kind of a movie. It does not aim neutrality in anyways."
" So idiotic and unprofessionally done
",2019-08-20 00:00:00,1,"I just can't believe this movie got 9 out 10 rating. It is the worst movie I ever watched about the combat. It is so naive and unprofessionally made, it is just laughable. Who in the right mind bring their country flag on the secret mission? They should learn from Americans and Russians how to make movies about the war. The actors did a terrible job, they simply can't act."
" I don't get it
",2019-08-15 00:00:00,1,How could this even be a 5 🌟? I guess you need to be Turkish to understand the greatness of this movie.
" Grabs lines and storyline from Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,4,"I liked it just as well as the first one but this one had more action, however, the first one had an original storyline and this one didn't, if you analyze the storyline after the middle of the movie it's just the same as Saving Private Ryan, a mission or objective is to save 1 person, then when you finally get to her you end up staying to protect instead of a bridge, a village full of people, stole the idea of the Bell tower with a sniper being shot with a tank, stole the idea of creating a bottle neck with explosives to block the street, stole the idea of the last stand structure, even stole the character of the rookie worthless soldier running through the streets with ammo aka Upham but instead a girl. I felt like I was watching low budget Saving Private Ryan, even the commander said a few words to Oguz as in the ""Earn this Ryan"" before dying.
In one scene they stole a popular and final quote from Band of Brothers where a son asks his father if he was a hero back in the war, but instead of replying that he served in a company of heroes, he says that he served one.I agree with other low rating reviews, the movie is not thrash for a low budget but stealing a lot of scenes and quotes from other movies is just not right, the high rating should be because the sense of nationalists that just vote high because it's Turkish, I mean it has better effects that my country movies but I would still vote low if the movie sucks even if it's my country.For the rating you come with super high expectations and came out pretty disappointed.Watch the first one then forget about the second, it's not worth the disappointment. If you want to watch low budget Saving Private Ryan then go for it."
" Still great as the 1st though at times slow
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,9,"The first was a breathtaking film that I rated 10 and the second one close but a bit more entertainment oriented and at times slow. At the end it makes me feel great so I rate it with a genuine 9.The fact that Turks rate this film higher is not necessarily an act of propoganda. These are our capable soldiers fighting to save a Turkmen populated village from Isid militants so why not feel proud?Plus the film had very good cinematography, decent acting and an acceptable soundtrack and a well-written scenario. It is not cinematic perfection but I loved it as a filmwatcher. I am not a film critic and need not review as such."
" Not what I expected it to be.
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,1,"I dozed off several times while watching it on laptop, because the movie is way too slow and that without any tension-creation and suspense. Nothing happens especially when you are expecting something tense is going to make movie more interesting any soon. I was constantly kept on waiting to be glued into the plot of the movie, but all in vain. Its screenplay is weak. The script could have become more interesting and attention- grabbing with more details and twists in the story. Speaking of acting, it is not at all to the nearer of what we witness in the Hollywood movie with 7+ rating. Characters were written fairly, but they lacked in developing connection with audience through communicating with their roles and acting. Cinematography is good. My only favorite scene in the movie is when soldiers had been trained; the scene came in flashbacks, poorly organized, making other movie more boring. If you are fan of Hollywood survival movies and is not Turkish, don't take a chance to waste your 2 precious hours of your life on it."
" What a Crap - eagerly suggested by friend whose good-movie-sense is doubted now.

" very bad
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,1,Very bad copy of james ryan and muslims shown as enemies in a turkish film...? somehow more propaganda than a movie.
" A true disappointment.
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,4,"I watched this movie expecting great, if not necessarily sublime, things from it, and got a very pedestrian product, neither truly awful nor particularly good. My problem is that, to avoid spoilers, I hadn't read the reviews beforehand and therefore didn't note the obvious ballot-stuffing that IMDb's algorithms were apparently too unsophisticated to catch. The upshot is that I got a movie that was nowhere near meeting any expectations of quality. As nationalist/propaganda pieces go, it's average. It's no worse about that than many other movies. However, the ridiculous overrating has, at least for me, the opposite effect than the voters intended -- rather than elevating Turkish cinema, they've effectively left me suspicious of any ostensibly high-rated Turkish movie. If this particular movie is the apex of Turkish cinema, I have no particular drive to see any others. Indeed, thanks to the bad taste left in my mouth over the difference between expectations and reality, I'm likely to literally pick any other country's movies over Turkish ones right now.The movie itself was fairly standard. Lots of jingoism, the near-deification of the military in question, and some decent cinematography. But nothing special, and certainly nothing that rates remembering for more than a few minutes after it's over. If I'm going to watch ultra-nationalist fantasies, I'd just as soon watch ones with better budgets and production values."
" Best story and powerful action.
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,10,Mostly action based movies ahave many errors in script but this i must say is an accomplished action base movie. Turks know how to impress the audience
" Great Watch!
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,10,"Fantastic writing, brilliant production, careful selected cast - a well crafted masterpiece!"
" Now there is Turkeywood -Mountain II A Movie of Cliches
",2019-04-15 00:00:00,2,"Hollywood, Bollywood now Turkeywood. Do NOT be fooled by the high rating of this film, they have to be written by Turkish Botts.
If you want to wast a few hours watch the remake of Magnificent seven instead-far superior.
Mountain II does not capture the feeling of comradeship but uses token phraes used a thousand times. This has little to do with war, Patriotism,values but has a lot to do with a weak attempt at entertainment.
A must miss"
" Bad copy of Saving private Ryan
",2019-04-12 00:00:00,5,Idea of this film is copied from Saving Private Ryan. Its good movie in general but 9.5 rating come on? I'll rate something between 5.5-6
" A lying film
",2019-03-05 00:00:00,1,It is a film that does not reflect the truth. That's why I gave you 1 point.
" A Complete Masterpiece
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,10,"In some reviews there is no propaganda film like scattering or something like the band of brothers or the saving private ryan blowing or not like the film, but if you look at this movie with neutral eyes very good quality according to my works if you behave neutral imdb just takes the place it deserves but they always the films that praise the Jews for being biased will always be up and such quality films will not be able to enter the list."
" Thousands may come, but this one will stand!
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,10,"Firstly, I don't follow the native language. So some of the comments in my review are based on the subtitles.I'm obliged to write this review because of the way it moved me. This is a classic movie reminiscent of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Pianist"". Overwhelmed by the rawness of the script and its picturisation yet cannot help but notice the preparation gone behind making this movie on the hindsight. It leaves you amazed with three things for sure; storytelling, compelling performances and dialogues. Specially the dialogues are so well written and scripted to the story that it plays emotionally with you no matter where you are from.One of those best movies that will be a war classic in the coming years and truly a well deserving and an amazing movie experience.Kudos and a big thumbs up + 5 stars to the cast and crew."
" Fantastic
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,10,One of the best war type movie ever I seen. Totally awesome Movie.
" Seriously?
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,3,"High rating of this film might be justified if you are 12 years old with a hard on for war, but apart from decent photography and nice places for hiking, this in nothing but hard-core propaganda for military."
" Thouroughly enjoyable.
",2018-12-19 00:00:00,7,"An excellent film, just sit back and enjoy. It's not incredibly complex not as if it's going to win best foreign film at the Oscars. It's just an enjoyable action film. Basically modern Turkish version of ""Seven Samurai/The Magnificent Seven"" with ""Behind Enemy Lines"" thrown in, no worse a movie for it. Great camaradarie between the characters, good story, good movie. 7/10"
" A Good War Movie
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,7,"The movie has all qualities of a good war movie. Good action, humanity, compassion and dirty side of war. The action scenes are well executed. It's like you are watching a fighting scene from an actual footage.It's the stories of heroes who don't give up for their country or for humanity. One of the good war movies in recent times."
" great screenplay, best war movie
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,9,"The detailing, the editing is superb, it keeps you wait till the end, the storytelling is very interesting, the slowness which some people will find boring is the charm of the movie for who really like to watch a good film, all the actors have given great performance,a must watch movie for all"
" Just a Propaganda Movie, Nothing More!
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,1,"It is an overrated propanganda movie, that's all !!
This movie is a part of image work, suported by Turkish government and they spent huge money for marketing and image makers.
In the movie Turkish army rescue a village from ISIS, in real world it's exactly opposite. Please do not be fooled by such tricks.This is not the 1st propaganda movie and it will not be the last one. Just be aware of the truth.."
" Total cheese balls!
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,3,"I had great expectations of this film when I saw the IMDB score, but it is one of the cheesiest films I have ever seen. Certainly not worth watching again, and definitely not worth a score over 5/10."
" A very slow movie
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,6,"I can't believe this movie has the rating of 9+, yes the shooting and the acting is very good but it's a movie without a soul in it.
Very slow movie.
I guess 1:50h would be great for this motion."
" What???
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,2,All i can say is if Turkey could vote for Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest it'd get top marks regardless if it sang a classic or The Birdy Song 🤣😂 10/10 🤔🤔 don't make me laugh.
" Do not watch if not interested!!
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,10,Its pretty funny to see those comments which claims this movie is an propaganda..I highly recommend you guys to don't watch it because you won't get it anyway...
" Oh my word!
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,1,"Fake reviews for sure I mean COME ON PEOPLE! 
A 10 across the board? You could have at least made it SEEM believable. Shame on you. This movie was boring, nowhere near 10. Turkish propaganda, couldn't keep my attention. I rated it a 1 for the shamefulness. In reality its probably a 3.5 maybe a 4."
" Heroes
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,10,One of the best movies I've ever watched.The Turkish military is the toughest army that has helped people who have been in trouble throughout history. courage to the enemy fear gives confidence to the friend. you will not regret watching.
" Unque in war films
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,10,"This film is really a movie worth 10 points. Especially the success of the battle scenes. It's a movie that has managed to capture original scenes in so many war movies. They also go back and are extremely successful in emotional scenes. Can we look at a click high at ""dag 3""?"
" Watch If you are interested...
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,6,"Not a very great movie. The sniper shooting sequence(s) are good. But too much flash back stuffs, sometimes it's hard to follow the play. The actors are not well experienced in acting and especially reactions. I don't still understand the purpose of Nabat's character played by Açelya Özcan. I think she is just an eye candy for the viewers..."
" The most fake reviewed movie on IMDb.
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,1,"I was going through all the 9+ rated movies on IMDb and i bought this one along with several others with high ratings. I couldn't be more disappointed. I shocks me how the people behind this movie or its distribution blatantly and shamelessly decided to fake reviews to boost this movie on IMDb. A lot of time was spent here by most likely a group of people to create new accounts with only one review ever posted and it just happens to be for this movie here. I think IMDb needs to investigate the legitimacy of the reviews posted for this title. It shouldn't be hard for them to notice that something isn't right. The overall score by itself is exceedingly misleading as to the below mediocre quality of the movie itself; shallow storyline and nothing special about anything else. Definitely not what i've come to expect from a 9+ rated movie on IMDb. Steer away from this one fellas, and save your time and money (except to expose this fraud by writing an honest review)."
" Overrated? YES, Bad movie? NO
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,6,"Soooooooooo let's talk about this movie... I think like many of viewers I got catfished by the 9/10 rating. Let's be clear on that, it does not deserve it. SCENARIO : 5/10 - Zero risks.First of all, the scenario. Dag 2 applies the same rhythm than most of the war movies. It starts with a simple mission justifying the presence of the characters in the area (first part of the movie), then an event occurs that will make us wonder how the characters are going to react (second part of the movie), finally the characters made a decision and there comes the big battle we have been waiting for (last part of the movie) where we wonder if the characters will survive. This is the common ""cliché"" on how to build a war movie but that does not imply that every movie following this structure will be a bad movie. For instance, ""Black Hawk down"" follows the exact same structure and still have been rated 7,7/10. MESSAGES: 6/10 - Not original but at least it isn't just a ""Boom, Boom"" movie.We have been talking about the 3 parts of the movie in the scenario but there is actually a fourth part. Indeed, scattered across the whole movie, this part deals with the story of the three main characters (the commander and two soldiers). What is their shared history? Why did they join the special forces? How did they join those special forces? We also have the usual thoughts of every war movies (sacrifice, fallen comrades, follow the mission or follow your heart?). Again, those subjects are pretty common in a war movie. 
However, a good point about this movie is that it doesn't make the mistake of forgetting about the main characters suffering in a war: the civilians. The issue in my opinion is that bringing the civilian issue into a ""one sided"" movie automatically brings a kind of propaganda feeling simplifying a war conflict into a fight between good and evil. It might be naïve from me to think that it is possible to avoid that however I always keep in mind the example of ""Kingdom of Heaven"" which is as far as I know the movie proving that it is possible in a way. ESTHETIC (camera and soundtrack): 7/10Not gonna fully develop this part. Let's just say it is simple and effective even if you see that the flash of the rifles has been added post filming. For the soundtrack, it is the usual orchestral ones coupled with more recent ones. GENERAL OPINION: 6/10""Dag 2"" is not a great movie. Everything is pretty common in that movie which did not manage to surprise me. Also, and that is purely subjective, this movie does not give any explanations on the conflict which is bothering me a lot. Indeed, this movie could have been a great opportunity to explain to the world the Turkish view on that war. After the movie, I had the feeling you could just replace the Turkish insignias by American insignias, it would not impact the movie at all. Also, by applying the usual ""cliché"" to the characters, it is difficult to really care about them since you saw a lot of those personalities die in other movies. Therefore, does that mean ""Dag 2"" is a bad movie? NO! I have seen a lot of comments giving a 1/10 rate for that movie just because it was overrated (and it was). In my opinion, those comments are mistaking. If you look just at the movie, you will see a pretty decent war movie following the common standards. Therefore when you rate that movie you are rating the whole war movie genre. ""Dag 2"" is a decent movie, do not reschedule anything in your agenda to watch it because it will not surprise you however, if you just want to spend some time in front of your TV, watch it.
Finally, I must conclude on two positive points about that movie. The first one was the ability of the movie to manage the silence. This is in my opinion the most difficult challenge. Without silence, you just have a succession of actions, you don't have time to really develop the characters' personality (even if ""Dag 2"" took the time for that, it still failed me on that part XD) and at the end you just have a ""Boom, boom"" movie. The second good point is that, to be completely honest, I never saw a Turkish movie it its entirety. ""Dag 2"" was the first one and I think that is a good achievement that will make me keep an eye on future productions. There we go guys, I hope this review has been usefull!"
" Huh, the highest rate on IMDB?
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,1,"With the highest rate on IMDB, I was expecting a really good movie. But it is not. Sadly, how could this 9.4/10 at this time..."
" The action is impressive, the acting is solid, the direction is first class, the special effects are brilliant and the cinematography awesome.
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,10,"I saw this without seeing the first part but still i thoroughly enjoyed this film. At times the flashbacks were a bit confusing but as the film progressed, i understood everything.
The action is impressive, the acting is solid, the direction is first class, the special effects are brilliant and the cinematography awesome. I dont kno the names of the actors but all of em did a terrific job.
The film is very realistic n u feel the tension once the enemy surrounds the elite commandos. In fact the acting of the entire commando team was so good n convincing that i felt sad for each one of em after they get surrounded.
Basically the plot is a bit similar to Saving private Ryan but this film is more about patriotism n protecting homeland rather than invading another country.
This film is more about risking lives for a principle, more about protecting one's countrymen even if those countrymen are against u.
The explanation by the team leader to his fellow commando on saving the journalist was top notch. Even the contents of the letter which the team leader gives to the journalist was very well done."
" Don't waste your time fellas, it is literally a propaganda movie

" Don't bother
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,1,Wish i had listened to the advise and stayed away. Movie is mediocre at its best.
" it deserves 8 stars
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,8,I am turkish and I am going to be honest with you guys. Its does not deserve 9.5 stars obviously. But it deserves at least 8 stars. I see some comments that could mislead you. Its not as good as some people think and its not as bad as some say
" It's ok
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,6,"It's not brilliant but it is good, what's wrong with patriotism? I imagine it's not based on any true story or facts but it does show how soldiers think and feel. It looks like a remake of Tears of the Sun in many respects, I enjoyed this for what it is !! Entertainment nothing more and nothing less, Turkish film makers take bow !! Well done good job and film ..."
" Movie is crap
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,1,Don't waste your time. Horrible special effects...horrible writing...horrible acting.
" A total waste of time ....
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,1,I am use to give a lot credit to imdb score.... but what was that???? This movie is not worth of a review ... A low budget propaganda with wrong messages .... Stay away or get ready to lose some time of your lige for nothing ...
" Sublime!
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,10,"I praise the men and women of this magnificent testament to the best of what it means to be human-the actors, the director, everyone who made this film a reality, and the great human beings-all of them-who inspired it; in this we feel, deeply, our common humanity, love, and the truest ""meaning of life."""
" Best fake rated movie ever!
",2018-07-11 00:00:00,1,"This is my first review on IMDB and i'm writing this because i cannot tolerate how come this boring, plain, stupid movie getting overrated by fake voters. don't get fool yourself by it's ratings."
" What the hell?
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,3,The acting is sophomoric and the writing is even worse.One can only surmise that the high ratings submitted came from Erdogan fans.
" Jingoistic but robust action drama
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,6,"A Turkish action war film; A story about two friends who set out to rescue a journalist who has been kidnapped by a terrorist organization. This is a thrilling sequel to The Mountain (2012) and has some great locations and beautiful landscapes. It has messages about justification for a Greater Turkey and the need turkey to defend Turkish people living across arbitrarily drawn borders. Sadly, the finale is all too familiar, like the ending of Saving Private Ryan nut overrall it is a solid movie with some good acting and good combat sequences."
" Well-produced propaganda
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,5,"Before you watch this film you have to understand that it is propaganda. But then, if your honest, you'll be hard pressed to name a war film that isn't. This particular example is of the sort ""well-produced"". But production values, no matter how good, can't help the mediocre writing that simply doesn't hold-up under the nonlinear storytelling technique."
" Awful
",2018-06-16 00:00:00,1,This movie was horrible please don't bother with it.
" Corrupted ratings
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,1,IMDB should block the ratings of this movie. It's obviously not worth the current average rating.
" Rubish

" Turkey
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,10,It is an incredible film. You should watch it.
" Fake score
",2018-06-05 00:00:00,3,"This movie, well, definitely not a 9.5 that's for sure. But I have to give some credit to all those (probably Turkish) voters that made sure it got some attention. 
I don't know what irritated me more, the unbelievable over the top heroic and patriotic behavior of the soldiers or the bad script, the very bad camerawork, the slow pace, I could go on for a while. My advice: only watch it if you have to."
" Good effort
",2018-06-04 00:00:00,7,"Pretty much mash Saving Private Ryan, 13 Hours and Tears of the Sun and you get this film. First Turkish film I've ever watched and can't knock it. It certainly doesn't merit either end of the spectrum of up and down votes it has received but it was better than I expected."
" The path to rendition!!!
",2018-06-03 00:00:00,10,Have watched ninety percent of the best war movies ever made by any genre on this planet by the best directors. This movie touched my soul. Although I retired from the Armed Forces in India..I never got an opportunity to take part in live combat. Had to suck in this movie with English subtitles but it kept me on the hook. Do not worry about scumbags who have rated this movie as a matter of propaganda....Just watch it for the raw feeling about what life is all about being in the war front. From the beginning to the end....It gives us an insight into the atrocities of war and how lives are changed not only for those who are thrust into it by sheer love for their country but also for those lives falling in between enemy lines. Never seen the first part of this edition ....Well I don't have to!!!! Just watch it not for the love of cinema...but for it's raw form and never forget to give a rating.
" It worth watching tbh
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,8,"I don't know why most of the commenters are upset about the ones who rated it 10/10. It is a good movie the action is actually pretty good the story is nice. Yah it doesn't deserve a 10/10 it deserves 8/10 in my opinion. Just because it's not an America movie the ratings should be low. I liked the movie. Whoever is reading this you should definitely watch it for yourself and decide, stop listening to the haters :) and enjoy a good damn movie."
" Amazing
",2018-05-30 00:00:00,10,Great movie and great cast. The story is about the special forces life dinamics. Two main charecter is so different guys but love of homeland connects them like brothers. Shortly movie says every Turk born a soldier.
" Something smells fishy
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,1,"Not worth 9+ stars, not even worth 2. People who came here because of the rating, don't bother watching. It's a waste of time folks, go do something else"
" Total Waste of Time
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,1,"With rating more than 9, I expected to see a unique movie, an outstanding acting, an out-of-this-earth novel, and a brilliant directing. None of that is there, NONE, nothing, zippo, null. 
I do not believe I've wasted 2 hrs 15 mins on this absurd, funny military propaganda. I gave it 3/10, and I am being generous here."
" Propaganda?
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,9,"I cannot deny the fact that the movie is based on traditional Turkish heroism, which might not appeal to people from different countries at all.However, I just can't understand why people are obsessed with its being Turkish propaganda. If it's an Italian military film, it will propagate the facts from the Italian point of view. If it's Brazilian, you will see a Brazilian interpretation of the world.Why the heck do you all people accept the American propaganda imposed to you in all genres of films including horrors or cartoons?... The good guys are always Americans, they are the strongest, they care, they are always right... Why don't you question this? Stop being a sheep."
" Is it a parody from Saving Private Ryan?
",2018-03-14 00:00:00,4,"Copy from Saving Private Ryan. Turkish version and a little bit new but thats all, not better."
" Good movie, now how about some truth
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,7,"A very well made, directed, and acted movie considering it's source. For such heroics thouh i'd like to see something about Armenia. What about that? Slaughter any Armenians lateky?"
" Emotional,Gripping and Full of valor !
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,10,"This is the first turkish movie i have ever seen and this became one of the best war movies i have ever seen.Hands down to the director for his amazing screenplay and production values,No wonder this movie has top imdb ratings.I loved the way director showed the valor of the soldiers.The soldiers in the movie were just fighting for their motherland and its people.Religion and Sectarian supremacies were neatly avoided which would have spoiled the mood of the movie.All the actors acting was realistic.I being an indian watched the movie with subtitles and wondered if i knew the language i would have had the better connection.Hope the movie has many sequels !"
" Meh
",2018-02-08 00:00:00,6,"If you are not Turkish probably you will not like it. It is not a 10 or 1 as everyone has mentioned before. It's just a mediocre movie that has partly beautiful acting, especially the Turkoman girl's performance, mostly militarist propaganda, bad script and bad scenario. Go and watch das boot or paths of glory if you want to watch military movie"
" Emotional waterfall
",2018-01-27 00:00:00,10,"Unlike hollywood, this movie is made of a real situation, without making people heroic, invincible or godlike, this movie explains about what's happening with turkmen people as simple as it is. A very good example of brotherhood, love and righteousness. Young generations has to watch and learn. Turkish cinema is new to war movies, so of course there are some continuity issues, bad effects and low quality fight scenes, but unlike foreign movies, I prefer real feelings and emotions rather than effects. And this is what you will find in this movie.. thanks to all those who spent effort to make this movie happen! best regards"
" Moving indeed
",2017-12-04 00:00:00,2,"... to the history's bucket that is!I had to see it, because of the incredible mark, and what a disappointment it was. The more you see, the more unbelievable it becomes, the story is 4-year old-ish, the lines are as subtle as a pin in your toes, the acting is under your average Venezuelan telenovela, and it get's worse still. But hey, if this is for the audience of the Turkish army propaganda and potential recruit pool, I feel there is a lot of improvement of the real army.By the way, I can't digest a lot of the Hollywood war productions, but this can't stand the comparison of poorer Chinese, Indonesian, even Indian, or Egyptian peers.To contradict myself in the end, I don't expect you will not be disgusted with it, just that within a day, you will not be able to tell something dignifying about Dag2, only the beautiful scenery and the potential violence, youtube inspired, but even that poorly staged.A movie to kill."
" Military Propaganda
",2017-12-01 00:00:00,1,"I think it is nothing but a propaganda movie just like the worst WW II and Vietnam films. The play has some effort, but the story is awful in my opinion. I know I'm not an expert in movies plays or acting, but after watching the movie to its end I ended up with confusion. It seems to me there is no point in the whole story but to tell incidents about supposed heroes, helping other supposed heroes, to be announced as heroes. I just hated it."
" Another movie used for propaganda purpose
",2017-11-29 00:00:00,1,"Cannot give a vote,even if as an action movie,cause unfortunately,i worked years in beautiful Turkey,for a company,very ,very close to the Turkish boss.As previously ""Fehti"",about the conquest of Costantinople by the Ottomans,again,it ks so very clear this is a regime propaganda movie. Oh yes...tney are like Amerikans...and they use films for same purpose. A Tyrant propaganda. It can even be dangerous for me to say this,as,i might have to go back to Turkey for work...or possibly i will find not easy,cause i just try to admit what is so clear to all,even all Turkish people,whom i dearly love,as persons and culture,but,they now found almost impossible to react to a tirranical state...and Europe and USA(but...what can they do...???..or do they want to?)does not do anything to help the 50-60% of Turkish people to react.We did nothing against the fake golpe,we are doing nothing in front at so many normal people,especially people like us,here,commenting movies,intellectual people....no reaction,cause there; int will mean,loose it all..at least. It is totally European and United Nation fault to let a great nation,be pushed back again,and again.As United Nation did with Sri Lanka,when the Tamil went completely destroyed,raped,one by one,when the Ceylonese strike to the Tiger,but ,we as United Nation went away,lettin gruesome - kept on phone video cold blood murder,happening in that country,and i was also there,at that time,for the same job... Shame on us,shame on humanity,shame on me that i still review movies... after this. Thanks."
" The Mission
",2017-11-04 00:00:00,8,"A Turkish elite military squad commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Veysel Gökmusa (Murat Serezli) is assigned to rescue the Turkish journalist Ceyda Balaban (Ahu Türkpençe) that was kidnapped by rebels in Iraq. They succeed in their assignment but along their return journey they stumble upon a Turkish village that will be invaded soon. Veysel and his team live a dilemma: to accomplish their rescue mission or to defend the defenseless Turkish villagers. ""Dag II"", a.k.a. ""Mountain II"", is an excellent Turkish film with the storyline of a secret military squad in a mission called ""Storm Bringer"" with the objective to rescue a Turkish journalist from Iraq. The soldiers are submitted to a tough training program but they become like a brotherhood. The non-chronological screenplay entwines past and present but for people like me that have not seen the first film, have difficulties to understand parts of the flashbacks. In addition, the lack of knowledge of the Turkish culture and the ethnic conflicts in that area makes difficulty for the viewer to understand the big picture. But ""Dag II"" is a great action film with feelings and should be nominated to the Oscar. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available"
" 13 Hours meets Tears of the Sun
",2017-11-03 00:00:00,6,"The mountain II is a military and nationalistic portrayal of a group of soldiers on a mission to rescue a kidnapped Turkish journalist in Iraq. At first scene, she's rescued from ISIS and all her kidnappers are terminated. The operation is successful and they should return back home. But, they receive the news that conflicts between terrorist and other groups is blocking their way. They are determined to defend the last Yazidi village against the terrorists and that's where the climax of the movie comes. At one point, the captain announces an Iraqi village as Turkish homeland and raises their flag there, while waiting for the last standing, ""the storm"", against the terrorist ISIS group who are about to attack the village at the afternoon. The movie is full of proud patriotic lessons. This is the main reason why this movie is rated so highly. It would give a Turk, chills alongside the good film score it has. The movie has some cons to it. It is very slow for a military mission and action movie, and too violent for a drama movie. The movie goes back to the past of the soldiers a lot. In conclusion, a well-directed and well-made Turkish movie. The acting is very good. It's worth to watch, even only with subtitles. 6.5/10"
" An overestimated film
",2017-10-31 00:00:00,6,"After seeing the high score and the abundance of people who scored the film, I curiously downloaded and watched the film. However, I didn't get touched after that. In my own perspective, this film is totally overestimated. It was just like the Turkish ""Saving Private Ryan"", except for its mediocre story. At the beginning of the film, the details are great: the time between pulling the trigger and the head shot; killing the moving targets; the individual weapons; the scenes of explodes. However, at the ending, it became careless. The model tank and the shifts of scenes form explosions, which made me consider whether the film crew was that poor. The last battle seemed to be unrealistic, which was a dozen of soldiers fighting against hundreds of terrorists, but since it was a movie which expressed the patriotic theme and self- sacrifice of soldiers, I could accept it.The thing is that the development of the story is so confusing. This film uses two story lines, one is the rescue task, the other is the training process. This method can be interesting, but every time when I wanted to continue watching the story, it was always unexpectedly interrupted by another story line, which made me lose the focus. The story was still an old class: soldiers were ordered to save a reporter who was going to be persecuted by terrorists. When they were going to return to their base, a village consisted with elders, children and women was threatened by the terrorists. After some conflicts, the soldiers decided to save them. The other line of training showcased the toughness of those trained soldiers, the scars in their minds and the real life they need to deal with, which should be touching, but it made audience(or at least me) feel nothing(maybe because I didn't watch the ""Dag Ⅰ""). The characters are also, well, not annoying, but someone I didn't like. The reporter, who was rescued but blamed those soldiers all the time, really made me wordless. She didn't even realize the life of others and always wanted to be the one who would save the world. At some moments, I really hoped that she was killed by the terrorists. The soldiers, however, were much better. Though it still followed the traditional story that someone had to die to save others, due to the link with their relatives and life, it did moved me somehow. But it still couldn't make up the weak story.Except for the partially brilliant details, provoking musics and the eligible battle scenes, this overestimated-patriotic military film is totally not worth watching."
" Far better than other Turkish films
",2017-10-28 00:00:00,9,"A new breath of Turkish cinema, a new source of hope. The unforgettable scenes in Hollywood quality and carefully written script. Intelligent dialogues followed by pleasure and fast flowing scenes."
" Fantastic Turkish Movie!
",2017-10-13 00:00:00,9,This is a really good film. I'd like that. It's made with a very high- quality product. That was one of the most successful military films I've ever seen. Emotional content was included in this film absolutely. I hope you will sign better works. We will be proud again as Turkey. Turkey is with you. Congrats..
" Turkish Special Forces kick butt!
",2017-10-03 00:00:00,5,"As an American with no knowledge of Turkish SF I wasn't sure what to expect of this 'war movie' but it was a very pleasant surprise. Turkish soldiers go into Iraq to rescue a journalist. If this 'plot' sounds familiar its because it is; very similar films have been made before Bravo Two Zero with the SAS, and Tears of the Sun with the US Navy Seals. This movie had great battle scenes, heroic soldiers, heroic women, it rivaled any Hollywood film I've seen on the subject--very well done."
" This does not deserve a 9 or a 10
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,1,"The movie has poor planning, to showcase what soldiers went through. the time line arrangement is poor. that sniper is a copycat from saving private Ryan. This film all seems like Turkish propaganda film to me. It dramatize the life of the soldiers too much. And the amount of reviews that that came from turkey for this film. Obviously there is a biased side of this film."
" 100.000 up votes and 50 reviews. Do not trust this.
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,3,"Movie is pure propaganda and the current reviews are just not right at all. There is just not a good reason for this movie to be so up voted. So yes it has his moment, drama, some good ideas and the fighting can be really intense. But all in all this movie is surely not a master piece. This has been the most seen movie in 2016 in Turkey but honestly I do not see how that can be a movie who get so high rated. Smells fishy."
" This is a great Turkish film!
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,10,"As I mentioned in the title, the film is simply wonderful.I do not know where to start, but I need to start somewhere, do not I? My first eye pain in this movie. Because for the first time I watched a Turkish movie in the movie theater. I also got the opportunity to watch this movie in the movie theater. The film was superb with one word.The message that this filmin has given is a very deep link. There are soldiers who have opened their lives for the people you've never met and these soldiers are Turkish soldiers.Brotherhood, friendship, love, oath, history, war, enmity words could not be explained so beautifully.I loved the land I lived after this film more. If you need to talk briefly about your movie;DAG II; tells the story of a clandestine special forces squad; call sign 'Storm Bringer'. Following of the first film, Bekir and Oğuz, best friends, have in the world famous, perpetually grueling Turkish special forces training. Their first mission begins to infiltrate the most barbarous area of modern day Iraq for a rescue mission. The film briefly describes the hostage-taking hostage operation on the country border. This operation is so ingeniously processed that it is not surprising to get it.The film has transitions between past and future. So that the questions in your mind are wiped out in a flurry.I did not get rid of it for a while after watching this movie. I would always be a soldier at home. A lot of laughs, plenty of cry and a lot of swearing films are waiting for you Let me know how to prepare chips and watch the movie right away. Because you miss a lot. Finally this movie is real!"
" Disappointing
",2017-09-01 00:00:00,4,"Ideological plot, awkward acting, bad music and above all everyone is a darn hero? The only way this mediocre film got such a rating on IMDb is because the voters are almost all nationalists of sorts and got goosebumps watching a fairytale of a movie of their black and white, primitive understanding of the world."
" Out of Range
",2017-08-31 00:00:00,10,I had to confess that I did not believe Turkish film industry could make such a good movie. I enjoy the every moment while I was watching it. All the feelings pass through to me which might be the hardest part of making movies. Of course there were some minor mistakes however I guarantee that It is one of a kind like the best Hollywood movie. Everyone not even Turkish will enjoy the movie for sure.
" 6,5
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,6,"Basically good story. It shows a lot about the special forces. And it is excellent patriotic movie. For this two things i give 9... But...The Writter stole a lot of scenes and phrases from probably five or six war or action movies, worldwide. Saving private Ryan (dozen of scenes), magnificent seven,band of brothers , tears of the sun, even one scene from Walter defends Sarajevo (our Yugoslav-Bosnian movie). Because of all this thing movie deserve rate 4, not more. I'm sincerely disappointed"
" Imitation
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,2,"It is a poor imitation of Hollywood war movies. Visual effects are good but there is nothing unique about this movie. The characters are flat, the plot is ideological, which tries to legitimize Turkish intervention in Iraq and Syria. Through poor dialogues and conflicts between the reporter and soldiers the message is that Turkish army must save those poor people. The story is very weak. Firstly, a special squad aims to saves a Turkish news-reporter, but later they decide to save a village in which there are a bunch of people. Instead of risking everybody, why do not they take the villagers with them or hide in some place?"
" The best movie taking you inside the struggle at the borders of Turkey
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,10,"This movie gives you a unique opportunity to see how soldiers struggle against extremists at the borders of Turkey. In terms of the plot, the movie has everything that viewers would want from a movie of its genre. The director weaves the touching personal stories of the soldiers with the harsh realities of performing military work. The outstanding combination of action and emotion in this movie will be interesting for everyone (not only for viewers from Turkey.)"
" waste of time
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,1,"Everything is so bad; script, acting, realism are so so bad. Turkish special forces overrated again like other Third world army's forces. I think young Turkish people from face book organized and rated 10. Worst copy of cliché video films. Deserve garbage... Go and read a book instead..."
" Moving.
",2017-05-05 00:00:00,10,"For those who criticize the story, well i have bad news for you. This movie is never been about a story telling. It's about showing the people what are Turks doing, what are they thinking about surroundings, how they react in these kind of situations.If you expect a fairy tail then you should watch some American.This is a slice of life of the people who living in these areas. While you were drinking your coffee and watching the movie, the people you see in the movie they are dying.FOR REAL..We are, Turks, actually doing something for them.What are you doing other than criticizing and complaining?"
" Awful Film
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,1,"Really really awful film;İf you ever watched Nefes film,that's also better than this film.First of all dialogues in the film are really further from the reality and also poem reading sniper;if you know a little bit about sharp sniping,you will guess you need to hold your breath to hit perfectly.İf you talk while you sniping,you can miss; exc. a lot of ridiculous and hilarious things in the film at least this film is the copy of some Hollywood films."
" Pathetic boring propaganda film
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,1,"This film was amazingly boring. I just finished watching it and it was painful. Bad Acting, bad directing, bad filmaking in general. The scenario was a joke, the story was not realistic at all. It reminded me of soviet propaganda army films but with a Turkish twist.The only reason I watched it was because it had almost a perfect score in IMDb, but that also is fake apparently like the film is a cheat and it cheated me of my precious time watching such garbage."
" You'll Feel all the emotions that Hollywood does not have.
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,10,"Don't forget all the weapons in the movie are made in Türkiye. and its all real guns used in the movie. and one of the difference between Mountain 2 and the other Hollywood made action movies is , mountain 2 is not supernatural. there is no fantastic rescues. its all real. teeth to teeth blood to blood. and my favourite line in the movie is "" this is not a American movie, there will be no one to save us at the end of movie... "" ( Thanks to TSK for support this movie..... )"
" Reflects the Turkish people I know very well, however the movie has some minor flaws
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,10,"I cried while watching the movie, I would like to admit that. The way that the movie flashbacks to the lives of the soldiers and their inner selves was fascinating. Especially the quality of the side stories were impressive. They were so realistic. However the part where the special forces soldiers decided to sacrifice themselves for the village raised some questions. It sounded a bit like cliché hero movie. Other than that the director has no problems with killing heroes, which defeated the cliché a little bit. The CGI was relatively weak, and also the camera angles and shot transitions felt a little weird. I believe the strongest part of the movie was the side stories also the conversations between the soldiers. I heard some music from Kaan Tangoze (the vocalist of Duman) in the movie. I listened to his songs through all my high school years. There were also some political messages inside the movie. It was mainly about freedom of speech and press. I felt so much connection with the movie."
" Awesome
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,10,"This movie first time supported from Turkish Armed Forces. If you don't understand subject this movie watch first movie named The Mountain.Effects and actings is awesome! Don't be late , watch it and learn! You will not regret it never.A person die , thousand people are born!"
" Don't waste time
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,4,"When someone sees 9.9 score on IMDb of course the person wants to watch that movie. But i say don't waste your time for this one. The screenplay and the dialogues are really awful. I wonder how it's got this score. There can be two options Turkish patriots can be voted 10 without thinking. And the other one is they opened account just to vote this movie. They couldn't create a deepness in character's psychology and because of that when they shows us the situation it doesn't very important for us.Also unlike most of the action films it doesn't aiming something important in the movie time. But cinematography is nice. It must be, because it has a very high budget for a Turkish movie."
" good job
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,10,"one may find exaggerated of the IMDb rate.However, this movie means a lot for Turkish people. i can say as a Turkish patriot we proud of our history and glorious army. although they try to ruin army's reputation the still stand like a mountain. this movie and my expectations met precisely my vote 10/10"
" Masterpiece
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,10,"It s been really hard to make this kind of action film in Turkish cinema industry. There was only one ""FETIH"" which explains Ottoman history and İstanbul conquer.. But DAG 2 will be the masterpiece. You can understand how Turkish military get the war with terrorists. Also it s a good example how Turkish military uses its power for the poor people."
" Should watch this movie just because to show soldiers who fight against terrorists.
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,10,"Well yeah i have just watched it and all i can say is good movie according to average of other Turkish movies.I will not say it is undoubtedly perfect but it is a good movie.For all of us there must be some reasons to watch movies.It changes from person to person but for this movie you all should go and watch the movie. Why ? Because Turkish army really needs to see that all world is behind them .They are fighting with terrorists. We lost many of our soldiers. And this movie was supported by Turkish General Staff.Let just go and support their fight morally. They are the protector of all of us.One die,one thousand rises."
" The excellence of the maroon berets
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,10,After serving in the united states army for 19 years i got to admit:Either these actors have been serving the army twice the amount of time i did. Or these actors are natural born killers with their weapons skills. They have taken the role of the maroon berets (which i trained with during the Nato exercises in Germany) very adequately. Nice and realistic i prefer more of these kinds of movies. The more realistic war movies are the better.Of course i gave the ten stars for what Turkey has in movie making. If it were a Hollywood movie i would have given it 10 stars for realism and 7 stars for the special effects.Nice movie with badass soldiers how it's suppose to be!Waiting for the third movie where they show a war on a bigger scale with more of these kinds of soldiers :PAnd to be honest it kinda motivated me to join the Euphrates shield operation as a volunteer but wouldn't feel safe between those Ahrar al sham jihadists lol. They might accidentally hit me with an rpg or something
" Excellent Movie from Turks and Observation of Mixed Soldier Perspective
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Well edited movie was made by Turks at the end of 2016.The demonstration of how local people of Iraq suffer from Isıs's terrorism and how actually they are eager to fight against Isıs if they have had opportunity is really informative and emotional.The cut scenes from past of soldiers with related content of each action scenes interestingly gives understanding of a real soldier perspective on situations ,so it just demonstrates their mixed minds between real-life and soldier-life in Battlefield.It's really well edited to show how soldiers effort to be senseless while they are fighting but they are just human and emotional beings.The fact of usage of real guns and tanks in movie leads to creation of virtual reality in movie. You feel like you are operating with the Turkish Special Force Team.The movie also shows their actual fight against being non-emotional order servant, and shows honorable Turkish emotions on local people of Iraq."
" The Best Turkish Movie Ever Made for Me
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"Spoiler Alert! For careful watchers Iron Maiden is being played in a short section of movie.About the movie, visual effects is considerably over intermediate and the story line, the characters ...Also nature is well chosen. Additionally perfect angles and frames are art-like.It is a well told, objective story.The best part of the movie is for a long period of time i saw a movie without USA propaganda or hidden frames of STAR of David.It is an Hollywood-like movie which is not produced in Hollywood studios but a serious contender....Lastly arms used in the movie are real Turkish Army properties."
" Everything is very beautiful
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,10,"An incredible film not just classic war scenes in the world Actors who have used scenes for the first time have never really He's nice. Films spend an emotional time for war scenes To follow and make happy. The players do not have much better movies, so the movie can be considered as bad. Film and acting. Also, the scenes are sometimes bored I guess. I guess it's for you to breathe a little. Because he is very excited. Have fun Sit back and enjoy the movie.This movie is not just for one nation. So please do not come close to or ignore events that are happening in the world.In the name of people just living peacefully Good looking and good fun"
