" Better than the first one.
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,7,"I find the first movie to be just a straight up worse copy of Cars, Skipper is obviously a copy of Doc, Ripslinger is a bad copy of Chick Hicks and Chug is a dumber and less funny version of Mater ( some of the characters even got the same colors... Same blue for Doc and Skipper, and same green for Ripslinger and Chick.). This second movie tho is unique, I really like how this ties in with the world of Cars while not copying the story of Cars, there are even loads of Easter eggs for Cars fans to find. Like when Mayday shows he got some ""Rust-Eze"" to remove corrosion and rust on his rear bumper and says ""ka-chaw"". And how Mayday has a picture of him and Sarge from Cars in his fire house.IMO it seems like this was the movie Disney actually wanted to make, but couldn't because we didn't know the main character. So they made the first movie only to make us halfways get to know Dusty, then released this right after. It's not perfect, and it's story is certainly very bare boned compared to any Cars movies. But Planes fire and rescue IMO isn't ""bad"". It's absurd seeing ""adults"" complaining in the reviews that the story isn't ""deep enough"" or whatever. Whole point of these kids movies is so it's easy for kids to understand it."
" Planes: Crash & Burn
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,3,It can justify its existence even less than the first one. The main good thing I could say about it is that it felt a lot shorter than it was.
" Better than the first
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,6,"The first film is fine, nothing great. This is a little better, and more enjoyable"
" Better than the original
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,8,"The first Planes movie was a good, solid, family oriented fun time movie. This movie retained all the strengths of the original, but improved on it, with an overall better and more creative story to tell.Once again, a nice theme that explores some new territory -- the life and times of a smoke jumpers and airborne fire fighters. The way the movie integrates personality into each of the characters provides a subtle and yet entirely effective blend of animation and plot.Again, the producers adhered to a well designed animation concept, where the airplanes would remain rigid in those areas where rigidity was necessary to support flight (primarily the wings) but also at no time compromise the basic designs of each plane, which are all rendered accurately -- a refreshing effort given how easy it would have been to just ""wing it"" -- so to speak.For those who love aviation, especially those who are part of it, the movie works on many levels. Yes, there is just enough intrigue to make the story interesting, without once going over the top to becoming preachy. That too is a welcome change of pace from too much of today's Hollywood treatments.Overall, the film is grand family entertainment, and well worth another installment should the producers think it worth their efforts."
" Planes:Fire &Rescue
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,10,"Interesting.After ""Planes"" , this is set in a mountains and forest background. Its has plenty of characters and the story has good pace."
" Meh
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,6,"Not a hatable movie, just a forgettable one.I guess it's not as generic as last time as we see a character go from sports herodom to working alongside real heroes (fires don't care if you flash a badge) but the whole thing just feels kind of sanctimonious.Again, watchable enough for the hotel room but there was no real imperative to make this."
" From race to fire
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,6,"After his success in races, Dusty has a problem with his transmission. This brings him to abandon planes races and become a fireman: if the changing is too fast, the movie manages to give dignity also to this new adventure, that since the first second is thought as a tribute to real firemen. As the first one, there a lot of elements really commons in kids or adolescent movies (friendship strength, happy ending, lasts' revenge etc), and also things recovered from Cars (actant's structure and the idea of a champion linked to a provincial village), but consideringly that's the sequel of a spin-off, I think it could have been really worse. Funny, but you have to delete expectations."
" Enjoyable for kids!
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,5,"Planes its extra, after watching first one that i enjoyed too much, gave this a go to, the movie is enjoyable for kids, cant get adults interest that much, i personally didnt hate and didnt like it that much, the main problem of this movie was its story, it really lacked of the story, so what we are just watching a plane has a cracked gearbox and wants to fix it, and the fire part of the movie was good but at the ending we just didnt know what happened to the fire part they cutted it out why i dont know so it just leaved us there didnt know what happened, and the main thing i liked was its runtime was really short they delivered us a good story, the ending was really early to show up there, the sound track was really good, and we just viewed many scenes on the plane that was great too, i wont recommend it even if you are a animation fan, 5.5/10‚≠ê"
" Needed more action in the first 2/3
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,6,"Quadruple rehashed storylines need action to maintain attention. My 2 year old and I were just bored until the ending picked up pace. Animation is good but a little flat and shortcuts are obvious to a semi trained eye. Better movie than the first, a third might have put all the pieces together."
" My son loves this movie
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,10,"I watch this every day with my toddler, he loves dusty. The opening music credits always warm my heart and remind me of him now.The movie is quite funny and the characters very likeable."
" This is bad
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,3,"This movie feels like it was made by coked-up 1980's studio executives. It hops so frenetically through the first act that there's no chance to get invested in any characters- least of all the douchy main character Dusty, appropriately voiced by Dane Cook. For some reason that's awfully convenient to plot he won't listen to anyone and causes one problem after another. So - why should we care about him? Cuz he's the main character I guess.I seriously didn't care about a single thing that was happening for a single minute of this film.It. Was. Boring.But it was kinda pretty to look at, so there's that."
" A slightly better, but still boring sequel.
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,4,"Sequels to animated movies are common. We typically see one every year nowadays. It's nothing unusual. What is unusual however is releasing a sequel to a movie only a year after the predecessor which is the case for ""Planes: Fire & Rescue"". The first film was released not even a full year before this movie came out, and I was not impressed by it. I found it predictable, lazy and nothing more than a cash grab to the Cars franchise which is to be expected for a film initially intended to be released straight to DVD but was rather released in theaters instead. While this film is slightly better than that first movie, it's still pretty bad and I don't find it recommendable.Dusty Crophoper (Dane Cook) has been having a very successful career racing after winning that race around the world competition in the first movie. However, his racing career is put in jeopardy when his gearbox becomes damaged after being pushed to it's limit. Though that's not the only conflict in the movie. After a fire in his hometown, the airport there is condemned due to not having the proper fire equipment adequacy. Wanting to get his airport back on the map, Dusty decides to become a firefighter to help the airport and flies to a national park to undergo training from a helicopter named Blade Ranger (Ed Harris) as well as his crew. From their on out, the rest of the movie is predictable with ups and downs in terms of plot emotions as well as the many ways the film tries to show children about how park rangers put out fires.At the beginning of the film, there was a nice dedication to all the fire fighters who risked their lives to save others every single day. I'm glad that Disney went out of it's way to make a dedication like this, though I do wish it went to a better movie. Even though the movie is shorter than it's predecessor, it's so boring. The film just dragged on through it's predictable plot lines and added nothing new to give the film emotion. It relies on a lot of unfunny jokes including one scene where it makes puns on ""Howard the Duck"" as well as ""CHiPs"". Yeah, it made a pun on ""Howard the Duck"". That is just ridiculous. I also found the idea of going from a film about racing to fire safety really odd. I do like the idea of teaching children about fire fighters in national parks, but kids should be learning it elsewhere other than ""Planes"". The animation is a step better than the predecessor. Even though I thought the fire effects were pretty good, the animation is still not on quality with the levels set by Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar and once again came off as amateur. The characters are once again bland. The new ones are the same one note personality traits you remember from the first movie and the new ones fit in that same boat. One character played by Julie Bowen really got me irritated me and sometimes disturbed me with her odd personality. The soundtrack also kind of got on my nerves. It mostly consisted of rock songs with one entire sequence blasting the AC/DC song Thunderstruck and I really have no idea why. Also like the first movie, it wastes a talented cast, most notably Ed Harris. I have no idea why in the world an Oscar nominated actor like him would sign on to do this cash grab, but then again, most actors just do it for the money.And I think that's the best way to describe ""Planes: Fire & Rescue"". Made for the money. The story is boring and predictable, the animation while an improvement is still amateur at best, and the characters are once again bland and cliche. I do feel that fire safety is important and teaching kids about fire fighters and their equipment is an interesting idea though I feel there are better movies, TV shows and books to show kids that have done this same concept."
