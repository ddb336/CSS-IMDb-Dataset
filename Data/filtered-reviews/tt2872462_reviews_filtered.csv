" Gerwig great -but needs something to bounce against. Directing pedestrian/ stilted
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,5,"Not really sure of the excellence of the film. Gerwig is, unfortunately in a strange way - so very very good on screen and at occupying her character to the full, that the rest of the cast are left behind in her wake. Which, yes, does reflect the film itself. But this leaves the problem with Kirke, who isn't so all-consuming and isn't allowed (or isn't capable) in the film, to inhabit her full role of observer/recorder. Not allowing other characters to colour-up is the Director's fault. There is a lot of Woody Allen-isms all through the film -and that's not a compliment, because there's so much wrong with Allen's weak films that impersonation of them isn't wise.
The rapping back & forth is very sharp, of course, and we're swept along de-constructing the last smart phrase - when the next one is already at our door. This shows such a lot of thought has gone into the script in rehearsals - but the Director forgot that they have a responsibility to also make a film. The directing suggests they're not a visual artist of any great skill. Definately want to hear more of Gerwig."
" Tracy's Short Story
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,7,The poster for Antonioni's 'Le Amiche' seen on one of the character's walls near the end reveals the inspiration for this romantic comedy charting the shifting relationships among a group of affluent and garrulous young Americans rather reminiscent of Woody Allen and updated to the Facebook generation.
" What is this?
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,2,"Pretentious, coming of age drivel with hollow characters and equally hollow and meaningless script!I could not get my head around this from the first minute to the last no matter how hard I tried; all i can presume is that it is for women only who may get it!
I have never met such vacuous and tedious people like these who talk and act like this - maybe it is an America thing ? who knows. I just know it bored me to tears and I nearly flatlined with the monotony of the verbal diarrhoea that spewed forth from each characters anvs!As for the writer Noah bumbang well i have never heard of him and don't you just love the equally pretentious reviews on here mentioning his previous amazing efforts of which I am also unaware and have seen not a jot of any of them either...thankfully!Noah bumbag is apparently the lovechild of two film critics which tells me everything I need to know NOT to watch any of his ostentatious and pompous but in reality limp and hollow efforts to attain social significance."
" AN ALIEN STORY
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,4,"I was surprised to read that Mistress America is not an autobiographical story or by Noah Baumbach or Greta Gerwig. They simply wanted to create a character that was, in itself, New York and that woke up every day wanting to do more and better things than the day before. On the other hand, the film also seems to want to launch a moral message -at least in the case of Tracy-: we are from where we belong -group of friends- and not from where we want to be -literature club-. However, as the film progresses, the arches of the characters end up being buried by the prominence that Brooke acquires as ""Mistress America.""Why is the protagonist the sister? It is clear that the main character of Mistress America is not Tracy, but the curious Brooke - it is no coincidence that she is also the co-writer of the film. The point is that it is more attractive to show Brooke from someone else's eyes, since any attempt to delve into the character ends up incoherently. An example of this is the film's very long and absurd ""climax"", in which Brooke, Tracy and their friends go to Mamie's house - Claire and Dylan to find investors for the cafeteria. It is so implausible that Brooke gives up her dream of opening a store after exchanging two words with Dylan, such as breaking ties with her stepsister - and that she decides not to tell her until the script needs to give reasons for Tracy to get angry too - only for having written this a story based on it. But isn't Brooke one of those people who likes to be the center of attention? And above all, why, after that, do you decide that the city is not your place? Perhaps I am the one who does not share much with the genre, but I neither understand nor believe most of the film.It is clear that Mistress America works better as a funny superficial phenomenon than as a portrait of a population. It also helps Gerwig look like an actress, an aspect in which there is little to reproach her for. Or maybe a lot. The truth is that it eats the rest of the cast. Her performance is so fluid, natural and improvised - without actually being one - that it makes me suspect that the film is nothing more than a simple means to achieve professional positioning.On the other hand, I also think that the movie may feel different if you live in the New York frenzy. Perhaps in this way you get to savor the social satire that everyone talks about. Hopefully, since, from Spain, the only thing I can say is that it has entertained me only a little"
" Mistress America
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,5,"Written and directed by Noah Baumbach (Greenberg, Marriage Story), I was most interested to see this film because of the lead actress, who has since turned to directing, including hit films like Lady Bird and the remake of Little Women. Basically, Tracy Fishko (Lola Kirke) is a freshman having trouble adjusting to life at Barnard College. She meets and befriends fellow student Tony (Matthew Shear), and develops a crush on him, but when he begins dating another girl called Nicolette (Jasmine Cephas Jones), she feels alone again. Following advice from her mother (Kathryn Erbe), Tracy contacts her soon-to-be stepsister Brooke (Greta Gerwig, also writing), who also lives in New York. Tracy is immediately entranced by Brooke and her lifestyle. Tracy spends more time with Brooke, including crazy nights out, a visit to a psychic and Tony driving them to Connecticut. Brooke has ambitions to open a restaurant and pitches it to her former friend Mamie-Claire (Heather Lind), hoping she will invest. Brooke waits for Mamie-Claire to talk to her husband, Dylan (Michael Chernus). Meanwhile, Tracy is called by her father, who informs her that his wedding with Tracy's mother has been called off. Rather than dismiss Brooke, he asks her pitch the restaurant, and Tracy helps her to do so. He agrees to give her money, but not to invest into the business, to cover debts when it is dissolved. Brooke sees Tracy is upset and the strain on Dylan and Mamie-Claire's relationship, she ultimately refuses the offer. Tracy is humiliated when a short story she had been writing about her experiences is read out loud during a party, and Brooke is offended of her brutal characterisation in it. Tracy informs Brooke that they are no longer about to become sisters, as their parents no longer want to marry. Tracy's story is accepted by the university's prestigious literary society, she joins the group for a while, but eventually leaves it, unable to fit in. Alone on Thanksgiving, Tracy goes to Brooke apartment and finds her packing to move to Los Angeles. Brooke has received a share of money from the T-shirt business that Mamie-Claire stole from her some time ago. Tracy invites Brooke to have Thanksgiving dinner with her. The two eat out at a restaurant, and it seems there may be hope of their friendship continuing. Also starring Dean Wareham as Harold. Kirke is good as the seemingly shy student with ambitions, but Gerwig as the eccentric witty young woman with a desperate need to succeed does almost steal the show, together they make an affable pair who have a few misadventures together. I will be honest that I drift in and out at times, but it does have a good script and some small moments that did make me titter, an alright comedy. Worth watching, in my opinion!"
" Misutoresu Amerika
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,3,"I hated every character in this film, so that's cool"
" the Gerwig show
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,6,"Baumbach comedies are deceptive, always having a sour undercurrent with the humour. This probes into the misery and unpleasantness, of the also comic characters. Gerwig dominates the screen in a 21st century iteration of Holly Golightly from Breakfast at Tiffany's.But what starts as a New York movie turns into a Connecticut road movie. Baumbach gets under the skin of his characters. But the real highlight is Gerwig's stellar performance. And not too far off is Kirke, as her two-faced friend. This film is perceptive, well-written and mostly funny. And mostly hits the spot with the unlikely undercurrent of pathos."
" Coming Of Age Movie. Great Writing. And Also, Greta Gerwig.
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,8,"Aight, what do I have to do to get to hang out with Greta Gerwig like that?"
" Confessions
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,7,"It was strange but too many talks should be quoted.
I was trying to understand the nature of both of main characters: tracy and brook, and the relationship between them. I think I couldn't figure it out clearly. Tracy was a young girl that's on its way to know life, she is confused and doesn't know what to do. Brook was an adult woman who went through many different experiences in her life, and the paradox is that she still doesn't know what to do either.
The relationship between them fixes this somehow, brook feels good about herself in the presence of tracy who in turn considers her as a role model. This exactly what helped both of them.
I think that stroy was based on the idea of confessions. This life is based on confessions..
And being confused is the most reliable feeling you should feel after the movie!"
" I almost smiled once
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,2,"An old style screwball comedy or a modern I Love Lucy? yes, but without the laughs. I find the rave reviews puzzling - a bunch of shouting PC feminists who swear a lot may appear trendy and right-on but I found this film tedious, despite a relatively short running time. If I want to watch a screwball comedy, I shall watch a real one and not a modern pretentious PC feminist lecture."
" In love with ...
",2019-04-01 00:00:00,7,"America ... does she talk a lot? Is this going to be political? Well not really, and especially not as charged as anything you could say right now (2019), where no matter what side you prefer (Dems/Rep), you will likely not hear the others out. So let's leave that behind and maybe when you are reading this, it won't play a role anymore anyway ... let's hope so.Let's take this for what it is. A movie where people talk a lot, make a lot of snarky (funny to some) comments about society, about themselves about relationships about so many other things regarding life ... Now if that sounds like something you have seen one of the leading ladies (Greta) in it - you are not off at all. That is her thing though in this case, there is someone else who plays the very main character. The characters may do stuff that may feel wrong (because they are morally speaking), depending on how much you care also - hopefully that won't muddle the experience for you. Because this is more than decent enough if you like dramas ..."
" Uninteresting at least to me
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,4,"I like Greta Gerwig. I didnt like her in this though. Her wife/husband partnership with the director Noah Baumbach the movies are a little hit and miss and this one was a miss. The endless relentless uninteresting dialogue just did my head in. The mansion scene seemed to go on for eternity. Generally most of the characters were unlikeable. Oh Lola character mom (Kathyrn Erbe) seemed nice. Kinda similar vein to Woody Allen movie without the star names. Greta is a better actress than what she had to work with in this movie. Anyway I wouldnt recommend this one. One plus is that it is short (84 minutes). Another plus point the use of a song I hadnt heard for a while, OMD Souvenoir."
" Cool writing, Good acting, Poor directing
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,6,"Overall I liked this movie. There are moments that just genuinely surprised me, and in a movie world full of tiresome cliches that's always a really really good thing.
 I think the casting was done well. I was surprised to see the blonde actress playing the lead. I don't even know her name, and I'm not going to Google it. But I've seen her in smaller roles and she was much less entertaining. This was a good role for her, she did really well in it.
The problem with the acting was that it was very turn-taking. ""I'll say this this now it's your turn to act."" At many points the acting seemed more like a script reading than actual acting.
Didn't care for the beginning scenes and set up of the movie. It felt rushed and chaotic. Some of the scenes seemed as if they had been shot with a low-end camcorder (specifically dorm scenes). It's not a life-changing film at all. Slight moral lesson included, which always adds value to film. Entertaining."
" Confusing
",2018-02-17 00:00:00,4,"Confusing is the word. You can't see a red tread through the movie, but I like the ""company of the young Yorkers""."
" A great screwball throwback
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,8,"Lola Kirke stars as a young college freshman in NYC who is not having the positive experience she had hoped. Lonely and frustrated, she reaches out to her soon-to-be stepsister Greta Gerwig who lives in NYC. The two go out for a night on the town and Gerwig's manic, social butterfly persona brings excitement into Kirke's existence. This modern screwball comedy has a plot mostly involving Gerwig's attempt to start a restaurant, but is mostly a character piece, bouncing 5 or 6 eccentric characters off each other. I was really enamored with it's eccentricity."
" characters and change-ups
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,9,"A delightful movie as long as you like characters more than plot. Comedy yes, but serious too. The word ""screwball"" appears often in reviews, but this is not screwball: the characters here are real.Much is said about what Brooke brings to Tracy. But one of the revelations (and it's not exactly subtle) is how much Brooke needs Tracy and gains from the friendship. Though much younger, Tracy imbues Brooke with a degree of confidence and a sense of self that Brooke lacked.Much is said about the pace, and it does pack in a lot. But the pace is tightly managed, and when it slows down, the impact is powerful."
" Mistress America, Stay Strange !
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,6,"You know how unique is every human being?! Whole plot is around life and it essence. Life of normal people with their struggles through life. Most of us was there with no aim in life or have too much ambitions! The movie narrate life of this person's. It is unique since every being is unique and since it shows us life without curtains sometimes it is dull sometimes it is harsh. Acting and dialogues are good not amazing and the whole plot does not not bother you and carry you on till the end. The way of filming, Soundtracks and acting are rare this day and make you almost happy if you seek a movie about normal days of people who want to be better in their life. Watch this movie when you are in a mood and you find yourself in it. I think it is a good film and worth watching."
" Everyone I know Dies
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,2,If I knew her I wish I would be dead too. She follows around a person who is very unlikable. In the end you find most of the characters in this movie are very unlikable. I wouldn't want any of them to be my friends. These are people that you here about in college that are only in to them selves. Shame on you for being rich. Shame on you for having morals. Shame on you for having religion. Shame on you for caring about something. They ask questions that mean absolutely nothing about the subject because they think they have some intellectual superiority. Do not watch this movie. Or if you have kids that are going to college. Watch this movie. This is what they will become.
" some funny
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,7,"Tracy (Lola Kirke) is a college literature freshman eager to be in New York. However, she is unable to connect anywhere. She fails to get into the literary society. Tony is her only new friend who also failed to get in. Then he starts dating the possessive Nicolette. Tracy's mother suggests meeting her future step-sister Brooke (Greta Gerwig). Brooke is a self-obsessed over-confident thirty year old pushing to open her own restaurant. Tracy is completely taken and inspired to write a short story based on her.There are some funny stuff as Greta Gerwig goes over the top with her character. It has some poignancy with Lola Kirke until the climatic confrontation. It goes over into farce for a second. Noah Baumbach has the movie building up to a compelling fun emotional resolution. He pushes a little too hard. There needs to be more variation to the characters' reaction. They need to voice their own complaints about Tracy. It also wouldn't hurt if Karen and Harold don't care while talking about themselves. The scene is wrong but it could have been hilarious. Otherwise, there are some good fun laughs to be had."
" A screwball friendship comedy
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,8,"If a theme seems to be emerging out of Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach's collaborations it's that women's friendships are complex, loving and real. Their first collaboration together, Frances Ha, left me cold, but I was completely and utterly charmed by their second, Mistress America. Lola Kirke plays Tracy, an undergrad who is finding it difficult to fit in at university where everyone always seems one step ahead of her. Desperately alone she hesitantly contacts her soon to be step-sister, Brooke, whom she's never met before on her mother's suggestion. Almost immediately she falls for Brooke. Not in a romantic way, but to her Brooke seems the perfect embodiment of everything she wants to be. Wild, passionate, daring, exciting, warm and welcoming. Tracy spends her days being dazzled by Brooke and starts to write a short story about her that she calls Mistress America. Of course Brooke isn't the perfect person she imagines and as the movie goes on the limits of their friendship are uncomfortably tested. I do not particularly like Gerwig as an actress, but she works best here because she's more of a secondary character. Brooke is seen mostly through Tracy's loving eyes but we can see that she's slightly ridiculous and not all she's cracked up to be. Lola Kirke is fantastic as Tracy. The script is slightly uneven but everyone offers just enough crackling energy to make it really work. A delight of a film."
