" Average Comedy with a good premise
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,5,"I liked the premise of the story and the unlikely bond between Ashby and the main lead. It had its funny moments but sometimes I just hated the boy but at the same time he felt like a real person who is too nosy and stupid. 1/2 for the premise and 1/1 for the plot setting.The directing and cinematography could have been better but it was okay. 1/2 The cast did a good job portraying their individual roles and hence 1/2. finally, I give the movie 1/2 as it was not as entertaining as I expected it to be."
" One small tiny detail....
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,1,"Let's discuss the scene with the MRI in the basement. First of all let's get educated on what MRI stands for. It stands for magnetic resonance imaging. Although an MRI does not emit the ionizing radiation that is found in x-ray and CT imaging, it does employ a strong magnetic field. The magnetic field extends beyond the machine and exerts very powerful forces on objects of iron, some steels, and other magnetizable objects; it is strong enough to fling a wheelchair across the room.
So let's take a look at where this MRI machine is placed in the room. Look to the right and to the left and when they pan around. Oh, don't forget what she is holding in her hands and what he is wearing....metal. Turn that machine on and they would be impaled on bludgeoned by all the metal objects in the room (have you seen the movie Twister?). Good grief. Oh, and not even a neurologist would have an MRI in his basement. SMH."
" I'm glad I watched it.
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,10,This movie is soulfood. Its really pretty. I really loved Rourke's depth. His wardrobe was great too.
" Better than expected
",2020-07-16 00:00:00,8,"How many of these movies have been made? Young person. Quirky old person. Heartwarming plot. Sad ending. Pretty formulaic. I was not expecting it to be good but I like Rourke so I gave it a chance. Absolutely nothing original about it. It's not Harold and Maude, but I enjoyed it. All 4 of the main actors were good as were their characters. 8 might be a little high but I'm going with it"
" dont understand of some things....
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,7,Is the police gonna ask or detains Ed for being driver to ashby after the first kill scene?
" A Tale Of Two Movies
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,7,"Surprising & entertaining, there's a weird time displacement in the movie as the scenery & the feel suggests the early 80's but then you see a laptop and a tablet. There's a point in the movie where the story/plot switches gears somewhat abruptly and it becomes a different movie than what you started out with. Emma Roberts is cute & adorable in her role. Mickey Rourke has seen better days. Sarah Silverman's looks are never her problem & she has some cringe worthy lines that are outstanding (not in a good way) & her actions as a mother are embarrassing to watch but you do get some empathy for her son. Enjoyable movie, I wasn't disappointed."
" Good Movie, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly
",2020-02-06 00:00:00,7,"This movie has the crotchety old man who sort of mentors the young boy...unfortunately, he kills a lot of people along the way. As weird as the story is, somehow it made for a good movie. Parts of it were laugh out loud funny - even through it's not a comedy. There were a lot of things that were just too far fetched ...like a high school kid running a CT scan machine! But I guess we all know it's fiction!"
" Ashby
",2020-01-07 00:00:00,4,Ashby is an unoriginal coming of age dramedy. Misfit Ed Wallis (Nat Wolff) has moved into a new town after his parents have split up.Ed is a smart alec who wants to try out with the high school football despite not having the build and is a bit of a nerd. He fancies classmate Eloise (Emma Roberts.) Ed also has to put up with his mother (Sarah Silverman) who likes casual sex.Ed gets friendly with his crusty neighbour Ashby (Mickey Rourke) who he initially approached to find out more about old people.Ashby gets Ed to drive him around to places and they find out more about each other. Ashby is not a former napkin salesman as he claimed but a retired CIA hitman. He is also very ill and has a short period to live.While Ashby makes amends that he might have been used to kill people that were never a risk to national security. He also teaches Ed a little about life and how to defend himself. In short Ashby becomes a father figure to Ed.It is all very hard believe. Ashby and Ed bond very quickly. Ed turns out to be a very good fast receiver on the football field. Ed easily strikes up a relationship with Emma when all through the movie I found Ed to be a mouthy irritant.Ashby is watchable enough but is a half baked hybrid of various high school themes themes with an uneven tone.
" Not terrible, but nothing new
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,3,"Well, I watched it to the end, so it can't have been all that bad.While there's a sort of story here -- boy-striving-to-become-a-man befriends old-man-close-to-death and both learn something from the other -- the characters are largely unbelievable. And while there is a sort of conclusion, the journey felt remarkably aimless.I almost gave up when the smart ass sarcastic teacher was doing what seemed to be an over-written stand-up routine in front of his class. But I'm semi-glad I stuck with this -- though that should be viewed as very faint praise indeed (hence the 3 out of 10)."
" Great indicator of how strange, mixed-up & pointless this is
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,3,"I fell asleep half-way thru watching it. It took me about 48 hours to realize ""Hey. I never finished watching that film. Or, did I finish? I don't 100% remember. What was the point? Did it make it? Where was it going? I don't know."""
" What else?
",2019-12-15 00:00:00,10,"This Movie contents everything you need for entertainment and messages about importance meanings in life.Watch, enjoy, laugh and if needed cry.Emotions and entertainment, what else do you need in life?"
" Pretty average coming of age movie
",2019-11-27 00:00:00,6,"A bit of a lame and over sentimental story with no memorable moments. Definitely for the younger viewer.
Rourke puts in reasonable performance given the poor script and good to see him again."
" What a surprise!! Watch it !!
",2019-11-27 00:00:00,9,"Never heard or expected anything from this film . Within minutes I'm enjoying it .
The back story could be said to be a little silly but it's nothing in the sheer joy and warmth all the characters bring to it .
What it also shows what a brilliant screen filler Mickey Rourke is he oozes personally which we should see a lot more of !!
Funny , witty , charming and warm , not to forget a few murders !! What's not to like"
" What's not to like
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,9,"I found it to be a funny, quirky and very enjoyable movie. I didn't know what to expect and I felt like taking a chance from my usual action thrillers and historical dramas. The writing was very good and the characters lived up to their roles. I might even watch it again!!"
" Great Movie
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,9,You're smoking crack if you can't appreciate this movie.
" Funny but with a good message
",2019-02-26 00:00:00,8,Ashby - a predictable yet nice movie. The Old and young duo looked very nice while watching. Story line was ordinary but perfectly executed by the actors.
" VERY good
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,10,"Mickey Rourke is finally in a good film again! Good acting, Entertaining, touching. This is a great film for teens & parents of divorce. It keeps your attention. Best of all, it's not like the corney or predictable Hollywood films. It will even make you laugh at times. Worth watching for sure!"
" EVIL TRIUMPHS WHEN GOOD MEN DO NOTHING
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,8,"Ed Wallis (Nat Wolff) is the new kid at Varga high school in Virginia. He lives with his over sexed mom (Sarah Silverman) and has a Skype father. He wants to try out for the football team but is shy. He likes the geeky Eloise (Emma Roberts) who shares his crush. A high school assignment to talk to an ""old"" person causes him to form a friendship with Ashby (Mickey Rourke) who has a secret past we soon uncover and a few months to live. Ed becomes Ashby's chauffeur as he tries to make amends and teach Ed to grow a set.The film is a comedy drama and a little dark at times and quirky at other times. It is also a romance and could be used as a date film. Enjoyable performances.Guide: F-bomb. Off screen sex. No nudity. Emma Roberts shows off her ""A"" cup bra."
" Fun
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,6,"Well conceived,well acted,tongue-in-cheek comedy. Mickey Rourke and Nat Wolff deserve credit."
" An MRI machine in the basement? Really?!
",2018-10-03 00:00:00,1,"This might have been a mediocre movie. I knew someone who was a military sniper. His guilt over what he had done overcame him, and he committed suicide. There isis a meaningful story here that could have meant something.But how stupid can a producer, writer, or director be to put an MRI in the basement of a family home? It boggles the mind how stupid that is. A magnetic resonance imaging machine (MRI) will attract any metal to it while it is operating. That includes wrenches, bicycles, zippers on jeans, metal snaps on varsity jackets, etc.I have a friend who has metal fragments in his neck. He can't have an MRI because the machine would literally put the fragments out of his neck and possibly kill him. That's how powerful an MRI is. This whole MRI thing is just stupid, stupid, stupid."
" Wow! Just Wow!
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,10,"Yes, this is a coming of age story, but it deftly avoids all the cliches. It is not Karate Kid or others like it where a skinny nerd becomes an amazing hero when mentored by a wise elder. Instead the skinny nerd is actually a disciplined athlete already, but struggling with how to use his physical gifts but avoid the high school jock culture. As the new kid in school, he wisely avoids the jock posse by hiding himself in a locker. When he emerges, his eventual love interest, noting the unorthodox entrance, asks if he just came from an alternate universe. No, he replies, Oregon. When he does get beaten up, it's not by a bunch of jocks, but he is ambushed with a single hit from a baseball bat out of nowhere, and his antagonist's motivation is not what you'd expect. When his mentor sees his black eye, he starts to help, but when asked by our hero, ""Are you going to teach me how to fight?"" He replies, ""No. I don't have enough time for that. I'm going to teach you how to take a punch. That's probably going to happen a lot to you,"" and begins the lesson. The kid doesn't become the perfect athlete, and his accidental mentor is ridiculously flawed. Nothing in this movie takes the cliche way out, and our protagonist uses his wit and erudition even more than his physical skills to fix his predicaments. Don't miss the scene where he apologizes to his girl-friend and brings the world's strangest make-up gift. Also props to the English teacher for assigning, ""Catcher in the Rye, a story about a whiny narcissist who deserves everything that happens to him."" All that barely scratches the surface. It's not, ""You'll laugh. You'll cry."" Instead you'll go, ""Wow. That was real, and fun too."""
" Sneaky Great
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,7,"I had this movie on my watchlist for months before I finally tried it, worried about the reviews from critics. Rourke is great! Nat Wolff is a rising star. It's a warm feeling drama with some light comedy. Great flick!"
" Assassin-college guy with his ideals u ll cherish watching!
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,8,"Tone, Script & Story: Story is about an assassin (Ashby) who is about to die and just before that he tries to do right one of his assignments which was done wrong as he learns it, for that he now will kill 3 more people.What did I most liked about the movie was character build up of Ed Wallis. He, his ideals, his methods, will make you think. More than that I liked how he influences to pardon Ashby's last assignment. The filming will get you going.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: A Justified and a visual treat. Acting: Better than average.Final Verdict: An assassin who tries to find redemption. In the run befriends a college going person who influences him with his thoughts. A film you will cherish watching."
" Ashby: An Under-appreciated, Endearing Film
",2018-06-06 00:00:00,7,"I consider this film something of a hidden gem; It has an endearing charm, one which i find slightly criminal given its poor reception and box office success. 
The real draw to 'Ashby' for me personally is Mickey Rourke's performance, and its place within his filmography. To me, it proves his ability to act has endured, past 'The Wrestler' - a film in which many naysayers would believe to be his last good role. This in itself gives the film an added value that cannot be tarnished (not even by Rourke's behaviour in his personal life). 
Furthermore, Emma Roberts and Nat Wolff are not without their charm; solidifying the strength of the cast. 
However, the film is not without their flaws. Stylistically, the film is slightly underwhelming - a majority of the shots being bland and straightforward. 
The humour is also somewhat strange and executed in a peculiar manner, but this is perhaps to be expected, given the generally quirky nature of Wolff's characters. 
In the end, these are all flaws to be tolerated, and the value that lies within this film is a greater in comparison. Again, If nothing else it is truly a sight to behold for all devoted fans of Rourke's."
" A heartwarming coming of age story
",2017-11-21 00:00:00,8,"A coming of age story where a high school kid has to talk to an old guy for an assignment and ends up forming a sort of a friendship with his next door neighbor who has been an assassin and is about too die.It is not a very original idea, but it is a very enjoyable movie. Actually it is a bit of a more original young guy being friends with old guy story because of the whole last assassination mission. Besides all the characters are great. I also like the guy's mother played by Sarah Silverman. When she is worried Ashby is touching her son it is a very funny moment.Mickey Rourke is absolutely perfect in his role. It is a great character and he also manages to make us love him all the way. We can also see him being influenced by his younger friend. This makes the story so much sweeter when we see people in all stages of life learning from each other."
" slow moving
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,8,"But definitely worth it. Watched it for Emma Roberts, wished she'd played a bigger role, and Silverman, same wish. But stayed for an interesting story, albeit as implausible as it gets. It ended up just being...sweet. Mickey Rourke, who will never be considered an acting titan, can do regret...like in the Wrestler. I feel he draws from a deeply personal place for that regret, and it translates well on screen. Just my two cents."
