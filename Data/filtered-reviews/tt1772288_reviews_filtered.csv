" Loved it.
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,8,"Loved it. That's it.
A simple film that will leave you a soothing feeling in heart."
" Finally! Pacino takes on a good role! circa 2015
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,10,"I have been so disappointed in too many of Pacino's movies--probably since Scent of a Woman. Those following, seemed to all have the same flavor--him yelling and ranting and just making too much noise! Well hallelujah! Al Pacino is one of my all time FAV actors! I don't get how he took some one these other parts. I'm wondering is he lazy? Does he not read the scripts? Does his agent-who only wants to make $$-do the script ""reading"". IDK! But Tom Hanks and Matt Damon never play mediocre roles. Al Pacino is just too damn good to do some of this cr__! So, thank you, movie Gods, for putting him in this place! And along with Annette Bening--who IS my most FAV female star!! EVER! Like in Scent of a Woman, where we see a tender, thoughtful side of his character, we see this again here. OH! And I did not know of this movie til yesterday! So why did the box office bomb on this!! And one reviewer--who was right on about this being such a great version of Pacino--however, he misstated his age. Five years ago, Pacino was not quite yet in his mid 70's. OOPS! He's a year older than me-born April 1940. Ouch! He is freaking 80 already! Well, he doesn't show it. So keep getting the good -to great roles Mr. Pacino. Cause we want to see so much more of you! This Irishman was great! ""Holloywood"" too small a role. But, ""HUNTERS""!! NOW!! that is one to see at least twice!"
" Fantastic movie!!!
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,10,"I was captivated by this film, and appreciated how the character of Danny Collins evolved throughout his life's stage. It was a beautiful film filled that oozed both positive energy and grief. Everyone did a great job collaborating to put this film together. Kudos!"
" Amazing
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,10,I was shocked at how great this movie was. A roller coaster of emotion.
" Put a smile on my face and filled my eyes with tears
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,7,There is not much to say. I love Pacino and if you also do you will enjoy this little movie. If you dont love him please leave.
" Best Acting and script
",2019-09-06 00:00:00,9,AL pacino look like Mature and very impressed Actor all time. I have seen his acting as like as much Robert Downey Jr.
" Feeling nostalgic
",2019-08-01 00:00:00,10,Went into this movie really not being too sure about it but didn't take me long to totally fall in love completely heartfelt and not overdone
" Good but not deeply memorable
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,6,"DANNY COLLINS (2015)Al Pacino as aging rockstar Danny Collins seemed weirdly miscast to me, but hey, it's Pacino and he pulled it off in movie star style. This story was loosely inspired by an event in folk singer Steve Tilson's life: Tilson recieved an encouraging letter from John Lennon, (with Lennon's phone number on it), decades after it was sent. He wonders how it might have changed his life if he got the letter at the time it was written. In this film, the rocker goes through a Hollywood movie sort of change and goes to New Jersey to make things right with a son he never met. In fact, in real life Tilson has several children that he has solid relationships with. The cast, including Annette Bening, Jennifer Garner, Bobby Cannavale, and Christopher Plummer, all turn out solid performances, (Bening is fantastic, actually), but the enjoyable movie never catches fire with me. I thought it was good, but not great; easy to watch, but it felt contrived and not deeply memorable to me."
" A Movie For Anyone That Loves John Lennon
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,9,"""What do you think about that, Danny Collins""John Lennon's words changed Danny Collins from a selfish, spoiled, cowardly man, to a considerate, wise, determined man. Was it too late?Danny is a substance abusing, alcoholic, aging rockstar with one Rod Stewart-like song titled 'Hey, Baby Doll'. His fans are older woman who can hardly stay awake until the end of the show. He has no children, only a gold digging, unfaithful wife, Sophie, who is young enough to be Danny's granddaughter. Danny has only one friend, his manager Frank, a sarcastic, former alcoholic, now sober thanks to Danny's efforts.At Danny's birthday party, Frank reveals he'd discovered a letter John Lennon had written to Danny at the beginning of Danny's career, which neither Frank nor Danny had known about. John Lennon explains that fame has no impact on who you are as a person. It's all up to the individual to stay strong and stick true to their craft.Danny takes these words to heart, only wishing he'd known about the letter sooner. If so, maybe his life would have turned out differently.Danny decides it's time to finally pay a visit to his son, Tom Donnelly, whose mother only knew Danny from a one time thing at a concert. Danny checks in at a small New Jersey Hilton not far from where his son lives. Danny quickly charms hotel staff, especially the practical-minded, almost age appropriate Mary, the hotel's manager.When Danny arrives on Tom's front porch, Tom's wife Samantha answers, glad to finally meet her husband's father, but knowing Tom will not be so accepting of Danny.Tom is angry with Danny, saying he has no interest in having a relationship with his father.However, Danny doesn't give up. He uses every resource he has to locate a special school for Tom's young daughter Hope, who has severe ADHD and trouble focusing in a regular school system. Danny gains Hope's acceptance at a special school for kids like Hope, winning some respect from Tom. Shortly after, Tom reveals to Danny that he has cancer. Danny remains optimistic throughout Tom's treatments, and sticks by his son's side, for the first time.Danny Collins is one of the rare movies where I wouldn't change a thing. The actors are charming, believable, and seem to genuinely enjoy their experience on the movie. The writing and directing by Dan Fogelman of 'This is Us' is practically flawless. The music, made up of an emotional score, original songs, and the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack of John Lennon's masterpieces, wonderfully complements the movie's feel-good tone.Danny Collins is a rare gem of a movie that needs to be seen."
" What a wonderful performance
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,9,"Whoever made the preview for Danny Collins should go back to Disney where he belongs. This movie is not a comedy! This is not a light romance with plenty of fluff and chuckles! This is a heavy, well-acted drama that hits home, and the so-called romance was probably cooked up so the man in the lab could have something to put in the preview.If you only think of Al Pacino as the gangster who always shouts in his movies, rent this movie and think again. He plays a has-been rock star, and rarely, if ever, have I seen a more realistic portrayal. The general public has a definitive idea of how a ""rock star"" lives and breathes, so most actors pander to their audience's perception. Why risk getting criticized when an obvious performance will guarantee a success? Al Pacino had the guts to take on the tired trope, and to do it correctly. His character, while written well, could have been played in the typical fashion: drug use before a performance, boredom while singing the same old song, entitled charm while flirting with someone new, rehearsed ease with the stand-by pal, and escapism while at the nearest bar. Instead, the audience is treated to a new, accurate performance. We see the desperate need for a mood alter before going onstage, because without it, he's forced to acknowledge his stagnant life. We see shame as he sings the same song he's been singing for decades, and we feel gratitude during his scenes with Christopher Plummer, since his friend has stuck by him in his uncertain environment. The flirtation with Annette Bening is a necessity, because without bravado, he might feel pathetic. His scenes at the bar aren't funny filler, but instead reaching out in a last-ditch effort not to be alone. All this is felt by Al Pacino's performance.In case you need any other reason to see the movie, it's Bobby Cannavale. After decades of abandonment, Al reaches out to his son, Bobby, and tries to bond with his family. There are so many layers to Bobby's performance, you'll only be able to really appreciate it when you watch the movie for the second time. My hat goes off to screenwriter and director Dan Fogelman, because the film doesn't follow the expected path. This is a heavy film, so grab more Kleenexes than you think you'll need."
" WHADYA THINK OF THAT?
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,8,"Danny Collins (Al Pacino) is an aged rock star who lives off his past hits with mediocre concerts to adoring fans. He still loves his drugs, alcohol, and young girls. A newly discovered letter from John Lennon, to him, gives him an epiphany as he reaches out to the only family he has never known, that of his illegitimate son Tom (Bobby Cannavale). While attempting to connect to a family that doesn't want or know him, he meets Hotel manager Mary Sinclair (Annette Bening) who is smart, witty, and charming. She is someone Danny can talk to.Al Pacino, who has done far more movies these last 10 years than his first 10 in films, gives us a good performance in a role that didn't seem right for him. The support cast was good. I liked how the film ended, not too formula, but not too far from it. The film is inspired by the letter that Steve Tilston received, although Danny Collins' song ""Sweet Baby Doll"" was so much like ""Sweet Caroline"" I had to think about James Taylor. The film stayed away from any real original music. Even Danny's new original song started out with riffs from ""Imagine."" It was a let down in the musical department. They might have been better off with an old singer who can also act.Guide: F-bomb. Nudity (Katrina Cas of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"")"
" a bio pick about the rock star lifestyle
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that family is more important than anything including fame. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" A future Al Pacino classic
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,9,"To those of us lucky enough to have witnessed the best part of Al Pacino's movies, the quality of his performance won't surprise us. What will surprise us is that after a couple of minutes we forget that he is Al Pacino and start looking at him as Danny Collins. I think that for an Actor this might be the best compliment of all. He is so truthful in his acting, so natural, that we follow the story alongside him, and start seeing an ageing rock star dealing with reality. Loved the movie, would watch it again any day. Congrats to the team who made this possible!"
" What a great movie
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,10,"Good Jupiter, guys and girls. I am not a particular fan of Pacino, nor any ofe the guys from the eighties,But what a great movie this one was. Besides the script, you get to realize how important the direction is, and the script. Bobby Cannavale, I have followed you since Third Watch.You did a greatjob here this is a drama, ¿right?. You made me laugh with those subtle looks, to your asshole dad, in the movie. Great, great movie. I give it a ten."
" Irresisible
",2018-04-30 00:00:00,8,"I really liked this one. It wasn't what I thought it was going to be, well truthfully I didn't know much about it going in but I wasn't expecting a charming family story. Al Pacino is very likable as an aging rock star who discovers a 40 year old undelivered letter written to him by John Lennon. This inspires him to give up his hard living ways and reconnect with his estranged son. Apparently inspired by a real story about a folk singer (they may have taken some liberties here) as Al appears more like a lounge singer, throughout I got a kinda Neil Diamond vibe from him, his one hit song that he's sick of but keeps having to sing sounded a lot like Sweet Caroline... dun dun da. Anyways a very sweet movie, watching 'Danny"" try to change his ways and charm his way into his sons life. Great cast, cute romance with Annette Bening as his hotel concerige /girlfriend, the fabulous Christopher Plummer as his frustrated manger and Bobby Cannavale as the estranged son.The precocious little girl (granddaughter) was a scene stealer."
" Predictably Entertaining
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,5,"This is a very sweet & sappy film; one that kept me kind of entertained. The actors did their jobs effectively. The screenwriting, for me, was the real issue. Cliche bingo kept me alert as I watched the particularly snooze worthy scenes. Naming the Grandkid ""Hope"" was an effective, lazy way to have lines write themselves. ""Mr. Collins, say goodbye to Hope"" ... please.I reckon all great actors need an easy film to pay the rent ~ and this one was a slam dunk paycheck for skilled veterans like Pacino, Benning, & Cannavale. Nobody broke a sweat except Pacino ... but he does sweat easily. Plus, Danny Collins looks like he's a loving, loyal & colorful person in real life. He probably would have been fun to sit next to at a bar and chatting; something I truly appreciate in a person.If you want a film that isn't dark, won't provoke one deep thought, and that you can watch while doing menial household chores ... this is it. Didn't hate it; didn't love it. It's like oatmeal for breakfast; healthy and bland."
" Not perfect, but not bad either
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,6,"Not a perfect movie by any means, but the kind of film that rarely gets made by studios anymore: an ensemble cast of stars, a simple plot and very few explosions (okay, none). Yes, there were logical leaps and imperfect plot twists. But there were also great performances, which went a long way."
" Excellent Pacino movie! 8 Stars from me!
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,8,"This is a movie for everyone, especially musicians who have problems dealing and coping with all the fame and money. It can wreak havoc upon anyone's mental stability, including the drugs that are available to the wealthy. I really enjoyed this movie. The only thing that I would have done differently was add more closure with the hotel manager, Mary Sinclair and his relationship with his family. Otherwise, a fine masterpiece with just enough to satisfy some kinds of closure."
" Excellent Family Drama
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,10,"Pacino has reached the top of his form. He has matured into the perfect actor. This film is his best work. Ever. The screenplay is good all around but exquisitely beautiful in places. The casting is true art, using some of the best talent in town like Pacino, Christopher Plummer, Annette Bening and especially Jennifer Garner. The acting is top of the line, with the players pulling the story together like a breathtaking Russian ballet. This movie is modern family drama, with a soft touch. It has scenes that will make you cringe a bit, and others that just make you smile inside and out. And add in a few laughs. There is an adorable love story, and there's also a little girl that will steal your heart. Broken family relationships cause pain and heartache. Sometimes they end on a good note, and sometimes not.Have you ever smiled, or even laughed, through tears? This film might do that to you. Highly recommended."
" True Story of an Aging Rocker
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,7,"Based on the life of singer Steve Tilson.Danny Collins (Al Pacino), is an aging rocker who has lived ""the life,"" and left a trail of wreckage in his past. Upon receiving a birthday gift from his manager, Frank (Christopher Plummer), a long lost letter John Lennon and Yoko Ono had written to him over 40 years ago, Danny begins the journey back home. His journey brings him to his son,Tom Donnelly (Bobby Cannavle), wife Samantha (Jennifer Garner), and his seven year old granddaughter.Not an in depth look at Tilson's life, just a glimpse into the last chapter. Good film for a quiet weekend. Lot of F-Bombs."
" ****
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,10,"Another wonderful Al Pacino film where he stars as an aging rock singer who wishes to seek meaning to his life when he discovers an autographed letter from John Lennon.Collins travels to New Jersey to meet his illegitimate son and his family. Kind-hearted, he meets immediate rejection by the son, nicely played by Bobby Carnivale. As the manager of the hotel, Annette Bening is completely unrecognizable and very effective as the straight-laced manager who comes to understand and appreciate Danny.Christopher Plummer, also very good, looks like he came out of a fitting for The Exorcist in a few scenes.This is a story of family, redemption and pulling together in crisis. A true winner all the way."
" The premise of this movie simply doesn't work
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,4,"The character appears to be one with designs on becoming a serious singer/songwriter in the folk realm back in the day, only to have his first album produce horrific sales numbers so the studio has him sing pop songs written by other professional songwriters. In this area he apparently achieves huge fame as a pop singer, yet he spends the movie referring to himself as a ""rock star"". I cannot find any parallel artist in the real world who sings other people's songs, yet is called a rock star. Rock stars front bands and/or write their own material. Pop stars sing melodies that were written to sell music to simple people. I've also heard folks say that Neil Diamond is a potentially similar artist, but as wretched as some of his music is (and some is awesome), he wrote the vast majority of what he performs. I just don't get what reality this character lives in or comes from. 90% of this movie is based on a faulty premise and the other 10% is hokey formula stuff."
" *** 1100th review *** from now, never again BIOPIC of famous (web)
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,7,"In those dark ages of American movies, along the hollow sequels, childish animated movies, a new despicable genre has arisen: the Biopic ! When they are about politicians or artists, you can a sure awful expect a stinky turkey: Along Vatican, Hollywood is in making saints: with those Biopics, they kiss asses so much that it ends up like excruciating hagiographies! Usually they start with the caption - inspired by true facts - so it means that it's not the reality but the reality they want to find: However as PKD said, truth can't allow revisionism and at the end, even small changes means something else... With politicians, you end with propaganda and with artists, you end up with advertising... Focusing about those 2 categories is a slap in your face: you should understand that the more they consider them great, worthy, unique, historic, irreplaceable, talented, the more they tell us, the common, ordinary people that we are valueless, unworthy, all the same, untalented, uneducated and expandable! So it's your choice to accept being ridiculed, but for myself and from now, i won't never watch again those kind of biopics! Actually, this Al movie can't really be considered as a Biopic even if it lies upon a true fact. In a way, it's a sort of companion to his recent Humbling as in the two movies are drama / comedy in which Al plays an artist: it's funny to notice that indeed the 2 movies opens just moments before the show! Here all the stupid sexual content of the other movie has been (almost) cut and it's more a movie about family commitment so a topic Al has already visited but no in such funny way! Al is rather convincing as a singer and the more he gets old, the more he connects with kindness and heart with the other characters! His lost family is well played and it was great to see again Alias now a mature mother! The only big thing that i regret is the way big money and celebrity addiction comes so easily to solve all problems as the audience is ordinary and not ultra wealthy, meaning that our problems just stay! The last scene is really well done but the after credit just kill its emotion!"
