" Keanu as a Lawyer?
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,7,"We've not seen Keanu Reeves as a lawyer since Devils Advocate.It's a good look for him.He's very credible, very sincere and very believable.There are many elements of this movie to like.Renee Zellwinger's first movie in six years.I hardly recognized her appearance.Her expressions and mannerisms are there and that's the clue.It's also nice to see Jim Belushi in a good movie, it's been a while.This is a very engaging movie, right from the beginning.It's a strange twist when the son, Mike refuses to speak to his attorney.He continues that position until he declares that he's going to take the stand.There are no spoilers here but I encourage you to pay attention to Mike.Also the flashbacks to the scene of the incident.I like these types of movies because the truth is all there if you can see it.It's not until the end that the pieces fall into place and the truth is revealed.The cast here is solid.Even the portrayal by Janelle.The conflict between her and Loretta and is tense and telling at the same time.Is it a woman's intuition?This movie will keep you guessing right up until the end."
" Absolutely loved it
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,9,"Took me a little while to get into the syle of the film. Once I got it, I watched it again the day after. It has everything that I love; psychology, a little sense of humor, a good script, good music and a great cast. The story surprised me a few times and I appreciate that. Recommend to everyone if you love something different than a love story."
" This could've been great
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,6,"I'm a Keanu Reeves fan so was quite disappointed with this. Zellweger, Belushi and Reeves all look bored and not fully committed to this.
The plot is cookie cutter right up until that daytime TV drama ending which renders the entire plot unbelievable.Also, the actor playing the accused has such a punchable face and his stubborn silence and grimaces are infuriating."
" Renee's Drastic Plastic Return in The Whole Truth
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,5,"Renee Zellweger clearly looks so different after having had an over five year hiatus since starring in movies. When we last saw Renee Zellweger in some of her films like New in Town or Appaloosa, she was the Renee we all know and love. A bombshell. Now, she appears a former shell of her once bombshell self for whatever reason, but what a shell she still is. And we get a quick, sweet peep of that shell in The Whole Truth as Renee exits the shower with a towel hanging where we nearly see Renee's whole truth. Girl's face looks crazy though. If you're one who desires a more natural look, look no further than Gugu Mbatha-Raw, the most very fair beauty. I love Gugu. Keanu Reeves is looking most handsome. I love Keanu. The Whole Truth has short, short stretches where it's actually pretty good. Pure drama. And I love the twist ending."
" slow but captivating
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,6,"What has happened to Renee Zellweger ? was it really her ? clearly had work done around the eyes - making them wider, from her days in Chicago or Bridget Jones.
Keanu Reeves is rarely in a bad movie. So its watchable."
" The Whole Truth
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,5,"Reeves defends a young man accused of murdering his father (Belushi), but the man refuses to speak, although it becomes increasingly clear that the father was abusing the mother (Zellwegger).Done very much by the numbers and barely leaving the courtroom set, this is actually made more interesting by sticking to simple story telling rules rather than going off on some dramatic courtroom drama tangent. That said, it is clear that the story has to produce something surprising to fulfil its story telling requirements and when that comes there is both a feeling of ok, I can buy that as well as ok, so what. A perfectly serviceable thriller but that seems ultimately to be just an episode of Colombo etc with big stars in it."
" The Whole Truth is a judicial drama, but only on a general plot
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,4,"The Whole Truth is a judicial drama, but only on a general plot. The film itself is a typical B-movie in which there is 1 top actor. The plot here is linear and predictable. The denouement is served as if the viewer is watching a film with his eyes closed. It's so banal here. And even Keanu Reeves can not paint all this gray and secondary narrative in any way."
" very good idea -- needed better script
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,6,"I watched this as I do like courtroom dramas and it had a shorter run time the most movies -- but there were so many holes left in the script, and there was certainly enough time in the film left over, to fill in, to bring more satisfaction, closure.It did keep me interested, but I felt kind of used, manipulated by the end of the movie. There was a lot of trickery in Keanu's VO narratives, clearly needed to pull it off, but it bothered me... it just wasn't smart enough. But perhaps feeling manipulated was part of the idea because everybody was manipulated in the movie.I think this movie wanted to have a big wow of a twist, like Sixth Sense... ""I see dead people"" but they didn't totally pull it off. I knew way too early in the film something was up, Keanu was the surprise factor.Keanu felt very bland and boring. Gugu is always worth the watch, and wish there had been more of her arc in the movie. Renee was unlikable, which I think was the point, but still... she does look painfully strange. It just made it hard to watch her.I thought there were too many flashbacks especially the one at the end with Boone, too many seeds are planted that do not get reaped at all.. and that bothered me, and it's where I felt the script fell short in the telling of the story. The wicked witch of the west, in the movie, is the only one who's life is not ruined..."
" Twisty-turny fun
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,7,"It's nice to see Keanu Reeves in a mature role. He's capable of great subtlety in his acting, and he does a great turn in this movie. Renee Zellweger, likewise. Gugu Mbatha-Raw was terrific, doing a lot with a not very sympathetic character. Actually, everybody did a good job, including Gabriel Basso. It's really Keanu Reeves' movie, though.
It was kind of low-key, which I appreciated.
I don't like court-room drama novels or movies, and was pleasantly surprised."
" ok courtroom , drama , mystery , but too slow
",2020-07-16 00:00:00,5,"Its too slow too simple, got bored until it reaches post-mid ,
nothing special , i would only recommend it to Law students...."
" An unbelievable story
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,2,"Okay I made a list of all the things I found wrong with this movie.1. What was up with the narration? Was he lying to himself or what? Who was he narrating for? It's supposed to be his thoughts spoken out loud, but that makes no sense if he was lying?2. Why did Ramsey want the kid to speak so badly? Surely this was the best possible outcome for him? What did he want the kid to say? Confess that it wasn't him and pin it on the mum instead? How would that help anyone?3. How on earth did no one question why there was blood on the handle of the knife? That just seems so unlikely from one stab and made it so clear it was staged.4. How on earth was he found not guilty? They based that off of one single testimony which happened to be from the guy on trial. Even when he was asked ""were you in danger at that moment"" he couldn't give a straight answer at first. Makes no sense.5. Why didn't the kid change lawyer? Was he really so confident that he could outsmart a lawyer who clearly wanted him to get convicted?6. Why did Ramsey kill the dad??? The dad didn't even know he was one who had an affair with his wife. Like what kind of psychopath kills his friend just like that. And how convenient that his watch fell without anyone noticing. I thought they were caught in the act by the husband and that his clothes were on the floor and he then forgot his watch or something. THAT would've made much more sense if Ramsey then killed him in self defence in the heat of an argument. Instead of planning a murder in like five minutes for no reason.7. And what kind of cold hearted sociopath of a mum decides to pin the crime on her innocent son? Especially when she was happy to take the hit when Ramsey asked her to, why not do the same for her son? She could've admitted that the son was lying and said that she killed him in self defence like she had already planned. She showed so little emotions during the whole film too. I guess that made her and Ramsey the perfect psychopath couple, but still wth. It suddenly at least makes sense why her husband called her stupid all the time.All in all, it was watchable because it was just simply too unbelievable of a plot. That does not mean I recommend this movie to anyone though."
" It is ok
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,6,It is an ok film. It is not a film I would strongly recommend though.
" The movie does not make any sense
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,1,"The people who made this movie.. No logic. A smart lawyer plans a murder like this, NO.. this is so bad. Dont see it."
" Good plot
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,6,"I liked this movie. I have seen only once a few years ago. Surprisingly, I remember Very well the plot and how it ends. Worth to watch it"
" Well scripted
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,7,"Intriguing story, well dramatized and well acted with Keanu Reeves doing Ann excellent job."
" The worst script of Nicholas Kazan.
",2020-03-10 00:00:00,4,"The good ole final-act plot twist and the reliable OMG-shock-value of someone's depraved morality! These are truly very special and worthwhile things in storytelling narratives.However, when an audience is invested in an entire story arc, shock-value nuggets merely serve as punches of flavor during the runtime. THE WHOLE TRUTH certainly benefits from this gimmicky storytelling, but it is otherwise a mostly bland dish-despite the reliable Grishamy recipe.Without doing much, Keanu shows off a decent range. He is not a swoony romantic, sullen action hero, fish-out-of-water noob in peril, or a slacker-god. For a guy with the diverse resume that he has, he doesn't get enough credit for the spectrum of characters that he has and can play. He fits in totally fine as a moody, but professional defense attorney on the wrong side of an seemingly simple murder case.Honestly, without actually stinking, THE WHOLE TRUTH doesn't have a whole lot going for it. It is a courtroom drama with simple characters, easy-to-follow legal tricks, and cliched trainee whom Reeves hires for his defense team (Neo finally gets to play Morpheus) and courtroom. So the greatest issue lies in that THE WHOLE TRUTH differentiates itself from other legal dramas exclusively through its shocking punchline. And even then, is it really that shocking?THE WHOLE TRUTH is OK, and it's well paced. Belushi is a terrific victim whom we see in full a-hole mode in a variety of strategic flashbacks. But the film never fleshes out the main characters meaningfully. In fact, in lieu of the twists and turns that the script takes, I wonder if the filmmakers lose their narrative focus a bit following the main character around only when they need to. THE WHOLE TRUTH's narrative ends up playing loose with the audience a bit rather than giving them actual heroes or ideas to follow. Instead, the story intentionally leaves stuff out in favor of manipulative reveals."
" It is what it is.
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,6,"Despite what other reviewers think, if you're an attorney do NOT watch this movie. The courtroom inaccuracies are at best laughable at worse annoying to the core. That said, enjoy it for what it is, Hollywood's version of courtroom drama. The ""twist"" is obvious and expected no less than half way through. The acting was top notch and worth every minute of the movie, especially Jim Belushi. Renee should never had the plastic surgery but that aside, she is still a wonderful actress."
" I began to sympathise , then i was outsmarted... Nice movie!
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,6,"Didn't see that coming but this movie starts and lays down many paths... One path that you can sympathise due to personal experience , another one of ha-tress and vengeance and another one of deception that will outsmart you... Nice narration and acting in a simple movie like this from Keanu Reeves... Its not something unique but a good short movie to watch !"
" Pretty good movie
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,7,"I dont care what anyone says, I like Keanu Reeves as an actor, and also Renee Zellweger as an actress. Both seem like pretty regular people away from the screen. The twist at the end was not terribly surprising if you pay attention, especially during one particular scene. Good courtroom drama and solid acting., and Jim Belushi plays a fairly convincing jerk. Give it a watch."
" I like it
",2019-09-21 00:00:00,7,An interesting turn of events. The movie maintains interest all the time. The story itself is like a jigsaw puzzle that progresses gradually and creates a sense of tension in the viewer.
" Love Courtroom Dramas
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,9,Good to see Keanu Reeves now that he's matured and his acting has improved. I loved the twist at the end.
" You Did but You Didn't
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,8,"Good. Damn. Movie. At first I thought it was going to be a cheap copy of Devil's Advocate. But oh how I was wrong! This movie was a cornucopia of possible ""who done its""! It wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I had fixed my mind on the notion that it was going to be this scene that played out, but it wasn't. It had to be one of the two people who was in the room who killed him. But, did it have to be? This is a classic story of everything is not what it seems. On the other hand, it is a classic story of it is exactly what it looks like! The one thing that caught my eye was Renée Zellweger! Periodically throughout the movie I found myself wondering what the hell she did to her face! She does not look like the lovable woman from Me, Myself, and Irene! Had it not been for her voice, I might not have been able to tell who she was. There was a brief moment where she was crying and her cheeks puffed out and you could see the old her. But that was it. Keanu Reeves has an amazing poker face! He did very well. And Gugu is always good. Rarely have I not liked a character she's played. The question this movie leaves you with is... In the end, how far are you willing to go?"
" I know less about the truth now
",2019-02-13 00:00:00,6,"Good news:
the truth is revealed.Bad news:
you don't know if anything is actually true because you are reassured that ""everybody lies."""
" A Solid Mystery with Unexplained Twists
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,9,"Wow! The movie was a well-written screenplay and superb acting. In the movie, the accused son proved himself to be a legal prodigy. The accused son's mother proved herself to be a very suspicious wife of the deceased. The defense attorney proved himself to be a deviant lawyer. It appears the assistant defense attorney was also a legal prodigy herself; later proved herself to be a brilliant attorney. It is a slow movie that required your attention to the details. The surprised ending left a definitive court outcome with several questions unanswered. There were unexplained twists or set of circumstances. Popcorn and water movie recommended."
" Late night viewing, pleasantly surprised.
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,7,"After the shock of seeing Ms. Zellweger's new face I enjoyed the flash back filled drama.
I applaud Keanu Reeves for hanging in there in the entertainment industry,
He's not a 30 year old heart throb anymore but he chooses roles that fit his age and he adds that unmistakable Keanu touch to everything he's in.
Whether he audibly says 'Whoa' or not, there is definitely a WHOA moment or two in this film."
" A bankrupt man's film noir.
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,3,"A very weak story, dull and ponderous. Renée Zellweger chews up the scenery, as Keanu Reeves goes through his usual one dimensional range of emotions, while delivering a terrible 'Philip Marlowe' style narration that would have Bogart turning in his grave. Disappointing."
" An even paced show
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,1,The week ending is matched by a weak beginning and weak middle bit. Keanu Reeves and Renee (you know who) displayed the emotional range of a cadaver. Forgettable characters and slow paced script made this viewing a waste of time. Don't watch this unless you are tired and want a good sleep.
" Keanu showing acting potential.
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,6,"After producing a convincing performance in Devil's Advocate, Keanu Reeves proves that he is in fact a multi facetal actor who can convey various emotions. The Whole Truth is not
an exception but a solid film with considerate effort put into it's storytelling. Keanu is exceptional and the film is wortwhile. Enjoy!"
" Terrible all round
",2018-10-26 00:00:00,1,"I love courtroom dramas and am a big Keanu Reaves fan so this film sounded promising. Unfortunately the writing is really bad, as is the acting from some of the principals. One of the big problems is nobody is likeable at all. Especially the young man accused of murder, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw who has only one expression: permanently angry, aggrieved and hostile, regardless of what the script calls for. Hers is by far the least tolerable character. She doesn't seem to have to act to put on this demeanour, I remember her from a Cloverfield film where she was exactly the same. Producers, if you want your films to bomb, this is the person to cast. Good job. Anyway, very little in this film makes sense, or is remotely plausible. Even Keanu seems bored and going through the motions, probably realising what a turkey it is. Sad."
" doesn't really pull you in
",2018-10-06 00:00:00,6,"An attorney, Ramsey (Keanu Reeves) takes on the case of a young man (Gabriel Basso) accused of killing his father in ""The Whole Truth,"" a 2016 movie.Ramsey has big problems in the case because the defendant, Mike, will not discuss the murder with him, so Ramsey doesn't have much of a defense for him. He attempts to show the abusiveness of the father (Jim Belushi) toward both his son and his wife, hoping to sway the jury. His second chair is Janelle (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), and Renee Zwelleger plays Mike's mother.This film is okay but for some reason, not very involving. The plot is good -- it doesn't go where you think it will -- as is the acting. Zwelleger is particularly effective (though I admit I didn't recognize her at first)."
" It's fine but we've all seen better similar films
",2018-10-01 00:00:00,8,"Trial flicks and movie on courts are an over-explored topic that, at least for me, they don't have anything more to add unless if dealing with unheard 
real life stories or a good writer behind it covering unseen or barely presented judicial matters. Well, that doesn't mean I turn my back to similar themed 
films even though the best of them were already made (""12 Angry Men"", ""The Verdict"" or ""Compulsion"" just to name a few). But I had to 
give it a shot to this one ""The Whole Truth"" just to see what's new that I could get besides the good cast and an impressive trailer. Initial argument: fine 
movie, enjoyable, lacking of wit and thrills but sustainable due to a curious case presented in the story of a teenager (Gabriel Basso) accused of killing 
his own father (James Belushi, stealing the show for a bit). The boy's defendant is Ramsey (Keanu Reeves) the family lawyer, of whom he can barely mantain 
contact because the kid preferes to not say a word about why he committed the crime. 
 As film buffs know those films must have gripping and exciting plot twists, a collage of surprises in knowing the truth behind the crime, the truth 
behind the characters and their motivations as witnesses lie, events unfold, evidences are collected and the list goes on. What almost killed the case (or the 
movie as well) was that the script could and should go deeper with more circumstancial evidences that simply were overlooked (one e.g. the flight thing in defining how much time 
did the flight attentand stood in the cockpit. A checking on the flight's recorder would determine that but...the script prefers to rush the judgement just the judge 
says he prefers to deal with in those cases) or evidences not explored with interest. And 
we can't blame the characters, the district attorney or Ramsey but the fault lies with the writer, who happened to be the great Nicholas Kazan, best known for 
his excellent writing in ""The Reversal of Fortune"", a brilliant for future law students to know how to build a case in order to prove your client's innocent (and 
that was a real life story that wasn't all concluded, at least in my view). But Kazan, however, is credited with other name in ""The Whole Truth"", probably 
embarassment or disowned the final material. Truth is: the film staggers with twists that are quite obvious from the get-go, which also includes the mother role played 
by an unrecognizable Renée Zellweger. Not to mention, the lack of characters to give us a better look at possible suspects for the crime, so when you surround 
your story with few characters it's hard not to see who's the one who did it and the only good thing for it is about why the man was killed - which is obvious as well.
  What attracted me to it was the fact of having the main suspect stay silent for almost the whole film, not even speaking to his lawyer, his best company out there. 
That mystery kid, his silence, only comunicating with drawings and a slightly menacing look kept me going. Won't say that Gabriel Basso was much of a good choice for the 
role, I'd like to see with a more prominent actor challenging himself in being subtle than his usual - but the kid was reliable and interesting; just as much as the 
assistant played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw. In fact, I think she should be the one in the main role instead of Reeves. She's the one who can spot a lie from miles away, even 
dealing with personal problems of her own, and she knows that there's something fishy about this case or about Ramsey's conduct. Reeves come as off-mark, stiff and the 
voice-overs given to him as a form of echoing the feels of ""Presumed Innocent"" are quite pointless. They don't add to anything and they don't make his character become 
beyond one-dimensional. With Mbatha-Raw's character, of whom we had some sort of background the story could become far more interesting than what we get which was a nice 
film that failed to be great because it skips many good stuff and plays it safe by being your usual plot twist trial flick.  
Closing argument: Courtney Hunt's second feature film, right after the outstanding ""Frozen River"" is good, she extracts relatively good performances from her cast. 
But she doesn't make us feel deeply connected with the characters or the environment therefore the slow pace and the suspense she got us immersed in her previous 
effort are all lost in here, transformed into an ordinary film that is easy to please those who haven't walked enough in the long hall of movie trials out there. 
It's not all wrong, it fulfills its purpose: to entertain. Don't go expecting a brainy and complex case, just enjoy a simple ride. As I did. 8/10"
" Good movie
",2018-09-22 00:00:00,7,"Good movie, seems to be very predictable, but surprising at the end"
" Thought Provoking Thriller (of sorts)
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,8,"Here's my take on the subtext of the film. The whole premise is based around the fact that someone plunged a 6 inch hunting knife into a 250 lb man, thereby killing him. It clearly wasn't his petite blonde wife, who weighs maybe 120 lbs. So ostensibly, the only other option is that her muscular son did it. She knows it's their lawyer, who she's having an affair with; because she's his accomplice; her son figures it out. He voluntarily takes the rap for it, knowing that the finger of suspicion will obviously point to him, because there's no way his mother could have perpetrated it. So, she knows who did it, but she doesn't know that her son also knows. The lawyer isn't sure of anything, only that he isn't going to admit to it. It was pointless the mother admitting to it, because she wouldn't be believed. It would be physically impossible. The lawyer can't go down, he's their defence. They can't risk bringing in an external lawyer, because Ramsey is the logical choice, and it would raise more questions as to why Ramsey isn't defending them. The son is a legal prodigy, so he weighs up the evidence and all the implications, and decides on the only course of action that might provide an acquittal for him. So against unbelievable odds, he proceeds and achieves the extremely unlikely. There is a third element to this as well though, and it's the fact that despite the son not really liking his father, he himself is still incapable of killing him outright personally in the manner in which Ramsey does it. But I think, all the same, he's glad he's gone when he's dead, and will do everything to protect Ramsey, because although in a way he resents him for what he's done, he doesn't hate him the same way as he hates his father, because his father is a womaniser and a wifebeater, and Ramsey is neither of those things. It's a good film, because it's a very complicated situation as to how the crime happened and what the ramifications are for all the parties involved. I think also, it's implied that the stewardess was also having an affair with Mike's father, and that because she is either married to the pilot or someone external, she doesn't want to jeopardise her own marriage by confessing to an affair with Mike's father, which is why she opens up enough doubt and ambiguity of the situation in the jury's minds, that it facilitates Mike's paternal abuse narrative as being plausible, and for there to be sufficient opportunity for it to happen in the timeframes mentioned. Oh, and the reason that the lawyer is so cagey when Mike is put on the stand, is that at that point, he's fearful that Mike may just out and say, 'You killed my father, you were having an affair with my mother'. So he keeps the lawyer uneasy by not speaking, which is also part of the legal mastermind narrative. So there are so many threads and elements to the entire plot, that it makes for a well thought out and gripping whodunnit and legal thriller."
" Um ok what just happened?!
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,3,"So I'm totally confused. I get that Keanu's character was the killer BUT other than that I'm like John Snow...I KNOW NOTHING!So when the movie ends it kind of makes it seem like Renée Zellweger's character tricked Keanu's character into killing Jim Belushi's character. Otherwise why would it show those two flashbacks and end with Keanu sitting in the courtroom pondering where his life went wrong? I mean we saw she was getting abused from the neighbor kid's testimony. So we know she was physically abused. That would be reason enough for the son or Keanu to kill the dad (out of a need to protect her) - no other ulterior motive on her part needed. So why throw that in. It's just misleading and confusing BUT it does make a difference as to motive because if Keanu killed the dad out of a desire to not see Renee's character abused anymore then you kind of feel like he was justified and you feel sorry for Renee's character. BUT if Renée's character was deceiving Keanu's character then it changes things to where you DON'T feel bad for her anymore and you have sympathy for Keanu's character instead of leaving the movie thinking Keanu was just a piece of crap. Also why did the son not ever see the physical abuse? You're telling me that the dad was abusive the whole marriage and the kid never saw anything physical. That's just hard to believe. BUT let's say he didn't - are we supposed to believe the dad had principles in a way that he would be abusive but not in front of the son? Like it's not real if no one sees him do it? It was clear the dad was verbally and physically abusive yet it throws you off when they show her abusing herself. The whole thing is so convoluted. Also it seems they threw the black assistant in just so the movie studio could say ""Oh see we did have minorities in this movie."" She was wasted in that role. They made her out to be nuts before she came to work with Keanu which didn't square up with her role and you think she's gonna stand up for something at the end but in the end she just falls in line for the sake of the movie tying up neatly. She just falls off and we never see her again or see any resolution to the relationship between her and Keanu. Is she just gonna show up at his office the next day like business as usual or is she gonna go back to the psych ward or is she gonna go home and sit and stare at a wall for a week pondering her life course?And what is going on with the kid and his mom at the end? Does he think the dad should be dead or not?! He saw what a jerk he was and yet in the end he's acting like the dad was some type of saint and he's acting angry towards his mom. I mean honestly who cares if the dad was physically abusive or not - he was clearly verbally abusive and it really bothered the son so you'd think in the end (no matter who killed him or why they killed him) that the son would just be glad the dad was out of the picture and that he and his mom could have a normal peaceful life. I would understand if the mom wanted the dad dead just for the money (greed) or to run off and be with the neighbor kid (slimy and sleezy) but they never presented any of those as possible reasons - so it's a mystery. Who is ""good"" in this movie and who is ""bad""?I hate it when movies try to be so clever that no one even knows WTH is going on in the end and you're left completely confused and unsatisfied. Lastly Keanu looks a little pulled in this film. I hate to see men get plastic surgery. They lose a little cred when they do that. I didn't think he was vain at all but you can't be a lifelong smoker like he appears to be from all the paps photos IRL and be his age and have skin that smooth. He also looked really pale and waxy. His hair was too dark-if you didn't know this was taking place in the present day you'd have thought he was going to work on a Mad Men era type movie. He had a 1950's look to him that was out of place. It was distracting. Also I hate to keep picking on looks but Renée come on! If you did get work done you should sue the surgeon. And if you didn't get work done well then damn! Getting old has got to suck for actresses. She looking all kinds of rough. She's unrecognizable. Her face is straight busted. She was never a great actress (most of her roles consisted of her pursing her big lips and squinting her eyes a lot) but I didn't realize how much good looks can cover up for some of that. With her looks gone she's just not interesting at all to watch onscreen. So sad. Don't watch this movie. It's just not good."
" If you like these kind of movies, you can guess the ending
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,5,"A slow movie lacking the element of suspense. The script is not smartly written. As a person who loves these kind of movies, and watches them all the time, the ending was not a surprise for me. It was 'meh'PS. I couldn't recognize Renee Zellweger for the first 20 mins of the movie. She looks different!"
" Old hat
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,2,The story is completely idiotic and absurd. It is a film made only to keep you attention. No intelligence.
" one big twist
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,6,"Defense attorney Richard Ramsay (Keanu Reeves) has known his new client Mike all his life. The teenager is accused of killing his dominating father Boone Lassiter (Jim Belushi). It doesn't help that Mike won't speak to Richard whose only strategy seems to be rope a dope. Mike's mother Loretta (Renée Zellweger) is concerned. Janelle (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) joins the defense team.There is a reveal at the end of the movie. I swear that one minute before the reveal, I thought that Ramsay needed more connections to the Lassiters. The plot needs more twists and turns before the reveal. Instead, it seems to concentrate all the twists into one big twist. There is obviously something hidden but it needs a better setup. While the courtroom stays just compelling enough, it could have been more and this could have been a great thriller."
" Great story; horrible execution
",2018-06-06 00:00:00,6,"The story of this movie is great. it has great characters, great story line, and an unending you won't see coming.
The execution of this movie was horrendous. It's set out in a courthouse with witness testimony with the occasional flashback. Criminal court is absolutely boring to sit through in real life, the only thing making it better on big screen is that the testimony is significantly condensed. Because the story is told in an such an uninteresting method, you end up feeling bored despite the story being actually interesting.
This would've been better shown with scenes of the trials and in depth flashbacks to the incidents separate from witness testimony.
.
Also, I know the law changes depending on where you go. But, pretty sure you can't leave confidential legal files scattered around a motel room where any maid can walk in and read it. Sounds like reasonable grounds for disbarment to me.

It was also strange to see Jim Belushi in not a comedy."
" Interesting

" Over dramatic and far from intelligent
",2018-05-11 00:00:00,1,"The legal advisor must have been asleep during filming, the keano narrative is idiotic, the film tries to provide ""oooh ahhhh"" moments that a fall flat every single time. Total waste of time making this movie."
" The Whole Dud
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,3,"The Whole Truth: Directed by Courtney Hunt and written by Nicolas Kazan using a pseudonym Rafael Jackson.Keanu Reeves as a defense lawyer defending a teenager who killed his father and confessed to the crime. He also refuses to talk to his attorney. This makes his job almost impossible. This movie is intentionally deceiving in a lot of ways. The mystery of what actually happened is the entire crux of the movie and it was flimsy to say the least. You know right from the very beginning that the boy didn't kill his dad. You get the sense that the kid is clearly protecting his mom. His mom is supposed to have been in this horrific abusive long relationship with Jim Belushi's character. It doesn't feel like it though. Renee Zellweger, an Oscar winner for Cold Mountain is just lifeless in this movie. Keanu Reeves has more personality than she does. We all know how limited he is. He's fine in this movie. He also is holding onto a secret. This movie really hinges on this mystery. It tries to confuse you with different points of view as for how things happened. It doesn't necessarily walk into Rashomon territory but it runs close. It just does not work and the twist comes out of nowhere and doesn't begin to redeem this very lifeless movie. I give this movie a D."
" Better than average courtroom drama
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,7,"Legal cases in court are about winning. But, most films make the mistake of over-hyping the roles of opposing counsel. Usually one lawyer is a scheming wacko who is over the top in his role. Or, if that's not the tack, then the judge is dishonest or wacko. Neither is true here. Both lawyers seem eager to determine the truth, meaning the story is more about the murder than the trial, even though most of the film is spent in the courtroom. I find that refreshing.In this film, Keanu Reeves is clearly no longer young. He's at best middle aged, and creeping up toward late middle age. In other words, he's 53 and he looks it. His acting here was better than usual. I enjoyed his performance, but then again I usually do. Personally, I think he's an underrated actor, though I would not go so far as to say he is a ""great"" actor.And then there's Renée Zellweger. I didn't recognize her. She looks more than her48 years her, and just plain worn out. Although, with this plot, that's appropriate.To be honest, I'm not sure how I feel about her performance here.I used to sorta like James Belushi. Nuff said.Gabriel Basso, who plays the teen up for murder, does nicely here. I imagine we'll be seeing lots more of him.The twist at the end (we all knew there had to be one) did surprise me. Not what I was thinking all along. Enjoy it!Is it a great film? no. But it's quite good, and very serious minded."
" Renée Zellweger's transformation
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,The story of The Whole Truth is filmed almost entirely in the courtroom with a couple flashes of what happened before. It's a courtroom drama with some twists. Twists that I thought I'd see coming but at the end I wasn't completely right. And that's what I like about mystery movies. Keanu Reeves is getting older but he still has that likeability. Renée Zellweger though I've never been a big fan of her. In this movie I didn't even recognize her. She clearly has some work done there and like most of the time it's not been a success. Why people do that to themselves will always remain a mystery to me. If it was not for her voice I would not known it was her. Her acting was just average. All in all The Whole Truth isn't a bad movie.
" Only thing worse than the story line is the acting...
",2017-12-30 00:00:00,3,"I'm not sure what movie everybody else was watching, but this movie was horrible. Reeves was OK and he was the best. The Prosecutor had one facial expression and one emotional state throughout the entire movie. As far as realism? Let's start with the beginning of the movie when a female deputy arrives at the scene of a murder, where she finds the defendant leaning over the victim who is appears to be dead with a large knife in his chest. How does the deputy react, does she pull her gun and order the defendant to put his hand behind his back? Nope, she does nothing at all and looks more afraid than anybody in the room. BTW she later testifies in court wearing civilian clothes which is not the normal procedure for uniformed officers.Yes, there is a twist at the end, but one of the reasons that it comes as a surprise is the narration provided by Reeves. Without trying to give the ending away you'll find that most of the questions he raises he should already know the answer to. You're also understand why a defendant who refused to even speak to his attorney wasn't given a psych evaluation."
" Renee Zelweggers comeback movie...
",2017-12-18 00:00:00,3,"After she said she in a press conference years ago that she was finished at 40 with acting lolMust be skint and needed the money to pay for all that plastic surgery.Seriously though, I didnt know it was Zelwegger until someone told me. Dont get me wrong she looks very good for her age but she looks like someone totally different and her acting was instantly forgettable as was the whole awful funeral dirge of a movie.Sadly for her this wasnt even good enough to be an episode of a lame tv detective series , awful script, Keanu doing his usual wooden performance and stilted voice acting; dont get me wrong I liked him in the much better John Wick movies but he could have been any actor in this.The story was not unusual or remarkeable and that is what is needed these days after landmark movies like ""7"" and Saw - the audience is expecting something that will tweak their brain and not some old formulaeic straight to dvd wet weekday afternoon movie for stay at home mums/or dads to while away the hours. I was half expecting Adrian Paul and Jane Seymour to turn up lolIf this is Renee's comeback movie then I am afraid she should not have come back lolSome people seem to think the ending was unexpected but both of us figured it out within the first 15 mimnutes of the movie - for a movie to be a good one thats a bad start. I just couldnt get over Keanus awful stilted voice droning on and on and on - its as if he was just picking up a cheque and bored with the whole thing!"
" Worth watching
",2017-12-05 00:00:00,7,"As an erstwhile screenwriter and script analyst, I thought I had this plot figured out. Boy, was I wrong. While not particularly well-acted, the story line is brilliant. This film is an insight into the ruthless way criminal defense lawyers think. ""All witnesses lie"" -- and so do their lawyers. This movie will keep you guessing until the end."
" Bad Story Line, Bad sequence of events
",2017-11-23 00:00:00,4,"No one would believe that the rapping will not be tested by a medical examiner. Mike accused his passed-away father that he was rapping him since he was 12 (and now he is almost 18 yrs old), during this period of time he did not even try to tell his mother, the closest person to Mike I suppose. I expected one question from defense to Mike ""Did you ever tell your mother about your father's abuse""? The story line is empty, so the question was missing. Since the first pleading, I felt something was going very wrong. Questions are very few, answers were not clear. The closing pleadings were too funny to believe (couple of minutes for a murder case!!). The husband told the lawyer than some one close to me has a relation with my wife, but no one knows how he figured out this fact. The funniest thing is that, after killing the husband, the lawyer asked the wife to put her finger prints on the knife- this means the wife is willing to go to jail to cover her relation with the lawyer. Isn't silly enough? How come a first-class lawyer who planned for a complete and clean murder drops his hand watch in the scene. He did not forget to wear gloves, of course, but on the other hand he tried to cover his head in an empty house where Mike should not have been there at all. I can't believe this. a 4-star rating is generous for such movies. My advice for all not to lose their valuable time to watch this!"
" Poorly written, poorly acted, unnecessarily drawn out, BORING
",2017-11-08 00:00:00,2,"I figured this one out within the first 30 minutes, and got confirmation a little later in the film. The twists were fully expected. Characterization was sorely lacking, as was the rest of the script.One day, I'm hoping Keano takes some acting lessons. This was a good movie for him, though, because the rest of the cast acted so poorly, that he was slightly better than they were. The judge was particularly stiff and unbelievable.In all, this was an hour and a half of my life which is gone forever."
" Solid drama
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,8,"This is the sort of film that you figure out about five to ten minutes in but you keep watching because of all the pains its writer(s) and director have taken to convince you otherwise. There were many hidden treats, like seeing Renee Zellwegger acting again after all these years, Keanu Reeves not only deliver a top notch brilliantly well-acted courtroom drama but also showcase rare and unexpected sizzling chemistry with Gugu Mbatha-Raw. Hollywood, please cast them in something else after this."
" Worst courtroom drama like ever!
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,1,"This has to be the worst ever courtroom drama ever i have ever seen in my whole life. There no plot and the twist at the end is really laughable. Take my words, avoid this turkey with a 10 meter pole you will thank me for it. Any the practice episode is better than this turkey of a movie.1/10 , if there's a minus 10 points i would give it -10."
" I did it

Ramsey (Keanu Reeves) is a close friend of the family and his attorney who is trying to get Mike off, Mike who is not speaking. Mike's abusive father (Jim Belushi) was the victim. The only other person in the house was Mike's abused mother Loretta (Renee Zelleger) who was in the shower and Ramsey shows up rather quickly.The film is a courtroom drama with flashbacks. It isn't hard to figure out all the twists. With Mike being much for mute of the film, there was a real lack of drama or urgency as Mike was content to go down with the crime.Early in the film a woman enters a limo who looks like Britney while a Britney Spears riff is being played. BTW it does take place in Louisiana.Guide: F-word. Abuse. Wife rape"
" Unrealistic crap
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,1,"Extremely tedious, with poorly written dialogues and crappy acting. Renee Zellweger,usually a fine actress, seems bored and annoyed playing this nonsense. Reeves is at his usual blankness. The actor who plays the defendant is just awful, a lizard has more facial expression than him. He's probably related to the producers. To be short, the plot twist in the end is ridiculous: if they already had the whole story made up (Renee killed his openly abusive husband in self-defense, after years of beating), why the hell did she let his son take the blame, even knowing that he would probably go to jail for life? What a nice mom! BTW, it seems really easy to get away with murder: he abused me, that's it, not guilty! Just terrible, don't waste an hour and a half of you life watching this. You have been warned"
" Maybe 7/10 courtroom movie
",2017-07-21 00:00:00,7,"SPOILER!The movie delivers good performance from Reeves and Zellweger. Fans of a courtroom movies will like it. I was surprised that Reeves was holding the whole movie on his arms in the most of scenes. It is a challenge after movies like The Devil's Advocate. He is in shape and it's a nice change from sci-fi or action movies (Matrix, John Wick). Back to the 90's I would say. I would love to see him in more movies like that or like The Gift (2001).Contrary to other reviews, I believe that the ending was very predictable or not strong enough to make the movie good enough. The problem is that the movie is not as good as A Few Good Men or or A Time to kill. However, it was enjoyable. And I recommend it."
" What an ending!

He may or may not have abused his wife and son, so they have motive. The son stands accused on trial but refuses to talk to his lawyer. Eventually the son drops a bombshell about his father. But is he telling the truth? Did the son really do it or was it someone else? Fantastic - worth the rental!"
" Highly implausible contrived plot
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,5,The plot is highly implausible. The lead characters in the movie are lawyers or aspiring to be a lawyer. There is clearly a legal way out of the predicament that the unhappy and abused wife finds herself in and therefore there is no need for a murder to take place. The mystery and its denouement are highly artificial and therefore disappointing.
" Barely a decent movie
",2017-06-21 00:00:00,6,"Many of the relevant details in this story come from flashback sequences out of the courtroom. As a result, the memories are assembled into a clear hierarchy that's less about how these memories work and more about giving a clear plot framework. The cast of ""The Whole Truth"" is convincing on the whole, the best being probably Belushi but R. Zellweger very good as well. Maybe the final twist leaves a little to be desired but the story holds water on the whole. Not an extremely original court movie but well acted and directed."
" Interesting courtroom drama, a bit too talkative
",2017-06-21 00:00:00,6,"The Whole Truth: courtroom drama with Keanu Reeves starring as a lawyer trying to defend a young man who allegedly killed his father but refuses to speak.It has a pretty interesting script. The plot twist, somewhat predictable near the end, is just almost good enough to offset the monotonous first half of the movie. Keanu's wooden expression actually worked. Rene Zellweger looks so sullen... but then we get a reminder of why she won an Oscar many years ago. All-in-all the premise of the movie is interesting and the tidbits of facts thrown in between the court scenes reveals just enough at the right time.It's a passable lawyer movie, if you can get past the talking-heads first half of the movie. After three consecutive witnesses were put on stand, I heard some snoring in the theatre 😆"
" Not worth it
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,3,"This is not a movie that is worth seeing in a cinema. At best, this is something to watch on TV at home. It's told like a bad black novel. No surprises here. No good acting. No good script. Skip this and watch something else instead. It's not worth it. I like good lawyer movies and this isn't one."
" The Clues
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,8,"It will be better if the story line left some clues and lets us be a detective. It feels weird when the main character suddenly became the murder without any remind and guide before the ending. Inside movie, there was no any scene told us that they have any special relationships. Whatever just before ending, the scene told us their relationship by a specific hug and conversations. Everything was came too suddenly......"
" Compelling But Low Key Courtroom Drama
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,7,"Why did Mike kill his father? Did Mike actually do it? Who else would have killed Mike's father? And why was Mike's father killed? All questions that permeate this courtroom drama. It's actually a pretty decent little film. It's pretty much all set in the courtroom as evidence is offered (and as flashbacks portraying the evidence being offered.) Mike (Gabriel Basso) is a 17 year old accused of murdering his father. He isn't being very helpful to his defence lawyer (Keanu Reeves) because he refuses to say a word to explain what really happened. As the trial progresses we learn that Mike's father (played in the flashbacks by Jim Belushi) wasn't a very nice man - verbally and possibly physically abusive to his wife and Mike's mother (Renee Zellweger) and possibly abusive toward Mike as well. There are reasons to suspect Mike, and there are reasons to suspect others. There's really no way to know how it's all going to turn out in the end.I wouldn't call this a suspense type movie or a thriller. It was too low key for that. Although it's a fairly short movie (a runtime of a little over an hour and a half) it still has a fairly slow build up to the story - but in this case, ""slow"" does not mean ""uninteresting."" It didn't have me on the edge of my seat, but it did keep me watching. In the end I thought it went a little bit too awkwardly from a low key and slow build up into several twists and turns that suddenly had your head spinning. That change of pace was too abrupt for my liking.Overall, though, that didn't change my appreciation of the movie. It's pretty well done - and a good, well constructed ""whodunit"" is always satisfying. (7/10)"
" Engaging Courtroom drama
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,7,"The Whole Truth starring Keanu Reeves playing a defense attorney to a case of a teen accused of murdering his father. The case here works because Reeves character is portraying a defense attorney to a close friend of the son, and mother. Typically in courtroom dramas, there can be no close friend-type relationship.The acting is very solid, and the film isn't too long which it doesn't drag on or become stale in several parts. It might have a slow build up but within each clue and piece of evidence, it pays off in the end.The ending is offered in a slightly different tone, and may feature a unique twist (and I believe it works here). Looking back, now knowing the ending, there are several little clues along the way. here are some questionable motives of each characters, especially of the son Mike and his behaviour throughout (he is soft spoken and mostly mute throughout), but the answers come out in the end. Otherwise, the Whole Truth is a very solid and entertaining thriller. Worth the watch."
" The Whole Truth Doesn't Come Out in the Courtroom
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,10,"For those who haven't experienced sexual abuse in the home from family members, this subplot may seem sensational. For those who have (and don't yet remember it consciously) it may be disturbing. For those of us who do remember, it is a cathartic story that lets us know we are not alone, and it's a brave subtext for Nicholas Kazan to tackle, Courtney Hunt to direct, and the actors to portray.Jim Belushi's portrayal of Boone Lassiter, the gregarious, happy guy in company but the dominating, abusing husband and father in private, using sex as power, is disgustingly true to life. It's easy to not sympathize with the fact that he was murdered; however, murder is a crime that leaves evidence – the body. Rape within the family leaves no evidence as long as the victims are continually bullied and fearful of getting help.Through flashbacks and narration, the relationships between the Lassiter family as well as defense attorney Richard Ramsay (Keanu Reeves) are revealed. Granted, Ramsay says he knows the family well, that he's an old friend – he used to work with Boone Lassiter. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that he was more than just a friend. Loretta Lassiter (Reneé Zellweger) shows the tension, reserve and hesitation that hallmarks many abused women, however, one scene reveals that her relationship with Ramsay is more than just as a family friend.Mike Lassiter's silence is the problem around which Ramsay has to navigate, and as the story is unraveled it's not until the end it becomes clear why the son refuses to speak to his own lawyer and friend of the family. It's not as simple as teenage brooding. Gabriel Basso gives a nuanced performance – without speaking. The courtroom scenes are well played and riveting, with each redirection of questioning from Ramsay's defense revealing what has actually been happening in this family, through people's lies. This film shows that when it comes to violence within a family, the whole truth often isn't revealed in court. Despite merciful justice in the courtroom, in life, redemption isn't so simple, and people take great risks – and commit crime – in order to protect someone they love. Despite the disturbing subject matter, I highly recommend it – precisely for the subject matter.Isabeau Vollhardt Author, The Casebook of Elisha Grey mystery/detective/SF series"
" Objections overruled
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,7,"This is a pretty good courtroom drama, maybe not right up there with ""Anatomy of a Murder"" or ""Presumed Innocent"", but with enough twists and turns to make it stand out from the crowd.If the film reminds me of any it is ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" with Matthew McConaughey.Without giving too much away, the story involves the murder of Boone Lassiter (John Belushi) a prominent lawyer, and the attempts of another lawyer, Richard Ramsay (Keanu Reeves), to defend the person accused of the murder, Boone's son, Mike Lassiter (Gabriel Basso).The film has an interesting cast including Renée Zellweger as Loretta Lassiter, Boone's wife. Renée Zellweger is an amazing actress who dissolves into her characters, she does it so well here that I didn't recognise her at first.Keanu Reeves is fine as Richard Ramsay. I thought his narration was a little heavy-handed at first, but later we see how it helps set the scene for the revelation at the end.Beautiful Gugu Mbatha-Raw, so memorable in ""Belle"", is a surprise as a young lawyer overcoming past issues.I don't know if anyone else has noticed, but after watching hundreds of crime movies and series on television, I feel that stories with a low murder count often have more weight than serial killer dramas with corpses all over the place. Just look at any of the really good series such as ""Wallander"", ""Jesse Stone"" or ""Vera"" to name three; it's usually only one murder, two at the most, allowing for more complex character and story development. Shows with big murder counts, unless based on real cases, often lead to over-the-top dramas with extreme, unbelievable behaviour.""The Whole Truth"" bears this out. It is tricky with an appealing cast and a classy score by Evgueni and Sacha Galperine, which helps set the mood for this fairly intimate movie, set for the most part in either the courtroom or the bedroom where the murder took place.It may not raise the bar to the heights of the great courtroom dramas, but ""The Whole Truth"" gets you in and keeps you there until it delivers a killer blow at the end."

Rene Z is unrecognizable from the last time I saw her in a film, maybe plastic surgery, but her acting is stellar and she looks damn attractive anyway. This is a classic style court room thriller that offers a surprise at the end, which I thought was pretty good. The film telegraphs the story in a particular direction, but I didn't predict the actual outcome. I look forward to more dramatic films from KR.........."

" Great movie, Keanu returns to being a lawyer!
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,7,"The movie starts out as a mysterious ""who done it,"" and is able to keep this mystery going for most of the movie. More than once I went back and forth in my mind between who I thought was the real culprit, and at the end I can say that I was actually somewhat surprised. Though to be fair I must say that the twist isn't all that huge; it's more of a twist because the writers withheld some key evidence from the viewers until the very end, but they did hint at it once or twice. The Whole Truth is a slow burner. There's never much action taking place, and there's not really a whole lot of depth to any of the characters. The acting is well done however, and I thoroughly enjoyed Keanu Reeves, Renée Zellweger, and Gabriel Basso. While I also enjoyed Gugu Mbatha-Raw's performance as well, I didn't find her character all that necessary to be honest. I'm guessing her character was just meant to be sort of a distraction, and she was. So there you have it. The Whole Truth is by no means a blockbuster. It's not a twisting thriller.... but it is a decent watch. I enjoyed it."

" ""'Tis strange -- but true; for truth is always strange; Stranger than fiction.""– Lord Byron
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,8,"Courtroom dramas remain a favorite with film and stage audiences and THE WHOLE TRUTH shares evidence of that fact. The title is extracted from the oath in court – 'Do you swear to tell the truth, The Whole Truth, and nothing but the truth? So help you God – and therein lies the pinpoint of the story. Written by Nicholas Kazan and Directed by Courtney Hunt the film traverses a tale that faces juries and judges – an apparently open and shut case of murder that plays out until the last few minutes when the surprise is deftly unveiled and the audience is left shocked. Defense attorney Richard Ramsay (Keanu Reeves) takes on a personal case when he swears to his widowed friend, Loretta Lassiter (Renée Zellweger) that he will keep her son Mike (Gabriel Basso) out of prison. Charged with murdering his father Boone Lassiter (Jim Belushi), Mike initially confesses to the brutal stabbing crime. But as the trial proceeds, chilling evidence about the kind of man that Boone Lassiter really was comes to light. While Ramsay uses the evidence to get his client acquitted, his new colleague Janelle (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) tries to dig deeper - and begins to realize that the whole truth is something she alone can uncover.The cast is uniformly solid with Keanu Reeves offering one of his stronger characterizations. There are also fine supporting roles by Ritchie Montgomery as the judge, Jim Klock as the prosecuting attorney, among others. This is a solid film, worth seeing and thinking about."
" Generic Law Something Something or other
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,5,"This is a very generic crime/law deal with a super amount of generic everything. Did I mention this is a very generic film... except for Keanu. Which is why the poster for this film is literally nothing but Keanu's face. The movie is about a kid who killed his father... or did he? Dot, dot, dot.. boring, boring, boring and played out to death. But Keanu does make the film as watchable as he can, but the man can't do everything. So yeah, I'm guessing Keanu Reeves acted in this as a favor for someone. But yeah, it is predicated and forgettable. Also what's his name from a bunch of 80s movies is in this looking bored out of his mind and there to grab a payday. Renee Zellweger was in this? I just learned that from the IMDb page! I guess she was the wife, OMG she looks so different now. I'll have to do a google image search of her later and check before and after pictures of her. I know a girl who was in line behind Renee Zellweger at a coffee shop and Renee Zellweger brought her a 50 dollar coffee card just for the heck of it. Yeah, she is a class act and Keanu has a reputation for being a great guy too. Too bad this film isn't all that."
" You'd think that it's a Grisham story, wouldn't you?
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,5,"While I'll admit that I didn't predict the twist in ""The Whole Truth"", most of the movie is nothing special. Keanu Reeves plays a lawyer defending a teen charged with murdering his - the teen's - father. The father (Jim Belushi) was an overbearing, abusive jerk. Renee Zellweger plays the mother who's been keeping the father's brutality secret.I thought that the most interesting scenes were the exchanges between Reeves's character and the other lawyer (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), and the flashbacks showing what a creep the dad was. Most of the movie seems like other movies that we've seen, especially movies based on John Grisham novels. Zellweger really made a mistake by having her face done. She no longer looks like the same person. Even understanding that ageism is an endemic problem in Hollywood, Zellweger still could've made the choice to keep her natural look. Instead, she opted for a facelift and left herself looking bizarre.It's not a bad movie, just nothing special."
" Disappointing but if you stick it out to the end you won't be sorry. The movie is worth watching for the end alone.
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,6,"""Half my cases had evidence this bad. I just pled them out, got manslaughter and moved on, but this was Mike."" Ramsey (Reeves) is a defense attorney who is defending Mike, his friend Loretta's (Zellweger) son who is charged with murdering his father. Mike isn't talking to him and Ramsey is finding out more and more of the case as it goes along. He is put in a position to defend his friends son without most of the facts, or the truth. This is a movie I was looking forward to. I love court room dramas. I love the tenseness and the mystery you watch unfold. That said I was a little disappointed in this one. Reeves is just not built for a role like this and his acting was distracting. That aside, the movie is almost 100% court scenes. While this may seem like a good thing there is no real character development and you find it hard to really feel any emotion as to what is happening. That fact alone really hurt the movie. The thing that saved it was the ending. The ending took the movie from I'm really disappointed with this whole thing to wow, the ending almost saved the movie. When you watch you will know what I mean. Overall, disappointing but if you stick it out to the end you won't be sorry. The movie is worth watching for the end alone. I give this a disappointing B-."
" Just another ordinary courtroom drama.
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,4,"""They don't teach this in law school. Yes, all witnesses lie.""""The whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God"". How many times have we heard this phrase in some court drama? And that's also the biggest flaw in this film. Haven't we seen it all before somewhere? There was only one thing I was asking myself after a while. Who the hell wasn't lying during this trial? And that's what Richard Ramsay (Keanu Reeves) tells the newly recruited Janelle (Gugu Mbata-Raw) in the beginning. The fact that witnesses always lie. Except Mike Lassiter (Gabriel Basso). He hasn't told a lie yet. He kept his mouth shut since the murder. The fact that his hand-print is found on the bloody knife his father Boone (Jim Belushi) was killed with, is enough to consider him as the prime suspect.The movie isn't really so bad. But it's all so trivial and known that eventually it feels like you're watching an average television drama. It's such a film you subsequently watch again one day and after a while you realize you've seen it already. The well-known cliche's that go with such a crime story, are of course present. You can already assume that the main suspect hasn't done it. Of course you start to focus on another character who could steal the first prize as the prime suspect. And then finally as the plot unfolds, you'll realize you were completely wrong about everything. Although I found the result quite logical.In the past I sometimes secretly enjoyed an episode of ""LA Law"". The way a lawsuit developed, with flamboyant lawyers trying to come up with shreds of evidence in a canny way, so they could obtain the acquittal for their client. Not that it was always so terribly exciting, but the overall atmosphere with the intellectual arguments and lyrical lawyers appealed to me. Again, this intellectual posturing is used by Reeves and his colleagues. And actually Reeves is best suited for this type of role. His reserved and stoic calm attitude makes him an ideal candidate. In addition he has this steely expression where you can't detect any emotion. That comes in handy as a lawyer. I'm sure that if he hadn't tried to find his luck in Hollywood, he could have been a damn good lawyer. At least I thought this was a more successful performance than him playing the detective in ""Exposed"".The only ones who really shined in this movie were Jim Belushi and Gugu Mbatha-Raw. Belushi plays the annoying, arrogant Boone who loves to place himself on a pedestal and as the dominant family head tortures and humiliates his wife Loretta (Renée Zellweger) psychologically. He isn't afraid to use physical violence as well once and a while. He's a despotic person who doesn't tolerate any contradiction. Until a sharp knife is planted in his chest. Mbatha-Raw plays Reeves' hastily recruited sidekick who apparently has a natural lie detector. Although both parts seem fairly limited or void, their influence on the entire history is significant. Unlike Zellweger who really looks old in this movie and also plays a not so impressive role (every other leading actress could have done the job).""The whole truth"" is a trite legal spectacle that results in an ordinary guessing game. That is guessing who's the ultimate culprit. Even the generally marvelous interacting cast can't avoid it to be completely boring with nothing spectacular happening. Most of the time it takes place in a courtroom. That's quite evidently and not surprising. The attempt to contrive a denouement that looks like a huge surprise, so you'll be amazed by the final revelation, wasn't such a success. Are you a big fan of this type of movies? In that case this will be a pleasant treat. However, don't expect too much. ""The whole truth"" certainly won't create a new precedent in the world of court dramas.

" A great ending tops off a solid film
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"There's nothing like a good courtroom thriller. The thing I love about them is that everything can't possible be as it seems, because otherwise there would be no point in making the movie. There's nothing at all interesting about a straightforward court case, however one with a twist is a thing to behold. The only problem with this is that a lot of them end up getting rated purely on the strength of their twist. Everything that has happened up until that point can tend to be forgotten. That's sort of the case again here. A solid, but not stunning movie comes alive with a very strong ending, and it certainly adds some plus points to the final opinion of the film.I tend to really like Keanu Reeves thrillers. A lot of his dramas and sci-fi films are completely forgettable, but when he signs on to a thriller it often seems to turn out very good. Renee Zellweger on the other hand is far from a personal favourite of mine. She has a serious lack of charisma and her appearance change is very distracting in this film. I feel like there are a lot of actresses who could have done a better job in this role.'The Whole Truth' is a film that is entertaining throughout, partly because you are almost certain there is a twist coming, and partly because the story is well written and movies at a good pace. Then at the end it goes Bang! I really enjoyed this film and I think any thriller lovers out there will have a good time with it too."
