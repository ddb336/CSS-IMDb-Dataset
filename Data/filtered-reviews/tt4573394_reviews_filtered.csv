" Great documentary!
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,10,Its a sad story about the cruelty of armenians to civilians living in Khojaly
" Azerbaycan
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,10,"It's all true, this is real genocide. I liked the movie."
" Contains only TRUTH. Highly Recommended
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,10,"This movie based on real historical facts. The world have to see the truth. Sometimes thieves, burglars shout so high that, truth fades away under their tone. But I know that one day the Truth will win. Just watch it and see the realities"
" Unbiased movie based on pure facts
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,10,"Khojaly Genocide is one of the most cruel acts of vandalism of nation against another in the most recent history. In February 1992, Armenian troops took advantage of surrounding an unarmed civil population of Khojaly and committed unseen atrocities. More than 600 civilians were killed, amongst them approximately 100 children.
The movie more or less demonstrates the true story"
" Great film
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,10,A great film that shows those terrible events. It is impossible to look without tears. I definitely advise everyone to watch this movie.
" based on false facts, twisted statements
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,1,"The documentary is based on false facts, which can be easily checked by a simple search.
It is interesting that the journalist, Richard Lapaitis, in an interview given to Azeri tv channel confesses that he is not historian (he is not familiar with he history of the region at all) and yet he confidently takes the right to cover historic events. The result is a documentary with no historic evidence but rather fragments of interviews taken out of context, translated into English and narrated by great actors, to serve as nicely packaged Azeri propaganda.
For example the documentary states that Nagorno Karabakh is a ""unique Azerbaijani cultural island"", whereas there is plethora of literature on indigenous Armenian people living on this land for centuries if not thousands of years. Further it sates that followers of the Albanian church used to peacefully coexist with muslims, which is another well-known and well-organized falsification of history by Azerbaijan which aims at erasing the presence of Armenians by twisted facts and has been criticized by many international scholars.
As for Khojali massacres, these are very tragic events, which unfortunately haven't been investigated. Azerbaijani president Ayaz Mutalibov when interviewed by independent Czech reporter Dana Mazalova, made the following statement: ""What would you say about the Khojaly events, after which you resigned? At the time, corpses of people from Khojaly were discovered not far from Aghdam. Someone had shot them in the legs beforehand to prevent them from running away. Afterwards they were axed. On February 29th my colleagues filmed them. When we next filmed on March 2 these corpses had been scalped. What kind of strange game was that?"". Mr. Lopaitis arrived in Aghdam after the massacre, he was moved by what he saw and heard and 20 years later decided to talk about it. This documentary would be more valuable if he could investigate and dig deeper into what really happened. He obviously couldn't do that and the eyewitnesses couldn't tell him anything that would be against their government. One journalist already tried (Chingiz Fuad-ogly Mustafayev) and was found dead a month later.
To keep this review short I won't cover the rest of the false statements. I would just say that the film may be very highly rated by Azeri population, but shouldn't be taken as serious source by those who want to learn more about the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, one of the most complicated in in the world."
" Perfect film
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,10,A good film showing what Armenians did to Azerbaijanis
" Fact Check. 90% is False
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,1,Seems like this documentary was made by a amateur with no facts! How unprofessional! Over 90% of it has false accusations and no basis. One must look into the nagorno-karabagh war in 92 and 1988 sumgait in Baku against Armenians and 1915 genocide against Armenians to understand this issue.This is an inaccurate documentary! Artsakh has been occupied by Armenians for thousands of years! Azerbaijan didn't even become a Republic until 1920 and only because it was annexed to the Soviet Union. This is simply propaganda by Azerbeijani government to ethnicaly cleansed the area. They have the oil money and weaponry to do so.
" 10/10

" The best film,i have watched this year
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,10,"I advice everyone to watch this film. I can't even imagine that this film is based on reality,but sadly it is"
" The truth about armenian aggression and terrorism is revealed in its beauty
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,10,"Finally, an unbiased documentary based on authentic archives and oral historical sources that are a novelty in recreating true history. The double standards of the global community and dirty political games are exposed as initiators of Armenian terrorism and aggression. It would be really hard to watch this documentary before November 2020 but after those lands were liberated and returned to Azerbaijan - I had a wonderful feeling of prevailed justice."
" Highly qualified for an Oscar!!!
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,10,"Incredible and very truth based movie. It's very important that movie is based on unbiased and very honest presentation about those tragic events-the genocide of 21 century-Xocaly genocide!
Thank you for all involved. Highly recommend to watch and definitely qualified for higher awards, an Oscar included..."
" Historical truth
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,10,This film is based on true story of people who had experienced most horrific tradegy of modern time. Khodjali genocide. Happened at night from 25th to 26th of February 1992.
" Must watch!
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,10,This is an objective cover of the Khojali tragedy by a third party journalist who interviewed all sides. The world should know about this tragedy.

" Great movie of true events
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,10,Very good movie detailing everything that happened to the azeri people
" Best film! True story!
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,10,"This movie made me cry. The world is really blind, armenians should see this. Justice will be served."
" Very impressive movie
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,10,This movie had been taken from the occupation of Azerbaijan territories by Armenian/Russian troops in 1989-1994. Occupation is a simple word but how they did it is just out of humanity. Many of my relatives had witnessed it. I don't wish such horror to happen to anyone in this world even the ones who committed this crime
" Watch and think
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,10,"""Seeing injustice and being silent means participating in it yourself."" Jean-Jacques Rousseau said. All the horrors of the world come from indifference. People, do not let this happen again. Do not be silent. The film is very good. Watch and think."
" True stories and heart touching interviews!
",2020-11-13 00:00:00,10,True stories and heart touching interviews. War is evil. Cannot stop to cry.This people will live with this fear and broken psychology.
" Tears in my eyes!
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,10,"Very Touching Documentary :( Why is the world so rude? Why the people are so rude? I've explored for me the roots of the Karabakh War, about which we are reading so often nowadays."
" Lies deserve a rating lower than 1/10
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,1,"Just another waste of time ""documentary"" by Azerbaijan propaganda paid and sponsored by a dictator to spread lies and disinformation across the world. For a country that ranks almost same as North Korea on freedom of expression, freedom of press, education, where dictatorship is passed on from father to son, where the population is starving yet fed with hatred and lies, this is just another pathetic example to keep dictatorship in line. May this actually cause people to Google reality about this horrible family, the Aliyevs, their horrible influence on educating their people to hate and the barbaric countries of Turkey and Azerbaijan. If I could rate it 0 I would. I wish peace for all of humanity and things like this go against everything civilized people believe in. Skip this and take the time to search your own truth."
" Best documentary ever
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,10,That is really sad to see those innocent people suffered this much.
" One of the best films about genocide.
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,10,"I heard about the killing of civilians in Khojaly by Armenian bandits. But this film opened for me the terrible story of an entire village, wiped off the face of the earth on the night of February 25-26, 1992, from a new side. How cruel people can be. Thanks for the truthful adaptation of the tragedy of the Azerbaijani people."
" False events
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,1,If a film is classified as documentary it should contain facts not imaginary events.
" Must see!
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,10,"This documentary is the one everyone should see in order to understand the nature of the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Most important thing - it is made by neutral party - a journalist from Lithuania, who was not financed by any of the sides of the conflict in Karabakh, Azerbaijan. This is purely a tragedy of modern history as it is - and sometimes you will be shocked to understand that it was only 30 years ago."
" False Story
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,1,"Last year in Iran, the Azerbaijani embassy held a photo exhibition on the ""events"" in Khojaly. The Iranian press exposed a picture presented by the Azerbaijani embassy as being from 1992 in Khojaly, but it was a picture taken sometime around 1915, as registered by the US Library of Congress submitted by American Near East Relief. Worse, the picture was of an Armenian woman grieving over the death of a child near Aleppo, Syria during a real genocide, the genocide of the Armenians."
" Heartbreaking but very real
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,10,The dehumanization that should not happen even during war times...
" A bore
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,1,"Pass. A true bore. I stopped watching within 10 minutes. Yes, that bad."
" NOT TRUE STORY!!!
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,1,Ir's completely absurd and the film is not related to reality.
" Fake fake fake
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,1,Fake news is bad. But fake history is even worse...
" Truly fascinating
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,10,"The things these people have been through made me really mad. It is not easy to talk about such horrifying things even to yourself, but they did it in front of the camera! All they want is to make it visible to the world, all the things they experienced is the violation of human rights. I believe some day this genocide will gain more light on it."
" The film literally touched my heart
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,10,"Karabakh is a historically proved land of Azerbaijan. People who stands with Armenia are ignoring history, ignoring facts, ignoring thousands of brutally murdered innocent people, nearly a million Azerbaijanis that have been forcibly displaced by Armenia."
" True History
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,10,This film is very informative and shows the true face of Karabakh war. We need many films like this to denounce war crimes against civilians. Great thanks to the editors for showing truth about Khojaly.
" MUST WATCH!
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,10,"Heartbreaking, Emotional and very professional documentary based on TRUE facts!"
" Great documentary!
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,10,"Brought tears to my eyes and heart:(
The documentary is about Armenian aggression towards Azerbaijanis.
Highly recommended to watch."
" Excellent production. A real story about people who survived the war.
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,10,"The tragedy in Khojaly occurred at the end of the 20th century, during the war in Karabakh, one of the last human tragedies of our time. I bow to the courage of this journalist. The director very sensitively conveyed to us the suffering people experienced. It is impossible to look without tears. These people still cannot live on like everyone else. The topic of Khojaly should not stop there. Further investigations are needed. Whoever is guilty must be punished. People living in Azerbaijan and Armenia have already understood who was to blame for everything. Because the longer this topic is not covered, the more people will hate each other."
" Brilliant!
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,10,"Real story, real people, world needs to know the truth what happened that time ..."
" A MUST WATCH
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,10,Depicts a true story based in truly tragic events back in 1992
" It's far from reality!!! NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!!!!
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,1,"I don't know why they made a movie that doesn't correspond with reality; please, even though you want to make a movie, at least do some research."
" Recommended
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,10,I strongly recommend you to watch this documentary.
" That's true history
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,10,I'm from Karabakh and I know it feelings. We are fighting in our territory now after 28 years Khojali massacre. I'm proud of my country. Long live Azerbaijan
" Great movies
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,10,This is one of the best movies which describes Armenian vandalism in Khojaly 1992 against Azerbaijani nation. I absolutely recommend to watch it!
" Complete and utter lies. Pure TRASH.
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,1,"It's incredible how a fake place believes it's own lies. Honestly - they should've called themselves azerLIEjan !!!!
It is CLEARLY documented by the EU and NATO and all western countries that the Azeris were the aggressors and committed heinous crimes against countless innocent armenian families.
Their "" President "" was voted as worst person of the year. Look it up."
" The best movie!
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,"The movie based on real facts. The massacre against Azerbaijanis by armenians are as same as in Holocoust, Srebnerica or Rwanda."
" I am my family are one of the another victim in Karabakh, such the people in this film.
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,"The film is heart touchable. When I saw this film, i filled myself such as the story telling me by my parents und grandfather. In Khojaly was one of the biggest genocide of azerbaijanis in 90s by the Amenian Armed Forces. I and my family had to experience this ourself in 1993 in Agdam. Aghdam, another city of Karabakh, is my hometown, where I was born in 1990, which is known as ""ghost town"" or ""caucasian Hiroshima"" after the Armenian vandalism in 1993. I was only 3 years old. Many of may relatives were killed by armenians there. The rest of my family had to flee to the other city in the country. Within 10 years we had to move to 7 apartments in 3 cities, because we didn't have any money or anything a hand, with only clothing, when escaping. Even could not we see the murdered bodies of our other family members any more. Unfortunately, my family and I haven't been able to visit them for 27 years after occupation from Armenia. No any armenian can say this history is false. I and my family was one of the victims in I Karabakh war in 90s with psychological and material loss. The same fate as we saw hundreds of Azerbaijanis in Karabakh."
" Definitely Recommended !
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,The films shows historical facts about the Genocide of Azerbaijanis by Armenia.
" Masterpiece
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,"Being one of those 1million people who left Karabakh , It made me cry and remind me again how traumatic acts we were witness in 90s. Armenian vandalism will never change its essence -It is smth that the Devil couldn't even do the same ones. Today, following the laws of war , mighty Azerbaijan army has been liberating these lands where our skinned children's souls still have been living in, where our tortured dears' shout still has been hearing in, where we lost our heroes in. I have never felt more powerful before as in today."
" Disinformation
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,1,"This is not true story, they are spreading disinformation. Probably the movie is not bad, but it is not true,,"
" Real picture of Khojaly genocide
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,The movie describes vandalism of Armenian terrorists against Azerbaijani civilians in Khojaly. Highly recommend everyone to watch this movie.
" So heartbreaking but worth watching!
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"You need to watch this to understand what really happened in Khojaly in 1992. This story is told from a Lithuanian journalist who visited Khojaly himself, interviewed survivors. It's very touching and realistic, and of course voice of narrator Jeremy Irons can't be beaten."
" Good job
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"That's excellent, you can watch and understand what happened in 1992, Khojaly"
" Heartbreaking, yet brilliant documentary
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,Excellent documentary on the massacre in Khojaly city of Azerbaijan (1992) revealing Armenia's gross human rights violation and ethnic cleansing policy. Truly recommended documentary to understand the Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
" Human tragedy used for cheap propaganda
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,1,"One-sided storytelling, misinterpretation of facts and quotes, dividing the sides of the conflict into good guys and bad guys spreading more hatred."
" Must-see
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"Very interesting documentary! Deserves everyone's attention. In the film, there is an assessment of what happened on both sides, which undoubtedly increases the level of reliability of information."
" Worth every minute you spend watching this movie !
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"Reflecting one of the most bloodiest, shameful pages of 20TH century.
One of the unique works about Khojali Massacre. I strongly recommend ."
" Engrossing movie based on true stories
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"I guess armenians opened yet another battlefield for the cinemamakers, in the reviews, just because Armenian cruelty should be kept hidden. Movie worth watching, actually one of must watch. This is one of the finest depictions of the war. I can't possibly explain the overload of emotions I experienced by watching it. I regret the movie is taken from real life, it's documentary and people had really gone through all these."
" Touching hearts, perfectly presented! Well done!
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"No doubts, this movie is worth watching! This movie shed a light to one of many genocides committed by Armenians against Azerbaijani people. The Khojaly genocide was indeed the worst inhuman act of Armenia. Historically, after mass resettlement of Armenian tribes to the historical territories of Azerbaijan by the Russian Empire in 1813 as per Gulistan treaty and in 1828 Turkmenchay treaty, Armenians started committing massacres against peaceful Azerbaijani people with the purpose of ethnic cleansing and occupying the new lands belonging to Azerbaijan. This is a black page in the history of humanity that we all should know about."
" Truly amazing!
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"It was really sad to watch this movie, but knowing that it's all real and it all only happened less than 30 years ago breaks my heart. My condolences to all the victims of Armenian terrorism."
" Unknown genocide
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"An excellent documentary by Aleksandras Brokas about war, crime, and, most notably, human tragedy. Nothing will bring back those who lost their lives, and the survivors will forget nothing. I just hope that survivors will return to their homes, and the perpetrator will face the consequences."
" Far from reality
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,1,The movie doesn't not represent the reality. After Azerbaijan filled Azeri people with lies and hate toward Armenians now they are trying to do the same with others. Don't waste your time on this move.
" Big Tradegy of Azerbaijan.
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"Great Movie, showing Tradegy of Azeri people, and one of the Ethnic cleansing made by Armenian terrorists during 1990-1994 years."
" Biased
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,1,"One should not exaggerate history, movies must be shot on factual basis and not just information given from one country."
" Great movie!
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,The movie unfolds terrifying stories of victims of Khojaly Genocide committed by Armenian military in February 1992 in Nagorno-Karabakh of Azerbaijan.
" What an awfully absurd theme
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,1,This is definitely the most disappointing movie and a true waste of money.
" Meh. Seems biased
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,2,This movie seems like a setup propaganda that is all of the sudden is being promoted now 6 years later when Azerbaijan is committing genocide level crimes back up by Turkey. We watched the movie with the entire family and had a long discussion and came to conclusion that this is a very biased view of one side only.
" Nonsense not believable.
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,1,"In fact, all this was not so, a lot of invented one-sided position,"
" 10/10
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"Amazing documentary! 10/10. True footage, real people and places."
" Ordinary, poorly executed
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,"The script was poorly executed. Overall, it is quite hard to film documentary themed movies. The subject itself is rather controversial and despite of one sided accusations I could hardly find a reliable source of information on this regard.The cinematography was again quite ordinary."
" waste of time
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,Taking out the trash would be better use of my time then watching this...
" TRUTH THAT BREAKS HEARTS
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely outstanding and heartbreaking. When you realise some people went through this horror, you change once and forever. This black page in the history of humankind cannot and shoulf not be forgiven or forgot. My standing ovation to Jeremy Irons for spreading truth about Khojaly massacre even in the face of continues threats of armenian lobby. Thousands of Azerbaijanis were ethnically cleansed that day and the world shoul know the truth about it."
" One-sided perspective
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,The events are presented one-sided and taken out of context.
" A boring government made documentary
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,Just a boring documentary based on exaggerated events. I had to watch this during the recent Genocide of Armenians in 2020 and current conflict in Artsakh.
" Not recommended!!!
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,"This film contains blatantly distorted facts, it would be right to put it in the fantasy film genre."
" Does not match reality!!!
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,"The story is untrue and distorted. Many photo proofs are taken from earthquakes and even from the Genocide of Armenians in 1915. The so called ""massacre of Khodjaly"" is invented aiming to present the Armenian nation as ennemy. This is unreal documentary film which includes the elements of hatred propaganda towards Armenia."
" Lack of sincerity
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,"By distorting history, it is impossible to falsify reality, lack of historical arguments, comprehensive approach, baseless lies. In order to get a rating film, you need to study the history in more depth, exclude bias and be honest with your own observer."
" Disappointing, don't recommend
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,"This movie being of a historical content, contains information that is not accurate. For a historical movie, it lacks evidence and is rather biased. Very disappointed, don't recommend watching if you're a historic fanatic."
" Khojaly genocide
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,It is impossible to watch without tears ((and it really happened.
" True story of Khojaly genocide
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,"While watching the lives of victims of Khojaly genocide you can't stop crying! If you want to get real facts, highly recommend to watch this documentary!"
" Great Documentary movies
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,"Finally,founded the best movies that deal with and shown reality about Khodjaly massacre."
" Boring
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,"Don't waste your time, this is garbage.
Lack of plot
Bad characterizations and casting
Movies that stand for nothing
Lag in the story
Repeating the same story over and over
Poor cinematography
cheap special effects
dragged out action sequences
unrealistic dialogue
unbelievable romance
dull scenery"
" Jeremy Irons gets 2 stars, the movie gets 0
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,2,"Ok, so I actually watched the movie, unlike probably 90% of the people posting reviews here. Unfortunately, there's an entire campaign where people are urged to create fake user accounts in IMDB and rate the movie with some copy-paste review. Most of the people posting those 10 star reviews haven't watch the movie and are just doing what they are told to do. It's sad that IMDB is becoming yet another platform for shady political agenda.Anyway, being totally unbiassed, as I'm neither Armenian nor Azeri, and having a considerable history knowledge (read books people, other than Facebook!) I was hoping to actually watch some more or less accurate documentary, with facts and data. Instead I was served with d-rated propaganda movie that had practically zero historic accuracy. Clearly the movie was made for purely propaganda purpose. I'm only giving it 2 stars because of Jeremy Irons, I can't even imagine how they could lure him in such a low quality production. All the rest is not even worth mentioning, the movie is a joke and a total waste of an hour of your life."
" Lies
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,"This is funny acting at its best. The cast is not selected properly, the director has no direction and the story line is based on complete lies when researching. No I won't recommend this."
" One of the most impressive historical documentaries
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,It is even to watch. Imagine people have experienced all of this. I suggest you watch and learn about the sad but true history of Azerbaijan.
" Great movie
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,Very professional historical truth covered by documentary filming .. Bravo !!
" Low quality
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,A low quality film. Some political propaganda. I just wasted my time :(
" One of the best documentary I've ever seen
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,"I understand why armenians gives it 1 star, because the truth is always tough to accept if you don't want to face your conscience at the end of the day."

",2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,"Many people are interested what is the problem between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Those people can watch this film to be aware of what is the real reason behind today's Nagorno Karabakh War 2. This film is about a true story - how Armenia was mass murdered hundreds of civilians from Nagorno Karabakh back in the 90th with the help of Russia and how they kicked of local people from their homeland, claiming that this is their ancient lands and no one besides Armenians can live here. Now we are coming to our home with the liberation from the Armenian occupation of our homeland. Justice should focus on repairing this harm. Strongly recommended!"

With regards to all, this documentary is a quite vital piece of media which did a great job at portraying the tragedy that had affected many innocent azerbaijani locals of Khojaly and is still being mourned by our nation after 30 years. Definitely a must watch!"

Still people of Armenia who committed this International crime have been living their lives without being accused and guilty of this mass crime by World ; however, the side of Azerbaijan still suffers from this Genocide and the World has been silent in this regard.

The first serious confrontation broke out in 1905-1906 and the first genocide committed by Armenians against civilian Azerbaijanis in 1918-1920. Armenians do not want to accept that they were moved to Azerbaijan after 1828 and continue alleged territorial claim which only serves bloodshed.

""When i and Khachtur entered the house, our soldiers had nailed a 13th years old Turkish child to the window. He was making much noise so Khachtur put mother's cut breast into his mouth. I skinned his chest and belly. Seven minutes later the child died. My soul was proud for taking 1 percent of vengeance of my nation. Then Khachtur cut the body into pieces and threw it to a dog of same origin with Turks.I did the same to three Turkish children in the evening.I did my duty as an Armenian patriot.Khachtur had sweated much.The next day we went to a church to clean our souls from what done previous day.But we were able to clear Khojaly from slops of 30 thousand people."""

" Pure fantasy with an awful cast
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"Seeing the good comments decided to watch this film but God this was nonsense. It is indicated that the film is a documentary but it is a pure fantasy even not close to a fairytale, no historical fact at all. Then I went back to the reviews and guess what? It's only Azerbaijani and Turkish that recommend the movie. So find a better way to spend your one hour and do not waste it on this film. Besides the false content, the cast is also horrible, how could they have selected these people? So this is the worst and most unprofessionally directed movie I have seen recently."

" A lesson to be learnt.
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,8,"This documentary clearly shows us the outcomes of hatred and injustice. Hate leads to violence and violence leads to more violence. Injustice itself leads to hatred. 28 years passed since those horrible events. Yet this vicious cycle is not broken. Yet this story is remaining unspoken, the documentary is constantly being deleted from free sources, and the massacre itself is not valued properly. And the instigators of these events are still not judged for their crimes. This documentary shows us that anger and ignorance will never be a solution. Violators should accept the truth and answer for their crimes. Only this will be the start of a bright future for all of us."

The Khojaly massacre, also known as the Khojaly tragedy, was the mass murder of at least 161 ethnic Azerbaijani civilians from the town of Khojaly on 26 February 1992. According to the Azerbaijani side, as well as the Memorial Human Rights Center, Human Rights Watch and other international observers, the massacre was committed by the ethnic Armenian armed forces, as well as some military personnel of the 366th CIS regiment who were not acting on orders from their command. The death toll claimed by Azerbaijani authorities is 613 civilians, including 106 women and 63 children. The event became the largest massacre in the course of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict."

" Uncomfortable truth
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,"This documentary portrays the mass killing of Azerbaijani civilians in Khojaly, one of towns around Nagorno-Karabakh, which was subjected to occupation and ethnic cleansing by the Armenian Armed Forces during the first Karabakh war. The painful reality of Khojaly is sadly only one of many acts of brutality of against the native civilians of Azerbaijan, which remain largely unacknowledged in today's media space. Yet the suffering and trauma of Khojaly's survivors is still fresh after 28 years of no justice and no hope to return"

",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"A fake plot of the film, another false Azerbaijani propaganda. All educated and adequate people understand that Aliyev and his mafia oil gang sponsored this deceitful film. There was no genicide, it's just that the Azerbaijani people have mania and the habit of ascribing everything Armenian to themselves! The international community has now clearly stated that the Azerbaijani-Turkish alliance is waging a war against Artsakh and Armenia with the help and involvement of foreign terrorist fighters.The whole world knows that Nagorno-Karabakh has never been part of independent Azerbaijan. In 1921, Stalin decided to ""annex"", and I would say to GIFT Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan, and after the collapse of the USSR Artsakh did not want to remain in its composition. Artsakh gained its independence together with other countries of the former USSR.All over the territory of Artsakh there are temples and churches of the 4-19 centuries, this testifies to the fact that ethnic Armenians lived, live and will live there for centuries!"
" I don't recommend watching this movie

" Endless low quality film

" Another Azerbaijani FAKE
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"This is a propaganda film made with Azerbaijani petrodollars, which is based on a false representation of horrible events. The events in Khojaly are very vague (you can read about it even in Wikipedia). They took place in 1992, during the war, and a month later the former President of Azerbaijan A. Mutalibov said in an interview that they were organized by the Azerbaijani secret forces to make him resign. And even if we admit that they were committed by some rogue Armenians, it was definitely a savage self-activity of those criminals, which can only be condemned at the state level and by all Armenians, unlike the massacres of Sumgait (1988), Baku ( 1990), Maragha (1992) etc. (note the chronology! they were before Khojaly), which were carefully organized by the Azerbaijani authorities and widely appreciated by Azerbaijani population. If an Armenian kills an innocent Azerbaijani he will be considered as a criminal by all the Armenians. Instead, Azerbaijan glorifies as a hero a criminal like Ramil Safarov, who at night axed his sleeping Armenian comrade during a NATO peacekeeping mission just because he was Armenian. And such a criminal is considered a hero in Azerbaijan. In Azerbaijan killing an Armenian is considered as an ""heroic"" act. Azerbaijan wants to cover up its own genocidal purposes and genocidal past with such propaganda films."

" Poor! That's fake story!
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"This is what happened in Khojaly. For most of 1991 and early 1992 the Azeri OMON (Special Purpose Militia Detachment) had systematically shelled Armenian civilian targets, using rockets. The Azeris had also blockaded the nearby airport. As a result of Azeri attacks, Armenians had suffered civilian casualties, hundreds had been kidnapped and thousands of cattle had been driven away. The blockade had also resulted in lack of food, fuel and medical supplies, especially in Stepanakert, the capital of Artsakh. Armenian forces had to neutralize Azeri fire in Khojaly and terminate the blockade. It was also obvious to the Armenians that the Azeris were planning to attack the Armenian centre of Askeran before moving on to the capital.Using loudspeakers for ten days, the Armenian forces announced to Khojaly inhabitants (mostly Meskhetian Turks who had been settled in the village during Soviet times) and forces that an Armenian attack was imminent. The announcements also informed Azeris that Armenians had dedicated a corridor for the safe passage of civilians to Azeri-held areas. But the Azeri authorities did nothing to facilitate the evacuation of their people.On Feb. 25, at 11:30 p.m. the Armenian self-defence forces attacked Khojaly. A number of Azeri civilians tried to flee through the corridor. However, Azeri forces fired at the column, killing an unknown number. Although the Armenians were successful in neutralizing the Azeri fire- power, Khojaly remained in Azeri hands for many months.Soon after the attack, Azeri authorities claimed that Armenians had committed not only genocide by firing at the fleeing Azeris but had also mutilated the bodies of the dead. Although there was no shred of evidence for their allegation, Azeri authorities repeated the charge. In recent months they've decided to turn the Khojaly operation into the focus of a full-court anti-Armenian campaign. As a result, Baku has achieved a number of ""propaganda and political victories:"""

",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,This film is centered around the Khojaly genocide commuted by Russian backed Armenian army against innocent civilians in Azerbaijan. Not knowing about the conflict and seeing this film really shows the viciousness of mankind. It sheds light upon the sad reality of the Nagorno Karabakh war that caused the death of 30 000 Azerbaijanis and the mass ethnic cleansing of nearly 1 MILLION from both Armenia and the illegally occupied Karabakh and it's adjacent districts. The inhumaine conditions through which these people had to live and the endless suffering of a nation really broke my heart. I call on everyone to listen to Azerbaijani people for once instead of following mainstream media. These people deserve justice for the endless corridor of hopelessness and torture cannot last longer.

I dont know. Please go watch the intervies of foreign journalists like Dana Mazalova, or azerbayjani reporter Chingiz Mustafayev, who was there, who filmed this all, and noticed different things. He started to ask questions to their own government, because he knew that blood of this people is on their hands. And guess what he was killed. Do u have that in ur ""documentary""? no. This is real tragedy, very dishisting. But I will always tell the truth. Your government, your politics they all lie to use your anger against us, armenians not against them. So very bad.

",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,"Marvelous piece of work by the team, definitely recommending you to watch. It contains state of the art simulations of the events that unfolded in Southern Caucasus following the occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh by Armenia. It's really disastrous situation that we sometime can't tolerate seeing images of Khojaly Genocide or other cruelties whereas those people have lived it. Hearing their stories broke my heart very much. My condolences... 🙏🏻"
" This is an another false story from Azerbaijan
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"This is another lie from the series of lies that Azerbaijan is spreading every day. It is not based on the true history. The truth is that during the war of 1992 armenian settlements were continously shelled from Khojalu by Azerbaijan army. During this period tere were more than 700 captives from armenians in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan closed all ways of communication for armenians - it was winter but there was no fuel, no electricity, no water and even no food. And armenians started to suffer from hunger. There was only one way to survive for armenians in Kharabakh and it was to occupy Khojalu and not let Azerbaijani to continue shelling anymore. But before that armenians gave a corridor for Azerbaijani civilians to escape. And Azerbaijan management was aware of that but as usual they didn't care about their civilians and didn't organize anything for the civilians to be safe. However, there were only 11 civilians died in Khojalu, the hundred azerbaijani civilians died 10-11km far away from Khojalu in Aghdam where Azerbaijani army was controlling and there was no armenian army at that time. So it was most probably done by mistake of Azerbaijani army itself. And as usual till now Azerbaijan is staging cheap and false shows trying to hide the truth from their civilians and international community."
" Not true story

" Real truth! Must see.
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,Rare circumstances where a film describes the real story.
" Don't waste your time on dictatorship propaganda
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"Reporter Dana Mazalova who interviewed former president of Azerbaijan Ayaz Mutalibov and published the article in ""Nezavisimaya Gazeta"" reaffirms that irrespective of the efforts of the incumbent president of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev to distort the reality, her article is in full compliance with what former Azerbaijani president Ayaz Mutalibov said during the interview which took place in April, 1992.
One month after the Khojaly tragedy Azerbaijani president Ayaz Mutalibov was interviewed by Czech reporter Dana Mazalova. - What would you say about the Khojaly events, after which you resigned? At the time, bodies of people from Khojaly were discovered not far from Aghdam. Someone had shot them in the legs beforehand to prevent them from running away. Afterwards they were axed. On February 29th my colleagues filmed them. When we next filmed on March 2 these corpses had been scalped. What kind of strange game was that?
As the rescued residents of Khojaly say, all that was organized to create grounds for my resignation. I don't think that the Armenians, who had manifested a clear and knowledgeable approach to such situations, would have allowed Azerbaijanis to obtain evidence that tied them to fascist acts. If I declare that it was the fault of the Azerbaijani opposition I could be blamed for slander. But the overall picture of the conclusions is as follows: the Armenians had, in any case, provided a corridor to let the civilians escape. Why then would they shoot? As soon as Khojaly was surrounded by tanks it was necessary to immediately lead the civilians out. Earlier I had given similar orders regarding Shushi - to evacuate women and children and to leave only men in the city. It's one of the laws of war - civilians must be rescued. My conduct was appropriate and unambiguous - I gave such orders, but why they weren't followed in Khojaly is not clear to me."
" Bad movie
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,This film does not correspond to reality. It was supposed to tell about real events whereas in movie something invented is shown.
" I'm only gonna say- LOW QUALITY PRODUCT.

",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,"The film is based on Khojali massacre committed by armenia toward unarmed Azerbaijani civilians in 26 February 1992. Due to graphic restrictions movie doesnt cover the some scenes that show how brutally armenians killed women, children, elderly people! World must see this level of armenian vandalism!"
" One of the best documentaries ever watched
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,This movie is a must watch for people who want to learn more about Khojaly Genocide and first Kharabakh War. It perfectly depicts why Khojaly events are the pain of all Azerbaijanis and banned topic for discussion in Armenia.

" The reality is different
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"This is nothing but dirty Azerbaijani propaganda that has not anything common with the reality. They turned Khojalu into a national brand. Khojalu massacres were organized by azeris themselves in the territories controlled by them. The massacred people had already passed the humanitarian corridor granted by Armenians and were killed by azeris on the lands under the azeri control. Why would Armenians grant humanitarian corridir if they intended to kill these civilians? Chingiz Mustafaev, an azeri journalist himself told a lot of truth ehat happened in reslity and he was killed by the azeri authorities."
" It's not true

" Depiction of false events
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"Azeri civilians were used as pawns by their own government in order to capitalize on a massacre and sell the story of Armenian brutality. The bodies of the victims of Khojaly were tampered with post-mortem, to exacerbate the level of brutality and to pitch accusations of the extreme cruelty against Armenians. Azerbaijan has committed much worse to Armenians systematically, yet no one bats an eye. Since they have more resources to bribe many figures, they create a false narrative of what actually went down in history."
" Another Fake interpretation
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,The crime was implemented by Azerbaijanis themself and then blaming Armenians.
" The essence of the Armenian people
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,One thing I understood after watching this film that every human being should stay away from armenians all over the world. Doing such kind of brutality to neighbor (human) is not something that the world can forget.

Everyone should know about Khojaly genocide and occupation of Azerbaijani lands in early 90s by Armenia. What they did to unarmed civilians was genocide and ethnic cleansing. Bloody pages of history should not be forgotten and Armenia should answer for its heinous crimes.

" A sham of a documentary
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,2,"TL;DR - Historically incorrect, bad acting and cinematography infused trash.
The movie poses itself as a documentary, however is totally and utterly misrepresenting history. It completely overlooks testimonies of people like Ayez Mutalibov (First Azerbaijani president) and Fatullaev, both of whom admit that a corridor was provided and was open for people of Khojali to leave. Azerbaijani forces however refused to evacuate them.
This paired with atrocious cinematography and sub-par acting makes this movie not worth anyone's time."

" misleading movie
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"This is a fake story written by a person, who was not aware about this war. The film does not cover the true mass murders by the Azerbaijani side. More than a thousand Armenians were killed by the Azeris in 1993 in the same way, which was organized few days ago in Lion and Nice .
Many Armenian families lost their homes. They hurt us using the most painful tactics, such as killing or raping kids infront of parents. Their only goal is to finish what they started on 1915.
By showing this movie you encourage these people to feel free to perform murders against Christians."

The armenian side justified this using the 'armenian genocide', suggesting that two wrongs can indeed make a right, which is not the case, at least in a civilized world.RECOMMENDED!"

" Ilham Aliyev lies - claims reporter who interviewed former Azerbaijani president on Khojaly events
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"Reporter Dana Mazalova who interviewed former president of Azerbaijan Ayaz Mutalibov and published the article in ""Nezavisimaya Gazeta"" reaffirms that irrespective of the efforts of the incumbent president of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev to distort the reality, her article is in full compliance with what former Azerbaijani president Ayaz Mutalibov said during the interview which took place in April, 1992.The reporter regrets that she was unable to preserve the recording due to technical reasons.""There was no internet, there were no computers, but I reaffirm that what I wrote back then are what Ayaz Mutalibov said, I have not added anything. Now he can deny it as he wants, but he said it the way it is printed in ""Nezavisimaya Gazeta"" newspaper. I have the copy of that newspaper and its available on the net, Ayaz Mutalibov has said it"", Dana Mazalova said in an exclusive interview with ARMENPRESS. Mutalibov gave an interview to Dana Mazalova after 1 month following his resignation.Mazalova heard about the tragic events of Khojaly from the video recordings of cameraman Chingiz Mustafayev, who had personally made exclusive records. ""Chingiz, whom I met in Kislovodsk, told me in his apartment how those people were killed, they were hurting their knees so they couldn't go. The knees... the most vulnerable place on human's body. I was scheduled to take an interview from Ayaz Mutalibov the next day. I could not help asking him what I had seen in the records made by Chingiz. Of course, I did not say the name of my friend Chingiz not to harm him. After 2 months Chingiz was killed"", the reporter recalls with grief.Dana Mazalova told also about another recording of Chingiz Mustafayev. The bodies of the victims of Khojaly events were seen in a video recording done on February 28 in front of the military positions of the ""Popular Front"" of Azerbaijani troops. According to Muslim traditions, the bodies should have been buried within two days, but Chingiz Mustafayev could record them also on March 2, but this time the bodies were taken to another place and were vandalized. In the video recording of February 28 it could be seen that Azerbaijani soldiers were walking near the bodies.""I feel very guilty for not taking and copying those recordings. I feel so sorry up till now. I think you understand that my interview with Mutalibov was the result of those video recordings and my conversations with Chingiz"", Mazalova said.To the remark of the reporter of ARMENPRESS that incumbent president of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev used the public platform of Munich Security Conference on February 15 to deny the words of Mutalibov, Mazalova emphasized, ""I will put this way. We know that Turkey denies the Armenian Genocide up till now"".One month after the Khojaly tragedy Azerbaijani president Ayaz Mutalibov was interviewed by Czech reporter Dana Mazalova.
What would you say about the Khojaly events, after which you resigned? At the time, bodies of people from Khojaly were discovered not far from Aghdam. Someone had shot them in the legs beforehand to prevent them from running away. Afterwards they were axed. On February 29th my colleagues filmed them. When we next filmed on March 2 these corpses had been scalped. What kind of strange game was that?As the rescued residents of Khojaly say, all that was organized to create grounds for my resignation. I don't think that the Armenians, who had manifested a clear and knowledgeable approach to such situations, would have allowed Azerbaijanis to obtain evidence that tied them to fascist acts. If I declare that it was the fault of the Azerbaijani opposition I could be blamed for slander. But the overall picture of the conclusions is as follows: the Armenians had, in any case, provided a corridor to let the civilians escape. Why then would they shoot? As soon as Khojaly was surrounded by tanks it was necessary to immediately lead the civilians out. Earlier I had given similar orders regarding Shushi - to evacuate women and children and to leave only men in the city. It's one of the laws of war - civilians must be rescued. My conduct was appropriate and unambiguous - I gave such orders, but why they weren't followed in Khojaly is not clear to me."

" The truth about Khojaly.
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"For several decades, Azerbaijan has been trying to present the events in Khojaly as massacres of civilians by the Armenians. In autumn 1991, Azerbaijan was besieged by Stepanakert. Khojaly was one of the 5-6 main firing points from which the capital was shelled (moreover, the Meskhetian Turks living in Khojaly say that the Azerbaijanis fired from their homes. And the return fire of the Armenians could destroy them. They asked to shoot from others points, but in vain). It was necessary to liberate Khojaly in order to unblock Stepanakert, stop the shelling and save the population from a humanitarian disaster. Khojalu was one of the goals of the NKR Defense Army. They started talking about this long before the operation and Khojaly residents were warned about hostilities, they must be evacuated for the safety of residents, and also informed about the exit from the humanitarian corridor on the Khojaly-Askeran-Aghdam highway, about which the civilian population could leave Khojaly. (In other words, in a state of war, we showed humanity, reported the attack early enough and left the corridor to evacuate the residents.) The first cause of death was the criminal activity of the political elite of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The inhabitants of Khojaly were used as human shields. The authorities hoped that the Armenian side would not attack Khojaly because of the civilian population, and if this happens, they will retaliate against the Armenians. This was confirmed by the chairman of the commission for the investigation of these cases, Ramiz Fatali (deputy of the Milli Majlis). He notes that at a meeting of the convened National Security Council it was decided that the eviction of residents would mean inviting Armenians to the village.
To justify their actions in the future, the Baku authorities choose the simplest explanation, stating that the Armenians did not leave the corridor. There was a corridor, people reached the end of the corridor and entered the territory controlled by the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan. Not reaching these places, the people who left Khojaly were harmless. BUT for some reason several groups of leaving Khojaly residents were transferred to the other side. The question arises, why?
The bodies of civilians in Khojaly are being filmed for the first time by the Azerbaijani cameraman Chingiz Mustafa. The bodies were found 10-11 km from Khojaly, opposite the AZERBAIJANI POSITIONS in Aghdam. The video shows the armed forces of Azerbaijan. Mustafa simply could not shoot in the area if he was under the control of the Karabakh forces. It is unclear how the Armenian forces could have annihilated the civilian population in the area under the control of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces. By the way, Mustafa dies a month after showing his footage.
The corpses were left in the open air for several days. A few days after Chingiz was photographed, he returned to the same place and saw that many of the bodies had been mutilated. And the Armenians were unable to get to the territory controlled by the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan to disfigure the victims.
In an interview, the first president of Azerbaijan Ayaz Mutalibov not only mentioned the existence of a ""free corridor"", but also said that the Azerbaijani opposition was behind the massacre of the civilian population in order to remove it from the presidency.Mutalibov. ""According to survivors from Khojaly, all this was organized to create a pretext for my resignation. If I say that this is the fault of the Azerbaijani opposition, then they can say that I am slandering. However, the general picture of the court decisions is as follows: the Armenians, nevertheless, left a corridor through which people could leave. Then why should they shoot?"

It is must watch for anyone who is strong enough to see such cruel scenes and who wants some non-fiction histpry. I have always heard about this massacre and saw many videos on it. I cant describe the sadness I felt after watching it. I m sorry for azerbaijani people who suffered.
" This is true history.
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,"It's a real story, very well filmed. It's very sad and hard to watch."
" Unabashedly lying
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"The movie isn't based on historical facts, it's a mere falsification of the facts without taking responsibility about two sides people, it doesn't even have any closeness to the reality, so whenever you watch it, please do some research on the matter"

" Fake information
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,This is totally falsification of the history... Armenians never killed people im Khojalu. There are even more facts. This is part of Aliev propaganda and they spent a lot of money just to make history without evidence. And this documentary movie is part of that propaganda.
" False information!
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,Whole film is about inaccurate history :(( It just shares false and fake information and watching is a total waste of time.
" This story is fake and Azerbaijani propaganda.

" I could not watch it without tears.
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,People who continued life after this tragedy are heroes! Everyone should know about Khojaly so that this will not happen again.
" Real story! Excellent!

" Movie is an Azerbaijan propaganda
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,I wouldn't call this film a historic one. The movie includes false information and Azerbaijan propaganda.
" It's not true
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"On the contrary, it is the Turks and Azerbaijanis who committed genocide several times, remember 1915 when 1,500,000 Armenians were killed and hundreds of Armenians were killed in Sumgait"
" Fake story
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"Absolutely fake story. Do not waste your time. I dont like it. You can watch film promise instead of this one, which is based on facts and represents real story of real peoples in our world."
" The film is representing fake facts
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"Better visit Armenia Genocide Museum, you will know all the truth about 1915 Genocide, will see a lot of photos and documentary films"
" fake, is not based on real facts ! ! !

" Great documentary of the massacre
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,This movie is set as a documentary from eyes of the people who happened to be there and record the carnage & massacre committed by the Armenian army in 1992. It contains real footage from the events and story of the people who witnessed it either as observers or participants. This is a good movie to watch to familiarize yourself with the Nagorno Karabakh conflict history and the nationalist & fascist movement that Armenia had close to the collapse of the USSR. That hate ultimately led to the worst tragedy of the 90s and Azerbaijan's modern history.
" Lying story
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"All the facts presented in this film were fictional by the Azerbaijani authorities.They did this specifically to poison the Azerbaijani people against the Armenian people.In 1992, our fighters in the valley corridor wanted them to take their residents out of Khojaly, but they deliberately left them under bombardment to die then they mocked their bodies and showed like the Armenians did it.
In the same way, they do from today they put their military facilities in settlements, then they complain that the Armenians are bombing the settlements."
" False information
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,The Azerbaijani Journalist Chingiz Mustafaev was shocked to see that the Azerbaijani side killed these people to stop the international conference about Nagorno Karabakh conflict. Meanwhile président Muralibov also admitted thzt it was done by Azerbaijani soldiers in the territory under the control of Azerbaijan to take the power... there are all the records and videos available... so it's a fake Azerbaijani propaganda...
" Film tries to fake the history.
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"The film is part of the azerbaijani propaganda. Doesn't have anything to do with reality. It's absolutely unacceptable to call this film ""historical""."
" Armenian Terror has no limits
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,"Khodjaly is one of the most cruel pages of Azerbaijan history. Unfortunately we have terrorist nation hosted nearby. Last 200 years of our co-existence in Azerbaijan brought a lot of cruelties in our modern history. Armenians are afraid of this reality. We were waiting for 30 years for the world to hear about Armenian crimes! Some of them really don't believe that they could do this, but most of Armenians even like it. Their national identity and ideology is based on falsified history as they are doing now with the rating of this film, spreading terror by their Echmiadzin church, killing Turks Nation with such ideology will always suffer because of their crimes.This criminal barbarian nation is acting the same way now shelling Ganja and Barda. As of now 90 civilians died and more than 300 hundred Azerbaijanis were wounded. Thanks for this film!"
" Khojaly genocide
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,"In 1991 Armenian troops started the occupation of Azerbaijani lands. In 1992 Armenians did Khojaly genocide in which people were killed ruthlessly. The Khojaly Massacre is seen as one of the bloodiest incidents committed by Armenian forces against Azerbaijani civilians for control of the now-occupied Upper Karabakh region. The Armenian offensive killed 613 Azerbaijani citizens- including 106 women, 63 children, and 70 elderly. 487 were critically injured, 1275 were taken hostage, 150 of which remain missing till today. This wasn't just mass murder of civilians but torture towards every single Khojaly citizen. Imagine a mother suffocating her child in order to make him/her silent so that Armenian soldiers don't hear. Imagine a pregnant woman getting stabbed. Imagine a child getting killed in front of his father. Just imagine this and you will understand how tragic effect this genocide had on population.WE REMEMBER
KHOJALY!
25-26 FEBRUARY
1992613 people killed, Including:
63 children;

During the retreat of Azeri Army, before attacking Army enters, the Azeri soldiers attacked and murdered everyone who wanted to stay, calling them traitors. The Azerbaujan sent filming crews before arrived Armenian Army the village, to shoot the dead and retreat. Such a pity that Irons went on for this, the film is total distortion of a tragedy."

" Too much political propoganda
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"Unfortunately too much political propaganda is packed in this movie and very biased ... Sad. The plot seems to be rich at first sight but why on earth the producers chose to depict most of the events in such lopsided view is beyond comprehension. Script is completely based on anti-Armenian point of view. It's purely -and unquestionably- based upon Azerbaijan's so-called ""valid"" arguments. If you research the subject you will know the actual events... This Khojaly subject is particularly escalated by wealthy Azerbaijani and government backers and their attempts will continue, that's for sure. If you are looking for a decent movie with a good script and respectable acting, you will be disappointed as this is a biased turd with diamonds and jewels encrusted onto it. In my opinion, script is a piece of crap, but film itself looks beautiful here and there, and visually appealing. But story-wise, it represents nothing new, except same old rubbish and bias as usual.."
" Must watch
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,Just note that all the bad reviews are coming from users of Armenian origin. If something draws some much attention it's logical that it's very true or very fake.

" Khojaly . The real truth
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"From the first days of the war against Karabakh, the cities of Shushi, Aghdam, Stepanakert, Khojaly, Malibeyli and other Azerbaijani settlements became the firing points of the capital of Artsakh and the nearby Armenian villages around the clock. The only airport connecting Artsakh with the outside world was located in the village of Khojaly, populated by Meskhetian Turks, which the Azeris had turned into the center of the Omani armed to the teeth. Russian journalist Angelika Chechina writes about those days. ""I was in Stepanakert from January 21 to 25. There was no electricity or water in the city. Water was so difficult to obtain that you were ashamed to drink tea. It was impossible to sell food stamps, the shops were empty. There were already cases of starvation and death in the city. ""Stepanakert was reminiscent of the blockade of Leningrad.""
The destruction of the Khojaly firing points was undertaken by the Karabakh self-defense forces on February 26, 1992. According to independent observers and journalists, before the attack, Armenians, acting in accordance with the Geneva Conventions, used loudspeakers to urge residents to leave the city and get out of the encirclement through a humanitarian corridor along the Karkar River. According to the people of Khojaly, they used that corridor, and indeed the Armenian soldiers on the other side of the corridor did not open fire on them.
Azerbaijani journalist Eynulla Fatullayev writes about those days. "": Getting acquainted with the geographical location, I can say with all confidence that the allegations about the absence of the Armenian corridor are baseless. There really was a corridor, otherwise the people of Khojaly, completely surrounded and isolated from the outside world, would not be able to break through the circle and get out of the encirclement. However, on the other side of the Karkar River, a line of refugees was dispersed, and, for some reason, some of the Khojaly people were directed, or more precisely, directed by some people in the direction of Nakhichevanik. It seemed that the battalions of the People's Front of Azerbaijan were not seeking the liberation of the Khojaly people, but to shed more blood on the way to overthrow Mutalibov. : The strange and annoying thing is that under the torrential fire of the Armenians, our helicopters, which had difficulty reaching the entrances of Aghdam, were hastily transporting the animals and not the residents who were somehow rescued and arrived here. Who gave them such a terrifying task? Armenians..."":
The author of the article was arrested and convicted on charges of ""insulting Khojaly residents."" New charges have been brought after the arrest, and in 2007 In late October, Fatullayev was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison. These testimonies were later officially considered ""false"" and ""traitor"".
Making Khojaly the subject of speculation, the Azeris, or more precisely, the Popular Front (led by Elchibey), and later father and son Aliyev, discredited and ousted incumbent President Ayaz Mutalibov in order to seize the coveted presidency, then in Baku, Sumgait, Kirovab, Azerbaijan. In order to counterbalance the genocide committed against the Armenian population in other settlements, false accusations were made against the Armenians, as if they had also carried out a massacre in the village of Khojaly.
In fact, the following happened. Analysis of foreign, Armenian and Azerbaijani independent sources, the words of the first president of Azerbaijan Ayaz Mutalibov shows that the representatives of the opposition People's Front in Aghdam deliberately misled the residents of Khojaly and the retreating military groups, directing them as Armenians liberated by Azeris instead of Aghdam. Clashing with the village self-defense forces and inflicting several dozen casualties, the panicked Azeris fled to Aghdam. It is near Aghdam that the mass murders of Azeris take place at the hands of their own people who have received a special assignment. This area is 3.5 kilometers away from Aghdam and 11 kilometers from Khojaly, until the end of July 1993 it was under the constant control of the Azerbaijani armed forces. Needless to say, the presence of Armenian detachments in that area was impossible. The Azeri soldiers confused their own soldiers retreating in the dark and the people of Khojaly with the attacking Armenians and set them on fire. Then the corpses of the people freely ""adapted"" to their goals."
" The fakest film I've ever saw
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"Everything in this film is fake.
This is about the events happened almost 30 years ago, when Armenians provided a corridor for Azeri peaceful people to cross the fire line and live in Azerbaijan.
Reality is that Azeris killed their women, old people and kids when they were already on Azerbaijan's land and held the bodies for over 2 MONTHS!!!! to show the bodies to 2 delegations to ruin the negotiations for peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan. They told that Armenians killed all of them...
All real facts had been collected by Azeri pilot and neutral Czech political journalist/analyst.
Now they continue the fake propaganda with the films to continue to ruin all possible ways to make peace and continue killing the civilians."

" Another falsification of history by Azerbaijan
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"Artsakh (Karabakh) has never been in the territory of independent Azerbaijan which was artificially created and integrated in the USSR.
Artsakh has been populated with Armenians for millenniums and Azerbaijan cannot simply claim Artsakh as a part of its territory.One month after the Khojaly tragedy Azerbaijani president Ayaz Mutalibov was interviewed by Czech reporter Dana Mazalova.
What would you say about the Khojaly events, after which you resigned? At the time, bodies of people from Khojaly were discovered not far from Aghdam. Someone had shot them in the legs beforehand to prevent them from running away. Afterwards they were axed. On February 29th my colleagues filmed them. When we next filmed on March 2 these corpses had been scalped. What kind of strange game was that?As the rescued residents of Khojaly say, all that was organized to create grounds for my resignation. I don't think that the Armenians, who had manifested a clear and knowledgeable approach to such situations, would have allowed Azerbaijanis to obtain evidence that tied them to fascist acts. If I declare that it was the fault of the Azerbaijani opposition I could be blamed for slander. But the overall picture of the conclusions is as follows: the Armenians had, in any case, provided a corridor to let the civilians escape. Why then would they shoot? As soon as Khojaly was surrounded by tanks it was necessary to immediately lead the civilians out. Earlier I had given similar orders regarding Shushi - to evacuate women and children and to leave only men in the city. It's one of the laws of war - civilians must be rescued. My conduct was appropriate and unambiguous - I gave such orders, but why they weren't followed in Khojaly is not clear to me."
" A falsified Story
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,"This film has nothing in common with reality. It is yet another expression of Azerbaijan's leadership to endemically voice their own interpretation of history in a way that easily resembles Goebbels' big lie: ""if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it."" It is one more falsification of the history of Azerbaijan. They continue to distort the facts surrounding the bloody events near the city of Agdam, which they call the ""Khojaly tragedy"". The mere facts of those events raise many questions, and the Azerbaijani leadershis, even after many years, still prefers to keep the answers behind seven locks. The story liegt many years ago.
since the waning years of the USSR, the people of the self-determined Nagorno-Karabakh have been fighting for the recognition of their status guaranteed by the international law. aku's response to the aspiration of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh to exercise their right to self-determination were pogroms and ethnic-cleansing of the Armenian population, the reaction to the implementation of that right in 1991, based on then existing USSR legislation and norms of international law was the large-scale war against the newly-independent Artsakh, accompanied by gross violations of international humanitarian law.Exactly 26 years ago Azerbaijani Armed Forces commenced the months-long shelling of the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh - Stepanakert, which at that time had become a shelter for the refugees fleeing the pogroms in Sumgait, Baku and other cities in Azerbaijan. On February 13, 1992, in violation of international conventions, Azerbaijan started using BM-21 ""Grad"" multi rocket launchers on the residential areas of Stepanakert. Khojaly was one of the seven fire bases used for the shelling of Stepanakert. Even back in Soviet time Khojaly had an important strategic importance, as it was situated on the crossroad connecting Stepanakert to other regions of Nagorno-Karabakh. Moreover, in 1970s the only airport of Nagorno-Karabakh was built next to Khojaly, which during the Artsakh's blockade was the single gateway to the outside world. Thus, by 1992 it became evident that the neutralization of Khojaly firepoint was an imperative for the physical preservation of the population of both Stepanakert and Nagorno-Karabakh as a whole. The operation to neutralize the Khojaly firepoint started on February 25, 1992.For months, the Nagorno-Karabakh self-defense forces had been informing the Azerbaijani side through all possible means about this operation, its objectives and the humanitarian corridor left for the evacuation from Khojaly.Ayaz Mutalibov, President of Azerbaijan in 1990-1992 said: ""The disappointing events happening around, you know -clashes, death of people, arouse the feeling of bitterness and sorrow, as well as suspicions that someone is certainly unsatisfied with the process. You see, I am uncertain about the goals, but nonetheless I have this feeling that there are forces which are against-the process-they want the situation to become worse, for these things to continue, because, you know, it is always convenient to take advantage of troubled waters. Many here seek these waters. Some people do not care whom to shoot at.
""According to the surviving residents of Khojaly, all of this was organized to be used as an excuse for my resignation. Some forces were struggling to discredit the President.""
""We are just tired, tired of this confrontation. Common people are dying every day, while someone is building his ambitions on it and pushing forward his political goals.Let's not forget that more than 700 residents of Khojaly did not leave the village and were taken to Stepanakert, where they were provided with food and medical aid. Two days later they were transferred to the Azerbaijani side, without any preconditions.""
The Azerbaijani leadership has not answered yet to those questions raised by Azerbaijanis themselves. Meanwhile it has almost mastered the art of distorting the above-mentioned facts in order to blame others for their crimes and escape responsibility, while attempting to create a fictional counterbalance to the massacres that it has perpetrated against Armenians in Sumgait, Baku, Kirovabad and Maragha.
So it's a huge shame to create a film on a false and lie. you should at least at the beginning state, that it is a fantasy genre and all the scenes are fictional."
" Fake!!!
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,"!!!Do not watch it! This film does not have a true base. Azerbaijan is trying to present themselves as a victim but in reality, all this organized by the military-political elite of Azerbaijan to get credit from the international organizations. It is common for Azerbaijan to harm its people and then blame Armenians for that."
" INACCURATE!!!

Horrifying!!! 300,000 Armenians were massacred during Baku and Sumgait pogroms, no Armenian is ever safe near Azeris. Artsakh is a free nation and needs to be recognized in order to stop second Armenian Genocide and leave indigenous Armenians live in peace. Azerbaijan is a dictatorship and have committed endless amount of war crimes against innocent civilians and POWs."

" Why Messed Up The Truth?
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,"It is very sad that the story is not well researched up. First, to create such a movie, the narrator should have very well knowledge of history, but seems he doesn't. The Armenians live in this land forever, since Biblical times, when Our ancestor Noy was settled here.
In 1920 Artsagh was given by Soviet Union to Azerbaijan as autonomous Republic of "" Nagorno Karabagh."" The narrator should pay attention that Azerbaijan was founded on April, 1920 as Republic of Azerbaijan. How the Azeris can claim that Artsagh belongs to Azerbaijan? After collapse of USSR, every single republic was separated and was given independence. Why that independence shouldn't given to Artsagh as well, considering that the population of Artsagh was and is generally consistent of ethnic Armenians?
Everyone can claim that this land belongs to them, but the truth is one. This land belongs to Armenians since Noy and Armenians ""occupied"" this land from Noy! Why the narrator doesn't want to show how Armenians were killed in Sumgait in 1988, why he is covering just one side?
It is very shameful that educated person can mess up such facts. Remember, the truth will win!
THE GOD SEES EVERYTHING !"

The Armenians are not involved in these events. There are materials of the Czech journalist Dana Mazalova that the Azerbaijanis massacred the Meskhitian Turks in Khojaly, and then, as always, blamed the Armenians for everything. It was a planned action (if I can call it that) of the Aliyev clan to gain power. All materials are in archives, websites and even youtube.

" Khojaly was committed by Azerbaijani opposition
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,"Ayaz Mutalibov, the first president of Azerbaijan, in his interview with ""Nezavisimaya Gazeta"" in April 1992, stated not only about the existence of a ""free corridor"", but also claimed that the massacre of civilians in Khojaly was committed by Azerbaijani opposition, so as to remove him from office.
Journalist. -What do you think about the Khojaly events, after which you resigned? The corpse of the people from Khojaly were found not far from Aghdam. Someone had shot them in the foot to prevent them from escaping. Then they were hit with axes. On February 29, my colleagues had filmed their corpses. On March 2, during the new recordings, the skulls of those corpses were removed. This is a weird game.
Mutalibov. - As the rescued Khojaly residents say, this everything was organized to create the scenario for my resignation. Some force acted to discredit the president. I highly doubt, that the Armenians showing a clear and reasonable approach to such a situation would allow the Azeris to obtain facts exposing their fascist acts. If I declare, that it was the fault of the Azerbaijani opposition, then they can say that I slander. However, the general picture is that Armenians left a corridor, through which people could leave. So why would they shoot? As soon Khojaly was surrounded by tanks it was necessary to immediately lead the civilians out. Earlier I had given similar orders regarding Shushi: to evacuate women and children and to leave only men in the city. It's one of the laws of war: people must be rescued. My conduct was objective and unambiguous: I gave such an order, but why they weren't followed in Khojaly is not clear to me."

Their first president Ayaz Mutalibov introduced to what happened, that Elchibey, who wanted to get the power by discrediting Mutalibov organized those killings and overthrew Mutalibov. Then the Aliyev clan thought of exaggerating those killings, making it into a massacre to have his people constantly hating Armenians. Why? Simple. Azerbaijan is rich with oil and gas, yet the Azerbaijani people are not impacted by the rich income their country makes. They never tasted the feeling of being a citizen of a oil and gas rich country. They have serious socio-economic problems and to divert the people's attention from the desire to overthrow the Aliyev clan, they created a monster image from Armenians. When asked, avarage Azerbaijani has never met an Armenian in real life. Well, looks like the Alive clan succeeded in their plans."

",2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,"Repeating another review. i wonder why you still has movie up? ""Khodjali events were well documented by an Azerbaijani journalist who was later killed by azeri government for speaking the truth. This journalist documented that 90% of the corpses were found on areas controlled by AZERI army and also when he went to check the area layer on he wrote that IF THERE WAS NO CORRIDOR LEFT BY ARMENIANS THE NOBODY COULD LEAVE THE TOWN Also armenians have documented facts how they are warning azeris about the attack 1 MONTH before the attack. And the toen of Khsodjali was attacked only because the Armenian civilians have been under missle attacks from that towns positions And another interesting fact to open your eyes When the AZERI journalist was at the scene of those events he saw Armenian troops passing near by on car but none of the Azeris was attacked or killed,Armenian troops never fought with civilians they always fought only with the enemy who attacked us(Just like nowadays when Armenians are defending from Turkey and Azerbaijani combined attack against PEACEFUL Artshakh known also as Nagorno Karabakh(Nagorno Karabakh is the Soviet name given to the region and aslo same Soviet government included the territory under islamic Azerbaijan control no matter the fact that in Artshakh the 97 % of population was and still is Christian Armenians) Please check the facts first before forming an opinion don't believe this fake propaganda. And the last thing Armenians saw 1915 Armenian Genocide and movies like this are nothing than a funny attempt to have something similar, Azeri ruling clan needed something like this to implement haye towards Armenians and they are doing it STARTING FROM KINDERGARTEN so just let it sink for a moment."""

",2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,"The conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis has started in 1988 not in 1992, with the massacre of Armenians in Sumgait (about which this movie is mum), in Kirovabad again (again mum) and then in Baku (again mum) where hundreds of Armenians were killed with axes and their bodies thrown off balconies in 1990. Further, in Khojaly where yes civilians have died, Azerbaijanis themselves reported that days ago they were given multiple warnings on radio by Armenian troops to leave the city but the Azerbaijani troops have ignored these and didn't let the people leave. The numbers of death and the circumstances are also heavily biased and exaggerated, which makes this one perhaps the worst historical movies I've ever seen"

",2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,"As for the artistic qualities of the movie, it is mediocre. Even the presence of Jeremy Irons, one of the best actors out there, wasn't enough to make it decent.Where this movie becomes truly problematic, is when it attempts to parade itself as an account of historical events. While the massacre in Khojhaly did indeed take place, the interpretation of these events by the authors of this movie is false and is dictated by decade-old Azerbaijani propaganda tactic, aimed at demonizing their neighbors, Armenians.For decades the official state propaganda from Baku, Azerbaijan, has been trying to shift the attention from Anti-Armenian pogroms in Sumgait and Baku that took place in the late 80s and early 90s. Azerbaijan has been denying the Anti-Armenian pogroms ever happened and has been going out of its way to put the blame for the Khojaly tragedy on the Armenians.The consensus from independent investigators is that the Khojaly massacre was perpetrated by the Aliyev clan (who are in power in the republic to this day) as a part of a coup to displace then-president Ayaz Mutalibov. As a result of this coup, a nationalist party came into power in Azerbaijan, while ex-President Mutalibov was exiled. While in exile, he gave an extensive account of what really happened in Khojaly.Another interesting source of information on this issue is Chingiz Mustafayev, an Azerbaijani reporter who investigated the events got killed in strange circumstances later in 1992. Czech reporter Dana Mazalova also has many writings and video interviews about the true nature of the Khojaly tragedy."

However, az soldiers killed them, and those who escaped were killed too later in Aghdam. Few international and az journalists having the evidence were killed too. Even Az Minister of National Securty Vagif Guseynov said that both Baku pogroms and Khojaly massacre were done by Az.

" This film is director's sick imagination!!!
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,Even the president of azerbaijan mutalibov announced that it was falsehood!!!
" The film is based on incomplete and inaccurate historic events
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,"The massacres of Khojaly are clearly a human tragedy, however the story presented in this movie differs on too many points from the facts that have been gathered, analysed and presented to the international community. The corridor in Khojaly was designed by the Armenian army to allow azeri citizens a safe passage to leave the disputed land and flee to Azerbaijan. This is not just a conspiracy made up by Armenians - it's a fact that numerous Azeri officials and representatives have admitted.
The Azerbaijani journalist Eynulla Fatullayev stated in his book ""Karabakh Diary"" and is quoted in the European Court of Human Rights Case ( Fatullayev v Azerbaijan) : ""...... for the sake of fairness I will admit that several years ago I met some refugees from Khojaly, temporarily settled in Naftalan, who openly confessed to me that, on the eve of the large-scale offensive of the Russian and Armenian troops on Khojaly, the town had been encircled by those troops. And even several days prior to the attack, the Armenians had been continuously warning the population about the planned operation through loudspeakers and suggesting that the civilians abandon the town and escape from the encirclement through a humanitarian corridor along the Kar-Kar River. According to the Khojaly refugees' own words, they had used this corridor and, indeed, the Armenian soldiers positioned behind the corridor had not opened fire on them""
Elman Mammadov, a government official and Member of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan was quoted in the Russian ""Memorial"" report: ""We knew that the corridor was designed to allow the civilian population to leave ... "".
Don't trust me, google it."
" Disgusting
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,"This is not documentry.For decades, Azerbaijan has been infusing its population with hatred and Armenophobia, the gravest expression of which can be found in this fake movie."

After the Artsakh Defense Army presented indisputable facts of the use of phosphorous munitions containing elements of chemical weapons by the enemy forces, the Azerbaijani official circles have bent to the unpromising task of spreading ludicrous and naive statements making futile efforts in their quest to come off clear."

" Endless Corridor
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,10,"Brilliant documentary about the human rights tragedy in 1992, when hundreds of Azerbaijanis were massacred after Armenians stormed the city of Khojaly."
" Genocide fabrication!!
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,"The movie is a depiction of terrible azeri propaganda for which they have failed to serve evidences. The massacreas did happen but they happened on Azeri-controlled side after Armenian military provided a corridor for the Azeri civilians to escape!
After multiple warnings, on Feb. 25, 1992 the Armenian self-defence forces attacked Khojaly to end the blockade in which they had ended up during the war. Azeri civilians tried to flee through the corridor. However, Azeri forces fired at the column, killing them in a most barbarian and cruel way (shot at their knees). Although the Armenians were successful in neutralizing the Azeri fire- power, Khojaly remained in Azeri hands for many months.
Soon after the attack, Azeri authorities claimed that Armenians had committed not only genocide by firing at the fleeing Azeris but had also mutilated the bodies of the dead. The photo evidences show that bodies were mutilated days after the people were killed (photos on the first days, and several days later). Again, Armenian military did not have access to the area where the bodies were found. This horrible massacre was organized to demonize the Armenian military.
For witness evidences check Czech lawyer and journalist Dana Mazalova."
" It's not the truth
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,"It can't be true, because people has been killed in places, which were under control of Azerbaijani army.

",2020-10-31 00:00:00,10,Unimaginable actions against humanity. Khojaly massacre is a wound for those who had to experience it. Those who signed for the terror of civilians yet never been sentenced or punished.
" Film really based on true story
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,10,Film based on a true story. It shows what happend in Karabakh in 1992. How Azerbaijan lost Karabakh. It shows victimes of Azerbaijan as a result Armenian agression
" True information
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,10,"The Nagorno-Karabakh region and seven adjacent districts of Azerbaijan were invaded and occupied by Armenia in the early 1990s. As a result, 800,000 Azerbaijanis were expelled from their ancestral lands and homes, and remain internally displaced after almost 30 years. Armenia committed ethnic cleansing against the Azerbaijani population in the occupied territories. All these IDPs await the day to return to their homes and lands.
Four UN Security Council resolutions (822, 853, 874, and 884) adopted in 1993 demand immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of the Armenian forces from Azerbaijan's occupied territories. Unfortunately, Armenia continues to ignore these resolutions. Azerbaijan's lands have been occupied for 30 years now.
Millions of people of Azerbaijani origin were left without their homes after the ethnic cleansing conducted by Armenians. They don't recognize today's position of the world about the territory and make historical claims, but if you take a look at the history (objective) you will see that it was the policy of the Russian empire through the years to relocate Armenian people from other territories to Nagorno-Karabakh to strengthen its positions in the region, because its policy always was divide and conquer! And now they say we should rule the land where we are the majority. With the same logic, you can easily create hundreds of new countries around the world.
While I am writing this post Armenia is conducting missile attacks against Azerbaijani civilians and civilian infrastructure in the major cities:"
" It's a real story. It broke my heart.. Excellent reflection of Armenian genocide
