" Wrong Title.
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,1,"They should have called this movie ""A Most Boring Movie"". I felt like I was reading a book. No violence whatsoever. Should be rated G for garbage."
" What violence
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,2,"Possibly the slowest most drawn out movie I have ever seen. I kept waiting for something to happen , snore fest"
" If Only...
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,6,"I did enjoy this film, it has a pretty good atmosphere, it teases where it might take us and the characters of the story are some of the best I have watched in a movie for quite a while.Unfortunately for both me and the movie about a third of the way through it I thought 'how good would this movie have been if Scorsese did it?' There were a couple of reasons for this.Whilst they did an ok job of setting the scene of the early 80's I think Scorsese is the master of this and would have created a more immersive vision of the era.Secondly an injection of violence to up the ante of the drama already created. It didn't need to go down the path of Goodfellas but using a few elements of that movie in AMVY would have enhanced the film.Still...good movie."
" Simply a Masterpiece
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,9,"I never thought it will end up so deep. From the beginning to very last scene - it is enjoyable. The story of a hard fought, honest & integrated businessman is truly inspiring. If you are a fan of decent thriller with blends of drama, this is must watch!PS: Oscar does an excellent job, became his fan."
" A beautifully cinematography put together.
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,7,"At the time i was watching a got distracted a couple times, but this movie speaks for the title of this review. It was my first time watching Oscar Issac, i still think i need to watch a couple more movies to understand his acting, but it was a good performance nontheless.The story is pretty straight foward, nothing to crazy, easy to understand with just a few action scenes, or scenes with more attention, whatever you wanna call.Cinematography wise, it's beautiful in my opinion."
" Worthy a watch
",2020-11-13 00:00:00,7,"This movie has all the makings and cast to be a great movie. The movie isn't bad, it just moves kind of slow. Good movie overall."
" Nothing special at all
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,5,"Boring, no where going story. You expect something to happen but it stays at teasing. Pointles movie to be honest."
" Well made and well acted, just not very engaging.
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,6,"This movie is basically The Godfather part II but without the flashbacks and not nearly as good.It just doesn't feel like it has enough conflict.
There is conflict, but it just doesn't feel like it.However, there are some really good moments in it that make it worth watching. The score is amazing."
" Pacino with no Balls
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,1,Armed thug tries to break into his house. Wife gets a gun for protection. He takes it away from her saying that he won't have gun in his house.Armed thugs try to rob his employee who defends himself with a gun. Employee then kills himself because police want to arrest him for having gun.Ridiculous movie.
" Complex Characters
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,9,"I'm surprised by the reaction most people have regarding the character of Abel Morales. Most people describe him as doing his best to run a legitimate business and lead an ethical life, and while there's some measure of truth to that, the film also demonstrates that his attitude is self-serving and self righteous - just as much hypocritical goody two shoes as the real thing. He is being investigated for illegal business activities, but tries to come off as being unjustly harassed by the District Attorney's office, even though the film leaves little doubt that the charges are at least partially true. Much worse, his drivers are frequently hi-jacked and fearful for their lives, but Abel cares little about helping them; he's basically just concerned about how it affects his business. After one of his drivers is badly beaten during one of the hijackings, he recovers, but returns to the job with a gun (which Abel is opposed to), and much as Abel fears, he panics and gets involved in a shootout with approaching would-be hijackers. But Abel has no empathy for the driver, just himself and his business. Near the end, when the driver, Julian, reappears, Abel makes it abundantly clear what he himself really cares about."
" Good, But Never Quite Elevated To The Heights It Could Reach
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,7,"An excellent cast can't quite take this up to the league it aspires to; for a mob movie, it's more on the intimate rather than epic end of the genre. It tells the story of a couple who seem to be in over their heads in trying to establish themselves in a New York that's experiencing it's most violent year on record and that's in the grip of mob interests. The problem is that the film can't quite decide which side of the story to give most airtime to - the mob business or the story of a couple under pressure, struggling to prove themselves and stay alive. The latter seems more interesting to me - the superb Jessica Chastain seems more decisive and competent than her onscreen husband who can probably sense that truth at an instinctive level, hence not allowing her to step into the leadership role she could and should be in. Only once in the film (when a dying animal is put out of its misery) does she take the bull by the horns, and then it's a shock to him - one which angers him. But this story is given less room to breathe, pulsing below the surface, pulsing below the surface and occasionally being allowed up for air. It's gripping, and the film ends on an intriguing note - but there's the sense that we could and should have had more of the dynamics of the couple at the heart of this film that would have elevated the film to greater heights."
" Very good...
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,8,"Very good ... The dose of tension, conflicts of interest, the most violent year seemed even calm in the face of everything we are going through, in Brazil and in the world, not only with regard to violence, but also the pandemic and troubled moments ... Excellent film , irregular and sometimes slow, but lovely ... A predictable but satisfactory outcome ..."
" So what??????
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,6,"It's a movie that has no reason of existence,no purpose...It starts interestingly and leaves the impression that something big is going to happen,something that will change things dramatically...But nothing happens...The only worth mentioning thing in the movie is the funny reseblance between Chastain&Isaac and De Niro&Stone in the Casino movie...Other than that it's just a movie that has no meaning"
" Not ""Godfather""
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,7,"I registered to leave a review for this movie. It's not ""Godfather""! Not even close. The movie is ok to watch. The title is not relevant. I would say just violent, not a most violent. Jessica Chastain is fabulous. 7/10 for me."
" A solid period piece...
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,6,"A solid period piece by the writer/director J.C. Chandor with Oscar Isaac as the lead. Visually stunning storytelling, but lacks a bit tension in dialogue."
" Anti climax
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,3,"The good
The acting is top notch.
The orange and teal grade looks fantastic.
Photography is excellent.The bad
Fails to deliver the tension or climax it threatened to early on.
As the credits rolled I was left with a ""was that it?"" Feeling somewhat cheated."
" Nothing new to see
",2019-12-24 00:00:00,6,"Its a reasonable film but there was not an awful lot that was original about it. It seemed like it could have just as easily been an elongated episode of NYPD blue or the like.Decent performance in the lead role and it seemed the main question in the film was about his morals - for me, that still remains unanswered as the source of the criminal investigations were a little hazy as were the political connotations at the end."
" A little boring
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,6,It's like Godfather but with trucks instead of anything of interest.
" Soooooo good.
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,9,"This is one of my favorite movies. It's good because it's a movie that you can easily picture a prequel and a sequel. Oscar was incredible, one of his best performances. I had never seen a movie with Jessica Chastain untill this movie and she was fantastic. Great story, great acting."
" Compelling
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,10,"I missed this first time around, saw it late on bbc2 recently and recorded. What a great movie this is, one of best ive seen all year. A man struggling with his conscience to protect his family , survive and grow his business in a gritty New York City. Brilliant."
" A most 'Silent' non violent year!
",2019-09-07 00:00:00,3,"I so wanted this film to be great. I imagined gangsters, yes, there are some. Not gangsters like in 'The Godfather', no, gangsters like a four year old would write about after innocent school yard squabbles. I'd watch any film with Jessica Chastain in, (hence the three stars) but this film is so slow, so boring, and so nonviolent, that I was looking on ways to sue the makers for misleading me with the title.
I'm sorry, but this film is a waste of two hours, so give it a miss."
" A Most Forgettable and Overrated Film
",2019-07-06 00:00:00,4,"The premise of a young up and coming man with ambition making it in the fuel industry with his beautiful wife and two (2) children after just moving into their dream home and in a tony neighborhood is turned upside down rather quickly in the cut throat business he has chosen.I always enjoy the retro scenery of the past decades (the 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's and even the 80's) and A Most Violent Year did a good job in maintaining the scenery of that 80's era, especially with the vehicles. What I didn't enjoy though was the storyline and the over played ethnic roles of the players in the fuel industry.The story was slow and yet predicable, lacking any level of suspense and/or characters that you could either love or hate. No memorable performances to speak of either.I give this film a paltry 4 out of 10 rating."
" A Great Period Piece About 1980's Corruption In New York City.
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,6,"Maybe it's because I am living in the 2nd golden era of television, but this film feels like it should have been a television series. It's a fine film, with a great tone and good camera work. Many of the small scenes and subplots could have been expanded on - like the young and insecure salesman that gets beat up on his first sales call, or the past and hidden activities of the wife. So much is happening in this quiet 90 minute film, that we have to assume a lot. In an era where everything seems to be made into a 10 episode show, this movie left a lot on the cutting room floor.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,4,"Kinda boring with a meh story. good acting especially by the main character. good dialogue. I didn't have a problem with anything specific, it was just boring and not special (1 viewing)"
" Good move
",2019-06-07 00:00:00,6,"I find it worthwhile to see this film, and it's one of the great films I've seen"
" Supercool
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,8,"I give 8 stars for this - that by the current Imdb standards counts as a 10. It's the second movie I watched by Chandor, and the second hit (the other being Margin Call). Chandor has a killer istinct for clichés, he takes one and then works it from the inside making a piece of art out of it. He goes for the core reality of those tropes (actual or perceived) and then slaps it in your face with intense, essential dialogues, real-life language, straight situations, and deep characters. This was very apparent in A Most Violent Year, because right from the start it follows this double pattern: a super-idealized setting from 1981, and a modernized storytelling. Cinematography was outstanding, with beautiful yellows, washed-out colors and disturbingly dim lighting for the interiors - just like many movie from the eighties. The soundtrack was on par, with a simple, monotone and saddening theme, straight from the eighties as well. Casting Oscar Isaac was a stroke of genius, cause he's a dead ringer for Erik Estrada.
Now about the story itself, I would say that it's surprising and weird, though being very earthbound at the same time. It's someway... reverse-surprising, but I won't spoiler anything about it."
" Extreme attention to detail
",2019-04-05 00:00:00,8,"I always notice when the little things are off in movies the effectiveness of which hinges on authenticity. Everything in A Most Violent Year is true to the time period...the cars, the jacket lapels, the appliances, and even the razor that Abel is seen using in one scene (safety razor, not a bic).Message of the movie: a deep, heartfelt ode to materialism and the love of money. Everyone is corrupt. Recreates perfectly the attitude of 1980s NYC-that the pursuit of wealth is of the utmost intrinsic goodness, that placing the pursuit of selfish goals above all else is the most righteous path."
" Great Film
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,10,I really enjoyed the film. Great acting and story line.
" Not as far-out from other thrillers, but worth the watch
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,7,"A Most Violent Year got my attention for all the buzz of it being the needle in the haystack among crime thrillers. Not only that but also the cast and the footage I've seen (featuring gorgeus cinematography from Bradford Young) were major components to make me watch this.Now that I've seen it, I must say I am a little disappointed. Which is unfortunate beacause it is a good film, but my expectations were too high.The dialogue often felt too artificial for a movie aiming towards a more realistic and somber tone, and it could also benefit from a slower editing pace between scenes, focusing more on mundane situations that underline the movie's themes rather than just dialogue to dialogue.
And that's assuming the film was heading towards conveying a bigger message, beacuse if the opposite was the case - in which there was no intention to display concern a certain matter or theme but rather tell a specific story about the oil business in that given year, the movie also didn't get there.It almost feels like the tone was very clear in the director's head, but it was forced into a cluster of scenes with no thematic context nor bigger cohesion (remember that making a movie without a ""bigger picture"" is still a decision regarding the thematic context, it never ceases to exist).On the other hand, the action sequences are handled very well by fitting the tone of the movie, that being of a smaller caliber but not lessening the tension. And that's one point where the editing does its job perfectly, just look at the chase sequence that involves Abel.The acting is superb, although the script could have explored other aspects on Jessica Chastain's character, like her constant struggle to face fear and uncertainty through decisions that go against what her husband believes, representing the oil industry's tendencies to illegal activities in contrast to Abel's strive to go the clean way, and how that relation works inside a marriage.Again, a well structured tone inside a movie that doesn't know exactly where it goes. But it's worth your time for bein a lesson on crafting economic and suspenseful action scenes, and also an interesting insight into the struggles of an righteous entrepeneur soaked into a world that does everything to corrupt him."
" Mediocre story.
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,6,"Politics got in the way of a possible good story.
Acting way good. Filming was good. But just came up short."
" A flat movie
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,2,"Beautifully shoot. Good looking clothes. Main character lacks depth, supposed to want to be honest but comes across as uncaring sociopat.Slow movie."
" Anti-gun comedy
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,2,"Since no one else has said it, in a nutshell, the film is a anti-gun propaganda film thinly veiled behind a mildly interesting plot.
You can still love or hate the movie.
It's not an especially exciting ""thriller.""
Definitely not in the same universe as Godfather, Casino, Heat, Brasco, etc.I only say it's a comedy on the basis of how utterly transparent Hollywood is about their biases and how (evidently little they understand gun law, self defense philosophies, and justified use of force."
" Unpopular opinion, I didn't like this movie.
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,4,"There is no plot, it goes so slow that you wonder why you even watched this movie. And some scenes are so dark that you can't even see the scene in front of you. I don't understand how this movie was given a green light. It's someones idea of what ethics should be, but it does nothing to keep the audience in the loop. Only good thing is the main actors."
" ""I've always been a lot more afraid of failure than of anything else.""
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,8,"It was kind of difficult relating to the character of Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac), he was getting ripped off left and right but didn't want to retaliate in a manner that would have matched his enemies. His wife Anna (Jessica Chastain) grew up in a family that handled things directly with force, and that caused some friction between the married couple. Even though Abel maintained a stoic resolve throughout the story to maintain a semblance of integrity, you couldn't help but feel that there was some undercurrent of corruption in his own business, but you would never know it by his actions. But you got a sense of it when the Feds came calling and there was a mad dash to hide the company's business records. Other than Anna's confession that she was skimming the books ever since she began handling the financial end, there was nothing outwardly crooked about the way the business was being run.I had a bad feeling about that one million dollar down payment to the Hasidics in a deal that could have gone horribly wrong and almost did. Relative to the other million and a half Abel had to come up with, it was intriguing how a couple of his competitors like old Saul (David Margulies) and Peter Forente (Alessandro Nivola) came through to give him a hand. It felt like an 'honor among thieves' commitment to keep one of their own going. But it was funny to me when Abel confronted all the oil men at the meeting, and just like Obama telling Putin to 'cut it out' over Russian hacking, he told the assembled group to knock off the business with the truck hijackings. Like any of them were about to listen unless some kind of heat was turned up on the bunch.So all the while as Abel's trucks kept getting picked off, his driver Julian (Elyes Gabel) sought for a shootout on the Brooklyn Bridge, and the desperate time frame to come up with cash he needed, I was quite literally waiting for that Straw Dogs moment when he would go berserk and just start taking out anyone who got in his way. It was somewhat frustrating actually, to see him biding his time and working things out in his own way. I guess I've been conditioned by too many 'real' gangster flicks to accept the idea that Abel would have been as passive as he was.The topper on all this though comes at the very end when the District Attorney (David Oyelowo) investigating Abel showed up at the newly purchased waterfront property and more than casually hinted that he was open for business himself in terms of future backing for his political ambitions. That was pretty much an affirmation that Abel was going to have to go along to get along with the seamy side of the business in order to grow and prosper. As for the picture's title, inquiring minds like to know, so I looked it up. 1981 indeed was New York City's most violent year if measured by it's one hundred twenty thousand reported robberies, an all time record. Though murders were slightly down from the prior year, it did seem unlikely back then that the city would ever reverse it's steadily increasing crime rate,"
" A good crime film
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,7,"Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain portray Abel and Anna Morales, a couple who own and run a heating oil company in 1981 in New York City. Abel tries his best to run his business as cleanly as possible in a corrupt industry. One of their frequent problems is having their oil trucks hijacked, sometimes violently thus putting their truck drivers in danger.Director/writer J.C. Chandor uses a lot bleak and dark lighting throughout the film which helps to keep the viewer distant from the characters. While less distance might have created a more fulfilling experience, there is at least a consistency that can be commended.Also commendable is a story with various plot lines but always understandable, a rarity in many modern crime films. While the film is seen through the eyes of Abel, it includes the view of a working-class employee whose plight is almost dismissed as trivial to the the wealthy couple.Isaac and Chastain do a fine job in their roles. As the head of a wealthy family empire, it's fascinating how much Isaac resembles Al Pacino (aka Michael Corleone of ""The Godfather"" films) at the same age.While ""A Most Violent Year"" doesn't meet the higher standards of other crime classics, it is still quite entertaining."
" Drag
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,4,"Actors doing great job, camera work is also great and it is very atmospheric and gives it 80's feeling but it is too long and nothing violent happens. I do not recommend."
" An incredibly long, dull year.
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,1,"It's only an 2 hours long, but it sure seemed like a year!"
" Wake me up when it's over
",2018-09-22 00:00:00,1,"We heavily rely on user reviews when deciding what to watch our Friday night movie and since you might, too, I had to warn you about this movie that has a 7.0 user rating. It has the FEEL of ""The Godfather', the main character being this quiet, good-looking, brooding 'nice guy"" type but that is as far as this thing got. The storyline is about the cut throat gas business in 1980's NYC, somewhat of an eye opener, because really, who knew? It's a slow burn, just interesting enough to make you keep watching because you're thinking SOMETHING is going to happen, it has to, right? Apparently not. Because nothing.ever.happens. Nothing. Oh yeah, there was that one chase scene. That culminated in nothing.happening. Save yourself, there's still time! Save Friday movie night!!"
" A Most Misleading Title !!
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,5,"It may have a been a very violent year in reality , but the Producer of this movie clearly decided not to reveal much of it .
Boring - just meanders from one talking scene to the next , then just when you think something explosive it about to happen ...fsssttt nothing!
It was only that (unrealized) expectation that something must happen that kept me going until the end .
Not recommended"
" Slow but Stylish Noir
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,6,"The main actor was magnetic. Imagine a cool, stylish, calm, Italian, New York gangster, who is neither a gangster, nor Italian, but seems mildly like both. I've never heard of this guy, but he either pulled it off really well, or he is like that in real life.
In the film he is an Hispanic business owner who must walk the tightrope of ethics in order to compete, but also married a gangster's daughter. But he himself is a decent man who is passionate about limiting unethical or immoral behavior. In that sense a rather refreshing character for a modern movie. 
But then it doesn't take place in the modern era. It's in the early 80's. Through use of subtle techniques, not bombardment, we do get a feeling for the time period. Something about the quality of the film stock and the cars, hairstyles, and clothes helps. But there is no obnoxious soundtrack.
 The man deals in heating oil, but there isn't an explanation for what that means. Those of us from other parts of the country or other eras don't necessarily understand who uses this, and for what specifically
Meanwhile it would have been nice to hear a bit more about his background, how he acquired this business, how he developed his philosophy, and why he married this woman. Presumably because she is tougher than him. But did her dad set him up with the business? Well the ethics of the city oil business is not a sexy subject, but the actor's film noir mannerisms, including his tempered desperation give it an edge that keeps you tuned in."
" Don't trust high ratings
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,1,"Man this movie was boring from start to finish. Acting seemed decent but crap this thing was slower than sling blade eating taters... I really cant figure out why this movie was even made. It has no redeeming qualities and its very forgettable. Matter of fact I already forgot 90% of the movie and I just finished watching it. So many better choices than this. Im guessing all the high reviews came from fans that
Love the actors no matter what kind of movie they make. It must be that cause this movie was lame..."
" A Really Good Movie With A Well Done Storyline But Softpedals The Oil Industry Reality
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,9,"07/09/2018 The storyline tells of a few facets of corruption within the fuel delivery/small oil company industry, mainly the small jobber home heat and fuel delivery. I too was in that industry from 1980 to 1985 in Southern New Jersey. The corruption given in this movie is mild, almost non existent by comparisson to the reality of the real oil business which includes, corrupt politics, under the table state contracts, organized crime involvement along and so on and so on, just to skim the criminal surface. Top to bottom, from major oil companies (the biggest/price at the pump fixers/collusion) down to a small business with maybe a few trucks on the road - a pure web of corruption! A good movie that only touches on the problems within the industry."
" The Righteous Man:there is a thin line between justice and violence
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,9,"I really am a bit lost for words to describe how magnificent this movie is, because IMAGES are what makes this classic burn through my heart. Words are failing when images are so powerful as in ""A Most Violent Year""... Seen it 5 times already since it's release and it is here to stay. Gets better with every viewing...It is not a big drama or thriller, it is the story of the struggle to build up an business empire, depicting the thin line between achieving succes and becoming complicit in violence. Oscar Isaac plays an upcoming oil distributor in New York back in the eighties, at a time when crime was running wild in the big apple. Married to a mob's daugther he still wants to walk the righteous path without using his wife's mob connections to make a succes of his oilbusiness. Will he succeed in being a honest businessman or will he cave in under pressure and use the mob to build up his new oil company?This movie became a classic at the very moment it was released. You just gotta see it to believe it. It is not the story that is monumental, the acting is though. The very best of Oscar Isaac, Jessica Chastain and Albert Brooks. The way this tale of succes and deceit is photographed and scored deserves nothing but praise. Eye and ear candy! The direction by J.C. Chandor builds up a tension that absorbs every second of film. Few directors are capable of creating such delicate, intense, contineous suspense. J.C Chandor's masterpiece."
" Waste of Chastain's talent, pointless film
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,4,"Frankly, I do not understand how any producer could finance such a pointless film, or how a director could do so little to improve what must have been a poor script to start off with. For one thing, the single most magnetic performer, Chastain, disappears from the film for long spells, and apart from unhesitatingly shooting dead a wounded deer, she makes no significant contribution in terms of character or deeds, and unexpectedly as well as needlessly, uses bad language with a cop, which is not a wise thing to do, especially if that cop produces a warrant to search your house.The most baffling thing of all is, however, the constant attention given to Oscar Isaac, a very limited actor who plays a kind of latter day Hamlet unable to take action against whoever keeps attacking his trucks and stealing his fuel, until he has no option but resort to his own bit of violence. He is obviously a good looking man, or he would not have been the lead to the stunningly beautiful Chastain, but his acting lets him down, and he is not helped by his unremittingly pure character, which is hardly credible under the circumstances. Ultimately, I found his character exhasperating. And then there is the totally pointless re-appearance of one of his drivers who had been the target of attacks, and been absent from the film for a considerable while after apparently succeeding in eluding police, only to blow his own brains out when he could have whacked Isaac. As if that idiocy were not bad enough, in the process he puts a hole through one of Isaac's fuel tanks, and the latter duly tried to block the leak with a useless piece of cloth.Hmmm...Soundtrack, direction, photography all mediocre. Definitely a film I will not watch again."
" A Hollywood Movie That Focuses On An Honest Businessman!
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,8,"To me at least, this engrossing film is much more about an independent businessman facing huge hurdles in a (very) tough industry, than it is the crime drama that critics allude to. Indeed, its (mistitled) title, based on other reviews on this site, apparently attracted some violence-aficionados who were expecting a mob film with wise guys decapitating each other, and were thus sorely disappointed. I can't remember many (any?) Hollywood films where the central character is a businessman who is portrayed as honest, decent, wise, and with an intuitive knowledge of human nature, and that frankly makes the film interesting to me. Abel Morales (as portrayed by Oscar Isaac) is the businessman in the film. He's a well-spoken, self-controlled immigrant businessman who's doing reasonably well in the NYC heating oil business, but in the film he plans a major expansion of his capacity by purchasing a fuel oil terminal on the East River. He has 30 days to secure the financing for the acquisition but he's beset by either rivals or freelancers who hijack his fuel trucks and sell his oil, plus an ambitious Assistant DA who's investigating price-rigging and tax evasion in the heating oil business who seems to be (unfairly) targeting Morales. One thing leads to another, allowing his bank to drop his financing, and he's forced to locate other sources of funding in the few days he has left to close the deal. Maybe these business issues don't do anything for you, but the characterization of Morales and his desire to do the right thing made me root for him. His wife, the daughter of a mobster, urges him to fight violence with violence to which he refuses. He even throws her gun away that she purchased for protection. Yes, there's criminal activity in this film (e.g., the hijackings) but it's essentially about an honest man trying to stay on the right side of the law operating in a cut-throat business who has a major investment that will either make him or break him. Eight stars for a rare portrayal of a businessmen struggling to overcome all sorts of obstacles."
" A wee bit slow, but worth the wait
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,8,"Chandor has a gift: the tension simmers, the conflict builds and the characters face human conflicts. It doesn't matter whether it is Wall Street corruption, shipwrecks or family business, every movie feels high stakes. The story telling is tight, and the imagery is tighter. Performances like Isaac's here are rare, but the ability to harness them is rare too. This film is MacBeth set in 1981 New York. I wanted it to boil faster, but it cooked anyway. And the final shots were perfect."
" A most exhaustingly boring film
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,3,"This certain cure for insomnia plays as an adaptation of scenes scraped off the cutting room floors of Godfather and Goodfellas, plus one or two from The Wolf of Wall Street. The monotony is occasionally broken up by the film's only saving grace - the chemistry between Isaac and Chastain, who shine in their scenes together. Unfortunately, they are too few and far between, and this insipid drama shows just how little it has to say about any of the themes it touches on but makes no effort to try and explore. The lack of pace, action and plot development in the screenplay make A Most Violent Year, a most exhaustingly boring film."
" Original Gangster
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,9,"A Most Violent Year is a gangster movie in which the protagonist is ironically trying not to be a gangster. Oscar Isaac played the lead part so well, and it's rare to identify with a character so much that you genuinely empathize with him. I thought the movie was based on a true story, but the only factual thing about it was that New York City had its highest crime rate in 1981. Another commendable film from the director of Margin Call."
" Do the Most Right Thing
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,7,"In a movie that might have been called ""Do the Most Right Thing,"" Oscar Isaac plays yet another ethically challenged protagonist. Abel Morales is not as cranky as Llewyn Davis or as politically savvy as Nick Wasicsko, the beleaguered Yonkers mayor of the 2015 HBO series Show Me a Hero, but he's another little guy who deserves better than the forces opposed to him will allow. He's no moral paragon: He couldn't have built a successful heating oil company in New York City without bending a few of the rules -- and without the help of his less-scrupulous wife, Anna (Jessica Chastain). It's 1981, and Morales is on the brink of a big deal, purchasing property on the East River that will enable him to eliminate some of the middlemen in the business. But then everything starts going awry: His trucks are being hijacked and the district attorney (David Oyelowo) has decided to make him a target in his exposé of corrupt practices in the heating oil business. It's a gritty urban tale, the kind that the movies haven't seen much of lately, demanding an audience that doesn't demand a lot of glamour and knows how to wait patiently for things to unfold. J.C. Chandor, who wrote the screenplay, resists the temptation to reveal too much too swiftly, building a quiet tension as we begin to bring the story into focus. He also handles action well, as the title suggests, although much of the violence is latent. Best of all, he showcases some fine performances, not only from Isaac and Chastain and Oyelowo, but also from Albert Brooks as Morales's attorney, Elyes Gabel as one of the victimized truck drivers, and Alessandro Nivola as one of Morales's mobbed-up competitors. There are moments when the script's depiction of Morales's determination to go as straight as possible seems a little too much like forcing him into the good-guy role, and the climax is too melodramatic, but on the whole it's a solid movie.

" 'A Most Violent Year'...what a misleading movie title!!!
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,3,"The title alone instantly makes one think this movie is going to be thrilling. Throw in Oscar Issac, Jessica Chastain and David Oyelowo and it kicks your anticipation into high gear. That's why when the credits are rolling you feel incredibly duped and want the last two hours and five minutes of your life back!The premise? Abel Morales (Issac) is the owner of an up-and-coming heating oil company in NYC 1991, which has recently suffered the hijacking of several trucks. One driver, Julian (Elyes Gabel) is severely beaten by one of the hijackers. Abel's wife, Anna (Chastain) implores him to fight violence with violence, but he refuses. The head of the local Teamsters tells him to arm his driver's with guns for protection, but he again refuses. In addition, Abel is seeking to expand his business by purchasing a fuel oil terminal on the East River but is having a problem obtaining financing for the $1.5M deal. And somewhere in this convoluted mess is Assistant District Attorney Lawrence (Oyelowo) who is going after the entire local heating oil business for price fixing, tax evasion, etc. If my summation was disjointed, I completely agree ~ as disjointed as this movie was. Aside from Julian having a shootout in the middle of the Queensboro Bridge in the middle of the day (no...really), and Abel punching a hijacker he caught up to after a foot chase, that was about as violent as 'A Most Violent Year' ever got. Gave the movie a generous 3* out of 10...probably because I felt sorry that these great actors were wasted on this 2014 stinker."
" Jessica & Oscar with a good script and directing by J.C.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"Oscar Isaac in his prime here, fresh off leading role in Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) and before his sci-fi year with Ex Machina (2015) and Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015), delivers deadpan and conviction as a medium-size business owner faced with financial, fiscal, legal and physical trouble. He stars opposite Jessica Chastain, Oscar-nominated for The Help (2011) and Zero Dark Thirty (2012) who plays his wife which turns out to be the most complex and interesting character. Jessica had ""A Most Stellar Year"" with Interstellar (2014) and her riveting performance here. She did carry her lesser role in The Martian (2015) the next year, proving to be the sci-fi year for her as well.Isaac is a force as Abel Morales and the writing and directing builds characters and tension to a boiling denouement. He has good scenes with his wife, lawyer, employees, friends, competitors and law enforcement. He even acts a crucial scene in his native Spanish. However a deleted scene where his character scolds his oldest daughter off the road is perhaps even better than all the scenes actually left in the final cut. Make sure to look for it in the DVD/Blu-Ray.Jessica plays the tough Anna Morales and the script could have windows for her to overact, but she is mostly able to nuance her performance and keep it believable and engrossing. Her scenes with her husband are the best, but she manages to protect his and their interests in others.J.C. Chandor who was nominated for Best Writing, Original Screenplay for Margin Call (2011) writes a compelling story with some strong dialogue. He directs his two leads and creates a mood of suspense and thrill as we feel for the characters their bonds, their struggles and their fate.A stunning crime drama that creeps on you and leaves you wanting more with a succulent last act. A lot of superb details in the script and a near flawless execution. Just shy of Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright power couple as the Underwoods in House of Cards (2013)."
" A most perfect businessman
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,7,"Viewers who watched J.C. Chandor's thoughtful 'Margin Call', about the 2008 financial crisis, will see some of the same strengths in 'A Most Violent Year', whose subject is the efforts of a businessman to stay afloat in the winter of 1981. But the setup here is not entirely satisfactory: the hero is good looking, has made enough money to be able to take ""I like to own what I use"" as a guiding principle, is the last honest man in New York, and even briefly turns action hero to track down those who are stealing from him. Even the basic premise of the plot is a little contrived: to win a deal, he offers terms which leave him exposed to all of the risk (and needless to say, some of that risk duly materialises). The film hints at the possibility that he might not be as straight as he professes (or even believes); but ultimately, shies away from this position. Instead, the film asks us to respect a man whose goal is to drive his rivals out of business, because he plans to do so through his own innate excellence. We do see hints of his single-mindedness that are unappealing; but the film refrains from passing harsh judgement. The perfection of the character somewhat undermined my interest in what is basically a very well-constructed film."
