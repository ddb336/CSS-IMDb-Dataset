" Rarely I give 10s
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,10,"It's been 20 years since my home town paper published this story. This film is just so very important for seekers of truth of a new generation and generations to come be aware of this film. Before it's was so obvious which political party the paper supported, a group of journalists did the dirt, along with lawyers who never gave up, to break this story. It can't be understated how big this is and how it was swept under the rug. I love outside of Boston. My father never allowed us to associate with any church. Why? Cause he said they were all diddlers. This is like 89. So everyone knew, but it seemed so fruitless to do anything, it went on and on. I'm just proud of these guys and that lawyer man. Boston lawyers are the best. They dont...do not give up when there is a miscarriage of justice. Watch this film. The cast is amazing. Stanley Tucci... he's the man. The hulk.. BTman... Sabertooth, all do great jobs lol. It's worth every penny, every hour....."
" An amazing film.
",2021-03-25 00:00:00,10,"Not a film I might have had much hope for, believing it could have been presented more as a soap than a history, but with a fine cast, screenplay, and direction this effort ranks, in my view, as one of best ever."
" One of the best films I've ever seen
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,10,"I finally watched this on Netflix yesterday and, while I'm not going to write a long review, because others have done a great job already, I have to say that this is one of the best films I've ever seen. I sympathized with the victims, with the journalists, even the TV lawyer who did dozens of settlements. I cried when the victims recounted the stories of their abuse. I exalted when Mike Rezendes (played by Ruffalo) finally got what he was after. I could feel the emotion of Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams) as she took notes from the victim she interviewed. I could say other great things about Michael Keaton, Liev Schreiber, and Stanley Tucci. It's just an amazing ensemble cast with truly flawless acting performances. It really is tough to watch in parts, but this story is an amazing tribute to the important of investigative journalism.Thank you for making this film."
" Truly Momentous
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,9,"I can confirm (to whoever is reading this) that this will be my last review, with lockdown being eased and normality returning, there is no sense of isolation or necessity to kill time usually spend in boredom. I have chosen for my final write, rather than providing a long-winded, detailed plot summary, I reflect on the basis of the film and the message it is conveying along with inferences and techniques making the film so worth watching. Once again Mark Ruffalo reminds us his versatility and quality of acting - starring as the protagonist in the fast-paced, tense 'Spotlight'. Almost as if the tension of the film is built up as time advances the atmosphere is tangible, explaining horrid truths kept as secrets for many years, only to be exploited by a wise group of journalists. Ultimately, the film centres around the abuse and sexual harassment caused by priests in not only Boston, but all around the globe. With statistics manifesting their investigation, Rachel McAdams and Ruffalo visit victims for questioning in a bid to have the priests arrested for their actions. The alleged assaults by priests in the area seem surprising that information is only slowly unfolding 15 years on, but it is the thought of a young, religious child saying no not to a priest, but to God and turning down their religious beliefs as a form of manipulation by the so-called 'fathers'. Hard work, commitment and dedication are presented on screen and the investigation proves to be influential, sparking confidence in others to speak out about mistreatment from priests, all around the globe. An inspiring true tale that changed lives for the better. The Oscar winner encapsulating emotion and frustration, personifying the verb 'help'. 10/10 cinematography and terrific acting sees 'Spotlight' exceed all expectations."
" Should be seen by everyone
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,8,"Based on a true story, Spotlight is a very powerful movie with a brilliant casting (Mark Ruffalo's performance is great). Director Tom McCarthy goes straight to the point, it feels like we are watching a documentary, following a small team of investigate reporters who try to uncover the scandal of abuse of children in catholic church. On the same subject, I have just watched the excellent docuseries The Keepers that really moved me."
" Good but could be better!
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,7,"The movie no doubt conveyed the truth and revealed many facts. But here why I could gave it a bit low rate, first, the director used simple and straightforward motion way. No shot or any clip amassed me and led me wonder about the director or the camera. Second, I haven't been interested along with movie whilst I was watching! No suspense and eagerness. Third, I haven't been interested and sticking with any character! They all seemed same to me. I was just phlegmatic with them all.... I was just thinking and interested about the story itself nothing else."
" Watch with whole family
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,9,"Magnificent film covering an important topic. Critical that kids see it to learn how dangerous powerful institutions can be be, and why speaking up is important.
A must watch!"
" It's aight.
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,8,"I wish the direction was a bit stronger. The story itself is interesting, but I just wasn't super invested in it. The cast is really good though. There's a few scenes that bring this up to a 4 star for me. I'll probably forget about it though."
" Poor film, high ratings because it engages in a moral subject
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,4,"Very poorly executed. There was no suspension at all, no surprises, twists or any form of revelations. You knew everything from the start so there was no feeling of investigation or anything really.If this was not about a moral subject, it would had a 6.2 on imdb, not 8"
" Spotted
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,8,"After watching The Two Popes recently and now this, I'm starting to think Catholic Child Abuse should be the subject of more movies. Spotlight goes at it from a completely different direction and it absolutely works for it. Whereas The Two Popes is almost exclusively just the two stellar actors going back and forth, Spotlight is all about the ensemble. This has such a great cast, each of them delivering solid performances and really driving the plot in their own ways. It's so well balanced in fact that I struggle to think who I would consider the ""Lead"" to be. Ruffalo jumps to mind but Keaton is absolutely captivating, McAdams is always great... There's just so much talent here!The story is told well. Unfortunately it's a story we all know too well at this point but that doesn't hinder the film at all. It's still somehow stunning to see the depths of corruption and depravity revealed and it's all brought about in entirely organic ways that really help to feed into the emotional response. The only real downside though is that this movie knows exactly what it is and there are moments where it lays it on a little too heavy for me and has me rolling my eyes. The score in the first third of the movie really stood out to me because it seemed like with every transition we were getting this overly emotional music that felt like it should be spearheading The Days of Our Lives or something with how melodramatic it was.Still, Spotlight is a great movie. It's a movie I think people should be checking out and one I'm a little shocked hasn't gotten more attention than this. I like to think I'm pretty engrossed in cinema, at least in so much as an average movie buff can be, but I heard so little about this one save for the rare mention in a podcast now and then or when being briefly mentioned as an Oscar snub. Perhaps that's because it's not overly flashy and instead relies on substance to drive itself. Regardless, strong recommend, especially for those with a penchant for moving, based on a true story films. Going to be adding it to the collection as soon as I can find a copy."
" Great flick
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,10,"I don't believe what a movie was this it totally deserves the Oscar for the best movie of 2015. I usually try to stay away from the winners of the Oscar because they choose the wrong movie but this one is simply clever, intriguing and makes you think."
" ""Spotlight"" review
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,8,"«Spotlight» is an American fact-based dramatic film, released in 2015. It was directed by Tom McCarthy and written by McCarthy and Josh Singe. The film is dedicated to the «Spotlight» team, an American newspaper, which investigated cases of numerous child sex abuses in the Boston area by Roman Catholic priests. «Spotlight» was based on stories by people who worked there at that time and participated in the investigation of this horrifying case. The film stars Mark Ruffalo as Michael Rezendes, Michael Keaton as Walter ""Robby"" Robinson, Rachel McAdams as Sacha Pfeiffer, and John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Liev Schreiber as Ben Bradlee Jr., Mitchell Garabedian and Marty Baron.
Fr. John Geoghan was arrested for child molestation in 1976, but a high ranking cleric had a conversation with the mother of the children and the priest was released without people knowing about the case.
In 2001, Marty Baron, who worked as a new managing editor of The Boston Globe, met Walter ""Robby"" Robinson, the editor of the newspaper's ""Spotlight"" investigative team. Baron found out about a lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, who knew about Geoghan's sexual abuse of children and did nothing to stop him, he urged the Spotlight team to investigate. Journalist tried to do their best to obtain justice, but while their investigation they learnt even more shocking news they were terrified by.
Overall, this movie was difficult to watch for me, not because it was filmed poorly, but because it was very hard to overcome emotionally, especially when you know that it all was real. These dreadful things happened before and might happen know when we do not even suspect. The actors played their characters brilliantly From time to time I had goose-bombs by the acting of villains. I recommend the film for watching to people who have an interest for investigations and drama."
" ""Spotlight""
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,8,"The movie I would like to write about is ""Spotlight"", a 2015 American biographical drama film directed by Tom McCarthy. The film follows The Boston Globe's ""Spotlight"" team, the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative journalist unit in the United States, and its investigation into cases of widespread and systemic child abuse in the Boston area by numerous Roman Catholic priests.
To begin with, it is necessary to note the plot of the story, slowly evolving and showing the world as it really is. In the course of the development of the plot, the viewer learns more and more details of this case, but this can not be called something shocking, in my opinion, this is just a statement of facts. Despite the fact that, unfortunately, nowadays stories related to child abuse are far from rare, the director managed to show that the problem is much more global than we think. ""Spotlight"" shows a deeper truth, the level of psychological trauma brought on by abuse, not just to the victims, but to horrified Catholics as well. The story touches not just a crime, but a crime that happened within the walls of the church, where people come in search of peace and faith. So, ""Spotlight"" takes faith seriously, but after such stories, it is very difficult to believe that something good remains in our world.
In addition, the film pays great attention to the scrupulous journalistic investigation. It is a story of unglamorous leg-work rather than thundering revelation. The main characters have to try to get witnesses, victims and rapists to talk, they seek the publication of court decisions, they link publicly available facts just like real detectives do. The journalists have not only the outcome of the case on the line but also their own reputation. The drama here comes from the detail and the reporters' slow realisation that their investigation could change the world far beyond Boston's city limits. The Church's power is revealed as smoke, mirrors, and an unwarranted sense of deference, with journalism at its best proving its worth.
Finally, it is impossible not to mention the great acting of the cast. The characters are another important component of the picture, and they are not only superbly spelled out, but also brilliantly played. The main characters' personalities are revealed in the course of the plot with the help of discreet details, without distracting from the main plot. For example, we can see how Sasha Pfeiffer (played by Rachel McAdams) tries to protect to the last her religious grandmother from the cruel truth. Each character is an individuality, each of their action is a step forward, each thought is a breakthrough. These people did a just cause for the benefit of their fellow citizens, and the actors played the roles of real invisible heroes, those whose hands did justice when the courts, police, and prosecutors were powerless.
To conclude, I should say this film can be called an extremely specific, but very inspiring spectacle presented by the director and the cast. In my opinion, the film is very multifaceted, as it touches on the issues of religion, freedom of speech, and independence of the court, and also proves that the media can really be considered the fourth estate. It is scary, but over 15 years, little has changed, so who knows, maybe the film will help someone open their eyes to something."
" They dare shine the spotlight when other prefer to keep to the dark side
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,8,"Perfectly directed by Tom McCarthy, 'Spotlight' lets the viewer go beyond the curtain of investigative journalism and look closely at what kind of character it takes. The based on actual events story goes around the Boston Globe investigative team, dealing with the case of Catholic church authorities, who have been molesting children for years still not facing any penalty as far as under the systematic protection of the Cardinal Law. The cast's brilliant acting makes it possible to deliver the story at its highest. Sacha Pfeiffer, played by Rachel McAdams, shows exactly the type of journalist, questioning and digging out the evidence whatever it takes to find out the truth alongside Mike Rezendes, portrayed by Mark Ruffalo, who sacrifices his personal life, working 24/7 to make sure that justice will prevail. Not to forget the team editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), who plays one of the fundamental roles in the case, making the right decisions when required and serving as a strategy man who fights not the individual priests but dares to attack the powerful institution as he believes the pattern is not changing until the system is.The film makes me think more about the matter and how it is important than ever to support independent journalism. Protecting civil rights, journalists risk their lives to provide the opportunity for people to be heard and investigate the issues that the corrupt police do not. Especially in the era of fake news, when even governments and authorities - aimed at maintaining the law - might be the main violators of it while having all the resources to cover up the crimes and spread disinformation through the governmental mass media. Who else but journalists reveal the evil side of the state? As in the case of Alexei Navalny, when reporters from CNN and Bellingcat introduced to the world the evidence that the agents of Russian Federal Security Service used the prohibited chemical weapon against the citizen of the Russian Federation, and still there is not even an official inquiry. A horrifying fact to think over. All in all, it remains to the reader to gain the necessary information literacy skills to distinguish hoax from the truth.Moving to the pros and cons of the film, the first thing to mention is the cast's ability to transfer sincere emotions as if they let you get through the events as a participant. One more thing to pay attention to is Tom McCarthy's way to scrupulously deliver the investigating process with all its ups and downs, which in reverse is a disadvantage because this sacrifices the dynamics of the film. Lastly, the raised problem and its development might not leave the viewer indifferent. The film is well worth seeing!"
" The importance of investigative journalism by the example of child molestation by priests
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,10,"Warning: you won't see obscene illicit actions of priests in this film. The survivors of the child molestation won't tell you much of their experience as well. The thing is that ""Spotlight"" is not about how bad the Church is. The main focus of it - to show people the importance of investigative journalism and to confirm the fact that the truth always comes up.""Spotlight"" is The Boston Globe's team of investigative journalists who are working on series of the child sex abuse cases by numerous Catholic priests. Being put in confrontation with the most powerful institution of the society they fight against its aspiration to hush up the deeds of the abusive priests who infringe on the innocence of children. At first the journalists struggled to find the information since everyone kept silent but then, bit by bit, they managed to convince interested parties to switch to their side and the silence was broken.Every detail of the ""Spotlight"" is concentrated on the investigation process: it shows the ways of getting information by the team, its endless paper work and the ritual of making notes at every opportunity; all the failures and all the doors slammed in your face. Throughout the film, I felt like I was inside the whole process, I became a part of it.The member of the Spotlight team Mike Rezendes who made the great effort to contribute to this investigation said: ""They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you, it could've been me, it could've been any of us."" After these words something changes in you. When shifting the stories of the survivors to yourself you realize how the sexual abuse could possibly have changed your life. Then the question arise: What would I do to stop it?The importance of the investigative journalism is not to be questioned. Journalists spill the secrets about which the government is silent, thus showing the public that the truth will always come up if there is someone to say it out loud."
" All reporters investigate - that's the nature of the job
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,10,"There is a strong connection between ""lie"" and ""death"". That is not only because a lie leads to the death of truth, but because it may also lead to the death of a human in both mental and physical sense. In such cases exposing a liar gets of high importance as it becomes equal to the rescue. And a striking story of such a rescue is covered in the film ""Spotlight"".The plot of ""Spotlight"" follows one of the most upsetting topics - institutional efforts to cover up the crimes. The whole story revolves around a small The Boston Globe team of investigative journalists which gets assigned to report on sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. The Spotlight team does its best to get to the bottom of the Boston Archdiocese's decades-long cover-up. The aim is to expose Cardinal and reveal a horrifying truth.The story and the film itself are emphasized by a brilliant cast including Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schreiber and Stanley Tucci. Although the personalities of their characters are not deeply shaped to maintain the focus on the plot, all the actors, to my mind, showed a great performance. Every supporting cast is strictly embedded, which is undoubtedly merit of the director Tom McCarthy.Being based on actual events the film seems to truly capture the power of investigative journalism. Unlike broadcast journalism, it doesn't focus on news that already exist and goes beyond the mere reporting of the day-to-day events. The aim of reporting journalism is to go in-depth to cover a single story, which often takes months if not years. The thing is, the road to the truth is not smooth, so one needs to make substantial effort to overcome a great amount of obstacles. That gets trickier when the obstacles are placed by the Church. However, as we can see, nothing is impossible. ""Spotlight"" proves that and makes a strong point about the critical press and the importance which it has for society.""Spotlight"" is not one of those films that you will forget about in a day. The film intelligently and deliberately depicts a horrifying true story and a real investigation. It is not an easy watch, but, no doubt, ""Spotlight"" really deserves all of the accolades it has received."
" The importance of investigative journalism
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,9,"Terrible things happen very often in our world. We live and sometimes do not even suspect that something terrifying can happen right behind your back. But the worst thing is to know about such things and do nothing.
«Spotlight» by director Tom McCarthy is an American biographical drama film released in 2015 that tells the riveting true story of the Boston Globe investigation about mass children molestation performed by Boston priests.
In 2001, The Boston Globe's ""Spotlight"" team, consisting of editor Walter ""Robby"" Robinson and reporters Mike Rezendes, Sacha Pfeiffer and Matt Carroll, began investigating allegations of cover-ups of sexual abuse within the Massachusetts Roman Catholic Church. Initially faced with a handful of violations, the number of possible cases grew from 4 to 13 to an astounding 90. After following leads, interviewing victims and lawyers, and devoting months to the effort, the reporters wrote the story in early 2002 and triggered a tsunami that swept across the country and around the world.
It is worth mentioning the cast of the film. Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAddams and Liev Schreiber are familiar to the audience. All of them are professionals of their craft, proving their high professionalism by previous successful works in the cinema. In fact, the film has no main roles. Boston Globe journalists are shown as a team capable of conducting the most complex and desperate investigations. But they are ordinary people, not superheroes from comics, so the accuracy of the game of each of the actors deserves the highest ratings.
I think the film is worth watching, as it shows that inaction can cost someone's life. The church has always been considered a sacred place and the priests were called to love and protect people. But as it turned out, even in the most sacred place, there may not be anything sacred. This film shows us how the lives and souls of children are broken by those who are called to protect these children.
Moreover, this film shows how important it is to tell people the truth. Throughout the film, journalists investigate and fight for the truth. For the sake of their investigation, they are not ready to exchange and compromise either with representatives of the church or with representatives of the official authorities of Boston. It was the struggle of journalists for the truth that allowed them to reveal the terrible facts about the priests and saved thousands of children's lives.
Considering all this, I would highly recommend this film to everyone who likes drama films based on real facts."
" An excellent film, but it makes an erroneous association between clerical celibacy and child abuse.
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the most interesting films I have seen in recent times. The script is based on real facts, namely the journalistic investigation that publicized the scandal of child abuse in the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston, USA. However, the film goes further and establishes a link between these investigation and similar scandals that have happened in other countries.I am a historian, but I am also an employee of the Catholic Church. I am not a priest, but I work with many priests, and I have some friends in the priesthood. So, I have a vision of the interior of the Church that most people don't have. And the Church, in spite of being universal, is also fragile and has an increasing fear of what can be said about her. It is understandable: the strength of the Church resides in people who go to Mass, make offerings, help with charitable works and collaborate. And, despite the weight the Church still has, it has been questioned in traditionally Catholic regions such as the Mediterranean, Latin America and USA. There are fewer baptisms and marriages, the social weight of the clergy is secondary, there are fewer candidates for the priesthood and the number of practitioners has decreased. The Church is strong and powerful, but it is increasingly isolated and discredited. This is a concern for the Catholics and the fear of public opinion explains why the Church tries to solve problems with minimal waves.The issue of celibacy is addressed as one of the causes of child abuse. I do not believe that. It is true that priests were never exemplary in chastity, but it is also true that this has been a rule imposed on the clergy for over a thousand years. The Church does not expel priests who ""fall into temptation"", but invites them to think about what they want and demands that they assume their responsibilities with consistency and honesty. As for child abuse... there is no justification. Evil can be forgiven, never justified. Justifying child abuse with celibacy implies thinking that this will end if the priests get married. But there are a lot of married men who also abuse children. The truth is simple: there are people who have wrong or criminal instincts and inclinations, some of them have sought refuge in the Church. But child abuse will continue to exist with or without a celibate clergy.The film has an excellent cast where I would highlight, for the quality of the work done, the names of Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAddams and Liev Schreiber, which brought the investigative journalists of Spotlight magazine to the Boston Globe. Another actor I liked to see here was Stanley Tucci, in the role of a lawyer who worked with the accused priests.The film took very good advantage of the original material and the real facts on which it is based, and creates a wonderful story by the way it follows the efforts of journalists to discover more and more about the abuse of minors and the position of the local cardinal. The pace, which is deliberately slow, allows it to build gradually without losing the thread of the story. The absence of great effects, a showy cinematography or an overly incisive soundtrack allows us to focus on the story and the work of the cast. And that was a conscious and intelligent option of the production, which knew how to have at hand what was necessary to build an excellent film, dispensing with the stylistic artifices and giving almost a documentary note to a film that is largely fictional."
" The film that amazed me - ""Spotlight""
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,10,"The film that amazed me - ""Spotlight"". The film tells a real story about journalists' investigation about churches. The film doesn't let you get bored and keeps it tense for 2 hours. One of the most worthy oscar winners, and arguably one of the most powerful movies in last decade.Very colorful characters. Competent acting work. One of the strongest roles of Ruffalo. Nice dramatic play by the lovely and cute Rachel McAdams. Michael Keaton is good too. Liv Schreiber played a cool character for surprise and a cool role.Events develop very dynamically, accompanied by brilliant music. The movie is steeped in this music and it's gorgeous. That movie when you dive into and enjoy the movie, which also gives the mountain food for thoughts. How not to close your eyes to what is happening, how to strive for heights, how to go against corruption. The film absorbs into its atmosphere, and you, together with this team, experience every meeting and every dialogue. Insanely beautiful picture.My review turned out to be so short, rather because I did not stop at the moments. This is not a reason to think that there are no good moments. Scenes with Ruffalo, scenes with brilliant music, final scene, choir scene. All these scenes are gorgeous, it's just that for me this film is not divided into moments, it is a full sentimental and strong story, with a gorgeous cast and brilliant music."
" A Fascinating Look at Investigative Journalism
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,10,"""Spotlight"" follows the story of the real-life Boston Globe's Spotlight team in the early 2000s, as they investigated the long-ranging cover up of priest molestation.It has an incredible cast (Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Brian d'Arcy James, and Stanley Tucci) who portray the subject with seriousness and sensitivity, as well as showing how a major newspaper worked in the early days of the internet.Like a massive puzzle that gradually comes together, the story becomes engrossing as the extent of the cover ups are exposed, as the Spotlight team interview victims, deal with editorial pressure, face opposition from the Catholic Church, and deal with the fallout from 9/11. The ending is powerful, with more molestation victims coming forward, proving that all the hard work and frustration was worth it.While modern-day journalism has been compromised by the instant gratification of social media, throwaway pop-culture listicles, and superficial 'clickbait' articles, ""Spotlight"" shows that proper investigative journalism can have a lasting impact and can change the world for the better."
" Stressful story to tell but done extremely well
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,8,There are no needs to talk about this cast.I mean only the best actors and actresses were chosen for this film.I find it slow at beginning but after some tome it's catching up faster pace. Definitely Oscar-deserved movie with the true story that made me speechless. The ending when they show where around the world this all happened i was just shocked.Thankfully the problem that this movie shows is partly solved now and I'm so happy because of it.
" must watch
",2020-10-02 00:00:00,9,"Very well made and inspiring move that exposes dirty face of church in America, its shocking to know how greatest democratic country in world USA is still controlled by church mafia"
" Kept me glued to the screen.
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,8,"You might call this film manipulative and tabloid-like, but I believe it truly and honestly expresses something that should resonate within everyone, especially within those who were raised Catholics. The ""it could have been me or anyone"" feeling the whole story conveys really got to me. The movie inspired anger, fear, further loss of faith and even relief a priest didn't look at me at a time I couldn't have said no."
" Excellent
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,8,"I do love a good investigative drama procedural like the near perfect All The President's Men. This doesnt come up to that high water mark but is certainly not a million miles off.The quiet performance of Liev Schreiber and the terrier like lawyer of Stanley Tucci were particular standouts with the rest being on fine form too feeling like everyone played a strong part in telling the story.The script is very good even though at times it strays into melodrama which given the subject matter can be forgiven, no pun intended.I liked the pace which it cracked along at with the investigation moving along swiftly without getting too bogged down or going so fast as not to be understandable."
" This Is How Historical Drama Is Done
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,10,"""Spotlight"" is the story of reporters from The Boston Globe who uncovered the Catholic priest sexual abuse scandal in the early 2000s. The story moves at a brisk pace as the layers of abuse and coverup are peeled back through more and more investigative journalism. We get a good look into journalism and the business of newspapers as well, with our main reporters fending off attacks and threats from rival newspapers, the church, and lawyers. I really like how we are shown the nitty-gritty of how news sources get their information.Mark Ruffalo is probably the standout to me in this film. He does a really good job as Michael Rezendes, a real life journalist who helped break the story. The movie's pacing is just something I can't get over, it's really phenomenal the sense of urgency and how against the clock the characters feel to make sure that these stories are told with the proper light that they need, in order to prevent further burial from the church.It's also worth noting that the movie is not explicitly anti-Catholic or anything like that. It shows us the dark and unexposed secrets that the church leadership had successfully covered up for decades. In fact, although I am not a Catholic myself, I think members of that faith should feel all the more inclined to see this movie.""Spotlight"" is a great one, and I think that it tells us a story that definitely needs to be heard again and again, and never forgotten."
" A true spotlight

" A Scary Story, but one that needed to be told
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,8,"This was a team effort. Definitely deserving of the SAG award for Best Cast. There was no star bigger than another They all had chemistry that blended greatly with each other. The story was a powerful one, and if you think of it, it's kind of a horror story in a way. No one should ever have to deal with being abused, and it takes a lot of power to even admit it happened. The fact that this was based on a true story is even scarier."
" More like a documentary
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,4,"This film covers a deeply troubling and impactful topic, but the way it is executed is like a documentary. It is too straightforward with the way it presents straight facts over and over again. We get a repetitive cycle of a reporter talking to this source, then another reporter talking to another source, and so on. From time to time we get bigger insights about the emotional impact of abuse on the victims, the heavy role of the Catholic Church in this society and how the lawyers always know more than they let on, but overall I felt this film was too much of a straight retelling of facts."
" Told in a simple and captivating way
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,8,"After its Best Picture win, I wondered what was so good about Spotlight and after seeing it, I now know why.Spotlight tells the story of a few reporters working at the Boston Globe who discover a huge scandal happening within the Catholic Church.What I really loved was the way this story was told. The direction Tom McCarthy took by making these reporters seem like everyday people made this movie not feel like a movie. It felt like I was actually watching reporters unearth this crazy scandal as it went on. There is no sugarcoating or loud scenes where the actors seem to give their Oscar moment. Everyone is incredibly restrained and it's this simplicity which makes Spotlight feel so real. The story itself is very engaging. As the film went on and more secrets got revealed, I was shocked every time and couldn't believe how this was a true story. The editing is terrific as there isn't a boring moment. I was so interested in the story that I couldn't believe how quickly 2 hours went by. I do think the soundtrack could have been better.The performances are outstanding. Everyone is incredibly restrained and reacts in a way that seems very genuine. It's great to see Michael Keaton deliver another great performance after his success with Birdman. Mark Ruffalo gives one of his best, Rachel McAdams is also great and Liev Schrieber is fantastic. All the cast members seemed believable in their roles and added to the authenticity of the story.Whilst Spotlight is an intriguing watch, I don't feel the need to watch it again but I would definitely recommend it as I think it's worth your time."
" Soulful and heart warming
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,9,"A movies that puts life into all those black & white words we read in the print media. The journey which the spotlight team takes as they uncover their story takes us through the great dilemmas and hardships faced by people working so hard to bring to us the news stories. The spotlight teams is a portrayed beautifully with each character highlighting in a way one of the core attributes of a journalist. Mark Ruffalo's Michael acts as the heart of the systems, truly searing in the pain of his finding as he uncovers more hidden mysteries. Micheal Keaton as Robby portrays the mind of the system as despite the astounding and tumultuous discoveries, tries to keep a level head and steer his team in the right direction. Rachael McAdams' Sasha is hard work and grind, persistent and relentless in her efforts to reach out and find more voices. Brian d'arcy James' Matty not only is diligent in his work but at the same time cannot let go of his empathy when he relates the situation with his immediate surroundings. Even the other characters are shown beautifully. The movie is also a visual delight throughout.1 - 10 Aug 20"
" A Masterpiece
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,10,"With outstanding direction from McCarthy, and some brilliant performances from all the incredibly talented actors involved, Spotlight doesn't just prove to be the best movie of the year, but one of the better films ever made. Its story is quite shocking, and it deals with the material quite respectfully, but what is most impressive is that it never feels like the information is being shoved down our throats. McCarthy and Singer, who wrote the script for the film, write very delicately with the information provided, and do it in a way that can be incredibly accurate and shocking without ever seeming like a burden to follow. The cast in the film is fantastic. All actors provide a great job, but I must say that Michael Keaton was truly snubbed by the awards ceremonies for his performance as Walter Robinson (aka Robbie). His performance isn't just accurate, but truly emotional, and Keaton brings his absolute best to his role, continuing his fantastic acting streak since the previous best picture winner- Birdman. Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo also provide terrific performances in their roles respectively, and I find it seriously dumbfounding how none of these actors were nominated for the credit they so deserve. The film isn't just entertaining, but with a film so bound on just human beings and their experiences, it is truly amazing how the film can be so thrilling and suspenseful to watch. This isn't an ordinary 'based on a true story' scenario, although their are a couple of moments that may seem like it is so. This is far beyond that precedent, and this film sets a new precedent in return, marking not only a creative and brilliant filmmaking achievement, but a truly outstanding work of art that will be viewed for many years to come. On top of the brilliant direction, writing, and acting, the cinematography also shines in this film with its grounded but naturally beautiful approach, and I couldn't help but awe at the detail and thought put into every frame. In the end, Spotlight isn't just a great film, its a masterpiece, and I encourage anyone who hasn't seen it, regardless of their beliefs or views, to give it a try. You won't regret it.
My Rating: 10/10"
" Boston at its best and worst
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,9,"Having grown up catholic in the Boston area, this is a difficult subject for me. The film dealt well with the extent to which people will protect the church, but also with what Boston considers its people versus outsiders. If you go along with everything and protect its institutions, you are one of us. If not, you are an outsider.Like the other scandals that broke out all over the world after this, it's easy to see why some people will try to protect an institution they choose to believe is good. But it also does an excellent job of showing how once the scope of those mistakes becomes clear that you realize you are not protecting the good, but enabling the evil."
" A really great movie based on an even greater group of people who brought these disgusting crimes to light.
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,8,"No matter how accurate the characters are to the real reporters, or the drama scenes to real life criminal law, watching movies like this serve to inform others of real life events in a way that holds their attention. Themes were the abuse of religion for power, harm that can come from trusting blindly those in a seat of power, what happens when people turn their backs to let bad things happen. It was a good movie that kept my attention, was able to talk about religious corruption without degrading religion itself, and was able to get in a large story pretty well into the about 2 hour period it had."
" Good topic. Bad acting.
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,2,"Good concept, and important topic, but unfortunately the acting is too fake or ""tv movie"" to watch. Michael Keaton brings a little realism to the acting. Screenplay is fine, but basically monotone and predictable."
" Truly captures the power of investigative journalism.
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,9,"This is one of the rare movies which is so real in it's approach and the way it was shot. It really captures the power of investigative journalism. It is based on a true story and it has done justice to all the characters who were involved in the investigation. The director has tried to keep the story real and authentic. None of the scenes were over the top or over dramatic. The acting was also spot-on. The movie emphasized on the importance of good and powerful journalism and the impact it can have on the system, which is sometimes so corrupted and cruel."
" Thrilling insight into investigative journalism
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,8,"Excellently dramatized story based on true events. Very well written, played and directed. Great immersion into the world of journalism and making a strong point about how important critical press is for society. Strong characters that burn for their work which gives them purpose and who don't back off in their fight against an overwhelming power that seems above the law. Very moving film that holds its grip on the spectator until the last minute."
" I've always enjoy movie that in line with the type of concusion
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,9,"I don't know if this is based on a book, but i want to appreciate the rich plot that makes this movie not cringy and very realistic in covering the world of journalism. The type of the movie that you would enjoy in the weekend, because it is very heavy topic and very heavy dialogue, it would be not enjoyable if you watch it after work."
" Great Movie
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,8,"It runs like ""All the President's Men"".
My father always told me, if you want to kill someone and get away with it, become a cop. If you want to molest children and get away with it, become a priest."
" Oof
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,10,"Tough, tough watch. Handled a delicate and heart-wrenching happening with grace and without sensationalizing anything. I was very very glad that there were absolutely no flash-backs to these things happening, just verbal accounts from the survivors. The shame from being hurt like that... it's all so so sad.These kids were told by everyone they loved and respected shut up and take it like a kid. And all this published right after 9/11, historically no wonder morale was so low. Can't believe in safety, can't even turn to the church for help. And then at the end the FOUR PAGES of FOUR (I think) columns with more proof of child abuse. How can this happen in a house of god. And then those men allowed to stay? Why does anyone think this is right and holy? They KEEP them in positions of power. How is that right.Anyway, all actors outstanding. Loved the film. Just deeply upset by it. Immediately turned on ""An Interview with God"" to be like..... what the h*ll man..."
" Incredible story
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,8,An incredible story that feels like it's told in a realistic way. The acting is great and the characters are well cast. The story moves at a quick pace but the information and storyline are well laid out. A great docudrama.
" Truly a masterpiece in the investigation type
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,10,"Truly a masterpiece in the investigation type, it make love the work of those journalists their ethics and their commitment, it's so touching because it's a true story of many molested child"
" Spotlight
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,8,"The whole movie is like a good news report itself. It tells the story, introduces people, looks for evidence and solves difficulties. Calm and clear, it is said that it is also very appropriate for the real office and living environment of journalists. Of course, in order to maintain this tone, the story of the news itself has been weakened, and the character of the reporter itself can not be deeply shaped."
" It has an excellent script...
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,8,"It has an excellent script, compelling performances and an accurate depiction of real events and a deep exploration of its controversial subject matter, but it lacks the emotional gravitas and drama to make it deserver for a best picture Oscar."
" Not often that a film truly entertains as well as informs...
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,9,"Sometimes, a film of this type makes a real impact... just sometimes... But, it very often doesn't have any impact at all like in the case of movies like Dark Waters (Dupont) or Deepwater Horizon (BP) or Love & Other Drugs (Pfizer/Eli Lilly) or The Big Short (Banks) or Thank You For Smoking (Tobacco)... I'd like to think that this film had at least a measurable impact on society and more specifically, the amount of sexual abuse cases in religion... and that in itself, is commendable.The film does a good job not only focusing on the main cast of characters, but also spends some time focusing on the sub-supporting characters, like the 'survivors' in the film and spends a good amount of time on the investigative part of the whole story as well... journalism like this didn't just fall out of the sky... it took months and months of hard researching and interviewing many many different people...They obviously took some creative license wrt. the events and timeline of certain parts of the film, but overall about 90% of the events shown in the film actually happened. And overall it's a good film and a fantastic docu-movie that should be viewed by all at least once."
" With the power of a few people, how to change the world.
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,9,"Although the film uses a very plain narrative to tell the reporters'collection work, many places have shocked my heart! I even cried! It's a good movie! Dirty, evil and even abnormal conditions exist in every corner of the world. Fortunately, a group of kind, just and brave people have built up layers of defense for us. We are glad to have them."
" Compelling and Important
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,9,"There have been many great films about journalism like All the President's Men and Zodiac and Spotlight can easily stand along side them.Spotlight focuses on a small team of investigative journalists who get assigned a story to report on sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. Their investigation leads to them finding a big cover-up by the Church and the city of Boston being complicit.The filmmakers showed the scale of the investigation by this small team with some scenes being similar to All the President's Men, the cover-up, and a sense of dread and urgency. The filmmakers got an ensemble cast and they portrayed their characters as realistic, hard-working people who had flaws.A great and important film."
" I am Speechless ! A Spotlight on Physical and Spiritual abuse that will leave you in Jitters.
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,9,"Spotlight (2015) :
Brief Review -I am Speechless ! A Spotlight on Physical and Spiritual abuse that will leave you in Jitters. Spotlight is based on true events that will shock you from inside to outside and it is also the possibility that it might take a few moments for you to come out of the shock (as it did to me). Cinema is just not a medium of entertainment, experiments and money spinner flicks but it is Medium that shows you an unknown and untold reality which is important for you to live in the society. Spotlight is a story about Child abusing events which had been covered by religious demons and some media freaks for the sake of God's status. Then, one media house took an interest into it and discovered some mind shaking realities which led them to the core of thier mind and involved them emotionally. Spotlight is not at all melodramatic, even though it had the all the potential to run around emotional spinner and make it a tear-jerker. Tom McCarthy didn't think that way, he kept it away from cinematic elements, he chose realistic theme and I don't know somehow it still brought tears in eyes for a moment. He didn't even try to showcase the big cast as heroes or saviours. McCarthy believed on his writing and made it heroic rather than anything else in the film. Among all the films won Oscars in the kast decade Spotlight was one real deserving holder. I hate Oscars for being manipulative so many times though, it wouldn't have made any difference to me. Also i found Spotlight as one of the most Important and Essential Classic made in Hollywood. This film needs to be seen to know some insane facts and we need to take a step forward to support such disasters if occurred anytime in future. I wanted to say more about many scenes in the film but i don't want to give any spoilers so just watch it and there's not a single chance of you disliking it. One of the Best Films of The Decade. Period.. A Masterpiece !RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest"
" Engaging Ensemble Drama.
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,8,"An excellent screenplay as well as directing, Spotlight is a haunting reminder of a story that deserves the attention brought by The Boston Globe. Michael Keaton and Ruffalo along with the rest of the supporting cast brings this movie to success. Journalism and Hollywood blend perfectly together in this film."
" spotlight
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,9,"This is not really a film that focuses on revealing the secrets of a scandal, but rather the normal work of journalists doing in-depth investigation. The story took place in 2001-2002, the eve when the Internet began to impact the news industry. Now, due to the convenience of information dissemination and access brought by the Internet, the professional aura of traditional journalists has faded away, and we can only enjoy their persistence, integrity and sense of honor in the film. At present, the sensitivity and tentacles of many journalists lag behind the network ""we media"". The traditional media is on the wane, and talents are flowing to the network media. News reports can be spread all over the Internet in minutes. News can only get cheaper, shallower, headline-grabbing, sensationalist.
The film offers a wonderful group performance, which highlights the charm of character in a slightly flat plot."
" The Devil really is in the detail.....
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,7,"This is definitely one of the better true-life exposé dramas of recent years - and given that it deals with a seriously sensitive subject - emotionally and politically - it delivers well and delicately. It's the story of a routine investigation by the ""Boston Globe"" into allegations of sexual misconduct levelled against a local priest, and soon spirals out of control into an internecine network of cover-ups and duplicity that shakes the Catholic church to it's very foundations. I was not brought up in a religious environment, so can really only wonder, aghast, at the clever manipulation of young innocents by these supposed paragons of their communities - and of the sheer cynicism of the hierarchies - internal and external - that facilitated the abhorrent behaviour that has all to frequently been carried out with impunity. Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo are very good, understated even, as the journalists on the scent of the story; ably assisted by Rachel McAdams and Stanley Tucci as the very streetwise lawyer who ultimately helped them to combat the mighty establishment that stands against them."
" Masterpiece!
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,10,"Folks!
Don't come close to listening to the wannabee critics who have scored below 6. That's what they are, wannabees!This is a complex movie, based on a comprehensive case. It is so good that I would have seen it as a mini-series.Just think about the worldwide impact after the Boston Globe revealed the systematic cover operation of the church, lawyers, government and not least the media itself. This movie is worth your time!"
" Always like the real-life movie
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,9,"Although the film uses a very plain narrative to tell the reporters'collection work, many places have shocked my heart! I even cried! It's a good movie!"
" Based on a true story sadly

I recommend you watch this, it's eye opening!"
" I think it is always necessary to tell such stories.
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,9,"The team spirit of the crew is just like a wonderful group performance, finishing a very high degree of completion of the film.Calm and restrained, objective but not yet sensational.I know that such things may not be rare, I believe that there are thousands of journalists who are not afraid of the power, do not set up a field, only to pursue the justice of the truth, speak for the disadvantaged groups.I also know that people in all walks of life have to adhere to their ideals, because of this, because of the existence of such a person, I can insist on trying to grow into such a person. I think it is always necessary to tell such stories, because only such stories can make people see more hope and work hard for it."

",2020-05-02 00:00:00,9,"If you haven't watched this one yet, check it out. Great to see a movie with a story for a change. No need for special effects if the story is solid."
" Don't turn this film the other way
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,7,"The subject matter is revolting but the way it is exposed by reporters at the Boston Globe newspaper is excellent. The investigative journalism of the ""Spotlight"" reporters of the Globe in revealing sordid child abuse amongst some members of the Roman Catholic Church reminded me of All The President's Men in the expose of Watergate.Michael Keaton is undergoing somewhat of a career renaissance from his superhero Batman days of the late 1980s here as chief Spotlight reporter Walter ""Robby"" Robinson however it is co-star Mark Ruffalo as hot-headed reporter Mark Rezendes who displays the best scenes in arguments about publishing findings immediately before the full extent of the scandal in Boston is investigated.The film is not a witch hunt against honest members of the Roman Catholic Church it has other elements to the story. Most notably the ""turn the other way"" attitudes of people in decades gone buy who could have exposed what was going on many years before. What I do find interesting about these true stories is the cards left on screen at the end. A sort of what happened next. A film that has to be viewed so hopefully this sort of thing never happens again and no organisation can cover it up."
" First
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,8,"The whole movie is like an excellent news report itself, stating the ins and outs, introducing characters, looking for evidence, and solving difficulties. Calm and organized, it is said that the real reporter's office and living environment are also restored properly. Of course, in order to maintain this tone, the story of the news itself is weakened, and the personality pf the reporter cannot be deeply shaped."
" A well written biopic
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,7,"A film that starts off average for the first half hour but turns into something very compelling. This biopic might not be for everyone since the subject matter can be pretty disturbing and uncomfortable. But it definitely made me feel something at the end of the movie.The interviews with the victims made you understood how bad this scandal really was and they never shy away from telling you how unsettling it was to have someone you trust do things that disturb you. For that I commend this movie. Mark Ruffalo gives the performance of his career. I also liked the small scene at the end with Rachel McAdams and her grandma reading the article toward the end.Some issues are the first 30 minutes before the plot really gets going. It felt inconsequential to the rest of the movie. Also some characters aren't as well developed as others, I didn't really care about anyone outside of the spotlight team.Overall I recommend this movie as long as you can handle the touchy subject matter"
" A work that proves how enjoyable it can be to watch movies..
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,9,"I think it's a worthy film to be enjoyed watching .The fact that the subject was taken from a real event and a subject so important to society is very beautifully worked out. The added value of the actors makes the film much more beautiful. Also, the music of the film is very successful."
" Journalism at its finest gets its time in the 'Spotlight'
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,9,"Newsrooms are often prime settings for gripping dramas. Whether about a political scandal like in 'All the President's Men,' a war scandal like in 'The Post' or a religious scandal like in 'Spotlight,' these films have the ingredients needed to keep audiences on the edge of their seats. 'Spotlight' in particular is a standout thanks to the A-list cast and the difficult storytelling required given the somber subject matter.A best picture and best original screenplay winner, 'Spotlight' truly earned these accolades thanks to Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer for outstanding writing. As we've seen many times before, a film can have a great ensemble, but they can easily fall flat if the writing isn't top-notch. Here, we see the likes of Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schreiber and Stanley Tucci build on each others' talents as the Boston Globe Spotlight team does its best to get to the bottom of the Boston Archdiocese's decades-long coverup of priest sexual abuse.Again, this is heavy stuff, but the way the pieces come together is really remarkable. Ruffalo's no-BS portrayal of reporter Mike Rezendes is a particular highlight, as he clearly will stop at nothing to get to the bottom of the story. Keaton also does an admirable job as the spotlight team leader - his background making things more complicated as he tries to navigate the tangled web that is the ""system"" in place between Boston politics and the Catholic Church.There are some films that just stand on their own two feet without needing explanation for their brilliance. 'Spotlight' is definitely one of those."
" Spot-on Spotlight
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,8,The film roughly roams around the investigative journalism about the child molestation and sexual abuse of children linked with the Catholic Churches. This type of bold topics are always tricky because depicting some religious scandals and controversies always generates criticism which sometimes goes beyond the expectations which might halt the release of the movie or may turn into total disaster. However despite of its bold theme in nature based on true events this film somehow got lucky as the film was not only got positive reception from Catholic community but also got praises from them acknowledging the accuracy of events and how originally the story and journalists helped them to identify this sinful act. The screenplay of the movie is one of the tightest and best I've come a crossed supported by crunch direction and some fine work by the seasoned actors including Michael Keaton.
" Changes the way you will look at life
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,9,"POSITIVES:.How doesn't Michael Keaton have an Oscar yet?!?! He's incredible
.The editing and cinematography are fantastic, long takes and beautiful camera movements
.Doesn't shy away from its subject matter at allNEGATIVES:.Very picky but there was one too many montages for my liking
.Also, the opening couple scenes: the flashback in 1976 and the globe employees leaving celebration are a slow start and both feel out of place"
" Takes no prisoners
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,9,"Had I researched ""Spotlight"" in advance, it would have been the last thing I would have wanted to watch. Browsing through the range on offer on Netflix, I had recently watched two quite lengthy series, one a documentary about an attempt to cover up sexual abuse by a priest, the other a fictional murder investigation. ""Spotlight"" should have seemed like deja vu, but the absolute excellence of this production soon captured me. There are plenty of interesting characters depicted by some really excellent actors, but nothing at all distracts from the progress of the investigation. I can't say how much I admire the avoidance of subplots, and fact that no character is allowed to command attention more than briefly. The story is the thing, and it grows and grows in dimension as the unbelievable scale of the criminal activity and related coverups by church authorities is revealed, not letting up until the last minutes of the movie. I found the way church sympathisers were shown trying to silence the investigators, very convincing. The seekers after truth are not self-righteous do-gooders, they are ordinary people who are horrified and appalled by what they discover. The whole thing has the ring of truth, and I'm glad I watched it. I am deducting a point to rate it 9/10 because I found the action and dialogue at the start a bit messy and all over the place, til it gets really going. Some of the dialogue is hard to catch as it is slurred with words half swallowed. But this is a fleabite in an otherwise admirable production. Highly recommended."

",2020-04-10 00:00:00,10,"Spotlight is a solid film. This movie certainly helped me find my love for movies again, a well-made movie that I would recommend to any drama fan. Everything about this movie is outstanding. It is slow in starting but riveting to the end. The movie narrates the story with realistic characters, emotions and incredibly portrays the integrity and handwork. It feels like you are not watching a movie, but it's happening around you."
" Great story
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this film a lot, the true story being told is great and the film really captures the sadness of what's actually being told. I think it's great how they managed to tell a story that's actually got a lot of sadness involved and make it not just emotional but very captivating. If you like dramas and true stories this is definitely one to watch.
The acting was absolutely brilliant by everyone involved, just wanted to give a special mention to that.Only negative for me personally is that it is longer than it needs to be. Could feel myself thinking ""this must be coming to a close soon""
But overall worth watching in my opinion"
" Woah! What an experience.
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,9,"This film has a brilliant screenplay. The subject matter of the film is very important and very relevant nowadays. The cast is phenomenal. The music is unsettling, sad and fits perfectly into the film. It has some of the best dialogues ever put into film which make it extremely gripping and smart. It absolutely deserves its Best Picture win."
" The power of the media
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,8,"This is a film based on real people and real stories. The film revolves around the focus group in the Boston-based ""Global Times"", in-depth coverage of the Geoghan case.Generally, a movie marked with ""According to Real People"" always adds a layer of realistic meaning to the film, without the exaggerated shooting technique in the general movie narrative, the reversal of the plot, the focus on the lens and the story. Time clues can actually be regarded as a relatively bland movie. But when I watched the movie, I thought it was adapted based on the actual case, but it also made the characters in the movie come alive.The story begins with the new editor-in-chief airborne editorial department. The newly appointed editor-in-chief nominates the focus group to conduct an in-depth investigation into the Geoghan case and provide a comprehensive and detailed report. As the work of the team members unfolded, it was discovered that the case was only the tip of the iceberg, and the number of bishops who committed similar cases reached as much as 6%. Take the Boston area as an example, 1500 bishops. 6% is 90, the number is huge, it is staggering. What 's even more irritating is that the Archbishops and Bishops in the area have been aware of these things happening in the diocese, but they did not punish the criminal bishops. In the current parish, this practice has resulted in more children being abused. The reporters ran around and rushed to gather evidence at the node of time, before finally revealing the viciousness of the entire church system. They faced not just a regional religious belief, but a question directed at the Vatican. A person who preached in the name of God, a person who carried the faith of the believers in an entire region, was behind the well-dressed, doing things that are not as good as the beasts, and the entire church system was blind and indulgent. My faith was shaken and I was disappointed.God loves the world and becomes a joke.The film ended with a report of the ringing of the phone ringing in the focused office. With the support of public opinion, more and more victims chose to speak. The film did not give the actual ending of the incident, but gave an open end. After checking the Internet, after the Boston Times published nearly 600 reports, the church was forced to respond to public opinion pressure. All relevant personnel were jailed and the church fined more than 2 billion US dollars. The incident came to an end.This film is also a film focused on freedom of public opinion and religious power, and has a rare social depth. The reporter's persistence in justice and the maintenance of freedom in the film are also impressive. The most important thing in the profession of journalists is to have self-awareness as a public speaker. Use the pen as a gun, face the darkness, stick to the original intention, and dare to speak in the face of power. recommend!"
" Best film
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,8,"Powerful, absorbing and deeply moving, Spotlight is almost certainly the best film about journalism of at least the past decade. Probably more."
" Action film
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,8,"A very good movie, it is worth recommending.The martial arts action of the movie is very cool and very emotional."
" A good movie about the news
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,9,"The authenticity of the event is shocking! Systematic torture, portrayal of journalists' work (more dramatic Newsroom), attention to the progress of the event itself rather than indulging in cheap lyricism, and modest depictions of several major reporters with different perspectives and different attitudes...All these have set an example as the highest standard of this type of social biographical drama. Keep asking about something bigger. I think it should be the ultimate responsibility of all art forms."
" Catholic Church Fails All
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,9,"This is a very well covered story, brilliantly acted. Sadly, it is shockingly true and shows how disgraceful the whole hierarchy of the Catholic Church are. This is compounded by the fact that politics and the police did everything they could to cover up a systematic  wave.
This film shows how excellent journalism prevailed and against all odds fought the monster that is the Catholic Church. Watching The Keepers on Netflix confirms it.
This is brilliant."
" Amazing performance
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,9,Powerful and absolutely perfect storytelling. One of the best true story-telling movies.
" A movie that doesn't make people feel depressed
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,8,"Although the film revolves around sexual abuse of children, I do not feel depressed. I hope that more just journalists will uncover the truth and hope that those who choose silence for the benefit will eventually make the right decision"
" All cast members are so good and respectful.
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,10,"I can't tell in detail the shock I felt after watching this movie. Before that, I didn't know much about the issues discussed in the film. But when I watched this movie, I was deeply involved in the heavy, nervous and sadness that the movie brought me. You can't help but sigh, in the face of such a large and possibly sensitive topic, the film has a clear idea and a clear main line."
" NEWSROOM PROCEDURAL.
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,8,One of the best newsroom procedural I have ever seen. These people set aside their personal lives to report a story that changed the world. Stopped evil in the name of good. The way they portrayed the new Jewish editor from Florida was so understated.
" Must see
",2020-02-19 00:00:00,9,"This film should be watched by all, absolute disgraceful happenings within the Catholic Churches.. Acting believable and faultless... Makes you sick to them stomach.. Fantastic hard hitting film"
" 5 Years Later Spotlight is Still Great and Relevant
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,10,"I just watched the movie again, in 2020. The message is perhaps more relevant now: the need for searching, patient, in depth journalistic research and stories, especially when challenging authority, powerful institutions and ingrained assumptions. The film is fascinating, low key but suspenseful even though you know the story...and the fact that, almost two decades after the Boston Globe published its series on the cover-up by the highest levels of the Boston Catholic diocese of decades of sexual abuse of children by nearly 100 priests, it is still reverberating worldwide today. The script, direction and acting are excellent. Can't wait to see a film soon about how dogged, moral, heroic journalists bring down the current corrupt presiden and his enablers."
" Gripping story, Beautifully acted
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,9,"This is the kind of work ethics today's newspapers and reporters should hold on to. Hope we never lose that
""This is Spotlight."""
" Superb acting and affecting story
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,9,"A fantastic ensemble cast of actors excels in this film, which portrays a real-life investigation into a major child abuse scandal perpetrated by and covered up by the Catholic church in Boston over many years. The true and horrific scale of the abuse and the cover up becomes more evident as the small Spotlight team of investigative reporters delve deeper and reel from their findings. Watch the end credits to see just how far-reaching this scandal actually is."
" Great film
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,10,One of those films that I like more every time I see it.
" More people should see this!
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,9,"Sad, depressing, and true...
Whatever you believe, religious or not, you should see this. People don't want to talk about it, but I think we have to. Its why so many of them get away with it. The deafening silence... Of course you know what's worse? The fact that they intentionally hide these predators and protect them!"
" Superb
",2020-01-07 00:00:00,10,"This is what movies should be about. This is what real journalism looks like. Sadly, journalism has died in this country since then and been replaced by banal, mindless soap opera. Reporters today don't even know how to ask probing questions. This movie is a masterpiece."
" Intelligent and gripping
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,8,"An intelligent and gripping movie based by true events, packed with great performances."
" Great movie!
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,8,"This is an important movie. It's not really fun, or something I would frequently watch, but it is very important. It's very well-made and we'll-acted."
" Simply amazing
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,9,"As a huge fan of biographical films, I can say I'm definitely not disappointed. It gives you that extra feeling and depth to the movie with its unique soundtrack which has become my one in my bathroom Playlist haha.This movie has made me love Tom McCarthy movies now. It's simply amazing."
" Absolutely stunning film
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,9,"This is a movie that everyone should see, Catholic or not. It illustrates so well the corruption that is endemic to large, powerful bureaucracies. The acting is superb, the story well paced, the reality dealt with perfectly.An extraordinary film."
" Wow
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,9,"This is a riveting story that is directed, written and acted so well. You find yourself leaning towards the screen a lot. This film doesn't try to go over the top as the performances are very subdued but so well done. I highly recommend this film as it has an important subject matter as well."
" The pinnacle of Investigative Journalist filmmaking
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,10,"Taking the #1 spot in the list for my favorite films of the decade, this Best Picture winning film shines a light on the extraordinary investigative journalists who revealed one of the most disturbing true secrets that the church had been hiding for many years.SYNOPSIS:
In 2001, the investigative journalist team, known as ""Spotlight"", for the Boston Globe gets tasked with digging deep into a potential scandal of the American Church keeping secrets and hiding child molesting priests. Though at first believed to be just a couple ""bad apples"", the further the team researched, the more they begin to realize that this unimaginable secret is actually being done on a much grander scale.DIRECTION:
Tom McCarthy really knocks this one out of the park. Every angle is a song and every angle is keeping the right amount of pace while tracking every bit of body language coming off of the phenomenal performances. I've been reviewing many films that aren't asked for an extreme amount of effort on behalf of the directing and I'm compelled to say the same about this film. Despite feeling this way, McCarthy shoots this film in a very particular way where it's hard for me to explain. He is always capturing the right frame at the right moment and whether it's a wide, a medium or a close-up it is particular to a point of perfection. I couldn't imagine the editing nor the direction being any different. I don't want it to be any different. The extreme organization of this film is exquisite and regardless if you're familiar with the true story you're still very much discovering every bit of information along with them. Although I can think of several films of the sort, the only other film I can really compare the meticulous direction with is that of David Fincher's ""Zodiac"" (2007).WRITING:
Every element of this film is damn near flawless for me and the same goes for the writing. As I mentioned in my review of Dark Waters (an also similar film including Mark Ruffalo), when writing a script that is inspired or completely based on true events, you can spot the films that truly do their research. Now, I don't know just how accurate this film is to all of the dialogue that was actually said nor do I know what level of investigation these journalists took on, but anyone can see that this film really dug as deep as it could. A story like this could be scary to tell, especially when it's dealing with an enormous entity like the American Church and so I give the writing and anyone participating in this film in general all of the props in the world.ACTING:
I'm just going to name all of the noteworthy actors: Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liv Schreiber, Brian D'Arcy James, John Slattery, Billy Crudup, Stanley Tucci and Mark Ruffalo. Now there are others who played very small roles who were all spectacular, but for this film I really want to narrow this SPECTACULAR lineup to Stanley Tucci and Mark Ruffalo. Stanley Tucci plays one of the most incredible supporting roles to date. He was so integral to the story and every line of dialogue that came out of his mouth felt so true that I nearly forgot he is an actor and I know that's the job and that's how it's supposed to be, but in every scene that he was in I nearly felt I was watching a straight documentary with the real lawyer. He was unbelievable. Moving on we get to Mark Ruffalo. Without having seen all of his films, I can say without a doubt this is the best performance he has every given. It's one of the greatest performances given period. One could argue the best of the decade. Maybe this story is so close to his heart or maybe he just sparked unreal-like empathy, but I felt as though this story affected him to his very core. The emotion was so raw that the whole movie I wanted this story to get out just so I could see himself get closure. I wouldn't be surprised at all that even though Mr. Hulk has smashed through several Marvel films that this was his most emotionally and mentally draining performance he's every had.CONCLUSION:
All in all, this film goes down as possibly one of my top 10 favorite films of all time. To take a story, entirely filled with dialogue and to keep my interest as much as a Domino's Chocolate Lava Cake, is speaking to significant heights. I can watch this film daily and still be sucked in just as much as the first viewing and the heart wrenching scene between Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo. Simply Impeccable. This is a recommend to absolutely everyone. I am a man of faith and for me to still enjoy this film as much as it does, I believe speak volumes."
" Terrifying what power can do.
",2019-12-06 00:00:00,10,"This film shows what power can do and the layers that must be unearthed to get even a semblance of truth. Incredibly engaging story , horrendous abuse of power and devastation from the Catholic Church."
" The Lesson.
",2019-11-27 00:00:00,9,"Very inspiring. Learnt a lot from the movie. How to work, react and established the reality.
The proactive n intellectual personnel are inspired me."
" Dont hesitate - watch this movie
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,9,I watched this movie for the first time today (Nov 2019) not knowing anything about it except that it was a true story about the Boston Globe uncovering the Catholic church's cover up of Priests abusing children. It was excellent. So interesting. The staff involved at the paper are inspiring. Loved this movie 😊👍👍
" Simple story telling!
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,10,"This is what films are for - the aim is to tell a story. This is a simple, robust telling of an important narrative. Clear, simple, effective.Personally, I thought the costume design was excellent, and choice of setting and portrayal of Boston.Beautiful film and must watch story - important view for everyone. Worthy of its Oscar."
" Fascinating story presented in a genius way.
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,9,This was an incredibly well made and well acted movie about the horrifying true story of child abuse in the Catholic Church. The movie did an incredible job showing the Boston Globe's efforts in handling the story the right way. One of the best dramas/bio-pics I've seen in a long time
" A darring picture
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,10,"It is unique about its cast, storyline and presentation with serious subjects like these are rare and provocative. I have seen this picture more than three times. A very daring subject which has more potential plots that will make you sit at the edge of the seat. Ruffalo was not heated up to become hulk after horrifying things that he investigates in the movie. Such excellent performances from all the cast. Especially Ruffalo."
" One of the great newspaper movies. Anyone wanting to know why journalism is important should watch this
",2019-10-04 00:00:00,9,"All the reviews are great so I want to concentrate on the newspaper and journalistic importance of this movie. How the journalists find a small story then dig and dig until it becomes important at a global level. This movie is on par with ""All the President's men"". Maybe better. In this age of Twitter and Instagram nothing shows why investigative journalism remains as pertinent as ever, I'd not more so than this movie. And it also shows I feel the danger of a decline in a free and diligent press"
" Terrific and Tragic
",2019-08-17 00:00:00,10,"The cast, director, the score..... The list goes on. Every part of this movie is done to perfection, and given the subject matter, it is handled in a very sensible way. Nobody makes excuses and everyone is searching for answers and justice. I flipped by a review of this movie in Empire magazine a while ago, and the rating and star cast caught my eye, but I didn't see it until recently as I had no clue what the reporters were investigating. This movie should be seen by everyone, as the battle to rid the world of this secret society of underground predators rages on. I cannot recommend it enough"

" The struggles, responsibilities and occasional victories of journalism
",2019-08-05 00:00:00,8,"Spotlight centers around eponymous investigative journalism team working for The Boston Globe, which in the early 00s revealed an ongoing campaign of cover-ups by the Catholic Church, aimed to keep the scandal of sexual child abuse conducted by their priests hidden.It is an important moment in history, but where this movie truly shines is in its portrayal of journalism and the role it plays in our society. The movie is told almost purely from the point of view of the journalists. You could exchange the scandal for something else entirely and the movie would play out pretty much unchanged. Its purpose is not to mock or downplay religion, but rather shine a light on the importance of journalism and its capacity to uncover truths. Even those that we've agreed as a society to keep hidden.An important film and an important story, but also a really well-made film as a whole. The acting is topnotch, as is the script. Visually the film is the very opposite of flashy, but this does not in any way hinder the film. Quite the opposite. The subject matter in question demands a serious and solemn approach. It demands the clinical touch of realism. The discussions and the issues have to be on the forefront instead of creative camera movements and elaborate sets.Go watch the film and then at least consider getting a newspaper subscription, so that the journalists of the future can keep doing the good work that they do."
" Gravity of the story, key to the movie success.
",2019-08-01 00:00:00,8,"Spotlight (2015)
This kind of movie probably lives or dies by the power of the story the reporters are trying to tell. In that respect they are unearthing a massive and shocking cover-up by the Catholic Church. It's where this movie and All the Presidents Men succeed and the broadly similar The Post fails.
The performances are hard to comment on other than they are competent and are passive to the story. This isn't about flamboyant characters.
The story itself is well structured and well paced. It's probably 20 minutes too long but then every frame that's left in gives a pathos to the labour of the journalists and so rightfully remains.
There is perhaps no real triumphant ""we got 'em"" moment or crescendo like in (the inferior) The Post as we know it will be written and while damaging it won't exactly shut down the Church.
It could perhaps have dealt with some of the fallout more directly and been more prolonged than a pre credits line about the cardinal but it is the frames after that that cause the biggest intake of breath.
So perhaps because of its gravity. EIGHT"
" Based on a issue occuring worldwide
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,9,"Best one. It's a pathetic issue child abuse is occured by Catholic priests & the issue is tried to be concealed by the Church! In my country child abuse, molesting & rape have become a tremendous issuse now-a-days. Teachers (Even Madrasha Teachers), fathers, brothers, relatives & anyone who got a chance tries to misuse it. We are looking for some steps like this. The film is great in this sense that it has helped to come to light a great issuse happening throughout the world & gives us the message to protest it from one's own position. Great one obviously. Must watch for true story based quality film seekers."
" Brilliant but disturbing
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,10,"Firstly the movie itself is so well made and acted, Mark Ruffalo,Mike Rezendes, Michael Keaton ,Rachel McAdams and Liev Schreiber are all excellent in their respective roles.
The subject is disturbing, but not surprising, the history of the Catholic church is littered with this sort of thing. I recommend the book 'Vicars of Christ' by Peter De Rossa, that shows just how immoral and corrupt the Church sand Popes have been and it seems still are.
Why anyone still attends these Churches baffles me. There may be a few Priests who try to do what's right, but the structure and higher ups are clearly evil."
" Gives me the chills every time
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,10,Very few movies move me anymore. Most are just action or comedy but this is truly an emotional film. It takes an unflinching look at those who told the story of how the Catholic Church ignored and enabled priest that molested children. At the end I always feel a mix of emotions. I've seen this 4 or 5 times now and it still invoked those emotions. I highly recommend this to anyone with an open mind.
" Brilliance in a portrayal of an important story.
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,9,"The way that this film climaxes with thought-provoking dialogue and imagery, it is impeccable. You are left with a heavy conscience and your breath stolen.
The concise nature of this story-telling is a perfect choice for progression and scope. The emotions of the key characters are depicted with a thoughtful interest in the actual events, and all of these emotions can be felt in intense detail."

Excellent writing, direction, and acting."
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,5,"Decent movie, interesting and shocking story, well-made and well-acted. Just not my kind of movie (1 viewing)"
" Awesome!!!!!!!!
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies I've seen on Amazon thus far. I use to live in New York City and I would hear about all of this going on but I never believed it was true on till I saw this movie on Amazon, to thing that this movie is based on true events. It's so appalling to hear what so many children went through. Thank goodness that this was discovered and all these priest was brought to justice!!!! I solute Amazon for putting this movie on prime and giving us the viewers a small view of what went on."
" Filmmaking worthy and respectful of its subject matter
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,8,It's powerful to be reminded of the importance of the free press by thoughtful storytelling and fine acting. That is exactly what happens here.
" Spotlight: My Good, Bad, and Ugly
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,9,"The Good:
Spotlight excellently sets the stage for the shocking stories that the quartet of Boston Globe reporters sometimes seem only to stumble into. As the film unfolds, the world around them foreshadows both the giant revelations that they uncover, and the sweeping network of moral horrors perpetrated by The Catholic Church in Boston. A character goes so far even to point out a church, and playground, in the background as he tells the story of his repeated molestations as a child and how that further confused his already delicate sense of sexuality. In that moment, while unnecessarily obvious, The Church's stranglehold of a city and its people is made clear so in every other sequence the hidden symbolism of the same becomes more ominous and slowly bubbles to the surface as the moment of The Globe's publication approaches.The Bad:
The film is unnecessarily preachy at times. Each principal actor is given a moment where they expound on the grave moral compromises made by those involved both inside and outside the Church. The film assumes an audience that's unaware of the controversy that The Boston Globe helped to uncover, or that has already sided with the film's antagonist. To combat the naïveté or predeterminations of that assumed audience the film gives us lapsed Catholics outraged as they realize the scope of what the priests of their community have been doing for decades. The outrage on its own is to be expected given the subject matter, but when the script explicitly calls attention to it, it does a disservice to its audience by not allowing it to come to those same conclusions naturally through the investigations and exposés built into the narrative.The Ugly:
Spotlight superbly re-introduces the potential of journalism ride-along films. A genre best introduced by All the President's Men (Alan J. Pakula, 1976). Like Spotlight, Pakula's film elaborates on a recent controversy by chronicling the actions of investigative journalists and their editors that stumble upon the greatest contemporary scandal of modern America. Rather than telling the story of Watergate and the ensuing scandal, the audience uncovers the truth through an interrogation of the facts much like Woodward and Bernstein did throughout 1972 and 1973. Most significantly this film does the job of retelling the investigative uncovering of a major scandal better than its 2015 counterpart chiefly by refraining from any opinionated commentary. The audience of the day understood the gravity of the scandal having experienced it in real-time only three years prior - much like Spotlight - and the filmmakers understood their responsibility to present a narrative grounded in the truth without a diegetic commentary that would push an individual interpretation one way or another regarding the consequences of Watergate."
" Some moves are more important than others.
",2019-05-17 00:00:00,8,"Some moves are more important than others. The people who should watch this, won't and the people who understand the hideousness of the crimes perpetuated by the vile people protected by religion, will. There are a few movies that everyone should watch and this movie is meta in itself in that it is a piece of investigative journalism, about investigative journalism. Long may movies of this calibre, exposing the lowest of the low and the people who protect them."
" fantastic
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,9,"What a film this is, essentially 90% of the plot boils down to journalists having meetings and doing research yet it's so well put together you're completely gripped from the first frame. Everything in this film works, the performance across the board are excellent, the direction, the soundtrack, all perfect. Actors you've seen in other films and never even left a mark all get it pitch perfect here. I haven't seen another McCarthy film but I'll rectify that because this is first class film-making it really is. The story is sickening and heartbreaking in equal measure, no-one gets out of this film without being examined thoroughly, it's a triumph."
" A Great Cast Telling An Important Story The Right Way. Bold & Unsmypathetic.
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,7,"Not much should be written by movie reviewers with free IMDB accounts about this subject, so I will simply say that willful ignorance is a moral sin, and can even be considered criminal in the United States. So, to refuse watching a film because it might challenge other members of your faith or denomination defeats the purpose of moral maintenance in church each week.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

" Superb Movie, Watch With Caution if you have been affected by the events in the story, quite a hard watch
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,9,"The casting of this is so good, the subject matter, maybe not something you would think makes a good movie. But these reporters are out to set things straight, their new boss comes in and insists it's an essential story to the Boston Globes readers. And so it proves to be. A very important moment in history, what the church was covering up may shock you, but what the globe uncovered (eventually), lead to help for victims, and a closer eye and no more church cover ups. I didn't think I'd enjoy this, it's now in my top 10"
" Good acting. Well made.
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,8,Perfectly executed praise of the power of the press. A stellar cast and flawless direction make for an engaging and highly entertaining result. It doesn't even take major shockers to make this such a satisfying and smart movie.
" Kick arse!

" Spotlight is carried by an excellent representation
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,9,"Spotlight is a very interesting and important film to see. Not like a typical Oscar-Bait movie. Real life based drama that take over the world. Interesting from the beginning to the end, at the end of the movie you either feel indignation or fully accomplished with the main characters."
" Make you concious of the reality which happens around us.
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,9,"Spotlight, the real life based drama that take over the world on the 2015, interesting from the beginning to the end, at the end of the movie you either feel indignation or fully accomplished with the main characters."
" One of my best
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,9,"One of the most rewarding slow burners of the past century. Spotlight heavily utilizes its real life story to perfection, as it addressed the reveal of a shocking secret kept under wrap for years. Tom McCarthy did a phenomenal job directing the picture, orchestrating a conclusion we've been anxiously waiting for. The performances were also terrific, just like its Oscar-worthy screenplay. Its a very human movie that everyone could get to know about and see."
" Slow but interesting
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,8,"It's not flashy, but still an incredibly effective piece of advertising. You know in an instant that this is a journalism movie; die-hards in rolled-up shirtsleeves working all hours to unearth a national scandal. I am big time fan of this movie.Its slow but very interesting"
" Serious acting for an equally serious topic
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,8,"Spotlight is a dark insight into the secrets of the Catholic church in the USA, and does not hold back on any punches. The revelations uncovered throughout the film (and the actions of the church following) are like something fictional, making the topic even more startling. By experiencing it from the viewpoint of the media, it becomes even more apparent the lengths to which some senior members of the church went to avoid publicity - as well as the influence religion still has on modern-day society.Strong casting helps to emphasise the story: Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams (among others) all portray their characters brilliantly, hailing them as the heroes that uncovered the priest scandal of the early 2000s. Spotlight is not an easy watch, but navigates a difficult plot well by giving a glimpse of justice; however, even after watching, you will be left with an uneasy feeling that is hard to shake."
" Powerhouse Drama
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,8,"Great story, great acting, great execution. What else can you ask for in a movie? I can't really identify anything I didn't like about it. Rarely do I give a movie a 9 or a 10. I have to really connect with the people and subject matter for a rating like that. I'm not that in to media and cover ups and stuff like that, but this was just fantastic. 8 out of 10 is a very high rating in my book. If you missed this understated powerhouse drama in 2015, do yourself a favor and check it out. You'll be glad you did."

",2019-04-05 00:00:00,9,"Great Acting, great direction, great story, great screenplay. Well-deserved motion picture of the year, transfers you to America's late 90's and early 2000's. An absolutely necessary movie to watch, and what a great job is done making this movie. I feel there is not enough emphasize on what an incredibly perfect movie this is. Easily, it can be put among the best-ever-made movies.
The only reason I didn't gave a full score was the fact that I have seen better movies, maybe lack of score and music as great as the movie itself, that's all.The way Tom McCarthy tells the story of a team of journalists shedding light on of the most controversial topics of the world is, in one word, brilliant. The scenes are perfectly juxtaposed. No surprises in this movie, just pure shock! If there's a bit of humanity in you, you'll be blown away watching this story.
With regard to production, 6-Oscar nominee has done a great deal of work, creating tangible atmosphere. No unnecessary scenes in this movie. Everything is fit!Acting as I've mentioned before, is just how I love it: realistic, bold and adequate. What performances by Marc Ruffalo, and Rachel McAdams. I've always thought of these two as OK actors, but, they have shown a vastly higher class of acting in this one. Micheal Keaton, is as good as ever, and Liev Schrieber plays a very different character than his Ray Donovan, yet as strong and bold. And can we applaud the most underrated actor in this movie:
Brian d'Arcy James
I am mesmerized by his performance, yet he didn't receive the attention he deserved.Please watch this movie and be shocked by it. Then, really think about what it's trying to tell you. And, then, you'll realize how important this movie is."
" journalism done right
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,10,Powerful recreation of a historical low point in the USA Catholic Church
" A Fascinating and Shocking Look into the Reporting of Horrific Events
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,9,"After I had watched this movie, I immediately understood why this was chosen as Best Picture. Beside the favouritism for relevant real-life stories at the Academy, this movie was actually meticulously written and acted, and still has a lasting impact on me today. I also regard it as one of the best crafted movies of 2015.Acting:
Michael Keaton as ""Robbie"" Robertson gives a subtle and very realistic performance as the self-proclaimed coach of the Spotlight team. He is so good that what he does can actually easily be overlooked: simply portraying a real and humble reporter who gets things done and is not afraid to ask harsh things when needed. Besides that he is very charismatic and quite funny occasionally, and a strong force of acting in this ensemble.Mark Ruffalo as Mike Rezendes is the definition of what a more cynical person would describe as an oscar-bait actor. Ruffalo throws everything he has all at once into this performance: an excentric, passionate and nosy reporter with a lot of energy and work ethic. He nails every mannerism and quirky aspect, and gives by far the best performance in the entire movie, definitely deserving the oscar nomination.Rachel McAdams as Sacha Pfeiffer is by far the most leavel-headed and empathetic of the team, exuding warmth and compassion, yet also determination and efficiency when it comes to her job. McAdams gives a strong and realistic performance, and while not as good as Keaton and Ruffalo, she is still a force to be reckoned with.Liev Schreiber as Marty Baron has a more plot-driven role. As an introvert yet warm new editor at the Globe, he does the best he can to steer everyone in the right direction, and is the first to suggest to tackle the scandal. Schreiber gives a good and realistic performance. but no more than servicable instead of really giving much dept.Stanley Tucci as Mitch Garabedian is another highlight. He plays a strict and no-nonsense attorney in Boston, as one of the first people who decided to take major action against the church. Tucci gives an excellent performance, providing a surprising amount of likability to the harsh and mistrusting man.The rest of the cast consists mostly of people being questioned/grilled by the Spotlight team, and most of them are doing great considering the little amount of time they get. Their scenes provide most of the emotional core of the story, and that is a testament to how well they do their job.Direction:
Tom McCarthy chose to go for an efficient yet humane approach to this heavy and dense subject, providing a lot of exposition-filled scenes with grounding aspects and strong emotion. This firm grip is noticable throughout most of the movie, and works incredibly well. His work with actors is nothing short of excellent.Cinematography:
Nothing really special, but you feel pretty quick as though you are searching to dozens of papers and computer files with the rest of the team thanks to the color pallet of grey and brown. It reflects the atmosphere of a work-space and an office building, and aids into respecting the tremendous amount of work that the Spotlight team has done.Plot:
It is not easy to hassle so many names and dates cohesively into a movie and portraying the extend of the scandal accurately at the same time. McCarthy and Josh Singer passed with flying colors: while careful attention is needed most of the time to memorize the right names, everything fits carefully into place as the runtime goes on, and by the end all the relevations are so shocking and disgusting that you feel just like the reporters at that moment.Music:
Coming from the man who composed the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, this is a whole step back in regards to complexity. It works however, and the simple piano tunes evoke a sadness and emptiness that quite well portrays the shock how this all could go on for years unpunished.Editing:
Just like the cinematography, nothing special, but it does the job. All the events feel very streamlined and efficiently put together, avoiding the danger of this movie becoming stale and dragging. That is quality editing.Production Design:
The interior of the globe and the homes of Boston feel real and lived in, without seemingly much effort. You could walk right in and never notice that a movie would be shot here in a few minutes. The best design is paradoxically the one that doesn't draw your attention.Tone:
While a lot of the time it can feel dry and heavy due to the enormous amount of information and characters, the actors and emotional story-threads help a lot to give the necessary humanity and feelings that come with such a shocking scandal. By the third act, you are simply filled with disgust and grief.Overal Consensus:
With the aid of a great cast, writing and subject material, this is a movie that needs to be seen and remembered, especially since the scandal is far from over more than 15 years later. 8.5/10"
" An excellent film that asks the hard questions of the status quo.
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,10,"For many years, the running joke about the movies that have won the Best Picture Oscar is that they only won because another film should have won years prior. Spotlight (2015) is this generation's All the President's Men (1976) in that it is an excellent film about investigative journalism that broke open a huge cover-up, changing the world forever. Both films deserved to be Best Picture, but Spotlight manages to take an uncomfortable subject and be frank and open about the problems that we still see in today's society.Since most of the movie is comprised of uncovering the truth behind the sexual abuse scandals in the Catholic Church, it's surprising how gripping and well-paced the film ends up being. Part of the genius of this film is the high-energy dedication these four journalists have in uncovering the terrifying truths that had been lurking in the shadows for decades. While such a subject could easily create a bias, this film manages to take an almost unbiased approach in its search for the depth of the problem that most people would ignore to keep the status quo. The tension created with each subsequent twist and turn of the investigation keeps the audience wondering how much further the corruption can go.The impact of Spotlight deserves to be recognized, which is why I am glad that it won Best Picture for 2015. While intrinsically simple, this film delivers a powerful, emotional punch without relying on hackneyed methods to pull at the heartstrings of its viewers. Upon a second viewing a few years later, I was able to notice more of the menacing subtlety of the churches and cathedrals placed conveniently near playgrounds, schools, and other child-friendly zones. That is the brilliance of this movie: knowing the threat, but also knowing how many people are unaware of it.An excellent film that asks the hard questions of the status quo, I give Spotlight 5.0 stars out of 5."
" good lord
",2019-03-05 00:00:00,10,I lived thru all this and remember going to the library to read a copy of the boston paper when they were reporting it ... this movie captures the kick in the gut that this news was ... and I still wonder how the catholic church is still 'In business'
" Powered by an exceptional screenplay
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,10,"I have watched this film 3 times and each time I am in awe at how finely tuned the screenplay is in terms of both the issues and the storytelling. The script, for example, both demonstrates the power of the media while bluntly criticizing the Globe for not putting the pieces together sooner. It makes the characters not saints but people who did their job well and did a service for the community. Likewise, by including a spectrum of reactions among Catholics (lapsed I some cases) the film manages to criticizes the Catholic hierarchy without criticizing the Catholic faith. The accounts of the victims contain enough detail to bring into focus the awfulness of sexual assault without being obscene or sensationalist.But best of all, each scene feels included for the sake of the story. So, for example, when Mike blows up and gives voice to feeling betrayed it is both to give voice to that sort of reaction and a natural outgrowth of Mike's character. It explains why he had been such a workaholic on this story. Nothing feels included to shape the societal points and yet the more you look at the information presented a hell of lot of societal points are made. The script is one of the best ever written.Fortunately, the masterful script is brought to life by a great cast and simply but effective direction. This is truly a great film."
" Worthwhile for how it's enlightening, definitely
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,9,"When watching this non-fiction film I didn't exactly think at any point ""Okay what could this movie have done better...""
The acting by everyone is completely realistic, and pacing of the plot seemed flawless.
....And ""flawless"" doesn't mean ""outstanding"", it just means I didn't think about it when watching.
Spotlight is quite the worthwhile documentarian film, given simply the quality of acting, lack of any quirks that distract from the story, and the importance of the scandals it focuses on.
Not the kind of movie I would think to judge using typical, is-it-entertaining film standards."
" Independent Press vs Influential Institutions
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,8,"A mainstream Boston newspaper runs an expose of an alleged institutionalized cover up of the Church intended to keep a shroud of secrecy over an scheme engineered to hide the misconduct of Priests who sexually abused Children in the 70-80s. The movie intends to show how the journalists did the research and the hurdles popping up along the way. It is based on true events. The plot is managed properly without any excesses, based on concrete facts and with a testimonial outlook."
" Hulk!
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,9,"I wish that the role of Hulk in this film also turned into Hulk, and would eliminate all the prophets of all false religions."
" Deserving of All the Awards
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,8,"Spotlight is such an important and powerful film. This is the story of a team of Boston Globe journalists who discovered how the church was hiding many pedophile priests giving them no real punishments. This film won Best Picture about three years ago and it totally deserved it. What makes this movie so great is that it decided to showcase the complete journalism process, the way we start to see our four reporters start to uncover the truth is amazing. It's not about the drama or the personal struggles of a particular character, it's about how a journalist does his or her job, and why it's important. Apart from that, it doesn't shy away from the subject matter of pedophiles. On one particular scene Sacha, the character amazingly played by Rachel McAdams, says: ""Language is going to be really important here. The word 'molest' isn't going to be enough"". And that's totally it, we get the hard and difficult truth of the actual events that happened with no sugarcoating.
The overall look and tone of the film was beautiful, there are a couple shots that took my breath away. And this top level of filmmaking complements the top level acting from the whole ensemble.
This movie is so real it actually terrifies me about the situation they uncovered. It's the truth, which can be really hard and disturbing, but it's the whole truth."
" The power of the press!
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,9,"Spotlight is mindblowing film that deserves all of the accolades it has received. There is something special about a film like Spotlight, that hits on both a cinematic and real world level. This is a film that will challenge the viewer, and hopefully inspire the viewer long after the movie has finished. In an age of ""fake news"", it is important to remind ourselves of the purpose and the impact of investigative journalism."
" Abjure Nothingness
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,6,"Even though this is a critically acclaim movie, I found that it doesn't have much to offer in the side of the story, besides that it's well shot and decently acted. But the movie really goes nowhere."
" A well-made and heartbreaking film
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,8,"Spotlight is a well-made and heartbreaking film. The actors, Mark Ruffalo in particular, do a great job of expressing the range of emotions required for such a sensitive topic and the story, though hard to watch, is absolutely compelling. I'm not bothered that this won Best Picture."
" Such a breathtaking film.
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,9,"The movie ""Spotlight,"" was a film about a massive sexual child abuse perpetrated by hundreds of priests of the Catholic Church. The main character of the film was Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Michael Keaton, and Brian d'Arcy James. They go on a journey of finding out the horrible truth about the priests of the Catholic Church.Spotlight was a group of four journalists named Mike, Walter, Sacha, and Matt. The four of them worked together to investigate, gather information, and were able to get their hands on sensitive records that were sealed to the public. As Spotlight continue to investigate, they come to find out that the Catholic Church were making settlements with the victims of sexual abuse to keep them from ever saying anything to the public. They then found out that a log was kept with the name of all the priests, and each time a priest committed sexual abuse it was written in the log with the excuse that they were absent due to illness. This was a simple act of covering up. At the end Mike was able to get a hold of the public record which reveal all the cases and hundred of priests involved. The law officials have known about these cases for many years and did nothing to stop it from ever happing again.There were a few film techniques used in this film to bring out the story of these priests. I felt like the film focused more on the information rather than the characters. One of the techniques that I recognize in the film ""Spotlight,"" was the camera movement. In one of the scenes, Matt finds out that one of the accused priest lives close by. The camera follows him from behind as he runs up to the house where the priest lived and then slowly zooms up to Matt face. The scene was intense because it should how Matt was shocked but at the same time also wanting to protect his kids from the priest. Another example of a film technique used is the lighting of the film. I felt like throughout the film the lighting was neutral and, in a way, it almost felt like a documentary. I think the filmmaker wanted its audience to focus more on the details provided rather than the quality of the film.One film that is similar to ""Spotlight"" is ""Citizen Kane."" These two films are similar because they are about journalists going about finding out the truth of the matter. In both films, the authors focused more on the information that was found by the journalist and what it revealed and the facts before publishing it to the public.In conclusion, I enjoy watching ""Spotlight."" It was an eye-opening to know what was
going on and how many families were affected by this all. The director of ""Spotlight"" did a great job of telling the story and the truth about it. This film was a story that many of the Catholic Church didn't think will ever come out and the filmmaker did a great job at putting its focuses on revealing the truth."
" SPOTLIGHT the movie of the year in two thousand and fifteen.
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,10,SPOTLIGHT has a varied cast of celebrities with academic nominees because of our knowledge of their unity in the film universe meaning movies. SPOTLIGHT which seemed like a real scoop about a case of child molesters is beyond our understanding as we are not 'excommunicated' from our schools.
" the catholic church is held responsible
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because it shows you that if people are willing to talk the power of silence is broken. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Loved it!
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,10,Loved the movie. It raised serious issues within the catholic church. Very intense. Highly recommend.
" A gripping, tight drama with a consistent but simple perspective
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,7,"Spotlight is a satisfying, very consistent movie. The ensemble cast is great, and the direction is tight and clean. The story is a very important one and the unfolding of the layers of the scandal was hard to believe. I would've liked a consideration of more perspectives, as it was just from the Globe's perspective and didn't really get into the conflict they dealt with, just the straightforward pursuit of information and proof. The pacing was also a bit strange, with lots of build and then an oddly rushed third act that made it feel like there wasn't really a climax. It's a well-done and gripping movie, but the single perspective and imperfect third act keep Spotlight from being a great movie."
" Overrated..
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,3,Maybe i didn't understand the movie but was bored to hell by this
" Spotlight: Exposing the Truth
",2018-10-23 00:00:00,9,"Journalists primarily exist behind their keyboards. They poke holes in politician's lies, expose corruption, and in 2001, the Catholic Church's child molestation cover ups. Spotlight shakes the viewer to his core, providing an edge of your seat retelling of the Boston Globe investigative journalists who defied all odds to bring the truth to light. The cast is littered with powerful actors including Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, and Liev Schreiber. Keaton plays the internally conflicted Spotlight team leader ""Robby"" Robinson. Director Tom McCarthy has a troubled past artistically. But he proves his merit with Spotlight, casting aside all previous blunders like 2012. Tom McCarthy not only directed, but he wrote the original screenplay alongside Josh Singer. Spotlight's dialogue is clever and slightly combative. The story alone slowly burns and delivers a payoff worthy its Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.From a strict entertainment perspective, Spotlight hits the mark. It accomplishes this without using pulpy details or flashbacks to the crimes Catholic priests had committed. It instead invites you to feel the psychological pain endured by the now adult victims. There truly is nothing I can suggest to the creative team. If anything, I wished it were even longer so that I could savor the catharsis."
" A story needed to be told, told well
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,10,"This is an award winning story about what it takes to put together an award winning newspaper story that just happens to be true. 
I am so very glad this movie was made, am so very sorry for the many victims of predators and so very horrified and angry that I didn't fully appreciate the extent of the crimes against children & adults and how extensively and successfully they were covered up.
Every Catholic should watch this movie to understand what has happened and what yet needs to be done..
Every reporter should watch this movie to learn that they need. To investigate.
Everyone needs to watch this movie to know why we must all be vigilant because it is not just the Catholic Church but every church, scout hall, school, courtroom, police station.... anywhere a predator hides."
" A Brave Story
",2018-09-21 00:00:00,9,"It is really a good story and playing. The only thing I found odd is that Chief Editor of the newspaper was selected as a Jewish. It might be a true story but gives a feeling of that the Chief Editor acted bravely on the story because he is from a different religion. And it might annoy people's feeling especially the Catholics. The problem of molestings, harressing and raping of needy, poor and unprotected kids are so common in all types of such so called 'religiously institutions' all around the word. Hope all religions and sects will wipe out such 'religious figures' no matter where it reaches. By the way, it is a great sin and make kids to lose their enthuiasm for the religion when they are trapped or witnessed such inhumane treatment in so called religious places. Great story and examplary journalism."
" Deserved the Oscar
",2018-09-20 00:00:00,8,"Well acted drama about a disturbing but important subject matter, which has affected people all over the world.All the main cast are excellent but Mark Ruffalo in particular stood out with his performance"
" Spot the Light Difference.
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,7,"The subject matter, as well as Ruffalo and Schrieber's performances in particular, together with the rest of the cast is arguably a 10/10, however, a film also comes with more than just actors and plot.Spotlight has an excellent, and a HIGHLY necessary story that needs to be told as much as humanly possible, but, how it was told wasn't at all revolutionary or profound in fact. The story is profound, but the telling of it is not. Spot that light and faint difference.McCarthy's direction was pretty much as ordinary as they come, barring one very piercing scene however, that was just so incredibly subtle, but if noticed, just commanded absolute attention.Also, Shore's score was unreservedly appropriate for this film. It set the necessary tone from the very beginning.Because of its subject matter, Spotlight should get a 10/10, however at the end of the day, it is a piece of art, and should be viewed as such. Its message is amazing, and had it been told better, then this film could've been among the greatest of all time. 7/10."
" A film that transcends cinematic entertainment.
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,9,"This film is much more than just a story and more than just an unwinding tale for entertainment- it is a slow build to fully showcase the atrocities that have occurred at the hands of one of the most popular religions in the world. This film will and should shake you to the core. Only a film can utilize people to convey the emotions that are so natural after discovering the information presented and this film does so exquisitely. Watch this film if the discovery of mankind's filth is something you feel you have to do. It is the duty of all who can speak and all who are righteous, to hear the stories of humanity's horrors."
" Terrific.
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,9,This movie tells you no matter how hard the conditions are. You should always do what you believe in. The editor being from another religion dared show the real face of self acclaimed GODMEN and false supremacy of Church. A masterpiece.
" Defrocking the priest
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,7,"I have a friend who is a devout Catholic who likes to tell people how historically the Catholic priesthood had always traditionally attracted homosexuals. All these men, allegedly celibate who all lived together.Spotlight based on true events is how the Boston Globe newspaper stumbled on a story of abusive priests in Boston and how they were protected by the top Cardinal in Boston. Cardinal Law would had the victims paid off and then moved them around so they would live to abuse another day.The Spotlight team of the Globe are requested by their new editor to investigate and their diligence pays off. They uncover a horde of abusive priests who damaged generations of children.Director Tom McCarthy aimed to make a modern version of All the President's Men. They even have a Ben Bradley but it is junior the son of the great editor of The Washington Post. McCarthy treats the film as a procedural. It starts off as a weak story, most of the journalists are not interested in investigating the Catholic church that still has a big foothold in Boston.However as the team probes they uncover more layers, more victims, more deviant priests and the newspapers own failings. Several people tell the journalists that information and documents was sent to them in the past and they did nothing.The film benefits from the acting of its ensemble cast ranging from Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo to Billy Crudup. Liev Schreiber is very restrained here, unusually for a newspaper editor bought in to shake things up. Ruffalo has the more showy role. It is not a greatly photographed film, there are several nice shots but it really comes across as a lower budget film."
" Not The Best Movie of 2015
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,6,"This won the Best Film at the Oscars 2016 over The Revenant, The Big Short, and Mad Max: Fury Road. That got me interested because I loved every one of those movies that year. ""Man this has to be a great movie if it won over the movie that Leo finally got his Oscar in,"" I thought to myself as I selected it from Netflix.Spotlight follows the story of the Boston Globe special reporting team of the same name as they uncover child molestation and abuse in the catholic church. The story itself is really an interesting story. The pacing of the movie is fluid and it never bored me. Every time there was a break in the case, a rush of excitement hit me. I'm glad they didn't focus too much time on 9/11, as I was afraid it would just kill all the momentum it had been rolling up the whole way. The performances of everyone, especially Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton, were great. Liev Schreiber was a commanding presence in the movie as well, with his quiet, but almost intimidating role as the main editor.But other than the great acting and an interesting plot, nothing really is special about the movie. The movie is boring to just look at visually. No colors stand out in a wash of grey, white, and black. I get that maybe it's because duh newspaper, but it is not a movie for spectacle. The camera work was really boring as well. No interesting shots or composition were to be seen in the whole film. I watched it maybe 3 days ago and I can't, for the life of me, remember any scene vividly. Nothing was noteworthy of my memory.It's an interesting story, an important story, but shot in the most boring and drab way. It has a lot to say with great acting, but it just failed to really wow me."
" Deserved to win Best Picture
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,9,"Spotlight is a well-made film. It even contains one of my favorite actors, John Slattery of Madmen fame. He was perfectly cast for this film, since he was a native Bostoner. The issue of the Catholic Church consistently and constantly covering up child abuse by priests has been with us since the first Catholic school was established in the US. I went to a Catholic elementary school, and our priests were as clean as a whistle. But a lot of other schools and priests were not. That is why this film is so important. Keaton has more recent success (in addition to Birdman) and now his career is completely back on track. Highly Recommended"
" A Courageous Film
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,7,"Based on a true story: In the early 2000s, a team of reporters at the Boston Globe investigate several incidents of Catholic priests sexually abusing children.""Spotlight"" works well on many levels and not just for its main story of finding the shocking facts. It also reveals that universal and timeless evil known as the 'conspiracy of silence' that occurs within establishments. In this particular story, the conspiracy is not only within the Catholic Church but also within the upper echelons of Boston society. Another fact of human nature is also revealed: in any closed society, it often takes outsiders to make necessary changes.The film also sheds light on a group of people rarely exposed in movies: lapsed Catholics i.e. those raised in the religion but who became discouraged by grave misconduct at higher levels of the church hierarchy. It turns out that all of the reporters are in this situation and there is a fascinating scene in which they discuss their backgrounds and how this might affect their approach to their investigation.The first half is filled with energy with much inter-cutting among scenes. The highlight is a cross-cut of two scenes involving interviews with abuse survivors - one straight, one gay. In these scenes, the language is refreshingly blunt and revealing. A later scene involving an interview with a priest is even more shocking. The actors playing the survivors and the priest are also powerful in their brief roles.The second half is still good but it tends to lag a bit. It seems like time to wrap up but more issues keep getting piled on. One is a scene involving a conflict on the newspaper team. The benefit of this scene is that it shows the best of Mark Ruffalo who gives the most passionate performance among a very fine cast. The downside is that the scene feels like an unnecessary extension to the movie.This movie is rightly being compared to ""All the President's Men"" as a great journalist story. It can also be compared to the superb Canadian film ""The Boys of St. Vincent"" (1992) for exposing clergy child abuse. ""Spotlight"" is a fine film that may not meet all expectations; but it must be given credit for its courage and boldness."
" A Powerful Story That Will Anger Those Who Watch It
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,10,"This is a difficult movie to watch - a movie that will make you truly angry, even if you aren't Catholic. It details the work of a group of investigative reporters with the Boston Globe in the late 1990's and early 2000's to expose the sexual abuse scandals of the Roman Catholic Church in Boston. Now, today, we hear so much about the sexual abuse of minors by priests that I fear we've become hardened to it. It doesn't seem to shock us anymore. But at that time most of this was unknown to most people - covered up by Church officials who just kept moving pedophile priests from parish to parish and settling with abuse victims out of court to protect the image of the church; used by lawyers who presumably made a comfortable living off the negotiated settlements; swept under the carpet by officials ranging from police officers to judges who turned their eyes away because they were Catholic themselves; ignored or minimized by the media when stories did leak out. It's a story about an out of control institution and the power of the Roman Catholic Church - not a wild eyed conspiracy type of story, but a raw, down to earth story about what was (and is) essentially a conspiracy to try to get the Church off the hook for the abuse committed by its clergy. This is a powerful story that makes you shake your head in disgust and contempt.The movie opens with a brief account of an abused boy in 1976, and a visit by Cardinal Bernard Law to his family to work something out so that nothing goes public. So we're exposed right away to the fact that the Church cared more about itself and its reputation than about its victims. Then we jump into the story of the journalistic investigation. The strong suggestion of the movie is that none of this might have come out except for the fact that in early 2001 the Globe hired a new editor - Marty Baron (played by Liev Schrieber.) Baron was not from Boston. Baron was not Catholic. Baron was not Christian - he was Jewish. Basically, he had no stake in covering this up and so he demanded that his investigative team plow ahead with its work, with the goal being not just to find individual cases of abuse but to find out what the systemic problem was and how far up the hierarchy it went. Michael Keaton played the head of the ""Spotlight"" team - a team of Globe reporters who work solely on investigative journalism - ably supported by Mark Ruffalo, Brian D'Arcy James and Rachel McAdams as the team. The performances were superb, but this movie really isn't about the performances. It's about the story itself. You really didn't need well known names for this - the story drives the movie forward, as the scandal grows and grows - cover up after cover up. From a handful of priests involved to 13, to 90 all the way up the hierarchy of the archdiocese itself until it finally reaches the door of Cardinal Law himself (played by Len Cariou.) Many of the victims are found and interviewed. Some of their stories, while not incredibly graphic, are still sickening. And the movie ends with a huge list of places in the United States and around the world where sex abuse scandals have hit the Roman Catholic Church.The story proceeds both slowly and deliberately - and provides a fair bit of detail into the investigation. In that sense it's also an interesting look at investigative journalism. But in the end it leaves you angry. I am a Christian and I am clergy - not Roman Catholic but Protestant and married with a daughter, but this still hits home even if I'm not part of that tradition. It is horrifying and outrageous. The abuse of the trust that parents placed in these priests only to have that trust abused in the worst possible way is shocking. I firmly believe that the vast majority of Roman Catholic priests are fine and faithful men who do not and would never abuse children. And the problem of abuse of trust is not restricted to the Roman Catholic Church by any means. But this story and the many, many scandals that have erupted since do point to a systemic problem in the Roman Catholic Church that seems to be out of control, and a larger than would be expected number of pedophiles within the priesthood.It is truly difficult to find anything much to criticize about this. It's a first rate, well done movie that sadly remains entirely relevant and will probably remain relevant for some time to come. (10/10)"
" Best Picture; Really?
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,5,"(Flash Review)OK so yes, this is an important and impactful story. No denying that. Does simply making a film about it warrant winning best picture? As I look at it from a cinematic angle, it is rather run of the mill and doesn't seem to take advantage or be inspired by the medium of film. Sure, the acting is solid but the film doesn't make following reporters covering the story or even the couple of in depth interviews feel very engrossing. Most of the drama comes from reporters arriving minutes after closing time and being frustrated. If the story really isn't visually dynamic then make the cinematography more intriguing to compliment certain plot points or emotional moments to make them more impactful. There is better cinematography on Law & Order. This is far from comparable to All the President's Men as many have compared it to. See it if you need to check off watching all the best picture winners."
" An Exceptional Film
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,10,"This film is brilliant by its staging, the scenario and the performance of the actors.
The serious subject of this film is subtly treated. 
A story that deserved to be brought to the screen"
" An Epic really powerful film
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,10,"This film won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2016 and I have been told to watch Spotlight ever since and I have now had the chance to do this and this is truly one of the best and one of the most important films I have ever seen. The premise of this film sees a group of Boston reporters looking into possible misdoings from priests at the Catholic Church. The main star in this film is that of Mark Ruffalo and this is probably the best I have ever seen him, he sinks his teeth into this role and you can really believe that he is a journalist. It's also fascinating seeing his characters journey throughout the film and you just want to root for him all the way through. The rest of the cast is amazing too, Michael Keaton plays the head of the team and he continues his career renaissance by delivering a great performance full of depth and intrigue. Rachel McAdams is a great actress and she totally nails it in this film, her character has a good story in the film and it's great to see her given as important a role in this film as the male reporters in the story. Liev Schreiber is known for playing very powerful physical performances but he plays the new head of the globe and he gave a truly unique great performance that I wasn't sure that he was capable of. Other great performances come from Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, John Slattery and Jamey Sheridan who add so much to their smaller roles and really gave this film an overall sense of realism. The story of this film is so interesting with this group of journalists going on a hunt for this story. It deals with a ton of sensitive and important moments but it kept me interested and intrigued throughout. The script deals with its dramatic dialogue very respectfully and appropriately which makes it comes across as quite naturally. Also the little bits of humour made these characters feel like real people and not just characters that are in a movie. The style of the film is so tense and on edge that you don't know what the next twist is going to be and it always keeps you on your toes. Overall this is truly a special film that I feel should be seen by everybody to truly appreciate what films are about."
" If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to abuse one.
",2018-08-02 00:00:00,10,"There are two films to see if you are studying to be a journalist. Spotlight is one and then there is ""All The Presidents' Men"" about the abuse of power in the highest offices. Spotlight recounts how the Boston Globe uncovered not only the abuse but the massive cover-up to the Cardinal to protect their pedophile priests which became the first story in a worldwide scandal about abusive priests. We are now hearing about nuns being abused by priests. As a lifelong Catholic, I was fortunate that I wasn't a victim of such abuse. This film isn't about the abuse although horrible and massive to have thousands of survivors come forward but it is about the institution of the Catholic Church who abused their power in failing to protect vulnerable, innocent children from such horrific abuse. I know that the Catholic Church is not infallible. They are at fault for allowing such heinous but crimes but they are not alone. There are other religious organizations who have survivors coming forward about their own abuse. I hope that they don't stop coming forward. Boston was a heavily Catholic city with a strong Catholic influence in its politics and history. Boston was the hometown of the Kennedys and other Irish Catholics. The Catholic Church's power was finally brought down by a newspaper named the Boston Globe who I pray never goes out of business. This is why the press is so important. The cast was first rate and the film won the Best Picture Academy Award."
" Which story do you want us to write...because we are writing one of them...
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,9,"In 2001, The Boston Globe worked to provide proof regarding the cover-up of sexual abuse within the Roman Catholic Church. Editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) assigned the team of journalists to investigate the allegations against the priests for molesting boys. Editor Robby (Michael Keaton), reporters Michael (Mark Ruffalo), Matty (Brian d'Arcy James) and Sacha (Rachel McAdams) interview the victims and try to obtain the documents from the court. This team at The Boston Globe were referred to as Spotlight. The movie Spotlight is a drama/crime film based on a true story.This film really brings to light what went on in the Roman Catholic Church and still goes on today. It is shocking how the Church could have the power to keep this a secret. It's even more surprising that government officials and attorneys have been controlled by the church to turn a blind eye. It's heartbreaking how so many families with children were affected.All the actors did a great job in this film. They each brought something unique to their characters that brought them together as a great team for The Boston Globe. One of my favorite lines in the movie was by Michael Keaton when he says, ""Which story do you want us to write? Because we are writing one of them."" Loved the power in this statement. There are several other scenes that bring the feeling of intensity to this story. One is when Peter (Paul Guilfoyle) is talking to Robby (Keaton) in the bar telling him that a lot of people need the church, basically telling him he needs to leave this alone. Then when Mike comes running out of the courthouse after getting proof of the sensitive documents disclosing everything about the Church. This scene goes through a passage of time of Mike reading what he found to being present in front of his colleagues, sharing this information from the documents. The scene gets intense between Robby and Mike because Mike wants to print this now, but Robby says no because Marty told them to get the ""system.""If you like movies based on a true-story, this is a must-see. The story line along with the added sound and lighting will keep you in suspense rooting for this newspaper team to get the answers needed to uncover the truth. In my opinion, the film bears a close comparison to A Few Good Men with Tom Cruise as a military lawyer defending two U.S. Marines charged with killing a fellow Marine at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.Both of these great movies are similar in that they are searching for the truth to uncover a conspiracy."
" Extremely well done film on an even more important topic
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,10,"This was really a great film. Though perhaps it might not be 100,00 % perfect i still could not find any flaw whatsoever. This film really deserved its Oscars!Very subtle and credible acting and character development of all the stars, and there were some of them, and the supporting actors and actresses as well. The script was really impressing and the directing as well. Would i recommend this film? Absolutely YES! And certainly not only but especially to roman-catholics but to more or less everyone as this film broaches out the massive sexual abuse of children for decades if not centuries by priests of all levels of the roman-catholic church and, what's even more important: The attempts of the church and its representatives and also external ""very important high-level"" persons to cover things up and to drive the victims into suicide and lots of mental and social problems ...A really very important film and luckily really very well done in every aspect! Thanks a lot to all involved in the making of this masterpiece! :-)"
" My favorite film!
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,10,"This is such a phenomenal film. The soundtrack. The acting. The script. The authenticity.I think that Liev Schreiber and Rachel Mcadams both gave their best performances of their careers in Spotlight. Mark Ruffallo should have won an Oscar for his performance. ""It's time! It's time!"". That moment released so much angst and gave me chills. Michael Keaton was also fantastic, of course.Howard Shore gave so much life to the movie through music and it rivals the work that he did on The Lord of the Rings.10/10
5 Stars
Two thumbs up
Must watch
Best film Oscar winner!I rest my case."
" One of the best movies EVER
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,10,"Spotlight is probably the best Best Picture. This movie is the only movie so far that has gotten an A+. It gets it because of its beautiful acting and its beautifully told story.
 What surprised me the most was the fact that it only won two Oscars. I mean sure it won Best Picture, but all the acting awards it was nominated for they did not win. The 88th Academy Awards had Leonardo DiCaprio for Best Actor, Mark Rylance for Best Supporting Actor, Brie Larson for Best Actress, and Alicia Vikander for Best Supporting Actress. So I can see why it did not win any of the Acting Oscars. Even though it had some amazing performances I guess that does not mean it wins them. Spotlight got snubbed at the Golden Globes, which I do not agree with, the gave the Award for Best Motion Picture-Drama to The Revenant. This does not help the fact that I already hate the Golden Globes. This makes me hate them even more, so good job.
 Mark Ruffalo delivers the audience a phenomenal acting job. He did get an Oscar nomination but he did not win it. Rachel McAdams got the other nomination but did not win it ( sadly) but again there was no way that Spotlight could win any of the acting awards. Spotlight is super depressing but it is so well made that you feel an emotional bond to these characters, so good job on the writing, and hay, they won the Oscar for Best Writing-Original Screenplay. This movie makes you suddenly get more cautious of the fact that, you might live next to or go to church with child molesters.
 Spotlight is rated R for some language including sexual references ( official MPAA rating). You could show your kids this when they are about thirteen maybe fourteen. This movie is on the list of movies you have to watch sometime in your life. You will probably watch it if you go to film school.
 Spotlight is the best 21st Century Best Picture. I give Spotlight an A+, for its beautiful acting and its beautifully told story."
" Spot On!
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,8,"'Spotlight' is wonderful edge on your seat fact based drama. Prime example who to make thrilling procedure films. Strong script, magnificent cast and almost anonymous directing makes it entertaining yet thoughtful film. With it's smoothly fast pace 'Spotlight' is much more entertaining than most modern action thrillers. The cast is probably one of the best ensembles in any movie from recent years - no stand alone shining performance. All actors supported each other with such dedication that it was as powerful as stage play. The director (Tom McCarthy with whom I'm not familiar with) managed to keep focus unlike many other such dramas that have failed because they just can't stay true on tone or pace. There are no fancy cinematography or stylized takes, and in this case it is good, because otherwise it could get distracting.A film done right about journalism done right."
" The Academy Screws Up By Not Naming This Best Picture in 2015
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,8,"I do not understand why a movie released in 2015, a year when Birdman won Best Picture, did not get the award for the year it was released. This movie is a great gritty crime drama that is much better than that other picture. It is nice that it was named best in 2016, but by awarding the underserving Birdman in 2015 instead of this movie, the academy chose a flaky comedy film over an excellent film in 2015.It also robbed The Revenant and Denzell Washington's Fences more deserved attention than they films got. Especially Fences, which deserved more attention than they got, and one of these should have gotten best picture in 2016. So somehow Spotlight got the award a year late from an Awards organiztion that is a few shingles short. (Maybe they need the new shingles shot?)Spotlight takes a great true story and elevates it into a great film, and it should not have taken 14 months for this movie to receive the Best Picture. I do give Spotlight kudos for not changing the story for dramatic effect. The story is dramatic enough and the writing realized this. Morgan Freeman annouced this winner at the ceremony.This is a film still worth catching."
" #ME Too
",2018-05-17 00:00:00,10,"When I watched this movie it was like watching myself. The survivor of such horrendous abuse, to then being silenced like it was nothing. I watched and nodded along to the actors portraying the survivors. But for me it was not the Catholic church that covered up my abuse. It was another religious group. What got me in this story was, that it was not just me it happened to. This is OUR story. It has been going on for decades. Probably even before media was a thing in a world where children were meant to be seen and not heard. I believe that children should be seen and equally heard. The monster for me was not meant to be my leader or my father (biological father sad but true) The monster was meant to be the imaginary being under my bed. The movie itself was fantastic, and maybe it's because I am a survivor I don't know, but felt connected to the story. It is rare for movies to do that to me. The actors playing these roles were absolutely amazing. I like Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams anyway. I like Michael Keaton and remember him in the movies that I was not allowed to watch as a child through the 80's-90's, because of magic and the cult rules I was forced into, yet caught up with them in my adulthood. Michael is a phenomenal actor. He takes the serious role in this well and plays it well, in direct contrast to Beetlejuice. If anyone is thinking of watching Spotlight and has not done so yet, I highly recommend it. As a survivor just be prepared for possible triggers along the way, but know that you can also say #ME Too and that we are not alone."
" Spectacular
",2018-04-30 00:00:00,10,I'm just curious as to what people are thinking if they can give this movie anything less than a nine. The moment I left the theater I predicted that it would win best picture even though once the Oscars began it was considered a longshot.
" Very boring movie
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,1,"Very boring movie
I didn't enjoy while watching this movie, unfortunately i disappointed of this movie"
" So what ?
",2018-04-13 00:00:00,4,"I don't get it, all these positive reviews, I read the short description of the movie, I really liked the idea, it's a very sensitive subject that had to be discussed sooner or later, but 60 minutes into the movie and I dropped it, like seriously ? It's so boring, all these names thrown here and there, it's dialogue-heavy for no obvious reason, there is no important dialogue going on, just a bunch of workers, handling a case, interviewing a bunch of victims, and voilà, nothing more. I felt underwhelmed, bored to death. If it were not for the subject-matter, or the actors, this movie would get a zero. So for subject matter and actors' performances : 4/10"
" Loved it and this is why
",2018-04-11 00:00:00,9,"Above being a superb movie, it's a very necessary movie. The story needed to be broadcast to the word and there was no better way to do so than this. This movie had me from the begining. Cinematography didn't really bring anything new and exciting but it definitely wasn't a fluke. Direction was great but the overall biggest and most compelling aspect as the acting. This movie had them all. Micheal Keaton and Mark Rufallo's performances gave me chills. They made me believe that they were the ones actually reporting on this story. I'm glad this movie was brought to the screen, not only as an outstanding movie, but as a testament against time that the good in people will prevail when the evil in people try to hide the truth. It deserved best picture for sure. 8.9 out of 10 stars! What a great movie."
" If you love a great crime investigation, this is for you!
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,8,"I really loved this movie! Great actors that did an amazing job, fascinating plot that really drives you in and get you invested, it's beautifully shot and really gives the movie its feel. 
So if you're a sucker for unsolved crimes and unlikely villains this is absolutely not going to disappoint and definitely worth the watch!"
" Great story, underpowered film
",2018-03-16 00:00:00,6,"The story of this film needs no explanation. It is a very powerful subject and sometimes it makes me wonder how these subjects are allowed in Hollywood. Corruption is everywhere. With the internet expanding and our view of the news changing, as depicted in the film, we have been discovering such stories more and more. The film's execution of its serious subject was not as powerful as it needed it to be. There was only subtle criticism of the Church and the subject of sexual abuse. There should have been more vivid and effective ways of criticizing the behaviour and the cover-up. I don't know if this is even possible considering the power of religious institutions; it might not have been possible to do much more, so we can't blame without knowing the truth. This is not the only reason why I found the film underperformed. The acting was weak, excluding Mark Ruffalo. And I couldn't find myself getting into the story as much as I would've expected to. The story and the subject along with Ruffalo's performance saved this film to be above average. Still, I would recommend it for the story."
" Finding Facts Is Hard Work
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,8,"""Spotlight"" details the people, methods, and investigative processes surrounding a newspaper's desire to expose, detail, and reveal the molestation of children by Catholic priests in the Boston, MA area in the 1970s. The value of the film demonstrates the procedures and policies that true investigative reporters will follow in order to find facts that can be revealed in order to assure accuracy that cannot be mitigated. It's hard work, classifying, categorizing, detailing, fact-checking, and memorizing real-time and historical information just to write an exposé that overcomes ""just-to-sell newspapers"" column. A film well worth viewing."
" An entertaining, if not always enjoyable, picture than exudes a palpable sense of the newsroom.
",2018-03-08 00:00:00,7,"Though there's not much flair and 'Spotlight (2015)' feels far too long, this true-story conspiracy uncovering is a pretty compelling and rather raw affair compounded by a consistent sense of realism and several superb central performances. It does often rely too heavily on the fact it's based around real-life, nerve-touching events to garner an emotional reaction from some basic tactics or otherwise almost boring moments, but overall it's an entertaining if not always enjoyable picture that gets its themes across while always exuding a palpable sense of the newsroom. 7/10"
" An interesting take on ""crime drama""
",2018-03-06 00:00:00,7,"As a Roman Catholic, I can safely say that these abusive men are pieces of garbage, and have no place anywhere but Hell. It is also tough to see this type of scandal and take hatred from others that like to group you with these monsters and not be shaken spiritually. That being said, in order for me to get anything out of this movie, I realized that I needed to put myself, and my beliefs, out of the picture. So, as far as unbiased feelings about the film, I thought it was an interesting and different perspective on crime films. Taken from a newspaper's point of view, this has the potential to inspire other artists to create a similar premise in the future. The acting is also very strong, and the screenplay is another solid aspect of this movie.With this in mind, I felt the camerawork, although not bad, was boring and lifeless at times. The film also dragged at points making it feel longer than it actually is. Overall, it has a strong message that can be applied to anybody. That message being to realize that there are bad apples in all organization, and that those we may trust have secrets that could be dangerous to others. Not a mind-blowing film for me, but strong overall. Highly recommend viewing to gain a message from the movie yourself."
" A movie that shows how twisted and sick the society really is.
",2018-03-06 00:00:00,7,"Since I am studying journalism, our professor showed us this movie during our class and I am happy she did so, since I felt ashamed that I did not know this movie until then. It shows how hard, dedicated and loved journalism as profession really is and at the same time, it shows the truth that hides behind the curtain. There is a reason why journalism and journalists are called the 7th power of society, and this movie is a clear proof about that. It reminds people once again that they need to be careful with their surroundings, even when the church is the subject of matter."
" More thrilling than most thriller movies!
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,8,"It's a story of unglamorous leg-work rather than thundering revelation. The drama here comes from the detail, and the reporters' slow realisation that their investigation could change the world far beyond Boston's city limits. The Church's power is revealed as smoke, mirrors and an unwarranted sense of deference, with journalism at its best proving its worth.Director Thomas McCarthy's great strength is in his refusal to pander to audiences, or to default to easy answers; the correct reaction to the team's work is horror rather than jubilation. And while admirable, the reporters take some blame upon themselves. This crisis, after all, developed under their noses and it took an outsider to force them to examine it. Similarly, the cast (Mark Ruffalo was freakin' good!) modestly play down their characters' achievements and reputations. There is no Oscar-bait grandstanding (well, maybe one moment) and they all look quietly dowdy without indulging in any unnecessary uglification. These journalist greats could happily have rubbed shoulders with Woodward and Bernstein in All The President's Men, and they bring down an even bigger institution.Talky and intelligent, this lacks the glib edge of Aaron Sorkin or the poppy zip of Tarantino. Given the subject matter, too much lightness would be inappropriate. Instead, its tone is led by its characters, moving from scepticism to revelation and the uncomfortable sense that we should all feel guilty for ignoring the secrets too hard to acknowledge."
" Nicely directed! Something to think about!
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,8,"This movie has a really good flow which opens everyone's eye. Somethings we never even think, but unfortunately exists. This story makes us realize that people are s**t even for the few years they live. I'm a Buddhist, but I admit this can be the sad truth in any religion, because people are so weird and unpredictable. Its really good to get a chance to watch a movie like this to get our eyes open. Thanks."
" Not only physical abuse, it's spiritual abuse too.
",2018-02-17 00:00:00,8,"It's important to spread the truth. Always. 
We've been hiding for so many years a lot of topics worth knowing, but this, is a very shocking one. Child abuse is not only a crime but an abomination. It doesn't matter who or when, nor even why. 
For a long time I've heard from family and friends a wide set of justifications: ''well, it's something that happens'', ''don't worry, they take those priests out of church'' but it doesn't happen. 
We shouldn't expect this from any citizen, especially from the religious people who are supposed to spread love and good values. That's why we are so afraid to accuse them, it's a challenge even to ourselves. ''How to say 'no' to God?, right?''The film is excelent representing this topic in a subtle way, especially for those who are quite sensitive. The acting, the photography, the atmosphere. I enjoyed this film. It deserved that Oscar."
" 3 Years on, 5 viewings and it gets me everytime
",2018-02-12 00:00:00,10,"I cannot fault this film and I really should have reviewed this earlier. Having recently been very disappointed with this years 'The Post' I went back to watch I see as the definitive investigative journalist movie. After 5 viewings I felt I needed to pay the cast, crew and director some very small payback in recommending it to anyone reading an IMDB review some 3 years after release.This movie has a scene I will never get over. The Mark Ruffalo outburst. I remember clearly at the Cinema literally grabbing the arms of the chair as I felt the character's emotion and angst. Hell, I laugh and cry and many movies but that scene, this creation, stirs emotions I have never felt watching a movie.The movie is pretty much faultless. What a story, what a movie. It deserved so many more Oscars that it received. I have no doubt whatsever it will stand the test of time.Please watch it."
" Must-watch
",2018-02-12 00:00:00,10,Shook me to make myself more useful to the world! It shows how often we blame others but sometimes don't do our parts ourselves. It's never to late to do our part and make ourselves useful!
" Authentic, well acted and important piece of filmmaking
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,9,"A film that was on my 'Haven't got round to seeing it yet' list. Until now.Journalists at the Boston Globe investigate sexual abuse of children by local Roman Catholic priests- and uncover much more.This is based on a true story and feels authentic and not over-dramaticised for the big screen.The locales are pinpoint perfect too. Note the cramped offices of The Globe compared to the splendid locations frequented by the higher echelons of the church and those paid to defend them. Corruption pays well- but only if you have no soul.Notice also the Boston street scenes- this is a film that loves the city.The performances are also amazing. Mark Ruffalo deserves special praise here- the best performance I've seen in a film in a long, long time. Batman was pretty damn great too :)A brilliant film that indeed casts the spotlight onto the darkest of places. This deserves all of the many accolades it received and continues to receive."
" Spotlighted.
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,9,"I didn't know what this film was about.After it was finished, I spent an hour on Google absorbing the real story.It's well shot, gripping almost entirely throughout (the start is a little too slow), and manages to make a news team covering a story into a masterful story full of drama and intense characterization.It's a fitting film for a fantastic story."
" Digging Up Dirt Will Get You Dirty
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,9,"In Short: There isn't much more I can say that nearly 500 other users haven't already said.You know the subject matter, proceed with caution. Tales like this are difficult to watch, especially knowing that it's a true story. Added to that misery is the knowledge that stories like this continue to happen, if not in the Church certainly in everyday society. Perhaps not the cover-ups, but assuredly the same kinds of tragedies. This movie is the epitome of of term 'thought provoking'. You will talk about it; you will discuss it; and that's exactly what needs to happen.TWO things you will LIKE about the movie: 1) The performances are nothing short of outstanding. The actors are as passionate, serious and disciplined as the real journalists and victims they portray. 2) Josh Singer, Tom McCarthy's script. This is a well written, well researched emotional masterpiece.TWO things you will NOT LIKE about the movie: 1) Digging up dirt will get you dirty almost as much as being there. This is depressing subject matter. If you're a survivor, this movie is undoubtedly a trigger. 2) The length. It's over 2 hours long, so get comfortable."
" What an eye opener.
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,8,"I really liked this movie. I think that it captured a raw representation of pedophilia within the Cathlic church. It was discusting to find out that there were so many preists and pastors that were mulesting and violeting teenagers, young boys and girls.
I think that making a movie on this serious and applicable subject is very important, when it comes to spreading the news. Because of hollywoods influence on our opinions."
" Unbelievably Good. Waiting for the Same Movie about Vaccine Injuries
",2018-01-08 00:00:00,10,"The story is what drives this movie. It follows like a great detective novel. And of course its true as we all know. The exact same thing is happening at grander scale with vaccines. Its the exact same scenario. No one can believe anyone would intentionally hurt kids in this country. We think people are essentially good. The people who should be saying something, doing something, are looking the other way, completely complicit in the cover-up.What is happening in pediatrician's offices at ""wellness"" check-ups and at the CDC will make the Catholic priest scandal of the 2000s look like a minor speed bump. The modern vaccine era will go down as one of the most horrific periods in human history.There was no autism before 1986, almost zero. We now have 3.5 million autistic kids and young adults. The rate for boys is 3.5%. 288,000 kids in the last 3 years. And autism is just the tip of the iceberg. There is no such thing as ""SIDS"". It doesn't exist in nature, no other species in the animal kingdom has it. We are literally killing kids in America with vaccine shots and no one is doing anything about it. ADD, ADHD, allergies - 50% of kids are being affected by vaccines.Parents have seen it first hand, but no one is asking them what happened. No one is interviewing the parents for the news. It takes a lot of people to run a successful cover-up, a lot of denial, and that's exactly what is happening. To say ""vaccines don't cause autism"" is adding insult to injury to parents who have seen their children regress into autism right after the MMR shot. The pertussis shot and SIDS is even worse Where are the heroes? Where are the newspaper reporters? Autism rates continue to climb. The only reason rates have slightly abated the last few years is because of the antivaxxer movement. They are today's true heroes. They are the only ones with real guts, shouting in the darkness, as this madness continues. How much longer? Wake up America."
" Extremely well done - probably wins Best Picture Oscar
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"'Spotlight' and 'The Big Short' will forever be linked, which speaks to their quality - both based on true stories that effected lots of people, both great dramas, both Oscar-nominated films out within weeks of each other. 'Spotlight' has some laughs, but not as many as 'The Big Short', mostly due to the dark nature of the material - the uncovering of Catholic priests molesting and raping young children, for over four decades.The Boston Globe investigative journalism team (""Spotlight"") - from when newspapers were still relevant, in 2001 - consisting of Mike (Ruffalo), Sacha (McAdams), Matt (d'Arcy James) and their editor, Robby (Keaton) are tasked with finding out if an accused priest is in fact guilty of child molestation. This comes about when their bosses, Marty (Schreiber, still looking like Sabretooth) - new at the newspaper - & Ben (Slattery) try to shake things up when they smell a cover up. It turns out there's far more than one priest and one victim - some of the true stories told by the victims as the reporters uncover the facts are truly horrendous and gut-wrenching. Definitely not easy to hear, as you know it has happened in real life, and probably hundreds of thousands of times over the last century.How Ruffalo is only up for Best Supporting Actor, and not Best Actor, is past me! McAdams, on the other hand, is not that utilised - both due to the ensemble cast, I guess. Keaton and Schreiber are good, as is Tucci as the crusading small-time lawyer, but Ruffalo really steals the show, with his heart on the line and it shows in his performance. It's really a great film about newspaper reporting, but is told so well and deals with such an important topic that it is actually enjoyable to watch everyone excel - including director McCarthy, who already has form with 'Win Win'. Certainly not ""fun"", but a great film."
" Nothing groundbreaking, but still fantastic
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,9,"There's nothing especially groundbreaking here: investigative journalists uncover a big story. Imagine ""All The President's Men"" with abusive priests. But the ensemble's simply fantastic, and McCarthy lets them take center stage while the audience investigates alongside them. The film's rhythm is just like research/writing: small leads, longer convos, bigger patterns and the sudden connecting of dots. The story becomes so much more than the abuse scandal we already knew about. It is an affecting revelation...for the characters and the audience."
" A Masterpiece!!
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,10,"Aside from the subject matter I think this movie is an example of the best the industry has to offer. To call Spotlight a docudrama would be a disservice. The script, direction and the ensemble cast made me feel like a voyeur, a fly on the wall watching these people work. 
Immediately I was lost in the story. I loose sight of these people as actors and for two hours I'm transported to Boston, the Globe offices and the meeting rooms and living rooms where the story develops. Much like viewing painting or listening a musical masterpiece I can (and do) watch this movie over and over."
" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",2017-12-13 00:00:00,10,"The truth is always stranger than fiction and that's why it makes for the best movies. Spotlight is the 2016 Academy Award Winner for Best Picture and it was well deserved. This star studded cast comes together to tell the true story of how the Boston Globe was finally able to breakthrough the decades long wall of silence, and expose the Catholic Church's child molestation scandal. Michael Keaton headlines this all-star cast and shows that while he's been out of the spotlight (pun intended) for some time now, he hasn't lost a beat. As the enigmatic leader of the newspaper's Spotlight section, Walter Robinson (Keaton) will not give up the fight for the truth, no matter the personal cost. Even when his own bosses tell him the story is dead and to give up, he refuses to let it go and he shows that one man with a mission really can change the world. This film doesn't simply shine a light on the Catholic Church in a way it would rather nobody ever had, but it also gives views an in depth, inside look at all the intricacies that go into investigative journalism. With all the reports of fake news and all of us who simply get our news from staring at a screen, it's hard to think about all the effort that goes into getting that information from real life to print and I personally found the process fascinating. This film has a lot going for it, from an inside look at a long forgotten industry to the mysteries behind a long hidden secret. It features some terrific writing and more than one outstanding performance. You don't get six Oscar nominations by accident. This is a great film and a great addition to our list of can't miss movies!"
" Beautiful journalistic movie
",2017-12-01 00:00:00,8,After a long time I watched one good journalistic movie.how they take on a powerful institution which controls the whole system.they show what is investigative journalism and how it is done.they are ready to face everything just to expose the institution and what they are doing.good acting by all and couldn't find anything which could have avoided in movie.its a must watch movie.
" An adaptation of a real story that is respectful and serious.
",2017-11-23 00:00:00,9,"In Spotlight we find a sublime film that has been able to adapt a real event to the big screen.He has many points in his favor, among them the seriousness and respect with which he deals with this subject towards both parts of the story. It is incredible as yet without going too far into the personal life of the protagonists we are able to know them and have some sympathy for them.Without a doubt, it is not a film whose first visualization makes all the points clear, but even when you see it several times, it is not a film that bores, on the contrary, by knowing what happens, more attention is paid to the details, attitudes of the characters, what they say and how they say it.The only thing that does not stop liking me, is that several characters that seem to have relevance, appear once and then do not know anything else about them. Now, I do not know to what extent is the reality or director and screenwriters preferred not to extend the plot."
" A great movie, at last!
",2017-10-31 00:00:00,8,"Spotlight. Nominated for best motion picture (won), supporting actor (Mark Ruffalo), supporting actress (Rachel McAdams), original screenplay (Johs Singer and Tom McCarthy- won), best direction (Tom McCarthy), and best editing (Tom McArdle). Remarkable film, with great directing work. Everyone in the cast is well, and Rachel's performance, and especially Ruffalo's, are great. Honorable mention must be made for Michael Keaton, who although belatedly consolidates himself as a great actor, after an irregular beginning and a half career; and also to Liev Schreiber, who plays with surgical precision the role of editor Marty Baron. Every supporting cast is strictly embedded, which is undoubtedly merit of the director. The editing of the film is accurate, a difficult job, in view of the excellent but intricate script. The plot tells the true story of an investigation into sexual abuse of children by Catholic church fathers. A group of journalists from the Boston Globe were charged with raising the accusations. The deepening of the evidence brought the case to gigantic proportions. The script is unraveled so that the viewer is taken aback, to the same extent that journalists find, terrified, that sexual abuse in the Catholic Church is systemic, methodical and diabolically obscured by the highest echelons of the institution. Whoever sees the film becomes part of the team, and it is impossible not to be moved at various times. Spotlight is an excellent film, which does not seek to deepen the discussion about religion, but rather what institutions like the Catholic Church make of it. 8 out 10."
" Bringing beneath the spotlight
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,10,"A truth unmasking movie. To some extents, it might be unbelievable to you. Everyone should find time to watch this film great acted by some talented actors. On a different note, you might be fallen in love with the profession of journalism. So, those want to be a journalist, this is a must watch."
" Poorly executed.
",2017-10-18 00:00:00,5,"Spotlight The subject matter is incredibly important. Like VERY important. And maybe that is why this film isn't that good, the film makers were too overwhelmed or something, who knows. All I can tell you is that it put me to sleep, twice. I fell asleep around an hour into the film and woke up towards the end. So I went back to the part I fell asleep at but dozed off again and just left it at that."
" Investigative drama
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,4,"Biographical drama about the research by the Boston Globe' Spotlight team on the scandal of child abuse by priests covered up by the local archdiocese. It's an investigative drama, but that's it: good acting, but nothing extraordinary that would take this film to win the Oscars for best movie and screenplay. Reasonable information documentary type, yes; good movie, no. What we see is just some people scheduling some interviews and asking other people questions to gather information and publish an article. Where's the story in that for a movie? By the way, why does not Hollywood make a movie about 'pedophilia in Hollywood'?"
" Compelling, Chilling and Cold-Hard Truth.
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,10,"As a Roman Catholic who attends mass weekly I thought I knew all about the child abuse scandal within the RC' Church and well after watching 'Spotlight' it is certainly safe to say I didn't know the half of it.This fantastically compelling, yet chilling, title has really opened my eyes and educated me on the investigation that the journalists of the Boston Globe's Spotlight Team carried out between 2001 & 2002. Putting the fantastic script and acting aside, my credit goes to the real life journalists. The emotional side effects this investigation would have caused them is hard to think about, but exposing the truth must have been very worthwhile. Watching the film I found it hard at first to understand how this could happen and how a priest could abuse a child within a parish. But the film follows the investigation very carefully and answered every question going around in my head at the time of watching it and revealed everything I wanted to know and more. I don't want to give away too much in my review, but I will say this. If you are like me and think that you know what had happened in the child abuse scandal I would urge you to think again and watch this film. That's all I will say. With regards to the actual film? Well its fantastic. The camera work, the acting, the script...everything about this film is compelling and is sure to glue your eyes to that TV screen (or what ever device you happen to watch on). In the end I am happy that I took the time to watch this, it was very informative and has educated me greatly on the situation and made me think about a lot of things, not regarding my faith, it is still as strong as ever, but regarding the Roman Catholic Church and its hierarchy etc. Anyway, I'm going to stop talking, give it a watch, be informed and enjoy every minute of this chilling, compelling and informative thriller/drama. 10/10"
" Felt very long and slow paced.
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,7,"I really wanted to enjoy this film, as I knew the true story behind it. I just felt it wasn't told properly, or could have been told better via its screenplay.Don't get me wrong, it was a great cast, but some of the performances felt flat at times, and again, I blame it on the screenplay and/or the direction.The pace also felt very slow and although 2 hrs and 8 mins aren't abnormal for a movie, this one felt like it was over 3 hours.Still an enjoyable viewing, but had it been tweaked a little better (editing dept?), I may have enjoyed it more.It's a 7/10 from me."
" Involving topical story, excellent performances but not a great movie
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,6,"I watched this film with high expectations, as the warmly favourable criticisms published on the media together with the viewers' ratings in IMDb seemed to unanimously commend it as one of the best films of the year. Overall I was rather disappointed. Not that I did not enjoy the film, but I thought that its making was kind of perfunctionary, not as gripping and involving as its subject allowed for. What I mean is that there was no suspense at all. Its documentary style simply displayed and unfolded the facts in a kind of smooth monotonous way. Indeed the real story which it tells is terribly shocking and heart-wrenching by itself, but it was dealt with without much passion or cinematic warmth. I think that the film is sustained only by two elements, which at least are strong enough to make it enjoyable: the story and the cast. The performances of all the actors are outstanding in this film, the best on my view being those by Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber and Stanley Tucci. Apart from that, not a specially remarkable movie. sorry to disagree with the majority opinion."
" By the numbers
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,1,I can't remember a movie that's SO by-the-numbers as this movie was. I don't get the Oscar win. Everyone has that movie that everybody loves but you just HATE. This is mine I guess. Think investigative reporter- movie and chances are you'll think of something more exciting than this. I thought The Revenant was boring too but that's a trimming issue. It had some very memorable cinematic scenes I can still remember. Spotlight feels like a Law and Order episode. Ugh..I'm out.
" A heavy subject dealt with rivetingly
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,10,"'Spotlight' to me was a very worthy Best Picture winner. Even if it didn't do much for me, which it did, it would still be appreciated for what it set out to do and would have been applauded for trying.It took on a very heavy subject, that is still very much relevant today, and does it in a way that's riveting with a strong emotional core, strong insight that illuminates and tells of stuff that we didn't know (that leaves us shocked and very angry) and not fall into the trap of having too much of things that we knew already. It also never feels mawkish or preachy, traps that it also could have fallen into.While it is a deliberate and relatively slow-paced film, it didn't leave me bored for a second, instead gluing me in with its excellent performances across the board, how it tells its story, it's beautifully balanced screenplay and sheer class. Tom McCarthy's direction has all the class and professionalism that 'Spotlight' needed.Other strengths are the way it's filmed, it's very atmospheric and evocative in its detail and the cinematography is gritty and ravishing. The music fits beautifully, 'Spotlight's' script and story are engrossing and quietly intelligent and the characters are written compellingly.Acting is excellent across the board. Both Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams give career-best performances worthy of award recognition, particularly Ruffalo. Michael Keaton's performances here and in the previous year's 'Birdman' are his best in years, a very commanding turn. Brian D'Arcy James are up to their level.Overall, a riveting and brave film that does wonders with a difficult subject matter. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
" I miss the Ottoman Empire.
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,6,"So, this film raises a good question: should the genre of a film be taken into account when considering the overall quality? I understand that for the horror genre, it's generally well accepted that dumb characters and logic gaps are par for the course. The reason being that most people don't take horror too seriously, especially in the mainstream market. So with that in mind, does this film cement the standard for the ""journalism"" genre as one which requires no real direction or anything even remotely exceptional on a visual level? The blocking, cinematography, and art direction feel just flat out lazy and uninspired. All the scenes are constructed as though it were a Star Wars prequel. Just have a couple of characters stand around and talk to each other, and to spice it up we'll have them walk to a different part of the office. No effort is made to arrange the characters or the camera in a creative way which makes any scene distinguishable from the others. So of course a natural counter to these complaints would be that the film is portraying the story with the realism it requires. The idea is that it's showing the journalists doing their jobs without exaggeration or sensationalist elements. It should be as it actually happened. May I ask though, in what way the plot would be seriously altered by creative cinematography or having the characters do something interesting while they're having dialogue? The lines don't have to change. The sequence of events don't have to change. The screenplay doesn't even really have to change. The director simply has to put in the effort to make it look even just a little bit interesting. Why not have a scene where one of the characters is putting together a jigsaw puzzle while the other is pacing around the room try to solve their own mental puzzle? I know that example is kind of dumb but it's a simple change that I think would make just about any scene in this film more interesting. Of course if it's shot in the same flat style as the rest of it then there wouldn't be much of a difference. I want to clarify that I don't think this film is bad. It's just not really exceptional. If you like it then that's fine. There are things to like about it. The point I'm trying to make is that this is a film and not a radio drama. It takes more then having your actors stand there, having them recite some logistical dialogue, and call it good. Just because this film is about journalism doesn't mean that it just has to be people talking and nothing else. If you don't want to tarnish this story with the utilization of film making techniques then maybe you shouldn't bother with adapting it to begin with. Since this story was adapted into film however, I am going to consider it the same way I would consider any other film. As such it is not very good. It's okay. That's it. There is no excuse for mediocrity in film, whatever the story. Spotlight doesn't get a free pass because it's about reporters. Wouldn't really recommend it."
" Turn on your Spotlight.
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,9,"Spotlight ( 9 out of 10) Everyone has pet peeves when it comes to movies. We hate romantic comedies based entirely on misunderstandings, we hate horror films where no one's cell phone works, or we simply hate movies that have either the word Adam or Sandler on the poster.I hate true story movies that simply make things up. You know the type. We need a bad guy so let's take a real person and turn him into a racist (Hidden Figures), a murderer (Titanic), or a woman (Patch Adams). We need to condense the timeline and change real historical events (Oscar-nominated Hidden Figures again). We need to change the character's sexuality so modern audiences can relate (The Danish Girl). We need fascist slaveholders to talk about democracy and freedom (300). And the list goes on and on. This is without even mentioning Mel Gibson historical dramas that might as well have dinosaurs wandering through them.One of my other pet peeves? Movies that take place in an office or business world made by people who clearly have never spent more than a day working in one. Like ahistorical true stories, this is ripe territory for rage. We have the office politics of Catwoman's evil beauty cream manufacturer. Not to be outdone the less said about how Wayne Industries is run ( a publicly traded company mind you) in the Batman universe the better. It isn't just superhero movies either. Romantic comedies often need a trip to HR and no making everyone an architect does not solve that. (Seriously do these movies even know what architects or museum directors or magazine publishers actually do during their work day?)Spotlight easily could have fallen into both these traps. It simply doesn't. The timeline is correct. The discussions between professionals sound well professional. There are no made up heavy's to create drama, no fake romantic love interest, no surprise terrorist attack. Okay, it does have the last one but in all fairness, the movie's timeline starts in August 2001 and runs through the end of the year. But even in that moment, the movie handles it with intelligence and in a realistic manner. There is a calmness and a professionalism in this movie that is refreshing. It rings true in both the big and small things. It is one of the best films I have seen this year."
" A Hallowing Investigative Treatise
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,9,"I'm a big fan of investigative films, with recent-ish efforts like ""Zodiac"" and ""The Insider"" immediately coming to mind as favorites. ""All The President's Men"", of course, is the industry standard for this type of filmmaking. ""Spotlight"" can easily hold its own with all those great films.For a basic plot summary, ""Spotlight"" tells the story of the investigative crew of the Boston Globe who unearthed a large child abuse scandal (clergy molesting children) that was being covered up by the Catholic Church. Reporters played by Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, and John Slattery all combine to pry the lid off of the scandal through diligent reporting and copious research.What I really like about ""Spotlight"" is how it presents the material almost without ""editorial comment"" (to steal an apt newspaper phrase). This isn't so much a movie about the Catholic Church scandal (though implicitly it can be read as such, I guess) as it is a film about the journalistic/investigative process needed to unearth such facts. As such, there really is very little verbal or explicit moralizing that takes place on screen. Instead, director Tom McCarthy lets the process unspool and allows the viewer to form their own emotions as each new thread is pulled.Of course, it always helps to have such a who's who of acting talent, and they all work perfectly here. They each bring something unique to the film while also functioning as a competent whole.""Spotlight"" can be a hard movie to watch at times (the subject matter, without being visually graphic, is difficult to digest), but it ends up being an important treatise on the power of journalism and investigation to reign in the power of establishments that feel they might be above the law. Whether you go to Mass every week or think religion is a bunch of hog-wash, you will still be affected by the message of this film.As such, I now better understand why ""Spotlight"" took home Best Picture at the 2016 Academy Awards. Simply put, it is an expertly-crafted film, filled with excellent acting, that also tells an important story. What more can one ask for in a dramatic film?"
" A masterpiece! This is how you make a movie!
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,10,"Wow, what a movie! What a masterpiece.I didn't expect this.It caught me completely off guard.I am very, very demanding when it comes to movies, but this is something really different.It grabbed me in it's claws and didn't release me until it was over-I was mesmerized from beginning till the end of credits with Howard Shores' excellent music playing in the background.This movie is not for those expecting 2 hours of action and blood-this is a movie for intelligent people who search for brilliant stories in this time of low quality, garbage movies (95 % of movies).When the movie ended I was overwhelmed with strong emotions, I wanted to go somewhere, do something, change the world, tell everyone how truly awesome this movie is.For investigative journalism to be this compelling you need to be a masterful movie director.Congratulations to whole team and well deserved Oscar!"
" Well deserved best picture award winner
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,10,"Spotlight is one of the best films I have ever seen. The story/plot, which is based off of true events is a deeply disturbing one. This movie centers around Spotlight, which is an investigative journalist group of reporters at The Boston Globe, and how they investigate the Catholic Church turning a blind eye and ultimately covering up many many priests physically molesting children. The movie does a wonderful job telling this very eye opening shocking story. The actors are a big factor in how powerful and effective the movie is. Rachel McAdams, Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schriver, and Stanley Tucci all turn in great performances. It's my personal opinion that Ruffalo shines the brightest hear and his Oscar nomination is well deserved. Also what makes the film so moving and well made is the writing. The script for the film is very well put together/thought out and it does a great job at doing the true story justice, it takes you to a place of deep emotion. It's just the right runtime too, it's not an overly long film, it's just at two hours, any shorter and it wouldn't be doing the whole story justice, and too much longer would have been stretching it. I thought hearing the victims explain their stories in sometimes graphic detail was absolutely necessary, as McAdams says in one scene: ""the language is going to be very important"". Also the film clearly states and makes it clear that this has nothing to do with being gay, I loved that the filmmakers stated that because molestation can and is often used by overly conservative people as for a reason why people are gay. The very serious and heartbreaking issue that the film tackles is a story that everyone needs to hear and be educated about. This isn't fluff entertainment but it's a powerful important well made film. 10/10."
" ""Spotlight"" uncovering the dark secrets of the Catholic church
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,9,"How far would you go to uncover the dark secrets of the world's largest institute? The Roman Catholic Church a place where people go to find peace and comfort is now tainted with allegations of priest's molesting and raping young boys and girls. In this captivating drama that is based on true events it is up to a team of news reporters to uncover the truth behind it all. I really enjoyed this movie even though going into it I had no idea what it was going to be about. The way ""Spotlight"" is set up is incredibly done and it leaves you feeling dumbstruck because you would have never guessed the outrages actions people did to cover this scandal up. Like I said I had no idea what the plot of this movie was and at the beginning of this movie I could tell this was going to be a very serious. As this movie progressed, I was constantly shocked, surprised, and floored by a remarkably well written, directed, and acted film. This movie truly blew me away. ""Spotlight"" is very subdued in a lot of ways, the movie doesn't make the news reporters look like heroes but rather look like actual news reporters who love their job and just want the truth of this scandal to reach the public. The fact that this is based on a true story is absolutely incredible. ""Spotlight"" directed by Tom McCarthy and with great Hollywood stars like Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo and Liev Schreiber ""Spotlight"" hit the big screen in November 2015. In 2001, editor of the Boston Globe Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) assigns a team of journalist to investigate allegations against a priest named John Geoghan, who was accused of molesting over 80 boys in the city of Boston. Led by editor Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Michael Keaton), who runs a team of reporters such as Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo) and Sachas Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), interview the rape victims of these priest and uncover sensitive information that would relieve the truth of what is really going on within the Roman Catholic Church. These brave reporters make is their mission to find proof that there is a cover-up of sexual abuse of girls and boys by the priest that are said to make these children feel safe within the Roman Catholic Church. No matter how many obstacles these reporters faced nothing would stop them from uncovering the truth. ""Spotlight"" is a film that is so well acted and directed that as you watch it you almost forget that you are actually watching a film, you feel like it is a documentary. The story is so well told that you truly feel these true events are happening right before your eyes despite the fact you know you are looking at Michael Keaton and you know he played Batman or the fact that Mark Ruffalo is the Hulk. Michael Keaton is fantastic in this film and the performance he delivers is absolutely breathtaking with his snarky remarks and straight forward attitude. But the one scene that really tugged on my heart strings was when Mark Ruffalo's character, wanting to publish the story early because he knew that this injustice in the Catholic Church needed to be put in the light but Michael Keaton's characters knew that waiting was the right call because the team still needed more informations to truly take this institute down. Ruffalo's heart warming speech was so well acted it truly had me feel his emotions right through the screen. This film truly excels in making the audience feel for these victims and the reporters trying to get their stories out there. With amazing performances from all of the cast and a great director behind the chair this movie truly is worth watching. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know the truth of how real journalism works and that it is a tough job as any. This film is definitely for a more mature audience and I wouldn't recommend it for children but showing this film to a child would teach them a valuable lesson and that is the world is a dark and scary place but you shouldn't be afraid to seek the truth."
" Sensitive intriguing approach to a sad story
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,9,"Spotlight is a sad and fascinating movie to watch. Sad because it deals with the systematic abuse of children by ministers of the Catholic Church. Unfortunately, this story is nothing that happened just in Boston long ago. Just a couple of weeks ago, an Australian royal commission revealed the same systemic abuse in Australian Catholic churches and boys schools, with higher levels of pedophilia, and similar polices of cover-up and/or disregard for some of the children's complaints. As one of the victims says in the film, ""we were not only raped physically, but also spiritually"".The movie is really intriguing because the focus is mostly on the research carried about by the five people of the Spotlight section in the Boston Globe. This is not an anti-Catholic film at all, or a film against Catholics, but an exposé on how the high spheres of the Catholic Church didn't get rid of the abusers and did nothing to protect and support the children and families abused, ignoring the most vulnerable among the community when they were most in need. I found the whole research process absolutely thrilling. I'm a historical researcher and I know how laborious and demanding research is, but also how rewarding and mind blowing it can be. I loved the fact that the film shows the impact that the investigation had on three of the journos involved, as they were raised Catholic.All the actors do a great job and are convincing in their respective roles. I especially liked McAdams, Ruffalo, Crudrup and Tucci. However, this is a choral movie, and the chorus sings wonderfully in tune. The cinematography and atmosphere are excellent, and the music is absolutely wonderful.The main downside of Spotlight is that the research story becomes a bit flat at moments. A bit of more narrative digging would have lifted up the tone of the movie. 1/ I would have liked more victims' voices being included in the film, and also the details mentioned in the letter of a mother to Cardinal Law being brought out more prominently into the story. 2/ I would have liked having a few of the abusers profiled; we are just hinted the case of Ronald Paquin. 3/ I would have liked to dig into why ""Tempo"" decided not to follow lawyer Mcleish's letter fifteen years before, and why nothing was done when a victims association provided the newspaper with tons of material, way before Baron took the newspaper over; was it lack of interest? He didn't believe the claim? There were more pressing editorial matters? Why specifically such a horrendous case was just ignored for fifteen years or so?Overall, Spotlight is a very good movie, with very good performances, great atmosphere, and very balanced in the way it approaches such a delicate and horrible subject."
" Spotlight on the Church
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,8,"I just watched this movie for the first time concerning a massive cover-up of pedophile priests by the Catholic Church in Boston. I liked the investigative team that went after the story, actors Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams. Ruffalo and McAdams showed the instincts and spunk of true reporters. Once they smelled a rat, they pursued the story relentlessly getting the facts needed to make public aware of the cover-up that kept pedophiles from answering for their crimes. Keaton was the boss who had to ensure the hard evidence was secured to give credibility to the story. Michael Keaton is compelling as the guy who grew up in Boston, attended Boston College and became one of the boys on the golf course hobnobbing with lawyers and journalists. But he knew things were not right in the way his hometown and its dominant religious body was dealing with a grave injustice that was wrecking the lives of many young people. We get the sense of life in Boston with its love of sports and homespun camaraderie, something of a foil to deflect crimes lurking on its own dark side. The new kid on the block, Liev Screiber, is the one who unleashes the hounds as he tries to break through the easygoing veneer of official Boston, particularly its clergy and its lawyers. He shows the uneasiness of a man who doesn't quite fit in but gives his team the support they need to get the story out. A fine movie with great acting from the above as well as Stanley Tucci, John Slattery and Jamie Sheridan. This is a movie that reminds people that institutions have to account for injustice and cover-ups aimed at protecting their sacred turf."

Talking about very sensitive subject for the American community and was a real shock for most of the world which child molestation by some Priest and the Church's tries to cover this up.The movie was very interesting and introduced the subject in a very thrilling way in a subject that may seem ""how would they make a great movie from that?"" and the credit for that returns to the writers of this masterpiece.During this movie you will feel disgusted and fooled many times and you wish you weren't born in this world. How on earth this is happening !! But this is our world and we have to face it, we are here so face it. Enjoy the movie, Enjoy your life but just don't shut up and make yourself blind because it could have been you or your child, that's what this movie is saying to us.I loved the movie a lot and my rating is 9/10."
