" This Series Is Grueling
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,7,"Oh good grief this movie series is grueling.Could have done with fewer scenes of Jennifer Lawrence and Liam Hemsworth sitting around staring at each other, but they did I suppose have to fill out the running time with something seeing as they made the cynical cash grab decision to turn the final book into two movies. I think I don't like Jennifer Lawrence? I'm not sure. She's a good actress, but there's something off putting about her. It makes her perfect casting for Katniss, actually, because most everyone else thinks she's off putting too.I know a dystopian future where people in brown jumpsuits have to live in underground tunnels probably wouldn't be the recipe for a super fun time, but could the movies throw us a moment of levity here or there just for the hell of it? I liked the scene where Katniss is making her demands and she had to refer to her notes before telling the president that her sister gets to keep her cat. More of that please.I didn't read the books so have nothing to compare these movies to, but they're pretty good as far as these kinds of movies go.Grade: B+"
" Mockingjay - Part 1 invests on drama, discuss media manipulation, but has a irregular rhythm
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,6,"In need of an icon to encourage districts to rebel against the Capital, resistance commanders do not think twice about taking advantage of Katniss' popularity. It doesn't matter how it looks, but what it represents - and, for that, nothing better than makeup to sell the product well. The propaganda war between Presidents Snow (Donald Sutherland) and Coin (Julianne Moore) is created, where it is curious to note that both exploit the same tactic. If presenter Caeser Flickerman (Tucci) is biased to the extreme, the resistance film crew also seeks to explore Katniss's emotions in her favor, without the least bit of shame. The end justifies the means, some would say. But if this is true for resistance, wouldn't it also be true for Capital? At least in relation to the method of conduct, there is not that much difference. This similarity deepens even more when he sees the almost tyrannical way in which Coin rules and the fact that, however much she defends democracy, there is not the slightest indication that she has been elected to the position she holds. Once again, good and evil are not that far away in relation to the way of acting, which in itself arouses a series of considerations about the philosophy behind the series.It is precisely this political game behind the scenes that is the most interesting in Mockingjay- Part 1, be it for the manipulative / manipulated duality or for the twists and turns that the script holds. On this board, Katniss and Peeta are mere pawns whose emotions serve the interest of the moment, however much the relationship between them serves as the main line of the script. It is also interesting to note how the other pieces (Haymitch, Effie, Plutarch, Beetee) are relocated in this new reality, each according to their interests: some because of their beliefs, others due to their lack of choice or sense of opportunity.If, on the one hand, it is interesting to see the media manipulation imposed by both the rebels and the Capital with Peeta's interview, on the other hand the hype seems empty. Much expectation is created at all times to make way for nothing. It seems that something is always going to happen, but when it is about to reach a climax, the wait is frustrated. Basically, everything revolves around this small part of the story. Something that could be solved in an hour of film - at most. After all, in the first 60 minutes, the viewer is confronted with a monotonous narrative in which Katniss slowly regains her personality, making visits to territories such as District 8, where an improvised hospital operates and where one of the rare action scenes in this sequence takes place. In fact, this is the film in which explosions and struggles give rise to speeches by social critics. This first part of the adaptation of ""Mockingjay"", has very few action scenes, being more focused on the media war between the rebels of District 13 and the tyrannical Capital.Bearing in mind that the film's narrative is practically all directed towards Katniss (there are rare moments when the character is not on stage), the setting of the story follows its protagonist. There is a contrast between the opulence of the Capital and the poverty of the 12 districts and we began to explore together with the character the besieged environment that is District 13, with quick visits to some other environments touched by the war, especially District 12. Katniss dives in a war environment, where almost everything is plunged into gray practicality. District 13's own scenarios are reminiscent of a war submarine, linear and tight. Seeing the extrovert and hitherto multicolored Effie (Elizabeth Banks) without her extravagant wigs, makeup and strange clothes is the biggest representative of this reality shock for Katniss and the public. Another shock is Peeta's gradual debilitation, portrayed with care by Josh Hutcherson.The Hunger Games arena is left out of this film so that we can get behind the scenes of this revolution. With the action fundamentally taking place at the underground headquarters of the rebellion, in devastated District 13, what we have is darkness and even the beauty of Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss is hidden, rendered speechless by the demands of a heavy story as it should be. This complete change of tone in relation to The Hunger Games and Catching Fire shows the production's courage in doing something different, which will not necessarily please everyone. For that very reason, it is at least necessary to respect what Lionsgate managed to put on the screens.Just as it happened in the first film in the saga, it is gradually that Katniss accepts the role that destiny has imposed on her. Again showing rare courage in blockbusters aimed at teenagers, Francis Lawrence does not shy away from showing images like burnt bodies and crowds machine-gunned by soldiers from the Capital. Katniss' reactions in those moments collide with the pragmatic coldness of Alma Coin, composed by Julianne Moore as someone who has long since passed the point of allowing herself to feel any passion. In fact, it is palpable that Coin and Snow have more in common than the first lets on (and perhaps doesn't even realize it). The propaganda game played by the intelligent Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) depends on Katniss, and the girl's speeches and actions, in order to work with the public, need to be spontaneous and authentic. Thus, Jennifer Lawrence finds herself quite demanded. Not only because of the character's almost omnipresence in the narrative, but because of the range of emotions it requires from Katniss, which ranges from the traumatized girl to the warrior symbol of the rebellion. And, once again, the young actress is up to the challenge. The confidence in Lawrence is such that the production has the luxury of placing Sutherland, Hoffman and Moore in smaller participations, since we follow the story unfolding basically through the eyes of Katniss. The feature film still uses this to its advantage by placing the young woman away from the most elaborate action scenes, relegating her to the role of spectator and creating greater tension in those moments.To give vent to this strong political tone present in the story, director Francis Lawrence needed to make important changes to the series. In addition to the visual change, there are far fewer action scenes compared to previous episodes, as well as greater psychological development of the heroine. There is also a certain loss of dynamics in the narrative, largely due to overly elongated sequences and the very reflective tone that guides part of the film. It is too early to say whether it is to blame the decision to split a book into two films, but this Part 1 could have a shorter duration if it went through a more rigorous edition. The division, for those who read the books, in fact complies with the much desired fidelity in adapting books for the big screen, taking care to create scenes for the smallest details ever written, but fails to win over viewers who do not know the book and, consequently, they have to deal with a film without major events. The division's decision diminishes the brightness of the work as a cinema, in addition to the high risk of transforming the second half into an endless climax, taking the focus away from the introspective moments, the great dramatic force of the series so far.If Mockingjay escaped the trap of the necessarily more explosive sequel, it failed to escape another, which, in fact, is almost a disease in Hollywood: the division of films into several parts in the name of profit. Harry Potter and The Hobbit suffered from this and Mockingjay is the latest victim. There was not enough material for four hours of projection (each of the final two chapters will have slightly more than two hours) and this is evident with the thematic repetition, with Katniss returning to her old district twice, with the same images, the that kills any impact and excruciating delay in understanding Peeta's painfully obvious situation.As a result, Mockingjay loses its rhythm several times, literally looking like a long and inexplicably extended prelude to action. Action that never comes, by the way. There is only one busy sequence in the projection - that of the hospital in District 8, which fulfills its function of showing who the Thrush is and it is surprisingly short and economical, with the production focusing much more on Coin's eternal speeches and interviews Caesar Flickerman's (Stanley Tucci, underutilized) television shows with Peeta. The problem caused by the lack of cadence in the stretched script ends up erasing characters that could have been better used, such as Finnick (Sam Claflin) and Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), in addition to demanding too much of the viewer's patience with slow, contemplative plans and without any kind of reward. Esperança literally looks like what it is: the beginning of an unfinished film.Mockingjay - Part 1 is a good film that points out instigating paths for the series, but, paradoxically, it is also the least impactful. The adaptation is surprisingly faithful to the source material, in addition to having the courage to be a different film compared to the two that came before. The division of Mockingjay prevents a full assessment, but this ""beginning of the end"" certainly validates The Hunger Games as the most courageous and contradictory product of current pop culture. At the same time that it addresses complex issues, condemning social imbalance and the manipulation of the media without fear of showing its own violence. In this part 1, the action drama with political touches manages to give drama to the story and deepen its characters, leaving the action aside (even if it exists and spectacular) to deliver something bigger: a blockbuster with social criticism. However, its narrative claudication, caused by a slow and rhythm less script, prevents the Thrush from taking higher flights."
" Another cliffhanger!
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,7,"It seems The Hunger Games franchise is obsessed with cliff hangers. Two in a row! It's just mad. The film was good though, the end shocked me . The song was beautiful, with the echoes and harmony perfect. The performances were the best so far in my opinion, with Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, and Liam Hemsworth standing out. Some of the scenes were great, some however were not. I don't get why people say so much that this was a let down, maybe for book readers, but I've never read the books or watched the films before, so I don't have that feeling. It was the worst so far, but still good."
" Catnip's Emotions
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,8,"Plot: there are so many things that lacks from the book, and since the split this movie in two I hoped there were many more things in it. Anyway this movie is very mainly about Katniss' emotions, like the book.Actress and Actors & Acting: amazing job, like always. Also the new entries were good.Soundtrack: high quality.Visual Effects: very good for the year it was released.Conclusions; another good episode, but do not cover too well the book and the emotions of Katinss. But it is definitely enjoyable."
" Followed the book to a tee
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,7,"I loved that they followed the book once again to a tee, but for a movie, it made it boring and slow. The last film had so much excitement to it with all the action. Where as this film was more so to set up the next one with less excitement. The filming was still great and all the original cast is involved which makes the movie worth watching."
" CHARLIE WHITE
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie, especially the part with Charlie White. He moves this film from an alright b-film to a masterpice. Imagine this movie without him"
" not good...
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,4,"Big mistake: to make more money, filming in 2 parts...that way it became too long ,boring, sleep inducing comatose film...pity.."
" Worst in the hunger games series
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,7,This movie was boring. It was not like the 1st and 2nd movie .
" The Cat Survives!
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,7,"This film takes a different tack from the previous two. There are no games involved, it's all about the politics of the situation that they have been forced into and the uprising of the districts that are unhappy with their lot.As a ""Part One"" it's difficult to rate it as a film on its own and with my Nephews yapping and generally being a pain all the way through it, I did struggle to hear much of what was going on, so it was a good job I'd seen it before.I know a lot of people didn't like either of the Mockingjay films, but I don't think it is a fault with the film making, just that they don't like the way the original story ends.
As someone who is in fear of the near future and potential apocalypse or dystopia's, I'm glad to watch films that show that the human race doesn't just roll over and let themselves be walked on, but instead rise up and overthrow the system.Of the four films, it is the one with the least action in it and it may not have been necessary to split it into two, as it doesn't really achieve much that couldn't have been added to film 4, but I still like it.I'm not normally one for spoilers, but you can't really review this film, without describing what it's all about."
" the whole movie, has mysterious magic, by Katniss Everdeen.
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,7,"That third movie, has mysterious magic (only mysterious scenes), only that Katniss Everdeen have to solve that experience with: battles, war, and legend. She too traveled to her house to see her mysteries."
" Average movie extremely slow, set up for pt2
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,5,"I'm not a big hunger games fan I felt the story could have been told in 2 movies without all the fluff but Hollywood needs to make money and people whine if it's not like the fricking book. That's so annoying when people compare the movie to the book, hey LISTEN it never will!!! All of us have different interpretations of a story especially a book so your view and a director's will differ greatly!!, so just watch and expect it to entertain you!!"
" I remember being very bored
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,1,I remember being very bored while watching this movie and decided to go on a walk with my father instead. That was 5 years ago and I still remember exactly where I left off. Spending time with my father was a better choice.
" The hunger games: Mockingjay-part 1
",2020-07-22 00:00:00,8,"This is by the most boring movie I've seen this year. The production company just want to squeeze money out of people like me who apparently had nothing to do this Saturday afternoon but to watch a movie that maybe is okay~~ Alright, let me simply tell u why this is complete crap. Story is non- existent. Loop wholes as big as Twilight. Boring emotional scene with lame monologue.I think a law should be passed to forbid producing so many sequels for a single movie. It just make use of people's desire to finish something and the recognition from the first.. Frankly I would rate this movie zero star if I can. Yup, one more thing, Jennifer Lawrence performance was actually OK. But it is obscured by the laughable lines and story telling."
" Worst
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen and the most boring movie I have ever seen. No other film has made hate its main characters more than this atrocity of a movie. The only thing miss Everdeen did was to cry and feel sorry for her beloved Peeta. However, I applaud the realistic depiction of a civil war. Some say that the strength of this picture lies exactly in not being a typical Hollywood blockbuster. But there are many Hollywood blockbusters that are good. Two of them are Avengers: Infinty War and Avengers: Endgame. Both of them are a perfect combination of action, suspense and emotion. Such movie, Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is not. The most boring film protagonist I have ever encountered. I literally regret wasting my time with this bs."
" The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,8,"Moving from the arena, this exert from the franchise focuses more on the larger game, and how the sum of small actions can grow to something much larger, whilst still following our main character. The themes of hope and fear become much more prevalent here, and lead to some of my favourite scenes in cinema - the dam and forest scenes. Editing becomes a larger part of this film over it's predecessors as we no longer just see the world through Katniss' eyes."
" Her sister is an idiot... Katniss is annoying!
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,5,"Can Katniss please stop hugging her stupid sister every time she does something completely stupid and detrimental? Doors are closing and the stupid girl runs back up to the sleeping quarters to get the cat because she ""couldn't live with herself"" if something happened to the stupid cat in the middle of an air raid!Katniss is extremely weak and pathetic in this part 1... sorry excuse for a leader, crying all the time and thinking emotionally. I couldn't stand her in this one.This Part 1 was very slow and boring... I had a hard time watching this one and not just playing on my phone out of sheer boredom."
" Boring
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,1,And how does she have such perfect hair ? 🙄Won't get to the end of part one. Certainly won't watch part two.
" Stretched out
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,6,"The Mockingjay book did not need to be split into two parts. It was already quite dull and empty, to be honest. This film suffers from the consequences of this decision because it is so stretched out and feels so empty. The tone of the story is a departure from the rest of the series as it focuses more on the political intrigue than the actual games, which helps to keep things fresh but it can also feel a bit dry."
" Mockingjay Part 1
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,8,"A week ago I loaded up the the first movie not expecting much, but was yanked into an interesting world. I am disappointed whenever I enjoy a movie and then I see it crapped on in the reviews of the users of this sight. Part of that may be the unfair vendetta against adaptations of popular books to film. In this case I have no basis to compare it to so my analysis is of the film alone.
Overall I think this is a good movie. I do not think I held up to the first two movies in the series that I have only recently watched. An I coming from the perspective of not watching the final installment.
I would like to start with the bad:
The main problem of the film is the ending, mainly stemming from the fact that it is an incomplete story split into two parts. Which is a common scheme of studios to maximize profits, but the studio can not take away all the good the talented people who work on films do that make many great elements.
The main problems with the end is the trap set by President Snow. From the time the rebel forces entered the building it was obviously a trap, and I think that it is a weak story mode from the President to let the team return with the victors, just for the chance of Peeta under the influence of some science fiction thing to kill Kantniss. (Though I think there may be room to redeem this element in the final installment).
Though the good thing is these are the only large issues with movie, but an ending to a movie is one of most important elements and can bring the movie down quite a bit.
Though it did do the same things the previous movie did well. Well acted. Great design. Good story. Well paced.
The main thing of all three movies as been the realism of a totalitarian government that is oppressive and suppressive of information.
Specifically this movie displays the start of a civil war and the unavoidable reality of destruction on both sides. It also displays propaganda on both sides.
I think that it has been a solid display of a love triangle, but I think I will wait until the next movie to make a final verdict.
Overall good movie, and I will watch the next one, which is a positive, the movie left me still wanting more."
" Young people exploited under utopia
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,6,"The protagonist for her sister to participate in the hunger games, but do not want her to become a rebellion fuse. She wanted only to be safe, but was helplessly involved in a mutiny."
" A Lackluster Follow-up to a Promising Franchise
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,5,"If Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2012) was an archetypal example of how to one-up an original movie and create an enthralling and captivating movie franchise, Mockingjay Part 1 is the all too typical way of crushing that excitement. What was shaping up to be a memorable franchise that would become logged in the public discourse and be mentioned in the same breath as Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia was unceremoniously extinguished by a completely lackluster third installment. Disappointing in many regards, it lacked so many of the things that made the first and, especially, the second movie so fun to watch. Whatever momentum the series had before this was lost in something that was simply a mediocre sequel.What made Catching Fire so good? It was the intense and unique action in The Games that never let you relax for a moment. It was the reliance on heavy hitting talent in Jennifer Lawrence, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Donald Sutherland. It was the beautiful imagery of The Capital and the contrast to the bleak existence in the cities. It was the sense of fulfillment in seeing an oppressed society rise up against its oppressors. Most of this was lost, or at least made bland and boring in Mockingjay Part 1.One of the most unfortunate critiques in this movie compared to the last is the fact that it is entirely generic and forgettable. It feels like you could plug this movie into almost any science fiction fight-against-the-man type of film series. Was this The Hunger Games or was it Maze Runner? Or was it Divergence? One could imagine a nearly identical course of events in almost any anti-establishment narrative. Clearly, the story couldn't just repeat the Hunger Games for a third time or it would become stale, but these are not the only things that make the world unique. You have the exorbitant extravagance of The Capital Citizens. There is the uniqueness of each of the 12 districts and how they interact with each other. There are the Gamemakers and their sleuthy, creative killing methods. All these things and more were forgotten in place of a plug-and-play rebel alliance story.Another disappointment was the onscreen chemistry of the actors and the lack of use of some amazing actors. In Catching Fire, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and Finnick (Sam Claflin) play a strong supporting role to Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), who puts in a masterful performance in being a broken, scared girl to growing up and accepting the challenge and becoming the heroic figure. Plutarch (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is an enigmatic wildcard with a sly smile who keeps us guessing. In Mockingjay Part 1, Lawrence gets very little time to shine. The intense action scenes which she does so well are few and far between. Hutcherson is rarely in scenes and when he is, his acting abilities are subdued. Hoffman is made to take a backseat as only a mere pawn in the grand scheme of things. And unfortunately, Julianne Moore (who plays President Alma Coin) put in a less than inspiring performance as the aspiring leader of a rebellious uprising.Catching Fire gave us a sense of purpose as audience members, when we could cheer for the gradual uprising in the districts mirrored by Katniss' success in The Games, both her physical defeats of Capital sympathizing stand-ins from the first districts, and her emotional grapplings with killing and its repercussions. Once we are introduced to District 13 and the underground rebellious movement, headed by Alma Coin, it seems to lose its luster. This is no longer Poncho Villa versus the oligarchical dictatorship, it's the Allies versus the Axis, a feeling of an even playing field. Gone is that feeling of an underdog that's building up to something special, led by an unexpected hero. Instead we jump-cut to the point where the Districts have an established military system and a next-in-line dictator who doesn't seem to care much about her people. It's a fight without a face and heel, just machine against machine.There is something that feels artificial about Katniss and her Mockingjay persona in this film. The film itself is almost a meta-critique of this. The Mockingjay is quite literally an artificial construct used by District 13 to inspire the rebellion. Katniss, however, wants to be genuine and passionate in the propaganda videos and has the opportunity to make grand speeches in the face of real crisis. However, even these moments of supposed truthfulness feel like a reenactment. This whole idea of having film cameras follow around Katniss, and especially the propaganda films they make, feel like something from a cheesy satirical comedy. It recalls images of ""I'm doing my part!"" from Starship Troopers (1997). Starships Troopers has the benefit of not taking itself too seriously, being purposefully lighthearted in contrast to the dark reality. Mockingjay Part 1, on the other hand, attempts to be only darkness, a bleak reality of war. Scenes with that comedic spin feels forced and out of place rather than tension breaking.In the end, what we all wanted this movie to be, and what the studio needed it to be, was a setup to the inevitable conflict and resolution in the final movie that we all already knew was coming. The audience should be on the edge of their seat in anticipation for the finale after watching this film. However, that feeling is not something I expect many people would be left with. Having split the final book into two parts, the film is left with many voids of space compared to the first two films which were so jam packed with action and plot progression it almost felt rushed. It is a slog to get through this, and the final film can only hope to compensate in some ways.Writing this review a few years after the movie was released, and looking back on it in retrospect, it seems unfortunate that the series has exited public consciousness for the most part. You never see Hunger Games themed toys at the store, and people don't usually bring it up in conversation. This pales in comparison to the extreme hype when the first film was released. Perhaps this is the natural progression of things, that a series should run its course and have its day in the sun. Not everything can last like certain stories. It is just disappointing to know that something that started with so much promise will end with a whimper and not a bang."
" NICE
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,7,"Surprise often appears inadvertently. Soon after the movie began, I was deeply attracted by the storyline inside. Thrilling storyline, naked exposed human nature, and noble love that never died made me remember this movie"
" It's worth it, but it's less interesting than the first films.
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,8,"This film is the third in the adaptation of the literary trilogy by Suzanne Collins, but, unlike the first two films, it brings only part of the last book to the cinema. I didn't read them, I have no particular intention of doing so for any particular reason, so I will ignore the books and focus on the film.In this film, we follow Katniss' first steps as a revolutionary. After being rescued from the arena and recovering from her injuries, she discovers that she is with a group of rebels, the same ones who allegedly lost the civil war seventy-five years earlier, the same ones who inhabit the supposedly extinct District 13. After all, everything was a lie. Everything was a manoeuvrer by Snow's regime to hide the existence of a strong movement of political contestation. Alma Coin, the head of the Resistance, asks for Katniss's support, wants her to become a symbol, a mascot. But she only thinks about the fate of her friends, especially Peeta, who is in Snow's power and seems to have been brainwashed.Well, after the second film turned out to be excellent it was difficult to do better, but it was totally possible to match it. I don't think that happened, although it is very close. This continues to be an excellent film and to be within a standard that does not clash or belittle the other two. I just don't seem to have managed to be that good. To begin with, I hate when a film based on a book splits into two halves, it is almost always a sign that there is immense straw that could be perfectly removed in an editing room by a skilled editor. The film, in fact, drags a little more than those that preceded it, but if the audience gets involved in the story it ends up not even noticing much. It is also a film that has a lot of sci-fi, the most focused on that genre in all of tetralogy.Jennifer Lawrence has remained excellent, but it brings nothing that we have not seen. In addition, attempts to create a romantic plot around her character are weak and cold, whatever the target of Katniss's interest. Donald Sutherland continues to surprise and now gives us an almost perfect villain, in his megalomania, narcissism and thirst for control and power. He is truly an exceptional actor, at his best. Stanley Tucci was much more serious and restrained in the way he brought Cesar, a sensationalist TV host, to life, but it reveals how his character is just a puppet of the regime. Elizabeth Banks is an actress who reveals herself in this film, thanks to the profound mental and psychological transformation that her character will undergo here, and Woody Harrelson gains strength and seriousness, as she becomes one of the most fervent supporters of ""Mockingjay"". Julianne Moore alternates between contained sweetness and charismatic strength and presence; Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright and Jena Malone are very good, but they don't do much more than they ask. Josh Hutcherson continues to sound weird, although in this film this is almost required by the character.In addition to a great cast and a good story, the film has excellent production values: careful cinematography with good contrast, excellent sets and costumes and great CGI and sound effects that make fights and combats seem like they want to get off the screen . The soundtrack also deserves special mention for its effectiveness and beauty. Composed by James Newton Howard, it is one of those that remains in the ear long after we have seen the film.Full of action and with an excellent story, this film is excellent, although it is not as engaging and intense as the film that preceded it. It drags on more, some scenes seem to be expendable, but that's what happens when, for money, a book unfolds in two films."
" War Comes to PANEM - ""If we burn, you burn with us"" Katniss Everdeen
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,8,"Katniss is now in District 13 where she is finding life increasingly difficult. The Rebel leaders want her to step up as the 'face' of the Rebellion - the 'Mockingjay' that the people of Panem have seen arena, but she is not in any mental condition to agree to this wish. In addition, the Capitol have now used Peeta in Propaganda media to tell the Rebels to lay down their arms. Katniss is suffering from PTSD and is confused. She refuses to play the 'Mockingjay' but Plutarch suggests that she be shown the ruins of her old District - 12 - during which Gale recounts what happened after the events in the arena - and the thousands that died in the firebombing. She reluctantly changes her mind and has a 'Propo' Team assigned to capture media shots for propaganda use. As the Districts flare up in open rebellion, Katniss goes to District 8, where she witnesses the effect she has on the people fighting - also the ruthlessness of Snow. Katniss also worries that, if Peeta does not succeed in bringing the rebels to the table, he will be executed, so forces the Rebel President - Alma Coin - to attempt a rescue of Peeta and the other remaining Victors held in the Capitol...
Of all the Films in this series, 'Mockingjay - Part 1' is consistently the one least liked - some people were critical of a 'Cash Grab' by the studio and of splitting the final Book into two Films. Having watched these many times, I have been a little perplexed as to how some people view them. Too many got caught up in the 'Games Arena' aspect of the first two and really just wanted a nice little simple jog to the finish with lots of explosions and action. But the author deliberately moved away from the 'Games' for the finale of the series.
I am very pleased that the filmmakers DIDN'T do this. Why? Firstly, 'Mockingjay' as a SINGLE Film would have been over 4 hours long - if cut, it would have lost all of the subtle character-driven scenes that make this story so gripping. But I believe that would have been a mistake. This entire story is about WAR - loss, sacrifice, trauma, death - the price of Rebellion. It is as well that 'Mockingjay - Part 1' IS a standalone film as it is the most gloomy, melancholy and devastating film of the series. It pulls no punches. It's 'Hero' - Katniss - begins the Film suffering a nervous breakdown (no 'superhero' nonsense here) and, subsequently, goes to see what has been done to District 12. She views the rubble and the blackened corpses in horror, collapsing to her knees as Gale tells her how he tried to save as many as he could from the capitol's firebombs. She returns to tell the Rebel Leader - Alma Coin - she will be the 'Mockingjay'. The scenes in District 8, where she visits the Field Hospital, are bloody and realistic. Bodies lying in corridors, badly wounded being treated on floors with rudimentary medical supplies and the stares of people suffering from the trauma of war. It is also where she is recognised. It is a lovely scene as slowly the whole room realise she is there....it is also where Katniss begins to recognise what she is to the Rebellion - Hope - a figure that took on the Capitol - and won. The stunned look on Lawrence's face is perfect - at last she is coming to terms with her role in all of this. She may never have wanted 'any of this' but she is now so deeply part of the Rebellion she cannot go back. Unfortunately, Snow knows she is there and despatches bombers - ordering them to target the Hospital. Katniss watches as the Hospital is utterly destroyed and, in rage, she and Gale, rush to a rooftop where the two Hovercraft are hit by them as they pass on a firing on - and crash in flames. Again, there are no punches pulled - Katniss - still enraged - shouts to Snow via her 'propo' Team ""If we burn, you burn with us"".
Later, while out with her 'Team', she stops in a quarry and is asked to sing. The melancholy song she chooses - 'The Hanging Tree' - sums up everything she feels. As she sings the scene cuts to a desperate 'human wave' attack by the people of District 7, trying to place explosives to destroy the Capitol's hydro-dams, source of power for the Capitol. Unarmed and simply absorbing bullets with flesh, the scene is simply stunning - no childish happy endings, no bullet-proof suits - just death for ordinary people. THIS is what it means to Rebel and fight oppression - and once again, 'Mockingjay' does this unflinchingly. It's depiction of a savage war, even though aimed at young adults, is extremely well done.
Meanwhile the Capitol continues to use Peeta to send messages to the Rebels - Katniss knows it is only a matter of time before Peeta is killed. Some have said that the 'romance' between the two is not realistic - but I differ from that. Katniss did NOT love Peeta immediately but gets to love him through the dreadful series of events they are forced to go through.
With the attacks on the Dams successful and with the power out, Coin sends a Team in by Hovercraft to retrieve Peeta and the others. Gale volunteers to go. It all seems far too easy as the Team penetrates the building and gets Peeta out. However, as they return the power comes back up - but they are not engaged and are allowed to return safely. Katniss is informed of the rescue but it is plain later as to why they were allowed to escape - Peeta has been completely 'brainwashed' by the Capitol - they have focussed all of his anger on Katniss and, when he sees her, he tries immediately to kill her. Katniss is only saved by the rifle butt of Boggs, the Rebel commander. The Film ends with Katniss, hardly able to speak and in a neck-brace looking with horror through a window at Peeta - who has had to be restrained as he is going berserk.
Firstly, the performance of Jennifer Lawrence is amazing - she carries this Film on her shoulders and does a fabulous job of portraying the tumult of emotions that the central character is going through. Likewise, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta has to step up in the acting stakes as his Character is also slowly being ripped apart and he does a great job of showing this disintegration.
At this point I should mention the superbly understated music by James Newton Howard. It is a very emotional score, the centrepiece of which is 'The Hanging Tree', which begins with just Lawrence's solo voice but slowly builds to a massive crescendo during the Dams attack.
Both Mockingjay - Part 1 and Part 2' - were shot at the same time. The second and concluding Part has a slightly different feel to it - Katniss is more mature, worldly-wise and even cynical.
Mockingjay - Part 1 may not be everyone's idea of a good time - it is an extremely dark Film in a series that needed to show the consequences of what happened in the first two Films. It is this Film which actually sets it apart from the other 'Young Adult' Film series that were released - none are as dark as this. Serious themes run all through the 'Hunger Games' series but never have these been more apparent than in this Film.
In a strange example of life imitating Art, some showings of 'Mockingjay - Part 1' were cancelled in Thailand when protestors began using the Rebels 'Three finger salute' when demonstrating against its Military Government!!
'Mockingjay - Part 2' will conclude the 'Hunger Games' story - in a melancholy and bittersweet way."
" I like this film very much, but one character almost ruins the plot
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,8,"I am not a fan way out there sci-fi stories with fictionalised cars and planes etc...I like to keep my films close to reality. However despite this I like this film very much. The lead actress carries the whole film and indeed the whole series of films, she is excellent. The story-line is fictional, however the main theory about a big elite power group is now emerging, so the basic lline of the film is well worth consideration for future generations. One of my main gripes is the character of Gale Hawthorne. The actor who plays him cannot act to save his life, his character is completely anachronistic and his character development is absolutely ludicrous, from poor, simple coalface miner to some kind of crack top elite forces leader of troops is so unreal and utterly unbelieveable. The character is so out of place it is as though someone else wrote his script and dropped his character in from afar. Despite Gale's character being idiotic and the acting much the same I rte this film 9/10"
" You've been cheated on people!
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,2,"This movie is nothing more but a filler between 2nd and 4th movie and a teaser for 4th movie. I'll admit it was very entertaining to watch because whole time I was hyped that something will happen, but nothing ever happened. This movie does it's job well as a teaser, it creates great hype for 4th movie and that's it. It has no rewatchability value, watching it second time would be torture since you know that nothing happens. Basicly, this is a threatical release of 2h teaser. In other words you just paid to see a teaser. This may be the best teaser I've ever seen, but it's nothing more. It should have been free and released as a promotional video for upcoming 4th movie."
" Good adaptation of the book
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,9,"The story is great but films don't always get it right when trying to adapt them to a film. However, the script-writing, acting and directing clearly were great for this film."
" The final acts Mockinjay
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,7,I loved the first two hunger games movies The Hunger games and Catching Fire. The sequel It continues to progress as follows the final movie. The Mockingjay the first half part of the Second film movie. I did mentioned before the previous reviews of the first two movies or to be more espasific on the second review Catching Fire. That the games will become more difficult and harder than that was then. This movie there is no whatsoever child play games intended. Now it raise up to difficult higher risks levels stronger leaders missions operations tactics. By the way I loved the song hanging tree from Katniss Everdeen and there revolution movement
" A Little Boring
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,7,"I had high expectations from this one but this quickly fizzled out. Honestly, the last Hunger Games book did not need two separate movies, so this one didn't really have a lot of progression. There wasn't much character development and not a lot happened really. It seemed like filler material and was incredibly slow. The actors were okay in their respective roles but I really thought it would be better since I had enjoyed the other movies in this series. I will continue on to the last film of the series to get some closure, but this was a one-time watch for me."
" Are you? Are you? Coming to the tree?
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"Bravo! This is the best film in the series so far! Everyone gives an amazing performance and there's not a single actor or actress in this film I felt should have been recast. The only problem I had in this film was the CGI. It didn't look realistic. It looked like the cutscene to a Playstation 1 game. The great thing about this film is it doesn't feel rushed. It takes it's sweet time in getting to the story, and that is cruical when the story is so big and needs a lot of character development. Why must I wait a year for part 2?! Why can't they just release it a month after the Blu-ray comes out? The Hunger Games movies just keep getting better and better. I'm excited to see how they handle part 2, and I'm highly confident it will be handled with care.
Grade: A-, 9/10, 4/5 stars"
" Boring and annoying
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,2,"This film could have been shorter, too long and boring with useless dialogues and almost no action at all. A waste of time and patience. Don't see it!"
" It's really not as bad as everyone says it is!!
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,8,Just watch it! If your reading this then you already have so make your own mind up or you are thinking about it I which case do!! It's good. I liked it!
" It would be so much better if there was only one film.
",2019-11-29 00:00:00,7,"First let me tell you the negative sides, they cut the film in two to make more money. The film is artificially elongated. It would be so much better if there was only one film. The film tells very well of its political concerns. A new tyrant emerges from those who fight against the tyrant. The rebels are portrayed as socialists and capitalists."
" Poor movie
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,2,Nothing to expect and noti to watch except young faces!!!
" To much
",2019-09-11 00:00:00,4,The story is ain't soomth and it is to slow for a movie
" Interesting universe with weak characters
",2019-08-27 00:00:00,6,"In the universe defined by the previous films, the story is now more focused on what is true in a system that is based on lies and illusions. This configuration of the society, Orwellian, deforms all human relationships and Katniss can be not more conscious of what Peeta is and thinks. So an atmosphere in all similar to the previous chapters (but with a movement toward the rebellion argument) is at the service of love story between Katniss and Gale or Peeta: the ambiguity of this strange triangle is very bad defined and the decisions of the main characters seem to be taken for contingent choices and can't react positively with the dystopian ambient. As the other films, good entertainment but with weak personalities and in general a movie rated really too much for what it really is: ""alternative"" commercial cinema."
" Prefer this over the first 2 movies, which is probably strange
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,8,"Well I liked this movie very much which I didn't expect as I didn't like Catching Fire for some reason. The plot was very good and kept me intrigued throughout the whole movie; it also was pretty straightforward, unlike the first 2 movies which could be confusing at times. It's probably my type of movie where it has good drama, which is probably why a lot of people reviewing don't like this movie as there's no games taking place, plus there's not much action compared to the first 2 movies, which I was fine with. This movie has made me really look forward to watch part 2 and I hope its just as good, if not better than part 1."
" Drags its feet
",2019-08-14 00:00:00,5,"It makes me sad that Philip Seymour Hoffman's last film is this. The first hunger games I could look past a lot of the issues like weird dialogue and bad acting and inconsistency. The second movie took me by surprise how good it was, and going into this I tried to think of it as a political war drama but... my lord. This movie is just bland. They gloss over so many things in this film. Like the camera placement being all over the place. Also, you know-how in the last film Katniss was all about defying the Capitol and saying what she means? Yeah in this film she starts out by refusing to be the one thing to take down the Capitol, all because they like... didn't save Peeta?This film also has so many unnecessary scenes. The two main ones being the hunting scene and the stairwell cat scene. They serve little to no purpose and don't invoke any real emotions at all. The action scenes at the end are done pretty well and it's very tense then but that pales in comparison to anything in the last 2 movies. Not to mention it's like watching paint dry for 45 minutes and then going on a roller coaster for 15. Not really worth it.I feel like the main appeal of the Hunger Games is two things. The actual games and lots of bloody combat, and Katniss as a character. Katniss doesn't do any growing in this movie and the little action there is doesn't feel like it was earned from the previous 45 minutes of the movie. Finally, my main problem with this movie is I feel like it wasn't needed. While the second movie is long I feel like it could have been worked into the second movie.Honestly, if you're doing a hunger games rewatch like I am skip this one."
" Don't fret, you can totally skip this movie
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,5,"Don't fret, you can totally skip this movie. Out of the 2 hour run time there is about 5 minutes of quality content. If you are a fan of the movie I would recommend fast forwarding to:
-Effie's reveal
-""The Hanging Tree"" Scene
-Rescuing the Victor hostages
-Katniss reuniting with Peeta
And yeah that's about it. You can sum up the whole plot of this movie in one sentence: Katniss lays low underground in District 13 while producing propaganda and fighting for Peeta's return. That's about it. There isn't really a plot. The cinematography is meh, just a lot of shots of underground bunkers. James Newton Howard's music is always nice. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson always kill it. However, splitting the last book into 2 movies was not a good move. First of all, the book wasn't even that good. I barely got through it, and I was a huge fan of the series. It's just boring. A political snooze fest. The whole film and most of the book is just sitting and talking.I'm being honest. If you skipped this movie and went right to Part 2 you wouldn't be lost at all. All you need to know is that District 12 is destroyed, they're in the secret District 13 now, and they just rescued Peeta and he's brainwashed to kill Katniss. You're welcome.I would only recommend this film to diehard Hunger Games fans. I gave it a 5 because of the music and acting."
" Tedious
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,4,"This franchise gets worse with each movie. This was especially tedious to get through, with Katniss acting like a petulant child throughout most of the movie. Honestly, this movie is entirely skippable."
" This is where things get real!
",2019-06-08 00:00:00,10,I loved the first two hunger games movies but this part one of a two part climax to the trilogy really took things to a new level. Everything from story to score to acting was just perfect. I loved how the world slowly got more revealed and the endgame realized. Following Katniss through her adventures has been one of the most enjoyable for me as a moviegoer.
" LOVED IT
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,8,"It's way darker than the previous ones, the whole bit about the rebellion and how they do it was amazing to me and so moving. I had goosebumps every single time they showed what the rebels are doing.Really good one, the entire series is great for my taste, wish we had more"
" Peeta this peeta that
",2019-02-26 00:00:00,5,I would've rate the movie higher if it wasn't for this continuous whining about Peeta. It is really annoying.
" unfortunately as a commercial film, this one should have at least a small climax
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,6,"Finally, the cushion before the climax, unfortunately as a commercial film, this one should have at least a small climax. Whether it's shooting planes, bombing dams, or the last lover's mutilation, it's almost meaningless. It also led directly to the failure of this episode. In addition, it is really found that Westerners'perception of the number of people is too shabby, no matter how grand the plot, can appear three or five hundred people is a big scene."
" Hanging tree
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,5,I believe the best part was the amazing song hanging treeThe rest was a mess but what do u do? If u have watched the first 2 u just need to watch the rest
" Dark story
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,6,"This part is different from previous part. Because, it's not games this time. It's just a war. Politics army v Resistant army. They hate each other. It's common sense with real world. Therefore, I don't so like this part."
" Boring
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,3,"This film is way too long for so little information. I almost fell asleep as I watched it.
Conclusion: Boring"
" Average set-up
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,5,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is a huge step down in quality compared to it's predecessors. The film is nothing more than dull set-up for the next one. However, it still has some redeeming qualities. Jennifer Lawrence gives a great lead performance as well as the rest of the returning cast, who all give good supporting performances. The film is well made and the CG is good."
" The terrors of war and suppression
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,7,"Many people misjudge this movie by comparing it with the book. Looking at the movie independently, I don't think of it as a bad movie. In my opinion its a very great movie that portrays amazingly well the gruesomeness and consequences of totalitarian regimen and how people rise up against their evil dominator and how rebellion is stoked. Both sides use clever propaganda to gain more followers or make the enemy loose hope and loose followers. Katniss has emerged as a symbol of hope and resistance against the Capitol. The movie shows us well how in war every decision made, might it be to save your friends or to create hope by broadcasting powerful speeches, will have a response from the enemy that could result in a loss of more supporters and casualties. It brings to the viewer a much a darker and realistic view on civil war, its terror and suppression as some other movies featuring the same thematic. The movie is a bit more reserved when it comes to action and battles, but focuses more on the psychological aspect."
" Once again, this series never fails to disappoint.
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,10,"It seems that as the series progresses, each movie becomes more scary, emotionally hard to take, and more complicated. I like how Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) progresses from a simple girl trying to save her sister to a symbol in a rebellion that could start a civil war. I also liked Peeta's (Josh Hutcherson's) progression in the interviews with Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) as he slowly tries to warn Katniss to think about what she is doing in terms of being a symbol in a revolution. Each character progresses in a different way, even Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks).Firstly, I would like to say that the acting is excellent. Jennifer Lawrence makes Katniss's fear for Peeta's life shine. As she sees the interview with Caesar Flickerman and realizes that Peeta is alive, she runs towards the TV screen and touches it. That is a sign that Katniss truly cares about Peeta at that point, which means that Katniss's love for Peeta becomes more real than it was in the 74th Hunger Games. It was easy to tell when the real Peeta shone through. The real Peeta always had watery eyes.I also could tell that Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) was probably against Alma Coin, (Julianne Moore) who is the president of the supposedly-obliterated District 13. I was actually second-guessing myself on this fact, because at one point, he seems totally on Coin's side. At other times, he seems to disagree.I liked the scene where Plutarch tries to convince Effie to stop feeling as if she's a prisoner. That was funny. I totally cracked up when Effie changed her mind by saying, ""There isn't a soul in here who knows the first thing about Katniss"" after Plutarch told her that he'll have to find someone else to be a part of Katniss's propaganda team.I also found it funny when Katniss listed her conditions to President Coin, ending with, ""My sister gets to keep her cat.""I was very excited when the rescue of Peeta, Johanna (Jena Malone), Annie (Stef Dawson), and Enobaria (Meta Golding) was initiated. I was anticipating Katniss's first meeting with Peeta since his capture, since I read the books first. The scene where Peeta chokes Katniss is MUCH more violent than in the book. In the book, Peeta just puts his hands around Katniss's throat. In the movie, he first shoves Katniss against a glass structure, and she breaks it. Then, Katniss falls to the ground and Peeta attempts to choke her. Because Katniss's face actually turned red, I wonder whether Josh Hutcherson actually had to choke Jennifer Lawrence while filming.The last scene is scary and emotional the same time. I felt my eyes growing bigger as Peeta tried, violently, to break the straps that held him down while screaming. I felt so bad for Katniss when she was staring in shock at what the Capitol had done to Peeta.Guide: Recommended for 14 and older, no cuss words, and emotionally hard to take. Peeta screaming as he tries to break free from his restraints might be disturbing to younger kids."
" Me and my son Muhammad enjoyed this blatant ripoff of the Japanese classic: Battle Royale 2: REQUIEM.
",2018-12-04 00:00:00,1,"War movies have always been a favourite genre for me, and in Mockingjay we get war in all it's horror and heroism all tied into a comprehensive and intelligent bundle that is carried effortlessly by Jennifer Lawrence. The direction keeps us focused on Lawrence, she is in 95% at least of the scenes and she dominates. Her portrayal of Katniss as a damaged, fragile and very young girl who is also the main prop of a rebellion against horrific oppression is spellbinding.The fact that the script makes no concessions to the action junkie is IMO at least, only to be commended. The rest of the cast seem to have been inspired by her formidable work. Everybody has raised their game to match her, I can not think of a weak link in the rest of the cast's. performances. Liam Hemsworth at last make Gale real. There are too many really to list here. Stand outs for were Josh Hutcherson's Peeta,. Elizabeth Banks Effie, Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch and of course Donald Sutherland's Corialanus Snow. A great story needs a great villain and his Snow is both fascinating and repellent.And on a final closing note, this film makes the eternal whining of the. so-called Battle Royale 2: Requiem 'fans' look more pathetic than ever and leaves you scratching your head wondering what film they saw."
" THE HUNGER GAMES : MOCKINGJAY PART 1
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,10,"Don't say your not hungry because this movie is dystopic and with pleasure it is like ""LOST"" the television premier."
" It starts in the middle of a story and it ends in the middle of a story
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,6,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is not a standalone film. It starts in the middle of a story and it ends in the middle of a story, and, frankly, there's not much to this story. This movie is filler to get to the finale. It also doesn't give Jennifer Lawrence much to do aside from stare at things and say ""Peeta"" over and over again. It's not a bad movie, it's just not a complete movie."
" HorseCrap
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,2,I do not like this movie there is just a bunch of moments that make the film not enjoyable. the bunker scene goes on for too long as does many scenes in the film.The main problem with it is that it just throws exposition after exposition at you just to try and to help you understand the incoherent mess that is the story.The music and the dialogue makes me feel tired which is something a film especially a action film like this should not have to do. If you like the film you may enjoy this but even though its competent I can't enjoy this film in paticular.
" Kids of slow, but still good...
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,7,"The movie starts off kind if slow and boring with you not really knowing what's going on. It takes its time explaining the situation at hand, and eventually gets down to it about half hour onto the movie, Peeta's is gone but is going psychotic. Katniss is depressed but wants to help, so the good and bad guys start blackmailing each other. In the end they leave you wondering what will happen next which I suppose is the point."
" Meh
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,3,"This ranks with the Last Jedi, should have stopped at 2"
" KISS HER, KILL HER, BE HER
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,10,"First off, this is part of a series. If you haven't seen the previous films (or read the books) you will be hopelessly lost. There is no flashback to bring you up to date.This film picks up where the last one leaves off. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is recruited to be the face of the rebellion. She is reluctant until it becomes personal. Happy content people don't pick fights. The film consists of a propaganda war between Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and the government and Katniss and the rebels/terrorists/anarchists/freedom fighters. It finishes on an up note...sort of.The film delves into the problems of a rebellion and the need for a war of words to convince hearts and minds. In many ways I like this film more than the previous ones, especially the second one which was just a filler film to get us to the rebellion. I think of the second film as ""Star Wars Episode 2"" but less annoying. My apologies to the president of the Jar Jar Binks fan club.In this film, I now see why Jennifer Lawrence was needed for the series as she transforms from reality TV star to a person who runs a gauntlet of emotions: fear, despair, terror, panic, hopelessness, and pretending she can't act. Clearly she nailed it as only she can.The film had a number of memorable lines:""My sister gets to keep her cat."" was great. It demonstrates that the rebellion is about her personal life and that it takes priority over any cause...for better or worse.""Best dressed rebel in history."" Shows some mindless priorities.""Prepare to pay the ultimate price.""And with sadly Philip Seymour Hoffman says, ""Anyone can be replaced.""Katniss takes a crossbow to a gun fight. It makes for good fiction, but seriously?If you have seen the other two, you are going to watch this one too.Guide: No bad language, sex, or nudity."
" one of the most Boring movie ever made!
",2018-05-04 00:00:00,6,"Seriously, i was waiting for some action or story development throughout the movie but i didnt get one. 2 hours of dull drama in the sci-fi set."
" Fire burns brighter in the darkness...
",2018-04-24 00:00:00,8,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay-Part 1, follows Katniss Everdeen as she wakes up after the events in the arena and finds herself in the broken district thirteen. Katniss struggles to become the rebellions mockingjay figure that she feels she can't be. Mockingjay-Part 1 may seem boring at first since there's not much to this film. The film is not as suspenseful and thrilling, though the events in the film are shocking and the decisions made will get you thinking. As you watch the film it will get interesting and will have you hoping for a good outcome from the whole situation that the characters struggle to come out of as they are constantly reminded that its the things we love most that destroy us.""I have a message for President Snow. You can torture us and bomb us and burn our districts to the ground. But do you see that? Fire is catching... And if we burn... you burn with us!""-Katniss Everdeen, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay-Part 1"
" A cheap money grab.
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,3,"For my review of these two movies, I'm going to be treating them as one movie and copy/pasting this review onto both movies. The only reason why this movie was split into two is because the studio wanted to make money. There is no other logical reason for this nonsense. Plot - This movie isn't very interesting or compelling. The first half is all filler while the second half is a series of semi-violent sequences of poorly choreographed action in between more boring filler. For the most part these movie are very predictable. Anything that is unpredictable is only made so due to the level of stupidity involved. I'm not sure if I can stress enough how much of this movie is boring filler. Characters - None of the actors really care anymore. The guy who plays Haymitch is still enjoyable, but he's a minor character. The characters are all as boring and idiotic and simplistic as they always were.Cinematography - The whole look of this movie is just as bad as the previous movies, but at some points its even worse. There isn't really anything to say about this movie. Its just a load of boring, predictable nonsense."
" ...
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,5,Pretty lifeless and boring with some entertaining parts
" Emotional and intense
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,9,"Fantastic film. Brilliant addition to the series even as part 1 of 2. Mockingjay has dispensed with the killing games of the 1st two instalments in favour of war, political power plays and the beginnings of a rebellion. There is also an underlying theme highlighting the power of the media and it's influence in such matters. This one is intense and really packs an emotional punch - aided by some excellent direction and some great acting from the lead players. It is sad to have the knowledge that we have now lost a talent like P.S. Hoffman - his Plutarch is a wonderful exercise in subtlety and intellectual prowess. An interesting match against the power of the capital, with it's abundant troop numbers and heavy firepower. He is a gifted strategist and the one who seems to really know what is going on. Jennifer Lawrence is excellent once again as Katniss. It is clearer now (than in the 1st two films) why she had been picked for this as she really makes you believe the up and downs of this difficult journey, and you are with her for every step. Some of the heart wrenching scenes/speeches (one early one in particular) may have fallen flat in the hands of another actress. I found myself completely engrossed for the entirety of this film, not wanting to take my eyes off the screen for any of it. As I said previously, this is heavy on the emotion and it rarely lets up. Even with little knowledge of the intricacies of the back story and history of Panem, you are wholeheartedly behind the rebellion and you so fervently despise the man behind the suffering. Sutherland hasn't had much screen time in any of these films but credit to him to still make you loathe the Snow character and his relaxed attitude to the genocide of entire cities of people. It's a pity that this film had to be split in 2. It's annoying to have to wait so long for a conclusion. I am deducting a star purely because it feels unfinished. However, considering this is based on fiction for young adults...it still hits hard and will stay with me for a while."
" THE HUNGER GAMES IS BACK AND BETTER THEN EVER! though some people disagree on the films tone
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,10,"THE HUNGER GAMESMOCKINGJAYPART 1why? people really don't like this film i'll tell you why. people didn't like the mockingjay films, because of the lack of action katniss being less powerful then in the first 2 and a lot of propaganda BUT mockingjay is a war film and would have things to do with torture, PTSD and propaganda that is what the main theme of the mockingjay films are about. anyway, i'll tell you my opinion. its gritty tone and music suits the film perfectly 10/10
The Propoganda and war feel we get when watching the film is perfectly done, intense and hard to watch, but at the same time great. and the uprising of the Districts. 10/10it's direction great! Francis Lawrence is an amazing director and always will be, it's gritty tone really sits with you throughout the entire movie.the acting in the film is also really strong just like catching fire and hunger games I really mean it, it is some of the best acting I've seen and the films have some of the best actors I've also seen in other films!Overall, I love the film because it tells a very realistic story with great visuals, great acting, great cinematography, superb music and fantastic directing i give this film a 10/10 its very realistic and gritty and violent.Just as a warning I felt physically sick during the film, mainly because of how harrowing it was.Now taking all things into consideration, I suggest that you should watch this film, simply because of how great it is. It's my favourite of THE HUNGER GAMES films, and I will definitely be watching them again! :D"
" Less Action more Politics
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,10,"""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"", continues on the franchise from where ""Catching Fire"" left off. ""Mockingjay Part 1"" being Part 1 of a 2-part story it obviously not going to be the fastest paced film. This being said the story didn't feel like it dragged on and was still a fantastic entry to the franchise. Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived. She awakens from the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell deep inside the hunkered catacombs of District 13. Separated from some of her closest allies and fearing for their safety in the Capitol, Katniss finally agrees to be the Mockingjay, the symbolic leader of the rebellion. Still uncertain as to whom she can trust, Katniss must help 13 rise from the shadows, all the while knowing that President Snow has focused his hatred into a personal vendetta against her-and her loved ones. ""Francis Lawrence"", the director of this film, once again directs it very smoothly and differently in the fact that there are no games in this one. He takes advantage of the sets to make them as useful as possible and he takes a smart turn with this one. The acting from ""Jennifer Lawrence"" is once again amazing with a lot more emotional scenes put on her. Although ""Josh Hutchersons"" character doesn't have much screen time he defiantly redeemed himself from his previous attempt with Peeta Mellark in ""Catching Fire"". The last lead is ""Liam Hemsworth"" but his look on his character, Gale Hawthrone, makes him seem like a very boring and self centered character, although its not ""Liam Hemsworths"" fault that his character seem self centered he defiantly plays a role in it. ""Sam Claflin"" is back playing his character Finnick Odair but his character doesn't have much screen time, saying that ""Sam Claflin"" does make use of his time. Although the characters in this film are mostly the same as the last two films there are a couple more characters introduced. One of them include President Alma Coin who is the leader of District 13. They mostly leave her character in the dark to make her seem on Katniss' side. But Katniss doesn't really know who's side she's on. Another new stand out character of the film is Cressida, who is part of Katniss' camera team. The returning characters have massive character development through the film especially Katniss and Peeta. Another great part of this film is the score composed by James Newton Howard, although there aren't so many great songs in it the ones that are great, I mean are really really great. Obviously having less action in this film you would think it would need less special effects. Wrong. The film had a high budget of an estimated $125 Million. Most of this probably went into the set design of District 13, but if you think about it they can't build a whole civilization underground in three months. So what does this mean they have to use. Special Effects and my god you can't even tell if the characters are standing in front of a green screen. Another place they succeeded in in the special effects department are the action scenes. Including the District 8 bombing and the Hanging Tree Action sequence. The only issue I had with this film is a small pacing issue in the beginning. It didn't drag on but it did have a couple of filler scenes near the beginning, but if you took them out some of the movie wouldn't make sense so I guess they should've made those couple of scenes different from the book which it stayed true to. Overall ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" was a very good entry to the fantastic ""The Hunger Games"" Franchise with once again smooth directing and spectacular acting from most of the cast. It had great character's, a good score, amazing special effects but it did have small pacing issues near the beginning. I give 2014's ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" a 9.5/10."
" latter day Joan of Arc
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,5,"As it turns out, I'm here because I won a competition for writing a review on a local site, and the first prize was a complete box-set of THE HUNGER GAMES, all four movies in a big square decorated carton container, and, oh yeah, a date with the lead actress, the one that played Katniss, uh Jen something. The date went well, but that is not what I am here to brag (er, talk) about.* THE HUNGER GAMES weren't on my to-do list, I consider lots of movies featuring pretty actresses, but the premise didn't exactly appeal. Of course, the opportunity to win it for free for very little effort I took on ""like that"" and to cut a long story short, I have been watching, first the kick-off, then the sequel, and now, here is the... tired re- hashing?People, you have to get off this big franchise thing. It's that old ROCKY X joke, the fans would go watch Rocky until he's in a wheelchair, with dentures and failing eyesight. Go on to something new!This was basically my line of thought as I was watching the first half. This Joan of Arc kinda story-line. Then came that air raid on the hospital, and suddenly, I am with the die-hard fans of the series. That sequence I rate full marks. Doesn't change the fact that the movie plods on through about 45% of its running time as one big yawn, not so much for nothing much happening, but for me NOT CARING... And this movie played to eager fans... swarms of them... there must have been disappointment caused by the slow progress. You lose fans that way. They walk out of theaters disillusioned, and spread the word of their disappointment, or switch off television sets. Get the picture? Like I said, it does get better. But first impressions count, and the movie starts off dismal and continues that way for far too long. Of course the fans expected outdoor competition, and got claustrophobic bunkers.Willow Shields, the young actress playing Prim, seemed to hold so much promise in the original. But, no, big letdown performance from her. It's like that stuck-with-the-cast curse of TV, the first time round they might fit in perfectly, next season they're just blah!Treading on many toes now, but Philip Seymour Hoffman, I fail to see anything standout in his final role. Including CATCHING FIRE.Liam Hemsworth has considerable leading man charm, that other guy, Josh whatever, can go home! The Mockingjay logo is the real star of the entire movie, especially after sitting through ten minutes (or more?) of end credits.The uglification of the characters (and their hick names, yee-ikes, the ugliest names, Haymitch Abernathy sounds like a hillbilly goat farmer and Plutarch Heavensbee... oh good grief...) Okay, what I was going to say, on the DVD, the cast appears, and everybody looks a hundred times better than they do in the movie. Basically, this is a movie with loads of unattractive, weird and dorky characters. Except J-Law and Liam, of course.All in all, there's another reviewer here who's tag-line reads ""two hour movie could have been edited into 20 minutes"" or something like that. I agree. There is a pervasive tedious feeling to this movie.Must have cost the franchise a lot of fans. Burst bubbles...*something in this review is just a lie, but I'm keeping my trap shut. You figure out what it is."
" Went in with cynicism, came away unsurprised
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,5,"So The Hunger Games follows the lead of Harry Potter and – its own spiritual nemesis – Twilght, and splits its final chapter in half. The result is not surprising.After the events of the trilogy's second act, Catching Fire, Katniss wakes up surrounded by new allies with dubious motives. She desperately wants to rescue Peeta, who has been taken by the tyrannical Capitol, but her allies want her to become a symbol of strength and hope for the downtrodden Districts.Compared to the first two films, this one feels like the most grim, realistic interpretation of the themes involved. Mockingjay Part 1 is a bleak, visually monotone and narratively reserved; there are lots and lots of visuals depicting death and destruction, we see heroine Katniss standing in a field of burnt bodies and skulls, we have executions and brainwashing to drill into our heads that The Capitol are vicious. Wow. I never would have thought I would say that, the incompetent villains are actually evil here, we actually get a real sense of uncompromising tyranny that could rule over millions of lives. The threat is finally real, and there's a sense that Katniss really must choose, that her fate is now entwined with the fate of all the Districts.But this whole cutting the chapter in half nonsense continues to not work. My prevailing memory of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 are those of stale, dull, elongated moments (mostly camping in the forest), and Mockingjay Part 1 is no different. Scenes are stretched, padded and unnecessarily quiet and dull. When watched in a vacuum this only makes the persistent thought of ""this isn't going to conclude"" all the more apparent. Most of the film is about Katniss trying to get over tension and shock to become the poster girl for a rebellion. There little to no combat or action, because this is only the first and partly second act of a complete film.I boycotted this film's release on principle: the first two films had uneventful segments, and if they boost that uneventfulness into one entire movie, I will be both bored and unsatisfied. While the film didn't quite bore me as much as I thought it might, it was as unsatisfying as I expected.Perhaps the best part of this film is the twisted dynamic between Katniss and Peeta. While it does not have the same power as Catching Fire's celebrity gossip themes, it is this film's greatest asset. Although I do have a soft spot for stories that literally corrupt heroes.The Capitol finally have fangs, and the film benefits tremendously from the late Philip Seymour Hoffman and newcomer Juiliane Moore, Jennfier Lawrence too maintains her multi-layered Katniss very well and there's a good sense of continuity with Catching Fire. But I refuse, I refuse to believe this is better as two parts. A screenwriter worth his or her salt could compress this into a single film, perhaps the longest film in the series but at least that's not the ridiculous cash grab that is two incomplete films.Each Lord of the Rings book was a single film!I went into Mockingjay Part 1 with cynicism, and unfortunately it didn't change my overall opinion enough. Sure, I fully admit I am too old for this series (if I were thirteen I'd be all over it, and completely smitten by Ms Lawrence) and if I were a fan I'd be chewing my own arm off to see the conclusion. But in terms of singular films, which this must be rated as, it is nothing spectacular."
" Third in the series is a total bore from beginning to end
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,2,"THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY - PART 1 suffers from exactly the same problem as HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS: PART 1; it's an adaptation of the first half of a book in which very little happens, the calm before the climax if you like. So instead of plot movement you get an absolute ton of exposition, flashback, and general scenes of Jennifer Lawrence moping around in the most objectionable way ever.This is just as poor as the previous movie in the series, despite the amount of famous faces popping up in minor supporting roles and the wealth of CGI and effects used to bring a futuristic society to life. Instead of getting on and leading the rebellion, Lawrence instead grieves for her lost love, held prisoner by the other side. Whenever you see Josh Hutcherson's eminently punchable face you wonder what all of the fuss is about. It's a film with no beginning, middle, or end, over-obvious throughout, simply treading water before the last in the series. In other words, it's a total bore."
" Another Great Installment
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,8,"This movie us another great installment in The Hunger Games Series. It continues the story very effectively. While it is not as action packed as the first two, it is riveting nonetheless. It deals with much of the emotional baggage and PTSD suffered by Katniss. I have no idea what movie the person who gave it a 1 was watching. But don't believe his/her review. I generally do not watch movies that are geared more towards teens through 20 year old but this is great books and the movies are vry tiveting. It is well worth taking a weekend and bindge watching all movies in one day."
" Just Like The Book; The Weakest Of The Bunch
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,4,"Back a year or so ago when I was reading the Hunger Games books, I considered ""Mockingjay"" to be the weakest of the trilogy...and it wasn't even really close (IMHO). I was hoping that this film version (much like how I though the ""Catching Fire"" movie was actually better than its piece of literature) would ignite more of a spark with me. As evidenced by the three-star rating, it did not. ""Mockingjay Part One"" is not a bad movie, but it just happens to be based on the weakest book in the series.For a basic plot summary, this movie begins with Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) having been yanked from the Quarter Quell. She is now in the mysterious District Thirteen, where President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) is the leader of a rebellion aimed at overthrowing President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the Capitol by uniting all the districts. In order to do this, Coin needs Katniss to relent to be the Mockingjay, or a powerful symbol of the rebellion. The problem? Katniss is more interested in reuniting with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who is now a pawn in Snow's counter-scheme (but is he WILLING pawn, that is the big question). After consulting with Gale (Liam Hemsworth), Plutarch (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and even Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), Katniss decides to take up the mantle. Of course, she cannot possibly imagine the consequences this decision may have on her future.Like I said, this isn't a terrible film. Director Francis Lawrence knows how to direct this series, and he understands how to get the most out of the material. The problem in this case IS the material. More specifically, the character of Katniss. In previous films/books, Katniss is the strong, central hero around which the entire plot revolves. In ""Mockingjay"", though, I felt like the source material takes great leaps/liberties with her character to suit the story. For example, in previous material she can't stand the ""pomp and circumstance"" surrounding her costumes and status. In this one, she immediately falls in love with her mockingjay costume and quickly steps forward as a figurehead. I know this is all supposed to be driven by her mad love for Peeta, but was that relationship really developed enough to truly make it seem believable?Part of my ""problem"" with this film too, though, could be that I am a male adult. I am not the target (i.e. young adult) audience. The material of the Hunger Games is meant to suck in teen and young adult readers, first and foremost, with the ""big ideas"" appealing more broadly. By the time ""Mockingjay"" came around, however, the big ideas are running out, which means the love- triangle focus must narrow. So, a lot of it depends on how much you can ""buy in"" to the teen romance.Overall, this is more of an ""incomplete"" grade than anything. I fully expect the second part to be much, much better once the action can really progress to its conclusion. But I can't give the studios a pass on their money-grab either. This movie did not NEED to be split into two parts, but was only done so to extend the hype surrounding the franchise."
" Two hours of bland and over-stretched set-up
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,4,"As said with the first two 'Hunger Games' films (which had its plus points but didn't do much for me), the books are fun, scary, thrilling and moving though because being so rich in detail and characterisation they are difficult to adapt.Generally the films, while all with their good points, don't do them justice, following the basic details but with the spirit watered down to blandness and the characters nowhere near as fascinating. Judging the films on their own terms is to me a fairer way to judge though, and will be done here because they are problematic on their own. Of the four films (which all have good points but just as enough problems that stop me from caring for them much), 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part I' is the weakest, it feels too much like set-up and set-up that's very tame and really struggles to justify its length.There are certainly good things. The production values, some dodgy special effects aside, are very well done with the nightmarishly dystopian production design faring best, it's lit with atmosphere and luckily the cinematography and editing is not the sloppy and frenetic kind seen in the first film. The score is thrilling and emotive, and there are some good performances here. This is particularly true of a terrific Jennifer Lawrence, dastardly Donald Sutherland, moving Philip Seymour Hoffman, smarmy Stanley Tucci and classy Julianne Moore.Not all the cast work. Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson are still lacking charisma and expression, while Elizabeth Banks (a high point of the first film) and Woody Harrelson have nothing to do.Lack of character development and halfway-decent writing plays a large part here. The characters had a lot of meat to them before but here are pretty bland stereotypes with non-existent development or direction, Katniss excepted. Didn't find myself caring for the relationship between Katniss and Peeta, mainly because of Peeta being written and played so blandly but also the chemistry didn't seem to be there. The writing does feel under-cooked, with some cringe-worthy moments and lacks edge or any kind of emotion a lot of the time.'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay-Part I' could have easily been shorter, because the story feels far too thin and over-stretched which makes some scenes interminably dull and dreary. The film is basically set-up and after finishing on a note every bit as abrupt as the ending for 'Catching Fire' it feels like set-up that doesn't lead or go anywhere. Atmosphere-wise, it just feels rather tame in alternative to tense and leaden rather than edgy. The direction is pretty pedestrian here.In summary, bland and over-stretched despite some good performances, production values and music. 4/10 Bethany Cox"
" Enough of Katnis Everdine
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,3,"Katnis Everdine is really, really starting to rub me up the wrong way. Sure, she is really good with a bow (and also seems to have the ability to magically bring arrows back into her quiver after firing all of them at a bunch a ravenous apes), but she also seems to be very prim, proper, and nothing like the rebel that everybody makes her out to be. Okay, I guess the whole idea is that she is supposed to be the reluctant hero, but as far as I'm concerned she really doesn't come across to me as being all that heroic. In fact after finishing this movie I had literally become sick of the sight of her, which is disappointing because she does play Mystique in the X-men really, really well.Anyway, this film follows on from the previous one, after the rather annoying cliff hanger where it turned out that half of the people in Capital, including one of John Snow's closest confidants, turned out to be rebels, and that there has been a rebel movement building for quite a while. However, the mysterious district Thirteen, which was only mentioned once in the previous films, and was said to have been destroyed, turns out to be the rebel base. Mind you, as soon as you are introduced to this place, and their leader Coin, you, or at least I, raised the question as to what was so different here than there was elsewhere. Particularly since the so called rebels had this habit of kidnapping people that Katnis trusted.So, what we have are the rebels wanting to use Katnis, the reluctant face of the rebellion, to film a number of propaganda videos – tell me again how these rebels differ from the rest of Panem? The problem is that Katnis turns out not to be all that good an actor, which was strange because she was a really good actor when it came to pretending to be in love with Peter, but then again we sort of wonder whether she actually is in love with him or not. So, they decide to go out to the war zone where she can be herself, and then use this as an opportunity to film the videos.Oh, I should also mention that Peter, and some others, were captured by the Capital and are being used in propaganda videos of their own, so the rebels send in an elite strike force – of which Katnis isn't allowed to participate because, well, she actually isn't a warrior, she is just the human face of the rebellion. I am sort of wondering whether I should say anymore, but I won't because, well, I can't be bothered."
" A total ripoff of Japan's BATTLE ROYALE 2: REQUIEM.
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,1,"Many have said this before, but I'm afraid I have to repeat the opinion on the account that a surprising many have decided that The Hunger Games is worth of anything more than 1 star in IMDb. The Hunger Games is a unscrupulous photocopy of the masterpiece BATTLE ROYALE 2: REQUIEM, and should be avoided, if not boycotted.Some will claim that The Hunger Games is a 'tribute' or a 'remake' of the BATTLE ROYALE. To them I ask one question: ""What kind of filmmakers make remakes of a movie when the original came out two years ago and has been selling DVDs very well internationally?"" It seems that this particular brand of Indian cinema has decided that it is quite content making money off of other people idea for free. And though it is impossible for the original filmmakers to sue the filmmakers of The Hunger Games (on the account that US copyright laws does not allow for such suit), The Hunger Games should be remembered as a true stain on the development of American Cinema.Because it has photocopied a great movie, The Hunger Games avoids being an absolute terror of a movie. However, this does not excuse Gary Ross and the section of 'Bollywood' that has involved itself in The Hunger Games's production. Because of the blatant plagiarism, and the The Hunger Games's makers absolutely refusing to apologize and reimburse the original filmmakers, I must say The Hunger Games deserves 1 star, if not 0."
" dragging on...
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"This movie tries hard, and it does what it can, but I agree with the reviewers that this is getting a little retread. I think the stories are good, but this can only be done with so much, and it does lead well into the ""second sequel"" as Catniss does battle with old and new tormentors and features new scenes and scenarios for the Hunger Games. You will need to have seen the previous two movies to get this one. It's an OK film for action film fans and fans of the series. Once again, Jennifer Lawrence turns in a terrific performance, and there are lots of good action scenes and a decent plot. It's a pretty good timekiller.** out of ****"
