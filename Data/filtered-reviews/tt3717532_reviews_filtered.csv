" Super Good!!
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,10,I would never stop watching this!!If your into romance than this is a movie to definitely watch but Watch all of naruto first!!Its such a good movie I don't see what is there to dislike when there's so much to enjoy!!😊I love Naruto and Hinata
" A beautiful conclusion!
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,9,"People might have polarizing opinions about this movie, but for me personally I don't have a problem with how they have shifted the overall narrative of Naruto from action to romance, though this film is not at all short on action. Looking at the chronological order, the events in this story occur after the war just before the final 4-5 episodes of Shippuden which has the Naruto wedding arc. Hinata is a girl I have rooted for since the Naruto season 1 days. She loved the least cared about boy in the class from the very beginning and ends up with the strongest man in the 5 nations and a war hero. I also love how Naruto matures over the course of the movie; being the usual goofball who is too dense to understand Hinata's feelings towards him but realizes it after seeing her dreams and hopes how her love is pure and unadulterated ever since they were kids. Every guy should have a girl like Hinata by his side and this movie is a testament to that! For those who have seen Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, I would definitely recommend this movie and for those who haven't, I would 100% recommend watching Naruto and Naruto Shippuden and this movie! Its a beautiful end to a beautiful saga and even though Boruto in ongoing, I am sad to see this story end!"
" Best Naruto movie
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,9,This is for me by far the best Naruto movie ever made. I'm not a fan usually of love story but this one was really well made.
" This is actual trash
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,1,"This movie is actual trash written by a non-fan with a Hinata fetish. The animation looks pretty at times and is the only reason this movie gets even a 1 star, because the entire plot defies logic and canon. If you actually take Narutos point of view into consideration at all he is a teen boy peer pressured into dating a girl he's never canonically showed any romantic interest in, and the total disregard for his thoughts and feelings makes this entire movie genuinely uncomfortable to watch. All I can say is if the genders were reversed the ratings would be a lot less. But sure why not retcon and ignore his feelings if it gives us a gateway into a pathetic sequel."
" Love it!
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,9,Loved that Naruto ended up with Hinata... Loved the subtleties in the movie...
" Well animated and somewhat good story
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,5,"Well i'm not the biggest Naruto fan in the world. the best part of the tv-series is when they are young and not so over powerful.Going intio this movie u had no hi hopes but ... great animation and score ! The story was somewhat good and somewhat less good . But as i staded before the big fights i have no love for so the nine tails fight was not good and boring .Its an ok movie and I actually teared up in the End , sweet !"
" Perfect Epilogue!
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,10,"This movie is the perfect epilogue for the series, thanks Kishimoto sensei <3"
" Good
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,10,This was such a good movie for my first anime I recommend watching this
" The best conclusion ever happen
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,10,True ending of very long and very intersting naruto generation.
" Just a great movie !!!
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,9,"I can't Say anything but it was really a lovely movie!
They showed us the great love between hinata and naruto just the way we imagined .
If you just finished watching naruto shippuden series I recommend you to watche it , you are gonna love it ."
" great watch !
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,9,"The movie is great! Don't get me wrong I do understand why the movie is getting a lot of hate for this is a Naruto movie and people will surely be expecting a lot of action from the main characters especially team 7. Though what we can see in the movie is more of our boy Naruto trying to settle down with his wifey Hinata. This is not bad for it is actually cute how the story goes. You wouldn't really get entirely disappointed for the lack of action from other main characters but animations for the fight scenes are not bad; looks really cool if I would be honest and animations are smooth. Overall, it is really good watch for the fans and I can say it is fitting that it's actually the last episode for Naruto. (Knowing that there would be Boruto for its sequel.)"
" Increasingly silly plot makes ""The Last"" hard to recommend.
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,6,"Though I don't believe they'll actually spoil the movie for anyone, this movie is so dumb I find it impossible not to include some examples so I have used the spoiler warning just to be safe.Drawn in a style similar to Shippuden (good if you like that style, not-so-good if you don't), the increasingly silly plot (villain is going to destroy the Earth with the moon) makes it very hard to recommend ""The Last"".Despite the entire Earth, not to mention one of his companions, being in peril, we don't see Naruto powering up until the final act, but only because the villain powers up first, at which point the moon is promptly cut perfectly in half. the same moon they are fighting on the surface of (it's even dumber when you see it).Action-wise, though not as good as the other movies or series (but also not pointlessly drawn out over several episodes), ""The Last"" mostly delivers what Naruto fans are looking for, and it's on that basis alone that I give ""The Last"" a barely passing grade."
" Boooooooo
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,2,"It was so bad, I couldn't even enjoy it as a guilty pleasure. I mean direct-to-DVD Disney sequel-caliber AWFUL. Its single redeeming quality is its animation, as per us with mediocre anime titles. But even the visuals (use of color/composition/lighting) were pretty ""meh"".As for the bad, I'm not really sure where to begin. The dialogue was translated from Japanese, so I wasn't exactly expecting a Tarantino, but dear Lord, what we got was inexcusable. Do they deliberately seek out autistic hermits to script their character interactions?? Because the conversations in this film are stilted to where I'd believe that's the case. In fact, they're barely conversations at all...it's just the characters explicitly narrating the themes and events of the story. ""Oh, Naruto. You were such a fool when you were younger, but now you've grown into a great shinobi"". I swear to God, they could put that quote in the film and it wouldn't feel the least bit out-of-place. Just *appalling* to behold.The plot isn't any better, either. In fact, it might actually be worse. Not only is it the most PAINFULLY predictable route you could take with this story, it's a casserole of cliches. I mean, not one original idea. And they weren't even good cliches, for Christ's sake!! The most draaaab, booooooring, MMEEEEEHHH conflicts you've seen a billion times before. To be more specific, Naruto and Hinata's whole romance arc in this movie is them beating around the bush with their feelings, until they finally kiss at the end. The main villain is a guy who wants to take over the world, and is defeated. Like, OMG, there was this one part near the climax where Kakashi says something like ""this is the most important thing we'll ever do"". LMAOOOOOOO!!!! Never before have I been less riveted by the thought of an entire planet dying.Now onto the characters. What do you expect, at this point? Terrible. Like instant ramen without the flavor packet. Actual ""character moments"" are non-existent, and every character (save Hinata, who's still boring as ever) acts exactly the same. Even the a-hole characters like Kankuro act weirdly campy. The villain was the only other exception, and he's just some generic freaking weirdo with the same recycled motivation we've seen in the final arcs of Shippuden. You'd at least expect NARUTO to be his usual goofball self! But noooOOOooo, this is a womance, and evewything needs to be taken SEWIOUSLY!*sigh* man, I wish I could go on, but I have a life to tend to"
" One of the best Anime movies ever!!!
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,10,"This movie had action , romance and character development perfectly balanced.
Kishimoto went all out on this movie"
" Great freakin movie
",2019-08-10 00:00:00,10,Made me cry. I love this movie 👍😤 If you love naruto you willll love this movie guaranteed. Naruto love stories are the best.
" what a beautiful end with proper efforts
",2019-05-15 00:00:00,10,"The movie adapted from the Japanese manga genre adventure and friendship by Masashi Kishimoto. I think the movie was successfully worked very well. This movie becomes a closing and a spoiler from the original Naruto story series because in this movie set in time when the fourth ninja world war was over where in the original story has not reached this climax.
The quality of this movie is far better than the previous Naruto the movie because here the main character Naruto is displayed with an adult physical and mental nature which is more stable, as a result the story grooves become more serious so that there is a difference from humorous little Naruto with excessive jokes and the character of this movie. This movie also shows Naruto who is no longer a loser because he is an adult and has become the hero of his village.
In addition, there is a romantic genre insertion which in my opinion is very fresh because in the pevious movie there has never been an insertion of a romantic love story, so the story becomes more alive and more rational.
Even so, this movie does not leave Naruto's distinctive impression of his ninja life that seen from his action of saving the world from his enemies with epic battles and also the role of his friends who always help him and give him encouragement to save Hinata, someone who really loved Naruto. From this movie, you can see and feel a very thick friendship and also a unique romantic love story with beautiful ending if we see from the Naruto struggle so far, this is something he deserves. so, if you a big fan of naruto and boruto, this is the best film that connect the story between them."
" Very emotional movie coming from Naruto
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,9,"This movie might be the best movie coming from an anime series that I have watched so far. It is very emotional throughout the story. I feel like there were some plot holes in this movie, but it's a movie so it might not completely canon to the anime. Other than that I loved everything about this movie. I recommend it."
" The Movie Doesn't Work because the Love Story Falls Flat
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,5,"As the film that is supposed to be the culmination to Naruto's journey, it left a lot to be desired. The main thing that brings this one down is that the love story between Naruto and Hinata, the core of the movie, is fundamentally flawed in the way that it was executed.The romance plot could have been a lot better if there had been some signs of a relationship naturally building between Naruto and Hinata in the TV show. Instead, it all just happened in this movie, and in very questionable ways. They expect us to believe that Naruto didn't understand the difference between romantic love and love for ramen noodles despite him being quite smitten with Sakura for most of the series? Naruto develops romantic feelings for Hinata only after just finding out about her crush on him? Sakura is actually giving relationship advice to Naruto? PUH-LEEZE!I actually thought that the sub-plot involving Konaha trying to save the world from colliding with the moon was pretty interesting. Unfortunately, the film didn't really give it that much attention and instead made the love story the focus.The handling of the characters wasn't really the best, either. Hinata was too much of a damsel-in-distress, her sister ended up feeling like a plot device, and Naruto's other allies didn't contribute much of anything. On top of that, the main villain was pretty flat and uninteresting.To the film's credit, though, the animation is actually pretty stellar. Even by the standards of these movies, this is a great-looking film. There is a really eye-grabbing tint and polish to nearly every scene. The action scenes are intense and well-choreographed.It's just disheartening how the whole project was handled. The romantic scenes between Naruto and Hinata actually could have been quite strong if the build-up had been better. If they had done that as well as make Hinata less of a damsel-in-distress, give more focus to the ""saving the world"" plot, and had a more engaging villain, this film could have been something really special. As it stands, it is a big disappointment and one of the weaker ""Naruto"" movies.RATING: C"
" the last isn't the best
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,7,Review: I enjoyed this movie because it finally brings Naruto and his love Hinata together. The direction and screenplay are both pretty good. The casting and acting are both pretty good also. All in all I would give this three out of a possible five stars.
" .................

" Long awaited!
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,10,It's just awesome. Some people might say that its based to much on love but you actually get to see naruto's 'mushy' side and some great developmemt in his character. He just had to man up at some point. The movie really is worth a watch. And has great action too.
" The movie was allright
",2017-12-31 00:00:00,7,"Not bad , not really good . Positives first -
Amazing voices behind these characters as always.
Beautfiul animation
great action scenes 
Character driven stoey which wass great as the characters of Naruto are top notch.
Disadvantages
Not a great story overall
Really bad background music
Te story is focused on hinata and Naruto , while i think they are cute together , i dont think hinata is a n interesting enough character
Overall i would recommend Naruto fans to watch it just to visit these characters but dont expect much."
" Finally!
",2017-12-11 00:00:00,7,"Naruto as a whole has a very special place in my heart. Having followed it and the incredible journey that both Naruto and the rest of the cast has made during the last 15 years has for the most part one filled to the brim with joy, anger and tears. Sure, the quite large amount of fillers that has plagued the series has quenched my thirst for more Naruto from time to time, but when the filler arcs reached their end and the canon episodes began once again, never did I not feel the urge rush right back. I have watched him and the rest of the ensemble grow up right along myself and my non-anime, actual real friends. That sort of commitment will undoubtedly create some sort of bond. Conflicts has sprung to life and ended, sometimes they ended up happily and sometimes the didn't. At the center of all conflicts, the main event, the main plot has although pretty much remained the same for the duration of the series, I am of course referring to the rivalry between Naruto and Sasuke. When Shippuden reached its end, that feud finally came to a close and in a quite beautifully way if you ask me. And although most other plots was resolved by that time, one still remained. The unspoken love that Hinata felt for Naruto. That is was this movie is about, to at last see this subject come to fruising. As the Title suggests, this movie marks the last chapter of Naruto's journey as the main character, it is also the first of the Naruto movies considered to be Canon which is about time if you ask me. Come to think of it, The title is in my mind a pretty stupid title. I would much more prefer it if the changed it to ""At last"" instead, since it carries a lot of ""at last"" moments.In many ways, this is more of a romantic movie than a action oriented one. Sure there are fighting sequences spread out across the two hour duration, there is a villain, but sadly he was profoundly underdeveloped and his motivations were nearly as bad The Thousand Years of pain technique is strangely effective. But all that stuff is just a backdrop for the main focus, which is without a doubt the love between Naruto and Hinata. However, the way it plays out differs for the two characters. For Hinata, it's all about finally mustering the courage to tell Naruto how she truly feels while Naruto comes to the realization about Hinata's feelings and therefore needs to evaluate how he in turn feels towards her. These sections of the movie is when it shines the brightest while the actual conflict remains quite generic, stuffed with anime tropes. Since it shifts focus in regards to the other movies, At Last has a different tone. It has a more dream-like feel to it, almost surrealistic, striving more to visualize how Naruto and Hinata perceive the world as they contemplate their emotions towards one another. As you might imagine, this gives the movie a slower and gentler pace compared to both most of the series and the rest of the movies. It is for the most part refreshing to behold, but sometimes these moments outstay their welcome and as such, invite restlessness and boredom. It would have been easy to make Naruto react in his often childish ways, but I am glad to say that they have allowed him to process these emotions and revelations in a mature way while still retaining what makes Naruto Naruto. The growth that he goes through is done in a very convincing and satisfying way and is definitely the highlight of the film. Another aspect that I liked but that also exposed one of the movie's biggest faults was the fact that the movie almost gives Hinata as much screen time as Naruto. I would like to change the title a tad more and instead call it Naruto and Hinata: At last, which is good as a romance is very seldom a one way street. This does however lead me to my biggest BUT. Giving Hinata more screen time is a great move, but it is not utilized in a good way. Hinata's greatest moment in the series is easily when she leaps to Naruto's rescue mere seconds before he would meet his demise at the hands of one of Naruto's greatest villains, Pain. At that moment she stops being her usual scared self. She stands proud and is certain of what she must do. Her words and actions does not carry even an ounce of insecurity. In short, she's badass. This movie presents a great opportunity to show of more of that badassness. To show us how Naruto comes to see her, as this incredibly strong and selfless person who is willing to sacrifice all for the one's she cares about. regrettably, none of that comes to pass. She remains a damsel in distress from beginning to end, incapable to do anything but wait for Naruto to come to her rescue. If not for this rather important factor, this movie could have been so much more. If Hinata instead got to show her true strength, if it let her save Naruto instead, Naruto and Hinata: At last would have been great instead of just good.I watched both this and Boruto: The Naruto Movie last night, beginning with this one, and as the credits rolled began to roll I came to the conclusion that this was the best Naruto movie I had seen thus far. The Animations were top-notch, the music both grand and befitting. This movie marks the end of and era and the birth of a new, hopefully the next generation of stories that unfold in the Hidden Leaf village understand that Damsel in distress is a thing of the past."
" A must watch if you're a fan of Naruto Shippuden
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,10,"This is the ending act of the Naruto Shippuden, it was released in 2014 because the manga's ended in 2014, whiles the anime series ended in 2017. Although it doesn't spoil the actual story of the anime/manga series, it starts off right after climax at the end of the Fourth Ninja War, so be wary if you're still in the middle of the series, I highly recommend watching this after the said events.The film is mainly about the romance between Naruto and Hinata, with plenty of actions faithful to the original story, the good thing is, it feels like a canon rather than a filler which is rare for side stories like this. If you have been following the Naruto's story, you should know that Hinata's love was never answered and it almost seem one sided, how the series ended with Naruto getting married almost made no sense. This movie filled the gap and had all the questions answered.To sum it up, it's a great story, with plenty of actions and a lot of fan services. However, it may not be a film to watch for people who have never read or watched Naruto because it is what it is, an expanded ending act and the fans should not be disappointed."
" Jitsu Drain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,2,"WARGING POSSIBLE SPOILERS: OS= Every Self Respecting Naruto Fan Should Avoid This Conclusion Of A Anime Franchise Pros = 1. Great animation for the most part. It's roughly the same as either Anime Series.2. The Humor is there for the most part, I have to admit I didn't laugh or even chuckled for most of the attempted humour of the movie. But what I did laughed at was decent.3. The titled character Naruto I have to admit learned one cool move I actually generally loved over the years.4. The 'Big Bad' did however put up a pretty decent fight. In both of the Climax fights.Cons = 1. The Story as a whole is A BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND UNCOMPLEING!!!!!!!!! 2. I didn't feel that there was any evolution to any of the characters at all through out the years aside from maybe ONLY ONE new move. But character wise there was NO character development AT ALL.3. At its core I feel that this is NOT only a 'Love Story' but also your everyday run of the mill Generic Triangular Love Story (Love Triangle Story), where one person already has a crush one some one and all the while another character usually and especially in this case the villain have a mega crush on one of the other characters. But more on that latter.4. A lot of really Dull Moments, and very if any forgettable good and fun moments in the film.5. I felt that the main 'Love Interest' Hinata is more evolved in the dream vision of the title character Naurto. Than the actual non-dream vision character. And while we're on the subject I also felt that the 'Dream Vision' Sequence just simply drags on and on and on and on for too long of a time.6. And as for the 'Arc' well let's just say. What Arc? Enough said.7. The Movie focused too much on a dumb red scarf that adds little to the 'story'.8. The overall pacing is too slow.9. The 'Main Villain' is terrible. = (1= He's the Cliché take ""NO"" for an answer type = (2= Uninteresting and BORRRRRRRING!!!!!!! = (3= He almost drags the entire movie down. = (4= Even his 'Goals' are very Cliché 'I want to blow up the world and Marry the girl that I have a super crush on' The latter being more important than the former.10. Every element in the movie feels very cliché right down to the 'I'm leaving you to join the bad guys to save your life' type of element.11. The movie literally evokes NO emotion what so ever of any kind aside from one or two literally little juggles. But other than that, literally NO emotions what so ever of any kind LITERALLY.12. The solution to the main 'Global Crisis' is way too simple to solve, and not only that all through out the movie you don't feel that sense of urgency what so ever, I feel as though the characters feel like they had all the time in the world.13. All the fight scenes are so dull. Not even the climax fights are that good.14. And speaking of which by the climax of the movie you stopped caring if you ever cared in the first place and started to check out if you haven't all ready.15. The 'Ending' for this franchise is one of those 'And They Lived Happily Ever After' types, which could have bean executed a little better.16. The 'Global Threat' borrows heavily from Armageddon along with the 'attempt' at trying to defend against it. But with the threat level no where near as high as in Armageddon.HIT and/or MISS= 1. I kind of liked the Happy Go Lucky closer scene after the End Credits. Although it was a little predictable to say the least.CS= All through out the movie I was constantly think to myself that watching a light bulb flicker is more entertaining. And at the same time I was literally brought to tears in how dull and in-entertaining the movie is. And at the same time I wanted to continually bash myself in the head with a steel pipe for wasting my money and time on this. In the end I wondered what was worse and more painful to watch this or Snow White And The Hunts Man? And remember YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!! After all I have said."
" The Last: Naruto the Movie is nowhere near a Masterpiece
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,6,"The Last: Naruto the Movie is nowhere near a Masterpiece. It failed at being a romantic, action, or suspense movie. It had great animation which is to be expected from a such a wealthy franchise but other than that I do not see an intense value in it as some people claim it has. In a Romantic movie you usually see characters build an unbreakable, profound, intense, and spectacular bond that warms and at the same time sets your heart on fire through some kind of meaningful method. Yet in this movie Naruto fell in love with Hinata in around a minute and a half through an illusion. Love is all about emotion in my opinion and there was no emotion in that scene much less the sense of love at least for me as the viewer. In short the movie lacked the emotion to make me care about their love throughout the movie. I had to force myself to finish this movie because it was predictable and could not care about the characters. A movie like this should make you care about the character and be at the edge of your seat but this movie failed at that. Furthermore, I loved the action but there was not enough of it therefore I cannot give it full marks as an action movie which in all honesty was not the purpose of this movie. The purpose was shallow in my opinion because it was to explain how Naruto ended up with Hinata. I would like to note that this weakens the movie because it depends on the series in my opinion. However Kishimoto did say it would so I will not take my opinion into consideration when scoring. Most importantly the plot was not bad but underdeveloped and some elements of the story were unexplained and confusing. However I want to note that I did enjoy it at some points. Thank you for reading and like many this is my opinion so please take it with a grain of salt."
