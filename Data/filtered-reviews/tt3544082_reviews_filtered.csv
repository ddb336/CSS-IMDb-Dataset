" Boaring
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,1,Very slow and boring. There is no story and very overrated movie.I am surprised how people gave it very high rating. Felt like I took 45 years to complete this movie. Such a waste of time. Wanted to give zero rating but there is no option.
" Boring
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,1,"This movie was so dreary, Tom Courtenay could hardly mutter a clear sentence. Charlotte, was, well Charlotte, BORING ! The reviews were mostly outstanding so I persevered, and so wish I hadn't. One poignant moment happens but other further translates from the discovery ! So disappointed."
" Great Acting & Realistic Story
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,6,"A lot of things can be said about acting in this movie.
Both actors are doing their job perfectly portraying a married couple of 45 years.
Critics and most cinephiles will surely love and discuss this personal film very often but the theme and English countryde setting with mostly grey colors do not appeal to me."
" Such a quiet film. Such a showcase for Charlotte Rampling!
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,7,"45 YEARS is a slow film. It's only 98 minutes, but I have to admit I had to check my watch a couple of times. It's a nearly 100% internal film. We're told only as little as we need to be...the rest we have to glean through careful observation. But if you invest that attention into the film, you'll be quietly thrilled to rediscover how great FILM acting (in this case by Charlotte Rampling in particular) can give you insights no other medium can.We meet a reserved, childless British couple in their country home in Norfolk, England. Clearly comfortably settled into a quiet retirement. Husband Tom Courtenay is a mildy grumpy old man (perhaps the beginnings of dementia...he clearly has some mild memory issues and a sometimes unpredictable temperament). Wife Charlotte Rampling fills her days with mundane tasks, but doesn't seem actively unhappy. She is planning a 45th wedding anniversary party for she and her husband (no family to do it for them), and that's the big excitement in their lives. The film deftly paints their relationship...we see how settled they are together and we see how they overlook (for the most part) the little things that bug them about their spouses. There's a sense that they are aware that their lives are winding down...so it's melancholy but not oppressively so around their lovely cottage.Minutes into the film, the day's mail arrives, and with it, a letter that will slowly eat away at this marriage. After 50+ years, the body of Courtenay's first great love has been discovered in the ice of the glacier she fell into all those decades ago while on an extended Swiss alps getaway. Rampling knew that her husband's first girlfriend had died so suddenly and tragically. What she didn't know what how much this past love still resided with her husband even now. He is rattled by the news, and begins to share (unbidden) more and more details about the relationship. And Rampling wants to shake off the feeling (if she hadn't died, I wouldn't even be married to this man). She tries to be supportive, but she is clearly pained. And it only gets worse and she discovers deeper secrets on her own. (No spoilers here, unlike what I've read in other reviews.)Most of this torment is internal. She verbalizes very little, but Rampling does an exquisite job of showing the impact she's feeling. It's touching and believable and worst of all, inexorable. Like a slow moving glacier, we see her comfort, her sense of self and her place in the world, and even her affection for her husband being eroded and tested.Like a glacier, the film appears to move slowly. VERY slowly. The viewer must commit to these characters and to being interested in their very private journeys. If not, the film will be a pointless drag and a downer. If you do settle in, you'll be caught up in these richly drawn out characters (especially Rampling).The Criterion Blu-Ray is gorgeous. The landscape, even as bleak as it is, pops with quiet beauty. The frequent close ups on faces don't hide anything. And the sound mix is, surprisingly, quite effective. I haven't watched all the ""extras"" yet, but what I have seen has been excellent and has really helped bring more meaning to the film.If the description of the pacing hasn't put you off, see this film!"
" Beautiful and Masterful
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,10,"What a beautiful heartwarming film. Delicate, sweet and perfectly written and directed. A masterclass of acting from both of them. Definitely one of my top 10 films of all times."
" The slow working out of feelings
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,7,"Andrew Haigh's subtle film '45 Years' tells the story of a long-married couple whose previously very settled relationship is stressed when the husband is drawn to dwell upon events from his past, before he met his partner. The story's distinctiveness comes from such an event occuring when both parties are contemplating the fact that they are nearing the end of their lives. Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtney are both good in their roles, convincingly conveying the natural vulneratability and change in perspective that has come with the age of their characters. What the film lacks is an obvious dramatic climax; once the frame is established there are no real events to drive the plot, only the slow working out of feelings."
" Powerful performances pack a punch
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,9,"45 Years is a masterclass in character study, communicating volumes with a moment of stillness. The plot is sleight, a slice of uncomfortable history resurfaces to disturb the apparent equilibrium as a couple approach their wedding anniversary. The emotional power of Rampling and Courteney's delicately understated performances is captivating. Each scene is gripping; each look carries a weight of historic subtext, of chances missed, of betrayal. Within a flicker this is all suppressed again into everyday pleasantries as only the British can do. Despite a short run time I've never been so impacted or moved by a film which such a sedate pace. It's through its naturalism in performance and pace, that 45 Years gets its devastating power."
" Smoke and Mirrors
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,2,"Kate and Geoff Mercer are about to celebrate their 45th year of an otherwise mundane childless marriage when they receive news of two dead frozen bodies found in Switzerland. One of the bodies is that of Katya, a former girlfriend of Geoff's before he met Kate (the other is that of a tour guide, but he is promptly forgotten about). This bothers Kate because Geoff doesn't give her much info on that part of his past. Like that Katya was heavily pregnant at the time or that Geoff was behind Katya and said tour guide when they fell (pushed?) over. Geoff acts like it's much ado about nothing, but it eats up inside Kate to the point where at the party she breaks away from Geoff when they dance to their song ""Smoke Gets in your Eyes"", looking annoyed and broken.This is pretty much the plot. I expected a murder mystery. I expected an interrogation with investigators, police, etc. I expected something, ANYTHING to happen. Instead we got a long, drawn-out, dull, mundane, VERY boring character study. Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courteney are great actors and do what they can with the material, but there's no story here to keep you engaged. You just keep looking at your watch to see how soon this will end. A 90 minute film that feels like 45 years of your life wasted."
" The past can still haunt the present...
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,7,"An happily married couple are looking forward to their 45th wedding anniversary party and to many more years together when the husband ""Geoff"" (Sir Tim Courtenay) receives a letter with some rather unsettling news from his past. Initially dismissing this as nothing to wife ""Kate"" (Charlotte Rampling) he soon has to acknowledge that the effects of the contents are having rather a greater impact on him, and consequently both of them, than he had first imagined. The underlying premiss is a tad preposterous, but it does serve to focus the attention onto two delicately played, nuanced performances from the best in the business. It has a pace and intensity that requires concentration and engenders sympathy for both parties with some excellent contributions from Geraldine James helping make sense of something that could be nothing, or bring all tumbling down... It's got some beautiful photography of the Norfolk countryside too."
" twilight of a marriage
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,8,"I like films that give the chance to veteran actors whom I love to play in significant roles, suitable for older age. This is the case of Andrew Haigh's '45 Years', a movie which brings together on screen Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay in two roles that seem to be written and conceived for them. It's a movie that deserves all the attention even if it didn't have these two wonderful actors in the lead roles, the story of a relationship in which the two partners reached the twilight of their lives, a marriage whose foundations are suddenly questioned by an extraordinary event that brings back in their lives an episode that was forgotten, which happened before the two met, but which proves to have influenced their lives and marriage.Rampling and Courtenay are Kate and Geoff Mercer, an elderly and childless couple, living comfortably in the countryside suburbs of an English town, and preparing for a party to celebrate the 45th anniversary of their marriage. A letter from Switzerland brings to the man the news of the discovery of the body of his youth girlfriend, Katya, who had died more than half a century ago in an accident on a glacier at high altitude. The incident not only brings the memory of the missing young girl in between the two old spouses, but also questions their entire relationship and the marriage that seemed stable and lasting. Was Kate and Geoff's marriage based on true and mutual love, or was Kate just a surrogate for Katya, the tragically missing young woman in Geoff's life whom she had never met?Charlotte Rampling's acting is splendid. She is the main character of the drama and is present almost permanently on the screen. She builds her role from silences, from gazes, from dialogues written with sensitivity and discretion, with a typically English discretion and dignity. As the revelations about the drama that happened half a century ago start to accumulate, the material from which the marriage of the two is built seems to be breaking down. Tom Courtenay is also excellent in a role almost as complex, and in a way even more mysterious than his wife's. Has the love story from his youth been forgotten, or has it permanently accompanied him during the 45 years of marriage? Is his attempt to restart the marriage sincere or rather derived from social convenience? It is the spectators who will decide. The film is structured in a balanced and rhythmic way, it happens during six days of the week that flow in succession. Only the weather, as in England, is changing and looks every day differently, which allows the cinematography to resonate with the heroes' moods. Andrew Haigh, a film director that I did not know before, manages to bring to screen in '45 Years' the story of an uncertain marriage in the sunset years of the protagonists. He does it with discretion, sensitivity and psychological depth. This movie might be better understood by viewers - how should I put it? - closer to the ages of heroes and with more life experience. But I think that it deserves to be seen and has a chance to satisfy all movie fans who appreciate love stories, beautiful and ambiguous as they often are in life, as well as quality films."
" I write this review for only 1 reason.
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,2,"I'm sure Mr. Constantine wrote the short story upon which this is based. But, back in the '60s there was a Twilight Zone episode (pretty sure, don't think it was Outer Limits but maybe a Playhouse 90 or something) that foretold this story. In the TV show a man and his wife are at a swanky resort where they train a telescope out a large picture window and study a snowy mountain. The married man and his wife and a man who was a close friend of both, hiked in the mountain years ago. The friend fell in to a crevasse and could not be rescued. Due to some calculating which I did not follow, the people who know of these things had been able to calculate when the frozen body of the friend would move down the mountain enough so that it could be recovered. This has taken maybe 20 years. The day comes and the man and woman hike up to the body. It is recovered and the husband unhooks a locket around the dead man's neck. Inside is a photo of the wife, lovingly inscribed by her to the dead man. It's clear that she and the dead man were in love."
" Facing the end is not easy
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,5,"Kate and Geoff are about to celebrate their 45th wedding anniversary with a big bash, when they receive bad news.Due to climate changing and ice melting, the body of Geoff's previous girlfriend, who died during a hiking trip on the Alps, has been discovered in Switzerland. Geoff is understandably upset by this news and talks a lot about everything that happened, leading to the tragic demise of his former fiancee.Or, does he? Kate thinks Geoff is hiding some truth and tries to put together the pieces. Also, she is weirdly ""jealous"" and doesn't get the situation, even objecting to Geoff's travelling to Switzerland (which, to me, seemed completely reasonable).This sound a lot more exciting than the actually movie, because the mystery is promptly solved and in good British fashion, characters emote very little. By the end, they definitely do not reach any cathartic closure.What we get is lots of slow scenes with Kate musing over the events, without understanding that he whole point is Geoff facing mortality. Mourning for the girlfriend lost 50 years previously is also mourning for his lost youth. His life would have been different if this previous girlfriend hadn't died, maybe better?Therefore, Kate's retrospective jealousy is absurd, or maybe she's just unable to accept that an alternative life with the dead girlfriend would have been more satisfying for Geoff. Kate is concerned only with her ""romance"" and relationship, completely missing the big picture.Unfortunately, the plot focus on her, but I was unable to sympathise. Even for mature people, very slow and dreary movie."
" No one likes a wasted life
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,8,"When this movie started, I almost fell asleep since it was another s-l-o-w British drama. But I'm older and found my attention span returning as more puzzle pieces were revealed regarding why this couple's life was as we see it. We and Kate learn facts at the same time.Those who gave this movie low ratings totally missed the thoughtful nuances that older audiences got. This is a character-driven adult focused drama with bits of information until the last seconds of the movie.Apparently hearing the song is not enough for visual learners, so be sure to turn on your SUBTITLES as Kate and Geoff dance their ""wedding"" dance from 45 years ago. We now ""get it"" as the last puzzle piece snaps into place."
" Rampling brilliant, but all the film has is atmosphere
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,3,"A couple's 45-year marriage is rocked by the (deus ex machina) arrival of a letter to the husband saying that the body of his erstwhile GF Katya has been found in the glacier where she fell to her (deus ex machina) death in 1962. (He was listed as next of kin).The rest of the film depicts Kate (Rampling) the wife's growing realisation that her love for Geoff (Courtenay, überacting) the husband has been misplaced. He even keeps a secret 35mm slide projector loaded with slides of Katya in the loft. Gosh, how metaphorical.The film is structured over a seven day buildup to their anniversary party. We get to see much of the Norfolk Broads, and of the people of Norfolk.To be honest, Rampling's sensitive and convincing (in spite of the ropey story) performance is also misplaced. It ought to be in a film that isn't so inevitably depressing, for a kickoff."
" Slow and somewhat DEPRESSING
",2020-01-15 00:00:00,5,"This movie will get most viewers emotionally engaged at some point. You will find both love & hatred, you will be both saddened yet find happiness but it's too slow and drawn out for my liking."
" Brilliant and poignant
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,9,"At first I thought this movie was a bit slow or contemplative. No such thing, actually. Every moment has its own precise purpose, depicting and, at the same time, uncovering the truth about the 45 year long marriage of Kate and Geoff. The film starts with the couple, or rather just Kate, planning their 45 year wedding anniversary. Geoff seems a bit of an aloof guy, disinterested and irritated about everything and everyone, but Kate has the quiet loving patience of a woman who learned to see the good man underneath the grumpy appearance. Geoff perks up significantly when he receives news of the recovery of the body of his former girlfriend, Katya, who died in a tragic accident in Switzerland before Geoff ever met his wife. The news seems to agitate him to the point of arousing Kate's suspicions. As the film progresses Kate's fearful investigations reveal that Katya was also pregnant with Geoff's child when she died, and she begins to understand how much Geoff loved her. We realize that he told her very little about Katya, hiding from her how important Katya was to him and how completely shattered he was by her death. But most of all, that he selfishly spent 45 years married to a woman he took for granted and didn't allow himself to truly love or even enjoy life because he was emotionally stuck in his past tragic experience that he subconsciously grieved about for the rest of his life. In a poignant moment, Kate tells him what she learned and how hurt and confused she was about being married to a man who, she feared, might have been dishonest and not loved her as much as she thought. Her words seem to have a catalytic effect on Geoff, who maybe realizes he has had 45 years with a wonderful woman that deserved much more. As if truly seeing her for the first time he offers her heartfelt reassuring words and from that moment he behaves cheerfully and attentively towards her, including holding a speech filled with loving gratitude at their anniversary party. Kate seems willing to believe him, until the coup de grace - the dance. While planning the anniversary party Kate chose ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"", as the opening dance song, because it was what Geoff chose as their wedding song 45 years ago. As the couple danced, we hear the lyrics and we see Kate paying attention to them too, as if for the first time. They're the words of someone grieving for their lost love, and in the context of what she learned about Katya, Kate finally faces the cruel and irreparable truth: her husband's choice for their wedding song was about his grieving for another woman, and the 45 years of her marriage were spent with a man who longed for someone else."
" Tremendous and subtle film
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,8,Amazing performances especially Charlotte Rampling - Andrew Haigh is a brilliant director
" When a lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,6,"First off, I'm not sure such a short glimpse at this couple is a fair match for a 45 year old marriage. But all is not fair in love and film. ""45 Years"" wants to come across as understated and nuanced, but honestly those nuances get pretty well nudged along.Fortunately at the anniversary party there was not an ice sculpture.That closing song resonates quite loudly, even without the worst Best Man introducing it as the very same song at the couple's wedding.We see little of the couple's past, a photo montage gives pause, but even that comes from an outsider and is a surprise to the two (fantastic) actors. I assume one of the few details taken from the short story (12 pages, really?) that others allude to in the reviews is that the husband was indeed too ill for attending a 40th celebration.He survived that, but was their love really still-born from the start? Now granted matrimony even without secrets in amber or in peat or on ice may take on a different shade over their long haul.Did the Moody Blues just creep in at the end of their lives together? Hard to tell for me, the film (and maybe many marriages) may feel less rewarding upon scrutiny."
" Can you truly know somebody?
",2019-09-18 00:00:00,8,"I was excited to see this film because it looked appealing to me, and because of Charlotte Rampling as well. It appears to be somewhat slowly paced but in reality, it is all perfectly placed; every event unfolds in a very satisfying manner; each scene is composed beautifully and it lasts what is supposed to last, in order for us to perceive each of the characters' reactions and responses. There is so much drama embedded in their expressions, and less in their words, even the silences are sometimes upsetting. Both Charlotte Rampling (Kate) and Tom Courtenay (Geoff) have phenomenal performances, as the whole film runs through them and their relationship.The film depicts a rupture in their 45 years' union due to the discovery of Geoff's former girlfriend's body. He begins to act strangely as he is obviously affected by the news, and that escalates real quickly into the core of their marriage. Even though we may be alongside someone for such an incredible amount of time, we still have no clue of how certain events can distress a person. Despite having shared half of their lives together, this adversity changes the relationship almost entirely, leading to doubts, concerns, lies, anger, resentment and distance. Above it all, they try to overcome this situation in order to move on with their lives and celebrate their wedding aniversary party.But will things really stay the same?"
" not for everybody but for me its beautiful
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,7,A beautiful acting piece that can feel like a 45 year old film to the normal movie goer. I wouldn't recommend this film to just anybody but if your an avid movie watcher that can appreciate how films work and good acting then this film may be right up your alley.
" Great direction, writing and acting
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,8,"With his 3rd feature film, English writer and director Andrew Haigh shows proof of great filmmaking talent and writing skills. His portrayal of Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay's long-married couple (excellent acting from both) is magnificent."
" A delicate gem of a film
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,10,This is a beautiful written and acted delicate gem.
" Sound Track (spoilers)
",2018-11-12 00:00:00,8,"I think many people have memories of past loves. But we move on. What makes this situation particularly devastating lies in the fact that the husband tells the wife that the ex was older than him. The wife is often listening to music from the 60s. Husband is listening to music from the 50s. At the end of film the wife realizes that at their anniversary party they are probably dancing to what was ""their song"" ( husband and the ex). His happy times were recreating the times he had with his ex."
" Excellent film
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,8,True to life. Not every thought can or should be said. The is not perfect and neither are people.
" Drab, Dull and Flat!
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,3,"A married couple of 45 years are about to celebrate their anniversary with a party. However, a shocking secret could threaten everything that they've built together.The trailer for this movie had me feeling astronomical! I could not wait for this movie to come out. Who doesn't want to see the plot, drama, conflict and explosion of a secret withheld after 45 years of marriage? All to be told through a mature narrative and not some silly teeny bopper, cliche' summer fling garble!When I started the movie I kept waiting for it to pick up in it's pacing. Of course, I'm not expecting an action movie but the movie is very, very slow (from beginning, to middle to end). It's painfully slow and it seems that nothing will happen. There's no suspense as the trailer promised.The characters, pacing, dialogue and imagery are all blank, depressing and sullen. Everything is grey. Whether or not this is a metaphor of their lives after 45 years of being married, it's not entertaining on screen and it's uninteresting.I gave this movie 3/10 because I thought it's a tragedy to give anything lower considering the great actors on board."
" Past love
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,6,"45 Years is a strongly acted film but it is too small scale that looks like television drama rather than a feature film.Kate Mercer (Charlotte Rampling) finds her herself re-assessing her relationship with her husband of 45 years, Geoff (Tom Courtenay.)Geoff's German girlfriend died in the early 1960s hiking in Switzerland. She fell into a crevasse, but now Geoff has received a letter informing him that her body has been found with the glacier melting.As the couple make preparations for their 45th wedding anniversary in Norfolk. Kate is disconcerted as to how deep and strong Geoff's relationship was with Katya. Even though she met Geoff some years after Katya died, she finds out that she shared a similar name with her and even had similar looks. Kate feels fragile and Geoff does not seem to comprehend his wife's discomfort.45 Years is a small film and thought provoking. The viewer could feel perplexed with the uncertainties that Kate feels over a relationship her husband had with some woman long before he met her. You also think that Geoff is a clot for not sensing how Kate feels although the memories of the past clearly makes him anxious as well."
" How well do we know anyone?
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,10,"I always expect a stellar performance from Charlotte Rampling, and ""45 Years"" doesn't disappoint. Like Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", it reminds us that we can't fully know anyone. In this case, her character's husband (Tom Courtenay) learns that the body of a woman with whom he was once in a relationship has been found in a melting glacier in the Alps, and it starts to dominate his life, threatening the couple's relationship.This is a slow-moving film, but deliberately so; it allows the characters to develop. There turns out to be a lot to know about this couple, and their acquaintances. The dreary, rural setting is the perfect locale for the subdued plot. It's not the greatest movie ever made, but still an impressive one. I would like to see more like this, and I hope that both stars keep getting these sorts of roles.Another thing to derive from the movie is that a movie can have a cool soundtrack without having a spiffy, idealized story."
" A very good screen saver for your computer
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,3,"Much has been said about the artistry and good acting involved in this film, and it's true.It's the story that's missing. There's about 30 minutes of storytelling in this 95 minute film. I kept watching because I assumed that there would be something at the end that might explain the earlier portions. Sadly, that didn't happen.There is a great deal of imagery that would be quite pleasant to look at on your computer while it's not being used. However, watching it as a feature-length movie is not recommended."
" Rampling shines
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,8,"Kate (Charlotte Rampling) and Jeff (Tom Courtenay) are a retired, childless couple who live in the countryside region in Norfolk, England. When Jeff receives information about a former lover long gone, the internal lives of each are affected as is their marriage.As the story is of the day-to-day lives of this couple and the various other people in their lives (plus a beautiful dog), the pace seems slow but it is always steady and intriguing thanks partly to director/writer Alexander Haigh. The many quiet scenes lead magnificently to a grand event that is familiar to many of us: a crowded anniversary party. Haigh's screenplay also includes gems about the process of aging including the reflection on how life choices change when one ages.Courtenay is very convincing as someone who withdraws due to the recall of old grief. He also has a great moment in the final scene.But it is fair to say that the movie truly belongs to Rampling. In addition to the film's narrative, she tells a parallel story of her inner life with deep facial expressions and subtle body movements. In scenes when she's with someone else, one is more inclined to watch her as she listens rather than the speaker.Whenever I note an outstanding performance (as I do below), there is usually at least one ""meltdown"" scene in which the performer chews the scenery. That never happens in ""45 Years"". But Rampling's subtlety is so powerful and unique that her performance is exceptional. Though she was born well after the end of the silent move era, she could easily have been a silent film superstar with her unique talents.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Lead Performance by Charlotte Rampling"
" Just Awlful
",2018-06-14 00:00:00,1,"This is a truly awful film. Very slow moving, loaded with pointless scenes, and no resolution of the issue. The plot involves a upper middle class 70-something English couple (Charlotte and Tom) married for 45 years. Prior to their marriage, the husband's old girlfriend died on a hike with him in the Swiss Alps where she fell into a crack in a glacier. Her body was not recovered. The movie opens with the husband getting a letter from Switzerland informing him that her body was finally found in the debris of a melting glacier. We know this in the first minutes of the film then for the next 40 minutes, nothing develops. Just lots of pointless scenes - Charlotte on a river boat, Charlotte with her friends, Charlotte shopping. Charlotte planning a party, Charlotte walking her dog in the country, Charlotte driving, etc. None of these overly long scenes adds anything to the film. At the halfway point, after a grim sex scene between the two - no one needs to see to 70 year olds attempting to boink. Plus the guy fails to perform. Ish. Finally Charlotte snoops in the loft of the house and finds a Tom's old scrapbook and slide projector with images of the dead girl friend who happens to be pregnant. Now you think this may be something - a murder, a child out there somewhere, whatever, but something interesting for the story. But once again, nothing develops out of this. More useless scenes. Charlotte playing the piano, Tom going to his old job for some unknown reason, etc. The movie ends with their 45th anniversary party where there is a long scene of the two dancing and Tom giving a long wandering speech. It's not a nuanced or a complex story., Poorly constructed and acted. It could have been boiled down to 20 minutes."
" Charlotte Rampling is amazing.
",2018-06-01 00:00:00,10,"The movie is excellent. Beautifully directed, great screenplay, but the acting... Oh, God! The acting! Charlotte Rampling deserved six Oscars for her performance! I just couldn't stop watching. She is really, really good. You may or may not like the movie, but you can't not like Charlotte Rampling. Just watch it for her. You won't regret it."

" What just happened? Nothing.
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,1,"Nothing happened. I actually had to read the spoiler reviews to be sure I didn't miss something, but nope, nothing happens in this movie. 
The first scene is a long drawn-out view of the house that showed a good few minutes of nothing happening, I should have realised at that point that the tone was set, and not settled in waiting for a plot to evolve. The lead character was rich and likeable and could have moved me I'm sure, if she'd only had a storyline. So annoyed at myself for sticking this out and wasting my evening."
" ""Is that paint dry yet, dearest...?""
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,1,"You have to wonder why anyone thought it was a good idea to transfer this dead-in-the-water book to the big screen. You also have to wonder why two of our most respected actors would have even considered this turkey.We are treated to a glimpse into the banal domestic lives of an old childless couple where nothing ever happens. That is until we hear about something that happened donkey's years ago.Suddenly the wife is consumed by some kind of jealousy and proceeds to wander about aimlessly looking as if she's just been given a diagnosis of imminent death. Her husband staggers about also -- and here Tom Courtney over plays his part of a doddery old geezer, looking more like a recovering stroke victim.And so it goes -- for ninety odd minutes. Nothing happens. Apart that is from the most disturbing sex scenes you will ever see in a film. If you want to see two 70-odd year old people attempting to have sexual intercourse then this film is for you. For the rest of us we reach swiftly for the sick bag.I suppose the director was going for the laid back arty look of continental cinema. The difference is that in those films something usually happens -- and the characters are at least likeable.These two old codgers are totally boring. You do feel like slapping the pair of them.I have great respect for both actors but would love to ask them what they were thinking when they agreed to this sleep inducing snore fest.Avoid at all costs.How anyone who is not being paid to say so considers this a film-of-the-year is beyond me. Those glowing reviews are suspect.....

" I was expecting more ...
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,4,"... especially concerning Geoff's back story. I was sure the film was going to reveal that Geoff murdered Katya out of jealousy because she flirted with the Italian mountain guide. Instead, we have the rather unrealistic prospect of a very capable and grounded woman, Kate, feeling threatened by a love affair that happened before she met and married Geoff.I can believe that the childless Kate would be deeply hurt by the knowledge that, throughout their 45 year marriage, Geoff had concealed Katya's pregnancy. What I found harder to accept is that such an admirable woman would allow this to dissolve her spirit to such an extent that it reduces her to an insecure ingenue. I was deeply disappointed and rather offended by this treatment of Kate's character.It would have been more far more realistic for a mature, intelligent woman like Kate to confront Geoff immediately, demand an apology and have it out with him rather than for her to almost beg him to come clean about his feelings and his past.When Geoff eventually admitted to Kate that, yes, he would have married Katya had she not died, I found it unrealistic that Kate would grind away on this instead of retorting that she should have married someone who would have respected her enough to be honest about his past. At the start of the film, Kate and Geoff are equals. At the end of the film, Kate sees herself as second best. I think it is most regrettable that the story chose to go in that direction.Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay are excellent, but the story itself is hugely disappointing."
" Engrossing yet confusing
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,8,"The story of 45 Years is so profoundly told by the interior lives of the characters. Rampling's facial expressions tell so much, yet at the end I could not determine if she would stay in the marriage or leave, as she simply could no longer live with the ghost of her husband's past love. Anyone else feel this way?"
" Slow story
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,2,"If you like slow movies, go for it. I found it so boring that I had to read a couple of articles in my newspaper while watching it. And I still didn't miss anything. Even what's supposed to be peak suspension doesn't create much suspension (at least not for me, but other viewers apparently had a different impression)."
" Much ado about nothing
",2018-02-07 00:00:00,1,"Nice to see these old timers. Rampling- Georgie Girl,The Verdict; Courtenay- Zhivago.. For about 5 minutes.
All worked up about ancient history. Skipped to the end to maybe see the corpse.
No such luck."
" A Morose Tail...
",2018-02-05 00:00:00,7,"""45 Years"", while beautifully acted, is a morose tale about a woman, who, after 45 years of being married to the same man, slowly realizes that her husband's life didn't just start when he met her - that he'd had a life that was completely different from their tan, bland existence, and, if not for a tragic accident, would have continued with. The movie trains an eye on what happens when the wife's self-important bubble is burst, and how, thereby, she learns more about her husband in a week than she did over 45 years of marriage."
" Much Ado About Nothing - Just Suck It Up and Get Over It
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,6,"I commend the actors in this film who were strong enough to push through this lame premise.After 45 years of marriage, the idea that a dead ex-girlfriend would cause such a rift in a marriage is hard to believe. Hats off to the two main leads who were able to pull this off.I just wasn't able to sympathize with the characters over this situation. It was really much ado about nothing."
" One of the worst movies I've ever seen
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,1,"If I could give it a 0 I would. An hour and a half of absolutely nothing. Nothing ever happens. Maybe the acting is good, but so what. The people that rate this highly must be on drugs. If this was cut down to a 30 minute TV show, including 5 minutes of ads, it might be bearable, but it would sill be dull."
" You never get to know anyone
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,8,"45 Years is a almost a theatrical film, with not many characters and a slow-burning, subtle but powerful exploration of couple dynamics, the nature of love and trust, the weight of the past on the present, and who truly are those people with whom we share our lives. There is also a pointy finger to the social façade that many couples show to the world, which is not always as rosy or perfect when they are behind closed doors.We get to know this apparently exemplary couple, Geoff and Kate Mercer, who have been married for 45 years and are approaching the celebration of their 45th wedding anniversary, content with their lives, caring, and loving. Until some news related to Geoff's past arrive and open a Pandora's box filled of smells of another woman, a love story that was more powerful that initially seems, and the ramifications that the story had on Geoff's marrying Kate. After the box in open, we get to see the real nature and strength of their relationship.One of the main virtues of the film is, paradoxically, one of its most bugging disappointments: the ambiguity of feelings the viewer experiences about the unfolding events. We get to know the past story, and some of the ramifications on the Swiss love story on Geoff & Kate's love story. However, we don't know why a story that happened so long ago, before the couple met, is hitting Kate so harshly. We get to live, in a way, the same doubts and mixed feelings she feels about the sincerity and integrity of her husband's love, feelings, and openness in their relationship: was she a rebound or was he really in love with her when they married? Why did he hide everything? Why is he's still hiding things and laying about everything? Why is he so distressed about a person he met 40+ years ago? Can she really trust him? On the other hand, we don't really know what is behind Geoff's secrecy and moodiness either: Did Geoff hide his past to Kate on purpose? Did he just want to put the past behind and move on afresh with her? Is his current behavior the result of his inability to deal with his emotions? Or is it a reminder of what life was and would have been like with the other woman? Does he really love Kate? Did he love Kate when he married her?These annoying doubts create a subtle emotional tension that bugs you inside, without any dramatic scene needed to be created. After all, things that destroy a relationship the most aren't always the fights or dramas, but the unsettling feelings of distrust, disrespect, lack of communication and lack of openness of those people with whom we share our lives. At the end of the film, I found that it was OK for us not to know anything for sure. The lack of knowledge produces an unsettling feeling in the viewer, and you get to say (or at least I did) you can never get to know anybody fully, no matter s/he is your partner, parent or offspring, there is always more to any person than meets the eye, and you should never ask people for their secrets as you might not be able to deal with their answer. Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay are great in their respective roles, looking their age and playing being elderly with grace and verisimilitude."
" Bracingly honest look at a marriage gone bad
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,8,"How would you feel if you suddenly discovered that your life partner of close to half a century had been secretly harboring a passion for someone else? That's the dilemma facing the elderly couple at the heart of ""45 Years,"" a moody, low-keyed British drama (based on the novel by ""In Another Country"" by David Constantine) that focuses on a marriage that seems destined for anything but a happily-ever-after ending.With the physical fragility and lived-in faces that come with age, two icons of British cinema, Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courteney, portray Kate and Geoff Mercer, a seemingly contented couple on the verge of celebrating their 45th wedding anniversary. A few days before the elaborately planned event, however, Geoff confesses to Kate that he was once seriously involved with a woman who died tragically in a mountain- climbing accident before he and Kate met. Despite the roughly 50 years that have elapsed since the woman's death, Kate finds herself unable to come to terms with the feeling of deceit and betrayal that gnaws at her day and night over the ""infidelity"" of the man she thought she knew and to whom she had fully given over her heart. Yet, Kate, perhaps cognizant of how petty she might appear making too much of something that happened so long ago, chooses to seethe pretty much in silence, venting her hurt and anger in nonverbal and largely passive aggressive ways. But for Kate, this revelation has ""tainted"" everything that has come before in the relationship - a strikingly sad prospect when there is so little time left to rectify the mistake or to recover what the couple once had between them.Ascetic direction by writer Andrew Haigh - austere close-ups of the characters alternating with stark images of the largely sunless rural countryside - perfectly captures the internal drama taking place within this suddenly altered marriage. The bitterness of the tale is encapsulated most effectively in the uncompromising final shot, a brief but lucid moment that shows how the most brutal of messages can often be conveyed through the tiniest of gestures."
" Dour is the only word
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,1,"It felt like 45 years watching it. Rampling is OK without being stretched. Courtenay is awful. Nothing really happens in the film and it is fairly pointless. Two dull people, one little secret. I'm shocked that she did not already know most of his secrets. Can't have been a very good marriage. If this dull mess is anything to go by those 45 years must have felt like 300 years. Confused about its high-rating. Critics a different breed from ordinary folk? This film makes me sad that so many people have wasted 90 minutes of their actual lives watching it."
" It seemed like 45 years duration!
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,6,Oh dear. What can I say except I feel as if I have aged 45 years watching this feature. The low budget UK film focuses on the 45th wedding anniversary of Kate and Geoff Mercer (Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courteney). Shortly prior to the anniversary party Geoff receives the news that his pre-marriage sweetheart has been found frozen and preserved in a Switzerland glacier. Kate is shocked to discover that Geoff is the next of kin as the Swiss authorities were wrongly under the impression that the dead lady and Geoff were married. To cut a long (and dreary) story short Kate feels not worthy. Kate is a retired schoolteacher with the mannerisms of Mrs. McCluskie off eighties UK TV drama Grange Hill. I can imagine Norfolk couple Kate and Geoff discussing the merits of the pedestrianisation of Norwich City Centre over the dinner table!Certainly a film I won't ever watch again. It has the production values of an episode of a low budget TV program and the boredom factor to boot.
" I give it a 45 out of 100! Kidding, more like 70 out of 100!
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,7,"Hey, I have a Haigh movie to write about. That would be Writer- Director Andrew Haigh's drama ""45 Years"". It stars the fabulous Charlotte Rampling as Kate Mercer. Kate is retired and lives in the England countryside with her husband Geoff. She is in the process of planning her 45th Wedding Anniversary party when a letter comes in the mail detailing the death of Geoff's former girlfriend. To say that puts a damper in the festivity planning, is an understatement. There is a silent tension that builds in ""45 Years"" that is very well directed. Haigh directs the movie in a very simplistic tone that is semi-effective but does leave room with some boredom. Nevertheless, Rampling ramps it up with a mild mannered but outstanding performance as Kate. Veteran British actor Tom Courtenay held the thespian court quite swiftly in his performance as Geoff. ""45 Years"" is not a movie that you should see in the next 45 minutes or hours for that matter, but worth a look for you in the next 45 days. *** Average"
" Much Ado About Nothing
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,3,"My feelings about this film have been expressed very well by other reviewers. I will just add a few details.First of all, it's a little bit rare to see a film about an elderly couple, which I think is a plus. The actors are top-notch, which is also a plus.Having said that, this seems to be a film about nothing. We understand that the husband is secretly obsessed with a woman who died some fifty years ago. We also understand that the wife is distressed by his obsession with his deceased ex-lover.Perhaps I have seen too many movies where there is an interesting arc, or some kind of payoff at the end. This film has no such arc or payoff.It's like watching a slice of real life, which is mainly rather dull. What's wrong with a film about real life? Nothing. However, I want to be entertained when I watch a movie. I want to be engaged with the characters and to feel something at the end.This is more like watching a pointless video diary of two unhappy people."
" A longtime marriage reaches a crossroads
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,9,"This film is one I heard about when it came out but I only just caught it on Netflix two years later. I wasn't disappointed. The acting of Charlotte Rampling as Kate and Tom Courtenay as Geoff gives this grim but beautiful film much of its impact. Married for 45 years and preparing to celebrate an anniversary party that was postponed five years earlier, they find themselves lifted back in time to a long lost love of Geoff. The body of the young woman has been found frozen in the Swiss Alps. Geoff informs Kate (Rampling's character) that they were travelling together when her accidental death occurred, before he and Kate knew each other. Geoff and his onetime girlfriend were also posing as a married couple to maintain a certain respectability. With this sudden news, Kate and Geoff experience a palpable jolt in their relationship. They have been living a comfortable life in the marshy countryside northeast of London. They have no children and are well known in their village. The foggy flatlands are well captured and the stark landscape adds to the haunting and eerie feeling conveyed by the two characters. Tensions build as Geoff takes to exploring his attic for old keepsakes and suddenly talking openly about the love he once shared with another. Kate's anxiety grows as the wedding anniversary approaches. Their nerves are frayed but they appear happy at the well attended party. At the end, it is hard to know the actual impact on the marriage but we know that some serious questions will arise. It is gratifying to see Tom Courtenay, an angry young man of 1960's British cinema and Charlotte Rampling, another great actor, who performed with Allan Bates, Lynn Redgrave and Michael Caine. This is a movie that stays with you after viewing it, a compliment to the story and its great cast."
" A little ado about not very much
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,5,"There is artistry in this film, good cinematography and some fine acting. I was well motivated to watch as Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay were iconic figures of my youth in the 60s. And yet when it finished I just wanted to top myself - if that's how you end up as you age, somewhere between just enduring and pretty miserable, let's end it now! There was nothing unrealistic about the scenario and the depiction of the characters, I just didn't want to spend time in their world. They are so selfish and humourless, it's just depressing. Better to have some kids and get a life than end up like these two. Why did I watch til the end? I was convinced that something was going to happen and couldn't believe it when the end credits appeared. There is in fact no story to this film, merely a scenario. It's finely depicted but I have never seen a film built on so little."
