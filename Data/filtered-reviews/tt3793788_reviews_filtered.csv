" Fun, flirty, raunchy, romantic
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,7,"The poster on Hulu of a woman unzipping the back of her dress made me think that this was an edgy, possibly dark movie about an escort. It's not really. It's actually quite funny. It has that indie film feel, two likeable leads, and it definitely leans into the quirkiness of being an escort more than the darkness or edginess of it. I enjoyed it, and the romance was good too (but if you're uptight and close-minded and judgmental, you should probably choose a different romance, because you'll probably find this one to be offensive, lol)."
" TERRIBLE
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,1,PROSTITUTION AND PROFANITY IS NOTHING TO MAKE LIGHT OF... I FOUND THIS FILM IRRITATING AND GENERALLY UNFAVORABLE.
" I liked it
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,6,"A romantic comedy about an Escort and a Journalist. Luckily it's not attempting to be a new 'Pretty Woman', instead its just a pleasant romantic comedy about two people searching for love. It won't win any awards, but it was worth seeing."
" Enjoyed a lot
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,9,"What a great movie. Looking at the title I watched it with no expectations, but was immediately hooked onto it. More realistic version on pretty women for sure."
" Pleasantly predictable and unrealistic; some great shots
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,6,"From the start, this is like an amiable sitcom. Not really believable if you think about it, but you tend not to. Some wonderfully witty and not in the least natural dialogue. The explanation for why she became an escort sums this up: pat, clever and utterly irrelevant to most women's stories. This can be considered a very lightweight take on ""Pretty Woman"" (known of course for its heft), but is even less believable than that. So why watch? Well, it's often amusing, sometimes sexy and even very touching at certain moments. Notably too it has some WONDERFUL shots of LA, very unexpected use of sites I know and have only passingly noticed. So props to the DP. It's not a terrible movie, certainly not a great one, really a genre piece with no more sex than some with far more innocent pretexts."
" Good for a Friday Night In
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,8,"We're all stuck at home right now, but this is a good diversion on Hulu. Seeing people converse in bars up close then have sex with strangers is the real forbidden fruit of 2020.It starts off with some hilarious scenes in the first 15 minutes. Then the plot gets going and it becomes a nice low-budget dramedy. The leads are good with some great cameos. Don't be fooled by the poster. This is not a B sex movie."
" What's the deal with the audio?
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,3,"The opening scene was funny and intriguing, but as the film went on the audio was frankly bizarre. Between the noise gate, the over limiting and awkward ADR, I couldn't help but feel bad for the filmmakers. The performances were pretty good, though."
" Time killer
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,5,"The whole movie revolves around an article piece and when its finally out there in the wild, we are shown nothing of it. How it affected the characters, what was in it and was it even worth it? It was just used as a plot tool to push the movie to its final checkpoint. The lead male is absolutely useless (both actor and the character) with minimal expressiveness in any circumstance. Miss Fonseca is still better but her character could use more development.Movie lacks flow and is haphazardly put together. Camera work is better than the script. Comedy works in a few places though.Conclusion: Underwhelming. Watch only when you have nothing else on queue"
" An unconvincing portrayal of the profession
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,3,"An out of work journalist (Michael Donegar) is also a sex addict. He tries to impress a prospective employer that he is currently writing a piece about the day to day life of a high class escort (Lyndsy Fonseca) he has met. He persuades her to work with him on the piece, but soon also (of course) finds himself falling for her.A light hearted look at the oldest profession is far from convincing and feels more like a more adult Hallmark movie."
" Fun Rom-Com
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,6,"The Escort is a fun movie to watch with friends, a partner, or even by yourself if you're just really bored and you want to watch a new movie. I recommend you to watch this movie not expecting high quality, but rather just to enjoy a silly love story between two people who'd normally be unlikely to associate with one another by choice. For what the movie has to offer and for not being high budget, it really worked out in my opinion and the two main characters are really cute together. Would recommend this movie to anyone who wishes to watch a movie they haven't seen before in the romantic comedy/drama genre."
" Surprisingly good
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,7,Thought it would be something other than it turned out to be. Pretty good little romantic comedy in my opinion!
" Pretty Woman?!? What's that?
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,6,"Lol,, jk,,,A guy is addicted to sex with random women,, then he meets an ivy league educated escort,,, what's going to happen?!?Anyways,,,This is good. Go watch it!"
" Enjoyably implausible
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,7,"And I thought my generation was wild... hmm. I didn't believe a moment of it, but that doesn't mean it wasn't fun. (Maybe I just didn't want to believe it.) It obviously wants to be the Pretty Woman of its time, since it references the movie-can't remember the quote, but the two leads both loved it. (Makes you think.... Oi. I hope impressionable children didn't actually decide to become escorts or go at it like bunnies using sex apps because of Pretty Woman.) There were several ""so bad it's good"" aspects: (1) every woman pleasant-looking Mitch hooks up could be a Playboy centerfold. (2) How did the actress interviewing Natalie for business school keep a straight face? And why did she need an MBA to start a business that was already established? (Trying not to give too much away.) (3) The obscure magazine Mitch is writing the spec piece for is available absolutely everywhere and is read by everyone of all ages. Even if it's a stand-in for Vanity Fair or Rolling Stone, really? Bruce Campbell as the father is the best thing in it, although he seems to be in another, lighter movie. Also nice work by Rumer Willis. In general, the movie takes itself awfully seriously and doesn't quite understand who its audience is (not that I really do, either-people looking for light entertainment on Prime, I guess). At the danger of sounding like the grumpy older woman that I am, this generation has managed to take a lot of the steam out of sex. If you're looking for a turn-on, this won't be your thing. It's fun because it's silly, and the two very cute leads have a nice rapport and some clever dialogue."
" Enjoyed!
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,9,"Good concept and an interesting story that is both educational on the life of an escort and has a love story line. The actors were amazing at their parts. Overall, a must watch."
" Do i have to give it any stars?
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,1,"Poor writing, poor directing, poor acting, poor story, poor characters, poor plot, poor poor poor"
" half good
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,6,Funny for a while but then it petered out when the rom took over from the com.
" Three MALE screenwriters perpetuate the myth that sex workers aren't damaged by their profession
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,3,"What's missing? Drug addiction.Seriously, a friend who went to a good college, came from a good home and a Mensa membership
became a high class escort to pay for school. She left the business with a drug habit, several stab wounds and a legacy of pain. She died from an overdose a decade later.Sex workers are people. Some of them do go on to graduate school and a happy life, but most do not. Screenplays like this one only deepen the callous disregard with which men use sex workers.The actors do a great job, but cannot overcome the smarminess of the premise. If you want to see a romcom where broken people fall in love and heal each other, see ""Silver Linings Playbook."""
" Great director
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,8,"The direction was very good and the story wasn't so bad I honestly don't think it's that bad, I personally wouldn't date a hooker or an ""escort"". The characters didn't really connect with me personally but I think its kind of a cute story, i don't know what specifically makes the movie good or bad but I really enjoyed it, I have terrible taste for example I cried during Click the movie with Adam Sandler and the remote the end always makes me cry and I've seen it like 7 times. I've definitely seen worse and overal again not that bad definitly worth a watch."
" Great Movie üëçüèª
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,9,"I don't like romance, but this movie it different than any other movie I saw.."
" Poorly Researched, Wastes Lyndsy Fonseca's Good Performance
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,2,"The movie was problematic for several reasons. The writers and director did not research the full-service sex work (fssw) vertical, nor journalism before writing and directing this film.*Misconceptions*The concept of every escort refusing to pay taxes is incorrect.
A journalist not researching before conducting in-field work is ridiculous.
A journalist in 2016 with a degree in political science or journalism only looking for newspaper work is a larger High Fantasy myth than Lord of the Rings (I work in journalism), especially someone Mitch's age.
The fact Natalie never brings up screening, and wasn't aware of face blurring technology is comical.
Natalie falling for Mitch after blatantly disrespecting her multiple times is laughable.
Portraying every fssw client as garbage feeds into the stereotype.
Mitch and Natalie beginning to date only after she quits the industry pushes the trope of sex workers being undateable across all verticals in the industry.The movie wasted a good performance from Lyndsy Fonseca with lazy writing and directing by those who decided to not research the two fields discussed in the film.It would take very little effort to reach out to an escort and journalist to interview them about their work. At least they did enough research to have Natalie say, ""Off the record.""True Score: 2.2"
" Eye Opening & Overall Great Storyline
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,10,"This movie was really good, it had some realistic eye opening points,"
" It Could Have Been Better
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,7,"""The Escort"" is a movie about an unlikely partnership between Natalie,a Stanford-educated prostitute, and Mitch,a sexually-addicted journalist wanting to explore the city life.The movie that stars Michael Doneger and Lyndsy Fonseca has all the elements that would make up an entertaining movie such as humor, drama, a realistic portrayal of the view of the city life, and interesting themes such as ambition and romance.Other reviewers have considered it an updated version of Julia Roberts' and Richard Gere's ""Pretty Woman"" during its time of release in 2015. Personally,I do agree with that assessment in terms of realism as ""Pretty Woman"" is more of a love story between two unlikely people - the rich man and the prostitute. But what is lacking in this movie are formidable thespians.Overall,the movie could have been better and more entertaining with more formidable and talented lead cast."
" Genuine as F
",2019-11-25 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely loved this movie. It departs from classic love stories in a very 2019 way, where the developing relationship becomes a team that the viewer roots for and only briefly becomes a realistic anxt. The actors show such genuinity and chemistry that it becomes inescapably compassionate and real. I just loved it."
" Promising
",2019-11-20 00:00:00,6,"I liked this movie better than I thought I would. The truth is, it's a lot more thoughtful than your average navel gazing indie. My major critique would be that the director/actor/writer should give up either acting or directing in his own films. His performance is disconnected and he's obviously talented so it feels as if he's maybe wearing one too many hats."
" Fantastic!
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,9,"I just saw this movie on Amazon Prime and it is great! It is funny, witty, poignant, dramatic, and touching all rolled up into a completely entertaining movie. The actors, especially the leads, do a fantastic job! This is one of the most under-rated films out there."
" A pleasant comedy
",2019-07-17 00:00:00,7,"Desperate for a good story, a sex-addicted journalist decides to enter into the world of high-class escorts.The most interesting of this film is the chemistry between the main characters (mistrust,jokes, empathy,friendship and tenderness).Also interesting is the reasons why Natalie choose this way (bullying, publicactions on the net) and her decision to get out of this business one day.
The performances of Lyndsy Fonseca,Micahel Doneger and Bruce Campbell are very good."
" Wow this was bad
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,1,"As if any woman with access to any man she wants would go with this guy. Totally male-centered movie, characters are barely developed, if at all. The woman just exists for the prop of the male character's ego and it's very grating. This is some kind of male ego-driven masturbatory fantasy. If the ending was more realistic perhaps I could have tolerated this silly narrative a BIT, but no. Typical ""nice guy"" who is not, in fact, ""nice"" AT ALL."
" I watched this movie because Bruce Campbell was in it
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,6,So I only put this movie on because I noticed Bruce Campbell's name on the cast list. It turned out to be a decent rom-com even though it took a long time before Bruce made his appearance. I like how everything played out except I thought it would have been a lot better if Bruce Campbell was the young journalist offering protection to the escort in exchange for an eternity of free love-making and the kid played Bruce's dad. Just the personalities would have worked out a lot better that way.
" Pretty Woman, In Reverse ....
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,9,"There are a few things that this VERY low-budget 2010s imitation of ""Pretty Woman"" has going for it. One, it takes place in the new age of internet journalism and internet hookups. Second, it has great cinematography. I love the art wall and behind-the-head panning shots. Also great, updated music. Third, there is some really great and surprising A+ dialogue, just not all the time. Fourth, and in a very unusual twist, both leading characters are having pickup sex all the time so there is no power dynamic of one over another like you see or imagine in most romcom movies. And unlike ""Pretty Woman"", in this movie the hooker has all the power, not the man, so it's a male fantasy, not a female one (hint: there is NO male Rodeo-Drive shopping trip!)Fifth, the film has a lighthearted sense of humor, as evidenced in the opening scene. And lastly, and remarkably, the movie stars its own 29-yr old screenwriter, as a newspaper writer, and so it is perhaps autobiographical; I wonder?This doesn't happen to me hardly ever but 3/4 of the way through the movie I got so worried about the ending that I began frantically searching for the plot conclusion. I found no spoilers before the ending. I have to give it 9 stars based on how I began rooting for the characters; it was gripping.This is well acted but with a $5m (not $40m) budget for A+ charisma stars and A+ blockbuster soundtrack. Definitely a much more realistic film and more thoughtful, too, than ""Pretty Woman""."
" Predictable but...
",2019-04-09 00:00:00,7,"From the start it was pretty woman with a modern twist, all she needed to say was ""I say who, I say when, I say how much"". Even though you can see where the story is going bat every step it is enjoyable and in a way relatable. It was Romantic Drama 101, finding love, losing love, getting love back."
" Much better than I thought it would be from the reviews.
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,8,"In a world where relationships between people have gotten so crazy that it is considered normal for a guy (or women) to randomly sleep with strangers based off an app, perhaps the idea of prostitution can be looked at more normally. The writers did a good thing here and fleshed out the motivations of the characters. From the summary you know a journalist wants to follow around a high class escort for a story. But why would she agree? They find a reasonable reason. Then you want to know why she would be an escort, well they find a reasonable, dare I say modern. reason for that. They two main characters have tons of chemistry and that made it worth a watch. My only quibble is that the amount of chemistry merited more scenes with them prior to falling for each other. But definitely worth watching."
" Dull Rom Com with a twist
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,5,"I kept an open mind with this film but paid the price. Half way through it I knew I should have quit but alas you want to see how it ends. This was another lame rom com where the guy and the girl are apart, come closer, then have a fight and wind up together. A very weak formula which makes for a mediocre film.I consider you have a hard think before watching this film. Either do the laundry or read a book instead."
" Pretty good rom-com
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,8,"If you are looking for nudity and sex, this isn't it. But it turned out to be a slightly different take on the genre. It has all the standard plot points, unlikely boy meets unlikely girl, they like start to like each other, have a falling out and the inevitable get back together. The acting is good, a few chuckles here and there and running jokes that make it pretty pleasant. My only dislike is that the main guy is played too wooden. I never really see him truly have emotions about anything. It works well in the beginning, but later I wanted to see some change and I didn't really get that. Otherwise, worth a watch and I enjoyed it."
" Nothing romantic or comedic
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,1,Escort refers to someone who escorts someone to events. This is nothing but a movie about a prostitute and a sex crazed man. When searching for reviews on this movie it was compared to porn movies. It is also compared to Pretty Woman. Not even close. Pretty Woman was in no denial that she was a prostitute.
" NO MORE BOARDWALK EMPIRE
",2018-06-22 00:00:00,8,"This is your odd ""Pretty Woman"" type of romantic comedy that is perhaps more drama than either genre. This is not your dumb sleazy ""50 Shades of Shasha Gray"" escort type film.The story centers on Mitch (Michael Doneger) who is a journalist and writes obituaries. However ""Obituary Writer"" is not a film title people will flock to. Mitch is also a sex addict who uses a sex app on his phone to hook up for fast nameless sex. His behavior gets him in trouble and he gets fired from his job. He applies for another job, but needs to present a printable article, i.e. not obits in order to get hired. He meets up with Natalie (Lyndsy Fonesca) an educated escort. She allows him to follow her around so he can write a story about her....just follow the formula.Bruce Campbell comes in at 48 minutes into the film as the rich father of Mitch. Rachel Resheff plays Mitch's potty mouth sister. The film has humor, but is not laugh out loud funny. It is a light drama that keeps you engaged even as you know how it ends.Guide: F-Bomb, sex, remarkably no nudity."
" Entretained movie, but very predictable.
",2018-06-21 00:00:00,7,"Since the first 20 - 30 minutes you're gonna start guessing what's gonna happen, anyway, it's not that long so you can handle all the predicted story."
" New twist on guy meets girl...
",2018-06-11 00:00:00,7,"Enjoyable, Good movie for a rainy afternoon!Grab beverage, get your favorite Blanket, and give the dog a treat! I recommend it."
" By the numbers rom-com without much of the com
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,4,"So, did the main actor write a script for himself to act in or just so he could make out with some beautiful women, particularly Lyndsy Fonseca who is excellent in this?If it was a vehicle for his acting, Michael Doneger runs the gamut of emotions from A to B. Hardly a demanding part but thank god they didn't let him direct!Yeah, ok, it's not a bad movie. His talent might lie more with writing than acting, although I haven't seen him in a demanding part. It's billed as a comedy/drama/romance or a rom-com in most people's book. It's not exactly funny. It is 'light' and there are a couple of good lines. The subject is supposed to be 'edgy' but , heck, it's not really. It has Pretty Woman written all over it and even references it in the movie (almost the funniest part) so it's far from original. Hey ho...It's nowhere near a top ten of rom-coms, either in the rom or the com category, but it has a fair stab at the genre. Rom-com aficionados look elsewhere. If you're not too fussy, give it a look."
" Light fare - lovely lady working her way through college...laying on her back for tuition
",2018-03-20 00:00:00,5,"I cannot call this a heavy drama, nor an x-rated adult film, nor a comedic/camp picture. What this film is in my view is light fare for a boring evening when there is nothing else to watch. A young man who works as a magazine writer named Mitch (Michael Doneger) spends most of his free time (and sometimes while still on company time) using an app on his phone to hook up with horny chicks for a free and quicky lay with like minded woman.One night, while sitting on a bar stool Mitch accidentally strikes up a conversation with an attractive young lady named Natalie (Lyndsy Fonseca) who turns out that she is only looking to hook up with men who can afford her hourly/nightly rate and Natalie does not work cheap.It doesn't take Mitch and Natalie long to determine they need each other strictly for working purposes so Mitch agrees to be Natalie's unsolicited pimp to fend off any aggressive clients, and for Mitch's pro bono physical presence Natalie agrees to allow Mitch to take notes for a bold article he is preparing for a magazine that he wants to work at.Mitch and Natalie's relationship becomes complicated when they start to have true feelings for each other and now you have a story that has a typical end. No spoiler here. It is worth a watch but this is nothing special, just light fare. I give the film a 5 out of 10 rating."
" Comedy romance between a Stanford educated hooker and a sex addict
",2017-08-29 00:00:00,7,"I'm a fan of Lyndsy Fonseca from Nikita and Kick Ass and her charm keeps this comic romance movie watchable. She plays a Stanford educatd escort who meets a journalist / sex addict who decides to write a story about her. There is reason why she is an escort.Following a tried and tested indie romance formula, the 2 flawed characters fall in love - a little drama ensues and then there is a happy ending.There haven't been too many happy hooker fairy tale stories since Pretty Woman. This is many years later so things are a tad less innocent and a bit more realistic but the tone of the show is light and comical in parts. That doesn't completely cover the ickiness of the premise but neither did Pretty Woman."
" Change name is easy
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,6,"There were rave reviews attracted me to watch, however the outcome bum me out. The movie looks like a salute to Pretty Woman (1990) , but it is more quiet and less sexy, Escort more like a tacky cheesy romantic story, no fun no concepts. The plot is very slow, it barely kept my interest to finish.The biggest loophole of this movie is the name, the Stanford graduated escort said she couldn't find a job with her scandal name? Then why can't she change her name? Just fill out a petition, millions people changing their names for different reasons. Totally no senses plot writing, almost embarrassed my IQ, I doubted myself why would I watch such movie. Beside, many people share a same name. Can't find a job is more like a excuse because her tax free money is easier to make.Lastly, I don't like the shaking camera movement. I always want to jump into the screen, and settled the camera!"
" doesn't really get there
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,4,Mitch Cooper (Michael Doneger) chases anonymous sex online in L.A. He's at a hotel bar waiting for another date when Natalie (Lyndsy Fonseca) shows up. She's actually a high price escort working the bar. The mix up does not go well. Mitch gets fired as a reporter. He struggles to find another job and decides to write about the escort world. He goes back to the bar to find Natalie as his subject.This is a lower budget indie. The guy is lackluster. Fonseca is really the only reason that I started watching this. This tries to be a little humorous with limited success. She has a bit of sass. There are references to Pretty Woman but this is not even in the ballpark. The couple has no chemistry. It's not particularly sexy or fun or dark or poignant or anything. Fonseca gets it part of the way but it doesn't really get there.
" The story of when a high-end, educated escort meets a struggling journalist.
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,6,"Pretty intentional. It says it doesn't want to go that way, but in the end that's what it does. So the story was nothing new, but it was the cast, particularly Lyndsy Fonseca. She was too hot for the title role. A sex addict journalist tries to do a story on high-end escort for his new job. They agree on to be purely professional, but as they explore each day, a new friendship develops. After learning that she's well educated and the reason for taking this path, it all comes to when his story is ready to publish. Their both lives are about to turn around, but how is what told just before the end.The film was not bad, but not good enough to praise. Worth a watch if you are not anticipating and just want an entertainment. Obviously the film is for the adults, but you won't be happy if you are looking for according to the title. Because the title name is only where the film plot was initiated and the remaining story was all about the character surrounding it. So it is not an erotic drama or romance or a thriller. The film was short and well maintained pace, but not the film of the year.6/10"
" terrible story but still a great film
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,8,"the reason this flick gets such a low average rating is probably because the story is very weak. a dead horse beaten to death repeatedly. way too much covered by mainstream movies.meanwhile, almost everything else is flawlessly done here. okay, maybe not the best performance by all actors, but this doesn't really impact how we can enjoy watching it.good timing, chemistry, jokes, bashing pseudoscience, you're never hanging in a single moment even while you can always know what's going to happen in the ""plot"" (if you can call this a plot).in short: a brainless laying back experience and, perhaps above all, both a quite realistic and uplifting optimistic romance. touching indeed."
" Cute but similar story lines
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,6,"Cute film. It's supposed to be a romantic comedy but I didn't find much comedy in it. The movie moved a little slow as well but not horrible. However, it reminded me of the movies with Drew Barrymore called ""Never Been Kissed,"" except this is about sex and escorts rather than something more innocent. Same storyline with main character being a reporter/journalist, semi-going under cover, falling in love with the other guy, blah, blah, blah."
" Good, but not for obvious reasons
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,6,"I chose this film while randomly perusing Amazon Prime's lists, a strange new occupation I find a lot of us pursuing of late. I was looking for something in the vein of a Sebastian Gutierrez indie flick. I chose the movie based entirely on the description and poster, something I never do any more as my time is too precious to gamble on a bad movie. I was rewarded with a pleasant, if unremarkable, film that I'd definitely recommend, but for reasons other than the obvious ones. It wasn't bad and had a decent story but that's not what prompted me to write a review about it.In downtown LA a young woman is earning her keep as a high-priced sexual escort and a young aspiring writer has lost his job and is looking for a good story. He's also addicted to an ""instant hookup"" app and ends up meeting our lady of the night in a bar when he thinks she's his next match. They form a partnership where he gets his story (about her) in return for watching over her while she deals with unsavory men, and if you can't guess what happens next this is probably the first movie you've ever seen.I found the first 20 minutes or so enticing; the cast was attractive, the dialog crisp, the acting sit-com level or higher and since it opened with a woman having ""specialty"" sex and the male lead tramping around, it seemed like a film that was going to have an edge to it. It doesn't, and in fact it ends up being lighter fare, topically, than anything you'd see on prime time TV, but it passed the time. I started checking my phone at the half-hour mark and never really engaged again after that but I didn't turn it off either.What really sold me on this film, and has kept me thinking about it for days, was the soundtrack. Not since the 80s or 90s can I think of a movie where I was so intrigued by the music playing underneath scenes and transitions, and the way it flavored my experience of this film. I've spent a lot of time in downtown LA and thereabouts and with the great photography and soundtrack the filmmakers really got the ""feel"" of the area right. It's not as easy a thing to do as one might imagine; making a film that accurately portrays a location isn't as simple as just planting a camera there, you have to get the feel of it right.I'm also intrigued by films that are focused on sex but don't actually include any sexual content. There are a couple of fully-clothed ""humping"" scenes in this movie but it's all fairly innocent and unobtrusive. It reminds you that a steamy sex scene with full nudity isn't always necessary to make a point. Films made before the ratings game came into play in the late 60s or so had to rely on technique rather than bared skin to convey sexual tension. Again...how it ""feels"" rather than simply how rutting looks when you focus a camera on it. It's not a common practice any more and I have no qualms about showing sexuality and nudity, it's just intriguing when it ISN'T shown, especially in a film that is ostensibly about a woman who sells her sexuality for a living.Lastly, I found it interesting that the movie seems to take place in a world populated mostly by Caucasians. It's not something I really thought about until I saw this movie; the idea that these people dwell downtown but rarely encounter any racial (or gender, for that matter) diversity seems odd. Again, having spent a lot of time in these locations it's unlikely to say the least. It's not a judgment call, I'm wasn't offended, just intrigued...had the film been made 15-20 years ago it wouldn't have even crossed my mind.Anyway, worth a look, which is actually quite an accomplishment."
" Not quite but almost
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,6,"I thought that it was a brave role for the lead Lyndsy Fonseca, who from outward appearances at least, seems to have delicate sensibilities. In my opinion she doesn't really pull it off and doesn't convince me that she could be a prostitute, high class escort or not.I have seen her in the Kick Ass franchise and believe that she would be more suited to the rom-com genre.As to the rest of the cast, I liked the character of her father, who was a regular in Hercules the legendary Journeys and Xena. He is a versatile actor whose talents haven't been exploited to the full in my opinion.I also liked the rest of the characters but was not totally enamoured with the film as a whole. It seemed to tread a well worn path and didn't elicit any emotion from me, bar the final scene, which I had hoped would end differently."
" Don't judge a book by it's cover
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,2,The picture/poster they choose to use for this movie is as provocative as it gets. It's beautiful! The film itself was lukewarm in all regards. I think Lyndsey would be perfectly cast as Kitty Pryde in an X-Men film. Loved her in Kick-Ass. I don't like any of these characters. I don't relate to any of them either. Who is this film for? Seems to me it's an attempt at film making by children with ultra rich parents.
" Sweet movie
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,7,"This is one of the better romantic comedies I've seen. Interesting through out, believable plot and twists, interesting characters and satisfying ending. All in all this was surprisingly good movie. I would definitely recommend this movie for a date night or if you just need to boost your morale in dating life."
" I like this movie, especially that exist. It is a closed realisation to the reality
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,10,"All the story is inspired from the reality and it is closed more to the good parts for this industry. Really, is a place for smart people and especially for smart women, who are more attracted to start, good experience for single. But then like in the movie it becomes interesting and the way you handle your life through this can bring you to something that not everybody live. Our colleague experienced a story same like this in Brussels through the EscortBruxelles.be where her mysterious lover become now her boyfriend and she quit the call girl adventure. She was just doing that to find out her half and she did it. Nice story."
" Edgy Rom-Com / Fairy tale for grown-ups
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,7,"Getting right into it:1. Do I believe the story?Sure. Sex addicted guy struggling with self esteem, work & family issues meets kind, pretty girl with the perfect resume struggling to overcome an infamously tarnished adolescence who finds herself working as a high end escort to achieve her dreams while she's still young & pretty. What's not to believe?2. Do I care about the story?Absolutely. In fact, the story is what made me rate this movie 7/10.3. Do I believe the characters?Mostly. The only major flaw in The Escort was that I didn't believe Michael Doneger's Mitch to be a journalist. I believed all of the other characters, certainly Lyndsy Fonseca as Natalie, and I believed Mitch's situation and his personal life, but he just didn't convince me he was a budding young journalist, or a writer of any sort for that matter.4. Do I care about the characters? Yes. They evoke empathy. I want them to resolve their issues, to figure it out, and live happily ever after.I found The Escort to be a fun, entertaining romantic comedy, a fairy tale for adults. Flawed, but irresistible in the end. It was a bit melodramatic at times, and supporting cast played limited roles, though they played their parts well. Regarding what I consider to be the major flaw, Michael Doneger's unconvincing rendition of a journalist, even though someone may be down on their luck and/or lacking self-esteem, I still need to see a hint of aptitude, at the very least. I realize that Mitch's personal problems are affecting his professional life -- I simply need to believe that somewhere deep inside, they have potential in their chosen profession. I need to see their potential, their passion. I never saw that in Mitch.To her credit, the supporting actress who plays the female head journalist interviewing Mitch for the magazine job executes her role perfectly, particularly in the last suggestion she gives Mitch, to find his passion as a journalist. That flaw almost made me score The Escort 6/10, more in line with its average rating on IMDb, but as you can see, I gave it a higher score. Why? I really liked the story, and in the final analysis, story matters most.7 out of 10"
