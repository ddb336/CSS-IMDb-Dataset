" Sweet and fun and chaotic
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,7,"Not zany Pegg, but thoughtful Pegg. Cheesy but without the Americano.
And an important theme as well.
Well worth a matinee viewing."
" A contrived movie, That pulls it off at the very end!
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,7,That pulls it off at the very end Only because of the innocence of Simon Pegg!
" Africa? For happiness?
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,1,The movie is fantastic until he goes to Africa. Why on Earth would you go to Africa to research happiness?
" Life
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,8,I really like the movie. It makes me think about lots of things. Good movie to watch. Search for happiness and find many answers. Also good actors are in a row.
" Outstanding
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,10,"Possibly the best thing that Simon Pegg has starred in, and, he has been one of my favorite character actors for a long time. This movie has it all, and, it was due in no small part to the writing."
" Delightful, adventurous and emotionally daring!
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,10,"This movie absolutely astonished me! I love adventure, challenging oneself and love. I love loving people for who they are and not being ashamed of it. This movie has it all and so much more. A type of Eat, Pray,Love that even men will enjoy. My husband loved it. Laugh and cry and don't be afraid of it. Go on this ride and enjoy every minute of it!"
" Similar to Walter Mitty, while totally it's own!
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,10,"What a great movie! Very feel good with just the right tastes of all of the other emotions you could imagine.I compared it to The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller version), because Walter Mitty is probably my go to feel good movie. The main difference between these is that Walter Mitty incorporates daydreaming and imagination, where as Hector and the Search for Happiness is solely about getting outside of yourself to find that Happiness.I feel bad bringing up The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, because I'm shocked that it's has over 200,000 reviews when this only has 40,000.Hector and the Search for Happiness is like my own life in the sense that Hector travels worldwide to find happiness.I myself have found my happiest moments by traveling alone worldwide and getting with locals of various different cultures.I am not leaving spoilers, so I refrain from saying more, but this movie gets me every time. I have watched it numerous times already and am actually ordering the Blu Ray now so I always have it at hand. This will be one of my go to movies when I introduce friends and new friends to my idea of great cinema. Bravo!"
" Ok
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,6,"It was pretty boring until the last 10 minutes which was pretty feel-good.But yeah, I would definitely be happy if I'd had a girlfriend like Clara! Why he would even consider going on that trip is beyond me."
" Finding Hector made me happy
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,10,"I've been a big fan of Simon Pegg ever since Shaun of the Dead, so naturally when I came across this , I had to give it a go. I was not disappointed in this utterly charming, humorous, insightful and entertaining film. Wonderfully vibrant locales and characters , set in a beautifully photographed journey of personal discovery. I loved this movie"
" FUN & LIFE ENRICHING
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,9,"What is it about critics that irritates me so? One of my favorite things to do is to take a look at the reviews, after I've seen a movie...especially one I really liked. I watched this movie with a group of four. We all rated the movie at a 9 out of 10. I went to Rotten Tomatoes first...31% from the critics. Much more pleased when I stumbled on to this site & saw 7 out of 10. Great exercise in figuring out who I will return to for movie reviews. All this aside...I found this film immensely satisfying, enjoyable, & I would even say, life-enriching. Can't wait to share it with other friends. I can only assume that many critics don't like films that compel them to examine their own lives...like I did, after watching this movie."
" If you love Simon Pegg don't watch this
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,2,It's a shame that such fine actors and beautiful scenery can't save this film. One soppy tired trope after another. I am unhappier having watched this.
" Patronising & dismissive minimisation of mental illnes
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,1,"Basically, the moral of the story is echoed at the end of the film by the protagonist and his happiness mentor who embodies the stereotypical Chinese confucian wisdom: ""Happiness is an obligation.""Yes, basically it is the usual self-indulgent, twee garbage that dogmatically makes the argument that we are all obligated to be happy, as if happiness is a choice in the first place. As a result, the film risks instilling the very dogmatic notion that happiness and sadness are merely just a state of mind that can be ""rectified"" by the power of your individual will alone (basically self-induced brainwashing). It, thus, is dismissive of mental illness and is your usual crock of nonsense that reinforces these conservative-liberal ideas that we could really do without. Dark age thinking at it's finest."
" Great uplifting movie!
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,8,"This is a lovely movie, very uplifting!
Great acting and scenery too, highly recommend :-)"
" Thats me
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,10,I can see my life.. hector same me. And why i have to write so much ?
" Don't believe the critics on this one
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,8,"I don't understand why the critics were so... well, critical of this movie. I did experience a lot of emotions, and I found the ending satisfying. It left me thinking, and I liked the quirky styles throughout it. Is it perfect? Of course not... But I felt entertained, and I would give it a shot."
" Meh
",2019-11-19 00:00:00,5,"It's alright but nothing special, so typically Western and empty like one of those books that teach you how to be happy in 10 steps.It's full of clichés and stereotypes and it's a bit insulting. Living in a poor, undeveloped or dangerous country doesn't not make people happy."
" Donut without a hole
",2019-09-06 00:00:00,6,"A TV movie that never manages to touch the viewer in depth. Too bad because there could be all the ingredients.
Maybe it's a problem of editing ...*seen in italian the 5th september 2019"
" Trite, clichéd, cringingly bad.
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,1,"Embarrassingly bad plot, dialogue, acting. A meaningless feelgood movie for disenchanted white middle aged, middle class professional men. Everything about this film is second rate. I watched it to see if it was a 10 or a 0. It's a zero."
" The Critics Are Idiots
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,8,"1. People who proclaim to be critics of life, have no idea what it is like to truly live.This is one of those special occasions when the public and the critic's opinion is utterly split. And here I am, from the party of filmmaker and life participant, to tell you who is correct. Well, in actuality, there is no ""correct"", just those who open themselves to be swept into the life of a movie. And if you are one of those, and not a soulless register of opinions, then watch this film, be happy, sad and scared, and keep on living :)"
" To quote from the movie, ""knocked it out of the park!""
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,10,"What an amazing voyage that could have been quite cliche, quite predictable, been superficial, or comedic at the cost of meaning. It was none of these. It was the best 2 hours spent in quite sometime watching what movies should be. Simon Pegg was at his best serving as the embodiment of the story tellers vision. Truly a wonderous film."
" Disappointing treatment of victim of sexual trafficking
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,4,"I was disappointed with the way in which sexual trafficking was eluded to in this film, and taken lightly. The Simon Pegg character sleeps with a prostitute who is then shouted at, hit and taken away from him whilst they are having lunch, by her pimp, because the pimp has realised that he has not been paid for this time (lunch) that the woman is spending with the character. The purpose of this incident, for the plot, is that Hector realises that he has only received attention from this beautiful woman because his friend paid for her time. He had not realised that she was a prostitute and he is disappointed because all is not as it seemed and he is not this great hot stuff. Towards the end of the film, there is another reference to the incident, where his 'psychic' patient tells him that he slept with a beautiful Chinese woman and he smiles, indulgently, as if this was a wonderful experience that he is glad he had. What about the woman? Clearly, that character was not there of her own free will. Clearly she was being exploited and abused. But that's okay because the main character gets to have a shag with a beautiful woman, that he would never have had, otherwise? How about if that was your sister/partner/friend/the girl who always put her hand up in class because she knew the answers? Shame on the film makers for treating this lightly."
" It had more potential
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,4,"I thought the movie was off to a great start but found it difficult to keep watching after the main character cheated on his wife (or girlfriend can't remember) It made for a very unlikable lead, Hector is probably my least favorite character Simon Pegg has ever played. It's a pretty film with nice landscapes but I didn't feel it was enough to make me want to ever watch it again, I really like the idea but I felt it was poorly executed"
" Made Me Happy
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,10,"It's a simple question. The film is about one man's search for happiness, but isn't an overly complex exploration, and doesn't try to be more than what it is. It will make you laugh, cry, and maybe think a little about life. Thoroughly enjoyable."
" Watch it if you want to know a simple meaning of Happiness.
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,7,"""Simon Pegg"" in a very sophisticated role, is taking us in a journey to discover happiness and its meanings.The movie starts slowly giving us a brief idea about his life, the complications he faces, and the main motivation to start the search for happiness.A good thing that you will get an answer, not a direct one, but your inner voice will be satisfied with the definitions given for happiness.""Simon Pegg"" acting is remarkable here, his soul is present in his actions and reactions, which made each scene runs smoothly. All other actors did great and the movie introduced them in a very brief way.The movie is a very light comedy, you will keep smiling the whole time, and may be laugh out loud in few scenes.The bad points mainly about the script and the plot, the events run from one point to another very quickly and some of the actions are not justified.Finally, it's a good light philosophical movie, not comparable to ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"", but they can be categorized together. You may feel bored a little bit especially in the first half of it but then enjoyment is guaranteed."
" can you be happy in your life
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,"Review: I loved this movie because it asks two important questions which are, Are we happy in our own life? and How do we achieve happiness. The direction and screenplay are both incredible. The casting and acting are both incredible also. Especially by Simon Pegg as Hector and Rosamund Pike as Clara. The cinematography is absolutely incredible also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars."
" Bad Sound. Story different from book. Bad actors.
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,1,"Bad Sound, one hardly can hear the actors. Story different from book. Bad actors."
" Watch this when you're lost and wanna find Happiness
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,9,"The happiness when you were playing, thinking when you were a kid was just alright! It was one of the messages of the professor that I remember the most. It's truely true! Find that feeling!People have their obligation to find their own happiness!"
" Yeah, give it a watch
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,6,"This is a sort of feel-good movie with aspirations of profundity and moralising (that seems to be a def fato inclusion for the Americans) although the source seems to be French (but I've not confirmed that).I'm being overly-picky (which comes of watching too many movies) but there's just a touch too many coincidences in it and although there are some 'light' moments, there are also some dark ones and I'm not sure that it truly qualifies as a 'comedy' unless they're also including 'odd moments of whimsy'.That aside, it's weird to see Simon Pegg in this role. and although he performs admirably, I'm not sure he's 100% suited to it. Him and Rosamund Pike? Well, stranger things have happened.But Pike is great and there's also Jean Reno - yay! - and Christopher Plummer in a cameo.I'm mainly being picky about the script but most folks won't notice. Yeah, go watch it. It's a bit of light fluff and may inspire you to,well, something. Or not..."
" Clichéd romantic comedy with some offensive stereotypes
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,3,"It is wrong to expect a movie based on a book (by the French author Francois Lelord) to be exactly like the original story; of course characters will be merged, scenes will be cut, etc. However, this film completely ditches the original quirky nature of the book. The story is turned into a shallow B grade romcom, with the narrative and ending just as predictable as you would expect.What it does retain of the book, and emphasizes even more, is its cardboard-cutout portrayal of people of non-white ethnicity. Women are there to decorate the lives of men; Africans (no specific country mentioned, because all of Africa is the same, right?) are violent gangsters or poor-but-happy-villagers, dancing around; Buddhist monks are wise and funny, etc, etc.Although Hector's Journey is even worse than ""Eat, Pray, Love"", if you are the kind of person who thought that was deep and meaningful, then you might like this, but otherwise don't bother with it."
" This movie should called "" how to be a Human"" or ""We gonna Put a big fat smile in your face"" :)
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,9,"This movie it gave me every thing I need, it made me smile, laugh, have tears in my eyes, scared and worried
its a prescription to cure and became just smily..its a good movie and the director you will see his marks its well directed film, and Simon Pegg thank you sir !
Go watch it,
and have a nice day and nice life"
" Fresh and stale bits
",2018-01-08 00:00:00,6,"This film came out to me as forced and formulaic. The lessons accumulates a bit too well and quickly to work out except for a couple of them that still sounded real, expecially the bit with the ex-girlfriend. It's strange that a psychiatrist would not know better about happiness, with all the studies about it. This film is more of a mid-life crisis needing a resolve. It's a bit overacted with the actual girlfriend that acts like a little girl but Rosamund is so damn cute and fun. Passable with good bits and not so good bits."
" Beautiful and heart warming!
",2017-11-14 00:00:00,9,"This movie reminds me a little bit of Walter Mitty at the beginning, but I really love Walter Mitty so I was not disappointed with this one. There are a lot of good sentences, and I really like that part at the end when Hector is in the isolation booth and speaking to Clara on the phone and has all emotions rushing trough him and they are like which one is it and there's just one sentence - It's all of them. So I think that's the best part of the movie, when you realize you need sadness, fear and happiness in order to feel alive. That's what makes life interesting. It's not all just about happiness. I think that movies has a good point and it's worth watching... and it has some really funny parts too!"
" Like an ad agency committee drafted movie
",2017-11-04 00:00:00,5,"Don't get me wrong, there were bits in this movie that were well done, but a lot of it rang hollow. Toni Collette's tear-down of Hector was good (but not much else about her character), Rosamund Pike's warmth, some other details, but then there was this creeping edge of ad agency feel good that undermined any real heart to the movie. He went to China not Tibet? He stays at the Marriott? Travels First Class, his paid for call girl takes him to a street cafe in a poor area? Why? A lot of it didn't add up but looked good for the camera. Some of the scenes were acted well and some of them rang very hollow. Ultimately for the subject the of honest happiness the shallow result left a bad taste."
" A True Hidden Gem
",2017-10-19 00:00:00,8,There is not much to say here. This is an awesome film. Light but profound at the same time. Unpretentious. Funny but heart felted. Beautifully crafted.A True Hidden Gem.I hope you can see this one with an open heart. You won't regret it.
" Journeys end in lovers meeting
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,7,"Simon Pegg is the titular Hector, a psychiatrist stuck in a pleasant rut, living a comfortable life in a beautiful apartment with hot girlfriend Clara (Pike), but still feeling inadequate to treat his patients.Hector decides to start a classic physical and metaphysical journey to discover what makes people happy. He leaves behind a shaky relationship and flies to China for some encounters with rich people and all that money can buy, followed by the inevitable meeting with a Buddhist monk.More traveling to Africa and Los Angeles brings Hector in contact with two old friends, both living happily, following their chosen path. Rather predictably Hector discovers that you could avoid going around the world searching for happiness, because it is not in the destination but in the pursuit. Also, that you'd better try to be happy in the moment because you don't know how long you have.Despite the oversimplified message, Pegg does a great job as Hector, playing his role with sensitivity. The scene with the terminal patient is particularly moving and not manipulative. I also liked the non excessive use of the notebook and Hector's childhood memories as visual complement.A remark about the Chinese ""student"": Hector is slightly naive and men tend to overestimate their attractiveness, but it is strange that Hector did not consider other motivations for the girl to join him in his room. Also, the gay angle felt sort of contrived. Otherwise, a perfect feel-good movie."
" Not bad at all
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,6,"I've read a lot of reviews for Hector & The Search For Happiness, and there's a common, and fairly petty gripe that seems to be a theme throughout them, pissing me off no end. In the film, Simon Pegg plays a wealthy psychiatrist with a solid career and a beautiful wife (Rosamund Pike). Deep down though, he feels empty, unfulfilled and as if something is missing, and embarks on a spontaneous, unplanned global voyage to essentially search for the meaning of happiness, or at his own on the smaller scale. Now, a few critics have this whiny sentiment that because he's well off, stable and lucky in life (I won't even use the dreaded 'P' word), that it's somehow offensive to see him search for more, or find himself unhappy. He ventures forth to places like Tokyo, L.A. and Africa in his travels and it seems to be some consensus that because he runs into people from third world areas who haven't been dealt as lucky a hand as he has, materially speaking at least, that he has no right to complain or contest his position or mindset in life. Absolute butthurt. Everyone on this planet, be they billionaires, orphans, middle class mothers, movie stars or refugees, everyone is going through their own private set of problems and inner turmoil, and no one has the right to so blindly insist that some people's problems, mental and/or material, matter more than others just because they have more money or resources than. The richest, most capable individuals could be going through hell on the inside, and they deserve to be acknowledged and sympathized with just as much as anyone else. Grow up. Now that my rant is over, on to the film, which is somewhat of an oddball and not easy to define, genre-wise. The posters and trailers make it out to be one of those quirky 'find yourself' comedy dramas where some plucky misfit goes on a journey, meets various archetypal characters and discovers a bunch about themselves, until the inevitable revelation that caps their story. Well, it is that, and it kind of isn't as well. It's certainly structured like that from beginning to end, but at times it gets quite dark, more than merely momentarily, and has far more of a brain in it's head, both in terms of script and technical execution, than you would see coming. Pegg feels adrift in his profession, smothered by his doting but high maintenance wife and needs that leap into the unknown, which he takes. His first encounter is with a cynical hotshot businessman (Stellen Skarsgard), a man who lives in planes, airports, hotels and nightclubs, filling his time with life's pleasures and the power of commerce, yet fully aware of what else he's missing out on, perhaps the reason he is drawn to Pegg's character. Over to Africa next, where he spends time with relief workers, to see if fulfillment can indeed be found in selflessly aiding others, but things turn intense when he's captured by scary rebels and somewhat befriends a volatile arms dealer (nice to see Jean Reno, who's been laying low these days) with a sad secret of his own. His trip takes him to the states, where he reconnects with an old flame (Toni Colette), no doubt allured by the sweet promise of nostalgia, a powerful force that doesn't always yield happiness when adhered to. A loopy self help guru (Christopher Plummer), Skype sessions with Pike back in England and other encounters beset him, and in the end we wonder what the point of it all was, but this is his journey, not ours. I like that it doesn't necessarily follow a blueprint that we're used to, moves forward in fits and starts, meanders a bit, even veering into thriller territory briefly, his path truly an unforeseeable one that could lead anywhere based on chance, timing and the decisions he makes. That's the mark of a good script, one that surprises and confounds in the best possible of ways, and shirks all labels applied to the final product, arriving on our screens as something just weird enough to be memorable and just this side of accessible in order to not be too much of an off-putting black sheep. Interesting stuff."
