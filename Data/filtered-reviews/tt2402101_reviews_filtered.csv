" Disappointing (5.5/10)
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,5,"I had just finished reading Gillian Flynn's novel with high expectations for this movie, but in the end, it felt more like a chore than anything else.I have a lot of complaints. One of my biggest complaints was the pacing. It dragged on. The other huge complaints are the castings and the changes in the fundamental plot elements from the book to the screen.In the end, it just felt underwhelming. I think if this film was longer, it wouldn't be so bad. I also think rearranging some scenes would help the movie flow better. Sadly that's not the case as it's a jumbled butchered film of Flynn's novel Dark Places."
" Inconsistent age differences.
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,5,"In 2015, Charlie Theron turned 40. Diondra's daughter looks no older than 20 (or early 20's). So either the daughter is supposed to be 30 or older, or Charlize is playing someone in her late 20's or early 30's (and other present day update characters are also playing well below their age). Other than that, quite effective, but this glaring fault did ruin it for me."
" Enjoyed the movie
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed the movie but all I could think of while watching was how Charlize Theron was miscast for the role of Libby. Theron played the part like an angry rebellious teen.I love Theron as an actress, but this part wasn't meant for her. She looked too glamorous for the role, and her wardrobe didn't help, wearing a baseball cap throughout the movie made her look ridiculous, like she was trying to play some young angry ""I don't wanna be bothered"" teen.I rated the movie a 7 because I felt the story was suspenseful and intriguing."
" Charlize Therons worst movie and performance and I'm a HUGE fan!! Pass on this 1
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,1,"This movie is easily summed up....BORING, Charlize must have just wanted a pay check as she just meanders through the movie with a mediocre performance at best. Terrible directing and a story consisting of to many flashbacks and it's about a crime that happened 30 years a go that we just dont care about. If you're a mystery fan or a Charlize fan stay away from this!!!"
" Too slow
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,4,"This movie moves like molasses. If u have time to kill, it is ok."
" The crime scenes were too dark.
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,4,"I didn't care for this. It was listed as a horror film which it's not. Charlize Theron plays Libby Day the now grown up girl who witnessed the murder of her mother & sisters when she was 7. It's one of those movies done in flash backs. The flash backs are very dark & I couldn't make out what was happening. The next problem is that Libby Day has grown up to be distrusting, & sullen. She's depressed, unsocialable, & unable to even make eye contact with anyone. She's not functioning as an adult well enough to hold a job. She hides under an ugly baseball cap & barely talks to anyone. So the main character of the movie is a boring drag & I couldn't of cared less about her. I didn't understand the end. All the jumping back & forth in time made things confusing. The scenes of the past murders were in the night & were too dark to see. I didn't like this. It's not a horror movie. It's a slow unclear crime mystery drama done in too dark flashbacks."
" Meh
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,3,"Just another boring average or below violent, depressing,F word filled movie that didn't need to be made. The ending wasn't even good."
" Surprisingly Good!!!
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,8,"Didn't expect this to be so good. Great movie, great twists."
" Confusing
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,5,"This movie jumps back-and-forth from one. to another. Which is kind of confusing because it happens so frequently. There's also an unexplained occurrence that makes no sense. So this is a spoiler.The guy that she hired to kill her, took a shot gun and killed one of the daughters. Why? He wasn't supposed to kill the whole family, just the mother. Correct?"
" Dark Places (2015)
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,6,"Funny that a film buff such as myself has never heard of this film. A Charlize Theron vehicle is always something I am down for. Upon looking into the film, this is based on the novel by Gilian Flynn who also wrote Sharp Objects and Gone Girl, both of which received the adaptation treatment. I liked both as well, both being anchored by very strong lead performances in Amy Adams and Rosamund Pike. I wanted more of the same here but wow. This film feels like a tonal mess and the twists just fail to live up to the build of the film.
The film is about a woman who is famous because her sisters and her mother were brutally murdered as a child. Her brother has been imprisoned for the crime and she got buy on funding by people who felt bad for her having to experience such a heinous tragedy. In need of cash, she meets up with a fan club who look into true crime events and analyze it. They peak her interest on whether her brother really committed the murders or if there was more to the story. She investigates and finds that looking for the truth is a dangerous ask.
Charlize does what she can with the script but its just so unimpressive and cluttered. Tonally, this film doesn't know what it wants to be. The beginning up until when Theron meets the Kill Club feels like a horror. Then it switches between horror and drama and by the end the flashbacks and the ""twists"" just ruin whatever the film was building towards. I don't know if the book was like this, I'm assuming its better as Flynn has received acclaim for her other works but maybe she should have supervised this script like she did with Fincher's film.
You can feel like this film could have been something special if things were done differently but it just never reaches that point. Instead, large portions are plodding and uninteresting and the twists are unimpressive. Also, I don't know if shes a good or bad actress yet but Chloe Moretz is really bad in this. Now I know why I've never heard of this film. It just couldn't set suspense or thrill or story up properly. This definitely felt like a Lifetime or made for TV movie that uncharacteristically had big names attached.6/10"
" Disappointed
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,2,"I've always been a fan of Charlize Theron. She is a wonderful actress. But the allure is missing here. Her star presence gone, got trapped by series of flashback and so forth. The plot not so engaging about a woman who seek the truth of what happenned 30 years ago. But I managed to sit through because I hope there would be some interesting things involving but lastly I was glad to see the end credits roll out."
" Boringggg
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,4,"Dark Places is my favorite book of all time and this movie does not do it justice: the pacing feels rushed and drags at the same time - something I didn't even think was possible. Everything happens so quickly, but, unlike in its original format, it feels emotionless and lazy.Charlize Theron is a fantastic actress, but she does not portray Libby Day properly; she feels too ""badass"" for lack of a better term whereas I feel Libby is supposed to be more awkward and tense. Additionally, I love ChloÃ« Grace Moretz but she portrays Diondra as more of a stupid kid than the dirty psychopath she was in the book.Granted, this book would be very difficult to adapt into a film because of the many flashback sequences and, for the most part, the movie does stay true to the book, but overall, I definitely enjoy the book much more and feel this movie could have been a lot better."
" Not bad but the book is much better
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,7,"This is a decent adaptation from the Gillian Flynn novel but it feels toned down. I thought it would feel a lot more southern gothic or something from reading the book. Ben and Ds relationship is way more messed up in the book and the story is more horrific and tense. This is fine for what it is but the books prose makes up for a fairly straight forward plot, the movie makes that even more apparent, I think. It is a bit different than a typical story like this though, and has decent acting. Worth a watch still, imo."
" Dark Places
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,4,"Theron plays the survivor, of a family massacre from her youth, who has continued to believe in the guilt of her brother and has survived on the profits from a book about the murder and general charity. Amateur mystery enthusiast Hoult comes along and suggest there may be another solution.Despite some seriously good performances by Theron, Sheridan and Moretz, this is somewhat convoluted and mentally draining, particularly when in the company of Theron's intransigent central character. It clears itself up nicely as it reaches its climax but there is just too much messy foreplay to make this the thriller it could have even."
" Disturbing, dark and complex
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,6,"Based on the novel by Gillian Flynn, Dark Places is about the gruesome massacre of Patty Day (Christina Hendricks) and her two young daughters on a fateful night of 1985 at their country farmhouse in Kansas. There were two members of the household that survived the death fest, Patty's 14 year old son Ben and her youngest daughter Libby, 8 years old. Ben, who was then accused of participating in cult and anti-Christ practices and child molestation in a day care school, is arrested on the charges of mass murder, doesn't protest or appeal and Libby corroborated the charges in the courtroom.Cut to 28 years later, Ben is still serving his life sentence and Libby (Charlize Theron) does nothing in particular having extinguished all the social financial support and the royalty earned from the sale of the book published to narrate the events of the Day family tragedy. She is now contacted by Lyle Wirth (Nicolas Hoult) who is acting on behalf of a group of investigators and journalists who believe that Ben was wrongfully punished for the crimes he didn't commit. Unwilling to cooperate initially, Libby is lured into leading the investigation that could potentially falsify her own judgement, memories and statements from her childhood because she sees financial benefits from the deal. As she reconnects with Ben and follows certain leads with the help of Lyle, she slowly starts to uncover the truth behind her dark past and a secret that devastated her family and led to the brutal murders.Dark Places is perhaps not as cutting edge a thriller as Flynn's other novels like Sharp Objects or Gone Girl are, but certainly plays hard on human psychology, projecting the dark, complex and disturbing aspects of our minds. The suspense is baffling in the end although not really overwhelming and devastating. Charlize Theron shines in her role of the disturbed, indifferent and hardened Libby that was once a lovable little girl."
" Really good, but fizzles out at the end.
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,6,"I was gripped watching this movie. The story, the way it unfolded was, well, it had me hooked. I cared what happened... I was curious what happened, but when I saw what happened, it was like, ""....... oh.""That conclusion (for me) did not match the rest of the movie.
To me, if they wanted to go 'that way' for the ending, then to me, the backstory and backstory confusion, and Ben's story, and basically all the other Ben stuff needed wayyyyy more time.
(I know it's based in a book, I wonder of all that backstory stuff gets more attention in the book... I'm about to find out.)I gave it a 6 instead of a 2 because I really did like everything except the final reveal. Had it not been for a likable cast, that ending would've really sunk the movie for me.I'd recommend it with the footnote: You won't be satisfied."
" Poor casting
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,3,"Ummmm....let's pay attention to the plot. If Ben had a daughter, she'd be about 27 1/2. No way that actress was 27 1/2. And at this point, why hide? Stupid."
" The Angel of Debt
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,8,"Set like 'In Cold Blood' in Kansas, nearly everybody in this adaptation of Gillian Flynn's 2009 novel is touching somebody else for money, the murder of Charlize Theron's mother and siblings is financially motivated and Theron herself only agrees to reinvestigate their deaths because she herself badly needs the money.Structurally it rather resembles Kubrick's 'The Killing', except that here events nearly thirty years apart gradually intertwine as parallel narratives played out concurrently in screen time, while in Kubrick's film separate but concurrent strands are teased apart and laid end to end. Unfortunately this exercise in non-linear storytelling is very hard to follow for those who haven't read the book, and the film probably needs to seen twice to make sense of it."
" Ugh...... waste of an hour
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,2,"The main character just isn't believable.. struggling, corny dialogue.. I can't Believe I lasted an hour. What a waste"
" Based on a acclaimed book
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,6,A decent story line from person that brought us Gone Girl.
" Mmmm...mixed bag. Started out promising. Started nagging me half way through. Left behind with a disappointing feeling. Could have been better, but was NOT.
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,5,"I love Charlize Theron. She is great. She acts well. The story starts out promising. But it lacks credibility half way through and it doesnt recover from that lack of credibility. Not bad, simply not great.The good: the acting.
The bad: the credibility. And since it is meant to be a true to life drama, credibility is paramount. But it is nowhere to be found."
" A nice thriller
",2019-12-06 00:00:00,7,"Started watching it on a premium channel, and got interested and watched it all. A thriller with a twist!"
" Can watch...quite boring
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,5,The protogonist Libby try to finds their family murderer and also she wrote one book about that murder.it is a non-linear screenplay...little boring and not good photography
" Run away from this film!
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,3,"I read that this film barely earned $200,000 in its limited theatrical release. No big surprise.It's dismal and pathetic from start to finish. I almost turned it off about two thirds of the way through, but I hung in to the conclusion. I'm sorry I did.Charlize Theron goes through horror and violence, all the time with perfect makeup, looking like a multi-million dollar movie star. Give me a break. A woman whose has lived with the murder of her family for 30 years is going to show some wear and tear. Theron looks like she just came from the spa.The mother's decision is so absurdly over top, I can imagine audiences laughing in the theaters.The brother doesn't elicit any sympathy, either. Yeah, most teenagers do stupid things, but not this stupid. His choice of girlfriends is so bad, it's inexplicable.The theme of satan worship is ridiculous. What fun, watching stoned teenage kids slaughter cows.The ending is supposed to be upbeat, all about redemption and justice. Problem is, the film has sunk so low, the happiest ending in the world can't pull it out of the muck.Run from this one. Run fast."
" Captivating thriller
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,7,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this thriller. It has a good flow with the parallel storytelling and the slow unravel of past and present events. The final reveal was unexpected, which I always enjoy. I thought the acting was good, especially with Theron. It's not a typical thriller and shows the darker side of being the lone survivor."
" Extremely Underrated Film - Spoiler Alerts
",2019-07-30 00:00:00,8,"Spoiler Alerts: Ignore what the critics have said and check this great very dark mystery film:I literally watched this film yesterday and was blown away at how fantastic the film is on many levels. Gillian Flynn is an excellent writer and has three novels: Gone Girl, Sharp Objects, and Dark Places that have all been brought to the screen as movies or a mini series. Her stories are all DARK and DISTURBING and in my opinion each translation from novel to film has been fantastic.The acting was phenomenal from Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Chloe Grace Moretz, Corey Stoll and the rest of the cast. I have always loved Christina Hendricks who I did not even realized was in the film as she is unrecognizable at first. She delivers an amazing performance.Yes, the material is very disturbing and very real in my opinion and not for everyone. This is darker than Gone Girl and almost as dark as Sharp Objects in my opinion. However, the poor reviews prove more and more to me that critics are wrong most of the time."
" If you've read the book, this movie won't do it for you..
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,3,"This movie felt rushed, and so many of the details that made the book so good were ignored or rushed through. The movie also didn't feel dark enough, gritty enough or really represent the desolate, poor, rural winter setting from the books. It felt watered down and the characters felt wrong. Charlize Theron is literally the opposite of Libby from the books. I wish the team that did Sharpe Objects from HBO could take this story on to really create a creepy, girtty, dark story."
" my notes
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,7,Great movie with an intriguing story that kept me into it throughout the movie. good discovery process and non-linear story telling. great cast (1 viewing)
" ""The truly frightening flaw in humanity is our capacity for cruelty - we all have it.""
",2019-06-08 00:00:00,6,"Libby, as an eight-year-old, survived the massacre of her family. A few decades later, an association of amateurs investigating famous murders, ""The Kill Club"", is asking her to help them resolve that old case. She reluctantly accepts and the mystery begins to unwind, revealing unexpected truths.""Dark Places"" is a film that is drowning in mediocrity. It is not written badly, but there is nothing to praise either. The acting is not bad, but nobody's performance will leave you breathless. I was not bored, but if I skipped it, I would not miss much. I do not recommend it, not because it is bad, but because there are a million better things you could watch instead.6/10"
" Excitement
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,8,It's slow but suspensful.Keeps us guessing till end and it's taken well.A very good watching experience
" WASTE OF TIME
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,2,Borrrrrrrrrrrringg !!!!!!! AND clihe ! the lead actress is hot tho........ but anywas.... BAD MOVIE
" Hey! I watched this flop
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,6,"Yesterday I noticed this on my Netflix and thought well since I loved Gone Girl and Sharp Objects this should be up to par in terms of quality.So I checked out this and while honestly it was a bit extra slowburn with weak direction (if you compare it to Fincher's or Vallee's) it came out quite not as bad as it flopped at the box office. It had a good cast who gave good performance and the twist was good, definitely Charliz Theron was not at her peak but I found the story having good flow and honestly I wouldn't mind rewatching if this came on TV but wish it caught the attention of a better director that could give it justice."
" Not a bad adaptation
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,7,"I recently read Dark Places, and decided I'd give the movie a go after enjoying the TV adaptation of Sharp Objects. All in all they did a good job at it, but the book, as usual is much better. I also found some of the changes a bit odd and I don't really understand why they made those changes.
Not a bad film, but if you're a reader, stick with the book first."
" Interesting enough
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,6,Keeps you in it. Has you constantly trying to figure out what actually happened. Not bad with quality actress like Charlize Theron. Some good supporting young actors are good. I pushed to the end and liked it a lot. Stay with it on your day off or movie night. Won't blow you away but it will keep you engaged.
" Dark Places Is Hard To Swallow
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,5,"Dark Places is a quirky movie that pushes the boundaries of believability to the breaking point. The one plus is at least it's not one of Hollywood's usual rehashed remakes or a comic book hero saga, but that's about the extent of it's good points.Charlize Theron is miscast as the main character, Libby Day, (but when you're the executive producer you can OK the casting of yourself in the lead role) and plays her like a mediocre copy of her 'Monster' character. Evidently, she has spent the past 28 years as a single, man-hating woman with a masculine swagger. Nicholas Hoult, who I always enjoy, has a minimal role here (which is a shame) as Lyle Worth, who portrays the leader of a 'kill club' that investigates old murders. Chloe Grace Moretz is spot-on as Diondra, the murdering pregnant girlfriend. She always seems to play creepy young females, and does so flawlessly.Some of the unbelievable plot line questions (SPOILER ALERT)...why would Libby Day's brother prefer to spend nearly 30 years in prison protecting his girlfriend, who chokes his little sister to death? Why would Libby's mother decide to hire someone to kill her while her 3 young daughters are in the house? And speaking of the killer, how does someone get away with offering his services as a killer who assists in suicides so the victim's family can collect insurance money and apparently never gets caught, even though he appears to be well known for his specialty (does he have an ad in the yellow pages?)? How does the murdering girlfriend know that Libby called Lyle to come get her, and then disappears when he shows up? And apparently Diondra's daughter was just born bad, as her mother told her everything about her murderous past and she chooses to be her willing murdering accomplice.Not the best who-done-it, but not the worst either."
" Episodic narrative
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,5,Charlize Theron does some fine acting. Beyond that the narrative has an episodic feel with a convenient ending.
" It's a wth
",2018-08-14 00:00:00,5,I don't know if this movie had potential or not. It could have used a better writer I can tell you that. It was all over the place and so pointless and insane. Theron was so manly looking in here that it was hard to watch her. I think the dark places was titled appropriately because the movie was in a lot of dark places plot-wise.
" Yawn
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,2,"I created an account just to leave the 2 star rating this movie deserves. Not a thrilling moment, character to care about or coherent storyline to be found here. This may be the most disjointed story I've ever had the misfortune of seeing. Fifteen minutes in and I couldn't have cared less what actually happened to the family or who was responsible. The satanic ritual side story had NOTHING to do with the plot whatsoever and totally could have been left out. Charlize Theron, who's typically great, was obviously phoning in this performance. Please, do yourself a favor, watch something else. Anything else!"
" Couldn't stay awake
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,6,"The sideline was good, but it moved very slow. I restarted this move 6 times before I could finish it. (I'm a little obsessive about movies and books. If I start it, I have to see ot through.) This movie is not for everyone. But overall it didn't suck."
" Better Luck Next Time
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,3,"A quick note to the director and writers. If there was a story in this film, you totally destroyed it by shooting half the action in almost complete dark. You might think that's cool but it fact it ruined the whole film because after listening to disembodied voices for about five minutes I totally lost interest. If its any consolation, you're not the only ones who have ruined what could have been a decent movie, by shooting it in the dark. Next time, challenge yourself and shoot the majority of the scenes in daylight. Its a pity to ruin a story with something as elementary as lighting."
" Just plain horrible
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,3,"Boring, no pace, horrible script. Just don't waste your time with this garbage."
" Implausible above and beyond
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,3,"About good thrillers, they need to suspend audiences with darkness. This one did not. Its excessive plots spoiled over common reasoning. I had hard time to follow the irrational storyline which killed my curiosity eventually.Employing hit men carrying out murders in order to receive insurance payments is a common scheme since the invention of insurance. However, the author might think she reinvented the scenario, she did not. She indeed facilitated a lot of horrors to resonate audience with the crimes. But it failed to deliver thrills and chills unlike ""Gone Girl"" ultimately did.Psychopathic scenarios are deployed into thriller often. Some of them truly horrified audiences to the core. Yet, this one failed to do so. The reason might be it intended to tempt audiences with realities. Audiences were rarely bothered by the probablities of ""Gone Girl"" happening in real lives. Moreover, just like other successful thrillers, ""Silence of Lamb"", ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" even ""The Girl on the Train"" were primary focused on those coincidences and contrived stories which would be implausibly happened for real even when all stars align in the sky.Documentaries are for the reality. Even though they are still done with some explainable coincidences to entice audiences. Directors only have one choice to make great thrillers which is weaving all the impossibilities together and bringing to the screen without concerning any probable realities in them. This one unfortunately mocked that."
" Unique story telling, compelling case!
",2018-05-05 00:00:00,8,"I love the storyline!visually it's dark and the limited viewing during those times can cause confusion. It's tone is also a little depressing, but it comes from a unique stand point has has many layers to the story which is compelling til the end.I do think there was room for improvement, but by that I mean it could have reached storyline perfection for me, totally my kind of story"
" Very lame thriller
",2018-05-02 00:00:00,2,"This so-called thriller came and went without too many people seeing it. It's about a mass family killing that happened in 1985 and how those events impact on the one surviving member, the little girl who grows up to be Charlize Theron and who is encouraged by a young stranger, (Nicholas Hoult), to help prove the innocence of her brother who was convicted for the killings. The film jumps back and forth in time, sometimes almost within the same shot, and it's a device that proves something of a novelty but doesn't make the film interesting. It's all very lame and a good cast is mostly wasted on sub-standard material. Only a dowdy Christina Hendricks as the murdered mom shows exactly what she's capable of."
" Disjointed
",2018-04-29 00:00:00,4,"Unbelievable, disjointed. Charlize disappointing. Lost interest after 30 mins. Flashbacks are so annoying!"
" American crime noir
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,6,"DARK PLACES is a slow-paced and realistic slice of American crime with a slightly muddled storyline. The narrative is split between two time frames, the present day and the historical past, but the present day plotting is rather weak and limited despite the presence of established stars including Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult in the cast. The historical story is much more interesting and involves the build-up to a family massacre which has an eventual reveal that you certainly won't see coming. The film utilises the real-life Satanism scare of the 1990s to good effect and keeps you watching in order to find out the answers, although it's not a movie that you'll come back to once you've found out what really did happen."
" Sometimes things have to die
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,9,"Libby Day (Charlize Theron) has trouble remembering events on the night her family was murdered. Her testimony put her brother Ben (Tye Sheridan) in jail. He was accused of molesting an eleven year old girl and he was a Satan worshiper hanging out with the wrong crowd. Years after the deed, Libby is running low on funds and contacts the Kill Club who want to investigate the murders. They believe Ben is innocent. Libby is reluctant to help. As she starts to look at the material, she too is sucked into the mystery.The film uses flashbacks to recreate what happened in the past. It drops clues, in fact it drops enough clues, that you have more suspects than a half dozen Scooby-Doo episodes...including Ben. The film is based on a popular novel by the same name. It takes place in Kansas and moves at a pace that strings you along as the clues and flashbacks ooze out slowly.Guide: F-bomb. Sex. Near stripper nudity."
" I was like meh throughout the entire movie....
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,4,"I just read the book and decided to watch the movie, thinking that with this strong compelling story the film would be great. Wrong. It was so flat and boring it made me forget how good the story really was. I didn't have any problem with the casting (especially with young Ben Day, I think he was really good) but the whole tone of the film was stiff and had me saying ""whatever..."". The music wasn't good, the characters were so one dimensional and what really bugged me was the flashback scenes and the fact that there was no other suspects. In the book you keep changing your mind about who's the killer every chapter but in the movie it's pretty clear from the start. The flashbacks did not portray what was really going on, so when we slowly uncover the truth we do not really care... Even the scene of the murders were plain and boring. I don't understand how could someone take this story and turn it into this. So disappointed. I know that in order to make a movie you have to cut a lot of things out of a book, but it feels like it lost its great character, their emotions and the mood. Finally I forgot to mention that the casting for today's Ben Day character was so wrong."
" Not that good of a movie
",2017-11-30 00:00:00,4,"Dark Places:Rating: shaky I got mixed feelings about this movie, though it is very intense. I liked the whole idea of the killer club (a group of people interested in crimes doing their own investigation), but felt as though they should've been involved more in the film.A major problem which absolutely didn't stick well with me in this film is when Lyle (member of killer club) who really isn't involved in the film, contacted Libby about information, it came out of nowhere. When, where and how, there is nothing to show the viewers how he got it."
" Weak and uninspired
",2017-11-08 00:00:00,4,"While the book was at least okay, the film is simply uninspired and doesn't explore the material in a way that the more or less complex story seems coherent and interesting. The psychological abysses of the characters are ignored in the script, Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult, being the talented actors they are, definitely had the potential to save the weak story adaption, but I was surprised to see their acting halfhearted and wooden."
" Intriguing, well done mystery/drama
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,8,"Dark Places is a multi genre movie. It's got a lot of mystery and thriller throughout, it's also got a whole lot of drama, given what the characters go through. The cast is absolutely wonderful. Charlize Theron was a perfect casting choice for the lead role of Libby Day. She plays her role with a sense of strength but also a lot of pain from her past and vulnerability. Nicholas Hoult was good, his character wasn't really a game changer here but nevertheless he's good. Chloe Grace Moretz was very impressive here, she plays a very dark character, and she pulls it off effortlessly. The plot is very interesting and the movie executes it very well. It keeps you invested the entire way through, mostly because it makes you care for its characters and you want to know the truth about what happened. The film doesn't disappoint in the end. It satisfies in the end, I was very happy with the result of what actually happened and with how the characters ended up. I definitely encourage everyone who likes this type of movie to watch it. You won't be let down. 8/10 for Dark Places."
" Perfect Unfolding
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,7,"In 1985 the entire Day family was killed with the exception of one little girl, Libby Day, and her brother, Ben Day. Ben was arrested and convicted for the crime with the help of Libby Day's testimony. 30 years later the case is being reinvestigated by Libby (Charlize Theron) and a weird true crime devoted club known as Killer Club.This is a true mystery that unfolds bit by bit just as a well written mystery should. The movie takes its time to reveal small nuggets from Libby's memory as well as the actual happenings of the fateful event. With the captivating writing and above-average acting you are treated to a superior crime mystery."
" Thriller Whodunnit
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,8,"Based on the Gillian Flynn book of the same name. Flynn also wrote Gone Girl.As far as movies go - Gone Girl was better.This was an acceptable entertaining thriller. But, well the book was just better. They can't put everything in the movie and often times things are changed radically.This was good and definitely worth the rental. Just not as good as the book..."
" A haunting film
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,10,"Lets make clear that I am not aware of the book that this film was based on, so I am not gonna review the movie all about the book. I am not even sure if it is important if the movie was based on the book exactly the same in every detail. From my point of view, this movie has no flaw. Everything was sticking together very good. The plot was terrific, always on edge, characters and story very well put together, and if I could characterize this film with one word, this would be SUSPENSE. I stopped the movie some times to calm down, I was blown away from the rising tension and in the climax scenes always on the edge of my seat. This film blends together so many elements about the history of this era in Kansas city and in America in general, when development of satanic rituals among teenagers had shocked the news and society. Also, when criminal rates are high enough to let their footprint and create a bloodstained and ""dark place"" in the citizen's hearts. The unsolved mystery murders of this movie is a riddle that unfolds throughout the whole movie, with exquisite use of flashbacks, sound effects and irresolute but determining character development. For me this movie is undoubtedly 10/10. It is powerful, enigmatic and stunning in a way that will make you think of it some time. After all, this movie is important for one main reason. Its twist will never let you guess what happens, only when you finish the movie, you can finally find redemption through Libby's eyes when she visits for a last time her family home and gets free forever. This is a happy end, without fake drama. It is life itself and even if it had spoken lies in the end rises the truth."
" Really? A 6.2?
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,8,"From 2015, ""Dark Places"" stars Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Christina Hendricks, and Corey Stoll in an adaptation of a novel by Gillian Flynn (Gone Girl).Theron is Libby Day, one of two living survivors of the mass murder of her family in 1985 in Kansas. Where else - it's where the murders in In Cold Blood took place. The other survivor is her brother Ben (Stoll), a teen at the time, who has been in prison for the last 25 years for the murders, due to what she told the police.Libby is a cold, closed-off human being, understandably, given what she went through as a child; she cashed in on the murders and never worked. As a child people sent her money, and she also wrote a book -- well, her name was on it and she was paid, but she states that she never even read it. Now that she's an adult, she has $412 left and has never had a job. So when she's approached by a crime club called the Kill Club, which discusses and works on famous murder cases, she takes their money to make an appearance.Though she insists her brother is guilty, Libby takes more money to actually investigate for the club's president (Hoult). It has to be done right away because storage problems in the state building mean that cases more than ten years old will be destroyed in a few weeks.Flashbacks recreate the circumstances surrounding the murders, showing her mother (Hendricks) trying to hold onto their farm despite poverty, her alcoholic husband who shows up for money, Ben being accused of child molestation and of practicing Satanism, and Ben's relationship with Diondra (Chloe Grace Moretz), who seems to be the town bad girl.Slowly Libby is able to put the pieces together and learns the stunning truth.I don't understand the vilification of this movie - what has it ever done to anyone? A 26% fresh on rottentomatoes.com. Was it Hate Charlize Day or what? This is a terrific, suspenseful film that will keep you guessing right to the end.Theron gives a frosty performance, right on for this isolated, unfriendly woman who has cut herself off from the world and people. She wears a baseball cap throughout most of the film; we don't really get to see her true beauty unless it's off. There is a book called ""Flesh and Fantasy"" which has a chapter on How to Win an Oscar. One way is for a beautiful movie star to make herself look bad, as Theron did in Monster. She prefers to make films that are not about her gorgeous looks, and this was one.Christina Hendricks does a great job as Libby's downtrodden mother - she looks and acts defeated - a far cry from being one of the glamorous stars of ""Mad Men.""For fans of this genre, and I gather for people who haven't read the book, I think this is a very well done film that deserves to be seen as a rental or on Amazon streaming."
" Production/Reception Problems Don't Nearly Sink This One (Despite Their Best Efforts)
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,7,"A few years ago, Gillian Flynn's novel ""Gone Girl"" was turned into a film that received Academy Award consideration. While I won't go so far as to say that ""Dark Places"" is quite as good as that one, there must have been something going on behind the scenes in the production that really hampered its marketing. It doesn't nearly deserve the terrible reputation it is receiving right now.For a basic plot summary, ""Dark Places"" tells the story of Libby Day (Charlize Theron), a woman still haunted by the memory of a childhood incident in which her brother murdered the rest of the family...or did he? Down to her last dollar and no longer able to exploit public sympathy, Libby hooks on with a group of murder investigators/enthusiasts led by Lyle Wirth (Nicholas Hoult), who pay her to re-examine that infamous past night. The lead-up to the massacre is told in flash-backs, featuring Ben Day (Tye Sheridan & Corey Stoll) as the supposed killer and mother Patty (Christine Hendricks) as the mother hanging on by a thread. What really happened that night? That won't be determined until the final memories begin falling into place.To me, ""Dark Places"" matches up pretty favorably with ""Gone Girl"" (I actually liked this one even better as a book than I did ""Gone Girl""). They both have a pretty respectable cast (even Chloe Moretz has a key role in this), they both feature a psychological thriller/mystery at the heart of the narrative, and both are thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end.So, why did ""Gone Girl"" soar while ""Dark Places"" puttered out? There seemed to be very little advertising for ""Dark Places"", it premiered in very few theaters, and came to home video right away. There is also a sense (while watching the film) that the production value isn't quite as good as maybe it could be. Not overly detrimentally to the experience, by any means, but also not quite as polished as ""Gone Girl"". It felt a little bit cobbled together and stunted when it could have been just as great and nuanced as its Flynn-inspired predecessor.Overall, though, ""Dark Places"" is a pretty solid movie that (for whatever reason) gained such a bad reputation that it flopped early and often. If you enjoyed the book, though, I think you will like this one just as much. Don't be scared away by a few bad reviews and some terrible score markings on other websites...it isn't nearly that bad!! Had some of the kinks been worked out of it, it could have been a lot more well-received."
" A messed up situation that created some messed up people
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,"A very appropriate title for a messed up situation that created some messed up people. I am biased with Charlize, but this was well done and an entertaining yet twisted tale. If you are a fan of her work you won't be disappointed. The rest of the cast was enjoyable also. I hear the book was good too."
" Disappointing
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,2,"I had just finished reading the book and found that the movie was on Stan. I know it is hard to fit a lot of a book into the movie, but they could at least have got some of the basic facts right. The very beginning the amount she has left in the bank is wrong, the number of years since the trial is wrong and even the name of the debt collector is wrong.She says her aunt is dead but in the book she is still alive. There is not enough of the back story of Ben, Diondra and Trey to explain what happened. So many inconsistencies it ruined the movie for me. Maybe with a better cast they could have sold the story better."
" Worth one watch, but doesn't offer anything extraordinary
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"Of course I'd hate to compare Dark Places to Gone Girl all through this review, but Gone Girl had a big effect on me. So obviously the first thing I notice is the difference between Amy and Libby. Amy is clever and ambitious, while Libby doesn't seem to care about anything. They both had money though, money they didn't exactly earn themselves. Amy got her money from her parents, and Libby got her money from generous donors. Both lose their money, but the biggest difference seems to be that Amy is active while Libby is passive turning active. Still, Libby is an interesting character. She has gone through a lot and has clearly put up some walls, and the movie keeps us at a certain distance from her. I feel like we could get to know her a lot better in the novel, which is why I'm really interested in reading that. To be honest the distance from the main character of Dark Places and Gone Girl shows the key difference between the film adaptations. Gone Girl's screenplay was written by Gillian Flynn herself, and in the movie we get to know Amy. We don't get to know as much as in the novel, but we know enough, while with Libby the audience doesn't know enough. Maybe the screenwriter didn't know ""his"" character as well as he would need to. But of course this is kind of in theory, since I haven't read the novel, but judging by Flynn's style in Gone Girl, I doubt she'd leave the main character at a weird distance. What's great about the story is how you can guess what happened. You know who could've been behind it, and you can form your own theories. I formed mine very early, but knowing Flynn I felt like it's not going to be what I guessed. Well, that was disappointing, because I guessed it right. Again, I feel like in the novel it might have been a bit harder to find it out before it was said, but in a movie those few clues can't be drown in as many details as would be necessary. That's what let me kind of disappointed, that and the fact that the feeling after you see or read Gone Girl is... haunting. That's what haunting about that story. But with Dark Places, the end just is. The feeling is completely different. Of course I'm not expecting every story of Flynn's feeling the same, but Dark Places doesn't feel as dark as Gone Girl.The atmosphere - cinematography and music - of Dark Place are very typical for a thriller, and when looking at those Dark Places just drowns into all the other thrillers.But while Dark Places isn't as good as I hoped it to be, it's still a decent thrilling. It's what it needs to be - it's an intriguing mystery. It just isn't a thriller which would haunt you, it's not that original. It won't stay with you for too long, and you probably won't think about watching it again. You could never watch it and you wouldn't miss anything. It's good for a one watch, it's thrilling enough for that, but once you've seen it all and you know everything, what would be the point to see it again, when it doesn't offer something really extraordinary like its counterpart?"
