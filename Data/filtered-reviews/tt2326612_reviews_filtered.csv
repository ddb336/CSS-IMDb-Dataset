" Very intense
",2021-04-06 00:00:00,9,I thought it was going to be weirdly disjointed with the flashbacks but it worked. It was edge of your seat intense. I was hoping for more at the end like catching everyone else.
" Reminder why it's so risky to let one person control a film's creation
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,5,"Since this was both written and directed by the same person who has a reputation for insisting on creative control, this is mostly the result of one person's vision. And that vision is in desperate need of outside input. That's because left on its own, it's another case of ""whatever's in the filmmaker's head, did NOT migrate to the outside in order to get on the screen and into our heads.""This desperately needs to be re-edited for more clarity and continuity. I could follow the needless time-hopping well enough; that's not the problem. The problem is the holes in the plot, and the needless scenes that muddle the story. It's one thing to time-hop the story back and forth if it helps tell it. But it's another thing to time-hop scenes and plot points when it does not help, and just clutters up what could have perhaps been a good story into something mediocre.If anyone calls this movie pointless, I would not blame them one bit."
" One of the most captivating movies I've seen in a long time.
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,9,"The captive is in my POV not just another crime flick or somewhat above average thriller. It's as despicable, sickening, terrifying and intense as it can be. You see right into the abyss (aka the ominous ring in the movie) and there's no spark of light in it. Amazing story and story development including the time jumps, score, acting. On running minute 00:47 there's the quote:, ...that's what happened to her... this sentence alone was simply heartbreaking."
" Some kinda ...""ring""?
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,5,Good performances for the most part. Odd edit choices. Last emotional scene felt more like a rehersal.
" Perhaps the most disappointing movie I have ever suffered through,amazingly awful
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,1,"This movie is a nightmare, not like a thriller that is entrancing, but a sad and frustrating trap that has promise, but delivers only scattered crumbs of melodrama. It is as if someone I trusted gave me a jigsaw puzzle for Christmas. What I found in the box was a random mix of pieces from at least 10 different puzzles. They just won't ever fit together to form a coherent picture. And I wasted two hours figuring out that the joke was on me. And it sure was not fun or funny."
" An edge of your seat....time warp
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,10,"Oh my! Parents worst nightmare! To be... almost responsible for your child's 'demise'! To accept, to reconcile with the fact that perhaps you were responsible for it all! And then yet somehow, some way... persistence obliterates the barriers that keep you from discovering the truth!
This film as an eclectic work of art by Atom not mention the eccentric thespians employed to portray the various chess pieces that entwine this game to its treacherous yet victorious conclusion! The synergy and juxtaposition of the various timelines was unexpectedly devious! Bravo Atom! Talk about envisioning outside the box! Wow...just wow! My heart was in my hand, thumping away. (I am not a father yet this film brought me as close as one could get to fatherhood). One last thought, Kevin Durand, you were brilliantly sinister yet somehow morbidly empathizing...!"
" Surprisingly good!
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,7,"This is the kind of movies I never know how it will go for me. In the end, I was at the edge of my seat all along and enjoyed it a lot."
" Everything about this movie is already revealed in the first half.
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,5,"The overall plot has potential and could have been more well produced. The message is there, the acting isn't bad. But they could have made it more thrilling and suspenseful because it was dragged for way too long."
" Enos
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,7,Enos is OUTSTANDING in this. Too bad she was overlooked for award nominations.
" A powerful, gripping and haunting story.
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,9,"I thought this movie was awesome, in a sad, gripping way. I understood what was happening throughout the movie.
I don't understand why folks were confused by this movie.
Ryan Reynolds and the rest of the cast were brilliant.
Don't listen to the naysayers.
If you have any love for children and what can happen to them, it's definitely worth a watch.
It's not happy, feelgood Hollywood tripe. It's real and raw."
" Terrible
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,1,What a waste of time. Ryan Reynolds should be ashamed making this one.
" Hysterically bad movie.
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,3,"Ryan Reynolds is the only thing about this film that isn't ridiculous and inexplicable. The gimmick of jumping back and forth in the timeline is wasted on this film ... usually it serves some purpose in a movie's storytelling but in this movie it doesn't serve any purpose. It just adds unnecessary confusion on top of completely ridiculous and go-nowhere character details and pointless twists. The main villain needed to have subtitles to understand a word he said, there were featured characters who were completely pointless to the story, and there were moments of jaw-dropping implausibility. A shame because of the film it COULD have been."
" fast forwarded
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,5,"Had to move the movie along with the remote. weird subplots that never get resolved and some of the bad guys are unaccounted for and lots of questions why the characters didn't do this or that and is it past or present. if that sounds a bit jumbled and u liked it, you'll like the movie. but enough suspense to pass an hour and 52 mins if u absolutely nothing else to do."
" So disappointing
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,2,"My wife and I watch anything with Ryan Reynolds...and when we saw this one on Showtime, we had never heard of it, so we decided to watch. Bad decision.Within the first 10 minutes we were somewhat confused. We are introduced to different characters in different situations but had absolutely no idea how any of them were related. Nothing made sense....but we kept watching, believing that all would be revealed. It eventually was, but not with any satisfaction.There are so many questions after watching this movie.Why were we introduced to the detective's team, especially making such a big deal about the guy that paid close attention to details (the one that could see what a puzzle was to be before it was put together) if he wasn't going to be seen again for the rest of the film?Why did the detectives immediately treat the father like he was the only suspect? Their treatment of him was criminal.Vince Gray (Bruce Greenwood's character)...what was the point of having him in the film?The lady that came to the gala and ended up kidnapping the detective...did no one find it odd that she was able to come in and take a seat at the table with the most important people in the room? And then to escort the guest of honor out of the event and into a limo? No one questioned any of that?Why was it ALWAYS snowing? No matter where we were in the timeline, it was snowing. It's as if they only had 5 days to shoot this movie...How did the two detectives end up in a relationship? Why?If she was such an experienced and highly thought of detective that specialized in child abduction, why would she interrupt a connection between the other detective's niece and the missing girl instead of listening in for possible clues?Willy...imprisoned as a child abductor, but then when he has a visitor in prison, no one is interested in who he sees and talks to?Det Cornwall seems to always have a chip on his shoulder. Is there a reason he is so hostile towards the father?The mother...finds all of these strange things in the rooms where she cleans, but doesn't think it should be brought to the attention of the police until after she finds 4 items?The father sees and talks to his daughter, but he also doesn't tell the detectives about that until later?I get that the director wanted the kidnapper to come across as creepy, but this guy went WAY over the creepy mark. That character was the most unbelievable. And what's with that mustache?There was hardly anything in this movie that was believable. The two stars I give is for Ryan. He did a good job with what he was given. I like Rosario Dawson, but her character never proved to be a detective...she did NOTHING in this case. Nothing worked.But the real culprit was the pace. It moved SO SLOWLY. Is it really necessary for us to watch the detective go up an entire escalator? That one scene pretty much sums up the movie. Nothing exciting, then boom...it's over.And about that ending...they opened the van to find the detective, but she never moves...was she dead???Don't waste your time. You'll come out in the end more frustrated than before."
" Lynchesque
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,9,"The story is both quite forward and get more and more confusing. Reminds by the story building part a lot of David Lynch, the atmosphere is then still Atom Egoyan."
" Wrong Sequence
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,6,Why show some of the key moments early and out of sequence? They only act as spoilers for later in the film.Atmospheric enough but spoilt by the spoilers in the actual delivery of the plot.
" Confusing script
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,2,"In a time frame of 8 years, the story goes back and forth from different times in the past to the present day."
" Started good but turned into a waste of a good cast and a waste of time.
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,1,This had potential but quickly went bad. A waste of a good cast and a waste of my time. Thumbs way down and if I could give zero stars I would. Simply put this a bad movie.
" Some holes won't get filled...
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,7,But it's still a good movie! The acting was great. Ryan was exceptional. I felt his internal struggle throughout the entire movie. May I never have to experience this kind of grief.
" Underwhelming
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,6,"The fact that I give it 6/10 when there was so much wrong with it, shows how good it could have been.I have no issue with films jumping around in chronology but there seemed so little thought in many of the scenes that they were placed in the order that they were for no logical reason and could easily have been the opposite and no altered it at all.For a 110 minute film, so many of the characters and stories are under developed and then other which have no consequence bare overdone, including the main villain whose motives are not explained.It is still good and watchable but could easily have been a lot better."
" Text correction!
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,9,"In my review of this film I was, once again, the victim of the unfortunate autocorrect error that I failed to notice. In light of its possibly being misunderstood as antisemetic, I thought I'd try and write this correction:
In the second sentence it reads ""Other re Jews have gone..."", when it Should Have Read, ""Other reviewers have gone..."".
Apologies for any confusion or unintended offense."
" Overall great film with a couple of fleshing out opportunities
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,9,"I am not going to take up any time writing about the plot of the movie. Other re Jews have gone into great detail so I don't feel it's necessary.
What I will write about a couple of observations.
The acting was very well performed. I sometimes wonder if I've watched the same movie and performances as some other reviewers who saw it and rated it completely differently! I believe one even referred to Reynolds performance as ""wooden""!? Really? I thought his every word and action were entirely out of grief and guilt, and don't know how it could be viewed any other way. He was a father, destroyed!
I enjoyed the film and felt it had suspense enough for even a Hitchcock fan. While I am not a particular fan of the flashback, it has its place. This film didn't seem to benefit from its use, however, and It's possible it only confused some.
The only two complaints I have are that I did feel there could have been more work done to flesh out the connections, and fill in the gaps. When they were allowed to meet, Cassie said it wouldn't have mattered whether or not Matthew had left her alone in the truck for those few short minutes because she was being watched, and they just would have grabbed her another time. But the question remains unanswered, who are these people? How is the man arrested for trying to meet up with whom he assumed to be a young girl connected to Cassie's guard? We see them at prison visitation together, so we know there Is one, they just don't fill us in on what it is. And how are either of them connected to the woman who drugged, kidnapped, and delivered the detective to the guard?
There were a few other plot holes, but again, for me the only ones of real relevance were the connections between the bad guys.
This is a good movie, and if you don't dwell on the content of other reviews before watching it, you should enjoy it without any real problems.
This is a very current topic, and I'm glad to see it's being used to illuminate these crimes for the public at large!"
" Too much anguish
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,7,"What begins teasingly moody, however, about the ramifications of a horrible incident - shades of ""The Sweet Hereafter,"" still Egoyan's best film - becomes baroque and ludicrous as the Hitchcockian scenario, although it ends up loosing its psychological bearings in a web of too many plot twists and self-conscious jumps in time. Though Ryan Reynolds rises above the rest as a father destroyed by sadness and anger, ""The Captive"" quickly devolves into scenes feeling like stilted dramatic re-creations. All in all there is a sad atmosphere but it works pretty well, though not being a masterpiece."
" Boring
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,4,"The awkward script, slow pace, and bad acting ruined what could have been a good story."
" A waste of air time
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,1,This movie was not clearly thought through!! I'm over half way through the movie and I must've missed the reason of why she was kidnapped!! I can't even give the movie one star!!!
" If you are a parent be prepared to have nightmares after seeing it.
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,8,"Watched the movie for the first time and the first 30 minutes I felt I was watching what could be a parents nightmare.I can see folks that don't have kids or people that don't care about their kids, taking issue with the movie possibly because they just don't know any better.It does jump around a bit but it is for a purpose and the review Pgeorge11 provided is very accurate. I will be looking up more movies done by Atom Egoyan. Ryan Reynolds as the dad blows me away. Kevin Durand? What can I say? I am so glad I watched him in previous roles where he was the good guy. So glad this was not my first time seeing him play a role. It might have scarred me. Maybe. He just is that good."
" The people giving poor reviews are simply stupid.
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,9,"I noticed a trend in these reviews. The issues with this movie that some people describe, such as not knowing when a scene is taking place in the timeline, how the kidnapper would know where the father would be, why the father would follow the trail of trees, why the female kidnapping assistant would interview the male skater, are not plot holes or issues at all. Hints are placed throughout the story as to why these things happen. I really enjoyed this movie, because I love noticing small details, and thinking throughout a movie. If you were to watch events unfold in real life, not everything would be spelled out for you, but you could easily make educated assumptions, to complete the story. I believe this movie does that. It provides some instances of dramatic irony, but in certain cases, it leaves hints that are intended to lead the audience to deduce the flow of events. Negative reviews of the nature that I described, seem to only broadcast the reviewer's lack of critical thinking or intellect. This movie was brilliant. The only tragedy here, is that it received a poor rating, because so many people are too stupid to connect the dots the director painstakingly placed throughout the film. I didn't give this film a perfect rating, due to the fact that I thought more could've been done with the female detective's captivity, and a backstop as to why the male detective was so bitter towards Ryan Reynolds' character. It was mentioned multiple times in the movie that Ryan Reynolds' Character reminded the detective of someone, that seemed to be hinting at another storyline that wasn't developed. I am rating this film higher than I usually would, simply to negate at least one low review, blaming the film for the reviewer's own pathetic attention to detail, and lack of intellect."
" Solid police procedural but is sometimes unrealistic
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,5,"Spoiler Alert Spoiler Alert
At one point in the movie around the 57:02 mark, the detectives have the character Cassandra in a chat room with a young girl. At that point they could have easily traced the IP routing address back to internet provider, providing them with some clue as to where Cassandra is."
" Just.... don't!
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,4,"Good premise. But it doesn't satisfy. The story is very confusing, it moves back and forth in time without changing the characterization of the characters. It seems that no character is deepened, no story is deepened and passes from one scene to another, without meaning. It doesn't capture attention. We just want to see it all the way out of curiosity. And the girl comes back, like it's nothing. Nor do they imply that there is trauma, because there is no time for that. The story runs over and when they want to tell everything they don't explain anything. All the characters are monotonous, have no personality or interest."
" Too many plot holes
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,5,"Man, I wanted this to be good. The idea is definitely there it was just executed badly. The acting and people involved were chosen well, Ryan Reynolds especially I thought did a good job. But that's all the positives from me.There's just too many issues and plot holes in this, that you can't get past. The ""villain"" who has the daughter in captive. What's his deal? Why does he act bizarre? There's nothing explained about him at all. This is a common occurrence for a lot of the characters in this. Nobody is explained. No depth.The lack of character depth then spilt into the plot itself. Certain conversations made no sense, because we have no depth to go off. An example is the convo in the prison (not a spoiler) who is this guy who is giving out demands and acting the top dog, when this scene is literally the only sodding scene he's in. WHO IS HE? Why does he have power? This sets up the next part, but you're left wondering why!Other major issue was the flashbacks, they were not done correctly at all. Usually when it flashes back it should let us know, even if it's subtle and the characters look different. But no, it's literally the exact same just next shot. So half the time you are clueless that the scene isn't present and is past.I feel like 5 is slightly generous won't lie, but I'm in a good mood today. It's a watchable film don't get me wrong, but it has a lot of issues. It's a shame because the idea is there, just the execution isn't."
" Confusing
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,5,"Not a bad film by any means but the timeline jumps around so much without any explanation it makes it really difficult to follow,can't understand why they decided to cut it this way,odd decision"
" Very Mediocre
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,5,"I really don't understand what the purpose of this film was. There was no well-defined or underlying message, there was nothing substantial between any of the events or relationships between the lead cast. Characters came into the plot and then left with no explanation or relevance.
I have so many more questions than answers.The overall story was not terrible, but the lack of depth in this film was unable hold the weight of the poorly executed, non-linear plot.
In the end, the acting was the only solid foundation here.I have the overall impression this was made to be a somewhat family-friendly movie for a dark subject in lieu of an after-school-special."
" Why the jumping timeline?
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,5,It's an interesting film with many good character studies but so confusing because of its jumping all over the place timeline. Very difficult to keep track of what's going on.
" Good watch
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,7,"I thought this movie was a really good watch. I liked the non linear timeline, and the intruige it created, and I do like to see Ryan Reynolds on his more serious roles. I was gripped and needed to know the ending so I give it a solid 7. It wasn't ""egde of my seat"" gripping but none the less. I would recommend"
" This movie was horrible
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,2,The only reason this movie got 2 stars was for Ryan Reynolds 🙄 It didn't make much since!
" Compelling thriller
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,8,I found this movie very engaging and it kept me interested mostly because of Ryan Reynolds performance. The other actors are also good but it is really Reynolds movie.It is difficult to follow because it flips in and out of different time frames and there's no technique to let you know when they are in the past and when they are in the present. In most cases it is fairly obvious because they show the kidnapped daughter when she was young and then when she is a teenager. But sometimes it's really not clear at all and it gets confusing --perhaps if the director had shown those scenes in black-and-white or dimmed the color or used some technique to let us know they were going back and forth.At one point Scott Speedman who plays the detective uses his niece as bait. That was very strange since we never really meet her until that particular scene and we never meet the detective's brother who apparently authorized it. But a well-developed suspenseful story.
" Woooooaw!
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,10,"This is SO darned good. Once again the mouthbreathers stun with their obtusity. Don't read the bad reviews. This film is so astonishingly good.
Every actor in it seems hand-picked for their role, each one's performance is spot on, some of the performances shine like diamonds. Of *course* these are such talented actors, and of *course* it is the mark of the brilliant direction of Atom Egoyan.
We've seen these actors in many different performances. I have never seen performances like they give in this film.
I would watch Kevin Durand in anything, I think he is that good. He's always a lot of fun to watch, and he's just.so.good in this role. Amazing. I've become a fan of Ryan Reynolds lately, and was struck again by his depth as a performer. Mireille Enos?! I've seen her in a couple of things, and was blown away by a talent I didn't realize she had. (My bad!) Bruce Greenwood is always great :) Really, each one in this film is perfect in their role.
I seem to have been watching a lot of things lately that were filmed in Canadian winter settings. I've been lucky that they've all been good movies. When it's used right, the space and beauty of Canada in wintertime have so much to contribute to the mood of a film.
As I watched, rather than be irritated by jumps in time, as so many viewers seem to be, I was so invested in the story and the characters, that I welcomed each scene as an opportunity to learn more and to share (as much as one can as a passive viewer) in the events, and to share in just the experience of watching. So thanks again to Atom Egoyan, for a masterful turn."
" Not the movie I expected
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,8,"Definitely not a movie for casual viewing. All the characters are very grounded, and relatable. The winter setting gives a hopeless feeling to all the scenes. Time jumps give a feeling of discombobulated, that put you in a similar state of mind to the main character. The movie doesn't hold your hand through the plot, and you've got to figure out the chess moves being made (I had to think about Cass' clue for a bit after). Reynolds was greatHad a few issues. time jumps weren't obvious. other than some minor changes to hairstyles everything stayed the same? it would have been nice to make them a bit more obvious (change the season or put more wear and tear on Matt's truck). Niagara doesn't get that snowy (filmed mostly in Sudbury), but whatever. Main villain was too mustache twirling, his only characteristic was evil pedophile. Superstar police team was introduced then never heard from again"
" Slow, irrational, unrealistic drama rather than thriller
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,5,"Even a drama has a couple of thrills and I would not define this a thriller, but rather a non well time lined slow drama with some quick fast forwards which miss the potential result.Also, am I and my friend the only ones who did not get the timing of the kidnapping of the female detective?
How can she be kidnapped after going on a charity dinner and then keep working in the case the minute after? Then, minutes later she is found by a squat police team? Come again?
For a moment I thought that it happened before the finding of the girl, then went on, but NO, when they find the girl, she says to the male detective that they will find his girlfriend...what? May be I got something wrong, but I read more folks found the timing non sense.The misbehavior of the police is not justified by any background information. Out of place or if it is in place, We all did not get it, so badly conveyed. Pity."
" Not worth it
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,3,"I want the last 2 hours of my life back. Why were there so many high-profile actors in this piece of junk? It would've been better if it had gone full tilt crazy, but it just went up to the edge and slithered backwards again."
" A bit messy but intriguing and enjoyable
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,7,"The movie can be a little jarring in spots, as it constantly flips between 3 or 4 different time periods that the same story is taking place without any warning. However, I found myself on the literal edge of my seat through some scenes, which doesn't happen often. The way the story all eventually comes together is quite clever. I was never bored.I wonder however, if the story had been portrayed through a linear format, would it have made a difference? I just felt like all the time jumping was unnecessary to the plot, and was more of a distraction. Speaking of, there were a few minor plot holes, like how the girl was taken in a matter of two minutes in broad daylight without being seen by anyone or leaving any tyre tracks in the snow? Or how the detectives treated Ryan Reynold's character (the father). I get they have to investigate all possible suspects but I just can't imagine a real investigation being handled the way that they did in the movie in regards to the father.But aside from a few minor issues like that, overall it was quite an enjoyable film with a satisfying conclusion, and had high tension with gripping moments. Pretty good thriller."
" So much potential
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,5,"Good potential, bad presentation. The plot was good but it got boring with many pointless points and slow pace.
The police sucked. They couldn't find anything for 8 years and even the detective was captured? Really?
The back and forth with the years got me tired. Ok to do it for some circumstances but not all the way through.
What was the point of the father stealing their phone? He had already pined his phone on their car.
How did the detective found Kas and put his niece talk to her?
Many things were pointless and nonsense.
If the police wanted to find Nicole and the abduction network why kill them both? I don't get it.
Well. Overall bad."
" A captivating movie
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,8,"Great watch, will probably watch again, but can't recommend to everyone as it has a rather serious tone and triggers abound.I turned this in thinking it was going Tobe the worst Ryan Reynolds movie where he's in a casket (Buried), but this is a masterful story of child abduction.Ryan Reynolds and Mirielle Enos show off a full range of emotions as concerned parents, and Rosario Dawson and Kevin Durand give is beautiful sociopath performances.The snowy setting gives it all a wonderful flavor to this story of loss and isolation.If you can handle the subject matter, then give this a watch."
" Bad
",2020-03-13 00:00:00,3,"It's hard to count the ways this movie sucks. First of all let me just say that except for Rosario Dawson, who didn't sell her roll as a lead detective, the acting was superb. Ryan Reynolds killed it when it came to portraying a grief stricken father. The other actors were very good too. The biggest problem with this film was the logic and believability of the plot. Apparently, even the writer and director did not even understand the motives behind the bad guy's actions. And their actions are outrageously bizarre and confusing. And not in an entertaining way. I am not going to try to sneak in a spoiler here but let's just say that at the end of this flick, you'll feel as if you wasted your time. Watch it if you must but don't say no one warned you ;)"
" The terrible reviews are disappointing.
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie was not the best movie I have ever seen, but it was a pretty good thriller! I love Ryan Reynolds' acting in this film. He acts the exact same way I would act if I were in the same situation. This is a very believable story and is quite easy to follow along. I would actually give it an 8, but I am rating it higher to raise the average. I don't think people know a good movie when they see it anymore."
" I never leave reviews. But holy hell this is movie is bad.
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,2,Complete nonsense from about 20 minutes in... The acting is just... And the plot is just ... And the ending wtf is just...I mean this is an absolutely awful movie.
" The director kidnapped me for 2h...
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,1,The synopsis has potential. But it was tooootally destroyed by the script and realization. No logic. We jump from time to time like back to the future.So disappointed of the acting except Ryan. The mother is like the worst. The detective is also not very good and is good in her dress.I'm done with this comment and this movie.I do not recommend.
" Frustrating
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,3,This movie frustrates me to the core it has so much potential! I don't know why it has high ratings here. The last half was wtf. I put other stars because I enjoyed Ryan Reynolds performance.
" SLOW.....
",2020-02-06 00:00:00,7,"Not as bad as some previous reviews, just found it a tad slow. Also, I am not a fan of time jumping back and forth though it seems to be the norm these days. Ryan Reynolds is always great."
" Just barely shy of excellent.
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,8,"This was the first movie I've watched (at home) in ages where I wasn't distracted by other things (my phone, mainly) the whole time.I found it captivating (word use intentional). Casting, writing, and shooting were great. I may not find the entire film and ending to be the best plot ever, but it was very well done.8/10 would recommend. Bonus points for a true north winter 👍🏻🇨🇦👏🏻."
" Bad reviewers may just be bad at watching movies
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,7,"I don't know why people write reviews that clearly show it is their lack of intelligence that made the movie experience bad for them lol This movie is entertaining. Yes it has flashbacks, but it's not hard to decipher which timeline is which. As for the ""confusing"" plot points ... they are explained, if you actually listen to dialogue and pay attention. It's not amazing, but enjoyable to watch and an interesting little thriller."
" Stop unnecessary time-jumping in ruins movies...
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,5,"I would rate the movie as is as only a 5.
If there was no time-line jumping, the story would be way better and i would have rated a 7.
The time-line jumping adds nothing to the movie at all."
" Be your own critic
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,7,"Every time I watch a movie I go on the IMDb app to see what viewers rated the film. Y'all gave this movie such horrible ratings but I thought it was pretty good. Acting was good, wish there was more action though."
" Interesting but disjointed
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,4,It is a very interesting premise and very well acted. But the story itself is disjointed and at times you were left in a state of disbelief that people would act in the manner that they do. Which should have been a simple more gripping story turns out to be something a lot different. The movie suffers from being a little too convenient.
" I love Ryan Reynolds
",2019-12-12 00:00:00,7,"Hate he got sucked into this piece of crap. He should have read the entire script. Must have let this one slide him by. Happens to the best of us. He's a talented actor and should fire his agent for this one. Most Mississippi Grind. That is a good flick.Wait, there is something interesting going on in a limo.let's see if this sparks up. Come on Ryan. You can do it!"
" Surprisingly captivating
",2019-12-01 00:00:00,7,"It starts out just one of those extremely confusing movies. Hard to catch on. But you find yourself saying ""this is weird, I don't get it"" and yet you are sucked in. Pretty good!"
" Distressing
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,7,"A successful film with a remarkable cast. Well defined characters and solid history. However everyone has something obscure in their past that is never revealed but remains in the air as to create a support for tension. And this is perhaps the highest moment in the film, where basically the stories do not count but the atmosphere of anguish that brings hope long unfulfilled, the intuition without knowing, the loneliness of pain."
" Can I get the two hours of my life bad?
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,2,"This time jumping, muddled, hot mess was hard to follow and The acting was ridiculously subpar. The basic plot, if implemented by someone that knew what they were doing, might have worked."
" Interesting child abuse/kidnapping thriller that could have been better
",2019-09-30 00:00:00,7,"Interesting thriller by writer-director Egoyan, about a girl who is kidnapped as a child and then resurfaces on the internet 8 years later. The sex crimes police and her father get involved in trying to find her, with plenty of conflict going on among the good guys. This might have been better with some more interesting acting - there are some big names here, but the performances are kind of flat, and the bad guy does not seem dangerous enough."
" Super bummed!
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,3,This movie had a TON of potential! It was slow at first and picked up mid to the end... but then it just kind of ended!
" What was he thinking... 2
",2019-09-24 00:00:00,1,"I came to write my thoughts but someone beat me to it with the review title ""what was he thinking?""Honestly word for word I could have written the same. The director took some great actors (Ryan Reynolds is perfection,) a great story, and as it seems a good budget... But he flushed it all down the toilet.Time lapses that confused you to the point you couldn't get into it.
Pathetic waste of time scenes that added nothing.
Actors that mumble so much you need subtitles....And no ending. Boom the girl is rescued, the police woman isn't, that's a wrap let's go home.Did he get bored? Was he so confused himself that he couldn't be bothered any more?Please, Hollywood, drop this cretin."
" Smart thriller at times but in poor taste at others
",2019-09-07 00:00:00,4,"Some things should be left out of movies. Movies should not depict some things for entertainment, even if it is meant to be disturbing. Its still meant to be entertaining. Pedophiles should not be depicted or talked about as much as this movie does. Some of the dialogue about it, even though spoken by cops doing their jobs, is so revolting. I know pedophiles exist and disturbing things like this movie happen, but it should be left out of fictional movies. Mostly in poor taste"
" Great idea, but terrible.
",2019-09-06 00:00:00,4,"I thought this movie had such great potential & who doesn't love Ryan Reynolds?? but oh my goodness did it fall SHORT! it was not good at all, hard to follow along because the timeline hopped everywhere & was just too drawn out. disappointing, but true."
" Should have been an 8
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,3,"This movie starts out as a fine mystery, has great scenery, and a super talented cast.But at the end, before the credits started rolling, I said to my husband ""ugh, this better not be the end...""I guess the joke is on us that there IS no twist? It just suddenly ends and has all kinds of ridiculous red herrings.It could have been a dream, or one of the parents been involved and the ""bad guys"" were really ""good guys"", or it wasn't really their daughter, or Bruce Greenwood was behind it all? Heck, I thought the male skater might be involved somehow, like he was the woman in the disguise at the fancy event.And it isn't even a good ending as a straight-forward one.Just a great cast in a movie that completely fizzles out."
" Major Un-Believability!
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,3,"In 6th grade my teacher said: when writing a story whether Sci-Fi or Romance...make it believable! Well Atom I think you should have listened to your 6th grade teachers. Many of the other reviews bring up these inconsistancies...the ridiculous treatment of the father, Mom goes from loving to loathing, no other police-people in the building??, Dad doesn't seek help from other agencies, and to top it all off the production just runs out of money and catches the bad guys with no follow-up or explanation. And I'm sorry but the tree 'bread-crumbs' was just silly.. Dad should have gone to the police. And Mom why didn't you get suspicious at the little 'gifts' left for you at work?? Why didn't you go to the police...ever hear of fingerprints or trace evidence? Oh, boy...just too much to go on and on. Scenery was lovely if never changing... snow for 8 years...beautifully filmed but you just can't have the audience constantly saying ""Oh, Come ON""."
" Be sober, be vigilant, in this movie and in reality.
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,6,"This is an odd movie which creates a sickening but truthful reality of what may go on with certain rings who groom young children via the internet. The story creates more questions than one would really want to ask, and certainly broadens the mind to the unfortunate goings on in this wicked world.Regarding the movie itself, the scenes of the story are not stitched together in chronological order. There are scenes which the story tells in the past and your mind is set on that timeline, then the story skips six to eight years into the future without warning. Then just when your mind has set on that timeline, the story veers off back into the past then the future, and back again into the past, and it is hard to keep up in certain areas what part of the timeline you are watching.There was no real explanation as to why the girl got kidnapped, what the kidnappers were doing with the girl.There is a character within the movie who has a gift of 'attention to detail' and works with the police to help them solves cases, however after you see his gift in action, he is never shown again throughout the movie, which begs the question.. why build the character up and not use him further?The acting is very good, and full marks out of ten for each character. Both Ryan Reynolds and Scott Speedman play convincing characters.The movie in general is something that you cannot just watch and switch off, you have to be alert and focused throughout to understand what is going on at all times. Perhaps it's a way to show the audience that in this world we ought to remain focused as to what actually goes on around us.1 Peter 5:8 - The Bible.
'Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:'"
" One of the worst movies ever seen
",2019-07-18 00:00:00,1,When I saw 5.9 rating in IMDB I wanted to ignore but still gave a go for it. In the beginning I was wondering why movie has such low rating as it was very nicely shot and well performed by Ryan Gosling. But as it's progressed most of it doesn't make any sense. Very bad ending as no clue why Vicky interviewed Albert about trophy which lead to thier location. And if Ryan has already planted his phone in Vicky's car what the point of him talking to them and what's the point of that chase scene. And how they found nickole no idea.I don't recommend it to anyone.
" Terrible
",2019-05-31 00:00:00,2,"I am ashamed to say I watched it , much less wrote it or started in it. Why was this movie ever made? Made next to no sense and practically laughable. Unless you are just twiddling your thumbs and staring off into space, don't bother."
" Very low sound
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,4,I couldn't hear the movie it was so low. I had to turn my volume up to 60 when I usually can hear a show at 20.
" What kind of ended was that????
",2019-05-15 00:00:00,5,"Was the girl brainwashed at the end and still working for them?? Did the cop who was shot DIE in the end? Do they find the female cop? Was the dad really in on it up to a point? And what was the bit about the GIMMICK???? So many unanswered questions! Jeez! It was a great movie until the last 15 minutes! I give 10 points for the great plot, the thrills, the actors. But I SUBTRACT 5 for the potholes never resolved and the LOUSY ENDING!!!"
" Waste Of Time.
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,2,"Well first time writing a review but here goes, I can only agree with some comments, good acting with out a doubt but the plot was all over the place, mixing it up with past and then present situations pointless, music score being played desperately I felt over certain scenes in a desperate way of excitement, Over 4 years watching the parents really !! And the raid at the end ""Oh I've seen the kidnappers come get them"" Ok and why take the woman's phone if you wanted to track them. So many things I could highlight Sorry if of track. !!!!"
" Better than most reviews suggest...
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,7,"I thought it was a very good movie.
Not Great, but very good.It was a little longer than it needed to be, and the flashbacks were a little confusing to begin with...but once you figured out the time line, I thought it was a good story. A few things I may have done differently, but....Worth watching for sure.Ryan Reynolds performance was top notch. One of those movies that went under the radar, but really shows the dramatic actor he can be. Really believable character..."
" Not a thriller
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,3,"The subtle hints of another watcher, the going back and forth in time, I expected the ending to have some sort of twist, so we understand why all these were necessary, but there was none. I went back to read the reviews to see maybe I missed something, but I didn't it's just a very simple plot that we've seen a million time with a very unnecessary and complicated editing."
" Stunning cast, great subject, horrible Direction!
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,4,"The cast was great. They portrayed a realistic scenario true to form. The Direction and scattered nature of the way the presented the movie was horrid. I spent over a decade working child crimes as an officer. While they captured the fragmented nature of what it does to lives, they fragmented everything in the movie making it hard to follow and leaving you feel disjointed!"
" Great movie !
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,9,"I liked it very much and wasn't bored at all. Very good method acting showing despare by Ryan Reynolds and his wife. It was a very captivating thriller with more than enough action and fortunately once without limp unnecessary violence. The bad guys and woman acted very creepy, were perverted, calculating and terrifying.
Further it had an easy enough to follow well constructed storyline.
So where does that weird low rating come from ?"
" Very good and something different for a change
",2019-03-19 00:00:00,10,"I was intrigued by the story, the fragments that were mixed up and the bad guy motive was one that we havent seen before: quite entertaining and well acted! Also great that it had different genres combined without exaggerating."
" Disjointed but good
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,7,"You have to REALLY watch this closely otherwise you'll lose the plot but it's worth it.
Not the best movie ever made but not the worst. Delicate subject handled well."
" Not bad at all.
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,8,"I think this movie confused a lot of viewers because of the unusual plot and somewhat disjointed chronology of events. The acting wasn't bad. Reynolds was especially good. It's not a movie that will please everyone, that's for sure, but I like unusual movies that attempt to be different anyway, so... there's that."
" Ugh...
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,1,"The acting jn this movie was great. And why wouldn't it be with great actors? But, that's IT! The pacing is bad, the storyline is weak, the chronology is confusing, there is NO climax and the resolution is completely lackluster and unimaginative. I LOVE Ryan Reynolds, but this movie sucks. Find out for yourself if you have some time to waste."
" Unsatisfying
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,5,"Hmm. This film wasn't bad, but it was a little slow paced on one hand and slightly hard to keep up with the flash back and forths on the other. I did not feel satisfied by how it was all wrapped up and ended."
" Bit of a waste
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,5,"It's such a shame that this film didn't quite live up to its potential. It could have been so much better than it was. Don't get me wrong, its certainly watchable, but it fell a bit flat. The timeline is a bit all over the place, the male detective is horrible and it makes no sense why she would be allowed to contact her father 8 years after being abducted. The end product was a waste of good acting abilities."
" Boring and uncomfortable
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,2,"The two stars are for Ryan Renolds. That's it.First off, that male cop needed his teeth pulled out one by one. You don't treat a parent of a missing kid like that, even if you suspect them. And if you do suspect them, and it's them, you already caught the guy. So stop. Try to find other alternatives cause you have a short time period with child abductions.
Also you don't grab a woman like that, let alone your boss.Secondly, I barely made it through the beginning of this movie. It's uncomfortable and slow...boring...and nothing connects. I couldn't tell what was in the past or present and who was who.Who made this? Seriously. Like what psychopath made this? Waste of Ryan Reynolds."
" spoilers maybe
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,4,"At one point Atom Egoyan went mainstream usa and it just killed his soul. This movie has beautyful actors, great scenery and a happy ending. It still has some of his favourite themes and filming sequences but it lacks his soul, maybe there is a different ending, probably not approved for and so he edited it with total indifference, or maybe this was just a fat paycheck and he had a good time filming it, made the best of it while doing it and then forgot about the public, at his age these things happen, sometimes you're just bored and disappointed and you stop caring because the money and power people are just a bunch of addicts that are not worth your while,
i was disappointed and gave it a 4, but i still recognized his signature and well
for me he is up there with nicolas roegg, wim wenders and rainer fassbinder, well if up there means anything to anyone but me.
are"
" Slow..dull ..boring!
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,1,The movie does not a promising not but its pace its biggest letdown. The story does not unfold fast enough to keep the viewers engaged.
" Possibly one of the worst movies ever made
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,1,Dont waste your time watching this movie. Would rate it 1/10 again if I could
" Would have been 7 if the time frame wasn't sh**
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,6,I was expecting the worst because of the reviews but it was actually really good and with a really good ending that I wasn't expecting but the time frame was jumping all over the sodding shop it was so hard to keep track. Like if look I away for 2 minutes then it's 8 years ago then I look away again and would you believe it we're in the present like come on man.
" Surprised by the bad reviews
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,10,"It is gripping and every bit a thriller...
Am surprised why the critics didn't like it. . Maybe if u r happily married and have a daughter.. u may fall for it"
" A Tense but enjoyable thriller👌
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,7,"Always a hard subject to approach, but I thought this movie handled it very well! I was certainly drawn to the characters and Kevin Durand was excellent as the bad guy(even his singing was creepy)! I would certainly recommend this movie although not as a pick me up!!"
" Just bad
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,3,"The actors were great but either something was lost on the cutting room floor or the story was just bad from the start. Too much drawn out, slow panning around or zooming in for no reason. In one of the first scenes, the mom walks into a cafe and sits down to talk to the cop. The camera rests on the mom's sunglassed face seemingly forever, but at that point, we don't know who she is! Why are we looking at this random woman doing nothing? I almost stopped the movie there and I should've.
Too many disjointed flashbacks with no time reference. Really bad direction, editing, or production. Nothing the cast could've done to save it."
" Very good psychological thriller
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,7,"I can't understand some of the awful reviews that some fellow buffs have written on this film. I've watched it twice now and found it exciting and well acted by a strong cast.The storyline is intriguing and there are plenty of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat (unless you watch it standing up, which seems a bit pointless) until the dramatic conclusion. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
" DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME
",2018-12-19 00:00:00,1,Please don't waste your time it's very slow and it's absolutely rubbish
" Unbelievably painful to watch
",2018-12-11 00:00:00,1,This is the kind of film you get when some priviledged noob with an extra couple mil lying around is convinced he can be a film director......because he can; but really he cant
" Research is Crucial!
",2018-12-08 00:00:00,2,"As a writer, 85% is research when writing about REAL life. It's a pity the writers insulted the agents who spend their lives finding stolen children. And this movie has made a mockery of this very serious issue for the sake of box office revenues."
" Worst movie ever
",2018-11-29 00:00:00,1,"Just like some other reviewers, I created this account today to review this movie.It's just that terrible. Plotline is rubbish, the pedo character came straight out of a cartoon, nothing makes any sense, it's a complete waste of an acceptable cast, waste of money, waste of time.I don't have anything positive to say about this movie. The fact that some people gave it a positive review is a real enigma to me, I really doubt those reviews are genuine.Toss it. There will be no regrets."
" Horrible
",2018-11-29 00:00:00,2,"Horrible writing, horrible acting. Plot holes. The movie is a waste of breath. I would rather pull out my fingernails."
" I did not like this movie.
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,1,"The story was weird, and the timeline was all over the place. I didn't know if i was in a flashback of the past or the present half the time."
" Could Have Been
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,5,I wanted to like this movie but I had a hard time staying with the plot. Not because I could not stick with it but because it was so choppy. No real flow to the storyline and the acting was mediocre.
" Where's Batman??
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,8,"Okay, I'm actually enjoying this, but in a way as if Batmen & Robin were going to eventually show up to save the day based on the main vilan in all of this, and his cohurts.I mean, yes, it's heartbreaking from a parents standpoint, but that's about it because there's no way top pedophile cops would be this stupid, and pedophiles so obvious unless they're in a Batman flick.
Nevertheless, entertaining."
" Underrated
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,8,"Absolutely underrated,deserved much and much better."
" a very different take on a kidnapping
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,9,"Review: I didn't really like this movie because it exploits every parents fear which is your child being kidnapped. The direction and screenplay are really chilling. I doubt any other director could handle this child kidnapping/exploitation concept so a hat's off to Atom Egoyan for taking a shot in the dark of every parents fear and pulling out this rather twisted masterpiece. The casting and acting are incredible, especially by Ryan Reynolds, Mireille Enos, Scott Speedman and Rosario Dawson. Ryan Reynolds and Mireille Enos give heart wrenching performances as the perents in this horrible situation. Scott Speedman and Rosario Dawson give slick performances as the police tasked with finding the missing child. All in all I would give this four out of a possible five stars."
" Fair to middling.
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,6,"Not to bad, plot a bit silly. Ryan Reynolds took this role very seriously. A movie quite similar to PRISONERS. Not as good as that movie though. Maybe ended quite quickly, maybe could have put in a bit more into a more realistic ending. Seemed slow and overlong. Rosario Dawson was the reason I watched. Not a bad film but not great either. Middle of the road. Kevin Durand played a creepy abductor."
" A Great Film, AND Canadian!
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,8,"A slow burner, but a good experience. A different kind of mystery film, with great acting/characters. Music sometimes reminded of Bernard Hermann with the dramatic tension, but it still works. Not a fan of the song at the ending credits, but then the movie (film) is over anyway.Worth watching as it slowly draws you in. Some may argue that the ending is 'oh so joyous and emotional', but as a viewer, I needed and was rooting for that type of ending.A couple of details I was confused about, so maybe I have to watch the start again to catch them - which is, by the way, a sign of a great film, because is makes for great discussions."
" It's not James Bond
",2018-09-20 00:00:00,5,It has the look and feel of a James Bond movie without 007 but too many non sequitors and holes in the narrative.
" The most convenient thriller you'll ever see
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,1,The best part about this movie is the big ass mirror conveniently placed in front of the captor so that we could see his expression while watching a screen.And when I say the best I mean the worst. My advice is: only watch this movie if you're in the mood for a comedy. Because there's no other way to watch this movie other than to laugh at it.
" Pretty Bad
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,4,"Ryan Reynolds and Peyton Kennedy are great actors but the script and funky flashbacks flash fowards with no clue as to where you were was frustrating. There were holes in the story and plot, and things you thought were foreshadowing but went nowhere. I was so disappointed since I like all the actors in this movie and was expecting something better. I didn't read these reviews first. The story itself is hard to watch, like any where children abductions are the subject. There is a lesson to be learned for all parents, but beyond that, not worth the time."
" Good story wrapped around a confusing structure
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,7,"The story itself is interesting and Ryan Reynolds provides a great performance as the father of the missing child. What is confusing is the structure of the movie. It involves flashbacks over the course of eight years without any obvious transition. As the entire movie is filmed in the winter and with minimal differences in the appearance of the characters, these erratic transitions make the movie frustrating at times to follow."
" Bad
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,4,"This movie had such good premise, but it was just awful. The directing was bad, the writing was bad, the plot lines were bad. No one seemed to want to tell each anything that was happening or do anything about anything. Just overall bad, and not relatable at all. Love Ryan and Rosario, but this just stunk."
" Waste of time!
",2018-09-07 00:00:00,2,The subject is very good. But this movie is a disaster of directory! The director should start selling groceries instead of wasting valuable sources to make super bad movies!!! Shame on you!!!
" Good movie but a little frustrating.
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,7,"I loved the movie and the plot but one thing that I found annoying during the movie was how the wife(Tina Lane) turned on her husband(Matthew Lane) and even made it seem like she thought he was involved in Cass' disappearance. Then at the end, when Cass is found and it was proven Matthew had nothing to do with it, she does not even apologize for her idiotic blaming and accusing of her husband and her husband seems just fine with it. I'd have kicked that wicked woman to the curb. Other than that...great movie, great plot and had a happy ending."
" Good movie...fast ending
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,8,Good movie but it lacked a climactic ending. The ending came and went so quickly that it just seen to be missing something. Overall good movie I gave an 8
" Would have given it an 8 if not for the last 5 minutes, but still quite good
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,7,"I would have given it an 8 except for the very last two scenes. Cas is reunited with her family and all is right with the world, as per the movie. It does not work that way in real life. The portrayal of Cas's Mom and Dad by Enos and Reynolds was subtly-written and subtly-acted. It had such complexity that it was both refreshing, heart-breaking, and just downright depressing. And it seemed so much more honest than so many movies. So, to see the movie end in such a cliche Hollywood way, indicating that everything is now going to be just hunky-dorey, nearly spoiled the movie for me. Still, I gave it a 7 for what I saw before the last 5 minutes. (A couple of the scenes with Reynolds was worthy of a 9.)"
" Ryan Renolds is the only thing that gets 3 stars lol
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,3,This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Whoever wrote this trash should have their kids taken from them!
" A Solid 8.
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,8,"If you are kind of dumb and have a hard time following on stories with multiple timelines happening in parallel, read the 0s and 1s reviews here because you belong to that group. Now if you want to see a good movie without listening to reviews that come from sub-human brains, go ahead and watch it, because THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE."
" Don't listen to the bad reviews. Great, well made movie.
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,10,Such a well made movie. Had me from the beginning to end. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews. Not sure what the ney sayers were talking about.
" Great movie!
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,9,"The storyline and characterization was deep and relatable. Good acting & cinematography. I'm not typically into Mysteries, but this was a really great movie! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Definitely worth watching."
" It could have been so much more...
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,6,"With all that's already been said about this movie let me just underline that it's an okay film, but the subplots could have been taken so much further, and make it into a great, albeit dark, film. A greater in-depth look at the actual ring, and the target audience of these so-called stories; a little background story into the other girl; perhaps even Dawson's character; why Reynolds rubs the male cop the wrong way(it was never fully explained), and so on..."
" Good plot gets let down
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,4,"The basic plot is good and the acting and actors are also good. However, the film gets let down in other areas. The film is very disjointed. It jumps between past and present with no obvious divisions so you can readily work out where you are in the timeline. This becomes very frustrating. The story has many holes in it which you expect to be filled but they never are. This again leaves you very frustrated. Overall it feels like half of the movie was never made."
" If you're reading this you're not a captive and you don't have to watch this awful film.
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,1,"Before I eviscerate this giant bag of dumb, it's worth pointing out that Ryan Reynolds, Rosario Dawson, and Scott Speedman, give really good performances. Mireille Enos plays the same catatonic depressive that she plays in everything else. Actually, not worth the time to take this mess apart. They already got 1:50 of my time. That's more than they deserved. Cliff notes screed: stupid storyline, pointless chronologic leap frogging in time, TERRIBLE screenplay. Don't. Just don't."
" So very bad.
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,2,The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that Ryan Reynolds and Rosario Dawson are in it. I was so confused for the first thirty minutes I had no idea what was going on. The timeline was so disconnected and the things the kidnapper did made no real sense. And why does the female kidnapper look exactly like the wife? At least dye her hair brown or something.
" The absurdly non linear approach adds nothing
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,3,The director is just showing off his gimmicky chops. Often the story fades into the background as he shoves his un ordered disordered down our throats. It's almost insulting and doesn't add anything to the story. You will spend the entire movie stopping it and explaining in to your wife or girlfriend scene by scene.
" Ryan Reynolds, why?!
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,2,"Why Ryan Reynolds would be in such a horrible plotted movie is beyond me. Horrible plot, horrible actors and horrible acting. The girl that plays the daughter is so unlikeable, makes you wish she would never be found, as well as Rosario Dawson's character.... would be better is everyone died in the end. just awful"
" Good performance but left unsatisfied
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,7,"This film emphasizes the promise Matt's daughter makes with the boy she skates with before being kidnapped in the scene where she comes in contact with her father for the first time again by asking ""was the promise kept?"". We also see the boy grown up ice skating in at least 3-4 different occasions, and by the end of the movie I do not see him meet the girl. All i see is her skating alone again for the first time. This was pretty unsatisfying. 
Ryan reynold's performance was great, which made me sympathize even more with him when every other character seemed to hate him without any evidence. The mother was the character I least sympathized with because she acted like she was the only victim, putting all the blame the father who was grieving just as much as her, but also at the same time had to deal with her b**ching, and the police assuming he sold his daughter. It was very satisfying to see the father be the one to find the kidnapper, which brings me to another set of characters I couldn't synpathize with what so ever, the investigators. If this is how the real police deal with situations like this, you wonder why there is ""never a happy ending"" as said by the the female investigator in her seech. The first the they do after someone reports a kidnapping is waste precious time accusing the person who reported it. Its not like the father is gonna go anywhere, you can always suspiciously accuse him of the crime later, why dont you instead prioritize finding a potential kidnapper while the act committed is still recent and easier to follow up. And even worse the excuse for it is that the father reminded the male investigator ""of someone ge knew"". Jesus they didn't even go further into explaining that as if it was enough of a reason. Maybe give a backstory or something. Instead I have to watch a poor father get accused of sh*t by a police force that isn't bothering to do anything until they make him feel guilty, which is already being done full time by his annoying wife who calls his attempts at finding his daughter ""idiotic"" when hes the only one trying to do anything, and even ends up being the one to find her in the end. Even worse, the only damn time they do end up finding some sort of clue, the hidden cameras, instead of trying to using it in any way to aid starting to find his daughter, they immediately go to the father's house and start accusing him of spying on his own wife for absolutely no damn reason. And his wife is on their side! In the end, he is the one who ends up catching the guy, and the wife just acts like this never happened and hugs him with their daughter. I get that the man made a mistake, but don't qct like hes the one who committed the damn crime. Ryan renyolds 10/10, 'protagonist' characters doing nothing but making Father's job harder for him -3/10, no offense the actors who played them very well. Also the really weirdly placed flashbacks were probably not a good idea, but I was able to make sense of them easily; I just feel they served no purpose."
" I can't believe I manged to sit through all of this
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,2,"A drawn out story with a rushed ending with implausible, but somehow boring twists. The movie time jumps for seemingly no reason making the scenes unnecessarily confusing. The characters are where I took the biggest issue, between characters that are unnecessary to the movie (the figure skating boy, woman partner in crime, anyone related to the kidnappers never revealed, but somehow expected of us to know) and some of the MOST cardboard acting I have ever seen from the kidnapped girl. It's a wonder I sat through this movie. It's a wonder this movie got the green light."
" Ryan Reynolds is good, everything else is bad
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,10,"I was pleasantly surprised with Ryan's acting ability here, he looked really emotional and for a comedic actor this is by far the best transition job ive seen for a drama role. Speedman was okay. Dawson is ugly as ever and still cannot act. Evertyhting about this abduction was the most ridiculous thing ive ever seen. Shes basically free to leave whenever but shes afraid they'll kill her father so she stays with the abductor the rest of her life AHAHAHAHAHA. Oh and whats really unbelievable is how someone as tall and good looking as Reynolds would be married to someone as ugly as his wife in this movie. This was definatly so bad its good"
" Misses the mark.
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,4,"Had potential but disjointed, poorly directed, with a rushed ending. Actors are fine; writer and director lost focus and pacing. As an aside, I despised the way Ryan Reynolds' character was treated by wife and detective; made zero sense."
" Goof
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,10,"I noticed another goof when it comes to the exhaust placement. In one shot, the tailpipe is shown in front of the right rear wheel and in another scene, it is behind the tire."
" Stereotypical But Pretty Good
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,8,"Slight spoilers ahead. First off, I am giving this movie an 8 for the simple reason that it ends with the good guys winning. I am SO sick of downer films where the good guys lose (die) and the bad guys triumph (there's your first slight spoiler). My first complaint is the few unanswered questions about the plot...like how did they find Nicole in that van, how did that incarcerated pedophile know the bad guy on a first name basis, and how did the bad guys plant all those hidden cameras. But my major complaint is the stereotypical characters.The father who is suspected of his daughter's abduction, but never gives up hope of finding her.The mousy mother who blames her husband for her daughter's disappearance.The daughter who appears to be suffering from Stockholm Syndrome.The female detective who's on a mission because she lived the experience as a teen.The former homicide detective who goes after suspects without gloves on, holding back no punches. He enjoys this new job because 'I get to deal with living victims'.And finally, and most obvious, the bad guys who resemble comic book characters (Snidely Whiplash and Morticia Addams come to mind).But all that criticism aside, this is an entertaining story and worth a watch."
" An Excellent Kidnapped Child Ring Movie With A Rock Solid Storyline Foundation
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,10,07/24/2018 A perfect movie that you do NOT want to pass by. Viewers will become immersed almost immediately. Plenty of twists and turns to hold any intelligent viewers interest. Much better than the current IMDb rating reflects. Bon Appetit
" Dud. Thump.
",2018-06-22 00:00:00,3,"Sometimes the writer shouldn't direct. Sometimes the writer shouldn't even write. This film is a shambles, a true mess."
" Worth watching!
",2018-06-15 00:00:00,8,Clever and a much deeper film then you would expect. Ends abit quickly though but definitely worth a watch.
" Real bad script, no character development, real real real bad acting
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,2,"It seems that the production paid loads of money to get Ryan Ronald on board to guarantee box office. Everyone else was really bad in acting. That is also obviously the fault of the screenwriter and casting director. The script had many faults in terms of plot and action. 
The characters are not at well paid attention to in the screenplay it shows. Atom Egoyan was super lazy in this film. Perhaps he had a cool 'idea' at first, but then I think it stopped at that. It wasn't dealt with properly."
" Interesting, but deeply flawed
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,4,"THE CAPTIVE is a Canadian kidnap thriller with an average plot, a decent cast, and pitiful execution. The problem with this one is that, rather than being told chronologically, this is all in non-linear fashion so there's a scene from one time frame followed by another from a totally different time frame, and so on. This non-linear sequencing has no merit at all and instead makes this a chore to watch. I have no idea what they thought they were adding to the film by including it. The rest is straightforward, with actors such as Rosario Dawson, Ryan Reynolds and Kevin Durand working hard to invest the viewer in their characters. It's an interesting film, but one that is deeply flawed."
" Simple
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,6,"I didn't like. Simple, I think should have more action and surprises. Good actors"
" A GIMMICK YOU DON'T REALLY NEED
",2018-04-27 00:00:00,6,"""The Captive"" is not your usual ""B"" film kidnapping/imprisonment film. The beginning is a bit confusing as it utilizes flashbacks which I didn't realize for the first 30 minutes, making this film a confusing mess to begin with. I will briefly sort out the first 28 minutes of the movie. If you don't want to know...stop reading.Cassandra (Alexia Fast/Peyton Kennedy) goes missing from the back of her daddy's truck cab. Matt (Ryan Reynolds ) her dad becomes suspect number one to the Niagara group ""Anything For Love"" headed by Nicole (Rosario Dawson). Matt's wife Tina (Mireille Enos) blames him and turns against him. Jeffry (Scott Speedman) who is part of Nicole's group is openly hostile toward Matt.Cass has special privileges as a captive and provides her captor with a unique service which makes this film a bit different. Matt tries to find Cassandra on his own (better than when OJ went looking for the ""real"" killer) while the group works without Matt.The film makes for a good ""B"" movie. It over utilizes the flash backs and really should have never had the flashback scene near the end which had me scratch my head...but wasn't she? How did? Oh a flashback. Of what? A day? A gimmick they really didn't need. Or was it a trick?A four star film that was cut to three stars by the director and editor.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Oy.
",2018-04-04 00:00:00,2,"So much potential on a great premise and great film with at least a partial message and they screw it up! Firstly, they should have made the location more anonymous so the subject is more universal. Second, why convolute the dialog with gibberish? Thirdly, far greater impact could have been achieved with sane appearing antagonists. Fourthly, would a spouse blame a partner to the end about him/her leaving a 9+ year old child alone for 2 minutes at a vacant location when he/she would have done the same? Next, why weren't the police called to the scene to check for forensics? Lastly, plot goes crazy after we've already lost reality in the plot. Painful to finish."
" A very good movie
",2018-02-14 00:00:00,9,"I don't undertand the bad ranting, the movie is well made, good actors and good story.
I really got into the characters, even the pedos xD
I liked it a lot, i'm guessing why people didn't like it is because of the scene changes, has past and present scenes mixed so SLOW people gets lost, i didn't and i loved that touch, gets the movie more intriguing."
" Much better than the rated score
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,7,"I'm going defend this film, I've probably watched 4 films a week for the last 10 years so we get through a lot of dross and have gotten to know what movies are like that are rated below 6, this isn't one. OK, so the ending could have been better but it's not a complete let down and the rest of the movie is well acted. I think the key to it being poorly rated is because it's eerily frustrating to watch which is definitely the intention here, if you can appreciate that then you'll like it as we did. There are some creepy performances and it's a bit twisted in a way. All in all it should be rated somewhere between 7 and 7.5, solid but not amazing, worth a watch."
" Was the promise kept?
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,7,"Here's a Better Late then Never Review of ""The Captive"" (R - 2014 - Canada)...I wish I'd met someone like you when I was a little girl.Genre: Thriller/CrimeMy Score: 6.6Cast=10 Acting=8 Plot=8 Ending=6 Story=3 Suspense=8 Pace=5 Camera=7 Crime=7 Twist=4Eight years after her disappearance, some disturbing incidents seem to indicate that she's still alive.

This was a great film in most aspects, but I hated the timeline. You can't have a movie jump back and forth over 8 years and leave Ryan Reynolds looking exactly the same. Looking deeper into the movie...you can find that everyone was a captive. Everywhere you turn there is someone that is themselves a prisoner. Was the promise kept? It might be worth it for you to find out."
" Missing Director Found Alive but Oxygen Deprived
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,2,"Imagine Atom Egoyan trapped in a sealed container. His air's running out and his captors force him to cobble together a script before they'll release him. Being trapped gives him a great idea for a story (okay it's a well-trodden path, the old girl-in-a-dungeon flick, but at least it'll get him out).The air thins and he rushes off a draft; they'll let him off with a bunch of ill-conceived plot levers and a plethora of implausibilities. No sane person would shoot this trough of swill. Right? Wrong. What's worse, they make poor Atom direct the thing himself, and the world can never know! Cue maniacal laughter. At least there was no voice-over. Reynolds was good; with such a bad script, the itch to overact must have been alluring. I cringed the whole way through for him.Awful writing, in the extreme, became strained acting and banal filming, became toe curling movie experience."
" Truly Awful
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,1,"This is a truly awful film - the only good part is Reynolds performance.It starts off with some promise then just deteriorates into a muddled mess.The story makes no sense and is just infuriating - the police suspect the father immediately without investigating any leads then 8 years later they still suspect him without any evidence! Well, apart from the fact that the detective is ""reminded of something from his past"" Jesus.Its full of clichés and some of the lines that the actors have to deliver made me cringe. In the end I was laughing, its so bad its funny.The bad guys are like something from a cartoon - but to be honest the actors do a decent job with a truly awful script.Honestly, don't waste your time."
" This is a terribly written and directed mess.
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,2,"I haven't written a review on IMDb since I was 15, but had to write something about this pantomime of a film. Awfully written, and the direction makes normally good actors look like 1st year students. It's a weird 2 hours of nonsense written and directed by someone who can't have met many actual humans. It glamorises human trafficking in a perverse and flippant way that is deeply uncomfortable. But not in a dramatic discomfort way, it's uncomfortable because it's awful and disrespects the subject matter. Really, really bad."
" Pretty darn good...
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,9,"Well, as others have said, I'm not so sure why all the bad reviews. I almost didn't watch this consequently. But I always have to remind myself of the backseat critics inundating IMDb. Things like Ryan Reynolds or any actor didn't (according to them) act or display the correct emotions, etc.... Maybe I'm just slow or easily entertained. I thought all the acting was very genuine and believable. I was totally hooked on the plot and suspense every minute. This was a great movie. Unless you are a wannabe movie critic that fancies knowing all about acting, directing, script writing, movie making... all while working your normal dead end job having nothing to do with the entertainment industry... you will enjoy this movie. That's what it is... a movie!"
" Positive Surprise
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,8,"""The Captive"" is one of the titles that is seriously underrated in my eyes. It tells us the story of a kidnapped girl and her parents, evolving into more general topics as child pornography or police work and questions of guilt. It plays on several time lines and doesn't follow a chronological order.In my opinion, the movie used its potential quite good. You can follow the story with a lot of empathy and thus understand the actions of the different characters. While there are some characters who are better shaped and written than others, all in all the cast delivered beautiful work. At times, the different time lines can be a bit confusing, because they switch quite rapidly and you really have to focus to fully understand the story. But this is a rather small point of criticism in an otherwise tension-full movie that doesn't get boring from the beginning to the end.All in all I'd advise you to give it a try. A lot of people seem to think different than me, but in my opinion this was indeed one of the stronger movies recently released in this sector."
" Captivating
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,10,"I'm trying hard to understand the rage against this film at the Cannes festival and the disapproval of other reviewers. As a mainstream thriller, admittedly, it's a bit weird, but I didn't for a moment think that Egoyan was trying to make a mainstream thriller, and I was riveted. What works, dramatically, to the maximum is the tension between Matthew and Tina (the couple whose daughter has been abducted, which is to say Reynolds who plays a man who refuses to believe that his daughter is dead and Enos playing his wife who tries to get over her daughter's presumed death by blaming her husband who let the girl out of sight for a couple of minutes), and the tension between Nicole and Jeff, the inept investigators who try to find out what has happened to the girl. This would be basic psychological thriller stuff, and it's good. But then there is the very weirdness of the film, its postmodern temporal disruption which forces us out of the thriller genre and into a more existentialist kind of film-with-a-message. Maybe I'm wrong, but the fact that Matthew and Tina seem to be living in a rural society and have their eight-year-old daughter kidnapped by hi-tech sociopaths who monitor their every move – this appears to be a jab at Facebook and the other social medias in which nothing is private, and which seem to steal kids from their parents and destroy the old-fashioned family idyll. And the psychos are portrayed as meek and mild criminals who are forced to prey on the lives of others since they have no life of their own. What also points in this direction (that the social media is the real villain, I mean) is the fact that the daughter, Cassandra, is not only a captive to the sociopaths but also a willing captive to her pseudo life on the internet. If I understood the film correctly, it picks up a theme from Egoyan's ""The Sweet Hereafter"" in which Stevens (Ian Holm) tries to cope with the deaths of a busload of school kids by trying to find someone to blame for the irrecoverable loss. To my mind, two strokes of genius stand out among all the rest (I did remember to click SPOILER, didn't I?). In the few minutes when the captors permit Cass to speak to her father, what she tells him appears to Matthew be non sequitur straight out of the Theatre of the Absurd but is in fact snippets from their last conversation eight years ago when she was abducted, and then her one remaining concern: whether her former skating partner Albert has kept his promise that he would never skate with anyone else (a promise which he has kept). And then, in the conclusive montage in the film, we (or at least I) can't see whether investigator Nicole Dunlap is still alive when they find the van where she is held captive. At least, I can't see her moving when the task force enters. I think it's a brilliant film, but not your run-of-the mill thriller."
" Compelling version of Persephone myth
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed and recommend ""The Captive"". I see it as a successful and interesting interpretation of the Greek Persephone myth, with some added twists. The role of angry, grieving, and distraught Demeter is divided between the mother, Tina, and father, Matthew. Other roles from the myth are also shared among some characters. Tina is tormented not only by the abduction of their daughter, Cassandra, and other events, but also by her situation. She works in a hotel overlooking Niagara Falls, a destination well known as the honeymoon capital, contrasting sharply with her angry and loveless situation separated from her husband.Matt continues to believe his daughter is alive. Items related to plants, growing things and summer are associated with Matt, a landscaper, as they are with Demeter. His daughter, Cassandra, is fairly stoic, intelligent, and determined like her father, mirroring some things similar to Persephone.Despite the story taking place over several years, we're only shown the winter season the entire time, similar to Demeter withholding the growing season until she was reunited with her daughter. She did what she felt she had to. The outdoor locations are used to great effect providing appropriately desolate and trepadacious feelings. The snowy landscape includes ancient rocks which are repeated on and in the granite stones of captor Mika's home. He convincingly portrays a modern, creepy gatekeeper figure with money, influence, and a variety of tools at his disposal.Whether this story has a good outcome or not, it's a poignant reminder that abductions, human trafficking and child abuse networks are ongoing issues that affect many people. Mythology continues to provide a timeless and proved framework for compelling stories."
" Disappointing
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,1,"I recognized the name of the director, turns out I've watched two of his movies before, ""Where The Truth Lies"" and more recently ""Chloe"", (neither of them memorable). My impression was a director trying to reach beyond himself. ""The Captive"" is not any better, and I actually want to say something about it.First of all, the movie flip-flops on the time-line arbitrarily, almost to the point of ""testing"" the audience's ability to track the narrative amidst all the ""flashbacks"". Whether it was the director's ploy to create style or atmosphere, the end result is just unnecessary confusion and frustration. Many of the plot twists were implausible: The most glaring one was when the experienced lead detective ""exposed"" herself to the predator online, despite her assistant/boyfriend's attempt to stop her. Was stepping right in front of the webcam in the middle of a video-chat session an attempt to scare off the predator, or challenging him to a show-down? Having exposed herself, she then blithely attend a public charity event to showcase her efforts to combat such cyber-crimes. (Of course she was promptly kidnapped for further entertainment of the predator.) Then the audacity of the predator is beyond comprehension, and he totally deserved to be shot. Allowing the ""captive"" to meet with her father was supposed to be an ego-trip, or some kind of ""death wish"" to surrender or get caught by the police. The one trick in the movie, where the daughter dropped a hint for the father to catch the predator, was handled so clumsily and obviously that it never created any suspense for enjoyment. Finally, it left wide open the possibility of complicity of other ""conspirators"" without any hint at resolution.Overall, this movie fell flat and failed to interest me."
