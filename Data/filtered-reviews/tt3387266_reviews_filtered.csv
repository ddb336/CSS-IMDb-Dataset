" Loved this film
",2021-04-11 00:00:00,10,"A beautiful story of love. Beautifully filmed
Well worth watching."
" A Rare Film Where Romance and Politics Unite
",2021-04-05 00:00:00,9,"Inspired by actual events, ""A United Kingdom"" concentrates on the heir to the throne of the African country that is a protectorate of Great Britain, Bechuanaland (which would later become the Republic of Botswana) name Setetse Khama (David Oyelowo) who back in 1947 was studying law in Great Britain, falls in love with a young, Caucasian woman named Ruth Williams (Rosamund Pike), who works as a secretary for. The London Missionary Society. Their love for each eventually leads them to getting married, Seretse wants Ruth to return to his country, but their love for each other is disapproved from everyone that they knew.Just like her previous outing ""Belle"", director Amma Asante created another real life story about true romance met in the realms of conflict and controversy, but succeeded in climbing over these hurdles and shows that true love bears no boundaries. Sure the couple has to overcome racism and disapproval from both their people, they were made for each other and nobody would stop them even going so far in the end when one side would learn to accept.Both films are run for 1 hour and 45 minutes long, shows that Asante will not tolerate wasted minutes of nothing on her movies. Every scene serves a purpose and the editing is something we truly have to thank. The script is handled professionally and Asante seems confident in the script that's given to her and has no need to add something at the last minute making issues feel forced or awkward.What makes ""A United Kingdom"" stand above a lot of politically themed movies is the outstanding, powerful performance from David Oyelowo. When makes an address to his people in Bechuanaland, the fiery intensity in his eyes manifest with determination knowing that his journey to becoming a leader will be a tough road ahead, but he will stop at nothing to get his message across. The speeches he delivers will likely get fans in tears because his messages are moving and also very inspirational. His voice is enough to melt you heart like a hot knife through butter. It seems that Oyelowo and Asante have known each for very long time and seems confident in selecting who would lead in her next film and she knows the capabilities that her leading performer will guarantee the best performer in her movie.The love that both Seretse and Ruth did not go by very smoothly, in fact the rough trenches seem more than most other romantic comedies. In spite of everyone surrounding them unhappy with their relationship, never let their guards down. Instead they held onto each other throughout until one of the parties gladly accepted them and became obscure pioneers in making a British protected colony in Africa into an independent country years down the road. There are a myriad of scenes where the the racial tensions are disgraceful in its presentation even going as far when a bunch of bigoted hoodlums were spewing off racist banter towards Seretse and even going far as to labeling Ruth with unflattering gestures. But in these scenes thanks to Asante's direction and Guy Hibbert's script, they don't go as far as to make it obvious and its never rubbed in our faces.After going full out in ""Gone Girl"", Rosamund Pike settles to more relaxed and nuanced performance. During this whole ordeal of falling in love with someone regardless of their skin colour she always remains calm. Instead of expressing her thoughts in words, she expresses her thoughts through the use of body language that's very symbolic (shaking of her arm). It shows that she is brave at standing up to someone she truly loves, and yet is still vulnerable and nervous at knowing that the masses are not to humble in expressing their disapproval of the choice she made making her character all the more believable. But her unrequited love for her Prince is all that matter and in the end she's brave enough to stand up to the hate.When it comes to the supporting cast, the real standouts include Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) as the bigoted Rufus Lancaster who also happened to play a bigoted buffoon in Asante's ""Belle"" and is quite convincing as a character who had a similar of mind like the people in this time period. Jack Lowden is wonderful as the only character who's in support of Setetse love for Ruth. His role was like a sigh of relief coming from a wide variety of hateful characters. Nicholas Lyndhurst was also effective in his performance as Ruth's father who doesn't want Ruth to marry Seretse.""A United Kingdom"" reflects back at an unpleasant moment in history. It was time when South Africa proposed the Apartheid Act and the shameless support that Great Britain had for it. Under all the abused power that came though this, one thing we could all be proud of is that several trailblazers had successfully overcame this burden and that is where we applaud Seretse and Ruth. The levity that comes with this movie is something that should be taught in classes at school, regardless of how heavy-handed the topic is.Amma Asante made this movie in 2016 at a time when romantic stories are not as popular then as it was in the 1990's, it's romantic tale is something off great importance. That even though it might drive two world's apart once the smoke clears the film ends up telling that these two are in love and nothing else matters. And even though the moral of this story might not be original, it's still warming and positive. With dynamic chemistry between the two leads, an outstanding supporting cast and the crew were at their A-game this movie is a winner to me."
" Fighting for Love and Freedom...
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,8,"This is a fascinating film that treads lightly between the land mines of racial and sexual and fomenting political unrest and comes through and on top of this with dignity and a sense of intelligent aplomb. The obstacles and hurtles that Seretse Khama and Ruth Williams Khama faced and overcame in order to achieve the greatest good on a personal level and on a romantic and familial level and ultimately on a sovereign and national level makes for exciting and memorable viewing. There is no doubt that a story of forbidden love wrapped within the political machinations of two countries; one maneuvering to exploit the riches of Africa in gold and diamonds, and the other seeking to mature into an independent democratic republic, can easily grip the viewer with a special exotic appeal. But in this case, the sensational is downplayed for a light, but probing examination of the relationships between peoples and time honored family traditions as well as cultural and national alliances. Rather than complicate and obfuscate the immediate issues at hand, the love the Khamas share between each other seems to clarify the central intention that love must lead the way to the resolution of all these issues.What I most admired was that this was a story of real people handling real problems in an adult manner with a workmanlike, no nonsense attitude and confronting in its turn each crisis and difficulty that arose fully aware of the sacrifices that might be required from them both. It speaks well of the performances of Daniel Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike as the title characters, that we always believe they have the personal magnetism and resourcefulness to win over their so-called respective clans and create the higher understanding necessary to make their marriage work. While in some respects we get the idea that it is them against a world that is chauvinistic and bigoted for gain, we never get the idea that they feel it is all about them. This is often the theme of great loves in romantic fiction and even in fact; that the love the partners feel for each other tends to cause them to blot out the whole world around them in the haze and heat of romantic passion. The love that the Khamas feel for each other appears in this film to call out the best of their spiritual resources, and lead them ultimately to come to those right answers and solutions that evolve and resolve into what is most progressive and salutary for everyone.The fact that these individuals used the happy event of discovering love between each other to solve problems rather than to be a problem to themselves and others is an inspiration worthy of note. How many other couples might have taken to drink, or caved in to the kind of despair that induces addiction and the slow slide into personal decay that can even lead to suicidal behavior? This has been the grist for many a drama about forbidden love. Here the lovers are always seen within the context of their respective communities, responding to their friends and families as well as to each other with a sometimes tense and heightened sense of reality and responsibility. The Khamas' love extroverts them, it seems to me, into taking greater social responsibility for conditions in their communities and societies, and this is a wonderful thing to witness and to have recounted.The direction of Amma Asante and the cinematography of Sam McCurdy make for a fine contrast between the environs of London and Bechuanaland. We see the man who would be King and his lady who would be Queen for more than a day, unknowingly forming a bridge toward a new sense of society. The supporting characters from Laura Carmichael as Muriel Williams, to Terry Pheto as Nadeki Khama, to Nicholas Lyndhurst as George Williams, to Vusi Kuene as Tshekedi Khama, as well as Jack Davenport as Sir Alistair Canning and Anton Lesser as Clement Attlee, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, serve to highlight effectively what is at stake in the formation of this union. The music by Peter Doyle is never intrusive to my mind and serves to spotlight moments in the lives of the principal characters with ample verve and style. We are never left to forget that in the end this is about two people maturing to create a family in the broadest sense of the term.We come to see that the consequences of the Khamas love for each other are on the whole good for all involved. Seretse Khama grows and evolves from renouncing his throne to being the first President of Botswana. Ruth Williams Khama eventually becomes First Lady Khama, although this is not addressed in this filmic version of their story. At the end of the film, it is revealed that their son, Ian Khama, becomes the fourth elected President of Botswana, as one of their four children. Ruth and Seretse end up buried together on a hilltop overlooking Serowe village, revered figures in the history of Botswana."
" A decent story about a decent pair of human beings.
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,7,"This is undoubtedly a beautifully shot film - cinematographer Sam McCurdy captures well the varied imagery from both Botswana and the less grand London urban landscapes wonderfully. The substance of the film, is a little less gripping though. It tells the true story of a student in Britain who is to return to his native Bechuanaland to take up his kingdom following the long regency of his uncle. His problem is that along the way, he has fallen in love with Ruth (Rosamund Pike) and so Seretse (David Oyelowo) finds himself amidst a storm of government objections to his relationship from both the British and South Africans, as well as an innate suspicion from his own people. Together they must fight for what they believe in - and that's no easy feat. The story is the stuff of history, so there is little jeopardy as to what actually happens. That leaves us with the performances and though there is nothing wrong with them; they just didn't really catch fire for me. There is a soupçon of chemistry between the leading pair, but the supporting cast - largely representing the colonial administration - leave much to be desired. Jack Davenport, Jessica Oyelowo and a particularly wooden Tom Felton left me cold as the epitome of what was wrong about the situation and the prevailing ""white"" attitudes. The way the couple were being manipulated - and separated - by the powers that be is also a bit too superficial. This could have presented us with a much grittier - politically driven - assessment of the enormous achievements of this man, but instead dwells too much on the courting/love story elements and we see little, if any, of the resistance from his own people to this fairly seismic, from a cultural perspective, marriage. It is engaging to watch, but could have been a great deal more interesting and informative had it focussed more on her efforts at, and difficulties with. assimilation too."
" Loved It
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,9,This movie was well-done. The actors executed the film and historical events brilliantly.
" A Remarkable Couple
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,7,"It is difficult to fully comprehend the battles this couple had to battle against,not least perfidious Albion.An excellent recreation of an important era,when the sun set on Empire."
" A United Queendom
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,10,"This is the true love story between a Black African Male & a White British Female. In todays climate you might think 'Welll...Nothing New! isn't it all part of living in a multi-cultural & multi-racial society?' Yes, but, this love story has 'deeper implications', and it's those 'deeper implications' that the movie focusses on, for this was no ordinary Black African Male, this was a man set to become King of Botswana - choosing a White British Female to rule by his side as queen.
I was more fascinated by the couple's 'gift of knowing'.
I mean when you meet someone how dya know that 'he's the one' or 'she's the one'? What moves people to stand strong against all the odds? What drives or motivates people to literally give up everything 'for love'?The movie was also an educational trip. Well we all know that 'Mother Africa' as a whole has been raped, robbed & stripped bare of all her past glories, so much so that she can no longer protect her children. Whatever she has left is usually pillaged by the locals. Unless it's a specific 'slavery' type of movie or programme, or there's a civil war or political unrest, or a 'wild life' programme, we seldom get to hear about 'other' histories on/of Africa or about Africa's Continent.I make Seretse Kahma's uncle right, 'Would The British Have Accepted It, If Princess Elizabeth Had Come to Africa & Taken a Black African Male To Be Her Husband - let alone an educated one? A Black King of England - Can You Imagine It? No You can't! Cos it'd 'NEVER HAPPEN'. But you can imagine the scandal can't you? That's exactly what Harry & Meghan are up against - 'Institutionalised Racism'.
Princess Elizabeth & her African husband 'Would Have Been Refused, And Every Rights & Claims To The Throne Removed From Her' - even if his name was Dr Bennet Omalu - a Nigerian - the forensic neuropathologist who made the first discovery of 'Chronic Trauma Encephalopathy', a football-related brain trauma - (as seen in 'Concussion' starring Will Smith).I think Harry's mother woulda been prouda him for standing up for 'himself'. As for the other son, she woulda been prouda him too, cos someone's gotta do the job."
" Botswana shines
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,10,I loved this film and it actually led to my photographer stepmother visiting Botswana out of interest in seeing the country Seretse helped build anew.
" Historically interesting, morally straightforward
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,6,"The hier to the traditional kingship of the people of Bechuanaland studied in England after world war two, and married a English office worker he met there. But after he returned home, the British, within whose empire his country then lay, cruelly banished him, principally not to upset the South Africans, who were busy instating their system of Apartheid, or racial separation, at that time. The story is sympathetically told in Amma Asante's film 'A United Kingdom'. The protagonists clearly had right on their side, and subsequently, as Botswana, their land has become one of Africa's success stories, so the sympathy is not misplaced, but it does remove any sense of moral tension (although not moral outrage) from the film. As a Briton, it's educational to see quite how appalllingly my governement behaved relatively recently, and interesting to see the role played by a young (and not yet famous) Tony Benn; but overall, this is a gentle, positive story, whose fault lines do not really trouble the modern viewer seeking to take sides."
" God save our queen !
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,8,"This story is not unique about the colonisation of countries in Africa, Asia etc etc. Britain has a lot to answer for. Stealing & raping countries of resources like oil, diamond, Gold & uranium continues until today. This is a love story but behind it all the message is about unfair colonisation & deep rooted racism that has been erased from the history books"
" Little bit disappointing
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,7,"Cinematography and the cast is wonderful, but somehow I felt emptiness. And boredom. Something is missing. By the way; this is another story to prove women are stronger than men ;)"
" Does justice to an incredible story
",2020-09-10 00:00:00,9,"Movies about monumental historical events present a high bar for those making them. When the movie is up to the task, it's a beautiful thing. to me, Schindler 's List is the gold standard in that regard. In my opinion, this movie is one that similarly lives up to its demanding subject matter."
" Great Movie!
",2019-04-10 00:00:00,10,"I live in Birmingham Alabama and I have noticed that African Americans are repulsed by peace between whites and them. If there are negative reviews towards this film they are more than likely coming from them. They refuse to watch any movie that has white people in it unless the main star is black. It is sad, but today the racism is coming mostly from them. It breaks my heart that we may never find peace among the races."
" Love conquers all but the film is stolid.
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,5,"The post war Labour and Conservative governments do not come out well from this movie. Both Attlee and Churchill are regarded as the greatest Prime Ministers in the 20th century. A United Kingdom portrays them as mendacious racists.Seretse Khama (David Oyelowo) is studying law in London in 1948. He falls in love and marries Ruth Williams (Rosamund Pike.)Ruth's parents disapprove of the marriage. However she is surprised that he is the heir to the throne of Bechuanaland, a province in southern Africa now known as Botswana.When Ruth visits Bechuanaland, Khama's uncle is against the marriage and it puts him into potential conflict with his own people.With neighbouring South Africa looking to instigate Apartheid, they object to the interracial marriage. The British Government under Attlee wish to placate the South African regime and look to exile Khama by offering him a post in Jamaica.As the territory also has valuable diamonds, it would be useful for Bechuanaland to become a crown colony so the diamonds belong to the British government.The drama is solid but apart from the two central characters, almost everyone else is rather shallow and two dimensional. I can understand showing Churchill as the dismal racist he was but here it is just about everyone. A United Kingdom is a well intentioned but dry film."
" Worth a look. Interesting story.
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,7,"Firstly, may I refer to the reviewer here who bitterly complained about the large number of people who gave this movie a rating of 1 or 2/10. I came across just four, yes four, reviewers who scored this movie so lowly. So the tirade that followed about racism and jealousy(?) seems somewhat over the top.
The film has many fine attributes - acting, cinematography, location, plot etc - alluded to by reviewers here.
However, the treatment of Ruth and her character development in Africa seemed somewhat underdone. Surely more emphasis on this aspect of the story was called for.
Overall, a very competently made film with fine performances from all and most certainly a very interesting story which makes one want to know more about the emergence of modern day Botswana."
" A great story to tell
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,8,"I love the story and so appreciate that it was finally brought to the big screen. And David Oyelowo was wonderful as always. But I think it could have been made perfect by better writing. The ""falling in love"" segment was so rushed that we don't really see it happening or feel it to be true. The British characters were cliche and one-demensional. The Botswana characters could also have been fleshed out more. Still, I absolutely recommend it."
" bom
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,7,Bom para quem gosta de filmes históricos e de políticas
" One line
",2018-10-26 00:00:00,6,"A cracking story, but an underwhelming ending. A brilliant performance by Oyelowo."
" Who will prevail?
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,7,A United Kingdom. Based on true story about the future king of (what will later be called) Botswana in the 1950s who marries a white English woman. Cue diplomatic problems on both continents. Who will prevail? An ultimately warm hearted and enjoyable 7 out of ten.
" Well worth a watch
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,8,"Seretse Khama, studying law in England as preparation for assuming his role as hereditary tribal chief in 1947 Bechuanaland, falls in love and marries a white English woman. This causes massive diplomatic problems, leading to the British government exiling him from his own country.This is a fairly straightforward dramatisation of a true story, set in post-war England and Africa. At a time when racial prejudice was still rife, mixed marriages were frowned upon generally and, given Khama's regal status in Bechuanaland (now Botswana), his marriage to a white commoner was unfavourably received in his own country. Yet this was almost insignificant next to the British reaction, where Ruth was more or less ordered by the government not to marry Seretse. And Ruth's father disowned her.The romance angle is more or less underplayed here. David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike have sufficient chemistry for us to believe they are marrying for love, even though this seems to be entirely on the basis of two or three dances and Seretse having a punch-up with some racist thugs.And when they arrive in Africa they encounter more of the same, only in reverse. This leads to a schism between Seretse and his uncle which, in turns, provides grounds for the British government (Bechuanaland was a British protectorate at the time) to exile him.The film is very good at evoking the 1950-ish era, especially in England, and the sense of time and location work effectively.Oyelowo and Pike do well as the fraught lovers, Tom Felton continues to impress in character parts, and Jack Davenport is brilliant as a supremely confident civil servant. Nicholas Lyndhurst is very un-Rodney-ish as Ruth's father.Very often, this sort of film is so concerned with the significance of the points it is making that it forgets to be entertaining (Idris Elba's Mandela movie comes to mind). But director Amma Asante follows up her previous movie Belle with a film which has something important to say, and which says it in an engaging, and sometimes moving, way.This left me feeling uplifted even though it, very conspicuously, did not leave me feeling proud to be British."
" Great history in film
",2018-04-13 00:00:00,7,"I like history in film. Nice recreation of the love of the prince with an english commoner. The film depicts it very well and makes points of the strenghts and weakenesses/flaws of all participants that contributed toward the good ending. Trade won the war, apparently, for the love."
" Had promise but failed to deliver
",2018-01-27 00:00:00,6,A United Kingdom appears more like a documentary than a film. For a story that was capable of having so much depth it was really a series of events thrown together to resemble a film. It never really flies. We do not see a great love story nor do we see a great story. A history channel short documentary could have covered these events better. The cast despite being good fails to carry this film. Historical films need to be made with a certain flair and style to captivate the viewer. Examples of where this has fallen short have been Lincoln or Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom where the director just showed us events with effects rather than telling us a story or taking us on a journey. 6/10
" compelling history
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,8,"In post-war London, Ruth Williams (Rosamund Pike) falls for law student Seretse Khama (David Oyelowo). She's surprised to be told that he's the heir to the throne of Bechuanaland. It's a poor sparsely populated country in southern Africa. Despite all the forces against them, they decide to get married. Her parents disown her. South Africa and other surrounding countries are imposing Apartheid and oppose their interracial marriage. The British Government first under Labour and then Churchill need South Africa. There is general racism throughout. There is segregation even in Seretse's own country. Government official Sir Alistair Canning (Jack Davenport) and commissioner Rufus Lancaster (Tom Felton) aim to impose British rule over the local population. Seretse is even opposed by his uncle Tshekedi Khama and sister Naledi Khama who sees Ruth as an outsider. The couple puts the idea of love conquers all to the test.This is a standard bio. I don't know much about this history and it's great to see it on the screen. It's also very fitting in the world today. I am also reminded of the upcoming Royal wedding in one of the scenes. It's easy but it's fitting. The central love story also works because the two actors are so sincere. There is nothing flashy about them or this movie. It's well told and suddenly relevant in the modern world."
" Wonderful story of love
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,9,"I never knew about this story, and enjoyed this movie immensely. Anyone that gives this a bad review did not watch the same movie that I did. It's a heartwarming story of love, devotion and racism in a turbulent time in the world. We owe much to the historical people of the past."
" In To Africa.
",2017-12-09 00:00:00,10,"Directed by Amma Asante (""Belle"") this is the true tale of a real-life fairy story, featuring a handsome prince and his love, who can never be his princess thanks to the Machiavellian scheming of court-do-gooders and bureaucrats. The prince in this case is Seretse Kham (David Oyelowo, ""Selma"") , heir to the throne of Bechuanaland (now Botswana), who meets and falls in love with a lowly white Lloyd's of London clerk Ruth Williams (Rosamund Pike, ""Gone Girl"", ""The World's End""). The plot has many parallels with that of another film from earlier this year:  ""Loving"" with Ruth Negga and Joel Egerton. As an inter-racial couple in 1947 this is taboo enough, but the fact that Kham is soon to be king in a country bordering the apartheid tinder-keg that is South Africa blows the affair up to be a diplomatic crisis.Defying the officials he marries his true love, driving a wedge between both his own uncle (Vusi Kunene ) and sister (Terry Pheto) and making Ruth an outcast in both countries. As things turn from bad to worse, can true love conquer all their adversities?Just everything about this film delights. Oyelowo and Pike - always a safe pair of hands - add real emotional depth to their roles. Their relationship feels natural and loving without either of them trying too hard. The estrangement of Ruth from her parents (particularly her father played by Nicholas Lyndhurst) is truly touching. Another star turn is Harry Potter alumni Tom Felton, playing Rufus Lancaster - a weaselly and very unpleasant local official. I have a prediction.... that in 30 year's time, the young Potter actor that will be the 'Ian McKellen of his day' (that is, a world recognized great actor... not necessarily gay!) will be Felton.  Sam McCurdy (""The Descent"") delivers cinematography of Africa that is vibrant (to be fair, for anyone lucky enough to visit Africa will know, cameras just love the place) and the John Barry-esque music by Patrick Doyle (""Murder on the Orient Express"") is pitch perfect for the mood.A beautifully crafted film that older viewers will just love. (For the graphical review, please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Moview on Facebook. Thanks)."
" I'd give it a 15 if I could!
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,10,"A wonderful beautiful, dramatic, compelling and sensitive film. It is a romance, a political drama, and an historical documentary all in one. The acting is superb. The cinematography both in sunny, scenic Africa and foggy, wet London is masterful. There are a couple of minor discrepancies. For example the word ""black"" is repeated many times but in 1947, the usual term was ""negro"" or ""coloured."" A few other discrepancies turn up in the ""goofs"" section. But they don't really matter nor do they detract from what in all respects is a cinematic masterpiece. It goes on my top five list!"
" Exquisite film
",2017-11-15 00:00:00,8,"I rarely give ratings of ""8"". Maybe 1 in 20 films. But this film is certainly deserving.In trying to find something to criticize...well, it wasn't easy. Perhaps at times the film moves a little too slowly. But that's about all I can criticize.It's filmed on location in both England and Botswana. The performance by David Oyelowo as Sir Seretse Khama, the traditional king and first president of Botswana, is exceptional. He's truly an actor to watch. I took me a while to be won over by the performance of Rosamund Pike as his White/British wife. All the actors do a very good job, but this film very much belongs to Oyelowo, and to a lesser extent Pike.I won't go into the plot or the history...but the film appears to be rather faithful to history.I was genuinely moved by this film."
" 'No man is free who is not master of himself.'
",2017-11-14 00:00:00,10,"A film that recalls the days of British colonization at its peak director Amma Asante brings a welcome light to the book by Susan Williams (Colour Bar) as adapted by Guy Hibbert. The cast is superb, the scenery and mood are well captured by cinematographer Sam McCurdy, and the musical score by Patrick Doyle takes us back to the 40s is a most appropriate and additive manner.The year is 1947 and Prince Seretse Khama (David Oyelowo) of Bechuanaland (now known as Botswana), in England studying law preparing for his ascendency to the throne as king, meets Ruth Williams Rosamond Pike), a clerk and in a fine romance they fall in love and plan to marry. While they suspect that his uncle (Vusi Kunene), the Regent, would disapprove, nothing prepares them for the diplomatic firestorm and domestic political tumult their defiant love would spark. Now facing a citizenry leery of a white Briton as their Queen, the international opposition is even more unyielding from the British holding their land as a protectorate and fearful of South Africa's racist backlash to this affront to their apartheid domination. Despite seemingly insurmountable odds King Khama and Ruth must struggle to maintain their love and help their people in a land that would become the Republic of Botswana. Ruth's parents (Nicholas Lyndhurst and Anastasia Hille) swear to disown Ruth while her sister (Laura Carmichael) supports the their love and plans. The evil British government officials (Jack Davenport, Jack Lowden, Anton Lesser, et al) ultimately fail in their intent to control Seretse and Ruth in a manner that few of us realized was such a difficult struggle for independence.This is a film that should be a 'must see' for all, especially now during the harsh racial struggles her and around the globe. Very highly recommended"
" Much more than just an inter racial love story
",2017-10-03 00:00:00,9,This isn't just about an African King marrying an English woman. It's actually quite an epic and significant true story about the country that became Botswana. This movie doesn't shy away from showing the blatant attempts at colonial plundering and exploitation by the post war British government of the time and even Winston Churchill in a bad light. This political aspect gives it quite a grand historic sweep recalling Gandhi in it's powerful message.Rosamund Pike is more expressive than usual and quite good. David Oyewolo is quite effective restrained and yet convincing giving dignity to the role.Worth watching. ALmost as good as Cry Freedom.
" A United Kingdom - A Story That Should be Told
",2017-10-03 00:00:00,8,"I knew so little about this slice of history and understand this could have much to do with the British government not being overly keen on talking too much about it. Although, as events turned out, it was support from the British public that had much to do with a better than average outcome. Based on factual events and beautifully photographed this movie has been somewhat neglected - as might be expected - for its lack of any explosions and action scenes. Those looking for an intelligent historical love story that involves King Seretes of Botswana and the white English woman he falls in love with, won't be let down by this uncommonly polished approach to storytelling.The early British scenes that make up the first half seemed a bit episodic but, this could have been in order to set up the characters for the serious testing that society and political institutions were about to meter out - across both hemispheres - on the principal couple. Some of the British officials also tend to be treated in an overly stiff-upper-lip- fashion but then, especially at this time (1940s-1950s), there existed a greater class divide so, much of this could be quite accurate. Most performances are first class (David Oyelowo especially) and Patrick Doyle's lush music score is an asset. Some may find elements of the screenplay a bit staid but it remains a treat for discerning audiences."
" Without much depth, it is a good movie
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,6,"It's a nice movie to watch. You will not find the movie of the year, but let's see. I do not understand, because many of the characters accept what they did not accept before, without having happened anything in the film. I just understand that the uncle accepts it.The script, when dealing with such a long story, gets too shallow in all subjects, does not get into anything in depth. But it's enough to make you aware of what happened.The actors are all well, no one stands out but none are left behind.Sometimes it is a bit sentimental, although fortunately, not too much.I like photography a lot, that in addition to being pretty, gets you into the movie, although I would have liked a more red Africa and did not fill the English windows with light.The management at least gets you bored, since the film is very English and the tempo is relatively slow but not so much to bore you. I do not like the little taste he has for the camera. He uses it without a sense. Just simple plans and do not follow a rule.It's a movie that you'll see right. But not beyond that"
" Feels familiar but still captivates
",2017-08-30 00:00:00,9,"A United Kingdom is based on the true story of Seretse Khama and the woman he married, Ruth. Seretse, heir to the throne in his native Bechuanaland, is sent as an orphan to study in London where he meets Ruth. Their union is frowned upon by all involved, with racial undertones and government meddling behind it. The movie shows the perseverance of the couple against all that.The story feels familiar, partly because we so recently saw David Oyelowo play Martin Luther King in Selma, another role where race was a major factor. Even though this is a love story at heart, many of the same beats are felt.That, however, doesn't take away from the impact of the movie. The viewer is given time to get to know the characters and their motivation and truly become invested. When Seretse and Ruth meet up against their various obstacles whether in London or Africa the emotion can be felt.The one thing missing from the movie is a true sense of growing unrest by the people being wronged. A key point in the movie is Seretse's banishment from his home to London, and while his people he would serve as king are shown to stand against it, there is never a notion that things could turn for the worse. It would have helped add to the tension if that had been shown, but the focus is clearly more of the love story between Ruth and Seretse.Overall, the film is highly recommended for its love story, its history and its portrayal of perseverance in the face of inequality."
" A Decent Period Piece with a Positive Message
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,7,"In a word, A United Kingdom is handsome. To loan it another, it's also stately; handsome and stately, stately and handsome. Both words immediately conjure memories of Enchanted April (1991) or anything adapted from a Jane Austen novel. The kind of movie with people walking down hallways and through courtyards looking flustered. Handsome and stately; But is it important?Director Amma Asante and screenwriter Guy Hibbert seem to think so, pitting the film's protagonists against Winston Churchill while evoking memories of no less than Nelson Mandela. Of course it has good reason to; A United Kingdom is not a work of fiction but rather an inspiring true story of an African king and a British subject who chooses to be his queen. The story of Seretse Khama (D. Oyelowo) and the lovely Ruth Williams (Pike) starts like most great romances do, with the intense locking of eyes and a world of obstacles lying in waiting. The two court and marry within the first act and make their way to Bechuanaland (now Botswana) where trouble takes the form of familial tensions and geo-political intrigue. Can their love survive the ever-mounting pressures of the British Crown and neighboring Apartheid period South Africa? Or will the marriage crumble like the infrastructure of what was then the poorest country on Earth.That very question, the limits of their undying love, forms the nucleus of A United Kingdom, the implications of which wrap the story like pink colored cellophane. The events of the film span a decade and during all that time, what we mostly get is the same sanitized story beats as a Disney Princess movie. Not much in the way of global politics or economics and nothing but what you'd expect as far as period appropriate racism. It's all done so safely; so demure and limited by superficial pomp.The irony of course is director Amma Asante seems to really care about these sorts of true-life stories. Her last film Belle (2013), worked within the confines of a stuffy period piece, to call attention to an obscure life at the nexus of racism and aristocracy. But while that movie had the luxury of gifting its audience something new into familiar wrapping, A United Kingdom can't really break free from its own limitations. We've seen this all before the only difference is the specter of Apartheid isn't personified by a severe man twirling his mustache.The British Empire however is personified in Jack Davenport and Tom Felton. Both play British functionaries whose sole job is to pull our two lovebirds apart, and boy do they ever relish their roles. Jack Davenport specifically is at pinnacle Larry Grey; his debonair smugness is so deliciously Anglo that birds would mistake his upturned nose for a littoral cave. Likewise Felton is the epitome of priggishness, a muscle he has toned and perfected with every Harry Potter (2001- 2011) installment. While I'm a little sad that franchise has relegated him to play weaksauce villains for the rest of his life, there's a consolation in knowing there are worse fates for child actors turned adult.As for Rosamund Pike and David Oyelowo, they both do splendidly; though is there any doubt that they wouldn't? Both are gifted actors and both do what is required of them which mostly consist of holding hands and looking like the weight of the world is on their shoulders.So A United Kingdom may not ultimately be an important movie. Yet its heart is unarguably in the right place. It manages to tell a lovely real-life Cinderella story with accomplished actors doing their best to do their historical analogs justice. The faults lay with the direction and tone of the film which certainly isn't enough to mar the film. Yet considering how safe it ultimately ends up feeling, I doubt the film is doing the legacy of the Khama's any favors."

" No man is free who is not master of himself
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,9,"This is a docudrama about Seretse Khama (David Oyelowo ) who was the son of a king of Botswana, a protectorate of England. While being educated in London in 1947, he meets Ruth Williams (Rosamund Pike) who he weds to the ire of nearly everyone on the planet, or so it seems. His marriage to a white woman upsets the neighboring nations of Botswana (Bechuanaland), especially South Africa introducing apartheid. They pressure the British government to prevent Kharma from tribal rule.The film looks at both the difficulty in the politics and personal lives of an interracial couple in segregated Africa. The production shows the couple as simple and humble. Rosamund doesn't appear to have make-up on for much of the film or own a comb. Election politics plays a role and Churchill is seen as a bad guy making hollow promises. I did not find David Oyelowo over powering in this role. Maybe it is just me, but I didn't like him as MLK or in Five Nights in Maine either. He was acceptable, but I am not standing up, lighting my Zippo, whistling, and tossing Frisbees.Guide: No F-words. Infrequent racial slurs. No nudity. A sensual scene."
" A beautiful story
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,10,"This was an amazing story of what happened! They did a fantastic job filming this and showing the story. I loved how they showed the scenery and the beautiful land that this took place in as well as the unjust done to this family and their people. I loved seeing the people come together and welcome, protect and thank a woman whom they did not want originally. This is a beautiful story of how love overcomes injustice, racism and political manipulation."
" A heartwarming visual experience
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,8,"Based On True Events, it portrays a historically accurate situation. Life is full of surprises, you never know when what will happen. A United Kingdom is the story of Seretse Khama (king of Bechuanaland) and Ruth Williams Khama and their unconditional love and its aftermath. The movie beautifully represents the racial conflict, colonial power, and its bad effect. You can never part a man from his homeland and also rule a land for a long time which is not yours. David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike gave us a pleasurable moment and an intriguing visual work."
" The story of two kingdoms.
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,8,"It got the mixed responses from all the quarters, but I had a little doubt that did I watched the same film! Because it was much better than what I have had heard from them. It's a biographical romance- drama from the director of 'Belle'. And like the inspiring life stories of Gandhi, Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr. et cetera, this one falls in the same line. All of their life events set in different kind of geopolitical scenario, so do this man's. But it was like differences in the family, which led to geopolitics. Anyway, the history book says, all the great struggles began with some game changing incidents like in this story.Seretse Khama, a king to be to a Southern African nation, now known as Botswana. His/this story was not filled with any violence. In fact, there were none, but political tension was at high. More or less, everything depicted in the film was like a chess game. Each opponent had their time with their pawns moved in the right direction to check their opponents. So he had to play accordingly for his nation and its people. I think he handled so well without any violence and that's why this film was merely a simple drama rather than packed with full of twist and turns and stunts.Like any biopic, it is an inspiring film. The implementation of non- violent tool to fight back was at its best in a film I've seen. Though, he was not like the most intelligent man, fighting it on his way, but an average man with a good education and character. The film opened with his final days in London as his law practice is coming to end. Then, unexpectedly, he meets a white woman. After going out with her for a few dates, they find love for each other. The real hurdle comes between them when the Britain government tries to break their relationship because it would affect their interest in his resourceful nation in Africa and peace with their neighbours.❝Let us not allow the ugliness of this world to take our joy away from us.❞As he was banished from returning to his native, separated from his family, how he works hard to bring the peace and stability to the region, especially to come out of the British oppression was the rest of the story to focus on. An amazing film. I liked it because it was not about heroism or working under a spotlight since he comes from the royal family. His simplicity of life and approach to all the problems was uplifting. I never heard that a nation ever got its independence without spilling a drop of blood. This is the one, at least for me. I mean no guns, or any other kind of weapons, except small, small protests impacting big way. But the big sacrifices were made in other ways. That's the major reason for I love it.Based on the book, 'Colour Bar'. The screenplay was slow, but it required to slow down to impact the atmosphere of passing time as the film spans with just important events for 4-5 years. So, assuming the film lacked depth is a misconception. Shot in both England and Botswana. The two different continents and its landscapes tell the story of its own. I mean the long distance between these two nations and distinct between the cultures, their own agenda to fight what's right for them. The initial part was like a pure romance film, and then suddenly the political tension takes the centre stage. Between the romance and politics, the narration keeps its flow without much progression in the middle section. Yet, impressive.As for me, Seretse Khama was a much, much better role than Martin King Luther Jr. that the David Oyelowo has played. But that role was more popular as it was an American. So this film needs a big uplifted, since the film has not reached a wider audience. Felt like I'm seeing Rosamund Pike after a long time. She was excellent as Ruth. The rest of the cast in the small parts were not bad. It was an Oscar product, but no one ever mentioned that. If you are interested in history of Botswana, particularly in the time surrounding its independence, you should try it. But I think it is a must see film, one of the best films based on a king, a freedom fighter and a husband.8/10"
" A United Kingdom
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,9,"A United Kingdom, is truly a fascinating film and the fact that it is based on a true story only enhances both the power and the overall affect the film has on it's viewers. This is a good example of a film that is very rarely made these days and yet when you get a film of this kind of quality and yet also a film that is truly inspiring and also leaves you cheering and elevates your mood while watching it, these are all the signs of a truly well done piece of art. The film also feels classic as it is also very tastefully done and there is really nothing here that is offensive, or that young viewers would not be allowed to see and it just shows that in today's culture and way of looking at things that you truly do not need excessive language, sexuality violence, or any kind of various depravity and or, immorality to tell a good story, or to make a film in any way more appealing, or commercially successful. Unfortunately as A United Kingdom, was originally released in theatres several months ago, it was not a big box office success which is truly a shame because I think if it had been more heavily advertised that you would have had more people going to see it and perhaps also people who normally stay away from theatrical motion pictures these days who will actually come out and see a film like this because of not only it's wholesome qualities, but also the fact that it is telling a story that is not only riveting, but powerful and inspiring all the same. It truly makes what comes to the theatre on a weekly basis look like absolute junk because as said earlier this film does not need to sink down into depravity, or offensive content to tell an interesting story and to tell it very well. The acting here by it's two leads is fantastic and I have enjoyed both David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike in various other roles as well and here they continue to prove what great and versatile performers they truly are. And with Oyelowo with films such as Selma and The Butler, both of which I had a few issues with, I do truly have to commend him over his choice of roles as he does not seem like the kind of actor who will sell out, or do a film that is offensive, or vulgar, but instead he seems to choose films that in their own way are both inspiring and gives the viewer a lot to think about. He also plays characters that seem to be good role models and characters who not only respect themselves, but also the people around him and I think he is truly paving a great way for younger actors and those who just like to watch films with roles of truly commendable characters and people and I think that is more rewarding then say playing in a silly box office hit, or degrading himself by starring in offensive, or lewd pieces of work. A United Kingdom, is generally a very moving film that chronicles in the late 40's as well as 1950's, the kind of racism that was going on both in Europe and around the world as well. Often you look at the characters and the oppression and hatred these two leads experienced just because they were a couple of mixed race and I truly was horrified at times while I witnessed not only acts of violence and words of hatred directed towards them, but also the level of ignorance and bigotry within my fellow human beings and the fact that this story is true and all these events happened is a depressing thought at first, but then when you look at how everything turned out and how these two people persevered even at the most difficult of times and facing oppression and hatred both from forms of government to their very own family members to the point where they truly proved that a dedicated couple who are sworn to each other and who never give up on one another will truly achieve great things and that they will find their happiness. The supporting players here are all excellent as well and the writing is good because of how it deeply explores the issues of hatred we have towards each other and the levels and lengths we unfortunately as humans will go to see that it stays that way, but it also shows that love and acceptance truly will overcome and nothing is ever so bleak that it can not find it's way out of it's troubles. This is a film that not only should be seen by young people, but will be a film that I think will truly be embraced by audiences who unfortunately didn't see it the first time. Now is your chance which I hope you won't pass up."
" So Underrated here!
",2017-06-30 00:00:00,10,"I agree with those who are skeptical of anyone giving this masterfully made film a low rating. The script is superb; the acting, nuanced. It's been a while since I enjoyed a movie this much.Furthermore, I must wonder (given U.S. racial tensions catalyzed by our last outside-influenced presidential election) what the political persuasions might be of some of your reviewers because film buffs, they most certainly are not."
" One of the more decent films of 2016 and 2017 combined
",2017-06-15 00:00:00,8,"6.8 does not do justice to a film that tells a story of how love can overcome boundaries. In this case, this is one of the rare African stories that we tend to get to hear about. For a long time, stories to do with Africa have been about disease, poverty and undernourishment. Asante's take on this film does indeed tell the viewer that there is more to Africa than what meets the eye.I believe that this film should set a precedent for more African stories to be told . This film tells you that there is a lot more than just about Mandela. There is need to learn about other Africans namely Jomo Kenyatta, Hastings Kamuzu Banda, John Chilembwe and many others. These are perhaps some of the few names that I can think of. I commend Asante for taking a bold stand in producing a film of a figure(s) that most people out there may have not heard.For those of you that may want to get a different side to Africa, I would recommend that you begin by watching ""A United Kingdom"". In my view, it is one of the more decent films of 2016/17 combined."
" True story even more unjust
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,6,"I must confess I was completely ignorant of this historical episode, and had the uncharitable thought it might be severely exaggerated, but no, a bit of fact-checking courtesy of the disinformation superhighway reveals that if anything they played it down. The new bride was in fact sacked from her job with Lloyd's of London when she refused to obey orders from the government.And the marriage we see in the film at the local registry office was actually their second attempt, after the priest who had his church set up to marry the two of them had a call from his bishop on the morning of the day it was to take place, ordering him not to perform the ceremony.Perhaps those scenes will be in the outtakes on the DVD!"
" A good romantic movie.
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,6,"Well, A United Kingdom is not an extraordinary movie but it wont disappointment us. Its a good romantic movie. Not best in the recent times but good. The lead actors and the supporting actors did a decent job. The cinematography is excellent. The stunning visuals of Africa keeps us amazed throughout the movie. We feel lack of good direction in certain scenes. Overall, A United Kingdom does not disappoint us. A one time watchable visually stunning movie."
" We liked it
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,7,I think this was a story worth telling. We love movies based on true stories and learning about things we didn't know. And this one was very enjoyable. It was much better than we expected. You really get to side with the characters and root for them. Even a small tear may be shed with this one. I would recommend (even if it's not a 10).
" Inspiring untold story
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,8,"I love it when a story is told that many of us haven't heard of or known much about.Although possibly oversimplified due to the necessity of keeping the movie within a normal viewing time, nonetheless, it's a very good story about an amazing piece of history.Well acted, well directed and beautifully filmed, this is a film I'm very happy to have seen. It's an inspirational look at enduring love and intelligence, at people power and a nation's faith in their leader, as well as credibly showing yet again how the British Empire and their bevy of crooked prime ministers deem to destroy nations for greed and profit, and to boot, having the gall to treat anyone but themselves as underdogs.An excellent film for what it is and I would recommend it."
" A true and beautifully portrayed contemporary history
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,10,"I lived in Botswana for twenty-five odd years and enjoyed every single moment of it, almost certainly due in large measure to Seretse's enlightened politics and the genuine and natural warmth of the Botswana people. I knew both main characters quite well. Seretse was a very approachable man, even as president, and it was a pleasure to spend some time in his company. He was a man well loved by everyone, black and white. In fact, in Botswana one scarcely thought in those terms. As a politician he had huge charisma and was a great orator. He was also a born leader. I remember well being told by insiders that government Ministers who were in trouble for minor abuse of office or the like, would tremble in fear outside his office when they were to be 'carpeted'.Ruth was an extraordinarily capable woman and even in her later years had more stamina than almost anyone I have known. She was at work in her office in Gaborone from early morning to the end of the day, patron of the Red Cross, Botswana Council of Women etc etc. Contrary, however, to one reviewer's criticism, Rosalind Pike's portrayal was quite accurate. She was not a strident campaigner but a very effective mover who enjoyed a social life and had many friends. In her widowhood she received constant visits from senior members of the tribe and government and was widely loved and respected by her people. She was most certainly ""Mohumagadi"" - Mother of the Nation.This film portrays their personalities pretty accurately and the characterisation of the actors is extraordinarily true to life. Both David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike were absolutely convincing. The quality of the acting very quickly overcame my initial niggling concern that the physical likenesses were not quite there. The photography of Botswana was outstanding and the familiar views of Serowe from the Palapye 'road' and the scenes in the kgotla were quite emotional for me; I unexpectedly found I had a lump in my throat.I can understand that, for others, the film may not have the immediacy it has for me, perhaps, but previous criticisms of 'cold' and 'unemotional' - No! Leaving aside my personal interest, it deserved to be the opener for the London Film Festival. Maybe not a total ""blockbuster"" but an unusual and great film nonetheless. Very close to fact."
" Great Movie and Hidden Jewel.
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,10,"This is one of those movies that is flying under the radar and deserves to be seen. It is a wonderful story, well scripted, well acted, and has terrific cinematography. The fact that is a true story makes one wonder what the hell we have been learning in school when we have never been taught this type of history. I give this a ten and really it deserves it. It is a shame people have degraded the rating for some reason other than the fact that this is good cinema. It is a very deserving movie and is like the movie Hidden Figures or Queen Katwe, it is important for history. I am a white conservative and think everyone should see the movie."
" Wonderful love story
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,10,"What a great story and so well done, with ""Danny"" from Spooks and ""Jane"" from the best ever Pride and Prejudice how could it fail! I thought the build up to the couple falling in love was believably done. Black and white didn't come into it, just the attraction and developing love of two young people. I love the way music - a worldwide language - was one of the things that drew them together. The parents reaction to a black man being brought home was totally realistic (believe me - been there done that) and the prejudice against Ruth from Seretse's people was so well handled, you respected and understood their reactions yet cheered on the behaviour of Seretse, he was so beautifully honourable. He showed respect to his people but refused to give in to pressure from them, the British and his in-laws, he stuck up for the woman he truly loved. As for Ruth, amazing woman, she patiently waited for acceptance - and stood so faithfully by her man and in real life continued to be very much part of the Botswana community after her husbands death. The poor old Brits don't come off too well but those were the times and world they were battling. If you missed this at the cinema do make sure you catch it on DVD it's just a great true story. Leaves many so called ""romances"" for dead - this really is about love."
" Powerful story beautifully told
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,7,"At first I thought this movie would ruin this story. It's a painful, yet hopeful and loving chapter of African history. This is NOT a love story. If people should come to watch this movie hoping for a ""love conquers all"" plot... They should be very disappointed. And I'm fairly glad for that. I congratulate the director, Amma Asante, for rendering this story into the big screen with delicacy and respect to all involved. I thank her for realizing all this story was NOT, and putting it out for the public from the first frame. I also love her for showing almost everything this story was about, without going into great detail.This movie is based on the true relationship between the King of (now) Botswana, Sir Seretse Khama, and a white British woman, Ruth Williams. Today we might know Ruth and Khama as leaders in the fight for the country's independence (since it was, when they married, a British protectorate), but their struggle started way sooner. Their story became their country's story. A fight for their right to choose. It's not about their love. It's about his choice, not to marry within his tribe's customs, and her choice, to up and leave her home, building herself a new life from scratch. It's about a country's choice to their leader - and how much the world hates him, her and the country for the nerve to demand their voices be heard with such fire. Amma Asante thrives on sewing up Seretse and Ruth deep within the political setting, in a beautiful dance, until we cannot see the lines between them. She also shows how much resistance change can face - and overcome. Their marriage becomes a set of lens for the viewer to analyze strength and frailty confined in this tiny world full of hope. And it gets you going. Rosamund Pike and Daniel Oyelowo are simply superb. His performance here is stronger than Selma's, which is saying something. And though Pike had less screen time than Oyelowo, her presence is felt throughout every scene. It doesn't fail. Pike gives a poignant performance of a true turnaround in life, and she gets us engaged with her every move. She doesn't have to show her face; every spin this movie gives gets the viewer thinking about Ruth's reaction, thanks to her powerful deliverance.With that power couple, I thought the supporting cast would be weak and acceptable... I was surprised. Again. Tom Felton, Jack Davenport, Laura Carmichael (why, hello, Lady Edith!), Terry Pheto, Vusi Kunene, Jessica Oyelowo and Abena Ayivor, to name a (very) few, were splendid in their roles and really brought the tension between marriage and politics alive. Cinematography is delightful, which goes really well with the dazzling music score. The somber tones of post-war London are contrast to the joyful sounds and colors of the southern borders of Africa; yet you hear pain in their laughter as well as you see smiles in British tears. Everything is designed to really bring the viewer there and then. It's an interesting and delicate take in a true story, that happened not so long ago. It's a solid 7, because of historical inconsistencies throughout the film (the lasting of the protectorate, Indian's ruler at the time of independence, and so on), but it's definitely worth at least a screening."
" Savagely under-rated, A United Kingdom is 2016's hidden gem
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,9,"A United Kingdom is a true and gripping tale which handles it true historical source material with aplomb. With fantastic performances from Oyelowo and especially Pike, the central characters plight is beautifully illustrated. It's not perfect; some of the writing is a little clunky, but the character chemistry is there, and you leave the movie theatre feeling like a part of the story.Quite how this movie receives the rating it does is completely beyond me. I can only imagine that half the voters didn't in fact see the movie."
" Well done history lesson
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,10,"A great history lesson I am sure most of us were not taught and are not aware of.A United Kingdom was very well done, straight to the point without throwing in of unnecessary embellishments...as films are known for when it comes to true to life stories. I prefer the facts with a bit of flare but when it comes to history; hopefully, someday film makers will come to the realization a lot of extra fluff does not make the story more interesting it just muds up the facts. I suppose there is a fine line between a movie and a documentary. This movie was perfectly told.David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike couldn't play their parts better, they were exemplary. Good choice of actors.A well deserved 10/10."
" Beautiful Interracial Love story overcomes Racism, Bigotry & Hatred
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,10,"20 March 2017: I Love and support ALL Interracial Love, marriages, and movies or television shows with men and women in love and Biracial people. But not just mix races of Blacks & Whites, but any man and woman of two different racial backgrounds. So I had to see and support this film, the same as I have with All Interracial movies such as the recent; ""Lovings"" with actress Ruth Negga. My all time favorite is ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" with Sidney Poitier and Kate Hepburn.One of the things I liked in the beginning of this film is that we see them meet, have a nice time and go dancing and the White people dancing in the background are Not staring at them nor giving them a hard time. I wish all the world would be like that when a man and woman of different races and skin tone meet, date and fall in love. God and Jesus Christ/ Yeshua do NOT see skin color, God only sees the heart and mind. This role hit home for David since his real life wife is also a Caucasian woman and they are truly in love with four kids, just the same as actor Nate Parker and his wife.Anyhoo, racism soon shows it's ugly head starting when David and Rosamund are walking at night and three White racist bigots and one yell the word ""coon"". Later we see Ruth standing up to her own father for the man she loves and later when Khama stands up to his racist uncle for his love of a White woman. Although, I understand the point that in his African country, where the tradition has always been all Africans living, loving and marrying and that is to be expected of a future king. So the racism is not quite the same as blatant hate due to skin color, but hate is still hate in all forms and love is love in all forms.My wonderful Latina daughter-in-law once told me that ""love is love and it is beautiful with all men and women."" However, I said that love between two people of the same race, skin color, and nationality is easy, but it takes an extra special love and strength to love a person of another race and skin color to stand together in love against hatred in all forms. For those who know, this is what great martial artist actor, Bruce Lee's wife, Linda Lee did when she (a White woman) fell in love with a Chinese man and stood up against her own mother for the love of her life.I have like the work of English actor, David Oyelowo since his film ""Red Tails"". He was great as MLK in ""Selma"". I have not seen much of English actress, Rosamund Pike, but I did see her in a James Bond and Tom Cruise film. This film was great from start to finish. Love and Hate comes in All skin colors and in this film we see it from both sides, which proves my point. It takes a strong person, mentally and emotionally to stand up to racism in all forms from family members to so call friends and co-workers to say to the world, I love this person and it does not matter the skin color.I give this film two thumbs up for another beautiful Interracial Love story between men and women."
" This is a film that is very much in love with its own story.
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,7,"A United Kingdom is a film that is very much in love with its own story. Director Amma Asante is obviously very passionate about the subject of this movie, which is about how a biracial couple in 1940s Africa nearly tears apart an entire village and breaks down the relationship of colonial Britain and Africa. We feel Asante's passion for racial equality, and social justice. We clearly see how adamant she is about doing what is right for a nation, rather than fattening one's own greedy pockets. That's all very evident. However, the one thing Asante fails to do, and a glaring mistake of the film, is that she ignores the core of the relationship between the two main characters involved.David Oyelowo (Selma) and Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl) play the interracial couple. They are both very invested in their moments and the actors both allow their care for this story to show through their performances. However, their relationship is not at all developed. I found myself caring more for the people of the village than their relationship. The issue as I see it is that Director Amma Asante skipped past all of the expositional development stage of their relationship. About 20 minutes into the movie we are already in Africa and the conflict of the story has already changed. It changes from 40's race relations in Britain, to diplomatic struggles between Africa and Britain. But we never truly get to know these people. Pike plays Ruth Williams, the white Londoner. And, Oyelowo plays Seretse Khama, the King of Botswana. We quickly see how they meet, how they feel, what their families and friends think and then they're married and are in Africa. But we're missing something very essential when it comes to a successful cinematic relationship and that's relational conflict. Despite the fact that Ruth's family is against their marriage and so is Seretse's, we don't how they're affected by it. There's never a moment of problem between the two of them. Essentially, we never see the events in which their relationship is strengthened by adversity before they're off to Africa. That poses an issue going into the second act because, all of a sudden, we're given new conflicts, characters and situations. And, we have to fill in the blanks and imagine that their relationship is one worth fighting for.However, once we get to Africa and the colonial conflict starts as well as the conflict within Seretse's family, we're caught up to speed. Asante takes us on a plot of cheer and disappointment and we are never for a moment bored. We're never not entertained and we get sucked into their story and applaud the wars they win amidst the battles they lose. For those reasons, I give this film 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18.Reviewed by Willie J., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
" Most overlooked movie at Awards time.
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,10,"There must be a plot to put people off this fine film or I'm a lousy critic..This is a beautifully produced British film based on a true story set in the late 1940's early 1950's about an African Kings choice to marry the woman he loved and his battle with British Colonialism and his white wife's battle with reverse racism from his people.Wonderful performances from Rosamund Pike and David Oyelowo.Why this film has been egregiously overlooked for at least Best Actor and Best Actress Oscar nominations is beyond me. It passes all my criteria for a good movie it's entertaining, informative superbly acted and most importantly it touches the heart and inspires us to know that no matter what Political regime is in power if it's elected representatives are motivated by hate ,fear, racial intolerance greed and self interest that we must fight back with words and express our anger at the injustices perpetrated by its leaders.Does this sound familiar in today's world?I notice IMDb gives this movie only a 6:7 rating but read the film going publics reviews and they express a different view.I think a must see movie catch it before it disappears .."
" Can love triumph over prejudice?
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,9,"The English film A United Kingdom (2016) was directed by Amma Asante. It's an interesting love story, based on real events. David Oyelowo plays Prince Seretse Khama, a young African man studying law in London. Rosamund Pike plays Ruth Williams, an intelligent, fun-loving civil servant. They fall in love, and we know that their marriage will be a difficult one, because of prejudice both in England and in Africa.What we don't know is that their marriage has implications far beyond each of them. In 1947, South Africa was gearing up for its apartheid program. Bechuanaland was a British protectorate, and Seretse Khama was its rightful prince. However, South Africa borders Bechuanaland, and the South African government refused to tolerate a mixed race couple in a neighboring protectorate. That meant that not only did Seretse and Ruth face prejudice from the people around them, but they were pawns in an international standoff in which Great Britain was willing to sacrifice them to appease South Africa. What happened next became the plot of the movie.David Oyelowo is a superb actor. So is Rosamund Pike. Ms. Pike has 42 movie credits, but I believe the only other film in which I saw her was Pride and Prejudice (2005), in which she portrayed Jane Bennet. I reviewed that movie for IMDb, and wrote that her performance was ""luminous.""Director Asante is skillful, and the acting and cinematography are wonderful. We saw the movie at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It won't work quite as well on the small screen, because the film has some breathtaking scenes of the African desert. For some reason A United Kingdom has a dismal IMDb rating of 6.7. I don't understand this--it's much better than that. Find it and judge for yourself."
" Good and Effective For What It Was Trying to Do
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,8,"I had never heard of this story, so it was fascinating to learn about it through the movie. What was interesting was that while the heart of the film was Oyelowo and Pike's relationship, it wasn't necessarily the focus of the movie. The first half features them falling in love and marrying, and the second half is about the political repercussions, and the Botswanans attempts to gain independence from the British. It's almost as if everyone in the film used the relationship as an excuse to act on tensions that had been building for years. So in that regard, I was surprised. The performances are also brilliant. David Oyelowo absolutely shines in this film. I think he was ultimately better in Selma, but he turns in an A-grade performance that unfortunately is being overlooked. I do think Oyelowo outshined Pike, but she was still very good. The two had excellent chemistry, and worked beautifully together on screen..."
" Oyelowo yay
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,5,"Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes I just know immediately that I'm going to be out of touch with popular opinion on a movie, and this historical-romantic-biopic from director Amma Asante (Belle) and screenwriter Guy Hibbert (Eye in the Sky) is one of those times.It's a crowd-pleaser featuring David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike in a real life story with some similarities to last year's Loving (the chronicle of Richard and Mildred Loving's interracial marriage). Mr. Oyelowo plays Seretse Khama, a 1947 university student in London when we first meet him. Ms. Pike is Ruth Williams, a local Londoner working clerical at an insurance company when the two meet at a local dance. The attraction is immediate.Not long after, Seretse discloses to Ruth that not only is he in love with her, but he's also the King-in-waiting for Bechuanaland in Africa. The marriage is met with dissent from all fronts: family (racism), Seretse's people (cultural and societal reasons), and Great Britain (mostly concerned with appeasing its ally South Africa and the growing notion of Apartheid). Seretse and Ruth believe their true love is strong enough to win over those dissenters. The backlash is much worse than anticipated.A very cool element with the film is the use of the actual house Ruth and Seretse lived in, and the locals were more than willing to contribute. While the strength of these two individuals remains inspirational to this day, the film falters in a few ways. Both Jack Davenport and Tom Felton are stuck playing British foils in the overwritten manner in which we would expect from a 1940's movie on TCM. Again acknowledging my out of step opinion, Ms. Pike simply lacks the range for such a role. Her deer-in-the-headlights go-to facial expression is a slap to the courageous woman she is portraying.However, the biggest issue with the film is its lack of continuity  its choppiness, if you will. So many scenes abruptly end right as the substance is beginning. Multiple times we are left hanging, wondering why we don't get to finish a conversation or finalize a conflict. There are some terrific moments that are torn apart by the numerous butchered scenes, though the strong performances of Oyelowo and Terry Pheto (Tsotsi) as his sister shine through.This is a terrific and interesting piece of history that deserved a better film. In 1966, Bechuanaland gained its independence and became what's known today as Botswana, and the story of Seretse and Ruth is one that needs to be told. Most viewers likely won't be bothered by the things that irritated me, and that's probably a good thing."
" I was not all that impressed outside of learning something I did not know.
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,6,"Their story was amazing. A king of an African country experience apartheid because of his country's closeness to South Africa. The only reason he could eat in restaurants and go see a movie in his country was because he was king, but any old white dude did not need such a large stature to do the same (It's like that Chris Rock joke about how he could only live in the neighborhood he lives in cause he's a famous comedian while his white neighbor is just a Dentist). The king gets educated in Britain and meets a white woman that captures his heart like no other, which opens up a new can of worms for his country facing apartheid.Though I did learn something new, I should point out that overall this movie is a love story. The focus of the story is more about love conquers all, and I'm not sure how accurately the film is, but it's definitely a very sweet film, about the challenges of Interracial marriage in a time and place that did not want these two to be together.For that it was a good movie to see, hard to say which is better This or Loving, which is about the same thing, but I thinking Loving had some better acting. David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike could have done better.Very OK.http://cinemagardens.com"
" Dull history lesson.
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,5,The most interesting thing about the movie is the number of exterior scenes shot at sunset. Eventually you realize it was too hot to shoot a movie in the heat of the day.Good performances can't overcome a static cardboard script. Rather then grabbing you emotionally you get the idea you are watching an in school history movie. The movie lacks urgency and passion.Like many true stories the highlight was seeing the actual people portrayed in the movie before the end credits. There are a few Africa shots that look good on the big screen but for the most part there are plenty of two people dialogue scenes that would play better on a home platform.
" THIS is how you fight for what matters.
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,8,"Based on a true story of romance and politics, Rosamund Pike and David Oyelowo play Ruth Williams and Seretse Khama, an English girl and the King of Botswana whose relationship is disapproved of by their families and governments. Our hero and heroine rebel in a matter-of-fact way that is built on the foundation of their utter belief in what they deserve: what the world deserves, and what they know they will get. Undoubtedly. Not because they are desperate, but because it matters. At one point on the phone Ruth asks ""are we giving up?"" calmly and firmly, with a hint of feigned casualness. They must and will be together. That is certain. If being together were their only wish, it's easy: they could run away together and be wherever. But their commitment to having it all is inspiringly defiant. This is what happens when intelligent, kind, and determined people fight for their essential values. This film shows how social issues in politics have to be felt personally for change to be urged into motion."
" A Gorgeous Cinematic Experience
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,9,"A UNITED KINGDOM (UK) Dir. Amma Asante (Belle)This was an extremely beautiful film, both in its inspirational storyline and in its cinematic expression. It involves real-life 1948 interracial love story between Prince Seretse of Bechuanaland (now Botswana; played by David Oyelowo) and an English office clerk (played by Rosamund Pike). According to the film, their marriage affronted her parents, his subjects, both the English and Bechuanaland governments, and eventually jeopardized British colonial rule in Southern Africa and beyond.It is a beautiful narrative, sweetly told and set in a sweepingly majestic African landscape. It is a beautifully shot period piece, and reminded me of OUT OF Africa and THE English PATIENT.Scoring the Film Components (out of 4 points)Script/Story: 4; a compelling narrative based on real, historical people. Very well written; strong characters set against challenging situations where they overcome odds.Cinematography/Visual Effects: 4; excellent work by cinematographer Sam McCurdy.Editing: 4, very well put together. Very fine.Sound Effects: 3.5; extremely competent sound/sound mixingMusical Score: 4; sweepingly grand musical score. Did not catch the name, but very similar to John Barry's work in OUT OF AfricaPerformances: 4, very strong performance by the two lead, and rally from the entire cast.Production Design: Sets, Locations, Costumes, etc.: 4; excellent production design. Love the period costumes, the period sets, London and the African locations, all very evocative of the period and helped to move the narrative forward. Loved it.In sum, an extremely enthusiastic thumbs up for this film. An engaging storyline; beautiful pacing; stellar production design and compelling performances. Best Picture Oscar contender, as Fox Searchlight has picked it up for US distribution (according to the Q&A). SEE IT!"
" An important story told with power
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,9,"I went to see ""A United Kingdom"" having only known of the movie and of the true story behind it from a newspaper review. That one damned it with faint praise, so I wanted to see if the movie was as lacklustre as claimed. Well, it was awesome. It portrayed a true story which to me raises its value - this was a story of Britain's colonial (fairly recent) past, but most of us were surely ignorant of it. It puts the British response to Gandhi (India was progressing to independence at the same time) into context. The lead actors were superb. They unfolded the story with emotional restraint - I was sitting thinking ""how on earth would I respond in that situation?"" A movie that allows you, even encourages you to entertain those thoughts is produced and directed with respect for the story, for the real people behind the story, and for us as viewers. Well done, all concerned. I imagine it will be loved in Botswana."
