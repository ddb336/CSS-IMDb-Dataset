" A lesser Blade + Constantine
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,5,"Somewhat entertaining but forgettable movie that turns the Frankenstein's Monster into a semi-superhero. Some decent action, with below average acting, zero interesting story line, a bored villain, but at an entertaining pace."
" Stunning visuals
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,7,"The storyline is a unique take on Frankenstein, adding an angels/demons aspect. Though a few plot points are forced, it mostly works. The visuals; however, are stunning. I love everything about these gargoyles, that wing to cape thing is amazing."
" Greatly entertaining movie, bad reviews are people having a bad day or sth...
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,8,"Fantastic acting, story was solid enough and it was visually stunning."
" In The Same Vien as Underworld
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,7,"This film definitely carries the classic tropes of dark-and-gritty setting and story, and overdramatized action complete with twirly fight scenes that were popular for its time. One can easily see how his movie ranks among other like the Underworld franchise and Legion, and even has some of the same actors, complete with an element of supernatural, a story of ancient clans in a centuries long war that humans can't see, and ""the chosen one"" that can end the war, and it uses the Frankestien monster as the engine for it. So in that aspect, it's an entertaining enough movie if you like movies like that, despite having a certain hokiness and/or charm to it. CGI and makeup is well done, the plot was somewhat mediocre, but overall it's not a bad movie."
" Better than Most Movies In This Genre!! Critics Are Snobs!!
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,10,"I have no idea why so many people are hating on this movie. This is the best fantasy action film I have seen in a while. Its job was to entertain and it definitely did that. Why does everyone believe a film must have some deep meaning wrapped all in the story line? Sometimes a simple premise (good vs evil), directed properly, is just as entertaining. Really, a lot of these pretentious Masterpieces, bore the heck out of me. I get enough drama and ""Life"" by living in the real world, why do I want to sit around and watch it on the big screen? Just atching a bunch of over-dramatic blah..blah...blah. Relax and learn to just enjoy a good flick with some explosions. You don't have to tell any of your critic buddies. Its OK to like a movie based on your own interests, forget what others think. It's ridiculous that this had so many bad reviews. People have their dang skinny jeans on to tight or something. Sheep take to fads and trends due to their own inability to think for themselves, so they just follow trends and fads and clicks.Just repeated blah blah. This movie rocked! Maybe one day people can just chill, shut-up and watch a fun flick."
" Slightly Better Than Bloodrayne Movie
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,4,"Ugh. Now I know why this movie was so low rated. I generally love movies like this, like Underworld, like Van Helsing, like League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, like Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters. They're not great movies, but they entertain and their plot/dialogue/acting are of decent enough quality to get you engrossed into them.I, Frankenstein is NOT one of those movies.To begin with, the plot is totally out of left field. When I think of Frankenstein's Monster, I think of something along the lines of Penny Dreadful. THAT is a proper plot for Frankenstein. In contrast, this movie's plot makes as much sense as a Dracula movie where the vampire fights aliens from outer space and Bigfoot. W...T...F?!?! Who thought Frankenstein should be fighting this movie's foes?!?!?This movie is just slightly better than Bloodrayne and Dungeons & Dragons. The special effects and acting and dialogue are just one step above that of the latter movies. I've seen episodes of Hercules & Xena that were better all around than this movie. So disappointed."
" Boring
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,3,Got about 40 minutes in and switched to something else.
" Fun action movie
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,8,"I don't know why this gets such bad reviews. I found it very fun, good action and the plot was good as well. Aaron's acting is a little wooden, but he's supposed to be a soulless ""monster"" so it works with this character. Supporting cast is good as well. I also think the demons and the gargoyles look great, I think the cgi is excellent. As long as you don't take it too seriously, this is a fun action flick. Two thumbs up."
" I am a demon prince!
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,1,This movie is God awful in every way. Aaron Eckhart is terrible as the mascara wearing Frankenstein with stitches that disappear and reappear depending on the scene. Terrible cgi. The gargoyles look horrible. Prosthetics are insanely bad. I think someone did this movie on a raspberry pi. The soundtrack is the same throughout the whole hour and a half. Watch the trailer and save your time for something else.
" A blast and fun
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,8,"This is a good movie don't take it to seriously, it is what it is, good dark humour, gothic tones, and udles of action, take it as a bit of fun, this is what this film is, good old rock n roll."
" Ignore the negative reviews
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,8,Not as bad as the negative reviews make it out to be. Different twist on the standard classic horror movie. Don't go in expecting an Oscar worthy movie. Good action movie.
" Secret pleasure
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,8,"I've watched it several times. Fun story, fun special effects, sexy Eckhart, good looking gargoyles, bad guys get it at the end, and some gore but not excessive. What more do you want for an evening on the couch with popcorn? . Don't know why it gets low marks. If you like the Underworld franchise, but not as much gore, watch it. One note, great wardrobe choices for Adam, the Frankenstein monster, and the Gargoyles, but the Gargoyle Queen... surrounded by minions in sexy leather garb....she has the same dress after 200 years, it's ill made (looks like some cheap fabric from Walmart, used for a prom dress), ill fitting, just looking at her makes me itch."
" Such an underated movie. But I loved it.
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,9,This movie is a great idea. And I think it was underated. I personally loved it. I thought it was well acted. And the special effects were quite good. For the time. I think deserved a sequel. Bill Nighy was outstanding as always in the bad guy role. But Arron Eckhart stole the show as Frankensteins monster.
" Popcorn Movie/Cousin of Underworld
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,7,"This is a fun movie to watch with a bowl of popcorn. Definitely has a very strong ""Underworld"" feel to it. Not unusual since a few key people from that series of movies were involved in this one.Many critics will say the plot is thin and it has plot holes That is true. But it has a lot of action and I actually enjoyed Aaron Eckhart as the title character. If you're looking for a no brain action/supernatural adventure movie to watch on a rainy day or late night.....there' s a lot worse choices out there."
" Fun Storytelling
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,9,"Picks up where Shelley leaves off. Digital animation was outstanding. It's particularly important now that Notre Dame is destroyed. I played the scenes with the cathedral over many times, thankful to have a visual representation of the most amazing and beautiful man made creations."
" Sci-Fi, Monsters, lot's of fun.
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,7,"Fun monster action movie with a good fun plot. Gargoyles were used in history at cathedrals supposedly to turn evil spirits away, demons really not sure which then ad Frankentsein to the mix let the chaos and battles begin."
" good action movie
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,4,"Great special effects, good cast. but very little as far as plot. my question is are there not anymore humans than two scientist one cop and a few bar patrons in the whole city? this movie is quite enjoyable but if you're looking for sustenance maybe this isn't for you."
" lame and boring
",2019-06-28 00:00:00,1,"I do not really like these kind of movies and i watched the worst of them all .. the CGI is very bad .. the beginning is the highlighter of the movie it was god to see the origin of the story in this way .. they never really cared about the movie , you could see it in every aspect : the acting - the direction - the plot - the visual effects it was meant for the money only"
" my notes
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,6,Awesome action and beastly scenes. had lots of questionable parts so don't expect a solid story without plot holes but very entertaining overall. very cool idea for a movie. could have had better cgi (1 viewing)
" Badly executed movie
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,3,"I, Frankenstein is a perfect example of how to destroy a good script.It seems that either the main character played by Aaron Eckhart was not made understand the script or he wasn't interested in portraying the character of Frankenstein.The direction is senseless and movie diverts from it's plot many times. The screenplay is also confusing and seems to be perplexed.The Acting was just ok. Overall a badly and disappointing movie."
" ""I am like none other.""
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,7,"After burying his creator, the Frankenstein Monster (Aaron Eckhart) is beset by demons who attempt to lure him to the dark side, while those of the Gargoyle Order representing the Archangel Michael hope to attract him to their position in the fight between good and evil. There's probably no end to the way script writers and film makers can reinterpret the Frankenstein legend, and this flick takes things into the realm of sci-fi/fantasy adventure. When the Gargoyle High Queen Leonore (Miranda Otto) renamed Victor Frankenstein's creation 'Adam', it seemed more than apparent to this viewer that she was referencing God's creation of the First Man. For the Gargoyles, this new Adam had the potential to defeat the insidious forces of Naberius, the Dark Prince (Bill Nighy). For the uninitiated, it's revealed in the story that a demon spirit can only possess a body that has no soul, so that theme resonates throughout, as Naberius looks for a way to reanimate the tens of thousands of corpses he's harvested using the techniques of the original Victor Frankenstein. It's not altogether a bad picture if you go for this stuff, with commendable special effects and some exciting action sequences. As Adam, Aaron Eckhart doesn't have a look that would scare you silly, in fact there's a moment in the film when Naberius's reanimator Terra Wade (Yvonne Strahovski) appears to consider him rather handsome in a rugged, good looks sort of way. But the guy prefers to be a loner, seeing as how he's been tapped to wear the mantle of descender of the demon horde."
" a different take on Frankenstein
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it is a very different take on the classic story of Frankenstein giving the monster much more depth. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Underworld for kids.
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,2,"I hate this movie. With almost every fiber of my being. I'll start with the good parts, because there are almost none.
The CGI fire was impressive at first... for about 30 seconds.That's pretty much it.Lets start with the obvious: a PG rating means no blood, no cuss and limited violence. That pretty much killed any hope this movie could get any of the audience underworld got, where blood, guts, bloody weaponry, insults and violence disguise the relative nothingness of that movie.The story is an attempt to bring the Frankenstein tale to the masses as some kind of fairy tale, with a couple of ingredients in an attempt to add flavor like a love subplot, which adds absolutely nothing, and a self-realisation subplot... which is abandoned and added, of course, absolutely nothing. Every cliché ever used in a movie is used here, so don't expect your braincells to work too much. It was an extremely predictable story, but also it was forced into your face in less than 10 minutes, so you are definitely not able to feel something for the characters or to get interested into the plot. You are not even going to remember their names, I assure you.The actors looked bored and uninterested all the time. Their acting was bad and painfully lazy. Aaron Eckhart looked as if he was just to start crying every time he talked. He was bored to death.The dialog is boring and cliché. The story is boring and cliché. The desitions the characters make are illogical at best. The movie could have been 10 minutes long if they followed the logical route, which is a shame because I would have liked it more.The cinemathography and photography are horrible, everything looks bland even if the appocalypse is coming.My main complain is the use of CGI: It was used so extensibly it actually made the movie an unwatchable mess every time there was a major battle, which was constantly.Speaking of battles, at least those are good, right?
WRONG!
Every battle looks the same. A big panoramic where lots of fire start getting into the land, an occasional beam of light went into heaven, close ups of someone yelling while fire is all around them, rinse and repeat. It was painfully repetitive and lazyIn general, a boring, cliché movie that tried too hard to be underworld without any of the elements that made it interesting to watch.Avoid it at all costs."
" Why the Hate?
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,9,"I, Frankenstein is a different and fun ride that isn't your grandparents grunting, arms stretched out, neck ""battery jumper posts"" monster. I read someone bemoaning Mary Shelley and how she must be horrified by this movie but what this person seems to ignore is the fact the original Frankenstein wasn't what Shelley had in mind and the sequels, Bride of Frankenstein, Frankenstein vs Dracula, etc certainly didn't match her novel at all! The I, Frankenstein is a fast paced, monster(s) vs monsters movie with an amazing storyline, plenty of action and well worth a watch and it's one the kids can watch and will love!I dislike movie critics and rarely have the same opinion on movies, they like flicks that I consider to be worthless bovine feces and I enjoy movies they seem to hate! What I dislike even more are armchair ""critics"" who, for some stupid reason, think their opinions are as relevant and important as the pros. Instead of saying they enjoyed a movie and give reasons why, they have to opine."
" Soulless CGI Monstrosity
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,2,"This must be how Mary Shelley's Victor Frankenstein felt upon the horrifying realization of what he had created. I could've prevented it, too. Nobody forced me to finish ""I, Frankenstein,"" but I let it happen. I cannot destroy it, and like Frankenstein, I can only warn others of the horrors I've witnessed.Turning Gothic-horror literary characters into action heroes is an increasingly tired movie endeavor, and it's likely to only get worse if Universal continues to unveil its rebooted Dark Universe and as studios scramble to piggyback on the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. We've already had ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (2003), ""Van Helsing"" (2004), Dracula in ""Blade: Trinity"" (2004), ""Dracula Untold"" (2014) and this, ""I, Frankenstein."" Most of them have next to nothing to do with their literary traditions, which is the reason I watched this, because I've been seeking out a bunch of Frankenstein films since re-reading the novel. This one glosses over some of the story particulars of Shelley's work, but, of course, it really has nothing to do with the book.That'd be fine, except like, supposedly, Frankenstein's creature, this movie has no soul. Forget the movie's juvenile notions of religion, too--I mean there's nothing intelligent here, nor even a spark of life to grasp hold of. In fact, with a mostly CGI-created environment full of CGI-created gargoyles and demons, there's oft nary a soul on screen. Frequent bird's-eye view shots--or should I say, gargoyle-eye views--show off the artificial environs. It's like Frankenstein's monster: assembled from various dead parts but no lightning bolt to give it life--or electric eels in this case, which is an idea stolen from ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" (1994).The entire bag of bad action-movie clichés are displayed here, too: the grandiose narration explaining the nonsense ad nauseam, the constant overblown score, the ridiculous fighting moves with characters jumping in the air to deliver punches, the stupid slow-mo posturing, bad guys explaining their evil plans when they should be killing the hero, and inane throwaway one-liners (""Descend in pain, Demon."" ""Him, not It."" And, of course, another iteration of ""It's alive!"" from the 1931 ""Frankenstein""). Despite featuring a reanimated corpse with organs and tissue sewn together, the PG-13 violence is bloodless, too. (I would've rated this higher if just once Aaron Eckhart had squealed, ""Fire bad!"" when one of the demons exploded into flames.)Worst of all, this is the best-looking Frankenstein creature ever put on screen. A few stitches and hiding him in shadows the entire movie does not make hunky Eckhart, with his blue eyes, dimpled chin and chiseled features, look ugly. Besides maybe the unusually-young-but-whatever lead scientist (of only a two-scientist team, by the way--do the demons even want to succeed?), he's the most attractive one in the movie, and I was just waiting for the two to hook up. One benefit of this movie's adoption of the overused orange-and-teal color-correction palette, though, is that it makes Eckhart's skin look yellow, which, I'm sure accidentally, is in line with Shelley's description of the creature."
" Terrible
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,1,"Incredibly bad movie has the creation of Frankenstein involved in a war between heaven and hell. Just bad all around, what happened to Aaron Eckhart? Why do a lame movie for this, just for money, I'd imagine. Waste of time."
" Scenario is incredibly lazy
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,3,"I must admit I didn't see trailers or was aware that it was based on the comics before watching the movie.
Usually in this genre (sci-fi, creatures), the story is explained in the beginning and certain rules are established early in the story. As the movie progresses, main protagonists work within their set limits and come up with solutions to whichever problems they face, their self identity, evil force taking over the world etc.
It is formulaic but expected. I was hoping for a bit more (note to self: always watch trailers before the movie!).
Well this movie started like that and... kept on adding some things that were previously not mentioned, every problem has a new inventive solution. The main character 'won' in the end because of something freshly added to the story. Maybe it makes sense to somebody who read the comic. I didn't and because of that, I don't think this movie deserves 5 stars it currently has on imdb.Visually it looks dark and broody, quite similar to Underworld. I wasn't particularly impressed by action scenes, I am generally not a fan of them, so my opinion could be biased. However, in some action scenes, they were cut very fast and unless you are concentrating a lot it will be difficult to notice how somebody died (death of one person was discussed a bit later and I couldn't recall what happened to that person). Maybe that is just me.I can only recommend this to fans of Aaron Eckhart, he looks quite handsome here :) Everybody else, waste of time. 
It is ~ 90 minutes hours long, at least the torture didn't last long!"
" When the Search for Originality Fails
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,3,"Although all of the characters in these monster movies are fictional, when stories are reinterpreted too far from their original story lines they tend to fail. Frankenstien, in the main, was originally concieved as an idea which wrestled with the struggle between the scientific endeavour and the natural order or things, not a story of the battle between demons and angels (gargoyles in this instance). The spiritual element of the minsters quest only touched the original story due to the prominent religious world view of the times. In my view this movies failed and is rated so because it stretches the concept held in our minds beyond it's original narative."
" So very boring and predictable
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,2,"If you didn't watch this movie then you haven't missed out on much. If you watched the first 10 minutes of it you quickly realize how it's going to end. The main character is far from scary or far from a monster and I wish I would stop seeing Bill Nighy in these kind of movies, Underworld was enough but I do really like him as an actor."
" Very different
",2018-06-21 00:00:00,6,Very different action/ sci-fi movie. I was entertained through this movie. I can watch it again and still be entertained. I have a feeling even with the low ratings there will be another one to come out.
" I, Frankenstein is just as soulless as its titular creation.
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,3,"How many times does Hollywood want to rinse Mary Shelley's novel dry? 'Frankenstein', 'Bride of Frankenstein', 'Young Frankenstein', 'Van Helsing' and even 'Frankenweenie'. All the same story but with slight different interpretations. In this fantasy action flick, Frankenstein's monster is in the midst of a war between gargoyles and demons where his master's re-animation methods are sought after by a ""powerful demon"". Do you see that quote on the front cover? ""From the producers of Underworld"", yeah...it's the exact same story. Exactly the same! A supernatural war hidden from humans where the protagonist is on neither side. Let's just call this 'Underworld: Religious Borefest'. Are there any positives? Eckhart, Otto and Nighy give their best with what was given to them I guess. The effects for the ascension and descension of souls kept my eyes occupied for a while. Also the infrequent action scenes weren't filmed badly at all! It's just weighted down by a horrifically uninspired story that takes itself far too seriously which consequently sucks all the fun out of the film. Completely focussed on building lore and backstory that it becomes a detriment to the narrative flow. Immediately it describes this eternal war and how Frankenstein's monster (named Adam by the way...) is soulless...yet I literally couldn't care less. Exposition after exposition after exposition. You cannot make a compelling story without incorporating fulfilling characters. None of them were even partially developed, just tools in assisting the over reliant visual effects driven fight scenes. Speaking of, the gargoyle and demon designs were blander than Eckhart's half dead face. The final showdown that was built up finishes a minute after it commences. Frankenstein's Monster (I refuse to call him Adam) just mopes around bathing in his own cocoon of self depression where Eckhart does his best Batman impression. Worst of all, the final words of the film were ""I...Frankenstein"". Yup, I'm not even joking. Perhaps I, Frankenstein should've stayed dead..."
" I, quite possibly, hate this film.
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,2,"I, who had to sit through this sour-faced and sickeningly stupid slog of a brainless blockbuster, hated every minute of 'I, Frankenstein (2014)'. It's absolute soulless studio schlock from beginning to end, with awful action driven by muddy, nearly unbearably bad CGI actually providing release from its contrived plot that's delivered solely via painful expository dialogue seeming to reside on a nose as long as Pinocchio's. It's really, really bad and boring to boot (a stupid film that's fun is much more forgivable than something as self-serious as this). If it comes on TV, you should avert your eyes. 2/10"
" A frenzied yet dull Underworld clone from the same writer
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,3,"I, Frankenstein: Directed by Stuart Beattie and written by Stuart Beattie and Kevin GreviouxWeek 8: Tomatometer rating for this gem is 4%This week's wonderful offering comes from the creator of the Underworld series, an idea stolen from a mix of sources and made dull and lifeless even by schlocky B movie standards. This is a very similar movie. All you have to do is replace gargoyles(angel stand ins) and demons with vampires and werewolves and replace Romeo and Juliet with Frankenstein and presto change o you have this movie.I hope though you don't go in hoping for some character motivation or development of any kind. It starts with the most basic information about Frankenstein and throws you into a war between two opposing armies. It gives you no more information than that. It is the story of a chosen one, a certain character who can change the course of everything. It hops from one action scene into another with little rhyme or reason. It doesn't really make sense. You have no idea what Bill Nighy's character is doing until the very end. It is a twisted little knot of plot threads. It involves Aaron Eckhart's Adam and him lacking a soul. It is just an excuse for wild and crazy scenes. It moves quickly enough and it doesn't get bogged down in too much. It is a little too serious. The acting is bland all across the board but then again I'm not sure anyone really cared that much when it came to that. The oddest thing about this movie though is they talked about protecting mankind, the gargoyle/angel creatures did anyway but you never see any people. It briefly features an European nightclub with some people and one lone police officer who ventures into a movie set alleyway but after that the city feels completely empty. Where are all the people when this insanely huge massive battle and huge mansion being destroyed with wild explosions are taking place? It makes the reality of the situation feel left out. It loses you from becoming immersed in the world, well that and the terrible gargoyles effects and the goofy kids playing dress up feel of the human version of the gargoyles. I can not recommend this. It fits right in the middle as far as this little experiment goes. It's not painful to watch but it is definitely a whatever movie. I give this movie a D."
" God is not the soul creator of man
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,6,"The film starts out smartly in 1795 with first person narration by the Frankenstein monster himself. After a run in with some demons, Frankenstein opts to head up north and film ""Frankenstein Theory."" The demons that want him are lead by Naberius (Bill Nighy). It seems Naberius' boss is Satan himself, and I don't mean the hockey player. The reason why they want Frankenstein is unclear, but later reveals itself...and how.Since the powers of evil want Mr. F. Stein, so do the powers of good which are gargoyles. They are lead by Leonore (Miranda Otto) who now has elven ears, but too late; Viggo Mortensen isn't in this film. They want Frankenstein who she now names Adam (Aaron Eckhart) because that sounded significant to the script writers who haven't had a brilliant idea yet.The film moves to the current age (pun intended) where Mr. Wessox (Bill Nighy again- wink wink nudge nudge) leads a group of re-animaters (Yvonne Strahovski).The special effects were decent. When demons die they burst into flames like flash powder and nothing around them burns, sort of like CG fire. Indeed, the fighting was the best part of the film because when someone had to read a line, the film died. (pun almost intended). The dialog was simply horrible and the cardboard characters had no sense of humor. The slow scenes were tough to sit through, tempting the average person to go to the theater restroom and enter a different cinema.The kids may like it.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
" An underrated movie
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,9,"In a fantastic world where godly gargoyles fought against the evil demons, each of them disguised as humans and living among them, Frankenstein, the creature, is brought to life by an ingenious scientist. Here, he gets caught in the middle as the demon prince wants to study him in order to create an enormous army. Thus, he must choose which side he's on before humanity gets threatened with extinction.It's a gorgeously animated world, looking impressive from any point of view, in which a large scale war is unraveling. Frankenstein is forced to take action as he becomes the most wanted for the demons, but his soulless nature is going to play a big role in the upcoming future. As I said, it looks astonishing, and although its story isn't, by far, groundbreaking, nor its characters, its action scenes, together with some dramatic ones will definitely create an enjoyable view. I know it's not a flawless movie, but I consider it pretty underrated for what it offers in comparison with what it promised to deliver."
" Another loss of time!
",2017-09-03 00:00:00,2,"Some awkward creatures fight with other creatures, even more awkward. Among them, the creature created from corpses by Victor Frankenstain, Frankenstein, now baptized Adam, much nicer than Boris Karloff. The beautiful monster is Aaron Eckhart. He will interact with the beautiful Yvonne Strahovski (Terra). Everything with the help of Queen Leonore (Miranda Otto), now a woman, in the next second monster. Bill Nighy is a very convincing, very compelling super-villain, very good actor. Successful decorations and costumes, special effects non-stop. But, since the story is just a bad joke, everything is a failure."
" Terrible trailers kept everyone away from a good movie!
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,10,"Everyone I see here who has left scathing reviews are basing them off the horrid marketing and trailers, not the film itself.Frankenstein's monster is used as God's instrument against the forces of hell, a surprising twist to the traditional horror tale. He's constantly proclaiming that he is his own man, but throughout the movie, you see his strange existence is only possible because The Almighty is allowing him to walk the Earth.Lacing in the mythologies of Gargoyles was a brilliant touch -- these are more than 'black-ops angels' and the actors are clearly having a blast in the roles. There is subtlety and nuance at play -- that is, IF you bother to watch the whole movie.The vivid, colorful palette and cinematography was a welcome surprise -- I expected this to be a muted, greens/blues sort of thing, but instead was treated to masterful use of lighting, set design and mood. This may be a popcorn flick, but it's a well crafted and lovely one.The only thing that falls kinda flat, is the score. Kinda forgettable. But if you're paying attention, you won't miss it.I recommend this if you can find it. Well worth a rental or a Halloween Marathon at the cinema."
" Not All That Good
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,4,"Some great casting in this film: Miranda Otto (LotR), Bill Nighy (PotC, Underworld, Harry Potter), Kevin Grevioux (Underworld) but they are all cast in a rather lame Frankenstein film here. The story is rather bad and there is misuse plus over use of CGI.I can forgive terrible special effects but I have problems forgiving a lame story. I really don't know what they were thinking with this one. Sure it's an original story - but just not a good one.Angels that are Gargoyles?! Demons after Frankenstein's Monster aka Adam. Demons planning to launch a war on humans (killing and enslaving them) while Frankenstein's Monster, Adam, is sorta in a ""superhero"" role - an Anti-Hero I guess he's suppose to be in this film.Points for trying to come up with a new story - something different - but it's not very good and I hate to say that. The film only semi holds my attention.I won't complain to bad, it came in a film pack. lol.4/10"
" My french point of view
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,3,I just saw the movie and it s so far from the shelley book. Aaron remains handsome although he has scars but that s the only interesting point. Was it necessary to add vampires and creatures of evil. Mary Shelley wanted to underline the loneliness of the creature and to explain about difference. The movie seems to talk about Buffy and the vampires.

",2017-03-15 00:00:00,5,"I, Frankenstein is so absurd it's like some mind bending hallucinogenic trip. To be fair it's not so bad that you have to switch it off in sheer bewilderment or disgust but it's not a fat lot of good either. It's strangely fascinating due to the sheer insanity of it all.Aaron Eckhart is pretty good as the creature, Bill Nighy just turns up as Viktor from the Underworld films again, Yvonne Strahovski is just there to look pretty and Miranda Otto is so po-faced and earnest every time she appears it's hilarious.Speaking of hilarious, there are a lot of guffaws to be found here. I couldn't believe what I was witnessing most of the time. ""The Gargoyle Order"". A massive city being destroyed in the name of a secret war between God and Satan that has remained secret from humans (yes really) for centuries yet there is never anyone on the streets. The entire population must down a copious amount of sleeping pills as soon as the moon appears and lie in oblivion until sunset. One of the main supporting characters is played by a soap actress from Neighbours. The gargoyles look decent but the demons, oh man, those face masks are laughable, like something from a crappy 80's B-Movie, and the fact they all fight while wearing black designer suits just made it all the more absurd and hilarious.It's worth watching for a few giggles, it's so unintentionally funny in parts it gives Young Frankenstein a run for its money! But don't expect anything of worth, this is no Boris Karloff's Frankenstein or Bride Of Frankenstein in any shape or form."
" You're only a monster if you behave like one.
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,6,"Aaron Eckhart is cast as Frankensteins' Monster in this elaborate but so-so screen adaptation of the graphic novel created by Kevin Grevioux. (Grevioux also co-stars, as an imposing henchman named Dekar.) After the deaths of both Elizabeth and Victor F., The Monster is soon attacked by Demons. He learns that there's been a war waging for centuries, between Gargoyles (the good guys) and these aforementioned Demons (the baddies). The Monster also learns that there's a head Demon named Naberius (Bill Nighy) who wants to learn Victors' big secrets of creating life. He / it tries to live a solitary existence, but realizes that he WILL have to get involved in this war.I'll join the chorus of people who attempt to defend this movie, at least to some degree. Yeah, it's cut from the same cloth as a lot of other modern horror / fantasy / action hybrids such as the ""Underworld"" series. It doesn't tell a particularly innovative or interesting story, but it is at least an entertaining one. Enough so that this viewer wasn't constantly checking his watch, anyway. It features a truly over the top Gothic look, and some passable makeup, but some viewers will surely be turned off by the plethora of digital effects.Eckhart leads the way, and does a creditable job, delivering a performance of both intensity and physicality. Filmed in Australia, much of its cast are native Aussies, and they do bring a certain gravitas to the material. Nighy has had better material, to be sure, but he's a perfectly suitable lead villain here. Yvonne Strahovski (as Terra Wade, a scientist in Naberius' employ), Miranda Otto (as the Gargoyle Queen), and Caitlin Stasey (as Keziah the warrior) are all extremely easy on the eyes, which doesn't hurt any. It's nice, as it always is, to see Bruce Spence of ""The Road Warrior"" fame, on screen; that face of his is instantly recognizable.""I, Frankenstein"" is slick, and forgettable, but not an entirely empty experience, as it does have some humanity and sense of purpose.Six out of 10."
" Aaron Eckhart can't save this soulless rendition of the classic literary figure
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,4,"It is difficult to count how many times Mary Shelley's classic horror tale has been clapped with a cinematic adaptation, with the first treatment dating back to the silent film era. Since the early age of Hollywood, it's been hard to remember the last time classic monsters from literature such as Dracula, Frankenstein, or The Mummy have been met with a competent, if not masterly adaptation. While Hollywood has tried many times to capture the life and spirit of the classic literary works, very few times, if any have prevailed on this accomplishment. This fantasy action piece directed by Stuart Beattie (most notable as the writer of 2004's 'Collateral') fails certainly does no justice. This film is taken from the pages of the graphical novel of the same name written by Kevin Grevioux as Beattie pursues a compelling fantasy-action tale. But his effort come to feeble results. Opening in the late 18th century, this film stars Aaron Eckhart as the titular creature created by the famous Victor Frankenstein (played by Aden Young). Upon murdering Victor's wife and leaving his creator for dead, Frankenstein is taken in by a league of gargoyles lead by the Queen Leonore (played by Miranda Otto) who names him ""Adam"" and vows to protect him. When he flees his hometown and into a modern society 200 years later, he finds himself drawn into an all-out war between the gargoyles and a clan demon lead by the evil Naberius (played by Bill Nighy). And the only help on his side is an electrophysiology scientist Terra Wade (played by Yvonne Strahovski).If you seen this film such as 'Erin Brockovich', 'Olympus Has Fallen', and 'The Dark Knight', you have experienced alluring talent of Aaron Eckhart. Aaron Eckhart is not bad here, his performance stands solid in the lead role as well as the supporting cast in their respective roles. Unfortunately, the performances only make up half of the equation and fail to redeem how dull and uninteresting the characters are. Aaron Eckhart's lead character Adam not only falls victim to dreary character development but lacks both the charisma and compulsion to make for a character you come to care about. And the supporting character along his side amount to nothing but one-dimensional figures including the main villain Naberius who's supposed to make for the most interesting aspect of the plot along with the lead character. But with a sorely uninspiring script, the film not fails to generate any interesting characters but traps these characters in a plot that begins with a compelling premise, but eventually slogs down to a generic drudgery. The story introduces a massive war against the gargoyles and the demons which was destined transpire to something more interesting. Sadly, the plot never reaches any dynamic heights. The most excitement the film has to offer maybe the fantasy-esque battles between the gargoyles and demons as the latter explodes into a puff of CGI fire and ash upon impalement. And of course, it is hard not to spare credit to the nifty production design of the Victorian Era temple where the gargoyles reside. It's only too bad that the writing fails to level up with the visual compulsion.I, Frankenstein is a lifeless rendition of the classic Victoria-era monster with performances by a stellar cast who take strong advantage of their acting talent, but fail to make up for the uninspiring drivel this film is. Even if director Scott Beattie shows strength in visual heft, his efforts on bringing the world of Frankenstein to life come without prevail."
" ""I, Frankenstein""- An occasionally entertaining but generally vapid fantasy-adventure.
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,4,"Perhaps the most perplexing thing about trying to write a review for writer/director Stuart Beattie's comic-book adaptation ""I, Frankenstein"" is the simple fact... there's really not much to say about this film. Neither awful enough to be completely dismissed, nor good enough to be a worthwhile consideration for viewing, the film just sort-of sits in a limbo of mere ""existence."" It's a movie that happened, but not one that really matters in any stretch of the imagination. Perhaps good for a laugh or two should you catch it on cable, but not one you'll likely remember even seeing a few days later. Which actually is a shame, especially coming from the same creative minds that brought us films like ""Collateral"" and the somewhat overblown but pretty decent ""Underworld"" franchise.Aaron Eckhart plays an overly-hunky rendition of Frankenstein's monster, who not long after the conclusion of the events depicted in the original Mary Shelley classic, finds himself attacked by demonic forces. However, he is saved by gargoyle warriors created by the archangel Michael to protect the Earth from demons. The warriors dub Frankenstein's monster ""Adam"", and offer to let him join them as a warrior for heaven, but he declines, choosing to live alone. Centuries later, in the modern day, Adam continues to fend off these vile creatures. Soon enough it becomes clear that a demon-prince called Naberius (Bill Nighy) is seeking him to learn Victor Frankenstein's secret to creating life... a secret he wants for his own dark purposes. And so, Adam must form an uneasy alliance with the gargoyles in order to stop Naberius' wretched plans and to save the world from the forces of darkness...To be fair, there are a few elements at play that do work, and I think that's why I cannot completely disregard the film. Eckhart, probably best known now for his turn as Harvey Dent in Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" makes for an adequate hero, and I actually enjoyed his performance. Even though he's been made into just a stock ""brooding hero"", Eckhart gives the role just enough of an emotional core and does well with what little material he has. He makes for a good Frankenstein's monster turned action hero. It just drives me nuts that they tried to ""pretty him up"", and he's simply just regular old handsome Aarson Eckhart with a few faded scars around his face. I think it would have added a lot if they made him a bit more grotesque. And as always, Bill Nighy is an absolute joy as our lead adversary. He's never anything less than stellar, and he'll give his all to even the most silly of roles. So I really enjoyed his turn as a demonic prince... it gives him some fun moments to sink his teeth into. Director Stuart Beattie also has a knack for visuals and even if the film is heavily reliant on big, loud CG effects, I could never call the visual guidance anything less than slick. At its best, the film does have the ability to entertain, and there's a few stand-out sequences where the action rings true and you'll find yourself somewhat thrilled with the proceedings.But unfortunately, it's the script that does the film in, in a big, bad way. Based on a graphic novel by ""Underworld"" co-creator Kevin Grevioux, Beattie's script is just a complete mess. There's absolutely no breathing room for anything outside of the most basic of character and story development, as it rockets by with an almost nonsensical pacing. Interesting ideas are brought up and then dropped on a near-constant basis. (Ex. Wouldn't it have been interesting to have gotten more than a fleeting glimpse of the multi-century jump in time the film takes after it's prologue? I wanna see how Adam managed to get by as time went on.) And it just plays the relatively insane-o concept of Frankenstein's monster trapped in a war between immortal factions a bit too seriously. Sure, play the actual plot-line straight, but the film needed a few more laughs and moments of levity. The trend of taking old stories and giving them gritty, modern reboots seems to work best in situations like ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"", where the concept is played for both thrills and for laughs. And I think this film definitely needed some lighter moments to help make the concept more digestible.As it stands, ""I, Frankenstein"" just sits as a relatively middling and mediocre take on the iconic character. True, the film boasts some fun performances, a handful of thrilling action set-pieces and slick direction... but its all at the service of some of the most bland and tragically misguided writing I've seen in recent memory. A script with a haphazard pace, lack of development and bizarrely over-serious tone really drags down what could otherwise have been a fun little adventure romp. In the end, we may not get the worst movie ever made. But we get something that is arguably far worse- a film that is completely and utterly unremarkable and thoroughly forgettable. This is one of those rare films where I actually hope it gets the reboot treatment sooner rather than later, and that they take some more risks with the material... give it slight sense of self-aware humor to compensate for the ridiculous concept, slow down the pacing to give it some breathing room and explore the character of Adam a bit more, and you'll have a very fun movie. Instead of a bland one like this.I give ""I, Frankenstein"" a sub-par but watchable 4 out of 10. If you can see it for free, I'd say consider giving it a shot. It's the sort-of movie that would make for good background noise on a slow day while you do other things. But that's about it."
