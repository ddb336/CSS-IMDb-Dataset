" Fantastic movie, want more
",2021-04-01 00:00:00,7,"Like others have said, this was just a pilot for a TV series. Such a shame. This was a really cool plot idea and very well done! I want more. I want a TV series, a sequel or even a book series. Just so many unanswered questions. Oh well."
" Great idea. Great start. But then it just stops.
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,6,You cannot just end a movie like that. Is this supposed to be a tv show pilot that was turned into a movie with no changes to the script?
" 1/10 BECAUSE IT IS NOT A MOVIE BUT A PILOT OF A NEVER STARTED SERIE
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,1,"If it was the first episode of a new serie, i would rate it 8/10 an say that i'm looking forward to watch the rest of it. But it is not, it is out as a stand alone movie, which makes it a complete waste of time. A movie with no ending and absolutely nothing from the plot explained."
" Make it a series!!!
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this so much but it only felt like a prologue, things were just getting started and then... it ended. Mind you, when I watched this I didn't know it was a pilot episode for a series, I only searched it after because the ending (as for a movie) was so unsatisfying.
I really love the concept though. I want more of it! A lot of people compare it to Sliders. Guess in the meantime (while waiting and hoping for Parallels to become a series) I will give it a go."
" Fresh and unique concept but hurried, incomplete ending
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,6,"Was having no expectations when I decided to watch the movie but it caught me by surprise. The concept is really fresh. Cast of the movie is good but not great.Was hooked to the story for the most of the time. Ending was really disappointing as there was hurried explanations and it looked like we are watching a series and the story will move forward in the next episode.Frankly this doesnt looked like a movie to me, it was basically a extended pilot."
" Pretty bad
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,3,"Sub-par acting, plot, well everything about it. What was supposed to be a pilot for a series-turned movie. I'm a fan of these types of movies however who thought it was wise to green light this? Like seriously bad. Don't waste even a dollar on this movie."
" Very Disappointing, pilot for show that has no ending
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,2,"Awesome concept but terrible execution. It was originally made as a pilot for a TV show and now it is just 1 hour and 23 minutes of set-up with 0 conclusion. What a waste, do not spend time on it."
" Typical Garbage, wasted 90 minutes of my life!
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,1,"Why there is even rating for this is beyond me. Weak acting, horrible directing and obviously pre film school wannabees.Avoid!"
" Awesome
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,10,Hopefully part 2 will coming soon please#Philippines
" Original but pointless and incomplete
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,2,"It is the first time i was curious by a description, and the whole concept made me even more thrilled but after a few minutes movie became pointless and incomplete in terms of explanation and goal as a time related movie or a multiuniverse movie if you wish... characters were not likeable. Forgettable execution."
" A Great Concept...That Did Not Achieve It's Full Potential
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,7,"This movie was a good movie. Very well done, especially for an independent movie that was probably done on a fairly tight budget. The acting is good. The camera work is good. The CGI is good. The writing is good...Everything is good. But this movie could have been great. Really great. It fell short of its full potential. Because of the fact that they only explore 2 possible worlds in the movie. 2! Why the hell would you create a movie based on the concept of parallel universes only to explore 2 of them? So that was a bit disappointing. But otherwise its good. And maybe there will be a part 2."
" A movie with no climax
",2019-12-06 00:00:00,8,"If you're watching this treating it like a movie, my suggestion is don't watch.
This was supposed to be series, but somehow it didn't go through so they turned the pilot into the movie.
You can watch it for just simple timepass, but i must tell you this movie will leave you hanging and end up cursing the producers."
" Terrible ending
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,3,"It was looking for good then it came to an abrupt end.
Don't bother watching it as the ending is terrible."
" It's a TV Pilot
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,7,"Not a traditional review but advice. I recommend this be watched as a TV pilot and not a movie because that's exactly what this was. Judging this as a stand alone film would make you rate it very low, but if you watch it with the idea that this was made to be marketed to some tv execs to be made in to a potential tv series later it makes much more sense. This way you'll enjoy it more and rate it higher.The plot is pretty good. I could see this become a pretty damn good sci fi series. The actors however lack skill, and the dialogue could use a lot of improvement."
" What a shame
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,7,"Enjoyed this series pilot. It's a shame, 5 years on, that they haven't created the series. Had lots of potential as a series, as a movie, not so much, however, watchable - you will be disappointed by the end that there's no more."
" open end movie
",2019-09-24 00:00:00,6,I was enjoying it but the end is very bad it actually doesn't explain anything or answer the questions inside the movie and you finally find yourself wasting your time by watching it
" Stupid as it gets
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,1,I can't believe how stupid these characters are. I just can't handle the series of stupid ideas these people have. Nothing makes sense. I absolutely hate it. If you watch this you will understand how frustrating these characters are. They do everything that absolutely no fool would consider. Its hard to express the level of stupidity without spoilers so see for yourself if you wanna know how stupid characters can potentially be.
" Too Bad It Wasn't Released as A Television Series
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,7,"13 September 2015. This is a quite frustrating movie because it's obviously not a movie but a pilot episode for a television series. What's striking about this movie is that is has much more in common with such television series as Lost in Space (1965), Sliders (1995), The Lost Room (2006), and Fringe (2008). The basic sci fi theme is great and refreshing but the actors are also let down by a script that contains lame dialogue and clich√© character quirks and behavior. Unfortunately The Lost in Space presentation as corny as it was, was even better than Parallels at its handling consistency in intelligent thought and behavior. Overall, this movie doesn't really end and is irritating in a good way in that it presented a promise of how fantastic this series could have been."
" Terrible,not even finished! AVOID AT ALL COSTS
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,1,"AVOID AVOID AVOID keep your sanity, as the ""ending"" will annoy you.Not even worthy of 1 star because of how they chose to leave it, but you have to rate it to review it.I love mystery films but this takes the cake. It had great potential, cool story with plenty of ways to take it but instead it falls flat, due to a poor ""ending""....if that's what you call it.The ONLY way to redeem this ""movie"" is to either remake it/ make a part 2 to finish it properly or use the same cast and continue in tv series format.If non of that is done, then it's rather pointless and torturous for the viewer, as in total, it leaves more questions than it answers.Triangle/ Coherence/ Synchronicity/ ARQ are far far far better movies."
" Dull
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,6,"There is not much excitement in the film. The story is pretty generic, probably due to the poor acting of all characters which gives a dull viewing experience. Except for some pretty nice sci-fi effects, nothing stands out in this movie to make it memorable."
" Great concept, sorry to see FOX didn't pick this one up.
",2017-12-05 00:00:00,10,"This is really a great concept, not as cheesy as Sliders, but along the same lines. I liked the actors, and script, although the dialogue seemed a little weak at times. I'll never understand how stuff like this get's axed, but other absolute crap is made into a series. I hope by adding a 10 to this enough people will pay attention that maybe we'll get the rest of the story. It really leaves you with a cliff hanger that may never get answered."
" Great Plot, crappy movie
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,1,"Nice pilot and concept with VERY POOR acting performances and almost worst sequence and logic during the development of the movie, thank god this people didn't get to end the story... maybe later someone with a real cast and some cinematography sense can make something good out of the plot"
" Refreshing B-Movie
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,7,"I never watch series, and it never came to my mind that this was supposed to be a pilot film. The final open end, which I rather found funny and I wasn't disappointed at all, suggested that the story had a lot of potential, and I looked for a (planned) sequel. There is none, no series either.I was entertained without a bore, though the characters were a bit too caricatured, but there wasn't too much unnecessary small talk (which I really hate in series and the reason why I don't waste my time watching them) just to fill the time between a too scarce story events.There isn't much of a story, and you almost feel in a kind of survival 3D game with no monsters. Except there isn't much action either. Nevertheless, I was surprised it took me 40th minutes to check my watch, when it felt just like 20 min. and the rest of the movie ended up quite fast.As it stands, its a good B movie, small budget, cheap effects, but professionally well directed with good rhythm."
