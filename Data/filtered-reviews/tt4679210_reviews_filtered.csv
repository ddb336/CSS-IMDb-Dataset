",2021-01-25 00:00:00,10,I've watched this movie for over 300 times.... Not kidding nd it's worth it... This movie has made a great impact in my life...
" What is wrong with Malayalam movies nowadays!?!
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,3,"Despites what so many of the reviews say, this is an honest one. This movie had no capturing storyline.
The only thing that happens in the movies is hoe the main actor finds himself a new girl after ALL the girls he likes somehow end up gone. And the fact that that is the most interesting part of the movies says it all, this movie sucks!
My piece of advice, dont waste your time watching this movie, its highly overrated and doesn't live up to the hype."

" Love is beautiful.
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,8,"A simple film with the beautiful background of kerala were the film sets, not a big star cast but everyone have done role very well and in special mention Nivin and Sai pallavi pair will relate our life and makes us to learn what is love and how beautiful is it, So watch this film with your soulmate or this movie will make you to search for one soulmate.
In simple Premam is Love, pure love, watch it.."
" A complete visual retreat
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,8,"A path breaking journey of a man to find his true love which goes through several heartbreaking moments. The sweetness of the performances by each and every person is the main highlight especially by Nivin Pauly, Sai Pallavi and Madona Sebastian. Secondly, the execution is highly appreciable which had gone at the top notch level. The movie is a visual retreat with some of the best natural and close up shots especially, during the admiring scene. I personally loved the idea and would highly recommend it. Do give it a watch."
" Most satisfied Love story ever
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,10,"Most satisfied Love story ever, I never excepted this type of story"
" Most romantic movie from South
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,10,I have seen many romantic movies from India. undoubtedly Premam is the greatest romantic movie ever made.
" Poor story line..
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,3,Don't understand who gave 8 rating to this movie.. can't give more than 3 ..sorry
" The perfect romantic film
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Well, nothing much to say.
This movie is a gem.
Scores a 10/10 in every department."
" Path breaking movie in Malayalam cinema
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,9,"Preman 2015 Malayalam movie directed by Alphonse Puthran staring Nivin Pauly, Sai Pallavi, Madona, Anupam was a Trend setting blockbuster on its releasing time. even after all these years its its of the best movies made in a romantic comedy genre. Truly premam is a one of a kind masterpiece film."
" A fun movie to watch
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,7,"It was a really nice movie to watch but not hands down amazing or anything, so don't expect too much. It was simple but beautiful in its simplicity. Nivin Pauly is one of my favourite Malayalam actors and it goes to show in this movie as his versatility in his acting style is superb. The songs were cute, too. Overall, this movie was good but not really my cup of tea. It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen and it's not a movie I'd watch again, but it was definitely fun to watch the first time round."
" ""Highly Overrated""
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,1,"Nearly wasted my 3 hours. I don't understand even now why people're geeting hyper after watching this film. Only for attractive smile of 'Sai Pallavi' & 'Anupama' or for Nivin only? What kind of story is it? Don't know! But I guess acting & attractive dance of Pllavi made them hyper. No lessons from this movie. Moreover it can misguide & excitws youngs to fall in love with cute & attractive teachers; How funny! How can a teacher tolerate such a guy? Isn't it funny practically?
First one hour was really very boring & unbearable for me. It deserves 4 stars or may be less from me. But as it is overrated I'm giving it only 1.
Before watching any movie I check imdb rating. But these types of occurances indicating me not to depend only on IMDB!
If you're 'yo yo' & over romantic type film seeker you can go through it. But if you're fresh art film seeker please don't waste your time!"
" Heart touching and became a fan of (Malar)Sai pallavi
",2019-11-07 00:00:00,10,"I've watched so many films but this movie is quite different and unique.Amazing writing, Direction, Cinematography and wonderful acting no doubt.This is the quality of an Indian cinema and everyone should watch this movie once.Everything is so good, emotional and mesmerizing.I do not know Malayalam language but didn't feel a language barrier for a single moment.I watched this movie twice but still this movie makes me feel different.Sai Pallavi will definitely become a super star one day.She did a wonderful acting in this.Must watch movieKudos to the whole team of this movie."
" Superb flim

" Overrated af
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,1,"One of the most overrated movies of this generation, it's just old wine in a new bottle. The music and cinematography is excellent though."
" Must watch!!
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,10,"Who want to start watching Malayalam movie for the first time, he/she should start with this. He/she will be just fan of malayalm movie"
" A breath of fresh air
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,9,Love stories get very typical. So when saw Premam as recommended DVD I did not think twice. Since I dont understand Malyalam I prefer buying the DVD and watching with the subtitles.This was the first Nivin Pauly film I saw and became a huge fan of him. The transition his character goes through in the film is remarkable. When the film began I had no clue where it was headed. Just when I thought it was going to be a typical love story there was a twist and the leap.All the cast has done good job. And this was Sai Pallavi's first film. She really is a very talented actor and I have since watched her couple of films. But Nivin Pauly is too good in this film. I wonder why this film is not dubbed in Hindi and released all over. Special word for the music. Malare is in my playlist after the film and I just love the song. The sad version too. The guitar and violin piece when Nivin is visiting to see Sai Pallavi is the best background I have heard in recent times.
" Combination of Love & Fun
",2018-10-01 00:00:00,9,I watched this movie through subtitle as i am from Bangladesh and don't understand malaylam language. But i never felt bored. I enjoyed it. Story is good acting was perfect. A combination of love & life.
" Worthwhile
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,8,"Premam is surely Alphonse Puthren's best movie to date and another title to be listed among the top malayalam romance/drama movies of all time. Set in the typical semi-rural backdrop of Kerala, the movie focuses on the struggling and often disappointing love life of George David a malayali teenager wonderfully portrayed by Nivin Pauly and his two loyal best friendsThis movie has taken a completely unique and unexpected route to frame romance and is certainly not a typical rom-com with a very happy ending (The ending is actually bitter-sweet if I put it correctly but different people may have different perceptions).If you watch this movie with both eyes seeking entertainment you may find disappointment. It's plot is its essence. You won't even feel that you have just completed a two hour long rollercoaster ride filled with emotions.The songs are nice (not exceptional) and fit into the story perfectly. Everyone in the cast did a very good job in making this movie worthwhile especially Vinay Forrt who did a great job playing the computer science teacher adding a flavour of comedy to this film.To put it simply this movie is a great one time watch.RATINGS-1) Direction - 8.6/10
2) Cast - 8.3/10
3) Screenplay - 8.5/10
4) Entertainment - 7/10
5) Plot - 8.9/10
6) Songs - 8/10AVERAGE RATING - 8.22/10"
" premam
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,10,"Premam not a movie, is my life. everyone must see this movie."
" premam 2015 is a another feelings of love
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,10,Premam 2015 is a best movie for our life. i have saved this movie in my brain. i have dont forget this movie my full life.
" Alphonse Puthren..what a beauty..
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,10,"I have watched so many many movies throughout my life, some movies I could categorize as great cinematography, outstanding acting, brilliant scripts, superb story telling, spellbinding background score, etc..However there are only a handful which have rattled my emotions while belonging to all above categorizations. ""Premam"" by Alphonse Puthren stands on top of that list as it conquers the perfection of movie making.Got to know about the movie through a friend of mine and I had high hopes for it. Well,my hopes were satisfied although can say whoaaa...did not expect that coming. Premam redefined my view on movies made in India as mainstream Bollywood/kollywood movies have hardly quenched the thirst for brilliance. (Except for ""Aamir Khan"" productions.) Covering breathtaking topography in Kerala district, the movie maintains its own rhythm with well developed characters. Performance by actors have simply took it to the greatness as every single actor gives their role the utmost justice. Must say ""Sai Pallavi"" did steal the prize among the cast, as she portraits her well crafted character with sound dialogues and expressions.Music in ""Premam"" is mesmerizing. Rajesh Murugesan has delivered his best with an amazing background score/soundtracks which will stick in your mind for a long time. Im truly grateful for the director. He surely knows how to arrange all these talents to present us the optimized result and all I can do is writing these words on IMDb to convey my thanks.The movie may have gotten closer to me as the culture and people somewhat resembles my country(Sri Lanka)though nothing can replace its originality. Has a running time of 2.30 hrs, hence make sure to have a peace of mind prior to watch this movie. Im truly sad that I have missed it on big screen still being viewed the blue-ray version.Fingers are crossed for the next masterpiece by Putheran..."
" Georges journey of ...perhaps love!
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a master stroke when it comes to love stories.Loved everything about the movie from settings, lighting, angles , reflection and camera movements. Natural beauty of every character not just the leads was captured perfectly. The grace and gentleness depicted of leading females . Mary's teenage charm, Malar's poise and Celine's modern yet gravitated personality just brilliant. Character of Malar lives in our hearts forever. Nivin Pauly one sparkling talent!"
" Film of Love,Feelings & Emotions
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,10,"A big thanks to director Alphonse Puthren.I watched this movie after the 1 1/2 year.Melodious Music by Rajesh Murugesan and Lyrics by Shabareesh Varma.Shabareesh Varma also played an excellent role in the movie as Shambu.Background Score by rajesh Murugesan is ultimate.I cannot understand the Malayalam,but even i watch this movie daily.Debutant Actors Anupama Parameshwaran,Sai pallavi, Madonna Sebstaian acted very well. The Bgm score in the final part is fabulous.Cinematography is excellent. The actor Nivin Pauly done a great job for his role.The comedy is excellent.Vinay Forte acted very well. So it is not film, its a film of feelings,love and emotions"
" The Best Of Malayalam Cinema
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,10,No Doubts. Premam Is One Of The Best From The Malayalam Cinema. I Have Watched Only 2 Malayalam Movies Yet One 1983 Starring Nivin Pauly And Second This Premam. Nivin Pauly Is The Finest Actor Of The Malayalam Cinema. He is The Only One Who Can Take Malayalam Cinema To The Next Level And Can Compete With Bollywood And No Doubt Malayalam Cinema Is Far Better Than The Other Religious Cinemas. Hope To See Other Love Stories Like This From Nivin Pauly And From Rest Of The Malayalam Cinema. The Movie Was Also Remaked In Telugu Which I Don't Suggest You But If You Watch Telugu Movies You Can Go For It. Otherwise Watch Only Original Stuffs Not Remakes.
