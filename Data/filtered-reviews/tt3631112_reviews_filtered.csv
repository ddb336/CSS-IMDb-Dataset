" Gripping but...
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,7,Really loved the film but the accents! Emily Blunt is an excellent actress who can't do an American accents and the same goes for Luke Evans who i also like. Shame as it affects the immersion.
" A feminist wet dream.
",2021-04-06 00:00:00,3,"Annoying drunk tells an uninterested world about how much her life sucks.The added excruciatingly twist of the ambiguous location is an overpowering distraction. Is it England? Is it America?Incredibly, we're supposed to be sympathetic to the selfish, noisy drunk and the real devil is (have you guessed yet?) a man!Added to the pain is the terrible, cartoon acting of whoever plays drunk Emily.It's pretty dire... unless you're a manhating and self absorbed woman."
" It got better and better as it went on
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,8,"Ok, I'll start by saying I have not read the book so this quick review is based on it being a stand alone film and not the fact it's an adaptation.I have to say I really enjoyed this film on the whole. First 30/45 minutes or so, I wasn't so much. There was no real direction to the plot and the editing was extremely jumpy, so I was finding it quite hard to figure out what's going on. But do not be put off by this, because the story becomes so much more and you are hooked on the edge of your seat wanting to know what's going to happen next. The twist I thought was brilliant as well, genuinely had no idea that would happen.Acting as well I thought was outstanding, Emily Blunt was absolutely unreal. Sold her performance so well.Other than the beginning of the film, another negative I'd like to mention was character depth. I feel the director should have done a better job of this. There was a distinct lack of it, especially when it came to the other main characters of the group. When this is the case I find it quite hard to feel emotion to them, since I don't ""know them"" well enough.Overall though it's well worth a watch. It's an interesting plot with a great twist to the story and partnered with fantastic acting. 8/10 from me personally!"
" Superb acting of emily blunt
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,9,First time iam adding a review on any movie. But after watching the movie i must have to say that what an acting of emily blunt
" Good but lacks the main points of the book
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,8,"The film overall brings the book to life and is an enjoyable watch, apart from Rebecca Ferguson's (Anna) patchy American accent, only downfalls beside accents is some parts of the book are missing if you have read the book but overall it's a solid 8/10"
" Hated the heroine
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,2,"This was so irritating go watch. I couldn't root for the main character, she was just so annoying and pathetic. What does she care if her ex husband is cheating on his current wife! They're broken up!
They had no kids together. She can walk away with no strings attached whatsover! But instead she decides to stalk him, his new wife, his babysitter, his babysitters husband. She rides the train to nowhere everyday to watch them make love with their lights on and curtains open. Who really does that?
If this women found herself a little hobby like knitting or embroidery then she wouldn't have time for this nonsense!"
" Blakey
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,10,Wonderfully made spinoff of the tv show on the busses
" One hell of a ride!
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,9,"It took me a while to get to this movie because I've read some really bad reviews. I can't speak for the book cause I haven't read it (yet) and it is my understanding that those who read it were disappointed with the adaptation but as someone who hasn't I can't figure out why. This was an excellent movie with outstanding performances by all the cast, especially by Emily Blunt. I really enjoyed this ride (see what I did there? Lol) and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a good thriller. Thumbs up!"
" DREARY FILM
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,4,This movie was too long and dreary and not smooth at all.It was very jerky and cumbersome and as a result was not enjoyable.
" Just watched it .. and it blew me away
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,9,"I had no idea what this was about .. i just wanted to watch ""some"" afternoon movie while doing some housework .. aaaand .. i got stuck in front of the screen.While it was very limited in scope (very view locations, limited cast and no fancy effects of course) - the story itself, the flow of things was just so very good.Every character is well portrait and while there is quite a large bit of ""deus ex machina"" to conclude .. it did not feel cheap - mostly due to the very good acting.What can i say? .. i really liked it and i can 100% recommend watching it."
" Sometimes we define ourselves through the eye of someone near to us
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,7,"What worked:
I think the movie is an interesting watch considering the twists and turns that the movie takes throughout its run time. The lead characters are interesting as well and they have some grey areas in their portrayal. Overall, it's an enjoyable watch if you are up for something less stimulating but with a content that burns slow but keeps its moments intactWhat did not work:
I have not read the novel but the way movie worked out, I think the novel should have been a great read. I think the movie is a glorified version of the novel. I think the movie is average in every aspect making it an average movie to watch. I don't want to bring it up but the movie objectifies sexuality literally and I don't know if the novel has the same theme as well.
Final verdict: a popcorn movie"
" Good time pass
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,7,"Interesting Story and suspence. The train was amazing, one can watch watch each and every thing in the road side houses. 😂🤣😂"
" Dull and devoid of tension
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,4,"The premise of this film sounded interesting and could have very well been a captivating thriller but sadly the execution is disappointingThe Girl on the Train follows Rachel, a divorcee struggling with alcoholism who takes the train everyday and looks at people's lives through the window. One day she notices something shocking that leads her down a dark path.This film had so much potential to be great. The overall cast and stpry was intriguing but it managed to end up being a dull thriller devoid of any tension. The saving grace for this film are the performances. Emily Blunt delivers a strong performance of a woman dealing with alcoholism. There's a great amount of subtlety in her performance that made her character interesting and she really carried the film. Rebecca Ferguson, Haley Bennett, Allison Janney and Luke Evans were all pretty good in their roles as well but the script lets them down. There is simply not enough development given to these characters for me to really care about them. I also feel mixed on the dialogues. At times they were great and times where they were awful. The film was way too short considering the amount of characters and perspectives it was following. It should have been much more longer as there would be more time to develop the characters and therefore the themes as a whole.I did like the dark colour palette of the film as it felt suitable for the dark tone of the story. Tate Taylor's direction was not up to the mark. A thriller should be suspenseful and have tension throughout but this film had none of that. In fact it was pretty boring. Taylor made odd choices such as shooting scenes at a low frame rate. I don't understand the purpose behind that choice and it didn't feel fitting for the film. I think someone like David Fincher could have easily elevated this film, its tension and characters considering his impressive work on Gone Girl.The Girl on the Train was a disappointment. I can see an intense thriller made from this but what we got instead was a dull and flat thriller that's honestly quite forgettable."
" Too many twists made movie too unrealistic
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,2,"The script writer seems to be very much influenced by Karamchand and CID serials. So too many twists making story very confusing and unreliable.Another problem with this movie is songs are all in punjabi not hindi. Had the makers had dialogs also in Punjabi, I would have been spared from the pain of watching this movie."
" Love movie
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,10,Who killed Nusrat? This story is about a lawyer and how she got trapped due to her alcoholism and extreme behaviors
" Good movie
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,10,The story is super powerful and the climax was something I never expected!
" Nice movie
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,10,"Shraab ka nasa khatarnaak hota hai, kya Parineeti Choprane sharaab ke nashe me Nusrat ko maara, watch it and explore. I cant be a spoiler but this is the best movie of 2021. dont miss it."
" Fantastic
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,10,"Alcohol abuse is awful but the movie highlight the problem in a very tactful manner. Movie is a thriller, but I liked the way the alcohol abuse was highlighted in the movie. High Five to the director and entire cast and crew"
" An average thriller with unnecessary elements, scattered screenplay and disaster characters.
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,5,"The Girl On The Train (2016) :
Brief Review -An average thriller with unnecessary elements, scattered screenplay and disaster characters. After hearing about the Bollywood remake of this film i decided to watch the original or can I say the first copy of the novel first so that the comparison would become fair. Not keeping high expectations has actually helpedme to bear this for 112 minutes, or else i might have used fast forward option many times during the watch. When you are making a Thriller you must make sure that it would have a suspense at the end which would worth the earlier set up, if not the entire narratives crumbles. The Girl On The Train could have easily been a good thriller if not very good or classic by using the necessary elements, instead it uses lots of unnecessary vulgar elements just to make it boring enough. To be frank now i feel like i am doing favour by calling it an Average film because if i watch it again i might even call it a Crap. The screenplay was such a mess, such a bore to handle in the first watch. I felt sleepy at least 5-6 times. Ok, let's say it clear and loud that it is not even a good thriller to be watched once then just forget that good rating you see on IMDb, it is not even half of it if seen with extra care. The story itself was ruined by disaster characters as if we should have felt sympathy about filthy characters? As if we should really cared about a wh**e or sl** whatever you call her, that goes missing, but for what? Those remaining two ladies were so dumb and pain in the a** i mean you couldn't even behave like an average brain and then decide to play smarty all of sudden, how? Somehow the climax survives because of completion and it feels like, oh yes finally it has ended, doesn't matter how but yes at least provides a dead end. Overall, a strictly average thriller, watch it only if have nothing else left.RATING - 5/10*By - #samthebestest"
" A somewhat decent drama-thriller
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,7,"The Girl on the Train (2016). A drama-thriller about a hardcore alcoholic woman, who lost it all in her life, riding on the train through environs where she used to live with her ex-husband, and thinking in terms of Allanis Morisette song: ""Are you thinking about me when you f* her?""Also, she is trying to peace together the events of the faithful night where the ex-husband's next-door neighbour gone missing, because she thinks that she might have had a hand in it (cause the neighbour next-door strikes a resemblance to the ex-husband's current wife). Has a twist in the end, which I personally did not expect, but that is all. 90 percent of the movie is just an alcoholic trying to piece together out-of-order events through a drunken haze.Overall, very Nordic in its presentation, but lacked some sort of zinc that would make it interesting for long."
" Interesting but becomes long and tiring 6/10
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,6,"I'm always in favor of mystery films with a crime around them and a compelling twist. unfortunately it doesn't always work with any kind of film from this specific genre. ""The Girl on the Train"" is just one of those movies who try too hard to have a compelling and shocking reveal near the end of the plot. although it starts pretty well, the length of the movie is just too long to bare and at one point I was about to quit watching and crash to bed. the cast was pretty good: Emily Blunt, Haley Bennett and Rebecca Ferguson are all talented actresses and act pretty well during the interactions between their characters. although acting is never enough if the audience loses their focus. overall it was decent enough."
" Brilliant
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,10,"I'm not sure why this movie is so underrated, while real rubbish series like Ratched has so high scoring.
In my opinion it's great trailer if you are really focused on movie.
It's might slow at begining and story develops and it shown in different episodes, but it surprises at the end.
Good movie highly recommend."
" Terrific if slightly sad movie
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,8,"This to me was a very good film. Well written with great acting performances. You can tell good acting because it never looks like someone is acting, you just see a character carrying out their behavior. It is well paced, intriguing and an excellent film to watch. This is all based on something well written to begin with. There are no special effects and other such cheap trickery. We are however lead to believe circumstances were one way, when it is later revealed they were another. So that's a little bit tricky in a nice satisfying way towards the end of the film. It gives us a payoff and we feel glad to have sat through it all till the end. Good film. I hope this review or opinion helps someone and that they also enjoy the film, or give it a miss accordingly. Thanks for reading."
" Spoilt the book for me
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,1,This movie males no sense and is frustrating from the beginning to the end. The climax is borderline ridiculous. Thankfully I read the book prior and enjoyed it. The movie completely spoils the book.
" Emily Blunt was great
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,8,This movie is IMO better than the book. Emily Blunt does an outstanding job as the main character. I loved it!
" A real surprise
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a must see for all women who have lived with domestic violence. If you don't understand the term ""gas lighting"" you will after this. So many women have found themselves in this situation.This movie will help victims to understand how manipulative & twisted a partner can be. It may even help some women understand what has happened to them & give them a chance to move past all the pain."
" Not bad, but should have been much better
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,6,"The Girl on the Train aspires to be a domestic psychological thriller on par with The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. Bit it's not as good as it could have been. It does have a lot going for it - three strong female leads and a cracking plot idea. An alcoholic young woman (Emily Blunt) rides trains and gets vicariously engrossed in the life of a seemingly happy young couple she sees from a train, and she is also still obsessed with her ex husband and his new wife, who live a few doors up from the couple. Just a bit of a coincidence, no? So our heroine gets off the train and tries to find out what happened to the young woman of the first couple, who goes missing. No one believes her when she starts realising who might be behind the disappearance. She is gaslighted by pretty much everyone. And even she doesn't trust herself due to blackouts and all her mental problems. The scenes aren't snappy enough, and the movie swings from one moody, melodramatic scene to another and from the present to flashbacks, with an emphasis on great lighting and camera angles and music better suited to a music video or a TV tabloid true crime series. There are some great small roles including Alison Janney and Lisa Kudrow as a detective and an ex workmate of the drunk girl. Blunt's is an interesting central character. She's at rock bottom in her life. I did watch to the end, but I kind of went, 'meh' because the script could have done with more work. But the finale was definitely less schlocky than in the book. And the last scene is very good."
" Excellent Movie, Worth Watching
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,10,"I enjoyed this movie to the most, the acting, the thriller and the plot. I didn't read the book, and I've read that this movie doesn't correspond with the book in every small detail, so what! it's still a well directed piece of art, and comparisons aren't always good things to make, so just hit play button and enjoy!"
" Gripping, but should have remained based in the UK
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,5,"Gripping film, strong plot and fantastic performances by Blunt and Bennet in particular. The biggest disappointment with this film is that it just does not work in the New York setting it has been moved to. I strongly believe it the film had remained set in the UK, it would have been received better."
" Definitely
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,8,New new concept from my better watched this is from 10 list best the movie
" Gaslighting as seen by the victim
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,8,"I have undertaken this review to counter the negative ones, especially those comparing this film to the totally irrelevant Gone Girl. In my view, the film is a new and improved configuration of the classic film Gaslight, 1944 (I have not seen the earlier British version of 1940).As in Gaslight, this film concerns a husband ensnaring his wife with lies to convince her she was insane or otherwise inadequate. Hence the psychological term ""gaslighting"" for this kind of abuse. The basic idea is the same, even though the plot details differ. More importantly, the psychological angle is much more developed, making the film a vastly improved version of the 1944 original.The story is told from the deliberately narrow point of view of the abused wife, Rachel. For this reason, it fully develops only two characters: Rachel herself as she observes everyone else, and her idealized model Megan, who turns out to be anything but. All other characters are fleeting shadows as seen by Rachel, therefore otherwise undeveloped (and rightly so).We meet Rachel after the separation from her husband, her personality still devastated by his gaslighting of her. The next stage is cognitive dissonance, at first concerning Megan and then others. This leads to recognizing truths, which in turn leads to recovery. I shall tell no more, so as not to multiply spoilers."
" Wow what a surprise
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,9,"That was so surprising, from all the bad reviews I was expecting an awful film but i absolutely loved that. HOW! Did emily blunt not win an oscar for her role. She was incredible, an absolute pleasure to watch. As soon as i clocked it was her ex husband who was having an afair with megan and who killed her, i could'nt believe it. Great twist for the film. Im really harsh with my ratings so you know this must be good."
" The Girl on the Train features a great performance from Emily Blunt, but has poor writing and pacing
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,4,"Beside Emily Blunt's strong performance, this film was pretty disappointing on the whole. I had someone try to tell me that this was a good movie that deserve better critical reviews than it got, I'm sorry, but this film deserved mixed to negative reviews, it was overly convoluted and disjointed. Gone Girl was much better than this. So yeah, I definitely don't recommend The Girl on the Train. 4/10"
" Quite good
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,7,"This was almost like a Lifetime movie but only better. I never had to ask ""Why did they, or didn't they, do this or that?"" Meaning they characters responses to situations was more or less what I would expect, as opposed to something stupid happening. The closest thing to being questionable would be is Emily Blunts eyesight THAT good? The acting was very good by the whole cast, plus I was impressed with the very visual cinematography. The first hour was very intriguing but I was a little confused by the various time period changes. Just a little, although it really didn't matter in the end. And about the end.... the final 25 minutes were very good."
" Mind gobbling Steady Thriller
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,9,Emily blunts performance in this movie as an alcoholic was different from her usual role. Rebecca Ferguson role was slow but superb reply in the end for her character. Screenplay was normal and slow at first half whereas it gets its rage in second half while twist & turns in this family drama thriller. Good anticlimax portion was the master piece by director. Superb movie with fantastic message and attention about women's life
" Women in trouble.
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,6,"This is a silver screen adaptation of the titular bestselling mystery novel by Paula Hawkins, who has also authored more similar titles such as Into the Water and the forthcoming A Slow Fire Burning which is expected to be published on August 31st, 2021 by Doubleday. Though the film stays loyal to both the basic plot premise and narrative structure of the novel, some minor differences separate them. First of all, the book's setting is London while the movie takes place in New York, the protagonist, Rachel Watson, is much more damaged in the book than in the film, some characters have a much more significant role in Paula Hawkins's fictional universe than in Tate Taylor's adaptation and some other discrepancies that set the movie apart from the novel. Nevertheless, Erin Cressida Wilson (Chloe, Secretary) who wrote the screenplay succeeds in retaining the original source's mood and atmosphere, stressing the importance of the main characters' often irrational, erratic behavior that moves the story forward and keeps the audience engaged throughout the movie's runtime. The Girl on the Train features a strong cast with Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada, Edge of Tomorrow), Rebecca Ferguson (Snowman, Doctor Sleep), Haley Bennett (The Magnificent Seven, Music and Lyrics), and Justin Theroux (Mulholland Drive, American Psycho). Blunt gives an outstanding performance as Rachel, a troubled woman who has a severe drinking problem and spends her time stalking her ex-husband, Tom (J. Theroux), and his new wife, Anna (R. Ferguson). Haley Bennett's striking presence shines in her portrayal of Megan, an equally tormented female soul, whose disappearance constitutes the movie's great mystery.Rachel is a young woman whose life turned upside down when her husband, Tom, abandoned her and chose to live with his lover, Anna, who soon gets pregnant. After losing her job, due to her alcoholism, Rachel has nothing else to do but to commute every day to New York by train. Each day, she passes by her old house where Tom lives now along with Anna and their baby girl, Eve. Trying to fight the jealousy and pain that plagues her, she gets obsessed with another young couple living a few houses down: Megan and Scot Hipwell (Luke Evans). Rachel creates an idyllic picture of the couple, imagining only the best for both of them and their life together. When, one day, Rachel witnesses a suspicious kiss between Megan and an unknown man on the porch of her house, she becomes livid with rage as the picture of the perfect family gets cracked once and for all. The sight of Megan's betrayal will lead Rachel to a drinking binge that will render her unconscious at the end of the day. The day after, the police arrive at her house in order to ask her about Megan, who has disappeared without a trace. Rachel is certain that she has seen something the night before, but she can't remember a single thing as she suffered a complete blackout. She will have to put the fragments of her memory in order, to make sense of what had happened. The only thing she doesn't know is that the truth about what happened to Megan will affect her personally in ways that she can't even fathom.We watch the story unravel in an unconventional, non-linear format, through the eyes of the three female protagonists: Rachel, Megan, and Anna. The narration jumps back and forth in time, with many flashbacks and flashforwards that create a rather jumbled feeling to the audience, especially during the first half of the film. The narrative structure is adopted from the book but makes much less sense on the screen than on the page. The story is multi-layered and each narrative segment, corresponding to one of the three main characters is supposed to peel back an additional layer to the story. Nevertheless, the individual stories are not balanced and this uneven feeling is all the more evident as Rachel's perspective is undoubtedly dominant while Anna's is almost non-existent. In the last 30 minutes, the story becomes clearer and the final twist is nice, though a bit conventional, particularly for the fans of the genre.Overall, I would say that The Girl on the Train is an enjoyable mystery/thriller that has its flaws, nevertheless, wins the audiences' hearts mainly due to the great performances and dark cinematography that is reminiscent of David Lynch's work. It's a fit choice for the genre's aficionados who wish to spend a couple of entertaining hours in front of the screen and those who haven't read Paula Hawkins's novel will be surprised by the film's unorthodox narrative pattern. If you enjoyed David Fincher's Gone Girl, another splendid cinema adaptation of Gillian Flynn's titular novel that used similar narrative tropes, then you should give The Girl on the Train a chance, always keeping in mind that the two movies are not of equal stature."
" Okay movie
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,6,"Pretty predictable, I knew 3 things before they happened (including who the obvious killer was), so that is dissappointing.Other than that it was an okay movie, it's not a total waste of your time."
" Watch it to see how good Emily Blunt really is
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,7,"It's not the greatest of films, which disappointed me because Paula Hawkins' book on which it was closely based was a fabulous piece of writing. Hawkins captured the main character's self-destructive alcoholism so well. Perhaps the biggest let-down was changing the milieu from crowded, stuffy England to the broad open spaces of the USA.But The Girl on the Train is certainly watchable as an enjoyable thriller, one I'd normally rate as a six out of ten, a good evening-filler that'll keep you guessing albeit at a slow pace.It gets an extra star from me for Emily Blunt's performance. I've heard it said a few times that playing a drunk is one of the hardest roles, it is so easy to overplay and have every scene slide into the ridiculous. Blunt is terrific in the titular role. It may be one of her best, and she was nominated for both BAFTA and SAG awards. I've watched the film three times even though I obviously know 'whodunnit', the reason being one of admiration for Emily Blunt, and I have no clue how she does it but she does it exceptionally well."
" Not so confusing
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,6,"I walked into this knowing it was a confusing movie. The only confusing thing was the decision of the director the timeline, that's it. The movie was decent but the forced confusion ruined it for me. Even more so when I figured out the movie's plot halfway through.
6/10"
" The Girl on the Train(2016)
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,8,"The Girl on the Train is based on Paula Hawkins' bestselling thriller that shocked the world. Rachel (Emily Blunt), devastated by her recent divorce, spends her daily commute fantasizing about the seemingly perfect couple who live in a house that her train passes every day. Everything changes when she sees something shocking happen there, and becomes entangled in the mystery that unfolds.I enjoyed how compelling the story and characters were. The characters, while unlikable, were well developed, which is hard to do when you use multiple narratives. Emily Blunt gives a career defining performance as Rachel, she plays the perpetually drunken Rachel with a believable fatigue and stupor that reinforces her as an ""unreliable witness"" allowing us to connect and even sympathize with her deeply flawed protagonist. The supporting cast of seasoned Hollywood role players all perform admirably in their roles, and Allison Janney in particular shines as a detective who is skeptical of Rachel's testimony.This film feature excellent screenwriting, acting, directing, cinematography, and set decoration. This was a blind buy for me. When Emily Blunt is in a film it is a good bet the film will not disappoint . Emily really shine through; one of Blunt's best performances. You are not going to find to many other films that has the emotional range as this film. It will completely draw you in. Excellent film and addition to my collection."
" Boring train, hopeless characters and no story.
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,3,"I feel there is nothing in movie. First half and over period nothing happens only three or four characters are talking, some sex scenes you can watch as you are watching porn movie. Emotions and relations are not properly described. But one thing is watchable that the acting of Emily Blunt. She perfectly did her job and at least I impressed by her emotional face expressions. But it is not sufficient to bid you till the end. I could not go to end and off the movie. You only can watch on your own. I do not recommend to others."
" I liked it, even if mystery thriller is not my usual kind of genre
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,8,"I don't usually watch mystery thriller dramas - I generally only go to big budget action movies. I knew next to nothing going in about what this movie was about, which is probably the best way to go into this movie (so in this review I'm not going to discuss the plot at all, just how I felt about the movie - it's better this way). I knew Emily Blunt was in the movie and that it was based on a novel and that's really about this it. Despite all this, I actually liked this movie.Who hasn't observed strangers from a distance and imagined our own life stories for them? What if we got lost in our own imagined thoughts and turned them into a dangerous obsession? It's an interesting premise on which to base a story.The movie kept me guessing; it wasn't predictable. It had me feeling disturbed, engaged, sad, and cringing at the unfolding events. I guess this is exactly what you'd want from a mystery thriller."
" A solid adaptation of a great novel
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,7,"I'll caveat this review by saying that I had read the book prior to watching the film which, with films like this is always a bit of a disadvantage. The plot relies on the mystery, the suspense, the shock, the thrill. All of which was taken away from me having read the book. As a result, in all honesty I'd say if you've read the book maybe don't bother with the film. Don't get me wrong the film is solid, and is a faithful and accomplished adaptation of the book, but that's all it is. It doesn't expand on it or change elements very heavily. Often a book being faithfully adapted can be a curse as much as a blessing.The performances were all pretty good, particularly Emily Blunt, who played the part of Rachel very well I thought (despite a sporadic attempt at a US accent in parts). She brought to life the desperation, confusion and guilt of the character very well and was a very strong lead. The support cast were all great too, particularly Rebecca Ferguson who I thought stood out, as well as Justin Theroux. It was a well put together cast who all played their parts well.In terms of the plot, its a great story and very well told. I won't go into any details as plots like this are best approached cold in my opinion so that you can fully enjoy all of the twists and turns, but suffice to say it delivers everything you want from a crime suspense thriller. The story drip feeds you clues and red herrings, to keep you interested and guessing the plot until the final reveal. The characters are intriguing, very flawed and real feeling with good exploration and depth. The book was quite gritty and real in exploring its characters, and the film picks this up well. It's a great plot, so you won't be disappointed there.One of my criticisms was that I thought the film was cut a bit weird in places. There were a few scenes that were far too choppy, so I think the camera work and direction could have been a bit cleaner in parts. I did also think the pacing was a little off, but maybe that's because I knew the ending so the plot wasn't as exciting to me as it could have been.For fans of thrillers and mysteries definitely give The Girl On The Train a go as it has everything you want from this kind of story, and is a perfectly fine film. However if you've read the book I don't think there's too much sense treading over old ground."
" A MUST SEE MOVIE !
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a thriller which is truly AWESOME !Amazing plot, with great actors (Emily Blunt...) and duly directed.I was TOTALLY inside this movie and I have ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH !If you want to see a real good thriller, well then watch it and you won't be disappointed. ;)"
" Neither Great, Nor Terrible, But Boasting A Performance By Blunt That Elevates Things Considerably.
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,6,"So maybe you have read that its not a great movie. That would be correct. But if you read its terrible then that would be incorrect. Its essentially a psychological drama, that works pretty good as a psychological drama. Now what elevates matters condiderably is that Blunt provides a performance that makes you sympathetic towards mentally ill alcoholics. I mean, I shed a few tears. She is just so pathetic. But beautifully pathetic. By the end I wanted her to triumph, and dreaded a twist ending. Thankfully their was none. So if you want Bergnan, forget it. But if you want a decent time waster, then I would say your safe."
" Emily Blunt should get an Oscar for this
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,10,"Wow great movie sad, tragic, dark just a real roller coaster of emotions! Loved every minute seeing the world through Rachel Watson's eyes! Emily Blunt and each of the principles in this give the best performances it's just draws you in and twists you around. Recommend highly!"
" I saw the film twice and read the book once
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,4,"It took me three encounters with this weird movie to get the point. When I got the point I realized I was no longer interested. I also wonder why the book takes place in LONDON and its northern suburbs while the film is transported to New York City and the HUDSON VALLEY.I think the books got rave reviews because the novel loving NY elite wanted to push it, but the novel, like the movie, is quite mediocre."
" Solid thriller worth the watch
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,7,"Wow, people really are divided on this one. Most of the bad reviews seem to be from people who read the book. Ok, I think by now everyone knows it is a universal thing: the book is ALWAYS better so what do you even expect, seriously?
I haven't read the book and I enjoyed the movie; yes, it does start a bit slowly and yes, it could have been better directed but all in all, a pretty solid thriller that keeps you guessing long enough to be enjoyable."
" Dont Watch This Movie
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,1,"This movie is the one of the worst ive ever seen, its absolutely depressing, dark and boring at the same time, there are millions of other movies SO DON""T WATCH THIS MOVIE."
" Fine adaptation of a good book
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,6,"I really liked the book. It kept me guessing, and I was still caught off guard by the extent of the twist in the end. The movie was fine. The best part about it was Emily Blunt's acting. She was exceptional. It's worth a watch for sure, but I doubt it will join my rotation of favorites."
" Location and setting all wrong!
",2020-07-11 00:00:00,2,"""The Girl on the Train"" novel was exciting, fast-paced, and kept you guessing. The film adaptation was slow, boring, and who cared what happened.For me, the biggest issue was the setting. The setting is key to the book. It's about a woman who gets the train every day across London, and as anyone knows who has ever got a train in London (or another big UK city), the train tracks run along the back of people's houses, particularly the Victorian terraced houses, close enough to see inside. In these houses, you can hear your neighbours moving around, you live practically on top of each other. Because of this setting, Rachel is able to see into the lives of the people who live there.In the film adaptation, Hollywood switching the setting to rural America. The train goes slowly (for no apparent reason) past huge houses with balconies, and she sees into their lives from there, which seems highly unlikely considering the distance from the train track to the house and the speed the trains would travel at in a rural location. It makes absolutely no sense for the film to be set in America and loses a key element of the book.Continuing with the mess of the setting, they cast a British actress (Blunt) and a Swedish actress who sounds British (Ferguson). Blunt's Englishness is jarring and even her great acting can't save this film. If you're going to cast people who sound British in a book where the key setting was London, then why set the film in America? I can't fathom why they thought that was a good idea.Somehow, the combination of the setting, the music, and the pace of the film means that what was an exciting book becomes slow and boring. It lacks tension, action, and drama. In essence, it just comes across a bit flat."
" Worth it in the end
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,7,"I watched this with my girlfriend because she had just read the book. Like the book, the film has a slow and mildly confusing start but it does get you involved with the lead character Rachel and then with the others. I'm not a huge fan of skipping about in the time frame to create drama - it seems like cheating - but it's all the rage now. Anyway, the conclusion was pretty gripping. Crime aficionados will probably guess whodunnit before the end but that doesn't spoil the fun. A gripping thriller and glad I watched it, though I could watch Hayley Bennett all day."
" A good start, then downhill the rest of the way
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,5,"My wife and I watched this film without real knowledge of what it was about. It began well enough and survived our usual practice of giving a movie ten minutes to engage us or we stop watching. We were intrigued as it got under way and we looked forward to a pleasant two hours accompanied by a glass or two of prosecco. But then the story got increasingly confusing. The prosecco can't in any way be to blame. First, there was the problem of three of the characters being blonde lookalikes, but what did it for us was the frequent, unnecessary and confusing time shifts. Despite this, we stuck with the film, hoping all along that it would get clearer and better, but it didn't, By the time the murderer was identified we had just stopped caring. A good story ruined by a too-clever script and too-clever editing. So, thank God for the chilled prosecco!"
" A good movie.
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,7,I thing is a good movie with good screenplay and good actiing in the main character.
" Terribly bad
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,1,One of the slowest stupidest movies I have seen. The blonde woman is so boring ..her acting is so bad she ruins any chance of getting thru this movie. Terrible casting!
" Exciting till the last second
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,8,"This movie is a smart movie. The choice of characters, the confusion you will get in the first part of it , is part of the story! Just keep watching and focus on the details"
" Overrated
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,5,"Not interesting. I watched with my family and I was so close to sleep multiple times, I guess if I ever watch it again alone I'm going to sleep 100%. Waste of time."
" Good movie
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,8,"Mysterious film, always captures you about what will come next, what will happen. Emily Blunt is stunning, script is strong. I like this kind of thriller like dramas and this is certainly a good example."
" Emily Blunt on fire 🔥
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,7,This movie should be watched because of Emily Blunt's performance alone.
" Very disappointing
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,5,"I usually love thrillers like this, but sadly this film is nowhere near up to par with some of the best in its genre. This is a boring, mopey film with listless direction. The ""twist"" is very underwhelming and doesn't really amount to much. The flashback structure is frustrating and the narrative as a whole just ends up being unsatisfying. I will say Emily Blunt is excellent in the title role and does what can with the lackluster material she's given."
" I ABORE a woman being called a girl, but eventually bought the movie anyway because of the cast and reviews...
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,1,"I can't stand this movie. I had to stop after 25 squirming, fidgeting minutes.If it's magically brilliant after that then, gosh, darn it, it's my loss.They did get my money, though..."
" Read the book
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,2,They really messed up the whole book they tried making it thriller through background sounds but that did help them.direction was really poor. Book was sooooo good and this movie ohh god. Emily blunt tried her best but because of the other things her acting goes into vein for nothing serously read book.
" They changed a lot...
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,5,"... even too much maybe. I just recently read the book and looked forward to watching the movie, but it's completely twisted. A lot of partially important details are missing and a lot of things happened differently in the book. The plot twists in the book are brilliantly written, in the movie not so much which made me angry, cause the book offered a lot that was simply ignored by the movie.
Please read the book and don't expect too much of the movie."
" Boring, farfetched and Unbelievable
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,2,"This movie, probably has a good base with the bestselling book, but is extremely boring even in the ""more exciting bits"". The acting is dramatic, but unbelievable over the top and unclear. It's really unbelievable that this story could be bestselling, the book must be so much better.It's a lot of the same, boring conversations about nothing, lame over-acting and the videography doesn't add anything to the movie, nor does the music - That's last one, honestly rather annoyed me during the whole film. Just took away my attention.Flat flat flat"
" Definitely worth watching!
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,8,"From the very beginning, I felt it was much more better than I expected.
I found myself drawn to this movie because every scene thrilled me to the next one.
Also, Emily Blunt was as brilliant in this movie as she was in others. Her presence was the essence of the screenplay twists and surprises.
After all it was one of the best movies I've ever watched."
" Not every adaptation works.
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,6,Missed the essence of English hum drum commute to work and looking for a world outside the carriage window. May have helped if they had not switched to US. Read the book instead
" awful editing and bad directing ruin the whole plot. it could be way better
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,3,"I don't know the book that based this film. But the movie has an interesting plot that is ruined completely with the editing. This could be a great mistery movie about a loner drunken woman that investigates a disappearance of someone she's been checking in the train windows. It's not, because they weren't able to edit it properly and also the director didn't have hands for the pace of this. First, i think the monologue option is not good. It's boring and preditable. in a book it might work, but in a movie is very rare that to happen. Second,how the camera moves. Sometimes it causes dizziness, it's hard for the director to keep the camera still, to have longer scenes with tension, he was not able to build a proper atmosphere. And also the music is a lot of times annoying and repetitive.it's a bit frustrating because this is the type of movies that could have worked very well it if had engaged in the thriller vibe - it tried to be a drama with the intersection of the lives of three women and their own personal traumas and problems. It failed completely in that. the score i'm giving s a bit low, but it's because it was easy to do better with this. Unforunately it was ruined by the editing and the director didn't have enough hands to handle this project."
" Temporal shifts and false memories confuse the viewer
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,8,"Most murder mystery stories start some background to introduce the characters, have a murder or two and then sequentially step through the investigation. Generally, there will be hints and clues dropped, some of which are relevant, but others that are meant to distract and confuse. In this one, the distract and confuse is done by temporal shifting and false memories, where there will be snippets from some time in the past and recollections that are sometimes more of a delusion by transfer of role in the events.
Rachel is a woman that commutes on a train along a track with water on one side and the back of a row of houses on the other. She generally sits on the side of the houses, so she occasionally sees the people in their back yards, or on their decks. Two of the people that she regularly sees are Scott and Megan and they are often embracing. Yet, one day she sees Megan with another man.
Rachel is heavy into alcohol, so she often has blackouts and her memory is very unreliable. When Megan turns up missing and then found dead, Rachel tries to get her mind in order and put her memories back in the realm of reality. For it is clear early on that she was likely the last person other than the murderer to see Megan alive.
The story bounces back and forth and Rachel is depicted as very unstable to the point of delusional, which is what she is. She is also a stalker, appearing suddenly at the home of her ex-husband and his new wife. She once even walked into their home and took their baby outside while the wife was sleeping.
Like a good murder mystery, the viewer is kept puzzled until the very end when all of it falls into place. Whether Rachel ever gets over the bottle and makes something of herself remains an unknown. The performances are excellent, all the usual suspects remain ambiguous to the extent that the viewer cannot determine the guilty."
" I like Emily Blunt, but I don't like this movie
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,5,"I was interested in the story, but I didn't like Emily Blunt as a victim.
The plot was quite OK.
That's why I give story 4/10 and plot 5/10.
So a total of 4.5/10, since I am generous I round up to 5/10."
" I liked this movie - lots of twists and turns
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,7,"If you think you've figured out this movie, keep watching. There are lots of twists and turns and many things are not what they seem. It kept my attention, but sometimes you have to be patient because parts of it are confusing until the end. Emily Blunt plays the main character well, although the drinking and desperation of her character can get a little repetitive.
Good for a night's entertainment."
" Potential but could have been better
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,5,Boring at times but kind of predictable. The concept of the story was better then the execution of the movie. Maybe the book is a lot better.
" Confused and confusing
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,3,"Emily Blunt can't keep her accent straight in Tate Taylor's film 'The Girl on the Train'; but that's not the only thing that's wonky in this confusing, and confused, film about an alcoholic prone to blackouts who may or may not have been involved in a murder for reasons unknown to her. The plot is hopelessly contrived, the characters make little sense, and the dialogue is unconvincing. Psychological thrillers can be entertaining; but this one is sadly just a mess."
" Emily Blunt performs superbly
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,7,"'The Girl on the Train' is average at best. Emily Blunt performs superbly, her co-stars are solid, but everything else is off. It's slow-paced without that much mystery, the film isn't predictable per se though there isn't much left to guess from a certain point."
" The Girl On The Train Is Not Good
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,1,"The movie is way too confusing and skips. The characters do not do a good job in delivering their lines and there is no chemistry. At times, Emily Blunt overacts the role making the audience want ing the movie to end."
" Fan Of Emily Blunt Go On With It!
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,7,"The Girl On The Train sometimes reality hurts for others, the story based on novel by (Paula Hawkins), mainly focused on Rachel (Emily Blunt) that she is a mentally abused women divorced from his husband, even she is a heart broken woman discovers something that leads to a reality from her past, the story of it can take picture of many humans how they are dealing with their desires, at first it starts out a bit mixed until you know the characters, the story is well paced and you will have some flashback scenes so keep your attention with it to build the story, you will be with Rachel and taking up the detective role yourself you will have some suspects guess for it you might know whose behind it, it builds the mysterious part of it as going forward with it, i watched this movie because of (Emily Blunt) i liked her taking the lead role, highly recommended if your up for a calm thriller time, 7/10⭐"
" The Girl on the Train Review

" They ruined this one
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,2,"They had THE BOOK of the year and THE ACTRESS of the year, and they made this terribly boring film. In the book the protagonist is an alcoholic but is so much more than that, they turned her into a boring mess."
" Rachel, Rachel
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,8,"I don't know if the captions stating how many weeks from Zero Hour were there to help or simply to confuse. They certainly just confused me!Other films this restless psychodrama reminded me of were 'The Innocents', 'The Nanny', 'Puzzle of a Downfall Child', 'The Offence' and the TV movie 'Voices Within', with Shelley Long; all featuring a powerhouse central performance as an individual fighting a losing battle with personal demons before colliding with those of others."
" A seriously good movie about a serious issue
",2019-12-24 00:00:00,9,Excellent suspense.And conveyed a very real and important life issue in an entertaining and relevant way.
" The book is amazing, this is dull
",2019-11-27 00:00:00,2,"I loved the novel. The movie was dull, and lacked the suspenseful energy of the book. It didn't feel like a mystery at all. I also don't understand why they changed the location, the race of the therapist, the police officer that Rachel primarily deals with, cut out Anna pretty much altogether, and just basically made Kathy disappear after very little appearance anyway with no boyfriend. Also Megan was not the Megan I imagined. Emily Blunt did well and the ending was the same, but that's unfortunately all the positive things about it for me. The book was exciting and the movie was boring."
" Slow and boring
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,5,Good actors but it was very difficult to keep up with the movie because of the time anadroms
" Direction at its peak
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,10,"This mpvoe is not for the averge folks looking for thrills, and cheap time pass. You really need to be thanking the direction for such a brilliant coceptulization and making such a high power movie. Only once ina decade are movies of such a caliber made."
" An interesting, sexy mystery
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,7,"I did not read the book, so I was happy to see what it was all about. Great performance from Emily Blunt, and an interesting story that had me thinking. I didn't love that the time jumped around, as some movies do, and almost feel the need to watch it again because of that. But it all came together nicely at the end."
" It could have been good but it has not been..
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,4,"This movie is around a main protagonist, a woman who is not in her right mind.
She is an alcoholic and she can not remember her actions while she is blacked out.
This scenario could easily be the schizophrenic scenario(someone has schizophrenia and they can not always separate real from fiction) or maybe dementia( they are not fully aware of what is happening ,they can not remember).
The only reason this alcohol problem exists is to serve the possible explanation that she could have killed someone without aknowledging it.
This is totally ridiculous. The only thing that it serves is to make the main character not likeable.
She has no life and she is stalking other people. And this is creepy and annoying.
And the whole thing about failing to get pregnant and getting cheated on,can not justify what she has become.
On the other hand we have the murdered woman, Meghan who clearly has deep psychological issues that derive from STUPIDITY.. We cannot sympathize with her about the loss of her baby because she killed it. Who takes a bath and holds a newborn baby in the bath and then falls asleep? It is not like the baby got sick or something. It was her careless and reckless behaviour that produced this outcome. So these people have like ""sad"" stories but in fact they are the villains in their own stories.
As for Anna, she deals with Rachel almost every day but she never blocks her number. Also in the end,why on earth did she pushed that wine bottle opener on her dying husbands neck? I mean she could have been accused for killing him on the first place. What was her motive(besides being psychopath)?
And moreover WHY did Tom kill Meghan? He had already dumped his 1st wife for someone else, why could not he deal leaving Anna or being a possible father to Meghan's baby?
In the whole film it is clearly shown that Anna is not important to him at all. It is not like he could not afford to lose her.
There are giant plotholes where the film is dumped in and rests in peace.
The only thing that it is nice is the decent acting which portrays the effect alcohol and betrayal have on some people.."
" Great movie made
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,10,"Some time ago I read the book that made this movie. The truth is, I didn't expect him to be that interesting. It conveyed all the emotion, tension and gloomy dynamics I felt in the book. Excellent cast. Great movie made."
" If your read the book...
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,2,"Then don't watch this movie. Bad adaptation: the book is a drama, the movie is a thriller without psychological depth."

" Tortuous, tedious and unpleasant psychological crime drama
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,4,"A divorced alcoholic (Emily Blunt) who regularly travels the train that parallels the Hudson River north of New York City is fixated on a house in her old neighborhood. When the woman of that house comes up missing, the girl on the train becomes entangled in the investigation. Justin Theroux plays her ex-husband, Rebecca Ferguson his new wife, Haley Bennett the missing woman, Luke Evans the missing woman's husband and Edgar Ramírez her therapist.""The Girl on the Train"" (2016) is a melancholy adult-oriented crime drama/mystery in the mold of ""Derailed"" (2005), ""The Clearing"" (2004), ""Snow Angels"" (2007), ""The River King"" (2005) and even ""Mystic River"" (2003). But it's by far the least of these. As far as technical filmmaking and cast go, there's no issue. The problem is the unpleasant story, its lack of sympathetic characters and the partly-troubling message at the end.The tale starts off confusing, but everything naturally comes together by the end and makes sense. Unfortunately, the journey there isn't very compelling and, like I said, the more you get to know the main characters the less you care for them, with one exception. The ultimate message is worthy, but also troubling if you think about it. I can't say anymore without giving anything away.At the end of the day this is an ugly flick with not enough to redeem it. The movies cited above also have seriously unsavory elements, but they override the ugliness one way or another.The film runs 1 hour, 52 minutes, and was shot entirely in New York: the Hudson River area north of the city, as well as the city itself from Bear Mountain in the closing scene.GRADE: C/C-"
" Strong and unique dark thriller
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,8,"Excellent film, well laid out with a great finale. The plot builds up using a series of flashbacks which return full circle and give a very revealing way of highlighting the main characters issue. Different, unique and plenty twists to keep you invested."
" A over hyped & Over rated movie
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,2,"I watched this movie
I go cinema with big expectations but very disappointed ,Script was so week,Nothing special with story line,twist was Average"
" It Overcomes A Slow and Confusing Start And Becomes A Solid Movie By The End
",2019-08-19 00:00:00,6,"To say the least, ""The Girl On The Train"" is a very dark movie. Unsettling. Confusing. Even baffling. There's an uneasy feel to this from the start. Something's off. Something's not right. Is this even reality, or is it a fantasy taking place inside the mind of a very disturbed woman? The disturbed woman in this case is Rachel (Emily Blunt.) She's an alcoholic and rides the same train every day, past the house where she used to live with her ex-husband. She sees their neighbours, and wonders about them and about their relationship. The female neighbour is the nanny to her ex-husband, his new wife and their baby. The movie mixes the story of all three (Rachel, Anna - the new wife, and Megan - the nanny) together. What drives it forward is that Megan has gone missing, and the question is what happened to her and who was responsible.For a while I found this an unpleasant movie to watch. To be honest, I had to turn it off at about the half hour mark. It wasn't hitting home with me. But there was something about it that drew me back; I needed to see how this was going to turn out. In the end I was glad that I did. It overcomes the bleakness of the first half hour and although it still seems to walk the line uneasily between fantasy and reality, the mystery involved gets more and more engrossing, and the plot twist (you knew something had to be coming) happens with about a half hour to go - and it was, to me at least, completely unexpected. Not all is as it seems to be. The inter-twining of the stories of Rachel, Anna and Megan leads up to a sobering finish.In the end I was surprised to discover that I was actually quite awakened from the slumber-inducing first half hour or so and really wanted to see how this was going to end. Emily Blunt's portrayal of Rachel was strong. The supporting cast was all right - I didn't think there were any outstanding performances aside from Blunt's, but it was Blunt's movie, and she pulled it off. It has to overcome that slow and bewildering first half hour, and it won't appeal to those who want a straightforward plot or who are put off by a movie with overtly dark tones. But by the time this was over I could honestly say that I was glad I watched it. (6/10)"
" Mediocre feminist propaganda movie
",2019-08-10 00:00:00,3,"Rather slow and boring movie, with occasionally interesting scenes, overwhelmed by the mediocre way in which it conveys the feminist propaganda, namely that men are pigs, while women are saints. Only that here the women are not quite saints either. One is a pathetic alcoholic, while the other two are willing adulteresses, who only mind it when the man is cheating on them too, while enjoying his favours when they are cheating his first wife, the poor alcoholic. The actors waste their acting, given the lifeless performance of the director, as well as the annoying way in which the chronology of events is deconstructed, like a knitting that is losing its stitches with no real motivation."

Emily Blunt and the rest of the cast were excellent.The movie flashes back and forth in time, so you need to concentrate, which is no bad thing.I am struggling to understand the very negative reviews, unless it is all about the differences to the book. A book and a movie are different mediums. Promote the book by all means but not by downgrading a perfectly good movie in its own right.I wish there were more cerebral thrillers of this calibre out there."

" Huge Disappointment
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,1,"Just watched this on FXX. Wow, what a huge disappointment. Emily Blunt was good as the alcoholic ex-wife. But having read the book, all I can say is: read the book--which was fabulous. Some books don't transition well into movies. This was certainly one. Bad casting and bad acting. Emily shines but can't save it. Sorry."

The producers move the story from the suburbs of London to Westchester Country, NY and give the characters grander homes than the modest duplexes the book provided, but keep most of the story elements in place. Emily Blunt is quite good as the confused and disturbed heroine, and I also like Allison Janney as Officer Riley, but some of the other actors didn't fit their parts as well. The film emphasizes the story's dark and tragic vibe, but I thought the book had something different: passion, randomness, and a sense of things unravelling. ""You were right all along,"" someone says to Rachel at the end, but she wasn't - she did not know what was going on; she was just drunkenly, instinctively stumbling around."
" Emily Blunt is brilliant
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,10,"Stella performance by the whole cast.
Very enjoyable....For sure give it a crack.Sometimes netflix has a few unturned stones that are jems.
Blunt is always good.
She blew me away in this one.
Well written ,great pace
Tight film"
" 'Based' on the book - not the book - Caveat emptor
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,5,"Sorry this will be very short, I've just lost my review! (By dint of WiFi!)Film: Suspensful, well acted. Too short to portray the nuances and relationships amongst the characters.Book: Everything and more the film wasn't. The book is set on a commuter route between Buckinghamshire and London. Imagine tightly packed Victorian terraces and there you have the setting for well in excess of 60% of the story. This was the let down in the film for me."
" How to kill the novel
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,1,"And i thought no book to film adaptation could be worse that dark places, but i stand corrected"
" Really good but something went wrong
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,7,"Well tought story and brilliant performances (Emily Blunt is an Oscar worthy actress), but it doesn't leave the taste that the movie ambition itself. Maybe because when I finally understand the characters I have already spend too much time critizing them. As advice, better to watch it without reference when you think to much about the ""what ifs"" you lose what the movie is trying to give you."
" A considerable series of wasted potential
",2019-06-14 00:00:00,5,"Strangely uneven, considering its premise and story line, and while the source material isn't as solid as thought, plenty of the opportunity this flick had to improve is wasted on confusing progression, attached to messy editing and dull direction, wasting the presence of A+ cast members, specially lead role Emily Blunt, whose presence lacks the grappling hook of her previous works, giving the actual appeal to Rebecca Ferguson's performance in a film too small for her."
" Poor
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,4,"Run of the mill mystery. Poor writing, no way to guess the ending."
" Didn't see that one coming.
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,9,"Emily Blunt was marvelous!! and I hated Anna in the movie too which made it perfect. The narration was spot on, which was something MISSING in the Gone Girl movie adaptation."
" Disturbing blend of quaint scenes, superficial intimacy, and human depravity
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,6,"If you're into this kind of thing. The movie seems to wallow in human twistedness. Very quaint, rustic homey scenes, disturbingly superficial intimacy between people, a lot of times unwarranted, and everybody seems dangerous and evil underneath, especially the volatile and abusive men. It's a simple message at the end: Stand up to BS, because men are predatorial and all are always on the lookout for victims. And women aren't your allies, with the one key (and extremely extraordinary) exception."
" A normal class film.
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,5,"The Girl on the Train is the first film of Emily Blunt that I watched. It's something mystery, but it is also some kind drama too. The way the film goes is kind of boring, but it makes you interested in the film. The story line isn't strong that much but it's kind of watchable.The makeup skill needs to be better. Emily Blunt is so ugly in this film.I think I don't need to say that much words because the film is at the normal acceptable level. It's kind of watchable, but if they could improve more, I bet it'd be a great film."
" Feminist agenda nonsense.
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,3,Truly awful show. Garbage plot. Garbage direction.
" It's a slow train, don't expect much excitement on the journey ...
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,6,"The Girl on the Train directed by Tate Taylor based on the best selling novel by Paula Hawkins was perhaps better left as a novel. For the first hour of the almost two hour long movie it was difficult to follow the plot or make a mental note of the characters. Yes, the pace improved in the second half and, at the very least, the main characters were no longer confusing.The story revolves around an alcoholic divorcee woman, Rachel, who becomes obsessed with a couple living in a house she passes on her daily commute into Manhattan. One day during these daiy voyeuristic commutes Rachel witnesses the woman kissing a man who is not her husband. Having been through a divorce with an unfaithful husband - who lives in their jointly purchased house a few doors down from the couple she obsesses about - Rachel loses it.Rachel, known for making unannounced visits to her ex-husband's home, subsequently tries to visit the apparently unfaithful woman (Megan) to give her a piece of her mind. Unfortunately for Rachel as she was in her usual drunken stupor she has little recollection of what transpired during that fateful visit. Unfortunate because that night Megan mysteriously disappeared.The story slowly unravels and the viewer pieces together the puzzle, all the while learning more about each character. (Yes, you know the old adage: don't judge a book by its cover.)The Girl on the Train is billed as a psychological thriller on many move sites. That's a fallacy. At best it's a mystery - albeit incuding a side role for a mysterious psychiatrist. Only the strength of the acting held it together with great performances put in by the cast. In case anyone's asking, I would say the book might be the better bet!"
" Something Missing
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,8,"The acting, directing and story, was all amazing yet it fell just short of being an amazing film, and I would only categorize it as very good.The acting was seamless, particularly from Emily Blunt who showed a wide range of ability. Sometimes just one bad move from an actor can release you from the grasp of a film you are immersed in, and The Girl on a Train, cannot be faulted in the casting, as no one failed in that aspect.I felt the story itself, and the way that it was told was very interesting. I am usually someone who works out the end of a mystery before it concludes, and this film provided me with surprises that I don't usually receive. The film goes back and forth with an almost Tarantino feel to it, with a dreamlike haze that mirrors Emily Blunts character.So why was it that I felt there was something missing from this film to qualify it as amazing, rather than just a very good film. Well although all the acting was brilliant, and I forgot that any of the cast, was acting, until the end, there was perhaps only one moment that really moved me, and I did not feel myself on the edge of my seat or screaming at the TV during scenes that would usually call for such a response. I am finding it very difficult to discern to why this is,considering the before mentioned positives of this film. All I can say is that I did not have the nail biting reaction or feeling of overwhelming suspense, that would have made it great. I also didn't really feel a deep connection to the characters. I did feel myself rooting for (not giving away any spoilers) But not in a way that I have with classic, or even great films, were I feel like they are almost someone I know, and I am generally worried and upset that harm may come to them.I found out after watching the film that the novel was set In London, and I do wonder if this was the magic that was missing ,because as of yet I don't know what it is, but there is something.All in all it is a very enjoyable film, I believe that perhaps women would find this much more suspenseful and nail biting than I did, and also be able to feel stronger emotions towards both the male and female characters. Would defiantly recommend, and there are not many films that I have seen similar to this,particularly in more recent times."
" A phenominal performance.
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,7,"This film probably needs more than one viewing to try to understand the complicated story. I must admit to not entirely concentrating on the film, whilst I was watching it. But what did come across, was Emily Blunt acting her socks off. She is a phenominal actress. This role is about as far removed from Mary Poppins as you could possibly get. It is a rather down beat film, but if you like to be intrigued and enjoy fine acting, then this is the film for you."
" Driverless train
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,1,What on earth was that all about?Was the journey enjoyable? No. Was the final destination (the reveal) satisfying? No. Was there a single character worth caring about? No.A muddled mess that should have been derailed in pre-production.
" Love the twist!
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,8,"I must start by saying that every negative review that slates the female characters seems to forget why Meghan was scared to have a other baby. She dropped her baby while asleep in the bath at aged 17- that was the saddest part for me abd I had to look away!I started off hating all the female characters too but once the reveals are made, I understood why Rachel and Meghan were such a mess. I struggled with Anna and why she needed a nanny!?But I was captivated for the duration of the movie and guessed the killer quite early on, which I didn't mind as I thought it was directed beautifully"
" 10/10 because it deserves higher than the current 6.5
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,10,"Watch this film for Emily Blunt's 'stunning performance', worth 10* for that alone, but the movie must deserve 8.5 minimum.
Keeping up with the retrospectives may be a bit disjointed for some, but you will probably watch this movie several times eventually, whereby, the retrospective is necessary and is crucial to the plot."
" Bit slow but it paids off
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,8,The screenplay is a little slow in places. Tate Taylor did an alright job directing this movie. I liked this motion picture because of the drama and mystery.
" It's not what you read about!
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,7,"Well, 6.5? That hardly does justice to a film which is so true to its origin. Indeed, I watched the movie within a couple of days after finishing the novel. And I am thoroughly satisfied. Except in a few minor changes, the movie is loyal to the novel and I can hardly expect any betterment in any of the areas. May be they all are so obsessed with Gone Girl that they thought giving it a poor rating would be a justice to that movie.In fact, I like both Gone Girl and this one and they are unique. Coincidentally the authors of both the great books are female.Well, that may be a pre-context. Coming back to this movie, it's an not an edge of the seat thriller. It takes time to build the milieu. It takes a bit time to develop the characters. But when it does, it just flies. Emily Blunt as alcoholic Rachel is just terrific. Rebecca Ferguson, right from Mission Impossible is wonderful to me. The rest of the casts do justice to the roles. But what plays the role of the protagonist is the bleak, cold, death like environment all around the movie. I give it a thumbs up and I again strongly feel that those giving poor ratings to this awesome crime thriller may not have read the book. 8 out of 10 from my side."
" The movie is better than the book
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,7,"Usually when the story of a movie is taken from a book, the novel is much better than its cinematographic transposition. In my opinion in this case it is the opposite, because I liked more the movie.
The rythm is intense, the actors good, the places beautiful and there is the suspense missed in the book.
The novel is too much introspective and low, while the movie is a real thriller adapt to a general audience. I liked it and I found it well done."
" Acceptable adaptation of a classic thriller
",2019-04-09 00:00:00,5,"Of course the book was better, but this is a solid adaptation of that hugely successfully psychological thriller. The producers move the story from the suburbs of London to Westchester Country, NY but keep most of the story elements in place. Emily Blunt is quite good as the confused and disturbed heroine, and I also like Allison Janney as Officer Riley, but some of the other actors didn't fit their parts as well. The film emphasizes the story's dark and tragic vibe, but I thought the book had more passion and randomness in it. ""You were right,"" someone says to Rachel at the end, but she wasn't - she did not know what was going on; she was just drunkenly, instinctively stumbling around."
" Oh, hello Phoebe Buffay!!
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,9,"Ok, so this film is good, but when you have read the book and then watch the film, the shock factor that the book gave you is gone. I still enjoyed this film even though I knew what the outcome of the film was. People criticised this film, and I believe this is because you can never truly match the experience you have when reading a brilliant book like girl on the train with watching a film based around the book. Reading stimulates the creative mind, so each person creates their own ""film"" when reading, in a way. People slated it because the characters didn't look like what they expected and where the film was based was different to how they saw it etc. Well everyone has a different imagination don't they.? I'm sure Paula Hawkins wasn't prepared for the media coverage she got let alone the book being created into a movie. However, I do agree with the opinion that it was a shame that the film was filmed in America because the book is based in London. However, I do question if they would be able to film in London because of the trains etc being so busy? It was a bit weird that the Rachel was British and the rest of the actors were American. I also kind of agree with the views that Emily blunt is too pretty to play Rachel, yes she is too pretty because Rachel is supposed to be a fat alcoholic, but then again, could anyone pull off the role as Rachel as good as Emily blunt ? Probably not. Her acting as a drunk person is so good she almost looks like she is possessed at certain points in the film ha! Oh and the title of the review is there because that's what I said to mylself, obviously in my head, whilst in the cinema, when I saw Lisa kudrow. I wasn't told she was in it, she only has a small part, but I think it is a crucial part of the film. It was nice to see that she is a diverse actress, and can take on a role of a completely different character. The book is overall better, but the film is good, also."
" Emily Blunt knocks it out of the park
",2019-03-14 00:00:00,7,"The film around her is pretty weak for the first half with her acting really pulling you through (particularly in a phenomenal scene with her and her therapist). The second half of the film is much stronger and parts, particularly the end are actually thrilling, even if the film still has the trashy vibe the book had. Haley Bennett also does a good job when the writing (which is pretty much saved by the book having such an interesting plot anyway) allows her to do so. The camera work is the sole other brilliant factor, distorting the view of the audience to parallel Rachel's mind and our natural confusion."
" Great Movie, harshly rated due to book comparisons
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,8,"If you haven't read the book and you like a good thriller, you'll love this movie. It seems to have been unfairly marked down because it isn't as good/the same as the book. Emily Blunt does an absolutely fantastic job!"
" Watch it and Be Your Own Judge
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,8,"I don't think I have ever posted a review on a movie before, but after seeing so many negative reviews I felt as thought this movie deserves another perspective. I will note that I have not read the book, and I also acknowledge that books usually (if not always) are better than movies. However, this film is so subtly impacting it truly was a pleasure to watch. Emily Blunt portrays an impeccable female lead, I don't know that anyone could have done better. The emotional depth of this movie and the reality of prolonged emotional and psychological abuse is absolutely accurate. A story/movie does not have to be in-your-face and action-packed to leave an impression, and I can't help but feel that those who did not appreciate the raw purpose of this movie may not be intellectually or artistically capable of filling in the blanks themselves. Please watch this movie and judge for yourselves."
" a delicious slow burning morsel of a thriller
",2019-02-28 00:00:00,8,"A chilly, violent thriller made memorable by its dark layers, Tate Taylor's The Girl on the Train provides a twisty and biting experience. Featuring an outstanding performance by Emily Blunt, the drama weaves an evocative portrait of disease, deceit, and the evil that human beings visit on one another.
Strikingly executed and engagingly told, The Girl on the Train is darkly appealing. With its focus on muddied truths and eventual recovery, the drama carries an inviting depth communicated through skillful performances and stirring direction."
" A Solid Thriller
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,7,This was a really decent thriller. It had loads of twists and turns and had a really strong cast who all gave excellent performances. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. At times it was very dark and not your run of the mill Hollywood movie. A good watch and recommended.
" Waste of time to watch
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,1,It got darker as the movie went on. I did not enjoy at all.
" Interesting!
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,8,Rachel (Emily Blunt) saw everything.Very moving story...
" A case of the ""police procedures conveniently twisted for the audience""
",2019-02-14 00:00:00,3,"Many thrillers are based on bizarre - or downright absurd - police procedures twisted to fit the plot. To mention but one, Gone Girl suffered form a clearly illogical ending. However, it also proved that the audience can swallow a lot of absurdities for the sake of a few thrills.In this case, despite Emily Blunt's good performance, the execution is too sloppy to generate the consensus of Gone Girl. Emily plays Rachel, an alcoholic divorcee and unreliable narrator, who is fascinated by the allegedly perfect couple (Megan and Scott) she sees from her train commute. They also happen to be her ex-hubby Tom next door neighbours, who moved in after Rachel and Tom divorced.While Tom is presently settled with ex mistress, now official second wife Anna, Rachel is reaching rock bottom, often hanging around her previous house in drunken despair. Having discovered that Megan is unfaithful to her husband, in a fit of drunken rage Rachel decides to take the matter in her hands. The plot is based on Rachel black-out of the events leading to Megan disappearance and the ensuing investigation.In cases as this, the husband is always the first suspect, his movements and alibi being checked ASAP. However, in the movie it looks like the idea of checking on Scott comes only as an afterthought, because it makes so much more sense that a complete stranger like Rachel might have done the did for absolutely no reason whatsoever...I am not revealing any plot twist, because the final one is quite predictable. The lackluster performance of ""Girl on a train"" is probably due to many factors, such as the theme of maternity hammered in at every chance; the many gratuitous sex scenes; the nastiness of all characters and the lack of real tension.PS an alternative title could have been ""All women obsessed with reproductive challenges, all men jerks"""
" It's hard to care
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,3,"I love thrillers but Emily Blunt painfully over-acts and is all over the place here, which matches the script that jumps around constantly. There's not enough backstory to care about her sadness, the only character who's not over-acting and is at least partly formed character is the always fabulous Haley Bennet (Meghan).
What could've been a fun thriller with a better script is just not fun or fascinating."
" The book better be better!
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,6,Nothing really stands out. The movie is like a made for tv movie from the 90s back when they were making tons of these crime dramas with long boring monologues and a plot that I could some up in under a paragraph.
" Unexpected turn.
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,9,From the start to the ending i could not take my eyes away from the movie. I was in some sort of trance. I could feel the pain that the caracteres felt. I was blown away how the movie was construted.
" Surprising and thrilling
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,7,"Having no knowledge of the novel, and basing the experience upon the film. Expectations weren't too high thus finding the film to be quite good, entertaining and overall a thrilling and enjoyable ride. It may begin out to be slowed paced in the first 30 minutes but that seemed to help the film's set up.Emily Blunt delivers a very quality and genre defying role which puts this film over the top. The rest of the supporting cast are good as well and help gel the film together. Girl on the Train is suspenseful and when the plot kicks in (around the time Megan is found missing), the film kicks into another gear.Though this film may have been consider a disappointment to some people, as it had Oscar and award season expectations, it is still quite a fun watch. Noticeably most of the panned reviews and hateful comments come from people who have read the novel, which is quite obvious as they perhaps expected more and what was on screen turned different?Also reminiscence somewhat of Gone Girl (though that is better), this film is still worth the watch. Overall, Girl on the Train kept one guessing at each step which is what was looking for."
" ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,10,"Ignore all negative reviews, they're idiots!
Emily Blunt did an amazing job as lead character. An absorbing thriller, edge of your seat stuff. Never anticipated the conclusion. Very disturbing, very relevant, very awful. It will stay with me. Congratulations to all involved in the telling of this story. Compelling!"
" A good but not excellent movie
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,7,I think the makers where afraid to be too trashy and now it is a movie that can be watched by everyone. Really good but not the movie of the year.
" It was decent
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,6,Decent movie. Dark story line. But I never got chills or felt on the edge of the seat. I wanted more from it. More shocking twists and more trillers. Overall it was a decent movie and it had my attention and the acting was good.
" Wonderful possibilities - but alas poor execution by screenplay, director
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,6,"As others wrote in their reviews, my interest in the film was also sparked by seeing Gone Girl. The fact that the movie was set in a town near where I grew up (and my family still lives) - the nearby town of my high school sports rival Ardsley (though apparently shot in two adjoining towns, Irvington (where Washington Irving lived , his house is preserved as a museum - and near where he set such stories as Rip Van Winkle and The Headless Horseman) and Hastings on Hudson - increased my natural curiosity.Girls see things on trains - I recently saw again on television, ""Lady on a Train"" with Deanna Durbin. As this site states: ""While in a train halted at a station, Nikki Collins witnesses a murder committed in a nearby building. When she brings the police to the scene of the crime, they think she's crazy ..."" I own and saw several weeks ago, the movie of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple mystery,""4:50 from Paddington"". As this site says: ""A friend of Miss Marple's sees a woman being strangled in a passing train. When police cannot find a body and doubt the story, Miss Marple enlists professional housekeeper, Lucy Eyelesbarrow, to go undercover"".Well, Emily Blunt's character rides a train each morning and looks forward to peering out the window at a couple at the same house in Ardsley. (the train stops at Ardsley station near the house, so she has time to peer). We learn later that the couple consists of her former (unfaithful) husband and the mistress during that marriage,whom he's since married and with whom he continues to live in the same house in which he had lived with Blunt while they were married.The film revolves around Blunt's character and her friend (with whom she lives), and two married couples - her former husband and mistress now wife, and their governess and her husband. One of them goes missing- suspicion falls on more than one of the others - and the difficulties of an alcoholic's memory which would at least shed light on who done it.The movie has much in common with the wonderful domestic suspense thrillers of a few decades ago - particularly with Richard Gere and Michael Douglas: A Perfect Murder, Basic Instinct, Fatal Attraction, Final Analysis, Primal Fear, Unfaithful. Unfortunately each of those was superior to thisOne of my chief criticisms is that we are shown flashback after flashback after flashback throughout the film (perhaps 75?) only to be told later that they were false - and merely the mistaken understanding of the person apparently remembering. This causes us to mistrust EVERYTHING WE'RE NOW SEEING.
Perhaps all will be revealed as false. Thus, suspense cannot be developed - maybe it's not happening.Another criticism arises from the deliberate and repeated changes of time. Again and again we are told on the screen ""Last Friday"" or ""Two Months Ago"" or ""Four Months Ago"" or ""Six Months Ago"" or ""One Month Ago"" involving different characters - and we just never know when that earlier time period is no longer what is being shown. Nothing says ""Now ladies and gentlemen, back to the Present"" And there's no reaasn whatever for any of those flashbacks - why not show us chronologically?Another criticism is that two of the characters are simply made flat - the charming and beautiful Rebecca Ferguson (who was astonishingly good in The White Queen series) and the husband of the governess. Perhaps there was far more in the book - but in this film, they are simply not made interesting. They react as anyone would to anything happening around themAnother criticism is that the movie fails to acknowledge or even attempt to explain why - one character has an appeal to women that rivals Errol Flynn - every woman adores him (at first) and wants nothing more than to have him impregnate her. The movie doesn't seem to understand that this is what it is telling us.I join others in praising Emily Blunt's performance - deliberately made quite ugly looking, a sodden drunken mess in every way, coarse, gross, profane, and we believe this is who this character is - completely. It's quite a performance!"
" An ok film
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,6,"Interesting plot, good enough actors. Quite an American ending: everything is neatly explained, no loose ends. Nah."
" How come the men are so much older? Not believable
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,7,"All three ladies are young and attractive but the two men are older and it's hard to see any chemistry among them.
Except for that I enjoyed it - didn't expect it to be a mystery / psychological thriller but I was satisfied with the ending."
" Not quite
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,5,"This movie wanted to be ""Memento"" (a superior and more original psychological thriller), but falls into trite sisterhood tropes."
" Nobody in this movie is likable, except the baby.
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,7,A psychologically divorced alcoholic women rides the train every day without a destination in mind. She notices a couple living in a house by the RR tracks. The couple seem very much in love and she imagines being loved like that women There are a number of flash backs but they are not too confusing. The first 20 minutes makes little sense. Stick with it and the plot will unfold. Very good thriller..
" Dull with twists
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,3,"Girl on the train. Dull with twists, and because it was so dull, I couldn't be bothered to follow it. When the reveals occurred it was still dull. 3 out of ten"
" Train wreck!
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,2,"Extremely slow slow slow......all the male lead characters looked identical n were very hard to differentiate. Very boring very slow. It took a good hour into the film to realise that the missing Megan was in fact Rachel's (Emily Blunt) nemesis cos she had an affair with her husband. OMG sooooo slow!!!! Too many years from Ms Blunts character, too many flashbacks, too much of everything!!!!! 
It took toooooo long to drag this film to what would have been a 15minute conclusion from start to finish!"
" It's better than gone girl!
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,5,It's ok nothing great. The story was all over the place at times. It's very predictable also. I guess the killer in the half 20 minutes. The acting was pretty good. The ending was abit flat in my opinion. Worth an watch. 5/10
" Could have been better
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,6,"The first 30-45 minutes were incredibly boring. And after that I was just dissapointed with how much everything was sped up and I kindof missed the whole ""finding out what happened"" part. Acting, especially Emily Blunt, was really great tho!"
" One line
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,7,"Better than I thought it was going to be, but the casting of Justin Theroux was an error."
" Rather Frustrating
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,5,"I don't know if some of you feel the same way, but I found that the main character became rather annoying, and I have a feeling that I've missed a certain part of the movie, like when she's been fed all these horrible 'supposed' memories because she's been drinking, by her ex. Thats where I'm like, ""so did he drug her?"" Every flashback she looks wasted, and I don't particulary know why. 
Emily Blunt is a great actress, but I feel that this was a bit of downfall for her, I was too frustrated to even properly watch the movie, every second she was always wasted, which was really annoying and rather confusing in most of the scenes. I mean the very last scene was the only scene where she's actually sober. But hey, we've all got our opinions, and then I know she's drinking because she can't get over the fact that she can't have kids and her husband broke up with her and married the mistress, who in return could create a baby, in which Rachel so desperetly wanted. 
Could have been done a lot better, didn't really like and a little disapointed."
" Such a missed opportunity for greatness
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,5,There a a few factors to why this film is basically just a lifetime movie The cast while all separately great just don't gel together - had they stuck to the setting of the book most of the actors could have done their own accents - the New York setting doesn't suit the story.The main factor though is the direction - the whole thing is completely flat - zero style - the composition is so completely bland - Emily Blunt is basically carrying this film with her performanceHad this been directed by Fincher it would have soared.Also Rebecca Ferguson's wig was sooo distracting!
" Love this movie
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,10,Don't listen to the critics on this one. I think this is a solid film with great acting. Everytime it's on HBO I watch it over again. One thing that stood out for me was the score by Danny Elfman. It was subtle yet perfectly fit the mood of the entire movie. I think this is a perfect movie to watch when you want to stay home on a Saturday night.
" ok so bear with me...
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,10,"The ten is not for me. i rate this film a sold 7/8. I love this film and can't help but watch every time its on, but it's not AMAZING. i added the extra 2/3 points because i do think it's a good film, so i wanted my sister and mother in law to watch it while they were here this weekend. now i am no good with violence, but this movie is tame. or so i thought. the end made my sister freak out and run in and out of the room in a panic (she's 37 by the way) her mother in law was TRIPPING. so if a movie can make you do that, i'd say it's a damn good film. the story is solid, with just enough sordid confusion to make you confused as to whose story you're following. Emily Blunt, of course, is a star. what a great film for her to get to prove what she can do. (being pregnant IRL while filming i'm sure helped the 'alcoholic mess' look) the greatness in this film, like in most great films, is the ending. that ending where you go 'OH CRAP!'. because you didn't see it coming. there's so many brilliant red herring's. definitely recommended, although i can assure you it will not traumatize. my sister is just special. LOL"

" attention grabber
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,7,An interesting thriller. I never suspected who it was until the very end
" Great Cast, Great ideas, just a bit rushed.
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,5,"It is always difficult for a film to fully live up to the book, but it was well thought out but it could never be perfect. It focuses mainly on the main character ofcourse but the other female characters did not get the full attention they deserved. If one questions the other female characters and their actions, the book will provide you the clarity you seek. Revealing the villain in the end was less than riveting, he did not get enough screen time throughout the film to get to know him or care that he was ever there at all. There was no adequate confrontation and it ended at the click of two fingers. The climax deserved some extra time. As a whole, the cast is great and they did the best they could. A bit rushed for my taste."
" Fabulous drama
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,9,"Thoroughly enjoyed. Had already read the book and movie didn't disappoint. Tad confusing at the beginning however all becomes clear. Superb acting but Emily Blunt. Could watch it over & over.

" Please mind the gap
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,4,"A range of identikit characters in too-similar suburban houses, stultifying dialogue, and a lack of regard for basic screenplay make for an egregiously confusing film."
" Dont' believe the critics!
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,9,"The movie is highly underrated. It was beautifully shot, entertaining and gripping from the first to the last minute. Emily Blunt gives an amazing and convincing performance, as do all her co-stars."
" Superbly played by the main character, and below the average movie
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,8,"Rating this as a 6,5, witch is the current status, is absolutely absurd. Movies below 6 are are often rubbish, one have to rate 7 or up to rate a good movie. This is a good movie. The plot is not super-original, but it is original above the average thriller. Rachel, the main caracter, alcoholized, is suberbly played by Emily Blunt. 
She even have the alcoholics red skin around the cheek-area. Superb make-up. Apart from that, the story is well put together, and the last half of the movie makes up for the kind of slow beginning."
" Fabulous !!

" one of the worst movies i have ever seen
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,1,"It was not my cup of tea,i really could not understand what was going on in the movie. i found it really boring, there was lots of talking about love which wasnt intersting to me! i probably would prefer the book."
" Twisting Thriller, Trailer Doesn't Show it All!
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,9,"I had a feeling I would like this movie after viewing the trailer. In fact, I thought I knew exactly how it would go after seeing the trailer for it. I was VERY wrong.
So many twists and turns, and a completely unexpected ending. The Girl on the Train reminded me a bit of Gone Girl. If you're like me, you won't know what to think of any of the six main characters until the very end- everything you think you know can (and will) change at a moments' notice!"
" Read the Book instead
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,2,"How can a book be so good, but the movie so bad!? It seeemed to drag on interminably without going anywhere. Seriously, just read the book."
" Refreshing!
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,9,"Not just because I really love Emily as an actress but the film is really refreshing, nicely done, interesting, keeps you trying to follow (you might want to rewind it at certain points) a rather complex story, which is also good, it is not a shallow feelgood movie about nothing at all, it actually has a plot, which was developed perfectly by the director. Well done!"
" Garbage drama for post-divorce morons

" A Horror-able Mess-terpiece
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,3,"I wished I would have missed this train wreck because it was a slow moving, over dramatized, artsy-fartsy mess. I kept waiting for the film to get better, but it just kept getting worse. Thank God I bought a copy of this film on sale to watch at home and I didn't have to pay full price at the exorbitant theater ticket prices.I enjoy a good thriller/mystery but this film was a total mess. I give the film a generous 3 out of 10 rating only because I think the lead actress Emily Blunt did her best with a rotten screenplay. Mrs. Shullivan read the book and she felt that the book was also very convoluted. But why the producers cast a sole British actress to play the lead when the rest of the cast are all U.S. based actors residing in a major U.S. city, it just wreaks of a poor attempt to increase overseas ticket sales.If they made me watch it a second time I would have preferred to jump in front of the train instead."
" Somber and dreary.
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,3,"There's a lot here that doesn't make sense, in particular the reason for the girl being on the train. She has absolutely no reason for being on the train, as she is unemployed, yet still takes the train DAILY to nowhere, just to drive past her old house. The film never explores what she does from the time she takes the train in the morning until she takes it again in the afternoon. It is therefore just not credible. The entire film is also very somber and dreary, as there is never really a happy moment. Quite depressing, actually. It has a good twist, though, and a very good cast."
" Pretty good
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,8,I thought it was pretty good. Just wish I had read the book first because the story is very interesting.
" Kept Me Guessing
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,8,"This is an excellent mystery/thriller that had me 'grasping at straws' for a solid hour or so, trying to figure out who was 'good' and who was 'bad.' And...it's punctuated with a ""killer ending!"" (Yes, pun intended ~)Plot in a nutshell: An alcoholic loner subject to blackouts (Emily Blunt) immerses herself in a missing-persons case in which she becomes a prime suspect.(First let me state I have not read the novel on which this film is based. So my review and impressions are formed solely from watching the movie, where they should be. It seems most of the negative reviews here are from people who read the novel, then apparently watched this film with a notepad in hand, already knowing the story and the outcome but eagerly marking down every area that doesn't match the book, and then coming here to write negative reviews to vent about it. No offense to them (or you, if you are one of them), but the point here is to review the FILM - not to compare and contrast the film to the novel (or to anything else, for that matter). If you want to write a review of the book, go to Goodreads.com and write it there! This site is for the film, and it's what I want to know about. All of these reviews on here telling me about the book, and then giving a poor rating because the film isn't exactly like the book, are irrelevant and out of place. Let's talk about the FILM....)And yes, it's a very good one. Emily Blunt does such a masterful job of playing an alcoholic social outcast, I agree with some others on here wondering why she wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award. It's that good. She plays one of three women around whom the story largely revolves (Rebecca Ferguson and Haley Bennett are the others). These three are all loosely connected in various ways that are not obvious at first but, through flashbacks and story shifts, we are gradually shown how they tie together. One of the three goes missing and the plot then shifts to solving that mystery. Saying much more than this will ruin the story so I'll draw the line there. But I will say I found this to be highly entertaining and was constantly shifting my opinion as to who was the guilty one. At one point I guessed right (as it turned out) but I changed my opinion based on what was happening, only to find out I had been right 20 minutes ago! But that's the beauty of this film - just when you think you've got it figured out, you are given a new shred of information that makes you question everything you'd accepted before. That's good story-telling and worthy of acclaim. It's not a stretch to say ""The Girl on the Train"" comes from the same mold as the Agatha Christie and Alfred Hitchcock classics. If you like those, you'll probably like this too.8/10. Effective and intriguing mystery that deserves a much higher rating than it's current 6.5 here. Would I watch again (Y/N)?: Yes."
" Men are sad whiners
",2018-06-27 00:00:00,1,"I think the comments here are just so sad.
I don't have much to say about the film itself but the reviews here from men! Whining about this movie being men-hater and ""feminist"" as if its a bad thing. Lol! You whiners! How many years have men been getting off on violence agaibst women?! All you need to see is one horror film or any regular thriller. All about violence against women. 
And then a movie that shows violence against a guy and all the men are crying like little rats. 
Losers.
Btw I think this movie is unwatchable and never actually finished it."
" Not worth it
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,4,"If you've read the book I would avoid watching this. The book was amazing and I got into it so quickly, the fact that this followed the book very loosely was a bit of a disappointment for me. 
If you haven't read the book then you might enjoy this, it's okay but a bit over the top with the melodrama"
" Solid thriller
",2018-06-03 00:00:00,7,"A good solid thriller you don't get to see that often any more, at least not from a big production with stars acting. 
It's hard not to give away any spoiler about what is going on so I will keep this very short.
The butler did it!
I kid, I kid.
The movie is about a woman who is not at the best time of her life, who notices something outside the train she is riding. From then on it goes on a roller-coaster (sorry) of emotions and information for the viewer. It manages to keep you on your toes about what is going on and doesn't let go till the end as with all good thrillers. It's a solid movie that while it has some points it is trying to make that could be seen in a negative way, it still manages to entertain."
" If you loved the book... Do not watch this film.
",2018-05-28 00:00:00,3,"Loved the book? This has very little to do with that. An almost all American cast, not set in the UK and lacking any of the information about character that gives depth and thus makes the story addictive. Overly sexualised - except where it mattered and major plot development left out making the film a bit vague... Had high hopes, totally disappointed apart from Emily Blunt who was superb. Two hours of your life that would be much better spent reading the book!"
" Not as good as novel at all.
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,3,"I have several problem withthe story
I just dont understand why should she be involved in the murder their life wasnt her business. How is it that when ever she pass by train she always see them out or in contact. It kinda doesnt make sense to me even in novel i disnt like the second hundred page and then the story was on track again.
And by the way the novel was way better than the movie it couldnt picture the story well and it put 400 page in about 2 hour movie. In story rachel is fatt or not beautiful. In the story things are a lot more sensable"
" Masterclass in Storytelling
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,8,"If you watch the trailer you will be shown that this film is about a woman who sees certain events from a train and is possibly implicated in a mysterious disappearance. And I'm not going to tell you any more than the trailer does.I tend to open my reviews with a synopsis of the film in question. In the case of The Girl On A Train (adapted from a bestseller which I haven't read) I'm not going to do that, because I wouldn't want to deprive anyone of the experience I enjoyed, namely the unusual and well-crafted way in which this story was told. Providing a synopsis would damage that experience because it would inevitably entail revealing details which would ruin the way those details are revealed in the film.I have a fascination with storytelling. Most stories have some form of exposition dump in their early stages, whereby the reader/viewer is provided with information they need before the plot can get under way. The plot then unfolds before arriving at a resolution of some sort. In this film, however, we are initially provided with character studies of the main characters. These include expository details, of course but this is almost secondary. The film appears more concerned with creating mood and atmosphere, much of which is calculated to make us ask questions rather than simply supplying us with information. Information is provided, of course, but subtly, and in dribs and drabs.The characters are all well conceived to discharge their functions in the plot (the plot proper doesn't really start until nearly halfway through the film) yet the character traits and the connections between the characters are all natural and believable. For instance, each of the three principal characters has issues concerning childbirth: all are appropriate, relevant and credible, and all drive the plot.Thinking about this film as Story reveals how well-crafted it is, but you don't have to do that. Just enjoying the experience of having the story gradually reveal itself is perfectly sufficient.I don't normally care much for Emily Blunt, but she is wonderful in this. The rest of the cast is good, but she is exceptional."
" This is a real sleeper of a movie.
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,9,"I almost turned this movie off at 30 minutes. That's my cutoff time for bad ones. For some reason, I left it playing and kinda watched it. It was a very slow burn. The first 30 minutes were a snoozer. But then just after my cutoff time, the plot started moving forward. If you are going to watch this, plan on being bored for 30 minutes but the rest of the movie more than makes up for it. And you really have to watch it. There are so many entanglements that you won't know who is doing what to whom and why without really paying attention.It is worth it. Don't want to give anything away but it has a real ending (unlike lots of modern movies) and it will satisfy you with the way it all comes out. You CANNOT predict the ending. You cannot see it from 30 minutes away. Just wait for it. It will justify your time spent (1 hour, 51 minutes)."
" Had potential but wasted it
",2018-05-14 00:00:00,6,"I started watching this movie with no expextations but got pretty intrigued within the first 15 minutes. It kept getting more and more mysterious but also there were a ton of flaws. Its one of those crime movies where the police is a joke and dont do anything while regular people are playing detective. Also the timeline is incredibly confusing. Even though i like confusing timeline movies, this one wasnt done well. Its about a weird murder drama between a drunk woman, her ex-husband, his new wife, their babysitter, babysitter's husband and psychiatrist."
" Good movie
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,9,"Pretty sad.....This guy is the worst , as they come. Women don't deserve this treatment at alll I Hope this isn't based of a true incident."
" Fascinating adaption.
",2018-05-10 00:00:00,7,"Ah, the private torment of the 'secret' alcoholic - which really isn't a secret at all, which makes things even worse, and has you reaching for the Vodka. Emily Blunt is excellent as Rachel Watson, the main character, in this terrific adaption of Paula Hawkins' successful debut novel of the same name. The skin-crawling description of Watson's daily nightmare is recreated with equal relish here by director Tate Taylor. The moving of events from recognisable English suburbia to America works a lot better than I had anticipated, helped by a cast of actors from both sides of the Atlantic.Happily, Blunt's excellence does not exist in isolation. The ex-husband, the other woman, the other other woman, her ex and the splendid DS Riley (Allison Janney) all utterly convince as a nest of truly flawed characters. Their rough edges keep things interesting and stop events ever sinking into the melodrama they might otherwise have done. Watson's hapless stumbling leads her into and out of trouble, her condition never allowing us to take too seriously any of her wilder accusations. Which is interesting, as some of them may be true ...A fascinating drama then, beautifully shot, both as an adaption and in its own right."
" Just does not do it for me!
",2018-05-04 00:00:00,3,"The Girl on the Train is a three out of ten: What did not work: The story line was bouncy and hard to follow. The ill protagonist's memories are scattered, disjointed, and go back and forth in time. Then there is the artistic flair, of added , violent, sexual, random events/memories from the protagonist to create a 60's Euro style flair. The flash backs add noting, and cause a distraction. What worked: The acting was good. Most movies nowadays have great acting. The antagonist, and protagonist play their roles. The husband plays the complete psycho down pat. The protagonist figures out events and the Girl on the Train's story becomes aligned, and better to follow. The ending of the Girl on the Train is strong. The ending does not save The Girl on the Train, which derails. A poor screenplay and lost direction for a letter grade of an F, but my wife really like it."
" Unreal psychology
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,6,"As a film, it goes because it's not life. The plot line however does not seem to hold on to the psychological realities of the characters. i.e. not relating to real life. There are still very good bits of events sparsely populating the film. The atmosphere and the drunk world of the heroine works well. Fun to watch."
" Involving
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,8,"The film starts off pretty strong delving into the psyche of three women and creating a mystery on what had happened and what's gonna happen next but by the last half hour, it becomes just a pulp. But the terrific performances, some powerful scenes and involving the audience for the most part of the film makes it pretty good."
" Falls short of a really emotionally powerful movie
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,7,"So let's just get this out of the way, the two stand outs in this movie are Emily Blunt and Allison Janey, whose characters are so deep that I found myself wanting to know them. I wanted to talk to Rachel, and try to walk her through her rough patches and I wanted to have a drink with Detective Riley and talk about her uncanny insights into human nature... or is that vice versa?That said, when the movie would take you down one of these emotional paths, it would then switch directions because it was obvious to me that the director was trying to break you away from following obvious logical conclusions...that Tom was an abusive husband or that Rachel was actually a recovered alcoholic. I understand why Fincher used this technique (first off, it's his thing anyway, not to go in a linear temporal direction) as it did serve to reveal just enough to take you to the next level. This worked in the storyline but I feel like it cut my emotional ties to the characters. You don't really like some of the other characters until the last 20 minutes of the movie.At the end of the day you've got a one-dimensional (dead) psychotic ex-husband and a couple of emotionally tortured women he left in his wake. This film almost becomes a ""first world problems"" type of movie instead of a statement about addiction and emotional abuse... the Housewives of Westchester County and their indiscretions.Just as an aside, I used to occasionally take the Hudson line and I've known many of the places in this movie from commutes into NYC so there was kind of an appealing nostalgia to it on a personal level."
" another who done it
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,7,"It gives you about everything you would want from a murder mystery. I wasn't blown away, but I never considered turning it off. Worth the watch if you're looking for something a little dark and mysterious."
" Clever, but unengaging thriller
",2018-04-14 00:00:00,6,"The story is a twisting thriller, in which it gradually emerges that nothing is quite as it seems. The gradual reveal of the truth is what kept me interested in watching this, because I found it unengaging emotionally - possibly because the lead character is unsympathetic. That changes slightly as the story progresses, but it happened too slowly and I didn't care enough about any of the characters to be interested in their arc. What kept me watching was to see whodunnit, in the same way that you want to know the answer to a puzzle even though you have given up being interested in solving it."
" Felt Like A Violent Soap Opera
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,4,"(Flash Review)This tried to be a clever psychological thriller with a non-linear timeline and was far from successful. The story seemed to drag and stumble over its own attempted cleverness. The girl, actually a grown woman, believes she sees some infidelity going on from people she knows while passing by their house while riding on a train. She gets involved. Or does she? She is also an hallucinating alcoholic stemming from her divorce so reality may not be what it may seem. Anyway, what is really going on with this potential love triangle that she believes is happening? While nicely shot and acted, the story and editing are hard to follow with a story that didn't really give the audience much chance to piece it together until the final act. By then my interest had faded, as it felt repetitive, that I didn't care who did what and why."
" Book is much better but it's not terrible
",2018-04-04 00:00:00,6,"Just finished reading the book which I thoroughly enjoyed, it was gripping, thrilling and really made you constantly wonder about who dunnit. The format in which it was written from several character perspectives over a short period of time also lended itself very well to the way it read. A very easy read.However, the film suffers from poor editing. It really switches and changes far too quickly from different times, characters randomly appear with little explanation (ie Abdic) that I think if I hadn't read the book I'd have struggled to keep up with it coherently.Nearly all the characters are short changed, especially Luke Evans as Scott. virtually everyone to a degree seem to get large chunks of their character development expunged, to the detriment of the overall film.Emily Blunt plays the part pitch perfect although I struggle to accept her as how the character in the book is described. Also, the location moving to the states doesn't add anything to the film other than maybe getting more interest from the US audience. Do we really need another film set in or near New York?So in summary, if it had remained in London, been edited much tighter but given more scenes from the book to allow for character development and the actors were given more time to shine I think it would have been much more faithful and enjoyable, if thats the right word to describe the subject matter.It's not a - buy to keep and rewatch kinda film... Watch it on Netflix or Rent it and watch it one, but I recommend the book first. Either way the other you with or read first will ruin the experience of the other but I think reading it will just make you wan to watch it, whereas watching it won't really make you want to read it afterwards, which would be a terrible shame."
" A Thriller that keeps you guessing.
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,10,One of the best thriller of 2016. The twist at the end was amazing.
" Emily Blunt is The Girl on the Train
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,6,"How was Emily Blunt snubbed for her academy award nomination for this? In 2017 Meryl Streep was nominated for Florence Foster Jenkins, Ruth Negga for Loving, Emma Stone for La La Land, Natalie Portman for Jackie, and Isabelle Hubbert was nominated for Elle. Emily should have won. This is one of the better performances I've ever seen and no nomination? I love Emily Blunt. The Girl on the Train is twisty like some train tracks, darkly immersive during spouts like riding through tunnels on a train, and through and through way too boring like being on a long train ride but The Girl on the Train is ultimately belligerently gratifying by the happy end, like finally arriving at your desired destination. Good rewatchability factor, like eyeing the same people in the same house over and over again on your daily train commute."
" A gripping psychological thriller with plenty of twists
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,9,"This psychological thriller opens with Rachel, a commuter on a train into New York, looking out of the window. As they pass through the area where she used to live with her ex-husband, Tom, she looks at the house two doors away. She observes a woman, Megan, standing on the porch. She doesn't know anything about the woman but in her mind she imagines what her life might be like. In reality Megan was working as a nanny for Rachel's ex and his wife Anna until recently. Then one day Rachel sees Megan with a man who isn't her husband and is infuriated as it reminds her of how her marriage ended. She decides to get off the train at that station and as she does so she confronts a woman in a tunnel... the next thing she knows she is waking up at home covered in blood. It turns out Rachel is an alcoholic who is prone to blackouts and the day she got off the train was the last time anybody saw Megan. Rachel approaches Megan's husband Scott and, from photographs, identifies her psychiatrist as the man she saw Megan with. What follows is an investigation into what happened to Megan; there are many possibilities and Rachel is not the most reliable of witnesses; so much so that she doesn't even know if she was somehow involved in whatever happened.When I started watching this I was expecting to be reminded of 'Rear Window' but as the story played out the film this reminded me of most was 'Gone Girl'. Having an unreliable main character meant that until the end it is hard to guess exactly what happened to Megan and who was involved. This keeps things very tense right until the end. Through a series of flashbacks we learn more about Rachel's past as well as details of Megan's past. Emily Blunt does a really fine job as Rachel; it is hard not to sympathise with her character even when there is the possibility that she may have done something bad. There is fine support, most notably, from Haley Bennett, Rebecca Ferguson, Justin Theroux and Luke Evans as Megan, Anna, Tom and Scott. There are plenty of good twists, especially towards the end leading up to a finale which I must admit is a little melodramatic. Overall this is a solid psychological thriller that fans of the genre are likely to enjoy; I'd certainly recommend it."
" Great movie!
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,10,Very intriguing with a surprise ending that will shock you!
" Americanized catastrophe
",2018-03-24 00:00:00,2,"This could have been so good. After just having finished reading the book, I looked forward to see how the story came to life in the movie. The essence and the thrill of not knowing is completely gone though. Unfortunately, some scenes are also so over the top and unnecessarily americanized. It's one of those cases where you should just stick to reading the book. Don't watch it if you've read the book."
" An admirable adaptation that weaves its perspectives into the very fabric of its story-telling.
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,7,"Its execution may not quite reach its intention but to adapt a book with differing perspectives, each containing several integral internal monologues, without resorting to any sort of narration or indeed diluting the source so much that it loses its twisty, turbulent identity is admirable to say the least. It's actually even more impressive that each only somewhat condensed perspective is differentiated visually to the point that the camera itself conveys the story of 'The Girl On The Train (2016)' almost as much as the screenplay does. It's these perspectives that are integral to the various reveals, revelations, twists and turns that essentially make this secretive story so successful because it's a mystery which would be instantly solvable were the feature not blatantly hiding specific snippets of information under the sort of ingenious guise of its misguided and unreliable protagonists. When we're not given the information, it never feels like a betrayal of our trust because their perspectives are so ingrained with the very fabric of the film that it only feels logical we should be denied the information they themselves don't give each other or perhaps can't even remember. In retrospect, this technique is very obvious and some of it can seem a little bit cheap, but in the moment it works wonders. 7/10"
" What a mess
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,2,"When you can't make heads or tails of what's going on - and when - despite the fact that you've actually read and enjoyed the book, you know a movie is not about to get better. I was so excited to see this. The two-star rating is thanks to that anticipation; the reality is that the complex scenario of the book has been further twisted for no discernible reason, the characters divested of all appeal and at least half of the dialogue has been limited to some variation of the F word. The mystery and human interest is gone and what's left is just ugly."
" Confused confusing plot that is too tiresome to try to follow.
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,4,"Almost every character in this flick is UNpleasant, even nasty. The film needed better direction. Emily Blunt's accent bounced all over the place. NOT an enjoyable movie to watch; I was glad when it ended. Sorry, cannot recommend, and I wanted to like this so much. Interesting to see ""Phoebe"" from ""Friends"" in a small part. 3/1-0 for this movie overall. Don't bother with it."
" Drawn out, but worth it
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,6,"I haven't read the book, but i can tell that this thriller needs a bit more runtime. From the opening scene, to the flashbacks, there seems to be some plot points missing (maybe in the editing-chair). That's noticeable around the characters introduced in the end, such as the caterer at Tom's birthday and such. This is a shame because it wouldn't need more than a few minutes of screen-time in the early hour of the film, but ends up being a cheap way to tie up loose ends. Maybe it worked on paper, but is lacking on the emotional storytelling displayed on the big screen.With that said.... the film is still a really pleasant viewing. The characters are well written and acted. Especially Emily Blunt - who delivers a performance as a drunk, confused and distrusted woman caught up in a mysterious crime. The plot is well structured to leave the viewers surprised and captivated up until the end, even though it lacks in disposition. The interesting actors and emotional performances - makes up for most of the errors in the directing. The movie is not perfect, but also far from being bad."
" OK mystery drama to see it once
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,7,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Girl on the Train"" (2016) was just an OK movie overall, It had some mystery, but outcome was very clearly seen from the point it was clear that there was some mystery, The only and the best thing in this movie was performance by Emily Blunt - she carried this movie. Directing wasn't very good because plot and storytelling were kinda murky.Overall, ""The Girl on the Train"" is OK mystery drama to see it once on some boring evening."
" nothing compared to the book
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,6,"I thought this movie was terrible, I read the book first and I loved it, I was eager to watch the movie after I read the book and was hoping it would be as good but I was highly disappointed afterwards."
" Read the book
",2018-02-05 00:00:00,5,"All of the elements which drove the artistic success of the modern suspenseful noir that was the book work against it as a movie. The book unfolds inextractably but slowly. The narrative perspective changes with different character's stories falling on atop the next. Much of the suspense happens within the cerebral folds of mostly the main character but often within the thoughts of other characters. The actual physical action occurs ends quickly and much happens offscreen. All of these elements make this story of a wildly unreliable narrator embroiled in a murder easy to translate into a movie. While noble, staying true to the book probably worked against the story in this case. Emily Blunt as the titular, divorced, barren alcoholic doesn't commit to a physical transformation suggested by the character in the book who slides from withsome young wife to bloated drunk between present day and flashback. Blunt needed to blunt her attractiveness more in the way Charlize Theron did in ""Monster."" The film treats the husband as a somewhat minor costar compared to his more central role in the book. The lack of getting to know him in the movie makes the ending less impactful and this is definitely story that lives or dies by the final reveal. In short, read the book, an engaging and well told tale."
" The book is a masterpiece ! Movie is very poor. Good actors but screenplay very bad
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,4,"I read the book first 5/5. Masterpiece.
Then I watched the movie.
The actors are good.
But the screenplay , man it is soooo poor it is lacking of the whole substance that made the book great.
Also it skips lots of important details from the book.
This movie made me realize better read books than watch movies."
" A Compelling Psychological Thriller
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,8,"A fragmented flashback structure and an unreliable narrator are jointly used to describe the context within which a brutal murder takes place in this compelling psychological thriller. The device works well in making the mystery at the heart of its story far more intriguing than it would otherwise be and also reflects the sense of confusion and disorientation that play such an important part in the daily life of the main protagonist. Her inability to rely on the veracity of her own perceptions and memories is particularly troubling and the emotional pain and instability that she suffers as a consequence becomes increasingly hard to bear.Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt) is a depressed divorcee who regularly commutes by train between Ardsley-on-Hudson and Manhattan and routinely gazes out of her carriage window at the house where she used to live with her ex-husband Tom (Justin Theroux) who now lives there with his new wife, Anna (Rebecca Ferguson). Rachel feels huge resentment against the woman who was having an affair with Tom when they were still married and is now the mother of his baby daughter. Rachel had been unable to conceive during her marriage to Tom and the despair that she suffered as a consequence had been instrumental in her becoming an alcoholic. Just a few doors along from Tom's house live Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett) and her husband Scott (Luke Evans). Rachel sees them as a really perfect young couple and imagines that they must live a perfect life together.Rachel's bitterness against Tom and Anna manifests in some unpleasant ways which result in Anna living in fear of her and coming to the conclusion that she's unhinged. One day when she sees Megan on the balcony of her house hugging a man who isn't her husband, Rachel becomes incensed and in an alcohol-fuelled state, decides to confront the woman who she doesn't realize has also been employed by Tom as his daughter's nanny. Rachel has a blackout and wakes up back at her apartment covered in blood and bruises and subsequently learns that Megan has disappeared and that she's suspected of being involved.In the days that follow, Rachel tries to recall what happened on the night of her blackout and makes her own investigations into the circumstances surrounding Megan's disappearance and subsequent violent death. She makes only limited progress until one day on the train when she meets the wife of Tom's former boss and something that Martha (Lisa Kudrow) tells her proves to be the key to unlocking the mystery surrounding Megan's death.Based on Paula Hawkins' best selling novel of the same name, ""The Girl on the Train"" is consistently interesting to watch and understandably became a great commercial success. The three main female characters are all damaged in various ways by the treatment they've suffered from the men in their lives and issues to do with babies and the two main male characters are both controlling and abusive in different ways. The mood of the whole piece is rather downbeat and beautifully complemented by its top class cinematography, well-chosen colour palette and acting performances that are all commendably strong with Emily Blunt making her portrayal of Rachel especially intense and believable."
" Thriller & Mystery ?
",2018-01-26 00:00:00,2,"Not quite.
Poor scenario and direction. The effort to artificially complicate the story is very obvious."
" How one person's selfishness can destroy multiple lives
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,10,"By titling the book and movie ""The GIRL on the Train"" and making Rachel the narrator/protagonist, the audience is fooled into thinking this is Rachel's story, when really it isn't. This is TOM's story, and how his selfishness and single-minded pursuit of his own wants and desires ruins other people's lives. So here's a summary of the story, when you retell it from Tom's perspective:
Tom wants the stereotypical perfect suburban life with the stay-at-home wife and 2.5 kids. He marries Rachel, but it turns out she can't give him children. So rather than adopt (because they wouldn't be ""his"" children, which I believe the book did point out), Tom starts cheating on Rachel and lets her become a raging alcoholic. Tom divorces Rachel, leaving her life a total shambles, and moves on to marry Anna, who promptly produces the baby he wants. When Anna then starts to focus on the baby rather than Tom, he starts ANOTHER affair with Megan (because of course, it's still all about Tom and what he wants). Unfortunately for Megan, who doesn't want children because of a trauma in her past, she becomes pregnant with Tom's child. Well, Tom can't have a pregnant mistress ruining his ""happy"" marriage with Anna, so he murders the inconvenient mistress. And that, in a nutshell, is the real plot line of this story. So what is the role of the girl on the train, other than to be the discarded, barren first wife who turns to alcoholism to deal with the loss of her husband and home? In an act of karma, she gets to witness (from her train) a piece of evidence which draws her into Megan's disappearance/murder and ultimately bring Tom to the justice he so richly deserves."
" Is she jealous of what she could have had?
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,7,"This is a thriller that starts off slow and then goes headstrong into flashbacks. Rachel (Emily Blunt) is a divorcee that commutes to work on the train. It is quite mundane except for the fact that she stares out the window and passes by the house that she used to live in with her husband, who still resides there with his new wife and a child. Rachel happens to be alcoholic and also unable to have children, this makes her mind dwell about the things she wishes she had...a happy marriage and family. Trips to and from New York along the train route has Rachel's mind caught up in what was or wasn't and then one day, she witnesses something that enrages her. Soon the girl on the train finds herself embroiled in a sordid mystery.You can easily become bored with the flashbacks and in spite of decent acting, the finale comes and you may wonder if the amount of strong language was needed with the somewhat disjointed story line. Miss Blunt was strong and a good fit for the role.Also in the cast: Justin Theroux, Haley Bennett, Rebecca Ferguson, Luke Evans, Edgar Ramirez and Allison Janney."
" Riveting
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,9,"I am shocked by the mixed reviews here. I found the film to be riveting and engrossing. I was captivated and intrigued throughout. The film definitely kept me guessing. Very intense. If you liked the film Gone Girl, then you probably will enjoy this as well."
" What a waste of time.
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,1,Not my type of movie. This is NOT a mystery. It is a character study of wretched unlikable people tied together by loose threads. There is no plot development where things are revealed or plots twist and then you say AH HA... none of it. It is almost like every scene is independent of each other. This is not a spoiler but during the movie they just drop crap in your lap like bird crap out of a tree.The only thing good about the movie is that it ended and I got to sit on my own couch and watch it.
" Acting Great, Writing Not So Much
",2018-01-10 00:00:00,5,"This is a film with a fair share of plusses, which I will get to. But it fails, probably from the point the notion of adapting it from a novel arose. The plot line is probably one that can be followed well reading a book, and I did not read this. Perhaps this is a film that virtually requires the viewer to first read the book. No doubt there are many film adaptations of books where we all can say we enjoy both. But that's a different matter than saying, as here, the story simply cannot stand on its as a film. The filmmakers clearly determined their adaptation must follow the narrative at the level of detail it did here, which in a word was substantial. I sense the plot's requirements as such were what led to the often bad dialogue, and the use of plot to establish the characters, which can and often does become inadequate to such end. What may have been a great read when compressed into the film becomes tedious and at times exhausting.To be clear it is not the way such devices as flashbacks and the device of the husband's misrepresenting the blacked out ex-wife's recollections are not the problem so much. On the plus side the film has a great atmosphere to it, with carefully chosen location shoots that all well serve the story's feel. And the cast is near uniformly very good led by the excellent Emily Blunt, who probably deserves two or three of these five stars on her own. It's just not enough."
" SLOW AND DEPRESSING
",2017-12-31 00:00:00,5,"Hidden amongst life of the main character is an interesting ""Thriller"" plot. However, the alcoholism of the main character, whilst forming a part of the plot, takes over the story, slows its pace and is very depressing."
" Terrific Thriller, Terrific Acting
",2017-12-19 00:00:00,9,"I don't know how this movie only managed 6/10, I thought it was brilliant. Emily Blunt's performance worthy of an Oscar. The entire cast terrific. I was engaged and moved from start to finish. Ranks as one of the best movies I have seen in past couple of years."
" Books are Always Better than the Movie...
",2017-12-07 00:00:00,8,Luckily I did not read the book so I had no idea what was gonna happen. I loved it!!! I think it is hard to give a movie a fair review if you've already read the book. There is no real suspense. You already know what's gonna happen so you spend the entire time comparing the movie to the book and movies are only so long so you can't put in everything. Just my opinion...
" Worth Viewing Again and Again
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,10,"What do you say about a film that just might keep you wanting to view it again and again? In this case, it earns a 10. The lead actress did an extraordinary portrayal of a deeply confused woman with overwhelming challenges. What a powerhouse performance! All supporting actors are excellent. It's a suspenseful story that keeps you guessing. The film can be a little confusing because it uses flashbacks. It's so disturbing that it could remind one of Hitchcock style films. It has themes of doubt, dependency, abuse, mental confusion, tension, betrayal, lust, abandonment, fear, irony, dysfunction and pure evil. The narrative eventually weaves its way to its unexpected climax and highly satisfactory conclusion.The lead character is the glue that keeps this story together. As the revelations are exposed, you begin to truly care what happens to her and hope that she survives her ordeal. I wanted to know more about her. She's definitely, ""not the girl she used to be."""
" good mystery
",2017-11-04 00:00:00,8,"I agree with some posters that the plot was full of holes. Big ones. However, I still enjoyed ""Girl on a Train"" from 2015. I didn't read the book.Rachel (Emily Blunt) is an alcoholic who, since losing her job, spends her days going back and forth on the train past her old neighborhood. There she sees a loving couple, Scott and Megan (Luke Evans and Haley Bennett). Also in that neighborhood is the house she used to live in where now, her ex-husband Tom (Justin Theroux) lives with his new wife Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) and their new baby.Megan is actually the nanny of Anna's and Tom's new baby. One day she abruptly quits. Rachel is envious of Megan's relationship with her husband which is so loving. One day she sees Megan with another man on their porch and becomes enraged. Later on, Megan disappears. Rachel has been seen in the neighborhood, stalking Tom and Anna -- and at one point, picked up their baby and took her outside. She falls under suspicion by the detective in charge (Allison Janney) - the theory being that she attacked Megan in the woods thinking she was Anna as the two are blond and resemble one another.I really enjoyed this film and didn't find it at all boring. The acting was excellent - Blunt walks around most of the time with a dazed and half-dead look on her face, but she has scenes in flashback that are quite different. Theroux and Evans have the showiest roles and rise to the occasion. This isn't a difficult mystery to figure out, but it does keep you involved. A reviewer on this site mentioned one hole which actually didn't turn out to be one after all. The other question is, why wasn't she charged with kidnapping when she took the baby outside? I have to think it's because Anna and Tom wrote her off as a pathetic nut - and she did put the baby down. Rather than make a fuss, they didn't press charges. As to why she didn't have a restraining order - yes, major hole, because she could have had one and violated it anyway. Worth seeing."
" Surprisingly well done
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,8,"Some very good work all around, by and large. I have some reservations about the final 30 minutes in the direction, though, but not the writing. Very surprised at Emily Blunt's Rachel. Although there was the benefit of some very good material, she captured nicely the insanity of alcoholism and the anger and thinking it brings. Read some critiques that she was too pretty for the role of a drunk, which was likely true. But it's a movie and real drunks are not easy to look at. And she was not that pretty in this.The direction and presentation did not adequately clarify her lapsing in her sobriety, though.It did smack of a very well done Lifetime movie in the melodrama. Ideal pretty couple. Convenient settings and backstory with her ex-husband being on the same street. Handsome young therapist. Very much ""perfect storm"". But, in the end, I bought it. A few gender biases were displayed. The two men were very cliché, but it worked. The husband of the murdered girl was a bit unbelievable vs. his good looks. I just kept thinking that guy has other choices. The femme fatale was well drawn but still cliché in her seductiveness. But the drowned baby backstory was a valid and compassionate device. In both her and the 2nd wife, it was a good movie for men with low self- esteem to watch when they are rejected by good-looking women. Consider the source.I did guess it was the husband that was the killer. It's always the last guy you suspect throughout. But the material seemed to be a bit too permissive of Rachel and the 2nd wife's actions. No drunken man entering a house and holding a baby would be forgiven, but we were asked to be forgiving of drunk Rachel.And the 2nd wife waited not to be a compliant robot of her murderer husband when he is killed by the lead. Then we are somehow suppose to cheer that she, technically, likely finished off her husband. It was an interesting moment, but I did not stand behind her choice.And the direction of the last 30 minutes. Although the first 2/3 was adequate vs. the material, the ending needed more coverage and nuance that would have broken from the pace and look of the first 2/3. The last 30 minutes was too matter-of-fact, like it would happen in real life. There was much more there from the husband holding the baby to knocking out his first wife. Thus, I think I would have preferred it all to be in line with what the last 30 minutes needed. (And as a side note, Rachel's drunken recollection suggested to me that the 2nd wife was in the tunnel and not the femme fatale. Thus, when the sober version of such was shown to the killing, I was surprised that it was the femme fatale.)"
" Moderately interesting
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,5,"Rachel travels to and from New York each day on the train. On the way she travels past her old house, where she and her then-husband, Tom, used to live. She admires his new neighbour, Megan, and her seemingly-perfect relationship with her husband. However, Rachel has problems, alcoholism being the most obvious and destructive. Plus she appears to be stalking her ex-husband, his new wife, Anna, and their baby. Then Megan disappears and, due to Megan's resemblance to Anna and Rachel's instability, Rachel is a prime suspect. Thing is, Rachel was in Megan's neighbourhood on the night she was last seen, and recalls seeing Megan, but was too drunk to remember what happened...A moderately interesting thriller / crime-drama. Plot is okay but not overly original or intriguing. Set up is a bit long-winded and a bit confusing. Plot development is a bit too obvious, with director Tate Taylor spoon-feeding information. Even at the end he doesn't know when to stop. Taylor tries to cover up for the lack of depth to the movie by adding a layer of overdone atmosphere that feels fake and often unnecessary. Considering Taylor directed the brilliant social drama The Help and the great James Brown biopic Get On Up, maybe thrillers just aren't his thing.This said, it's not all bad. While not compelling or overly engaging, there is a decent amount of intrigue, enough to keep you watching. Solid performances from a very good cast too."
" Insipid
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,5,"Based on Paula Hawkins' bestseller, ""The Girl on the Train"" tells the story of three women whose paths get intertwined by the disappearance of one of them. In the process, the movie flirts with interesting themes, such as alcoholism, marriage, and memories.First, I need to let something clear. Even though the book was highly praised and was considered by many people a terrific thriller, I found it rather weak. We notice from the very beginning that we're experiencing a whodunit story. However, the resolution of the mystery is utterly frustrating, since it is predictable and it is revealed too soon. There's a bigger problem, though: the storytelling is very problematic. We never get the sense that the story is naturally unfolding - things just happen out of the blue. What's more, the characters are, at the very best, uninteresting. Some of them are even inexplicably abandoned in the middle of the narrative. Well, since the source is that weak, it is difficult to imagine the book to be different.Director Tate Taylor doesn't ruin the movie but nevertheless takes some weird choices when it comes to camera-work. Some low-frame sequences are annoying, the different time-lines and perspectives are unnecessarily convoluted, and the rhythm is monotonous.The screenplay manages to worsen the already feeble story came from the book. Characters that were ""only"" uninteresting got completely one-dimensional. Not to mention the useless ones, such as the detectives, doctor Kamal Abdic, and the red-haired guy from the train (really, why on earth is he there?). The dialogues are poor and there seems to be a complete absence of connection between some scenes. Moreover, motivations are incomprehensible, which prevents the public from being invested in the story.Emily Blunt as Rachel gives a far better performance than the movie asks. Haley Bennett (Megan) and Rebecca Ferguson (Anna), although not that good, both are OK. Justin Theroux has the strongest performance among the men, which isn't saying much.The cinematography is pretty decent and the soundtrack, albeit not memorable, is very suitable. ""The Girl on the Train"" reflects many of the weakness of Paula Hawkins' book. More the that, it manages to be even worse. Vote: 5,8."
" Drunk fat ladies and psycho nymphos blame everything on the man
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,2,"This film reflects the worst of the new Hollywood mantra ""women and kids can do whatever they want, men don't matter"". Or the other ""It's always the man's fault""The main character is a drunk fat lady who stalks her X hubby and his new bimbo wife, then inserts herself into a murder case that has major cred problems. The bimbo wife is the type who says stuff like ""when I look into my babies eyes I feel like my heart is going to explode with love"", so caveat:some lines may induce vomiting.There is a nympho-psychopath down the street who unfortunately is very hot, so if you are a man in her life, you probably get lucky but, eventually it sucks to be YOU..... WAIT,wait, it gets better: her vagina slinging habit is blamed on , guess who? Her husband because he : abuses her? NO,....he does not love her? NO... because he WORKS TOO MUCH!!That's right, if you can't find a fault, it is abusive to be away from the house because you had to work to pay for all her crap.......The old feminist escape value ""well, he was a nice guy, but he wan't there"" (had to go to Cleveland for two days for that old continuing ed, and....The piece does not have so much of a feminist bent, as a contortion. It portrays women who lie, cheat, steal, murder; and also do what many women even revile:home wreck. Yet, the only clever thing about the the writing is that , no matter how revolting the women's behavior is (even the hot one's-who are usually forgiven anyway) , no matter how embarrassingly sleazy their selfish deeds are (eg ""I didn't enjoy the sex so much as my ability to make him COME RUNNING)-It gets all tied up neatly at the end by blaming, who else? THE MAN!!As a baby boomer I don't know what effect it would have had on me if I had grown up with male genitalia watching this kind of stuff. Would I also button my top button of my shirt uncomfortably up? Would I wrap myself in a male burka and hide in my parents basement for life? Perhaps, if you watch ""hot Tub Time Machine"" you will see what kind of ""man"" is growing into adulthood today, in the form of the tag along nephew. The flick gets two stars because the story line is a bit clever, in the way that that freshman planning on majoring in English wrote a clever short story in class. Save your money, basic cable already includes the LIFETIME network."
" Awful
",2017-09-28 00:00:00,1,"I tried to stick with it but it was unrelentingly miserable & excruciatingly boring. If there was a mystery in there somewhere I could not have cared less about solving it. The characters were forgettable & not in the least bit likable or relatable. The story was depressing and just got more depressing as it went along. If you're into tales about addicts obsessing and stalking people in a very pathetic sad embarrassing way then this is your jam. For me, I quit at the 3/4 mark wishing I hadn't wasted my time. I can't recommend this to anyone to be honest. Even fans of straight ""drama"" as opposed to thriller/mystery. Emily tried her best - but she was wasted here. Oh and there's a few familiar but older faces popping up that I hadn't seen in a while but that's not enough to suggest its worth watching."
" A Truthful look at how twisted adults can be. God save us. Amen.
",2017-09-28 00:00:00,10,"This was quite the movie. WOW. You have to be patient, because this one takes a while. For the 40's over crowd to really appreciate. People are so crazy by then, you don't know what is going on with people. Young people haven't yet a clue what life can be like. It takes a while to understand the depth of this life, and to see how the Devil is at work; and how God saves us. Amen."
" Disappointing Hype Train
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,5,I gather this was a good read and you can clearly tell the story was written by a woman for women.Why did they decide to let a man helm the directorial seat for this film then? All in all its a mediocre film with a very wasted cast of good actors with a plot twist that you really don't care about or was there two plot twists? I'm not sure if the ending was a plot twist as it was pretty predictable by then. In essence its a movie about women ******** each other over to be with a man and that man is ******** them all over too both figuratively and literally. Its the kind of thing you can find on cinema-screen on daytime TV and is the underlying plot to most bad daytime American soaps.The whole film has that whole 50 shades of grey vibe to it; it will appeal to you if you are a repressed woman frustrated with life or still hate filled due to the umpteenth man who has ****** you over in your life.If you are indeed more of the masculine type then I strongly recommend avoiding this film like the plague as it will bore you to tears.All in all the film does little to alleviate stereotypes about women in the modern world and paints a very dim view of them indeed in this film. Men are of course and always will be bastards so nothing unexpected to discover in this film about men either.

Its a STELLAR Performance that leaves you in awe. And sadly enough, Blunt's career best performance in stuck in this derailing Mystery/Thriller called 'The Girl on the Train'. This slow-moving picture never soars & even the nail-biting end can leave no major impact. Blunt keeps you going, though!'A Girl on the Train' Synopsis: A divorcée becomes entangled in a missing persons investigation that promises to send shock-waves throughout her life.Erin Cressida Wilson Adapts Paula Hawkins' 2015 debut novel of the same name, but her Screenplay is mostly devoid of tension. And that for any thriller can be a big problem. While the first-hour is steadily low, the second-hour does have some absorbing moments & the culmination, when the real culprit is reveled, is indeed engaging, But alas, its all too far & between. Tate Taylor has the knack of a fine storyteller & the director scores best when the suspense gets meaty, but otherwise, he seems to be capturing shots & characters, without much effect.Ultimately, This one's a letdown and yet I'd tell you to watch it for Blunt's superior act.

" A very descent mystery thriller
",2017-09-03 00:00:00,9,"I didn't have any particular expectations for 'The Girl On The Train' due to the quite low rating from both the audience and critics but what I saw made me rethink whether or not I should take the rating under consideration. It was a great looking film with a very talented director and cast, especially Emily Blunt gives an Oscar worthy performance making you feel the emotions of the main character something that is quite important for this particular movie. The script introduces the three main characters and wraps up quite nicely giving the audience a very good viewing experience and making it easier for everyone to follow the plot. I haven't read the book so I can't judge if it's a good adaptation or not but one think I can say confidently is that I really enjoyed it and I believe that the lovers of the genre are going to love it too!"
" disjointed
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,5,"Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt) rides the train passing her former married life in her beautiful house. Her former neighbor Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett) goes missing and police detective Riley (Allison Janney) interrogates her. She is a drunk haunted by her former life. Her ex-husband Tom Watson (Justin Theroux) lives in her former house with his new wife Anna Watson (Rebecca Ferguson) and baby. Her former neighbor Megan lives with her husband Scott (Luke Evans). She uncovers devastating lost memories from her life with Tom.The flow is disjointed and the slow reveal leaves me bored. There is a great cast here but it only gets compelling during the harrowing climax. Overall, it plays as a muddled melodrama that doesn't grab me until the end. It needs some more danger in the present time to enliven the drama but it is more like a bunch of boring flashbacks."
" Distinctly average feminist clap trap...
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,4,"Could have been interesting but descended into formulaic and by the book feminist murder mystery. I think the woman who wrote this is certainly a Misandrist for absolute certainty. Dont really blame her as 90% of men are complete shits and no mistake!What is it though with these women writers and their need for explicit and outrageous sexual exploits (Shades Of Grey etc) - are they really that bored.
Women these days never really seem to know what they want and when they get what they want they change their minds - a bit like this movie.It was well directed and Emily Blunt was superb as usual but it was too easy to figure out and the feminist claptrap left me cold!I figured out who the killer was after 30 minutes and if you can do that then that shows the movie for what it is. No, not in this one - although Emily Blunt is superb as always she just cannot make up for what is a pretty boring, lifeless script and the seemingly ever prevalent feminist bash at men - is it just me or are you finding this constant man-bashing in movies a bit of a bore.Men are from Venus and women are definitely from Mars if this movie is anything to go by!"
" Bold. Brutal. Beautiful.
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,8,"'The Girl on the Train' is the modern equivalent of a monumental novel. Its simplicity mirrors the simplicity of the modern age. The work-home-sleep pattern reigns the day and there is no place for thought, or foresight in it. The same happens to the characters in the film. Apart from the title girl, the only outcast in a highly organized, civilized society, all the characters are stuck in a vicious circle of work, dubious relationships, and reactionary behaviors. All are dissatisfied in one way, or another, and all cause other people pain although most of the time the hurt is unintentional. Caught in the whirlwind of everyday life, they don't have time to think of their own wants and needs, let alone other people's. Everyone is just too busy and too respectable. 'Respectability' seems to be the key which unlocks the film's themes. Without giving too much away, let me say that the people commanding the most respect and having the most authority end up being the most depraved while the seemingly unreliable ones turn out the most humane. Emily Blunt's stunning, haunting performance turns the film into an experience. Her character's fragmented reality becomes an entrancing journey to watch and once all the pieces fall into place at the end, it feels as if we've discovered a truth, or found an answer to an important question. The ending is not forced. to the contrary, it provides a closure and feels like a relief which, in turn, makes the experience worthwhile. Additionally, the film is effortlessly shot. Contrary to the earlier thriller and horror classics, such as Hitchcock's 'Vertigo,' or 'Psycho,' the combination of close-ups and long shots strikes a balance, so the spectator doesn't feel overwhelmed by the slightly anxiogenic subject 'The Girl on the Train' deals with. The quick pace along with the increasing number of conflicting pieces of evidence keep you at the edge of your seat until the very end. The use of flashbacks add realism and give insight into Rachel's mind. It's filmmaking at its best. Tate Taylor does not take the possibilities that new technology affords for granted and makes sure he uses them with caution and as a means to an end. The story-telling is pushed to the forefront and the format merely compliments it. Considering that the film is based on a best-selling novel, it can be said that it traces a cultural trend. And if this type of story is celebrated by both readers and spectators then I must say, I'm happy to be living in this day and age."
" Rise up
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,8,"Actually the movie wasn't that bad what i expected.First of all I've read the book,which is marvelous. I was finishing the book when the trailer comes out . I was really curious about what they are going to make . In my mind I have made my own character looking , expressions , personality , it was good to see how other peoples looks like this . The producer has made good job . The actress has made amazing job! I'm appreciate that . Sometimes I've missed something in the story , sure , they can't make the whole story,because the time. The time.. It happened to me when i lost in time . I didn't know where are we in the story."
" The mystery man and the gone girl!
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,7,"It is one of those films that I thought I saw everything from its trailer. Not just me, many others said the same. Those we were never read the original source. Yes, it was based on the book of the same name. I really liked it. Unpredictable, but once it reveals its secret, it feels so simple that we'd missed. Straightforward storytelling. No flashbacks. Great characters, but that's where the story had a strong grip. Especially when the suspense unveiled, you might say all the earlier events were in the wrong direction, which were intentionally done to divert viewer's envision.An alcoholic woman who daily takes the train to work, witnesses out of the window a woman happily married and living the life of her dream. When one day she sees a mysterious man with her, the tale takes a twist. Following the suspense, what she finds and how the film ends are the remaining part. Emily Blunt was very good. There are other characters, but it was Emily's story, told from her perspective. Recognisable role with an award, but the film's theme was an adult. Not like sexual exploration, but the basic outline was drawn out of such concept. One of the finest crime-mystery in the recent time, so surely worth a watch.7/10"
" Ickkk !!!
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,1,Horrible chick flick. Guys stay away from this one. A bunch of Debbie Downer vignettes make this hugely depressing. It's hard to follow. No car crashes. Psycho drama. Self-indulgent behavior on celluloid. I am so sick of this bull. This is what's wrong with the world: bad behavior glorified on the screen.
" What's all the fuss about?
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,3,"THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is another example of a massively popular movie that's been generally raved about by critics and viewers alike, but a film that leaves me cold. I really can't see what all the fuss is about for a movie like this. The story is about a bunch of cold, unlikeable characters and it seems to be a case of who does what (or did what) to whom. Attempts at mystery and atmosphere fall flat and the whole thing becomes convoluted about 20 minutes in, piling on the flashbacks and reveals but utterly failing to entertain at the same time. I loved Emily Blunt in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA but she really feels out of her depth in more meaty fare, failing in LOOPER and now this. I don't care if she's had all her make-up scraped off and cries and swears a lot, this isn't my definition of good acting."
" Hollywood at its best
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,3,"This movie really highlights the problem with Hollywood. You have a decent book and Hollywood really butcher it. There are so many details in the book that are left out for no apparent reason other than perhaps to deliberately make the characters seem less human. And they've added stuff that is really poorly written. Add that together with a cast that are more for selling tickets than they actually make sense for the characters and you end up with a really bad movie. Granted, some of the actors do a fine job with the script they've gotten. This is akin to those bad remakes that Hollywood does over and over again. Don't see this movie, spend the money on the book instead."
" Biggest Surprise was my own Bias
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,8,"You've seen the movie because why else would you read a review of a mystery with a spoiler alert? I realized how readily I was willing to cast suspicion on the women characters, as though the men were innocently responding to the craziness of the women. Halfway through I happily suspected Anna of setting Rachel up. When Megan cheated, I judged her harshly. But silently forgave the psychiatrist as being weak,but only because he was susceptible to her womanly wiles. (Even though, he's doubly culpable by exploiting a patient's vulnerability). He wasn't to blame. But even when Anna was in the bedroom saying how she sometimes wished they were still having an affair, and we were reminded that HE was the cheater in his marriage to Rachel, it was still Anna whose behavior was unpalatable. Tom's never entered my mind as blameworthy. That's why it was surprise when we find out that Tom is the perpetrator of the misery of all 3 women. The writer, and director were relying on this bias to exist in their audience, or it wouldn't have worked at all. Maybe in the not too distant future, people will watch this movie as an example of how deeply our biases are entrenched in men and internalized by women."
" Just about watchable 6/10
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,6,"The girl on the train (2016) - Having heard good things about the book I watched this fully expecting a real gripping thriller, but i was wrong. It is very slow and boring for the first part of the movie and takes awhile to get into something worth watching.. Its a good story with an exciting plot but just didn't work for me. Nevertheless it was watchable and enjoyable in parts but failed to excite me like a thriller/mystery should."
" Stylish
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,7,"A hopeless drunk interferes with the family of her ex-husband, then a beautiful neighbour goes missing and the secret lies in a drunken blackout.Superior murder mystery with strong performances. This is quite bleak, with every character flawed by some degree of deception or weakness, and the mood is grim without the flamboyance of a film noir. The pace is steady, and everything clicks into place as the climax is ushered in through flashbacks. About halfway through I was comparing it to The Dead Girl, but it didn't maintain the quality.The outstanding element is the lead actress playing a really pitiful drunk who seems doomed to waste her life away - really depressing, with all those gloopy-eyed close ups. Other cast members are good, although it's a mystery why Laura Prepon took such a small role.Music is gloomy and clinical, reminded me of the theme to House Of Cards. Photography is crisp, and the direction tells the story well.Overall: conventional story told with style."
" Running Low on Selections? This is Definitely Worth Watching
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,7,"A slow paced movie; hence, being almost 2 hours long. It strings you along, keeping you wondering what will happen next (up until a certain point.) I was not extremely excited about the way the movie came to an end, but that's because I was so into it, completely committed. Yet, the ending just didn't do the rest of the movie justice. However, I have watched so many movies, I was hard up for something that interests me. I dug this up, and wasn't disappointed...its worth watching."
" The grass is greener on the other side - especially is you're looking at it from afar.
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,8,"Warning: may contain spoilers. As struggling alcoholic Rachel rides aimlessly on her Manhattan bound train, she passes by the same homes and stares woefully at the lives she imagines the inhabitants must lead. One of those homes is the one she once shared with her ex husband, who left her due to her drinking. Inhabited by his pretty new wife and their baby, Rachel can't help but feel envious of the life that could have been hers. The other is shared by a young couple who she imagines have the perfect love. There's a sad longing as she watches from behind the glass, eyes red and glassy from the previous nights binge. She lives through these strangers, having given up on her own life as she drinks from a water bottle concealing vodka on her way to a job she lost a long time ago. Rachel views from a distance - and that distance conceals the cracks, blurring the hidden realities of the lives she covets. Her ex husband is cheating on his new wife, as he did to her. The perfect young couple aren't as perfect as it would appear, their relationship riddled with secrets and despair. Rachel yearns for the husband and the life she once had - but was that life as good as she remembers? Are her memories tainted by the alcohol? Emily Blunt is flawless as the downtrodden, regretful alcoholic who has lost her life and her dignity. Always drunk and muddled in her thoughts, it's hard to distinguish between fact and drunken fantasy. She's a passenger on the train just as she is in her own life - can she eventually take control of the journey or is she doomed to ride out her life in a booze-fueled blur? As she gets closer to the people she once viewed from a distance, Rachel manages to get a grip on reality for long enough to unravel the mysteries of their lives - and her own."

The acting, (Emily Blunt) was amazing, we felt her negative energy through her character, as for (Haley Bennett) who showed a very solid performance, as for (Luke Evans) he wasn't so good in his character, (Justin Theroux) was the impressive one in his character."

",2017-05-20 00:00:00,7,"Although it is a bit slow and silent, this movie still kept me wondering what's gonna happen next. I've read the book, by the way. And I appreciate the adaptation. Only I was a bit disappointed that Rachel is not as fat as I read in the book. However, Emily Blunt is amazing as always. Her eyes really a perfection for the role. The cast are mostly perfect. But I was not quite satisfied with the cast of Justin Theroux at first. In the end, I liked him as Tom. He suit the role, seriously."
" The First Boring Thriller
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,5,"Wow. This was one of the few movies I've ever watched that hasn't even been able to hold my interest. There's way too much going on in the beginning and once you get to the end you find that must of the stuff they were dumping on you, in the beginning, was completely useless. Ultimately, in the end, once the conclusion is reached, you find it to be really unsatisfying. I couldn't careless at that point though anyways. 5/14/17"
" Days of Wine and Railroads
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,7,"This film unfolds in a way that is clearly sourced from a superior book, but that doesn't make the film bad. Unlike an author who can devote paragraphs to psychological detail, a filmmaker must find abbreviated ways to get inside a character's head. Emily Blunt's performance as the alternately sedated and explosive Rachel is by far the film's highlight. The other leads all have their moments, but mostly stick to clichés.The most glaring downside (for me) was that the police detectives seem far more interested in melodrama than forensic science."
" Great Movie
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,9,"I've been on IMDb for longer than I remember but rarely write reviews of a film but have watched thousands of movies in my life but after seeing reviewers stating this was a terrible movie I feel I had to post my opinion.For starters, I haven't read the book and probably never will so I went into this without knowing much about it except that the ""girl"" was a woman named Rachel who was an alcoholic and rode the train. As the story unfolded I was hooked and like many had suspicions of who the murderer was but kept changing my opinion. At first it seemed like Rachel was going to be arrested for the murder even if she didn't do it. Then other possible suspects unfolded but soon those were found not to be case and at the end it all came together. This held my attention to the end like few films nowadays do and although it had a slow start. But once the girl went missing it picked up and I was hooked.Yeah, not a lot of action and not the best acting I've seen over the years but something about it just grabbed me and kept all my attention for about the last 75%. Rent the DVD and watch it, you'll love it."
" Turgid, depressing, without merit
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,3,"This film is hard work.The first problem is that none of the characters are relateable or sympathetic. I just don't care for anyone. Books often give you insight into people's minds, so inevitably when you put something like this into a movie you end up with lots of self-aware and overly exposition-laden dialogue.Girl on the Train - for a film that is titled this, has very little on the train. I know this seems an odd complaint, but it seems like a plot device for about five minutes. There's no follow through. She rides past a couple of times, but this is undermined by the fact that she lived on the street. It should be called The Girl Who Lived Two Doors Down.The plot points are pretty predictable: case in point pregnant woman dies. We know two people who aren't the father. Hmm who could it be. Could it be the only other male actor in the film? Oh yes it could! What a motive eh for murder? Didn't see that coming.The main plot twist - which incidentally was delivered by a woefully underused Lisa Kudrow - is delivered flat, and provides no exciting moment for the film. It's ""Oh here's the twist... now everything will be black and white... man bad, women can murder because man deserved it... the end."" Having the second woman literally drive the corkscrew home then going in the police interview ""She was right all along viewers - totally innocent!"" sums up the subtlety of this movie. Just a mess really, an unlikable turgid mess."
" A thrillerish-drama or a 2-hour soap opera
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,6,"The only two things that made me watch this movie were the(fooling) title and Emily Blunt. I've been a fan of hers for a long time and although I'm more of a fan of action, thrillers and horror, Emily and the title lured me into this.The acting is spot on, no complaints on that front, but as for the rest, mainly the story, it's a waste of nearly 2 hours. If you do venture into watching this for whatever reason, be prepared to get bored.I would only recommend this to someone if they were a big fan of soap operas and Emily Blunt. If you don't fit into either category, you are likely to be bored to death before this reaches its final climax by the last 15 minutes.Unless you're a big Emily Blunt fan and like thriller-drama stories(leaning more toward the soap opera style), then don't waste your time."
" Travelling
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,8,"Sometimes you drift off and don't remember how you got where you are. Now imagine that happening quite often to you. Now also imagine weird things happening during your blackouts. Your voyage would not seem that innocent anymore now would it? Also you would have quite a few problems you would have to deal with.The cast is amazing in this one. Especially the female talent at hand is mesmerizing with very powerful performances. And I like where they take it if you'll excuse the pun. The suspense is really high and I was really into the whole story. When you mean well, but kind of have a touch to make things worse ... It's a thriller alright"
" ""I don't think you're helping anybody.""
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,8,"I'm surprised at the relatively low rating for the picture and the visceral reaction of some of the negative reviewers. I thought this was a tightly scripted story with a plot that keeps one guessing as to the underlying motivations of it's principals. The initial treatment of Emily Blunt's character gives one the impression that mental illness may be involved along with the frequent tipping of the bottle. As the story progresses, details emerge that turn the story into a murder mystery with the attendant pointing of fingers at suspects both likely and unlikely. When the slime-ball Tom (Justin Theroux) got what he deserved from an enlightened Rachel (Blunt), it was a stand up and cheer moment, made even better by wife Anna's (Rebecca Ferguson) reenactment of the scene in ""The Godfather"" when Sonny Corleone had to get that one last kick into his brother-in-law's side. Classic, and pretty much the way I'll remember this movie whenever I hear it mentioned."
" The Girl off the Train, and on the Rails.
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,8,"From the very moment Emily Blunt stammered her first words, I was immediately hooked, curious and engrossed. Emily blunt is another actor that knows what the hell she's doing, and in this film her talent is flaunted. I absolutely love how full circle this film went... Perhaps like the very train Rachel was digesting in. From good, to bad, to better than before.I believe Tate Taylor did an excellent job at disguising Tom's involvements, especially given that, once one sees Tom with Anna, you could pretty much connect the dots, but Tate made Rachel's blurs, our own, and threw in a spanner by introducing the Psychiatrist.I love the way the story was told. It was a constant resuscitation, that also kept the mystery alive. Megan's tragedy was, so incredibly ghastly that, it gave the whole story and plot, an extra pair of lungs. Anna too, for a moment evokes such frustration in me, that contributes to the film.Rebecca and Haley were also so very stunning, but Emily, so effortlessly, stole the show, like she was supposed to.The Girl on the Train was constantly on track. Though arguably predictable, it never derailed and progressed with full steam. A sober 8/10."
" Basically Tiring
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,7,"I hope the novel moved faster than the movie. The plot was a good one and the ending a twist with plenty of characters to consider as the ""villain"" until the real one is revealed, but it was so S*L*O*W*. In places, the continuity seemed as wobbly as Rachel's drunken gait, and I got so very tired of seeing close-ups of her wide-eyed, stricken face. Eventually, I simply found myself wondering when the whole thing would be over.The plot: Rachel (no ""girl"" by any means), on a train commute fantasizes about a couple she sees everyday as she passes her old neighborhood, with memories of her broken marriage mixed in. The couple seem very much in love so when she see the wife on her balcony appearing to kiss another man, she feels it's her duty to tell the husband. Shortly afterward, the wife goes missing and Rachel tries to discover what actually happened as she struggles to piece together her memory of that night as well as other fragments of her life.There are plenty of questions left unanswered in this story, mainly: If Rachel lost her job a year before, how can she afford to buy all those train tickets, much less anything else? The acting is good by all, and the twists and turns unexpected, with one character after another being set up in Rachel's faulty memory as the murderer. Everyone seems transitory, however, being merely popping in to become more factors in her confusion.If there had been some way to speed up the action a bit, this movie would've be, while not enjoyable, at least entertaining. I watched this movie from a DVD but I don't think seeing it on the big screen would've made a difference. As it was, my initial reply, when asked about it, is: ""Tiring."""
" Who dunnit?
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,6,"The beginning of the movie was a little confusing as different and seemingly unrelated women were introduced. They were the main character Rachel -- an alcoholic, Tom -- Rachel's Ex husband, Anna - - Tom's new wife, and Megan -- Tom and Anna's baby sitter. I hope this makes it easier to understand.Rachel's alcoholism causes her to black out frequently and not remember what happened. And so the stage is set for a murder mystery.One person got murdered, and Rachel was involved one way or another. Unfortunately she herself couldn't recall what exactly happened. Slowly, the events came back to her little by little.The beginning of the movie was like a drama. Then when the murdered occurred, it revealed itself as a who dunnit type of movie. I had no clue who it was until the movie revealed it.Overall a decent movie."
" Blunt power!
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,7,"Director Tate Taylor went down a taylor-made cinematic arena and took an auteur ride with ""The Girl on the Train"". The movie stars a fantastic Emily Blunt as Rachel; a lonely, depressed, and alcoholic woman who rides a train everyday that passes by the house she used to reside with her ex-husband Tom. A few houses down, there is another house Rachel fixates with, it's one of a blonde woman named Megan who appears to be happily married to her husband. But Rachel is literally a trainwreck due to her lushing ways, and when she sees one day (obviously from the train) that Megan might be having an affair, Rachel goes more off her rockers but not off her Johnnie Walkers. What follows on ""The Girl from The Train"" I will leave for you to get on track with. Taylor does provide some twists & turns in this psychological thriller, but nothing that will shock you. The up-and-coming Haley Bennett does impressive work as Megan, and Rachel Ferguson was quite steady as Tom's new wife Anna. The rest of the supporting cast including Justin Theroux, Luke Evans, Edgar Ramirez, and Allison Janney needed more ""train""ing for this one. But to put it bluntly, it was Emily Blunt's ""on the right track"" performance that made this movie watchable. So don't miss your stop for ""The Girl on the Train"", but if you do, it's not the end of the world. *** Average"
" D+. Disappointing, disjointed, dull
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,5,"Emily Blunt and the rest of the cast deserve kudos. The director and writers not so much.The flash back format dispelled rather than enhanced the tension, and the dialogue particularly in the last 30 minutes of the film was distracting."
" Nice Movie with a fast script
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,6,This is one of the good movies that I have ever watched. It shows the inner feelings of people how they act and how they react in various but hard situation in their lives. However the script of this film seems too fast and sometimes it misses valuable moments without a reason. Emily Blunt has done a fair job to her character but certainty the character has not been built up to the standard. People who read the book before the movie may have different view than others. I did not read the book at all.
" My God what a dreary dull movie
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,4,This was heralded as the greatest thing since Hitchcock. Wow is that off the mark. A dull ponderous do nothing monotonous train wreck of a movie filled with characters who are either cardboard or loathsome. A tale of rich sad spoiled white girls obsessed with babies like all women of course are. Drunks and sluts and their idiot suburban husbands and the world's most unethical psychiatrist. There is no big reveal no cliché I have a split personality and didn't know I was a psycho murderer. Nothing. Just rich spoiled drunk women either getting pregnant or trying to get pregnant or stalking women who are pregnant. But pretty much it's long boring monologues about babies and pregnancy. Occasionally Emily Blunt stares off into space remembering a time she was on a bender and trying steal babies. I guess if there's any Lifetime Movie Takeaway it's that men are abusive monsters who treat women only as brims mares to pump out babies.
" Nowhere near as good as the book
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,3,"Not being an extensive reader it is somewhat unusual for me to have read a book before watching the movie adaptation. It was the case with The Girl on the Train and have to say that I found the book much more engaging than the movie. I suppose with a mystery that isn't that surprising as you already know the plot twists.One of the thing that works really well in the book is the UK setting. The whole basis of the story is very English in nature and hence works better in an English countryside. Having spent many hours gazing at the backs of houses whilst on trains the book a a very natural feel to it. It's a very English thing to do and one that really doesn't translate into American culture.Emily Blunt plays the central character of Rachel who travels on the train each day and imagines the lives that are being lived behind the houses on the side of the track. In particular she focuses on Megan and Scott who live very close to where she lived in better times. The acting and direction are fine, but there was no flare in the movie.If you have a choice of reading the book or watching the film, I'd definitely suggest reading the book. If you really hate reading then watch the movie, but don't expect anything too fantastic."

",2017-03-29 00:00:00,8,"The shrink speaks Spanish (00:47:10) and is called Kamal Abdik (00:47:23). Not impossible but odd. Neither the Spanish nor the Arabic identities make any difference in the plot.In Spanish, the shrink says ""Quiero que tu queiras mi"" which is poor Spanish and means ""I want you to want me"" which doesn't make sense in the context."
" Please give it a look
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,8,"I personally didn't read the book but I heard my fair share. The movie while very hard to replicate the book, does a really good job, in my opinion of doing just that. I don't think it could have been done much better and certainly not with a different cast. It doesn't keep you on your toes because it's pretty much a ""given"" from the first 30 minutes. It's only after that that you start to understand there is something terribly wrong or not what it seems. Trust me and stay to the end, it is well worth it. I think Emily did a wonderful job as an alcoholic, maybe at times, too well & a little sloppy. Some of those scenes could have been trimmed down. The movie is worth it."
" Betrayed alcoholic can't let it go
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,8,"The Girl On The Train is a good movie for people who like to watch mysteries, where you try to figure out what really happened. Because that's what you basically do for almost the entire movie. In the beginning it's a bit slow but still interesting to watch because you learn to know the characters, and the second half of the movie you try to solve the mystery and everybody will have his idea on what really happened. Some will have it right and some will have it wrong. And that's what's nice about movies like this one. It's intriguing, with a nice set-up, and a good ending. Emily Blunt plays the main character, an alcoholic that lost her husband due to an affair, and she has problems to get over it. She does an excellent job playing her character. We all know people like that, the betrayers and the one that got betrayed. Some get over it and some can't let it go. It's a nice movie to watch, full of twists, and good actors. I will watch this movie again in the future."
" Intensely Perplexing
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,6,"A very intriguing premise for a story. I'd admit that the suspense is well done, and the story well planned out. However, I think the marketing buildup brought my expectations up higher than it should have been. The trailer gives nothing away, and you expect something amazing, and to me, it fell a little short of that. Don't get me wrong, I still think it was a good movie, just not great. I could not relate to Blunt's character, and felt disconnected from her. Her acting was well done, but having a protagonist like that makes for a very confusing watch for readers. Basically, throughout the whole film, the audience follows along with Rachel as she tries to piece together what happened. Really quite perplexing. I did feel frustrated at some points, because it is slow to give information. The rest of the cast did their parts well too. However, because there are so many characters, it doesn't feel like the connection is there. It might be because of the heavy mood of the film that suppresses the connection, or it may be Rachel's cloudy perception. Whatever the case, a few characters seemed to be brooding with some darkness in them, which was very unsettling to watch. As well, there isn't enough depth given to the supporting characters. It seems like all the attention was given to Rachel. The overall tone of the film, is what I would describe as intense. A lot of intense emotion hidden in the shadows that reveals itself bit by bit, and then exposes itself completely at the end. The dark colors and sometimes first person shooting, helps with creating the atmosphere, and there are also a lot of close ups for Rachel, which helps us to grasp her state of mind. Overall, the premise of the story has a lot of potential, but fell short. If they had picked up the pace a little, and given the characters more depth, it would have been better."
" ""The Girl on the Train""
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,1,"I thought this movie was terrible, I read the book first and I loved it, I was eager to watch the movie after I read the book and was hoping it would be as good but I was highly disappointed afterwards. Reason I was disappointed was the setting of the movie, it was Manhattan and not London like in the book and I know the movie isn't always exactly like the book but I was hoping it were more similar. If you watched the movie without reading the book first, maybe it would be more entertaining to watch."
" This Is A Great Who Done It.
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,7,"I read some bad reviews about this film. I don't see what could be so bad about it. It wasn't as thrilling and suspenseful as ""Gone Girl"" but it worked. I'm quite sure the book is better but I really enjoyed this film. For those who didn't read the book, this is the type of film that has to be payed close attention too and where you can't miss anything, the type of films I like. To me it's a great who done it kind of film that will have the viewer thinking and wondering. Emily Blunt plays Rachel, a divorced woman who some how gets involved in a missing persons case. It sounds simple but it gets way deeper than that. Emily Blunt is perfect in this role. Her performance alone makes this film worth the watch. I recommend it."
" How good is she but the movie is wrong
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,4,"It is a film that does not finish to boot. He is counting and counting you and you have several turns but he does not get to take off.It can not be said to be a Sunday afternoon movie, because it has interesting things, but it does not turn out to be a good movie. It will surely soon be forgotten.I personally had trouble distinguishing the two blonde girls. But if it is true that I believe them all.He has a beautiful picture. It helps tell the story.It is very well set. If the rest had gone hand in hand, it would be interesting.His address does not tell me anything, well yes, he does not finish taking off.Another film that will make its box office and forgetSpoiler:Not even at the end when the two girls help each other and get rid of the husband, with what that sequence would have to make, nor does it provoke anything."
" Bleh
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,4,"The Girl on the Train was exactly what we thought it would be once the first trailer dropped - a wannabe Gone Girl. The only thing keeping this train wreck from being a Lifetime movie is that The Girl on the Train had a (recycled) plot that just barely made sense. It's still a bad plot, it just happens to make some sense, unlike the plots of Lifetime movies. However, all the actors are horrible (with the exception of Emily Blunt, since she was good in some scenes) and their characters are incredibly underdeveloped. I couldn't care less about anything that happened to the characters, whether good or bad. The editing is also awful, because at some points it looks like the editor let their kid in the room and let them play around with the footage they were in the middle of editing. I don't know what else to talk about in great detail without this becoming a spoiler review, so I'm gonna make the end of this review as bad as the ending of this movie."
" Trans-Atlantic Shift in Locale doesn't Save ""The Girl on the Train""
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,6,"I read the best-selling book ""The Girl on the Train"" by Paula Hawkins. It's pretty good. Now I've seen the movie based on the book. And it is pretty good, as well. Not bowl you completely ass over elbows good, either one. Nonetheless, entertainment that passably suffices.Emily Blunt (""Sicario"", ""Edge of Tomorrow"") is one the finest actress's of an era. Her poignant lead performance as the deeply troubled alcoholic Rachel is as genuinely affecting as it is wholly off-putting. Which, in essence, is a description that encapsulates this entire production. These are outright unlikable and alarmingly damaged characters, each of whom is either pitiable and sad or loathsome and sociopathic. Director Tate Taylor (""The Help"") has fashioned a world in which it is damn near impossible to connect with or root for anyone. Perhaps this is intentional, but it certainly doesn't serve to create an overly meaningful relationship with an audience.And I for one am sorely disappointed that the film is set in the New York City vicinity and not amongst the environs of London as in Hawkins's story. It would have been so much more resonate and interesting to have seen these scenes play out where they did on the page as opposed to where they do here in a shameless effort to pump up the commercial appeal to the American market.After all, it's not exactly as if us Yanks flocked to the theatre to catch ""The Girl on the Train"" as it was, mate."
" The Girl on the Train
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,6,"The Girl On the Train, a novel written by Paula Hawkins, was adapted into a screenplay starring Emily Blunt and Justin Theroux , directed by Tate Taylor, it was released in October of 2016. The film tells us the story of Rachel Watson, a newly divorced woman with a drinking problem. Her marriage to Tom seems to have fallen apart after she was unable to get pregnant. Rachel's daily train commute leads her past her old house, where her ex-husband, and his new wife and baby live. She is quite obsessed with watching them and a young couple next door who are the picture of love and happiness, everything she feels she lost. One morning ride on the train Rachel sees Meghan, the beautiful woman next door, out on the deck kissing someone who is not her husband. She becomes very distressed from this incident and has a night of excessive drinking. The next morning, she awakes a mess, and bloody. On the news, she learns Meghan is missing. Anna, Tom's new wife reports to the police she saw Rachel stumbling through the neighborhood, the police question Rachel. She tells them she believed Meghan was having an affair and even seeks out Meghan's husband to tell him the same. Just as the viewer is convinced Rachel killed Meghan, Meghan's body is found in the woods and then other truths become exposed. We learn the man Meghan was kissing on the deck was her therapist, Meghan was pregnant and neither her husband or her therapist were the father of the baby. When Rachel sees a wife of Tom's old boss on the train and tries to apologize for behaving badly while drunk at a party, she learns that was not the case. She begins to have flashbacks of events of her failed marriage and we learn Tom has been manipulating her for years making her believe she was in the wrong and everything was her fault. She goes to confront him, tells his new wife, he becomes very angry, admits to killing Meghan, fearing she was going to expose him as the father of her baby. Tom starts to beat Rachel, who is able to stab Tom in defense and then Anna assists in finishing him off. This murder mystery with all its twists and turns has been compared to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, although Rachel is not as crazy as Amy was from Gone Girl. Techniques used in the film include lighting, as Rachel is usually dark and gloomy, while Megan and Anna are bright and clean. On the train rides the camera angles allow us to view what Rachel sees, so we see things how she see them. When we learn at the end that Rachel's train rides were just a farce, she had been fired months before, we realize the movie really taught us nothing is quite how it seems. You really can't judge a book by its cover."
" Psychological thriller with not too much to commend it
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,6,"Had I never seen a thriller of this kind before, I guess I would have appreciated Tate Taylor's slightly Hitchcockian-sounding and even looking ""The Girl on the Train"" more than I did. After all, there is nothing wrong with the acting here, and indeed we get a really quite hard-to-watch (which in this context means effective) role from Emily Blunt as Rachel Watson, whose touch of mental instability and problems with alcohol leave her more than likely to fall prey to self-doubt. It's neat enough how our first insights into Rachel suggest she is a normal, if sensitive, woman; how this later gives way to us writing her off as unstable and troublesome; how we then begin to see her in a more sympathetic light - as a victim, before passing through two further metamorphoses as the film progresses towards its end. That's a clever portrayal, and in the hands of an actress as talented as Blunt, we see something quite persuasive.But a problem here is that there are not really too many fellow cast members here to help her - and the film - along. And the film as a whole seems a bit lacklustre. It's not quite pretty enough, or scary enough, or different enough, or innovative enough to catch the eye, and the primary conclusion it builds to is that the wealthy upper middle-class have their problems, like the rest of us; but are also more than capable of bringing many a problem on themselves, particularly when they fall prey to a mix of unrestrained power-madness, greed and lust.If I could give this piece 6.5, rather than 6, I would do so. But I can't quite bring myself to click 7..."
" Episodic, poorly paced and uninteresting for large portions of its running time
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,3,"Divorcée and alcoholic Rachel (Emily Blunt) catches the train to New York each day and the route takes her right past her old house where her ex-husband Tom (Justin Theroux) and his wife Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) are now living. Megan (Haley Bennett) lives in one of the neighbouring properties and Rachel notices Megan when she passes each day on the train. Megan goes missing but Rachel believes that she may know what has happened to her - although she was heavily intoxicated when she last saw Megan. Rachel frantically struggles to remember what happened to Megan and does her best to assist the authorities in their investigation.It's hard to imagine how a film that has so much intrigue and mystery 'on paper' at least could end up being so drab and boring?. If you want to know the answer to this question then you'd need to watch The Girl On The Train - although I'd strongly suggest that you take my word for it and not put yourself through any unnecessary pain.The first obvious problem with The Girl On The Train is its pacing and the general manner in which it is presented. Clearly, some time needs to be devoted to introduce the characters and determine how they fit into the story etc, but to me it felt as though the characters were introduced and then the narrative was on some kind of continuous loop - train journey, back to a character, train journey onto another character. It's all a bit tedious and episodic and I found that the film continually covered the same ground without ever really establishing any new ground. The characters themselves are bland, one-dimensional and generally unlikeable - even the protagonist is an alcoholic which doesn't exactly endear us towards her.The way the film is structured was also muddled and confusing and at times it was hard to know whose perspective the story was been told from. Even as a mystery film it never really gripped me as I didn't find any of the characters to be engaging or interesting and the convoluted way that the story was structured only help to increase my general disinterest in what was going on.There are a couple of good things about this film; 1) Emily Blunt - she was a class act here and was wholly believable as a dispirited alcoholic. 2) Things pick up in the final third, but this burst of energy still fails to make up for its numerous shortcomings and as it stands the repetitive and tedious narrative in the first two thirds of the film meant that as a whole the film was a bit too much of a strain on my patience."
" Doesn't make sense
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,4,"When I first started to watch the film, and until I got half way, I didn't understand what was going on whatsoever and what relevance the sex had to the film. It was only until I read what the film was about that I, only slightly, realised what was happening and what it was about."
" Great Acting in an Average Script
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,5,"I have been a movie critic for years; having just viewed this film, and having never written a review on this site, I found this one to be worth the input.It's simple: Save your money and/or your time.Seriously.This movie has a great cast and they undoubtedly perform to the best of their abilities (Blunt is amazing as always). Unfortunately, the script is barely average and does the book minimal justice.Thete is very little tension throughout and you won't find yourself engaged until nearly 3/4 of the way in. I personally enjoy slow buildups in films, as long as the payoff is worth the wait. This is not one of those films.I give it a 5, as the best moments of it hover around a 6, and the lesser parts around a 4. If you find yourself with absolutely nothing on television and have two hours to kill, it won't be a total waste of your time. But, as the summary reflects, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see it and definitely would not spend any money on it."
" Acting is good but directing is not.
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,6,"You struggle to know what is going on every scene until the movie ends leaving you with the disappointment.I love plot twisting movie, but this ""Mystery and Thriller"" genre doesn't really twisting anything. You already expect that to happens.On the final scene you don't really feel anything, no sympathy no empathy. It's just flat ending and you want to go home, you don't even want to think about any scene from the movie.The acting is the only key that saves this movie from a complete disaster. Emily Blunt delivers really well on her character, even in this disastrous major plot-hole and awful directing."
" Horrible, Americanized version of a mediocre British thriller...
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,1,"... by stripping out all the local, English detail, this travesty has taken any and all atmosphere out of the original material.The ludicrously gorgeous Hollywood stars, gigantic houses & idyllic location are in complete contradiction to the novel's relatively downbeat, average characters and generic terraced streets: things Brits could actually relate to but doubt anyone in the US could.Pandering to the Americans' love of 'Dallas' lifestyle tropes, one that is coated in a sickly 'aspirational' money & bling based veneer, superficial and trite, made this positively stomach churning.Perhaps if one hadn't read the novel first, this might do as a time-filler for Lifestyle-porn addicted aficionados. If said viewers then read the novel afterwards however, I suspect they'd be horrified by the lack of stunning designer interiors, gym-honed bodies and perfect teeth.Disappointed in the usually excellent Emily Blunt too (and what is that accent supposed to be? Not even Mid-Atlantic. Sub-Atlantic maybe LOL?)..."

" Neat mystery. Excellent multilayered characters. Great story.
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,8,"First off, book snobs just move along. You have about the same value as the Academy Award Panel and most uppity movie critics that like the same type of movies or actors every year. There are approx. 400 (give or take) pages in a novel allowing authors to expand more on their vision. I applaud great authors. Screen writers and directors have to take their ideas cut a lot of stuff out (hence, the evolution of director's cuts of movies The also have to battle with production companies if the film goes over 2 hours, for bid 3. and We all have heard for decades ""how much better the book is than the movie"". You're opinion and it deserves to be in your book chat room not on IMDb (Internet MOVIE Data Base) on such a nauseating frequency. We get it. But most of us on here Love MOVIES. We even may read a book, too and enjoy it. But let's compare movies for their merit on film making to include acting, directing, storytelling-screenplay, production, etc. And with that being said if we only read books we wouldn't get to enjoy the artists that act, the writers that can map out a screenplay and script, a director that can set an atmosphere, ad so on. OK, so now back to the MOVIE. This was a drama with a mystery that built along. I enjoyed that as it wasn't your typical ""whodunit"" mystery from the get go but built on the why, how, and the who a it went along. The multilayered characters drawn out by actors Emily Blount, Justin Theroux, and Haylie Bennett were done in subtle, believable, and stellar fashion. The supporting cast Luke Evans (never a disappointment), Laura Prepon (stepping far away from that 70's show), Edgar Ramirez ( a stellar actor in his own right with each role he plays), and Rebecca Ferguson all do a fantastic job. The story, which some considered slow, I believe was purposefully paced to build to a climactic ending. This did not appear to ever be intended to be a fast paced action thriller by any means. The pace worked great with the atmosphere built. Unless you read the BOOK or someone told you it's pretty difficult to figure everything out before the end, and I usually guess most by the mid-point aggravating my family and friends. This was different and refreshing. The mystery truly unfolds like a good page turner (for any of you book snobs still reading this). If you are in the mood for a toned-down pace of a mystery thriller with a lot of little things to look and listen for along with great acting watch this one on that day. If you want high action or horror (which is actually my favorite genre) this isn't for you today. And if you want to read a BOOK by all means do so. Just don't tell us how much better than the movie it was. WE KNOW!!!"
" Fan's of the novel should be satisfied, but that's about it.
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,6,"The Girl on the Train is the adaptation of Paula Hawkins' thriller mystery book of the same name. It tells the story of Rachel Watson (Blunt), an unemployed alcoholic who recently divorced from her husband Tom (Theroux), now married to his new wife Anna (Ferguson). Rachel rides the train every day and passes a house with a seemingly perfect couple, Megan (Bennett) and Scott (Evans), she will sometimes make stories about them and dream about them because it was the life she lost. However, one day she sees Megan having an affair, then the next day she goes missing. Rachel thinks she saw her from the train but her alcohol induced blackouts make her an unreliable narrator in this murder mystery that is really more of a melodrama, wanting to be like Gone Girl but turning into a Lifetime Original Movie.First and foremost Emily Blunt is truly exceptional in the role of Rachel, her character is very sympathetic even as someone who has done supposedly terrible things while inebriated. She elevates the movie when it slows down, and in this movie, that happens a lot. Even though her character is supposed to ugly and fat in the book, she pulls the off alcoholic persona masterfully. Haley Bennett is also relatively good as Megan. There were a lot of layers to her character, and she did a great job translating her to screen, however everyone else is aggressively average. Ferguson, Theroux, Janney, Evans are all talented actors, however come off as one- dimensional and serve as plot drivers, their acting is good, however there is no substance to their characters. The book sets up an intriguing thriller mystery, using the unreliable narrator trope to its advantage, however this does not translate well to film. The book uses an unreliable narrator by cutting between 3 first person narrators, with Rachel driving the story, Megan driving the background and Anna hammering down the twist ending. The film ignores Anna's story, and only gives a fraction of the screen time to Megan's while Rachel will get most of the spotlight, effectively driving both the story and attempting to hammer down the twist ending. There are parts that are well crafted, there are some true moments of suspense, one scene involving a tunnel, one involving a cell phone and another involving Lisa Kudrow, however they are few and far between, surrounded by moments of Rachel being drunk and unintentionally messing up lives. The Girl on the Train wants to be intriguing, it wants to be suspenseful, however it does not have the right camera-work, the right film score, or even titillating dialogue to jump-start an enthralling premise.The film wants to be Gone Girl, the book even compares itself to it, however it does not have Atticus Ross or Trent Reznor as composers, Jeff Cronenweth as a cinematographer, nor does it have David Fincher as a director. The directing in this movie is very flat, there are some scenes that could have been suspenseful, for example near the beginning there is a drummer. If they continued his drum-roll throughout the entire scene while Rachel was in a drunken stupor, that would put me on the edge of my seat, however there was no score for that scene and I remained unfazed. There is also another fight scene at the end of the movie, where two characters face off against the main antagonist, it is filmed and directed so sub-par, what could be gripping turned into boring. Also the cinematography in this film is way below average, and I am the kind of person that would not pay attention to that. Scenes in broad daylight look impressively dull, scenes indoors look very dim and grey, while scene at night don't even look that dark.In the end, I wanted to enjoy the film even when it was getting mixed reviews, I thoroughly enjoyed the novel, despite a number of plot conveniences and nothing really to think about at the end. The novel was suspenseful when it wanted to be and it had more fleshed out characters and villains. Its a faithful adaptation of its source material, the only large difference is its location change and the portrayal of Rachel. So if all you are looking for is faithfulness you will not be too disappointed, if you're looking a well directed, mystery with an unreliable narrator, great, deceptive characters and a chilling atmosphere, I would suggest David Fincher's Gone Girl or Bryan Singer's the Usual Suspects."
" This is a movie about men and misogyny
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,10,"This is a perfect example of what women went through in our society. Who rates this movie with less then 10 stars needs to think about a thing or two. The brutality of what men can do. And please, I'm not talking about (only) murder, I'm talking about abuse, hate and emotional control. It's scary, but this novel shows, within an intense drama taken to extreme proportions, the power of men in our society and their control over women. Incredible. Sad, but incredible."
" Unwatchable for me.
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,1,"I started watching this with some hope it would be a good thriller. After about 20 minutes I gave up.The characters are just plain nasty, worried about the trivia in their lives it would seem and it was so boring that I just gave up on it.It is not often I give up on a movie, but I was in grave danger of falling asleep and kept looking around the room for something else to do other than watch it.I had sympathy for none of them and kept saying to myself, for cripes sake get a grip and get back to living your life instead of drinking constantly, having ridiculous fantasies about someone else' life, and looking at everything so bleakly."
" Staid melodramatic domestic thriller
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,5,Emily Blunt is really good in this but she's not believable because of the character she's playing. Without the schlumpy overweight sad-sack of the book there's no reason to believe a woman like Blunt would still be obsessing over some loser guy unable to move on with her life. I would have liked to see Allison Tolman in this role.The whole unreliable narrator aspect is the only interesting part of this otherwise it's all overheated nonsense that doesn't come together in a very interesting fashion. Most of it is a staid melodramatic domestic thriller. And it's all kind of sexist. Every woman's issues have to do with baby-related drama and how weak-willed they are when it comes to men.
" A Formula Film Based On Unsustainable Source Material (i.e. Gone Girl Clone)
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,3,"When I read the novel version of ""Girl On The Train"", I thought it was a decent read though relying on a lot of ""smoke and mirrors"" to hold audience interest. I actually thought it might make a better movie. I can't say that was the case in this adaptation, however, which turns out to be rather unexciting and bland.For a basic summary, ""Girl On The Train"" tells the story of Rachel (Emily Blunt), who commutes on a train through a residential area. Each day, she gazes out the window and acts as a sort of voyeur into the lives of the houses along the tracks. You see, she used to reside in one of those houses with ex husband Tom (Justin Theroux), who now is married with child to Anna (Rebecca Ferguson). Rachel, a raging alcoholic, can't quite let that past go, even confronting the pair multiple times. One day, while on her train, Rachel sees a rather strange occurrence a few doors down involving beautiful neighbor Megan (Haley Bennett). A missing persons investigation is begun, and all parties seem to have something strange going on related to the case.The main problem with this movie is that, contrary to my thought after reading the book, it can't duplicate the trickery of the printed page. The book had a cliffhanger ending nearly every chapter, so even when things got confusing it provided enough ""OMG"" moments to keep turning the pages. While the movie streamlined things and actually made the main plot easier to understand, it took away much of the drama. Essentially, the book relied on trickery that the movie couldn't duplicate. When the story is told ""straight though"", if you will, it loses a lot of its gusto.I would also consider ""Girl On The Train"" to be a rather odd, uninspiring movie in the way it deals with its characters. Besides Blunt's Rachel, the male and female characters are all the same. Tom and therapist Kamal (Edgar Ramirez) are cut from the same cloth, while Ferguson and Bennett are so close visually that it sometimes takes a keen eye to keep them straight. One would think that a story featuring a number of potentially-interesting characters would do more to differentiate them.A final personal observation: As a male, I had a really hard time identifying with the anxieties of the film. This is a very female-focused film, which isn't a bad thing by any means (probably should be more of those around, to be honest). It's just that this movie (as oddly bland as it is) really relies on the viewer to buy into the fears of the female characters. As a male, I struggled to do that, and the acting/story/direction couldn't do it for me.In short, ""Girl On The Train"" is a ""Gone Girl"" clone that doesn't nearly live up to that predecessor. It's a half-baked mystery tale (which doesn't really amount to anything all that interesting in the endgame) filled with a cast of really pretty people. It is an adequate date movie but anyone looking for something more will likely be disappointed."
" Great acting, but I would just say it is slow
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"It got a lot of press for being bad, but I would just say it is slow. Great acting by the cast and the desire to unravel this mess kept me interested. You'll probably figure things out at the beginning of the third act, but there was an additional twist that I liked. From what I hear it is slightly different than the book at times. I think it is worth a watch if you have the flu like me."
" Good Acting BUT the book is better
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,"I liked this movie, didn't love it though. I found the book to be better actually. I will say though that the darkness that seeps through the pages of the book do translate well into the movie. Also, the actors portrayal of the characters is nicely done. I would definitely recommend the movie, but I do think many will find the book to be slightly better (and they usually are)."
" Emily Blunt is truly amazing
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,7,"Not having read the book, I arrived at the theatre with a fully open mind.For the most part I enjoyed the movie, although I felt the pace was very slow – particularly in the first half or so. I wanted more tension, to feel more suspense. However, at the same time I feel that the pace and general mood of the movie translated Rachel's frame of mind.I did feel at times that something was missing in the narrative; I wanted certain things explained or differently developed, as they did not make much sense. But overall I kept wanting to know how things played out for these three women, and how their lives interconnected, not to mention what really happened that night. When that is finally revealed I was completely taken by surprise. I had not seen it coming at all.I would like to stress out Emily Blunt's stellar performance with such a multidimensional character. Everyone else also did pretty well – Haley Bennet in particular surprised me – but Blunt's range blew me away.I wonder how something like this could be put together in a book, particularly the flashbacks. I can imagine it getting quite confusing because the narrative jumps back and forth both in time and between characters. I think all that was very well handled in the movie and provided a clear narrative with little clues hidden here and there, though not nearly enough to guess how it all ended up.I will definitely be putting this book on my to-read list in a few months or year, when I have forgotten most of what I watched. As it is, the movie was quite enjoyable and I recommend it."
" Great, Tense and Thrilling Through to the End
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,10,"Disclaimer: I have not read the book.As it is so important with any thriller: this film held its weight through the entire movie. Emily Blunt put on one of the most incredible acting performances as I have ever seen for her. It reminded me of Leonardo DiCaprio's performance in ""The Aviator."" Truly stunning.Haley Bennett and Rebecca Furguson really made a stronger name for themselves. This film is dark...very dark. They performed in such a way that gave respect to the many women that, no doubt, have found themselves in similar situations. Their roles were taken very seriously, as they had little wiggle room given how easily it would be to call out poor acting in a film like this.I also need to make mention to Justin Theroux. He and Emily Blunt play the most complicated characters in the film. Justin's character builds so well until the very end, where his character shines in such a way that roots the viewer on the edge of their seat.As far as filmography, it is generally filmed from the perspective of Rachel, Emily Blunt's character. Therefore, the film can feel either too dizzy, too still, or too sporadic at different times, given the situation and the state of Rachel. It is designed to get you into Rachel's mind, with very little narration from any other source.Keep yourself away from the spoilers and let this movie take you on a ride. As with all good thrillers, this film keeps you guessing the entire time and will earn your respect."
" Pretty good psycho movie
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,7,"Girl on the Train revolves around a girl, Emily Blount, and a train she takes back and forth to NYC each day. This girl has a problem - she's an alcoholic. She also has an obsession with her past life, her ex, who went on to re-build his life after his relationship with Blount failed.The movies focuses on 4 people: ex-husband, his new wife Amy, his ex wife Rachel (blount), and neighbor Megan. Various other characters work their way into key parts of the story too. Rachel is never sure of what is real vs what is not because her drinking led her to various blackouts. Flashbacks give you glimpses, but again, what's real vs not?The Director did a masterful job of building as much intrigue and second guessing as possible. But if you are paying attention, you start having a pretty good idea of what is going on after a certain point. Then it's just a race to the inevitable conclusion.The movie is not confusing as I've read in some comments. You are being given different theories about what is going on, and it's up to you to dig thru it all, which makes this a decent psycho thriller. Throw in a psychologist to mix things up and you start wondering even more. The movie succeeds because Blount is absolutely outstanding as Rachel. What a terrific acting performance by her - You feel all her emotions and wonder throughout what really happened, till things clear up a bit.There is some nice cinematography of the Hudson river. I loved the way the Director used the train to create snapshots of lives. It really mimics our own lives as we see bits and pieces of others, and wonder what they are doing. Very satisfying movie. Buy a ticket for the Girl on the Train, and enjoy."
" Spotting from a train
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,8,"I suppose if I'd read the book first there would not have been too many surprises left when I saw the movie, but I didn't and I enjoyed every twist and turn; especially the revelation at the end.Trains used to be front and centre in mystery movies in the 1930's, 40's and 50's – Alfred Hitchcock got a lot of mileage out of them (pardon the pun), but we haven't seen that much of them of late. It's another unexpected element that adds to this intriguing film.The story starts as Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt) observes two couples from the window of the train during her daily commute to New York. When she notices something different with one of the couples, she becomes involved in a way that reveals secrets in all their lives. I wouldn't spoil it for those who haven't read the book or seen the movie yet, but suffice to say that this is a film that goes in unexpected directions.Emily blunt is an interesting actress. She has a warm, approachable look, almost like someone you've met; but whatever her secret, it allows her to melt into her roles. We believe her character from the beginning.""The Girl on the Train"" is one of those 'is it real or is it imagined' movies. Films that do that often cheat outrageously on the logic, but ""The Girl on the Train"" doesn't do that – not too much anyway.The film is full of beautiful looking people, it's a movie after all, and has powerful performances by two other women in the cast: Rebecca Ferguson and Hayley Bennett – with a dazzling and vulnerable performance by Bennett. That her co-stars don't overshadow her shows how good Emily Blunt is.Just when you could be forgiven for thinking that the hundreds of series and movies on TV and cable would have absorbed all the original material there was in the mystery category, ""The Girl on the Train"" comes along to show that clever writers and filmmakers will always find a fresh approach to a well-worn genre."
" Dead giveaway dialogue spoils the suspense!
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,5,"It went along non linearly from the beginning to end, quite unnecessarily, perhaps many directors believe that is the formula to success in any thriller.But hell of a lot of too much of back and forth makes the screenplay jerky and keeps you confused rather than engrossed. There is a thin line in between and The director has crossed it unfortunately. But the dead giveaway piece of dialogue was when Tom tells Anna that ""Rachel did not kill Megan, She is quite harmless you know"". He says it in such a tone and body language that I immediately knew that this guy is the culprit. It just remained to be seen and how and when he gets caught. And he does. He meets his end too in a very predictable way OKey-Dokey film.. 5/10"
" This could have been great. But it is just another lame excuse.
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,3,"This contains spoilers. Read at your own peril. But read and avoid wasting your time watching.....The movie could have shown a story about a deranged, barren woman stalking her ex-husband, his new wife and their baby daughter and, in the meantime, meddling about in the ongoing investigation of the disappearance of one of his ex-husband's neighbours.That's what the movie *actually does* up to the point where we are informed that the poor woman had been bullied by her ex, during her drunken episodes, into believing she had done all sort of things.Yes. The bad guy in this predominantly female movie is....a man.They could have kept the drunken woman as the culprit and have the other women sensibly figure out what happened and apprehend her.It wouldn't make a *great* movie, but it would be a good one.As it is, the bad guy is the psychopath ex-husband. Which cannot hold with the story's innumerable plot holes and inconsistencies and makes this movie a simple victimisation/empowering story."
" Well done, complex mystery
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,7,"Well, I enjoyed this movie to the point I would watch it again to catch some of the nuances you miss during first viewing. The story is a bit complicated with several couples in overlapping relationships, but that makes it interesting. The actors are all good with real responses to the surprise events. Unveiling the main character's, Rachel, story in drunken snippets adds to the tension. Some other reviewers complain about plot points that don't make sense but, in some cases, it's because the reviewer did not understand the plot and the inter-relationships of the characters. Special credit to Emily Blunt and Haley Bennet for portraying the angst in their personal situations."
" Entertaining Mystery
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,7,"(Big Spoilers) Directed smoothly by Tate Taylor, mystery/suspense movie ""The Girl on the Train"" doesn't break any originality margins, but it nicely entertains. In the jig-saw puzzle style, Taylor has Emily Blunt, Haley Bennett, and Rebecca Ferguson in a trio of decent performances. The story could be a bit overlong, and somewhat far-fetched in some character reactions and scenes, but I enjoyed the old-school mystery. You have to swallow disbelief in the idea that Blunt's character juxtaposes her recollections of how she acts. Alcohol is a ready-made explanation for this, but anyway, if you're looking to poke holes in the story, you could. And sometimes movies don't deserve the benefit of the doubt, but I found it more fun to just watch this one. 7/10"
" Terrible slow movie
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,4,"After 5 minutes, you could tell that Emily is not a drama actress. She tries to play a drunk, but rather she looks like a dork! The good news is that that last quarter of the movie is enjoyable, the bad news is that you have to sit through the really slow first 3/4's.The movie is full with forced dialogues, has very little suspense and minimal character development. If you are tempted to watch this movie instead take a nap, play with your children, go for a walk! Absolute waste of time."
" Excellent film, the longer you live on this earth the more you realise how men are, and how deluded women can be, how vulnerable we are if we choose to love
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,10,"It was the only film I felt worthy to be watched last year. I paid my money and was not disappointed, Emily Blunt's performance was outstanding and the chauvinistic husband was like every successful male that seems to be in our society right now. I really felt and understood what Rachel was going through how manipulated she was and how her life crumbled, Meghan and how she used her looks and attributes and how she saw the only way for her also to be successful was to blackmail him and Anna hoping he had changed, and they never do scenario being played out and eventually realizing Rachel was not the problem, and feeling for her.I am glad I went to watch the film and hopefully many more will get to watch it."
" Very Disappointing
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,1,"This is one of those instances where the trailer was the best bit of the movie. No it was the only good bit of the movie. I expected a tense thriller, but instead I got a mess of a script, characters I did not care about and a director who seemed like a pervert in the way he portrayed sex scenes and nudity for no valid reason.As others have said the actors did their best with this pathetic and confusing script and weird direction, but nothing can really save this movie.I am sure we will see it in the bargain baskets and pound shops before long.It does seem that whenever critics rave on about something, it is invariably rubbish."
" Poor adaption of Paula Hawkins's excellent book
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,5,"The relocation to New York was a huge mistake suggesting the screenplay failed to realise the importance of the railway to the character in Paula Hawkins's book, a quintessentially British railway winding through residential areas on raised embankments and overlooking houses, and stopping a red signals, habitually. The film also failed to reduce Rachel to the real levels of the dangerously flawed alcoholic seemingly unwilling to demonstrate the real hazards those levels present. Overall, if you have not read the book, I would guess the film picks up, well after half way, for a reasonable finale given all other circumstances but it simply doesn't do the book any justice at any level. The acting was pretty good from the main female cast but I felt the male participants didn't resemble the characters in the book at all.A very lightweight film in so many ways which is a great shame because the book is a wonderful read. I did like the music, however.Five out of ten because the film deserves to be on mainstream mediocre circuits right now."
" A very average thriller
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,5,"An unsympathetic main character and a plodding pace didn't keep me very engaged. Emily Blunt really gives it her all, but I just couldn't get behind her character at all. It's always a shame to have such a great performance in an otherwise mediocre film. The supporting cast, however, was average at best. Seeing Lisa Kudrow in any other role is still jarring to me even after all these years removed from Friends. Obviously I have no one to blame but myself for being pulled out of the movie when she's on screen, but it still played a factor. The last 20 minutes or so of the movie were actually quite good, it's just getting there that's the problem. Probably wait for Netflix on this one."
" Acting towards a train wreck
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,5,"This is a bad movie, to the point of the viewer having to try and find the goods there might be instead of the flaws it displays.Pros: Acting is not disappointing, photography is good level. Cons: Messy timeline with arguable flashbacks, poor implementation of the screenplay to the point of having all characters look like psychotic zombies in most of their interactions. The few sex scenes are sloppy, cold and nonsense, even considering they would all eventually hate each others. Violence and gore are seldom exaggerated, or simply unrealistic and bad taste. It is also doubtful that someone will be able to find the logical reason why the main character keeps the taste for train traveling once all the evil is purged and the initial reasons emptied.5/10 for the good acting, especially Emily Blunt's.This movie is likely to contain spoilers: it will definitely spoil your experience should you seek in it something more entertaining than a mediocre accomplishment. Having watched ""The Help"" from the same director I was far from expecting such flop."
" Can be Confusing -- The Original Movie is Better
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,6,"The Girl on the Train is the story of Rachel Watson's life post- divorce. This is an American remake of what I think is a really classic thriller, that doesn't quite hold up to the original (then again remakes seldom do).Every day Rachel takes the train in to work in New York City, and every day the train passes by the house she used to live in with her ex-husband, who still lives there with his new wife and child, and being reminded of them daily obviously gives her a lot of pain. She also becomes infatuated with the couple who live a few houses down. She thinks their life must be perfect and is happy for them until one day she sees (or thinks she sees?) something horrifying happen there, blacks out and wakes up badly beaten with no memory of what happened to her. Plus she finds out that Megan Hipwell is missing.Now she has to find out what happened to Megan -- and herself -- in those lost hours.The movie is good and worth seeing but for a better movie experience check out the original!"
" What was I watching....
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,1,"I can only think people see this movie maybe because it was a book or because of all the adverts (like me) but please....please save the time to do something more useful. I had been told to maybe read the book first before watching so maybe that helps. Or maybe the book is way better I don't know but I do know this was a real pain to watchMaybe I should not review this as we did not actually watch the whole move. With our heads spinning and my wife and I looking at each other with the expression of ""WTF...."" on our faces we turned it off. But what we did see was terrible....Go watch a good movie or even a great movie with a superb true story like Hacksaw Ridge. Now that is a movie worth watching"
" Excellent Mystery Drama
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,8,"I haven't read the book, and I haven't seen Gone Girl yet (everyone seems to keep comparing this to them), and from that unbiased point of view this movie is excellent.Story is very well written, very interesting, it grips you, and the order and the pace in witch it reveals and paints things to the viewers is near perfect. Don't get me wrong, this movie is very slow, and it takes some patience, intelligence and an interest for psychology to fully enjoy how it is done. Its slow pace does not cater to a casual audience that wants some instant trills. But it still delivers a lot for mind to chew on while watching. Even after the watching. This is why I am writing this review. More on that in the end.Acting is superb, especially from 3 main actresses, but a very solid performance from the male side of the cast and from the episodic rolls. O'd only say Rachel's friend or cousin or sister who ever she is that lives with her in the time of the story is the weakest character, but a very insignificant one at that.Photography is OK, it is solid, and grim atmosphere of the movie is helped with the light chosen for filming. But it is nothing extraordinary, and it didn't tickle my photographic sensibilities. But it didn't hurt the presentation either.Sound is good, voices and dialogues are well intelligible and music is subtle enough, that it helps the atmosphere without the viewer even noticing it.I could say this film is well directed and well cut and there is nothing more to add to that statement.There is ONE THOUGHT this story tickles that is (I think) not even intended by the book writer, or the movie crew. This is the thought that there is something fundamentally wrong with how in these contemporary times both genders look on marriage, sex, family and kids. While superficial look would suggest that this story is about domestic abuse, there is an another very clear picture painted. It is especially well described how 2 very ordinary white privileged women, from England (originally in the book) or from US (in the movie), look at relationships with men, what they want from their husbands and lovers and how they want their life to look. And there is one lost girl, very sexy, lost in a maze of different feeling, and different lovers so much that she is absolutely not in charge of her destiny, I'd say, even before a huge tragedy that shaped her. 3 ordinary contemporary women. And 3 of their ideal men, that not just can't make them happy, but make them tragically incapable of tackling life, and horrendously abuse them to the end.I can tell you I was not surprised this story was originally written by unmarried, childless white woman in her early forties, that after growing up in Zimbabwe came to study in England and attended Oxford.This move will make you think of an alternative view of sex, relationships, marriage, family and kids. Any but this 3 women's view."
" Twisty turny brilliance
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,9,"An avid movie watcher with high standards but this is the first time I felt compelled to write a review. I occasionally browse over reviews once I finish a movie to see what others thought, and maybe be filled in on subtle details I may have missed.I was however disgusted reading a variety of reviews here of shallow minded people that not only put pieces of the puzzle incorrectly together, but couldn't appreciate the superb performance of the main roles.**Don't listen reviews saying ""The book was better** Rarely can a movie pack the punch of a book with hundred's of pages into 2 hour movie. To those that haven't read the book, we couldn't care less about details being changed in the movie.It takes a while to get into the movie being that perspective's of multiple roles are shown to give full context. but it all gets neatly wrapped up for a climax at the end. Usually I like to pick apart flaws and poor acting but this was all believable and satisfying. It's a drama/mystery/thriller so you wont be finding any sunshine and butterflies here. Dark and sad is the theme."
" Cheap Thrills
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,5,"This was an actor's movie. It was character driven and all of the characters were normal people with complicated lives, which allowed for some good performance moments. But the higher quality acting could not save the horrendous script and directing. Sure, the director did a good job creating suspense and using some inventive shots. There was some good craft that went into that. In terms of being organic, though, there was a lot lacking.I have not read the book, but it sounds like it was quite the page turner and is riding the coat tails of Gone Girl. It has some similar themes to Gone Girl since it's about women getting back at men who mistreat them, but these themes are not included in a way that gives the scenes more substance. From seeing the movie, I could sense that the source material was pretty engaging and interesting, but the movie did not possess the page turning quality of a mystery book. Much of the movie was composed of showing how the connections between Rachel, Meagan, and Anna's lives all fit together. The problem was that most of the revelations weren't that surprising. They all pretty much told us something that had already been revealed and then a little more. It was easy to keep track of the information while I was watching it, but none of it hit me that hard or mad me more interested. Plus, it didn't really lead up to anything. The one reveal that actually worked for me was when Rachel finds out that Tom lied to her about what happened during her blackouts. Then, the movie took about twenty more minutes explaining all the different ways that Tom had been a jerk to these three women, so by the time the movie ended I was just bored.An equally major issue was that the dialogue did not feel realistic. The actors were able to make it a little better, but there's only so much that actors can do with a bad script. Some of the encounters took places in implausible settings, like when Scott is waiting in Rachel's apartment. There were also times when the characters would have big emotion dumps that just didn't feel like something an actual person would say. Worst of all was the climax. When Tom tells Rachel that ""In a way, you really killed her"", he just sounded like a total idiot, which is not good if you are trying to make an audience despise your villain. And most of my theater, myself included, actually laughed at the part when Anna twists the corkscrew deeper into Tom's neck. It may have been a great moment in the book, but it felt just so uncalled for that I couldn't help but laugh at it.I generally do not recommend this. It does not have that great of an element of suspense and is unlikely to hold your attention for long. It does look nice and has some decent editing and cinematography, but the technical skill does not make it a good movie any more than unique colors can make a good painting. Overall Rating: 6.2/10."
" Classic example of how to turn a great book into a terrible movie...
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,1,"I loved the book Girl on the train and the movie more of less follows the book, but that is the problem you have hours to enjoy the book and the screen play for a two hour movie does not work.. also Hello!!! The book is set in London.. not everything in the movie industry revolves around the US.. why does it have to be reset there. The movie reminds me of the us version of the girl with the dragon tattoo.. the Swedish original movie was far better. Its a pity because the actors are good, its just very very badly directed. So Hollywood please wake up and do something original that does not evolve a franchise with ten dozen sequels. Fedup with these movies."
" Good Mystery and Solid Acting but It's Undone by Scattershot Filmmamking and Useless Red Herrings
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,5,"This was supposed to be the next Gone Girl, or at least that's what I heard. I saw Gone Girl with a friend and was completely blown away by it. I heard about the comparison and even if it wasn't as good, I still wanted to see this. But I couldn't catch it in a theatre so I rented it. I can't hide how disappointed I was by this. I wouldn't call it awful or even bad but this wasn't anywhere close to a classic and I wouldn't recommend it, just check out the book instead.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Things are not going well for Rachel (Emily Blunt). She's unemployed (she was fired to due to her drinking), she's alone after being dumped by her husband Tom (Justin Theroux) and she can't let go of the past. She spends her days riding the train and dreaming up lives for the people she rides by everyday. The main object of her fantasies is a woman named Megan (Hayley Bennett) and her husband Scott (Luke Evans) who live a couple of doors down from where she used to. She tells us about how she believes they're the perfect couple and that they're the idealistic form of love. Her husband has got together with his mistress Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) and they have a kid and live in her former house. She's gotten in trouble for stalking them and she almost kidnapped their child. One day, she stumbles off the train and in her drunken haze runs into a blonde woman (it looks approximately like Anna or Megan). She blacks out and wakes up in her house with a headache and blood allover her clothes.Depending on who you talk to about this film, they'll be telling you that Emily Blunt deserves an Oscar nomination for this movie. I wouldn't go that far but this movie has top shelf actors/actresses and they all do at minimum decent work. Blunt makes for a convincing lead and she holds up her end. This movie should help Haley Bennett keep climbing the ladder, she does a great job even though her character gets on your nerves. Rebecca Ferguson is okay, she wasn't bad but I was more impressed with her in Mission Impossible. The rest of the cast is kind of at the mercy of their characters. Luke Evans did a pretty good job, Edgar Ramirez was alright but Justin Theroux wasn't very effective. I can't explain why without spoiling too much. I was confused why Laura Prepon, Lisa Kudrow and Allison Janney were in this movie, they don't get the screen time that you think they would.I found the central premise of The Girl on the Train interesting. They create interesting characters, you want to know what happened to Megan and if Rachel had something to do with it. The movie also does a good job obscuring things from the viewer, you'll definitely be guessing till the reveal. The problem I had was that this movie is so all over the place, it's hard to follow along at all. From what I hear, this is partially due to the book which also follows multiple viewpoints. I also get that our main character is a drunk. I'm cool with that but I feel like they still could have done a better job establishing how the events in the movie were unfolding. There's a difference between being secretive and shoddy storytelling. I would have liked this movie better if it had been clearer on what was going on.The other problem with this movie is that while it's jumping around the time line, they introduce so many subplots and characters that end up having very little effect on the actual story. It really screwed with the movie's pacing, there were pretty long stretches where very little is happening and there was more than one time that I thought the movie was losing focus.I've been hard on this movie but I didn't even dislike it really. I just didn't get the hype around it and I felt like the final product was a little over managed. It failed to translate what was so great about the book. If people end up liking this, I don't have any problem with that. This just ending up being pretty average and I won't be revisiting it any time soon."
" One train worth missing.
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,3,"Trains. There used to be something quite romantic about travelling on them. Sitting by the window, with a hot beverage in hand, watching the world sweep past you. You can still do that now of course, but you have to put up with a person next to you talking ear-piercingly loud on their phone; the person opposite falling asleep into a greasy kebab; the person next to them who just stares - at you; and getting a seat next to the loos that are leaking unpleasant smells. And that's if you can get a seat at all with everyone squished in overcrowded carriages like angry sardines.British author Paula Hawkins has obviously been stuck on the odd commuter train or two, as she wrote the best-selling The Girl on the Train - which also happened to be the most borrowed book from UK libraries in 2016, fact fans. With that kind of success it was only a matter of time, and a huge carriage full of cash, for Hollywood to turn it into a film. Like most people, Rachel (Emily Blunt) spends a lot of time commuting into the city. During the journey she stares out of the window, but instead of taking in the views, she's fixated with one house and the couple who live within its walls. It's not quite as creepy as it sounds; she used to live in the house next door with her husband Tom (Justin Theroux) until their divorce. He still lives there, with a new woman in his life, Anna (Rebecca Ferguson), and their new-born baby. Rachel is still struggling with their break-up, and continues her on-going relationship with alcohol to help ease the pain. Her drinking also leads to her turning up on her ex-husband's doorstep, and phoning constantly, which is not appreciated by the couple. Looking out of the train window on a daily basis, at the life she used to have and should still have, she notices Tom's neighbour Megan (Haley Bennett) and her husband Scott (Luke Evans). They appear to have the perfect relationship, fuelled by an abundance of love and passion. But when Rachel catches her in the arms of another man from her train window, she realises that everything isn't quite as it seemed. This notion is confirmed when Megan mysteriously disappears; unfortunately, due to her meddling in her ex-husband's affairs and regularly turning up on his doorstep in an inebriated state, Rachel finds herself in the middle of the investigation. To make matters worse, she has no memory of events, so isn't sure if she's involved or not. Could she really have had something to do with Megan's disappearance?Director Tate Taylor begins this journey by creating a modern day film noir feeling; his protagonist finds herself in a scenario that she is struggling to remember, and through the use of flashbacks, a picture is slowly revealed as to what actually happened. It's a solid device for a film of this ilk, however Taylor lacks the skills necessary to pull it off with any competency. With a whodunit, it's usually customary to have a big reveal at the end. Unfortunately, due to the limited number of characters in the story, audiences will know long before then; you don't need to be Sherlock (or even Mrs Hudson for that matter) to work it out, and once you have, it sucks out all the thrills the film blindly attempts to include in its second half. Even if you don't - you will, but for argument's sake go with it anyway - Taylor's approach feels dated, with the drama, and it has to be said a lot of the acting, turned up all the way to eleven, unnecessarily. So much so that in places it feels more like a parody of a drama than anything else. Its one saving grace though is Blunt and it's easy to understand why she took the gig; she manages to get right under the skin of the character, and bring all her faults into the light. Rachel is flawed and Blunt tunes in to each and every one of them with pure skill. It also has strong female performances throughout, which can only be a good thing. It's a shame then that the film puffs out its chest in a failed attempt to impress, delivering the cinematic equivalent of hot air. At some point, with its journey from the page to the screen, this project went seriously off the rails and ultimately isn't worth catching."

",2017-02-04 00:00:00,8,"a Great movie , it reminded me another great movie "" Gone Girl "" by David fincher, I didn't read the novel but the scenario was quiet good and the plot was nicely done, what made me like this book is Emily Blunt and her astonishing performance, I'm not saying that other members of the cast didn't perform, they REALLY did a great job, but Emily was the best. I also liked Halet Benett character, she's a good actress with a bright future, I've seen her this year on ""The Magnificent Seven"" too. I haven't seen any other works for the director Tate Taylor, but he has done a very good job with this, I'm looking forward to see his future works."
" 8/10 Clever thriller that keeps you guessing
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,8,"Superb thriller that keeps you guessing . Let's start with the title "" The girl on the train "" from the best selling book by Paula Hawkins . The title is brilliant and straight away intrigues you . As usual no spoilers in my reviews so I'll take you on part of the journey but we're not going all the way to the destination !The film opens exactly as you would expect with literally A girl on a train narrating her observations and feelings . Those who've read the book will note the change of location from the UK to the US but that was handled far better than I expected and it didn't lose anything from the story .You know something bad is going to happen but your not sure what , she invents her own little world but as you learn more you realise not is all as it seems . Many people have mentioned similarities to Gone Girl , I can't comment on that having not seen it yet but it did remind me of Rebecca and another film I won't mention as it will spoil the film . I managed to see this on a midweek silver screen showing for only £3 a long time after its release in a packed cinema . Not a spare seat in the house , I haven't seen that for a new film , though I do avoid cinemas on Friday & Saturday nights ! I think some of the sex scenes were a little too graphic for the audience as two people walked out !The story is brilliant , it does make you wonder if anyone is faithful in this world . It's definitely a film from a woman's perspective with back stories that help explain people's present day actions . It's adaption to film was always going to be tricky but it manages it admirably . If you like thrillers that keep you guessing to the end and you like to lead up garden paths and dead ends then this is a film for you . I enjoyed it."
" Highly Recommended
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,10,"This is the best mystery suspense thriller I've seen in a very very long time. It's no mystery why this is a People's Choice Award winner for Favorite Thriller Movie. Erica Cressida Wilson and Tate Taylor keep the viewer spellbound with the help of a perfect cast of actors. Top to bottom, from Blunt, Bennet and Ferguson to Prepon, Janney and even Darren Goldstein, (The Man in the Suit), this cast delivers. I disagree with professional critics that found the movie sluggish, melodramatic, convoluted or predictable. Taylor takes his time, guiding the viewer through a gamut of emotions to fully engage them in sympathetic response to all the characters, building suspense that lasts right through to the final frames. This is a superb piece of work. Highly recommended."
" girl on a train
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,1,"Been a while ....so here it is MOVIE OF THE WEEK aka WASTE of time aka Should've saved my money(Lily money) aka Lost 119 mins of our lives. aka Girl on a train. Beware of spoilers throughout this review . Starts of slow ,got slower,then time stood still,then backwards(some called it flashbacks) It has traces of Anna Karenina(the train)I wish she jumped. Traces of Birdman ( I still wish she jumped) And traces of Gone Girl.(minus Ben,minus the story line,) There are only a handful of movies that i wished I had walked out on and this was one of them .Should've snuck out and into another movie.All they did was shag.Not fun watching those scenes with your daughter.Not one of the characters had any endearing qualities There is something wrong with a movie if it doesn't have any characters that you want to like .I kept imagining that all the characters would hold hands and jump in front of the train.This was so tedious to watch .While Emily Blunt played the drunk with conviction it still wasn't pretty to watch.The movie jumped back and forth with no apparent reason other than to throw out the red herrings .It just came across as a bad peep show. Save your pennies and don't even bother if it comes up as $11. movie of the week."
" disturbingly good
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,7,"It is one of those where people will cry ""read the book, the book is so much better"". But isn't that always the case. A book allows the reader to create their own visuals, to personalize them in some way. Where as a film shows you the interpretation of another.That said it is very watchable, tense, and intriguing. The story line twists and turns, keeping it unpredictable and maintaining the viewers interest. Solid performances all round from a quality cast.The whole feel of the film is Gray and cold, it fits perfectly with the narration. A sad lonely lost woman, tormented by personal crisis. Looking out of the train window at the same scene during her daily commute.Well written, well acted, well shot. A little slow perhaps. But a well crafted film worth of a couple of hours of your time."
" The Girl Who Kicked The Tracks.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"Talking to a friend who was keen to see this adaptation after reading the book,we both decided to skip it due to the absolutely kicking it had received in reviews. Meeting a family friend over the weekend,I got told that the film (the book of which he has not read)was much better than expected,which led to me deciding to take a gamble and get on the train.The plot:Losing her job over alcoholism after her husband Tom has cheated with Anna Boyd, Rachel Watson starts having black-outs which leave Watson unable to remember what's happened. Keeping secret that she's been sacked from her flatmate,Rachel takes long train rides to pass the ""work time."" Taking a train which goes straight pass Tom and Anna's (who has just had a baby) house,Watson starts looking at Tom's neighbours Scott and Megan Hipwell,who appear happily married.One day,Rachel catches Megan kissing another man at the house.Horrified at her ""perfect image"" being broken,Watson jumps off the train to confront Megan. Binge drinking before the train ride,Watson faints before reaching Megan. Waking up in her apartment covered in blood and bruises,Rachel finds that she can't remember how she got home,as Rachel learns that Megan is missing.View on the film:Getting on-board during early stage of her pregnancy, (kept secret from cast/crew!) Emily Blunt gives a blistering anti-Femme Fatale Film Noir loner performance as Rachael. Dimly looking at the ""perfect"" couples across the tracks with eyes caked in black,Blunt superbly unseats the staggered nature of the Noir loner, pouring Watson out in bitter blends of over-confidence in protecting her ""perfect"" images,and a Noir pit that lands Watson with harsh reality. Joining in this prime cut ""Women's Picture"" Neo-Noir and also taking a liking to twitchy Justin Theroux's Tom, Rebecca Ferguson and Haley Bennett give excellent performance as Anna and Megan,with Bennett making Megan a bundle of sexy Neo-Noir temptation, whilst Ferguson fractures Anna's suburban, picket-line fence image created by Rachel,to release the bubbling Noir Fury.Changing tracks from the London setting of Paula Hawkins's book to New York,the screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson corkscrews the thrills for a simmering Neo-Noir atmosphere. Dovetailing fragmented flashbacks to Rachael going off the rails,Wilson presents with a sharp clarity the slurring state of Rachel,lit in sudden turns of aggression and a tense piecing together of her ""forgotten"" train ride. Opening the bottle to Tom's various relationships,Wilson cuts into an evil under the sun Noir mood, shining from a subtle, gradual changes in perspective,seeping a crisp Noir awareness under the nails of Anna and Rachael.Buying a Noir Thriller ticket for the first time in his credits,director Tate Taylor & cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen stylishly tap at the burnt Noir loner state of Rachael with grubby low-lighting opening the blackened,decayed wounds of Rachael. Backed by a shimmering score from Danny Elfman,Taylor layers the darkness with chilling stylisation of slow-motion rain hitting the frosty tracks,and screams from a horror-like nightmare linking Rachel's torn ticket memories."
" Manipulative, contrived and illogical elements fizzles out the mystery and suspense. Some good performances couldn't save it either
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,5,"Extremely popular thrillers are generally dumber than the actual good ones. Going by the popularity of its source material, I did have my inhibitions on how this might be. There is a minor but there is a chance of having the material improvised when transforming it on to the big screen, I had counted on it - How wrong was I? Apart from a predictably superlative performance by Emily Blunt, everything else just falls apart. Rachel (Emily Blunt) is a drunk divorced woman living in a friend's apartment and takes a train for work every day. Her ex-husband Tom (Justin Theroux) who cheated on her, currently lives with his present wife and a newly born in the same house which Rachel and Tom bought together. As the house is by the rail tracks which she passes by on her train commute every day, she gets obsessed by a couple who stays a couple of houses further from her house - names them Jess (Haley Bennett) and Jason (Luke Evans) in her head and wonder about their lives. One day she finds Jess intimate with someone who is not Jason, being in a heavily inebriated condition she impulsively wants to confront Jess and gets off the train. She wakes up the next morning bruised and blacked out of previous night's memory. Megan (Jess in her head) is missing and it is all over the news...When the book took the world by storm, it was admired for its breezy read full of twists and turns. There wasn't many who were fond of its too many gray characters or the quality of its story. Not having read the book, I will leave that observation from news articles as is. It definitely got its teaser trailer right, infusing that intrigue in you with all the mystery, suspense and modern story- telling. The movie hardly had anything more to offer from its teaser as it looked like it was just stretched out from it. Not every single person you meet in life could be as twisted as in Paula Hawkins world which makes it unrelatable. The plot twists are sometimes ridiculous and the important sequences that drive the story ends up being illogical. You will know the major climax revelation from a mile away and how it eventually pans out is quite a dampener. Something from a viewer's perspective is that you don't get a character to root for. With each character having their own misgivings, you'd rather think they are better off at where they are. Most of the actions look illogical and unbecoming of their characters especially the eventual victim and murderer. Emily Blunt has had an interesting filmography but I don't think her potential has been fully realized yet even though she got a chance to showcase her brilliance in bits, same goes in this movie too. Once you figured out the gist of the story and know where it is going, it becomes a plodding bore and a lot of time to get there. The background score didn't standout and the cinematography is just apt. When adapting from a book, the most important consideration would be to identify which section to highlight, which section to omit - as it isn't possible to carry forward in its entirety. Not having read the book, I can't comment about these choices but knowing how popular the book became - there is a chance that something went wrong in this process. Manipulative, contrived and illogical elements fizzles out the mystery and suspense. Some good performances couldn't save it either."
" Not a film for the impatient.....
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,8,"The Girl on the Train is not a film for the impatient. This is a slow burn thriller, that can seen a little ""disarticulated"" at first. The key character is a mess, who on first inspection, comes across as a obsessive compulsive, chaotic, alcoholic whose actions seem random, self inflicted and without merit. Yet, if you give this film a chance, you will come to see this is, in fact, a delicately crafted film.Pieces that don't fit, have, in fact, been cleverly placed to mislead and distract. Its a film that will have you looking at things from different perspectives and each time, reaching different conclusions. When the picture does finally start to come together, the assumptions I made dissolved and then coalesced into something new. Much as the clever writers and director intended. All in all, a good watch for those willing to invest the time and patience. Eight out of ten from me."
" Melancholy with a twist
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,9,"I know little about the book, but I loved this film. It was uncomfortable, awkward and dark. I was doubting all the characters right up until the end. I even paused the movie halfway through and wondered if I should continue watching because empathizing with Rachel's despair and confusion was just all too painful. I am so glad I continued watching. The final scenes masterfully piece together and the layers unearth so much more than expected. I even watched the final scenes twice just so I get some closure. Just like a good book I was sad the film had ended. Emily Blunt's performance is outstanding. She deserves an Oscar for this one."
" So much potential and yet...what did I just watch
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,3,"My three stars go solely to Emily Blunt who plays the character Rachel. She is the only character who was actually developed with any insight at all and I contribute that to Blunt's acting skills! As for the other characters and plot itself...yeesh. I read the book before the film, big mistake!! HUGE!! The book is written so well and the plot twist of Tom being Megan's lover was so blindsiding. The film made it obvious from the opening scene.Also I found that certain traits were either under or over-developed within the characters. Rachel's drinking was glamorised by the odd cocktail she sipped on at a bar, where as in the novel she is an actual addict. She wakes up hungover, she experiences withdrawal. You gain an understanding for the disease of addiction that this film skirted over.Tom was too dominating as a character. Good actor, crappy portrayal. Tom is depicted as kind and lovely in the novel and especially kind and lovely to Rachel even though Anna hates her. Yet in the movie... Speaking of Anna, where did her backbone go? Her character is far prouder and happier than this woman on the screen. While she is suspicious and neurotic where Rachel is concerned, she also adores Tom and yet that connection didn't seem there. Megan also disappointed me. In the novel she is very, very complicated. She loves Scott but is weary of his jealousy and his desire to have a child. Thus driving her to an affair. She is terrible but you connect with her nonetheless because there is something so endearing about her tough brokenness...and yet in the film I didn't really care that she died. I mean it was sad but I didn't connect with her, she was so cold, I wanted to connect, to understand her but I just couldn't. Don't even get me started on Cathy, not enough energy or time to waste on such a poor portrayal of a character.On to the plot. It was so very inconsistent! I do understand why- because the novel deals with the thoughts of Anna, Megan and Rachel, so I see how it would be hard to visualise such thoughts and I appreciate how they used an AA meeting to explain some of the memories Rachel had, but so many important details were ignored. If Harry Potter can successfully be made into a film , why is it that a thriller with fewer details cannot??Since when does Rachel draw? and what purpose did it play? Scott's freak out was so subdued because he and Rachel never slept together and he always seemed on edge already so whats a new little expression of his anger? ALSO WHY IS KAMAHL WHITE???? WHY? He was meant to be the most attractive and exotic character in the film. He was described as beautiful multiple times by both Megan and Rachel! Why was I given a white dude with a crappy Spanish accent??? That was reason enough to deduct a star.It feels like they skirted over so much. Honestly it's like seeing a kid try to colour in a picture: all the colours are there and you can see the picture itself, but everything is just not quite in the right place and the colours aren't always in the lines. Im disappointed. Do yourself a favour, read the book. I read it knowing who the killer was and I didn't feel like the story was ruined. DO yourself a favour and get to know the actual characters because they are so well developed. Pros of the film: Rachel,how Tom killed Megan,how cute baby Evie isCons of the film: Every other character (all of them), rushing through Megan's story, the final scene where Tom tries to kill Rachel."
" Really
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,2,This is some feminists garbage. Every woman is presented to be a victim as we find the common denominator to all their problems. Some squirrel trying to get a nut. Hollywood has a sickness that cannot be cured. They continue to pass off a great American pastime as a brainwashing session. Emily Blount did a great job acting the part. That girl has refined her skills. The writer did an adequate job of developing the main characters. The movie was a typical look into a different demographic and lifestyle that makes you want to keep your distance from such characters. It is Hollywood so things are exaggerated but their is an annoyance of entitlement and waste. The movie could have been fulfilling if the zealots could have toned down the passive aggressive feminist heroines.
" Wheres Emily Blunts Oscar nomination ?....
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,7,"First and foremost, what stands out in the film is Emily Blunts performance, she was able to confuse you and make you feel utter sympathy and for a character played with despair and melancholy.Second, I did not see the twist coming in the end, however the finale did feel uneven. As a character study on a very ""sad girl"" this definitely works, as a thriller/mystery it certainly does as well. What fails is the direction of the film, especially towards the end.There are some loose ends that don't quite connect or are left hanging. What saves the movie is the powerful emotional performance that deserves strong attention. I am making an effort not to spoil it with my review which is why it can't be too detailed, but once you see it you'll understand. The overpopulated characters are there to support a story that is not necessarily suppurating them, if that makes any sense. In the end it's a story about betrayal, motherhood, lust, identity and confusion. Final Grade B-"
" You may or may not want to ride this train.
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,5,"I can certainly see the appeal of Paula Hawkins' first successful novel 'The Girl on the Train', which was released in 2015, and was fast-tracked and optioned into a major motion picture by Universal Pictures to come out this weekend. It has some deeply dark and layered characters and tackles a range of emotions and vices from alcoholism, abuse, and even a murder. It's a good story with a who-done-it angle that feels fresh and original. The problem here is that the film felt a bit rushed and lazy, which gave way to the very slow burn the film has and never quite stays on point with its many flashbacks and timing, often times showing the same scene several times. It just got tedious and redundant twenty minutes in and never stopped being overly dramatic with longing stares, tears, and silence.The film didn't have an easy flow or pace to it, which could be derived from Erin Cressida Wilson's (Secretary) screenplay, which has a certain motive of to find out who the killer is, but the journey to get there is just dull and boring. Director Tate Taylor (The Help, Get On Up) doesn't add anything striking to the camera-work, besides making certain scenes hazy and blurry, as to make us feel drunk the whole time, like our protagonist Rachel (Emily Blunt). There really just wasn't anything special about the way the film looked, as everything had a very gray or muted color palette, minus a couple of scenes inside Rachel's roommate's (Laura Prepon) house.If you're unfamiliar with the story here or haven't read the book, the story centers on Rachel (Blunt), who is recently divorced and has trouble with drinking. She takes the train to New York every morning for work, and on the way, she notices her old house where her husband (Justin Theroux) and new wife (Rebecca Ferguson) and kid live. Next door to them is her old neighbors, which are a young couple (Luke Evans and Haley Bennett) who seem very much in love. One day on the train, Rachel sees something out of the ordinary, which sets in motion the whole plot of the film. From here, Rachel tries to figure out and solve a murder to someone she knows.Again, this sounds good on paper, but was not executed well on film. Allison Janney shows up in a few scenes as a detective and plays the part very well. Also, Lisa Kudrow shows up for a few seconds and is probably my favorite character in the whole movie, but isn't given any time to do anything with. Blunt does a decent enough job here, but like every character in the film, besides the actors who get less than a few minutes of screen time, play their roles in a very melancholy way, which drives the film into dull territory, which makes for a very slow and dragged out 112 minute experience.Perhaps the most interesting part of the film was the score, which was done by Danny Elfman, who scores most of Tim Burton's films as well as some great animated TV Shows (The Simpsons, Futurama). You wouldn't know it was a Danny Elfman score though, as he brought something new to the soundtrack here that keeps things tense and off-beat.WAIT FOR NETFLIX!"
" A good and tense thriller that is very much worth watching but, for me, it didn't really live up to the hype.
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,8,"""I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago, and gradually as the months went past she became important to me."" Rachel (Blunt) is a struggling alcoholic who rides the train from her home to the city everyday. She passes by the home of Megan (Bennett). For some unknown reason she becomes obsessed with the life of this woman. She thinks its perfect and wants her life. When she sees her with another man her world shatters, she blacks out and wakes up covered in blood. When she finds out Megan is missing she isn't sure what to think or do. This is a difficult movie to review. For no real reason I went in hoping it would be something like Gone Girl. The only reason I can think of is because it's a thriller based off a popular book. The big difference is I hadn't heard anything about Gone Girl before I watched the movie and this movie may have been a victim of over-hyping for me. The movie is very very good and enough twists to keep me interested and guessing, but I was just expecting something more and found the movie to be a little slow in some parts. Overall, a good and tense thriller that is very much worth watching but, for me, it didn't really live up to the hype. I give this a B."
" Depressing, boring
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,1,"A movie who's hero is a depressed alcoholic woman who continually stalks her ex and his wife, how lovely. The whole first twenty minutes of the film is nothing but closeups of her face while she rides back and forth on a train drinks and complains about her dreary boring life. Of course later on comes the usual male bashing of the no good husband etc. The three of us were pretty much all Emily Blount fans (until now). It was so bad in fact we almost walked out about half way through the movie. Why Emily Blount agreed to star in this awful, dragged out convoluted so called mystery is the question. Even if it's free on cable, stay away from this BORING depressing film, you'd have more fun reading the obituaries in the newspaper !"
" 'I need to remember.'
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,10,"Paula Hawkins' popular and controversial novel THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN has been successfully transferred to the screen intact by screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson and the beautifully photographed (Charlotte Bruus Christenen) and scored (by Danny Elfman) and paced story is the work of director Tate Taylor. Much like the novel the story bounces around form point of view of various characters and time forward and time back sequences that make the story that much more compelling. The cast is outstanding, with special kudos to Emily Blunt.The story is that of Rachel Watson's (Emily Blunt) life post-divorce. Every day, she takes the train in to work in New York, and every day the train passes by her old house. The house she lived in with her husband Tom (Justin Theroux), who still lives there, with his new wife Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) and child. As she attempts to not focus on her pain, she starts watching a couple who live a few houses down -- Megan (Haley Bennett) and Scott Hipwell (Luke Evans). She creates a wonderful dream life for them in her head, about how they are a perfect happy family. And then one day, as the train passes, she sees something shocking – Anna kissing another man - filling Rachel with rage. The next day, she wakes up with a horrible hangover, various wounds and bruises, and no memory of the night before. She has only a feeling: something bad happened. Then come the TV reports: Megan Hipwell is missing. Rachel becomes invested in the case and trying to find out what happened to Megan, where she is, and what exactly she herself was up to that same night Megan went missing. The psychiatrist Dr. Kamal Abdic (Édgar Ramírez) enters the intricate plot, seeing several of the characters in session, and the investigation of Megan's death is headed by Detective Riley (Allison Janney). The ending is a well-plotted dénouement and climax.Altogether a well-created film that pays attention to the psychological effects of alcoholism, spouse abuse, kidnapping, and contemporary marital relationships that are fragile at best. It is a thriller and exceedingly well acted psychodrama."
" Complete and utter pile of dross

What a completely irresponsible movie. Reprehensible and irredeemable. There is enough misery in life. Why would anyone want to punish themselves further with this inhuman cesspool of garbage, to sit in the dark watching a litany of crocodile tears for two-hours!? Man I'm so grateful for bluray rental. And didn't blow a whole evening at the cinema for this dross. Cant even imagine how depressed and anger I would have been had I done so. Not to mentioned how ashamed I'd be for my poor judgement. Emily I only saw this because of you. Now I'm going to have to second guess any movie you're in."
" Good Mystery, Suspense and Tension

When Emily has too much to drink she has blackouts and cannot remember what happened during the blackouts. When she was married to Tom he was the one who told her what had happened and she was made to apologize. On the train she sees a woman in her backyard on a terrace and imagines she has an ideal home life with her husband who Rachel also sees from time to time with the woman. One day Rachel sees the woman on the terrace kissing someone not her husband. Later she learns that the woman now called Megan (Haley Bennett) is missing and later found dead. Rachel goes to the police with her concerns. Detective Riley (Allison Janney) suspects Rachel because Rachel cannot explain what happened during her most recent blackout when she got off the train to tell Megan she's a whore but ended up being beaten and bloodied and Rachel can't explain what happened to her. Did she kill Megan? Did the man who got off the train with Rachel kill Megan? Inquiring minds want to know. What you read above is all you need to know at this point. There is a lot more, of course, but when I watched I got confused about many things and it didn't help that many of the women kind of looked alike and separating them in my mind was difficult. Yes, yes, all will be revealed later on, but in the meantime we go here and there with this clue and that one, but cannot resolve anything. Of course, we do suspect that Rachel is the killer, but kept hoping that wasn't true. StillProduction wise this is very good as are the performances of all. We do see women being physically abused and we had to turn out heads away. Not good. We see sex acts at times, without really seeing anything, but you know what is going on.It is not so much that we need to see clues to determine who killed Megan. Hey, this isn't a Charlie Chan or a Colombo story. But there are many, many twists and turns. Okay, okay, you want a clue? Something Rachel is told is not true, but Rachel is told many, many things. Now go with that. Ha!Notables: Rebecca Ferguson as Ana, the woman Tom married after divorcing Rachel; Luke Evans as Scott, Megan's husband; Edgar Ramirez as Dr Kamel, Megan's therapist; and Lisa Kudrow as Martha, the wife of Tom's boss. There is good suspense and tension throughout. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, several times Nudity: No. Language: Yes."
" Surprising
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,8,"Given the reviews on this site, I watched the film with low expectations, but as you can see, I was surprised with what the movie actually is.Some might say the movie is a slow burner, but for me, it holds an excellent rhythm during the almost 2-hour run, it achieves its mission to create suspense and mystery. The characters, besides Rachel, aren't at all likable and this is not a bad thing, until the end, you won't get to see everyone's true colors. Every actor is correct in their role but is Emily Blunt who delivers the best performance of the film, and for what I've seen of hers, this could be one of her most interesting roles so far. I have to admit that there is quite a plot-hole on the film, but it is a very ""technical"" one and it shouldn't ruin the film for anyone.I've seen some people accusing this film of men-hating, well, all I can say, as a man myself, is that only the most sensitive of rednecks would do such a remark.Overall, don't let the bad reviews push you away from watching the film, give it a chance. You won't regret it."
" One of the best thrillers.
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,7,"I have never actually read the book so this movie is my first time experience with these characters. For someone who hasn't read the book I can honestly say I fell into the film, and by the film i mean the characters. It was very beautifully taken and also it was taken in the right tempo, not too slow and not too fast just the right speed which really impressed me because that's where most movies mess up. It was worth the time and I suggest that this movie be in your ""definitely"" watch-list cause this is one of the movies you should not only see but experience, the characters portrayed have displayed emotions so strongly and so really that it will feel more like reality than fiction. A must watch."
" Wow, so many gushing reviews......this is not one
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,1,"For anyone wanting a suspense/thriller...kinda lacking! Very slow movie with multiple flashbacks that don't really connect. I spent most of the movie doing online stuff because it seriously couldn't keep my interest. I just hate spending money on a movie that I could see free on secondary channels! So many characters that didn't really connect that is was hard to follow. And, as with several movies of this kind, people pop up for no apparent reason. Just a real slow stupid movie. Reminds me of a Lifetime movie without Merideth Baxter. And that is not something I think of when I want to rent a Hollywood movie! Unless you like the Lifetime movies, probably should choose something else!"
" This train ride will rock you - don't miss it.
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,7,"""You are like one of those needy, abused dogs that just keeps getting up and coming back..."" Emily Blunt gives an Oscar worthy performance as a sad, lonely, deeply troubled alcoholic. She cannot draw the line between reality, obsession and fantasy. Unfortunately, she will need to in order to save what remains of her sanity. To call this movie a love triangle would be inaccurate as there are simply too many people involved. Just when you think you have it nailed - trust me, you don't. The atmosphere is moody, the acting superb, the script is perfection. It does take awhile to build, and build it does. While this movie is by no means a chick flick, it does delve deeply into the psyche of women - at least the ones in the film - their dark secrets , their bonds, their intuition. If I had only one criticism, it would be that the lead character's alcoholism is exploited. But I guess it has to be since it is an intrinsic part of the lead role."
" This train is empty
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,5,"The film adaptation of The Girl On The Train relocates the action from London to the New York suburbs but also makes the characters paper thin and mystery anodyne.Rachel is a lonely inebriated publicist who once had it all and blew it away. On her daily commute she looks out of the train on to the suburban houses and on to the idyllic lives of others such as young Megan and her hunky husband but a few doors away there is Anna, her young baby and her husband Tom. However Tom used to be married to Rachel.Megan was Tom and Anna's nanny and one day she disappears. Rachel thinks she saw something from the train and then intrudes on these lives. However Rachel ravaged with booze and behavioural problems is an unreliable narrator. Her memories are hazy and maybe she may even had been present when Megan disappeared.Emily Blunt does her best with the material as Rachel. With her English accent she already comes across as an outsider. The adaptation is reduced to making use of non linear flashbacks to stretch out the material because when you really look at the film and the characters the suspect is so easy to pinpoint. The eventual reveal has little surprise."
" Intersexual hate
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,3,"It was watchable because Emily Blunt is a very good actor, but what I want to say about this movie is that it is a movie which puts women in an inferior to men place in our society. That is to say that this movie wants to tell us - tell our Unconscious, which is far more worse - that women are dependent on men and that they can ruin their lives just for one stupid man. Instead of trying to bring people together the result of the movie is - especially when women watch it - ""women hate men because men are evil"". Because of that hate spread character of this bad movie I rated it so low...I would rate it even lower but Emily Blunt, and the other actors did not allow me to do that."
" Rachel
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,8,"Perform a technical genius to Rachel and I think Oscar in 2017 than its share very very good Rachel this movies of the wonderful selection of representatives, as well as a wonderful story and the actors' performance at the highest level and Director very good and performance of Rachel in a genius combination of internal sensations and facial expressions frankly all parties to work was to a high standard, especially Rachel Furthermore places good photography and angles of cameras and clear Please more movies brilliant film like this This film is the best film you saw in 2016 and I do congratulate each based on this fine work"
" Magnificent thriller!
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,7,"Emily Blunt gives one stellar performance as the protagonist ""Rachael""; a painful, clinically depressed, alcoholic, divorcée who torments herself daily by taking the train that passes directly in view of her previous home, where her ex-husband and new wife reside. As the viewer, you cannot help but be in love with Rachael, she is in extreme pain and her life is a train wreck, but she is ever so endearing. This story has several turns and twists, never failing to keep the viewer engaged and enthralled thru every second of this great little flick. Don't take your eyes off the screen or you could miss important details that outline this complicated story plot as it unfolds. Don't miss out on this fantastic little thriller!"
" Superb and amazing movie
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"Emily Blunt totally deserves an applaud for her acting. She has delivered an masterpiece. This thriller is atmospheric and suspenseful, like the best-selling Paula Hawkins novel it's based on. Emily carries the weight of Rachel's alcohol dependency, an awful cocktail mixed with grief and self-hatred. Its heroes and villains are painted with a one-dimensional brush, either evil and angry, icy, or simply a big hot mess.It almost feels like a lot of The Girl on the Train's potential was left on the cutting room floor, taken out for brevity or simplicity. But characters like these deserve complex treatment. And audiences need more than just the twist in the end if you want to leave them puzzling over a movie after the credits roll. What we get instead is an interesting enough, creepy enough experience. An amazing directed and superbly acted movie."
" Don't understand the poor reviews
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,9,"I thought this was a cracker. I am easily disappointed by hyped up films, but fortunately I hadn't read up or heard any detail so everything was brand new.There were some very good performances but Emily Blunt was amazing. The twists and turns were great and maybe I am naive but I didn't see them all coming. I do love a psychological thriller and the vulnerable and rather normal characters reacted well to the way the plot moved on. The first 20 minutes were a bit slow, but I would recommend you persevere with it as the film gets better and better the longer it goes on to a cracking crescendoEnjoy Everyone"
" Good. Different. Intriguing.
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,9,"This film was gripping from the very start. It had some great unexpected twists. The acting was solidly good throughout - not sure about Emily Blunt's accent, which was English 95% of the time: didn't really bother me though. Good film, fast- paced, intriguing... So why are there so many negative reviews? ""read the book"" - maybe I will - a film can be different to the book, doesn't make it a bad film (remember The Shining?) ""politically correct"" - omg, drunk woman, total loser, how is that PC? you really wonder about people sometimes My advice would be - if you're a misogynist or other type of total dick (can I say that?) then avoid this movie."
" Good movie - awful ending
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,3,A fairly good story and movie but with maybe the worst ending I have ever seen. Only possible in an American movie and so bad I almost could not believe it... There is an OK story and the acting is OK too. Good idea Good actors. I thought the killers motive was very thin and very unlikely. The actor playing Rachel was the best. She was authentic and I could follow where she was coming from. Good detail that she did not do all the stuff she was accused of. This was a fine twitch. Other than the ending the movie is OK. I really think the ending tells a story of a country that thinks there are good and bad people and that the bad people deserve to die. That is an awful way of thinking. I must take a major distance to this kind of thinking. This made the movie interesting on another level. it told me something about America that I only assumed be true.
" Confusing
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,3,"I was really looking forward to this film. I'd considered buying the book but decided to wait for the film. Knowing that the book upon release was touted as ""this year's Gone Girl"" I hoped the film would be as good as Gone Girl. It's not. It has a terrible ending like Gone Girl but none of the suspense or mystery of the other film. It starts off slowly with a voice-over from Emily Blunt's character to set the scene. This feels like you're listening to someone read the book to you. It goes on too long, but when it's over Blunt's character talks to a few people on the train but even the dialogue just sounds like she's narrating her life story. After about half an hour the plot kicks in. From here it's a mix of entertaining pieces mixed in with scenes where Blunt's character acts as a detective (albeit one who's permanently wasted and can't remember a bleeding thing). There are a few flashbacks too, some of which are quite interesting. But I was still confused as to what was really going on, which can be a good thing if you care about the characters, but they're all so miserable and depressed. And they're all having affairs with each other. The final act kicks in and the twists start coming thick and fast. Some are good, some are lazy and obvious, but the film definitely picks up pace at this point. But then comes the final reveal and it's a real eye roller. Spoilers coming up - Emily Blunt's ex husband turns out to be a serial cheat and generally all round meanie. His former boss, played by Lisa Kudrow warns that she had to fire him because he was having affairs. What? If that's a sackable offence, it's no wonder unemployment is so high. So then you get the Gone Girl ending, only ramped up to eleven. Because Blunt's ex husband is so awful (He cheats, he lies, he's killed someone who he got pregnant etc), he gets stabbed to death by Blunt and his current wife. And everyone lives happily ever after. At the end of the day this is yet another film that rams home the message that all men have affairs and don't appreciate their wives, and in this case, that's an offence punishable by death without any repercussions."
" Emily Blunt worth an Oscar!
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,9,"I read some of the reviews here, and came with very low expectations to this movie, and WOW, what a pleasant surprise! Blunt gives here the show of her life, way above the level of acting in ""edge of tomorrow"". The story itself takes time to build but it all adds to the atmosphere, and finally you get a fair amounts of twists and turns. Bennett and Ferguson also acting very well, which all adds (to my opinion) to a great film. And to all the men that say it's a ""men hating"" film, I say that you really have a low self-confidence to come up with such a statement... I would risk to say it's one of my 2016 best films, and I will be surprised if Blunt will not be an Oscar nominee for this film."
" A crappy version of Gone Girl
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,4,"This film had a lot of potential. The budget was there, the cast is great, we have top actresses that are professionals, have big enough names to bring viewers but aren't superstars that the film becomes all about them. The change of location isn't such a big deal.The problem is that it glosses over the backstories of the characters. We just find ourselves in the middle of this situation, we get some flashbacks, but it's a bit too late when it does. We get this image of Megan throughout the film, but when her backstory is shown in a flashback, it's too late for us to care. It's not big enough of a revelation for us to change our opinion of her. The film presents it as a twist, but it just feels like an anecdote. When there's a murder investigation, the story of your abortion appears insignificant in comparison.The other part I didn't like was that all the characters in the story were variations of the same person. If that was the point (highly doubt it) then this wasn't done well enough. If that wasn't the point, why is everyone some moody, depressive, suburban emo? It seems as if everyone suffers from depression - post-partum, alcoholic/unemployment, suburban-existential(?). What kind of depressive world is this?Why does a doctor named Kamal Abdic played by a Venezuelan actor? I'm not saying ""he doesn't look Yugoslav, blah blah"" - but couldn't they find a single Yugoslav actor? Maybe they couldn't and Ramirez is a higher profile actor, that's cool, but why didn't they change the name of the doctor to a Spanish name? They didn't even need to do that and it would just be a small oddity, but why is the doctor speaking Spanish? He actually spoke in fluent Spanish. That makes no sense at all for someone born in Yugoslavia. Ramirez didn't need to show us his Serbo-Croatian skills, he didn't need to even put on a Balkan accent, but why is a man from Bosnia speaking Spanish so fluently? How?Finally, there's some considerable spin going on in this film. Everyone is having an affair, but the movie makes it to be that it's all the fault of one man. It takes two to tango, but in here, everyone tangos but it's the fault of one individual. Basically, if two married people have an affair, it's the fault of the man. It just is. The strangest thing is that this Tom is shown as a terrible man - domestic violence, not-too-consensual-sex, fired from his job, serial cheater, liar, says horrible things, threatens his own child... so why are all these women attracted to him? There is not one good thing about him. He has no redeemable qualities, yet he is this irresistible man that makes women forget their own names, jobs or the fact that he's married.By cutting time from Tom's story and by giving him every bad quality possible, we are left with a caricature and the mystery of how all these women are attracted to him that they want to live with him, love him and bear his children.This film gets a failing grade."
" Confusing but brilliant
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"I have never read the book for this film but have heard of its success and popularity. A lot of people say that the book was way better than the film but with haven't having read the book, I found this film to be brilliant. Its very confusing and blurry at first but keep at it, as the film progresses things become much clearer and very clever. What an amazing and shocking end too.I loved the way this film showed mental instability and made me as the viewer as confused as Racheal (The protagonist). Although the way the film is presented at the begging as confusing its one of those clever films that has an amazing ending that just makes you get it all."
" Not entirely bad but nothing special
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,4,"First review on here, sorry if it sucks...This movie was decent but it wasn't anything I feel the need to see again. It's certainly one of those movies that adds too many unnecessary sex scenes and I got annoyed with that very quickly. Emily Blunt's acting was decent and she was the best part of the movie for me. (Sidenote: I thought Megan was played by Jennifer Lawrence for most of the movie. They look a lot alike!) About halfway through it I figured out who the killer was because there was very few characters, it just made the most sense it was Rachel's ex-husband. I think the way they show the timeline does make this more confusing and interesting so it isn't super obvious. I also think the final scene was well done."
" The Vidiot Reviews...
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,5,"The Girl on the TrainThe best thing about living with an alcoholic is that they always have cocktail umbrellas handy.Unfortunately, the dipsomaniac in this thriller doesn't dabble in drink flourishes.Ever since her husband (Justin Theroux) left her for his mistress (Rebecca Ferguson), Rachel (Emily Blunt) has split her days between binge drinking and stalking his new family. When the couple's nanny (Haley Bennett) goes missing, Rachel becomes the prime suspect. But her inebriation keeps her from recollecting the events. Through the victim's husband (Luke Evans), she learns the nanny was seeing a therapist (Édgar Ramírez), whom suspects killed her.While the story starts off promising with good pacing and impressive performances, it soon derails once the murder element is added. More sudsy than suspenseful with an obvious ending, this adaptation of the bestseller is ultimately unsuccessful. Moreover, once your mistress becomes your wife you have to constantly lie to both of them. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
" It's stand-out performances from Blunt and Hayley Bennett that ultimately make this worth sticking with.
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,6,"Paula Hawkins' acclaimed novel is brought to the big screen by The Help director Tate Taylor and stars Emily Blunt as Rachel, a divorced alcoholic obsessed with a couple she sees on her daily commute.With an intrinsic plot and interchange of characters and relationships, The Girl On The Train promises to be a taut, intricate, intense thriller. Perhaps the book is, but unfortunately the film does not live up to this promise.There are various flaws, particularly regarding the pitch, pace and tone of the film; Taylor's constant cuts, edits and switching of story-arcs occur so frequently that they become distracting and result in a failure to produce any tempo or even tension, ultimately leading to a somewhat flat finale.However, it does offer enough to maintain interest and the established source material thankfully ensured story-telling remained coherent, but it's stand-out performances from Blunt and Hayley Bennett that ultimately make this worth sticking with.They are both terrific in their respective roles as tormented, grieving young women. Bennett's emotional performance equals Blunt's physical delivery and they are both extraordinarily captivating, drawing in and maintaining the audience's focus to the very end. They stand head and shoulders above their male counterparts and ultimately save this film from becoming an overly mundane experience.For the full review, and further movie reviews, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/JMCReelReviews/"
" Gone Girl on a Train Wreck
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"Much like 2016's Hell or High Water was No Country for Old Men-lite, 2016's The Girl on the Train was Gone Girl-lite. So, if you liked the latter movies, you'll like the 2016 releases.I try my absolute best to avoid spoilers and even going as far as skipping trailers. But, The Girl on the Train did somewhat hit my radar and, luckily and surprisingly, it surpassed and altered my expectations. I had no idea it was about a drunk. (Says Steve as he takes another gulp of Bud Light.)So, if you wanna know less about this experience like I gleefully did, minor spoilers ahead. I do not ruin plot points or surprises, but I do offer up brief synopsizes in my reviewsthings I don't even wanna know myself until I see the movie. I highly recommend you seeing this anyways, so do. And then come back here. After you bookmarked this, of course.The movie opens with some beautiful shots of the travels of a ""girl,"" haha – definitely a woman, on a train who fantasizes about the homes she passes on the way to work. She has a self-proclaimed overactive imagination and I could relate. I, too, look at other people, locations, scenarios and daydream up their entire story.But, then a sparkle of a deeper story emerges of some of the places and people this ""girl/woman"" sees. More and more onion layers are sliced away until you realize how much this random passenger is actually involved in these stranger's lives. Oh, and there's a murder involved and we need to determine on who's responsible. I've actually heard many negative things about this, and quite frankly, I respectively disagree. I had a great time with the shifting timelines to tell a compelling story of a who/why-dunnit. As mentioned about, it reminded me a lot of Gone Girl, and it does in atmosphere and storytelling and as good as I think this movie is, it's not close to that caliber. Nevertheless, it's completely worth it and a fun, pulp fiction tale that won't change the world, or cinema as we know it, but will entertain us as if we, too, had a long train ride and needed to occupy our time.***Final thoughts: It's a tad long and not to be taken completely seriously, but stick with it. At least, it has the always hunky Edgar Ramírez in it. There's that, at least."
" Intense
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"I haven't read the book, but decided to watch the film anyway! Even though the film is a little slow, I found it very intense, with hints of psychology, it is twisted, mysterious, dark and also brutal, I absolutely loved the film and wasn't at all what I expected! Emily Blunt (Rachel) plays the character so well as she is the main focus of the film, I would definitely give her 10/10 for her performance, absolutely outstanding. If you like films that are dark, brutal and also psychological then this is a film for you! After watching the film I have ordered the book to see the difference on what other reviews are about! It is a film that you should watch and make your own mind up about! Each to their own, I would definitely recommend!"
" Very boring mystery crime drama.
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,3,"This is one of those mystery movies that tries to be more than what it really is. In another words the whole premise and direction felt like it was dragged out way too much. Without adding anything all that thrilling or interesting to sit through. In another words, it's a extremely slow movie to get into and the payoff isn't really worth it either. The plot focuses in on multiple women, especially on a girl named Rachel played by Emily Blunt. Who constantly has black outs and alcoholic problem. Who also deals with paranoia and psychological problems. I did like how people's perspective of others might not be entirely what it seems. Like behind a smile could be sadness and despair and etc. And I thought the scenes where Rachel has this jealousy towards a couple who she thinks has the perfect love life to play an interesting twist in the story. However the constant delving into the mindset and inner demons of each of the characters to be lackluster and easily forgettable. I personally think more of a focus on solving the mystery would have added more to thrills and enticing moments. But for like an hour into this movie, I couldn't grasp what this movie was about because it just seemed like it was all over the place. Now for some movies this direction can work but for this one it just came off very distracting from the core of the story. Because the drama parts and expositions is a complete snooze fest. I did like the psychedelic cinematography with some dream like sequences. But it didn't connect me to any of the character or made me want to keep on guessing on what is really going on. Overall, I regret watching this movie and I will probably forget about it in like 2 days.3/10"
" low quality crime investigation
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,4,"The first half of the movie is imagination by Rachael, creating a lot confusing to audiences, and it is weird and meaningless.there is a lots flaws in this movie, tom should bet this crime on the mental problem ex-wife and hypnosis her to forget what she saw. At the end ex-wife figured out her memories were fake and injected by tom hypnosis, he should immediately kill her but NOT hypnosis her again and allow her to run and kill him with stupid tool. for god sake.All the movie is dumb, a simple investigation turning to a crazy mind imagination. The ending is too simple and nothing shocked.Sometimes the market loves to see bad end stories, such as ""autopsy of Jane Doe"", all cast has died for no reason, and it breaks all the traditional rule of justice always win or Main casts shall survive. Tom in this movie shall be alive and would be better surprise that seeing Rachael dies and they continue a happy marriage.Overall, GONE GIRL is a better, it shouldn't rated 6.6 it shall be given around 4-5."
" Do not bother
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,2,"OK, first of all Emily Blunt is a great actress. It's worth wasting 1,5 hours of your life watching this movie just for her. The way she plays this drunk (at times) woman is just excellent. Other than that, it's really wasting 1,5 (or so) hours of your life. It's boring, unconvincing, doesn't get you involved. I don't know, there's just something wrong with the story and the characters. Where's the thrill? Where is the twist? Where's the biting-your-nails element? The feeling I had watching it was: I just don't care. There is no suspense, no drama, no mystery, nothing a movie of this kind should have. And come on - this husband/psycho guy... Really? I'm so disappointed. But hey, maybe my expectations were too high?"
" slow building crime drama
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,7,"There are a few missed opportunities in The Girl on the Train directed by Tate Taylor bringing to screen Paula Hawkins's successful novel. The story starts like a voyeuristic drama involving three women (two of them resembling each other), two houses (resembling each other as well in a suburban area), two men, and one train which is the moving observation point from which flashes of the reality are perceived. Details are not clear from the beginning, the story builds up and so does our understanding of the characters and the drama that is taking place, which soon turns into a disappearance case. All this gradual assimilation of the events by the viewer is not a bad thing, it's not an easy viewing, but it's challenging intellectually and the later developments and its solution are eventually rewarding. There is however something 'heavy' in the director's style that adds extra and unnecessary obstacles between the heroes and the viewers.I did not read (yet) the book that inspired the film, but my understanding is that much if its interest derives from the fact that the story is told alternatively by the three women, each with her subjective point of view, each holding piece of the reality the way she sees it (or deforms it). The film tries to start this way using off-voice screen (which seldom works for me) but soon moves the weight center of the story to Rachel's character played by Emily Blunt. We gradually come to know her as a broken person, victim of a disastrous marriage, alcoholic, voyeuristic, unable to forget and continuing to be obsessed by the life and the husband she lost. As the story develops she becomes involved as a witness, as a detective, as a prime suspect in the disappearance turning into a murder case. The cinematographic version of The Girl on the Train is very much a story about Rachel, about her obsessions and her fight to recover her own self.The story offers the opportunity for three major and consistent feminine roles, an opportunity which only Emily Blunt uses well. This is not necessarily because Haley Bennett or Rebecca Ferguson are bad actors. but because the way they are directed is much more conventional and lacks complexity. The other surprise in acting is Luke Evans, who acts the other prime suspect, and the man who eventually will disperse the part of the fog on what really happened and who really Rachel is. The rest is left by the script (maybe also by the book) to fate.Director Tate Taylor does not lack some good directing ides. See for example the alternate usage of fixed or hand-held camera, sometimes in the the same scene or filming the two actors of a dialog, He fails in constructing a better paced story telling. Some of this may be intentional in order to leave to viewers gradually discovering what the story is about. They did not lose me, but they risk losing many other viewers in search of an entertaining thriller. Trading pace and action for psychology is a risky proposal nowadays. I do not believe that the director won the bet."
" Excellent film! Negative reviewers need to watch it again.
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"I own the Kindle and Audible book but never read it and only listened to a few minutes of it until last night after watching the film on Amazon. Then listened to a few hours of the book overnight. From a cinematic viewpoint, the movie felt like Alfred Hitchcock had come back to life. Wow.The overall tone of the book and movie is morose and requires total attention to detail to not get lost in the droning, depressive quality of the people and become confused. Comparisons with ""Gone Girl,"" had turned me off to reading or seeing this earlier, because I didn't care for the movie ""Gone Girl"" and the book didn't hold my attention.I found this film to be technically excellent and the performances are Oscar worthy. Now reading reviews and seeing lousy critical reviews, it is kind of a shock. Seriously, Emily Blunt in particular, but the entire cast was perfect.The complexity of the story is put together so well, the inherent confusion of so many flashbacks and narratives from the book, is remarkable screen writing and the direction never fails.This film is the best movie I've seen in 2016, next to ""The Witch,"" another critically slammed masterpiece of filmmaking."
" Great Movie
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"At first you don't know what to expect from the movie and from the title. I knew there was a book but I haven't got the time to read it yet. It's about a woman who takes the train everyday to go to work. In the train she can see the landscape and starts to think about the life of the people she sees. She sees her past her in a girl and then this girl turns up missing. I think it's a great movie, I love it. It's similar to the movie Lost, which I love it too. It has mystery, drama and a very good performance from all the actors. Emily Blunt looks really sad and you can sympathize with her situation, divorced and without a family, really sad."
" Brilliant
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,9,"I have been on IMDb for a number of years and always rate the movies i watch. I have not written many reviews,however i think i needed to write this one. This film is brilliant. I haven't read the book but the story was excellent and having read reviews i am disappointed with the negative reviews of this masterclass in story and film making. Do not be put off folks, this was a real thriller mystery and deserves a big 9.the acting was superb,and having been in a drunken state myself for a time they couldn't have put it more realistic. Enjoy its really good, please check my review scores before taking my opinion,i don't like crap as you will see."
" Below expectations but Blunt's Amazing portrayal ,stellar direction binds together pyschodramatic mystery as the events unfold to reach its shocking conclusion
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"Since I have not read the novel so this will be a review solely based on the movie only. As expected from the trailer this was supposed to be a ride of thriller but it ends as a slow paced which gains momentum only during last 30 mins. The only thing that saves this movie is Blunt's Amazing Performance accompanied by a stellar direction but not fully polished. As a thriller Mystery it works absolutely perfect but the story doesn't quite match its script which actually disturbs the whole momentum. As expected from the hype for both novel and the movie , its delivers its shocking twist towards the end followed by yet another shocking twist which was unexpected and surprising but was not portrayed very well. The only good thing I found in the movie that is the only thing you should watch it for is Blunt's performance which is a career high for her and also should Grant an Oscar nom for Best Performance by a Female.As speaking for the story I can't say much this being a spoiler free review but all I can say is story is actually great , its intriguing , characters are well portrayed , sex scenes are dull.So if you don't care about a lousy script then you can watch this mystery or if you care then well read the book. Again even though I rated it 7/10 its 10/10 for Emily Blunt's performance."
" Shocking execution
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,4,"After hearing of the novels brilliance and world wide fame, my decision was improper and I should of read the book before watching this. The main reason I feel disappointed with this feature is the fact that the execution of such a simple story line was completely destroyed and maimed by the entire cast and production team. The use of poor actors who frankly couldn't act their way out of a pub pretending to be half cut. Emily Blunts performance was not only unconvincing, but it was almost entertaining, the kind of entertainment that you expect from a clown or village drunk. What I'm saying is, how in gods name did she manage to land this part in such a wide selling novel....?? Who knows? Only the director Tate Taylor can answer this question. Such a pathetic and weak performance it's almost unbearable, I found my self thinking about other things whilst watching this.If you're looking to throw away 2 hrs of your life time to watch this, don't! Its really is that bad....... Stay away!I feel let down by this feature and won't be reading the book as committing to the book will only infuriate me more so."
" The Girl on the Train (2016)
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"Ninety percent of the time, I have not read the book that the film is based on. This happens to be one of those instances. The film boasts a good cast (Haley Bennett is a rising star for sure) a mysteriously intriguing premise, and solid trailers. How could anything go wrong? Sad to say I think a lot of things did go wrong here. This was quite a messy film in all honesty and a big disappointment. The film may resonate well with fans of the book, so my review is from the eyes of a film watcher solely.The film is about an extremely disheveled woman (who also happens to be a blithering drunk) who watches a seemingly perfect couple in a house outside where her daily train stops. She is envious of Megan Hipwell, the woman who lives in that house. Oddly enough that woman lives in the house next to her former boyfriend (who has started a new family with another woman). In her drunken states she makes unwanted calls and visits to her ex's house. One day, Megan Hipwell disappears and the cause of her disappearance leads back to one of the people who are introduced in the film. But who is it? Sound confusing? It kind of is when you have to keep thinking of what is happening where. Like the protagonist, this film is a mess.Flashbacks are okay if done in a clean and coherent manner. This film keeps doing messy flashbacks to different stages, that it becomes a chore to keep up with the different story lines of the characters. Speaking of the characters, they are all unlikable. The protagonist is not someone I can identify with and she becomes a tiring figure as the film goes by. After a while, I got sick of seeing her character in the same zoomed in shot with a confused crying face. You can't connect with Megan Hipwell because she's having relationships with multiple people. Not judging her character but she's so fleeting and doesn't connect or commit to anyone, so not sure why we would to her. Other characters just come into play as a plot device (Lisa Kudrow's character) and others just fade away completely (Laura Prepon).I'm not sure how the book was written but I sure hope the twists and reveals were written better than they are adapted onto the screen. All of the thrills feel cheap and the film becomes a task to keep up with for a while, that you find it hard to care after a while. I think the main character is also a bit of an idiot at a certain point of this film but its hard to go into that without spoiling the film. I have to say, I was greatly disappointed by this film because I was expecting a decent thriller. You just wish Emily Blunt had her eyes closed on the train the whole time, thus avoiding everything that happens in the film.5.5/10"
" Why weren't more women in the audience offended by this movie?
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,4,"After hearing The Girl on Train was based on a bestselling novel, I was really looking forward to seeing it; especially after hearing it was being compared to movies like Nocturnal Animals and Gone Girl. However, after seeing it tonight, I am left with mixed emotions. Some reviews online call it depressing, manhating, and an all-out, over-the-top soap opera. I, on the other hand, definitely thought the movie had something but was poorly executed. I also thought the first 2/3 of the film was a scrabbled mess, where the final third of the film was the whole movie. My fiancé tells me that the book is much better, so I'll probably read it at some point to put the movie into some perspective. I didn't think the movie was manhating at all. Although, I can't deny that Tom (Justin Theroux) was a complete psycho and ultimately deserved to be killed by the women he mistreated. If anything, I thought the film couldn't have made the women in the film look more stupid, or utterly brainless. I thought only Rachel (Emily Blunt), to spite being a mentally unstable alcoholic, was the only decent (female) character in the film. I couldn't even imagine what my life would look like after surviving a monster like Tom. I also thought she was incredibly brave to face that psycho at the end of the film, and risk everything to save Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) and her child. I don't know how many other people would risk their lives to save the person who destroyed their marriage. Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) for example, said at one point: ""She enjoyed being the other woman."" I am sure it must have been the proudest moment of her life to completely destroy Rachel's marriage and leave her life in ruins; and then to see her at the end of the film looking completely shattered (or even surprised) to hear that her husband (Tom) was sleeping with half the city during their affaire and was currently sleeping with the nanny (Megan) under their very roof and in their bed. It's what we call karma, my dear; if you're stupid enough to marry a man who has a long history of cheating on his ex-wife, don't cry about it when he finally cheats on you too. Megan (Haley Bennett), who is a married woman, having unprotected sex with 3 different men in her life, 1 including Tom, while simultaneously trying to get pregnant with her husband. Why on earth would she ever get involved with a cheating scumbag like Tom is simply beyond me; a man, who she knows, has a long history of cheating on his wives and his mistresses. He sounds like a keeper, a real Prince Charming I would have thought most women are smarter than this? She had a decent man at home (who loved her) and here she is sleeping with both her Boss (Tom) and her psychologist, Dr. Kamal (Edgar Ramírez), and who knows how many others. I think what Rachel called her in the tunnel was more than justified... and, then to watch Tom beat the sh*t out of Rachel and then to willing walk into the woods with him alone – it doesn't say much for her intelligence does it - why didn't she just call the Grim Ripper ahead of time and book in an appointment? And, finally there's Detective Riley (Allison Janney). She's so focused on pinning Megan's death on Rachel that she was unable to connect A with B. After learning that Megan was pregnant (and ruling out both her husband and Dr. Kamal as the father), I am surprised a DETECTIVE wouldn't use their initiative to look into Tom. Detective Riley knew absolutely everything about Rachel but didn't think to look into her crazy ex- husband as well. Instead, it was a mentally unhinged alcoholic that cracked the case. It doesn't say much for Detective Riley does it? I think each of these 3 characters, in some point in the film, could have asked themselves: If I only had a brain? I am surprised more girls weren't upset by this film? I know a lot of very strong, smart, intelligent women in my life – people I actually look up too, and could easily run rings round me – and here they are being depicted as just idiots.."
" Americanised version of a chilling, suspenseful tale
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"Taking a thoroughly English story and turning it into an American one always hurts the original tone. But the story is so rich and powerful that you can't really do too much damage.I'd say the best part about the film is Emily Blunt. Even though she uses her own English accent in the movie, she sounds like someone who has lived in the US for quite some time, and it probably would have made more sense for her to have an American accent. If they changed the setting and all the other characters to American, why not do the same with the protagonist? That being said, she was absolutely perfect for the role. She was consistently sad and droopy and was perfectly convincing as the alcoholic, depressed Rachel. The rest of the story played out as it did in the book. But the truth is, I couldn't put the book down, which doesn't happen very often. So apart from Blunt's acting, and the mysteries surrounding her character's blackout drinking during the night of a girl's murder, the film doesn't do too much for me."
" If we take out misandry, there is almost nothing left
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,2,"I can't help but think of the Seinfeld episode in which Jerry complains that a dentist changed his religion to Jewish just so he could tell jokes about Jews. The priest asks him ""And this offends you as a Jewish person?"" to which Jerry answers ""No, it offends me as a comedian!"" Well, while I don't take to misandry or misogyny well, I am offended even more by the film's storytelling regardless of its shallow theme. This film about an alcoholic who maybe sees something, is purposefully misleading you, the viewer, and skipping important details so that you are left wondering until the very end. It's not like in reality those things are hard to find out; no, they are skipped so that you don't know where in time or place you are, or even who you are watching.Unfortunately, this trick is used and abused whenever the filmmaker has nothing to say and when there is no interesting plot to develop. You can get people interested in a film by telling a good story, or you can admit that you have no plot by simply skipping through time, back and forth, skipping over important details, give us glimpses which are entirely false, and so on. Some people fall for it, but some of us do not - we know a good story when we see it, and when we don't, we tend to stay away. I only watched this train-wreck in slow motion to see if I were right, and I was. However, I must admit, the director surpassed my expectations in being a poor storyteller. I could tell within first five minutes that the director was clueless due to lack of motivation for all the characters' somber tone. Director is an actor himself, but has a poor understanding of that word - motivation. People don't just get sad or angry, they need a reason. If you don't want to show the reason, at least give a clue. No such a thing here. We are expected to believe that these people are screwed up just because the director says so. At least good thing is - there is no way I would ever watch any of his movies ever again.All in all, this is a story that could have been OK, were it not for forced ""psycho"" drama, contrived story telling, and outright misleading audiences to achieve some level of interest. If you like such cheap tricks, then this film is for you. If you prefer interesting stories to contrived ones, then stay well away.The only redemption is Emily Blunt's performance. She never fails, and she is brilliant here, again. She made this film watchable, hence two stars from me, rather than zero. Everything else though was not worth my effort; and this depressing piece of toxic junk does need much effort to follow and watch, if nothing, at least due to incomprehensible dialogues (another cheap trick; you think there is something interesting you missed, if you don't hear it!).From ridiculous premise and unbelievable characters, and all men doing something despicable, to the nutty main character and everyone else lacking a moral compass, and above all - poor motivations for any of the above, this film is a best to be avoided."
" very good thriller
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"i really liked this movie.i thought it was strong,intense and i totally bought the whole plot.OK maybe if you'd think for a little bit you could understand who the bad guy was,there were not many too many characters to begin with.but the surprise and turning point of the facts altered to me where a surprise.i told you i bought the plot.i am not cynical but i have a long experience in watching movies.for instance i thought jack reacher 2 was a very mediocre predictable movie.also,i don't like movies that tend to show only one side of people.for instance,all women are victims and all men are bad.as this movie is attacked by many to be.but i don't agree.first of all there was a guy who saved her.and the woman lieutenant was a moron.but i think i was grabbed from the very first minute from ms. Blunt's extraordinary performance.maybe that movie was intended to be your typical feminist thriller.but the level of acting from everyone was above average.i am surprise that some people were put off from the fact that blunt was nominated for a screen actors award.i see she is not nominated for a golden globe.that's a shame.it is a long time i have seen such a fragile performance.BRAVO TO HER !!!! also the direction was very good ,with close ups to make you feel the tension ,the fear,and be uncomfortable for the character's problems.i don't know guys ,i think this movie is a winner.it did not get very good review.i just disagree.i strongly recommend it.if only for ms. Blunt's but also ms. Bennett's special performance."
