" It's a disaster for a disaster movie.
",2021-03-18 00:00:00,1,"Worst writing I've seen so far. Scientifically, Mathematically, mentally and logically wrong in every part of the movie."
" So terrible yet amazing at the same time.
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,7,So terrible yet amazing at the same time. I've never written a review before but this has inspired me. And the song that plays in the end credits. It maintains its cheese factor strong and solid to the end. Awful but I had a great time watching it.
" Genre Fans Will Mostly Enjoy
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,7,"I'm a sucker for a disaster film, I pretty much love all of them but I do have 'some' limitations.This one does enough to stay on the good side of the ledger.What works, the effects (mostly) and The Rock.
What doesn't, The Rock and the Disney-fying of anyone dying.What do I mean? The Rock is hit and miss in this one, he pulls of some great scenes whereas others are just a bridge too far (he may have caught this from Fast Furious). The effects are excellent. The deaths are sanitised for perhaps younger viewers, the cost of this is tension and any real concern you may have had for the family. They are obviously going to come out ok so we don't have to explain anything to the kiddies!But a disaster movie is a disaster movie so thumbs up from me!"
" Words fail me
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,1,"Terribly bad acting.
Completely predictable and mind numbing.
One star because it was sorta cool watching all the buildings fall."
" An average disaster film
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,7,Technical effect of the film is spectacular. But the plot is very weak. Storyline is too weak and illogical. The male lead is like a superman with great power. Everytime he manages to save his family just by coincidence. The scriptwriter fails to produce a storyline that justify male lead's successful rescue. No wonder the overall rating is below 7.
" Oh for crying out loud
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,1,"Who pays to see crap like this?First of all, there's a reason we have earthquake codes. To withstand big shakers. Does anybody remember the World Series earthquake. Sure, lots of damage and some loss of life, but entire buildings weren't crumbling.Blonde ditz who is texting while driving does not fall a thousand feet end over end in her vehicle, slam against her steering column and live to be rescued. She'd be dead five times over.Hoover Dam better not crumble in a relatively pathetic 7.1 or the residents of Las Vegas are in serious trouble, never mind all the tourists who visit the dam every day. Oh, and how does Bart Giamatti's kid get back to the office so fast? The parking lot at Hoover Dam is on the far side. Did he hitchhike?Horatio Hornblower playing a real estate developer with a fake American accent. If he's got all that kind of money he's not chasing a mediocre 40-something with sanded-down skin.The obnoxious Limey engineer wannabe and his even more obnoxious kid brother. Does anybody have any idea how heavy concrete is? A couple of little dweebs like that would be lucky to lift a bag of dry cement, much less a collapsed beam. Oh, lucky they have the tire jack from a 1987 Honda Civic nearby. That'll do the trick. How I wanted to bash their heads together.Rescue-chopper pilot Dwayne Johnson attempting stunts that wouldn't succeed if he practiced them a thousand times. And then he flies into downtown San Francisco and just happens to spot his wife on a rooftop? I have better odds of winning the lottery.And instead of landing at a nearby hospital helipad and dropping his wife off for emergency medical attention, The Rock decides he's gonna, what, fly into the basement to rescue his daughter?I don't care how big an earthquake it is, the No. 1 rule is: If you're inside, stay inside. If you're outside, find a clearing and stay outside. What you don't do it run outside where you're going to be killed by falling concrete and glass.Arrrrrrrrrggghghhgh. And I'm not even halfway through this dog.Arguably the stupidest disaster movie of all time."
" All about Johnson......... Again
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,2,"Okay I get this is a disaster movie, but at least make it a bit realistic. I mean if a building I'm in is crumbling the last thing I'm gonna do is have a conversation about how much I love someone. RUUUUUUNNN!!And yet again as with most of his movies, it's all about him."
" Decent but not amazing
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,7,"Despite some really cheesy acting and some very OTT CGI, this is definitely worth a watch. Not the best disaster movie ever made, but certainly not the worst."
" Best Desaster movie.
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,10,"Its a excellent Desaster movie.
Its contains lot of Desasters like Earthquake, Tsunami and more.
And the Rock(Dwyane jhonsen) gives lot of action thrill in movie.
Overall its is best movie."
" The action is fun, but the story is awful
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,5,"As a disaster movie it stands tall on bodycount by essentially wiping out all of California's coast. The spectacle along the way is a CGI cornucopia, but that's where the awe begins and ends.I love The Rock. Funny, strong and charismatic. He's the true action hero but this movie turns him into a transportation expert who mansplains his way through commitments of grand theft auto.As the destruction unfolds, and an earthquake scientist (a wasted opportunity of Paul Giamatti) holds a Q&A while government leaders are nowhere to be found, The Rock (Ray) takes his county issued Search and Rescue helicopter on a recon mission to save his freshly ex-wife. Take a minute to process the absurdity of this trained medic flying over millions of people dying in buildings and on the streets to save his ex without as much as wondering if, maybe, the search and rescue team could possibly use the chopper he's joyriding with.Of course the razor thin plot has their daughter in peril 380 miles away. She reports that mom's new boyfriend abandoned her when in fact only the audience knew that he walked off after being shellshocked while trying to get her help. Mom calls his cell (from the stolen chopper) and wishes death upon him. Little morbid when you realize the real story.So dad flys the helicopter toward San Francisco, but of course the rotor fails. Instead of setting it down in and unpopulated area - like I dunno, the ocean? - he crash lands into a crowded store increasing the bodycount via collateral damage. The looters don't seem to care there's a helicopter in middle of Walmart leaking fuel as the anti hero dad and mom steal a previously stolen truck. The lazy writing helps people beyond the ethics question because, it's fine, it was already stolen.Meanwhile the daughter and her newly minted boyfriend of 30 minutes are on a mission to high ground. She knows everything about first aid and fire truck equipment, ""my dad is with search and rescue"" she claims. Well she passes thousands of desperate people running in the streets waving their arms. Clearly her dad's selfishness was also inherited.The daughter (Alexander Daddario) spends the duration of the movie breathless. After the action begins she can't belt out a single mindless line without breathing heavy. This occurs even as she stands still to share her incredible knowledge of what to do in this emergency, to two people.Back to dad and mom, well, they they've just stolen a plane. For a trained medic watching the world literally burn 5000 feet below is fine as long as you go find your daughter in the chaos of millions dying. So, The Rock makes it to San Francisco and realizes he can't conveniently land a plane, so time to skydive! The plane goes on magic autopilot as the two leap from the side door with no concern of where the plane will crash and how many more people he will literally kill.The daughter and her soulmate of 1 hour find a tall building to escape the tsunami as dad steals a boat, passing thousands of dead floating bodies (not shown but would be true) to save the girl.Part fish, The Rock rescues her underwater and saves her and the love of her life, and his little brother.Now our heroes get to higher ground, where oddly, only about 100 survivors made it to, as he hugs his estranged wife and Mensa member daughter proclaiming they'll simply 'rebuild' as the entire 2000 mile coastline is annihilated.5 for the spectacular destruction
0 for the storyThe lazy writers should be ashamed of themselves."
" 20 minutes of GREAT destruction, surrounded by 80 minutes of below-average script and acting.
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,5,"I have always loved disaster movies. They are almost all terrible, but they are often on the leading edge of special effects. And I'm talking about all the way back to Irwin Allen's TOWERING INFERNO or even back to GODZILLA. As a kid, those movies blew me away with their awesome destructive power! In recent times, films like DEEP IMPACT or TWISTER breathed new life into the genre, featuring what are now pretty dated, but were once pretty advanced, effects. I enjoyed 2012, not for it's great script, but for it's outstanding scenes of global destruction (and Woody Harrelson's delightfully unhinged performance).So I prepared for the same guilty-pleasures with SAN ANDREAS. But it let me down to some degree because the ""non-destruction"" scenes were particularly dumb and unbelievable. Bad script, bad characters, bad acting. Dwayne Johnson can be quite a charming actor and he seems on the surface to be well equipped for an undemanding lead role like this. He will never win an Oscar, but his physical presence and charm should have tided him over. But his part was SO painfully cliched and by-the-numbers that even The Rock crumbled under the weight of its high school level writing. It was as though a child had watched a bunch of disaster movies and was told to write the dialogue to be like all those. Or perhaps it's more accurate to say that it felt computer-generated. No soul...just plot points to tick off. Estranged ex-wife and her new husband who is clearly doomed to die (yep, just put Carla Guggino in Amanda Peets' role from 2012). Attractive daughter in distress, causing Johnson to abandon his role as a search and rescue guy when the world most needs him? Check. Cardboard scientific characters will little purpose other than explaining to us the ""science"" of what is going on in a vain effort to lend credibility (thinking DAY AFTER TOMORROW here). Check. A ""cute"" kid who is spunky but still needs a bit of rescuing? Check. A romance developing out of nowhere when everyone ought to be focused on things like staying alive and the end of the world (thinking the POSEIDON remake). Check.Add to that some truly dreadful performances by Guggino and Alexandra Daddario (as the daughter), along with embarrassing turns for Paul Giamatti (as the ""scientist""...hope he got a good paycheck) and Archie Panjabi as ""the TV reporter."" Just not good.Fortunately, the movie is still watchable due to its scenes of destruction. There is perhaps 20 minutes here of truly jaw-dropping special effects work as we watch major cities crumble to the ground in spectacular fashion. This is the stuff viewers like me come for. And SAN ANDREAS delivers. (I watched in 3D...the 3D is okay, but I don't think it adds so much that you should go out of your way to see it in that format.) The CG cities are convincingly rendered and more convincingly toppled. (Things get dicier near the end when Johnson and Guggino zip around on a speedboat through CG debris. They never quite look like they're really ON the water.) So I enjoyed those moments very much. They are just as rote and predictable as everything else...but as I said, I take guilty pleasure in these movies.So, for me, it's 3 stars. If you DEMAND good scripts and acting from your disaster movies...keep looking. This is perhaps a one-star film for you. And if you have a higher tolerance for bad writing and acting, then this might even be a 4 or 5 star movie. So take my thoughts in their context. If I watch this movie again some day, I'll be skipping MANY scenes and just cutting to the chase of some great destruction!"
" Really enjoyed it
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,10,"Wanted to make certain I gave it the highest rating because too many haters are out there. This was an awesome film. It harkens back to the classic Disaster Movies of the 1970's like Earthquake, Towering Inferno, Posiden Adventure, and others. Others are saying it was just too cheesy. Well, that's what it's supposed to be. If you went into it to find a great drama, well, you watched the wrong movie. It's a Disaster Flick, plain and simple. The only Acadamy Award given to this one should be Special Effects. They were EPIC! When my wife and I saw it (in 3D in the theater) we were on the edge of our seats (my wife especially so, and she didn't wanna see it). It was a thrill ride and I loved it, chees and all."
" Horrible sets and thin plot
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,1,Sets look cheap one step away from an adult movie set...
" Guilty Pleasure
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,8,I always watch this film whenever i'm bored. Love it. Amazing actors
" A CGI show in an entertaining film.
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,6,"""Another earthquake film in which California will be obliterated."" That's what I thought when I discovered this film. I was not mistaken. It's just another disaster film, similar to so many others in its mistakes and virtues: it's stupid, but it entertains wonderfully.Against the backdrop of the famous ""Big One"", the devastating earthquake that hangs over California like a Damocles Sword, the film follows the efforts of a veteran of the Los Angeles Emergency Services to save her own daughter in San Francisco, in a story that is perhaps the most odd I have ever seen in a disaster film. He totally ignores his professional duty, selfishly choosing to save those who matter to him instead of presenting to his service and saving as many lives as possible. Of course, in the midst of all, he saves other people, if he were not the hero, but it was not what motivated him. And of course, the daughter proved to be totally capable of getting away with herself when everything seemed like the Apocalypse.The cast is led by an actor I have never particularly liked, Dwayne Johnson, but who has risen considerably in my expectations since he proved to be more than just a muscle mount. He's not brilliant, but he has improved and choose more carefully his roles, gaining with that. Here, he does what he has to do and gets along reasonably well, but he does not establish any chemistry with Carla Gugino, who plays the ex-wife he still cares about, and who seems to be acting with a wall instead of a human actor. Paul Giamatti is a noble actor who is used to dignified characters and with a certain charisma, and he had everything he needs here. Alexandra Daddario, on the other hand, brings to the film a dose of charm and fun in the feminine, in addition to a beautiful curvaceous body.Personally, I think that what draws the most attention in this film, in addition to the most comical moments that lighten the tension, is the massive dose of CGI where the film spent a notable slice of the budget. And California has never been more beautifully devastated! The CGI is wonderful and there are visually extraordinary scenes that make us think that only in a movie can someone escape by a hair for a wall falling the next instant. With the massive dose of destruction, so realistic that we can smell it, and the decent work of the cast, the film makes up for any defects with solid entertainment and acquires value for that very reason."
" Watched this based on Daniel Radcliffe's recommendation in Hot Ones
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,2,"Holy crap, what was Mr. Radcliffe smoking when he said this was one of his favorite movies from Dwayne Johnson, especially the comment he made about getting emotional with the family matters. Seriously? This movie is absolutely horrendous, and extraordinarily predictable. The acting was bad, the effects were not amazing, the story was poorly executed, and there were several completely pointless subplots.I wish I hadn't watched this."
" Terrific special effects
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,7,... Unfortunately the dialogue writer failed 5th grade.This a movie that it is so bad it becomes comical and appears to be a disaster spoofInteresting that the leading actresses brought their special effects to their roles
" Absolutely Nauseating Heroics
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,2,"With its PG-13 rating it's no wonder that ""San Andreas"" turned out to be such a pathetic dud. This $110 million production offered the viewer no form of intelligence, whatsoever.I mean, the only reason for watching ""San Andreas"" was to see its scenes of mass destruction. And, yes, they were impressive - But, after a while it all became so hopelessly predictable and downright boring-to-the-max. (Yawn!)"
" Very good
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,8,"An awesome action movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Again it is a great movie about doing anything for the people you love. We thought the special effects were amazing, and I was swept away, totally mesmerized by the story. We thought the whole idea was very cool and loved watching the movie and understanding more about real life natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis."
" This was bad bad bad.
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,2,"Do you like movies where hot people continually make terrible decisions. Well do I have the movie for you. This film is about a earthquake but it's like people stopped trying to write a script 1/3 of the way through and just said. "" let's have the thing do the thing and blow up the thing while people run around screaming each others names"". Also *spoiler* somehow the rock saves his Daughter after drowning underwater through the power of love? I mean it's stupid but hey look that one ""villain"" you forgot about got crushed by a container BOO HOO Also this movie has a happy ending? I mean what? Just cause the hot girl survived I'm supposed to be happy millions of people died when this clown of a rescue worker was savin this ex-wife who left him for a rich guy from a burning building? This movie insults the audiences intelligence. Simple. The comic relief in the form of an annoying little kid is rarely a good idea. Look this movie is bad have I not stressed it enough? Good things? Not many for sure but the rock is OK as usual and ............... yea that's about it.If you have not watched it idk why you would bother but considering this movies gross you already have. It is sad to me that actors with potential are being put to act in movies like these.
2/10"
" Juvenile movies
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,1,"Silly and comic - that is the best this movie can be explained. Mother America had just 5 good people and one bad man. Earthquake comes at its will and tsunami comes and the great hero conquers it with cletch of jaw. Helicopter ridesat will, laser beam that unites the family amongst all the destruction, pump and pump and a cough and an ounce of water completes the movie. If you are adult are teen you will wonder why these movie guys thought you are so brainless. Crawling babies may find it amusing!"
" Exciting but vapid
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,2,This movie is scientifically cringable. Volcano was more believable. Thoughts and prayers for the cast who have to live with this POS.
" Pretty good film.
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,8,Not a very original story but it was well executed and the special effects were good.
" What were you expecting!
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,9,"This is film is bad I'm gonna say it, but I love it because of that. I mean it's a diaster film what were you expecting."
" Ehh
",2020-09-10 00:00:00,5,"I like Dwayne Johnson movies. They all are actually pretty good, for the most part. It's always a fun time for me at least. This one is like that I guess. It's good, perhaps even worth a watch.Give it a try5 stars"
" One of the few drama movies that I loved!
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,10,"Dwayne Johnson and Alexandra Daddario play in this movie !!!!!! Do I need to say anything more?
Just Amazing!
(Sorry if I write the names wrong!!!)"
" The Rock saves the World
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,3,"Of course he will save everyone (living) who matters to him. He's the freakin' Rock? He can outrun earthquakes, falling buildings (in a helicopter, no less!), a tsunami, and God knows what else. When there is no real suspense, what does it matter how many perilously close calls the hero and/or his loved ones encounter? We know they're all going to come through stronger than ever. I guess I'm old-fashioned, but CGI effects, no matter how well done, just look phony to me. The destructions of L.A., San Francisco, and points all around and in between are quite spectacular, but the aforementioned CGI disconnect prevent any real sense of peril for any character that really matters. The one death with any emotional resonance occurs before the movie even begins. Paul Giamatti gets to emote directly into the camera, but even that seems fake and ham-fisted. And he may be the highest-paid ""actor"" in movies, but his major accomplishment is looking buff and tough while flying planes, helicopters, swimming inside a building, etc."
" Great Special Effects
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,8,"Well done to the Australian production and special effects. Although OTT this was a fun watch and a disaster movie on steroids. I hope the sequel will do less of the American cheese and more of a realistic story of survival as most who have experienced disaster know the pain and reality that others need to see. Please learn for 'The Impossible' & 'Aftershock'
I am a big fan of disaster movies, so keen to see them evolve"
" Good effort
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,5,"It's a movie about tectonic and siesemic quacks.. However, not all the ""jiggling"" were so related."
" Pure fantasy

" Ignore the science and it's a super fun movie
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,9,"This is one of my favorite disaster movies, the visuals are amazing, it keeps you on your seat start to finish and the females are intelligent."
" See what the man does for the wife leaving him
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,7,"This isn't a classic movie and it has lots of cgi. It's not terrible but it's not something really great either. For anyone who has been through a real earthquake (I've been through 3 of note, 1 of which I consider ""real"" meaning things collapsed) will likely appreciate the action and find a reason to go where there aren't any.It's interesting though that the guy who's wife is divorcing him without hesitation goes to her rescue even though she is horrible in leaving her ex-military and current first responder husband. The story line between the daughter and brit was fairly interesting and entertaining because of Ollie.Worth watching but not necessarily going out of your way."
" Bad storyline
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,1,"A tragedy hit a town. But a first responder not only not getting any calls but he choose to save his family while ignoring everyone else while using government resources. Only good thing about movie, a brother made good money outta it."
" Pins & Needles!!!
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,7,"When I saw this one in the theater I was literally on pins & needles thru a good
portion of the movie (yipe!).Good performances from Johnson, Gugino, Giamatti, and D'Addario (as well as the 2 brothers,, no clue of the names). It's a disaster movie,, so plenty of action and intensity.So go watch it!!"
" Just what you'd expect! Give it a chance!
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,8,"I don't know what these people giving 1 star reviews expected, it's a disaster movie starring The Rock. It was always going to be choc full of special effects, predictable and at least a little cheesy!
I found it thoroughly enjoyable, kept me gripped the whole way through which doesn't happen often and was a perfectly good film in my opinion.
Not every movie is going to be an Oscar winner, sometimes you just want a little escapism and to be entertained, this does just that.
Ignore the haters and give it a go!"
" A REAL SATURDAY AFTERNOON CGI STINKER
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,1,"What an insult to anyone with a brain. Every scene is super predictable. Every single line is cheesy. All the building crumble like dust when in fact they are engineered to withstand most of that. Typical divorced parents who lost a kid thrown back together in love after all odds of finding anyone in this level of mayhem much less their daughter whom manages to contact Dady from a landline to his helicopter. And why was kylie minogue only in it for 2 scenes. Films such as these infuriates me, as you can tell they cost so much to make"

" I was rooting for the buildings to 'win' !!
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,4,"The usual OTT acting, combined with the predictable storyline and usual ridiculous 'managed-to-get-out-of-the-way-at-the-last-second-to-escape-from-peril' scenarios all help to spoil some actually quite gripping special effects. The man who can fly and drive anything, plus his wife who can emerge almost unscathed from any situation, as well as the daughter and friends that managed to select the only building that wasn't on fire and didn't collapse, make for truly unbelievable watching. Add in to that crystal clear water with no bodies floating in it and not much debris either, and the final package is just annoyingly far removed from what would be the reality. SPOILER ALERT: I thought a bit of reality was going to set in when the daughter got trapped, but no, she survived too. Just skip through this film to enjoy the special effects, but don't waste any time watching the rest of it. It gets 4 stars for special effects (probably out of 4) and zero for the rest, hance 4/10 overall. Pants!"
" New standard of stupidity
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,1,"The film is one big cliche from the first frame to the last. It's an insult to human intelligence, taste and common sense. It's a disgrace for our species.

" When an earthquake meets the Rock
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,9,Yes this film is over the top but that is what we love about it. Dwayne Johnson and the rest of the cast are brilliant and the story of the family trying to get back together is fast paced and exciting.
" You know what you're watching, just admit it!
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,5,"What more can be said? It's typical Hollywood summer fare. The only reason I'm here, is to nominate Carla Gugino as the ""American Sophia Loren."" She's close to her fifties, and though she isn't the angelic temptress she was, in her early career, she's aged extremely well. Like Sophia, Carla doesn't have that spectacular of a career, but she's well established in both TV and film, having been in the business close to thirty years.
""San Andreas"" is just another exaggerated family/personal melodrama dressed as something that just exploded in the microwave. It's only saving grace, is Carla Gugino. Even with the world exploding around her, I couldn't take my eyes off of her."
" Decent disaster movie
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this one probably more than I should have, a really decent disaster movie. I remember wanting to see it in the theatre, wish I had, the CGI is done on an epic scale. I particularly liked the shots where the entire city is moving as if on a wave as the 9.6 quake hits, and the container ship hitting the Golden Gate bridge after the tsunami. Some cool helicopter stunts as well amid mass destruction of San Francisco. Yes there are also many far fetched and unbelievable scenes but all in its super entertaining.We follow The Rock as a helicopter pilot who races to save his daughter and estranged wife as a series of massive earthquakes devastate California. Meanwhile Paul Giomatti as a Cal tech professor attempts to warn citizens. I'll probably watch this again."
" Good graphics indeed
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,6,Yes it is cool graphics amazing directing you will see breathless scenes in that with acceptable acting and story you will expect the events as you walk with it despite that you will be excited.
" FACTUAL ERRORS
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,7,"1. At the beginning, when the professor is talking about past quakes, he identifies the largest in N. America as a 9.1 in Anchorage, Alaska. It was actually a 9.2 and its epicenter was off the coast near Kodiak Island.
2. Tsunamis are caused by submerged subduction quakes, not by the slip-strike quakes of the San Andreas. Even under water, a slip-strike does not have the sudden and powerful upward ""push"" that a subduction quakes has."
" A FUN MEGA BUDGET POPCORN DISASTER MOVIE
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,7,"This was a fun movie & a mega budget blockbuster summertime popcorn movie, the type of fun Saturday night movie to watch with the family like i did & just sat back & enjoyed the huge expensive action scenes of mega destruction & a the always great Action star Dwayne Johnson, leading us through a destroyed America on a rescue mission.
Gotta say Dwayne Johnson has become a huge mega star action hero just like Schwarzenegger during his glory days & Johnson embodies that old school big hulking action hero for a new generation of movie fans & for a new generation of movie making, big mega budget c.g.i fests.
This is a well made & exciting Natural Disaster movie just like the old school films of the 70's & 90's with a much bigger budget & scale. Johnson makes a great lead hero again & I've loved alot of his films lately such as Rampage, Skyscraper & his Jumanji films, He's one of the greats & here he plays Rescue Helicopter pilot Ray, he's a troubled man full of regret & turmoil & he plays it fine & has to come to the rescue of his ex-wife & daughter during the huge earth shattering disaster of the San Andreas Earthquake. There's excitement, suspense & Amazing scenes of destruction & it's a huge affects heavy move but an epic effects movie that is a perfect Cinema good time or an Saturday night popcorn good time, it's just a big fun survival adventure & nothing more but that's fine as it's a wild & fun ride with Amazing scenes of destruction.
Dwayne Johnson is Awesome"
" Nice Effects, Terrible Acting
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,5,Good special effects and CGI. Awful directing from Brad Peyton and thus lousy acting. Dwayne Johnson was very predictable. Carla Gugino was good but definitely not her best work. Alexandra Daddario looked awesome. Art Parkinson's acting was terrible.
" A Disaster Of A Film !
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,2,"WOW ! It actually took 2 brains to write this yarn !! I thought that California (and San Francisco in particular) had very tough building regulations regarding earthquakes ... and yet whole buildings - old and modern - seem to collapse like cardboard !! Still, for a film with a few shots on location and the majority by digital animation (?) it probably managed to pay the cast's wages ..."
" Fun disaster movie
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"While it is a bit cliche (even for a disaster movie), overall, the film is fun. One of the great things about it is it manages to be campy, yet serious. There are moments that were unintentionally hilarious because they were overacted and far-fetched, and yet it works. It's funny that ""The Rock"" is in a movie about an earthquake. The movie is a great mix of humor and drama. Amidst all the destruction, and death, and people running for their lives, there's still the occasional funny one-liner. It feels a bit like the movie ""2012"" at times, but that's a good thing, because I liked that movie. This film is the kind of film where you just turn off your brain for two hours and let the visual effects do the talking. Nothing more than that. If you try to take the film seriously, you probably won't enjoy it, but if you watch it as what it is, a film meant to be fun and nothing more, you will enjoy it more.
Grade: B 8/10. 3.5/5 stars"

",2020-03-05 00:00:00,7,"A standard disaster film, nothing all that unique about it.With that said, 'San Andreas' makes for a fun enough watch for the majority, thanks to the special effects and the strong cast - Dwayne Johnson and Alexandra Daddario being the standouts."
" Goody goody
",2020-03-04 00:00:00,8,"Unfortunately, this not an adaptation of Grand Theft Auto, but rather, a disaster movie from the studio behind Into The Storm.The Rock plays Ray Gaines, a rescue helicopter pilot for the LAFD who lost a daughter but is lucky to have the other one (Alexandra Daddario) love him very much... despite the fact he and his wife (Carla Gugino) aren't together anymore. Gugino is now dating Reed Richards from the '05 Fantastic 4 film. Too bad Mother Nature has other ideas, as the notorious but also real San Andreas Fault has finally shifted, causing the biggest earthquake the state's ever seen. And they've seen a lot. Now, Gaines and the ex must rescue Daddario after Reed chickens out, not knowing that she's on her own adventure with a handsome boy and his little brother.The effects, brought to you by Brad Peyton, are hands down... ok. The actors were a little wooden, even though one of them wasn't made of wood.San Andreas. Probably makes for good background noise while playing San Andreas."
" Clichés after clichés

" San Andreas Review for class
",2020-02-10 00:00:00,10,"I watched San Andreas for my class on natural hazards and disasters. I payed special attention for disaster movie stereotypes and information, then decided if this would be realistic or not based off what I have learned so far in my class.
San Andreas is an epic tale of The Rock (Ray Gaines) saving his family during the largest earthquakes ever recorded in history. Being aptly prepared for his task through his time in the marines as well as being the LAFD search and rescue helicopter pilot, he manages incredibly dangerous natural hazards. Not only does the Rock (Ray) rescue his ex-wife from a collapsing skyscraper due to an earthquake but performs incredible feats such as safely landing a crashing helicopter, rides a tsunami wave like a surfer, and saves his daughter in fantastic fashion. Some of my favorite scenes include when The Rock pilots his rescue helicopter, such as in the opening scene. I also enjoyed the skydiving scene, as The rock was very non-chalant about the whole ordeal.
Some of the scenes that I found to have interesting ""believability"" factor would be the Hoover Dam earthquake scene, the whole Caltech storyline, and the tsunami scene in San Francisco. In the Hoover Dam scene, I enjoyed the instance where before the dam breaks, you can see an emergency release of water. I believe this might happen as the dam seeks to maintain an appropriate pressure. However, this believability dissipates quickly as the main scientist stands literally feet away from the broken dam as literal tons of water woosh past him. I think the whole Caltech storyline was a bit hokey, as they found a foolproof way to predict earthquakes through aa precursor magnetic fault. This is just blatantly not true but makes sense insofar as the main plotline. I also think the tsunami scene in san Francisco is hilariously over exaggerated. I was laughing super hard when The Rock rode the tsunami wave like a surfer in his boat. Many of the action scenes I feel are made to be more fun to watch rather than scientifically accurate.
If the world's largest earthquake had hit California, I do not doubt the massive destruction it would cause, and the temporary collapse of society on the west coast would certainly occur. However, I do not think that we would be able to predict and notify the public like they do in this movie. It would be a tragic event that the world would remember. However, I feel that maybe the earth would not split open like in the movie, nor there be mountain tall tsunami waves. One thing I think the movie did a good job depicting however is the role of heroes. I believe people will step up in times of crisis just like The Rock did. If I had one takeaway from this movie, it's the importance of being a first responder and taking action."
" It's escapism, not a documentary.
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,9,"A highly enjoyable piece of escapism, brilliant special effects and decent acting from a strong cast.
From some of the reviews which nit pick tiny details or inaccuracies, that's not what movies are about and have not been since the days of Max Sennet or the Keystone Cops. It's all about the improbable brought to the screen, lighten up people!
The film follows a fairly standard formula, a back story, action coupled with great special effects. An unlikely hero saving the girl, the cowardly step father and reunion of the main characters which are nicely handled
I remember films such as 'Towering inferno', hailed as a classic not because of the acting, back story (which was somewhat turgid) or accuracy of the locations, but because it had great effects for its time and just provided escapism and entertainment."
" Thrills and escapism are what disaster movies are all about. This one hits the spot.
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,10,"This movie has it all. Great special effects. Characters you love and root for. Characters you hate and want to punch in the face.The story is a simple one.

" CGI does not a good movie make
",2020-01-14 00:00:00,2,"It was eye rolling from the start, with the first completely unrealistic ""accident"" and just went downhill from there. Each ""catastrophe"" got more ridiculous. Every character was one dimensional and the fractured family saved by getting together in the face of the deaths of millions, a tired overused trope, was especially nauseating.
I don't know who were the lost people giving this movie a 10, minus ten is more like it. Did they work on the film? Lame. CGI, and not even good CGI, doesn't make a good movie. Especially one that has a shamefully weak script. It wouldn't matter how good the CGI was, it couldn't have saved this horrible mess."
" Very low expectations and it's still garbage
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,3,"Well, it's a disaster movie, what're you gonna expect? But this one takes all the bad tropes and cliches of disaster movies to the max. Every single character is a stereotype from start to finish, the dialogue is vomit inducing, the story is preposterous and the movie would be best served by having no dialogue at all.The visual effects are at about the same level of previous big budget disaster movies from many years ago. They're so-so, it just completely takes you out of the experience the fact you can spot the green screen plenty of times.Three stars - One for the Rock just playing himself as usual and one each for Alexandra Daddario's pair bouncing around whenever possible.Seriously people, this cost 110 millions dollars and there is better amateur content on youtube. I've no idea how it made close to half a billion. Guess ""family"" means gullible."
" Good disaster movie
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,7,"The show did well depicting the aftermath of a large earthquake in the US. I find the graphics are very well done, so is the filming and storyline. It does have more of a fun feel to the movie then a deep series one. The only thing that really brought this movie down from being a great film, was the acting. Carla Gugino and Dwayne Johnson were terrible choices for this film. They have no chemistry and Dwayne Johnson is all muscle, nothing heartfelt or deep about his acting. The only belivable actress is Alexandrea Daddario"
" Yes its cheesy. But enjoyable
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,7,"Cheesy? Yep. But who cares. You should know that the moment you step in. Enjoyable? For sure!

" Breathtaking and spectacular disaster movie with big name cast and decent special effects
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,6,"In the aftermath of a massive earthquake in California, a rescue-chopper pilot . Raymond Gaines (Dwayne Johnson) searches his estranged ex-wife (Carla Gugino) who is about to marry her new suitor (Ioan Gruffudd) . Both of them make a risked journey across the state in order to rescue his daughter Emma (Alexandra Daddario) . Meantime , the researchers Dr. Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti) and Dr. Kim Park (Will Yun Lee) from the worldwide geophysical Caltech team are investigating strange events and learn that the earth's core is heating up, as they travel to a dam to control their seismic studies and there is a strong earthquake collapsing the dam. Later on , an earthquake causing death, destruction and wreak havoc. They fight for saving a fraction of the city's population, but the entire big town is doomed , as the citizens to escape the impending cataclysm. Along the way Raymong struggles to find a way to save his family. This impressive quake has an awesome and destructive power enhanced by the overwehelming special effects and digital sound. Ever have one of those days...? Pray you don't.Where will you be, who will you be with? San Andreas. We always knew this day would come. Then a series of global catastrophes threatens to annihilate mankind and unprecedented eruptions and earthquakes of unprecedented strength wreak havoc all around California. We Were Warned .Who will be left behind?The end is just the beginning. Geologists predicted it...Now, science has confirmed it...but we never imagined it could really happen. Mankind's earliest civilization warned us this day would come...Ordinary catastrophe movie in thrilling and vintage style with all star cast dealing with a huge earthquake outbursts at the noisy city of San Francisco .
Acceptable disaster movie paced in fits and starts with a great cast, though a little wasted . The plot summary centers in a valiant pilot who goes to look for his daughter and a sismologist who predicts disasters , fighting amount of dangers because of San Andreas Fail is cracking . The F.X. of computer generator are first rate , better than the classics 7o and 80 :""Earthquake"", ""Inferno towering"" and likeness to ""Volcano"" or ""Armaguedon"" and ¨2012¨. Thrilling screenplay dispenses absurd excitement as well as spectacular scenes and lots of action . This is a fast-paced, stylized disaster-spectacle film with noisy action , thrills , chills and strong images of destruction and chaos. In addition , cinematography and musical score are breathtaking . The impressive , state-of-art special effects and the good cast cannot save this passable film , at all . It lacks deep characterization , displaying some boring moments and a tiring script that was presumibly well paid . This was a successful catastrophe movie that belongs to disaster movie genre that in the 70s and 80s achieved splendor , such as : ¨Towering inferno¨ , ¨Poseidon¨, ¨Beyond Poseidon¨ , ¨The swarm¨, ¨Avalanche¨, ¨The Russian rollercoaster¨, ¨Avalanche express¨ , ¨Airport I, II, III..¨ and whose main representative was producer Irwin Allen . All of them packed primitive and traditional special effects , with no computer generator effects ; nowadays , these catastrophe movies are plenty of 3D FX , showing breathtakingly realist images . Main cast is pretty well, giving understanding interpretations , such as : Dwayne Johnson as pilot Raymond Gaines , wife Carla Gugino , their daughter Alexandra Daddario and Paul Giamatti . Support cast is frankly good such as Daniel Riddick , Ioan Gruffudd , Archie Panjabi , Hugo Johnstone , Art Parkinson , Will Yun Le and brief appearance by singer Kylie Minogue .It delivers a colorful and evocative ambient thanks to an expert cinematography cameraman by Steve Yedlin . As well as a frightening , suspenseful and moving musical score by Andrew Lockington . Being lavishly as well as efficiently produced , and competently directed by Brad Peyton . This non-sense but enjoyable disaster movie was decently directed by the Canadian writer/producer/filmmaker Brad Peyton , though with no originality and it has some flaws and gaps . Brad Peyton is a good writer , producer and filmmaker who has directed a few acceptable films , such as : ¨San Andres¨ , ¨Journey 2: The Mysterious Island¨, ¨Project Rampage¨ and ¨Incarnate¨ and he is shooting San Andreas II . Rating : 6/10 . Passable and decent catastrophe movie"
" Unnecessary
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,1,Bad acting and very clichee and unrealistic. No surprises and everything including the love story is extremely predictable and boring. While half the skyscrapers in the City crumble into pieces the only one who makes it to the top and finds her right away. Seriously? I usually like the Rock but this is probably his worst movie.
" You think this is bad?
",2019-09-10 00:00:00,7,"You think this San Andreas movie is bad? Well, then I suggest you watch the other two ones. Those you'll like. Yes. Probably give it a 10 too. Probably...

",2019-08-06 00:00:00,3,"I enjoy watching dumb B movies because they're either so bad they're hilarious, or purposefully dumb & bad, so that the audience is in on the joke.San Andreas was a disaster movie fan's wet CGI dream. Every scene and second without the main cast was decent. Every time one of them did or said something, I got an aneurysm. It's sad that this movie earned more than Blade Runner 2049.I know it's meant to be a popcorn flick, but the dialogues were awful and moronic. The screenplay was written by a mentally underdeveloped person. At least 2012 wasn't THIS dumb. This was a great unintentional comedy. Also, Alexandra Daddario is a terrible actress."
" An exciting, over-the-top disaster movie
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,8,"This big-budget disaster movie sees Dwayne Johnson playing Raymond Gaines, a rescue helicopter pilot with the Los Angeles Fire Department. His wife is filing for divorce and her wealthy new boyfriend, Daniel Riddick, is taking Raymond's daughter, Blake, to San Francisco because he has to fly to Nevada after an earthquake destroys the Hoover Dam. Seismologists soon realise that it is a precursor to a massive quake that devastates Los Angeles and causes major damage throughout California. Raymond manages to rescue his wife and the pair head north to save their daughter. She is now with a pair of British boys, Ben and Ollie, the older of whom was in the city to apply for a job at Daniel's firm. Then an even larger quake strikes San Francisco; Blake and the boys must head to safe higher ground and hope Raymond can get to them.If you are looking for realism you are in the wrong place but if you just want an exciting roller-coaster ride of a movie where the protagonists survive a succession of disasters by the narrowest of margins then this is the film for you. The opening scene features a daring rescue which serves to introduce Raymond. After a very brief lull to introduce his family the action proper gets started. This begins with the spectacular destruction of the Hoover Dam and then escalates as we see Los Angeles and later San Francisco decimated; buildings collapse and famous landmarks destroyed. Dwayne Johnson impresses as Raymond Raines and the rest of the cast are solid even if the characters are for the most part playing second fiddle to the special effects. These effects looked fantastic on my relatively small television; I imagine they would have looked amazing on the big screen. Overall I'd say that this is well worth watching if you want a thrilling ride."
" San Andreas vibrationally shakes its cast off the ground and into implausible, unlikely and downright lucky situations.
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,4,"Disaster films have never been my pleasure, heck they're not even my guilty pleasure. Films designed to showcase state-of-the-art visual effects, masquerading a plot that is, more often than not, stupid beyond belief. Ding ding! Oh, looks like we have a winner. This blockbuster measured a magnitude of ""purposefully preposterous"" on the Richter scale (and yes, I'm aware it's a numbered system...). A series of earthquakes caused by the San Andreas Fault pummels a helicopter-rescue pilot into traversing the entire western coast in order to save his ex-wife and daughter before a skyscraper falls on them or something.As endearing and heroic as The Rock is, I hope his character got fired after this event. He only saved a handful of people and wasted so many precious minutes attempting to reignite his internal flame for the Gugino sex bomb, that his loyalty and priorities were skewed right from the first camera shake. Screw the public asking for assistance! Right, let me start by saying the film succeeds in what it sets out to do. It's a mildly entertaining popcorn-munching effects extravaganza that harks back to classic 90s disaster flicks. The visuals were decent, the main cast members were charismatic and the much promise of a British chum dissecting the etymology behind ""Nob Hill"". What more do you desire? One could ask. Oh, I don't know, maybe some genuine logic that doesn't perpetuate geological absurdities?I'll start with Giamatti's seismologist. An obligatory character used to accentuate the ridiculous behaviour of the fault line. On several occasions, the reporting team constantly interviewing him say something like ""he tried to warn you, but no one listened"". Umm...excuse me, miss. Yeah. As soon as he discovered that he could predict earthquakes, the whole frickin' country started to shift. He never had time to warn anyone! So don't paint him to be this angelic hero, he left his friend to die on the Hoover Dam because he couldn't be bothered to run towards him. Instead, much like with every line Giamatti shouted, he rampantly screamed ""Take cover! Run! Get to the barriers! It'll be over soon! Run! Run! Earthquake! Run!"". Oh, but then you get lines like ""Right now, I wish I were so wrong. God be with you..."" as if he's part of Europe's 'The Final Countdown' music video! Calm down on the epic stares, dear. Your overacting is hurting my eyes. Never mind the science that was mind-bogglingly underdeveloped and unexplainable.Then we get to the main cast, the Gaines' and their two British pals that Talk like This because They musT pronounce all of Their Ts in The mosT Typical BriTish accenT of all Time. Naturally, with a plot as absurd as San Andreas', there are so many moments when these characters escape death just in the last second of a building collapsing or a helicopter crashing, that you start to believe that they're incarnates of religious deities. No one is constantly that lucky. If Kylie Minogue pummels to her death whilst inhibiting her native Australian vocals for an American accent (actually not bad!), then no one should live. Mr. Not-So-Fantastic makes an appearance as the film's mandatory selfish meanie, which only provided one excellent phone call from Gugino regarding her daughter. The tsunami sequence contained an absurd amount of noticeable green screen that I felt my eyes artificially becoming blinder by the minute. Oh, and how could I forget about the introductory sequence with the girl in her car, and the helicopter managing to balance itself in the tight crevice of a canyon whilst her car is locked into place vertically by a few pebbles. Say no more, say no more.Anyway, I know what you are all going to say. ""It's supposed to be dumb fun!"". And sure, I cherish ""dumb fun"" like the rest of you. But there is only so much dumb I can take before I start to question the logic and realism that the film exhumes (hint: none). There's only so much destruction before my mind becomes numb to it. Despite some catastrophic visuals and a dependable cast, San Andreas shakes its plot too ferociously for its own good. The last ten minutes being a prime example of that."
" Laughable

I predicted the Asian kid would die but throw the girl, the step dad would be a bad guy earlier, the step dad would abandon her before it happened, the rock would see his daughter's face give up hope like in the story he mentioned but this time succeed in saving her. Also why would he wait until she stopped breathing to try his hardest? and the movie has to either let her die to make it sad or save her to make it happy. You can't drag it out that long to get both."

The massive guy that comes to the rescue of everyone is unbelievably cheesy. There is so much disaster that it all becomes pathetic. Buildings falling, everything crumbling down, yet the characters still manage to avoid every single danger by the very last second. So many scenes are way too predictable. This movie isn't exciting at all, I didn't feel scared for the main characters, it simply it boring."
" Review of this film
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,10,"San andreas is an action, drama, thriller film directed by Brad Peyton and stars Dwayne Johnson, Carla Gugino, Alexandra Daddario, Ioan Gruffudd, Paul Giamatti. The film tells of a rescue helicopter pilot who must try to save his daughter during an earthquake and tsunami raged in California. San Andreas is the name of a fracture or cracking ground in California, United States which has a length of 1200 km that separates the Pacific plate and the North American plate. This resulted in an earthquake that occurred on April 18, 1906 at 5.12 am in San Francisco. Some 28,000 buildings were destroyed and 3000 people died in this incident.My first impression was before watching the San Andreas film, I thought maybe a film like a film about natural disasters that had often been played and the types of disasters needed were also used in previous films, for example a 2012 film that visualized disasters and collapsed buildings saw the kind of disaster which everyone would love the type of disaster classified as often displayed in previous disaster films, more than the 2012 film showing all kinds of chaos from the type of disaster that only collapsed buildings, earthquakes that split the ground, large tsunamis, and up to the eruption of the mountain very awesome.However, after I watched this film, even though the film was still themed earthquake, the earthquake visualization presented here was very detailed in the results. Starting from additional animations such as the tsunami disaster that involved, the sound effects were very mesmerizing and able to enchant the audience to always be complicated in every scene, really like listening to a large collapsed building in the middle of the city, all of which looked challenging, looking for a very good every place even though some of the place settings are forced or not suitable. But all of that can be played, the acting of the players who can be said to be very capable in covering the story of Ray's family drama, Dwayne here appears not like in the previous films, not just moving the biceps like the fight.Behind the advantages of this film, there are some things that I think are lacking in this film. For example about a shelter under a compilation table an earthquake occurs. Taking refuge in that way is an old way that has been rectified and carried out to do. Likewise, saving yourself to the roof of the building, isn't going down and out of the building. In addition there are some place settings that I think are too many that cause it don't match what is done.From the film we can take a moral message that is, don't always think negatively about our spouse even though he has had a big mistake, maybe all of these things have been arranged by the creator of the universe and it is not easy to give up because something will not lie to our hard work . In addition, many other moral messages are implied. In my opinion, this film is highly recommended for watching with family."

",2019-03-10 00:00:00,2,"I would've given it a 3 until the cheesy kiss between the older English boy and the daughter. Or maybe if the 2 guys tag teamed her. Other than that, this was an exercise in boredom and every other disaster movie cliche. Utterly ridiculous premise and no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I want those 2 hours of my life back"
" Typical, Predictable, but Visually Superb
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,6,"First of all, it's a disaster movie. So a corny storyline is a given. The visuals are spectacular and I found the film extremely easy watching.I could have scored it more, but found too many details irritating, over the top and typically American... ""The biggest earthquake ever recorded!!!""... One man capable of ad travelling an entire state (on almost every mode of transport availble) to save the two most important people to him... and a few more along the way...Despite this, it's still an easy watching and entertaining watch."
" Nothing Earth Shattering About This
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,6,"When titular star Dwayne ""The ROCK"" Johnson helms a film the audience expects big things, and ""San Andreas"" delivers in that context. However, this being said, nothing earth shattering depicts the nature of the film and it's played again plot line. A Fire/Rescue chopper pilot (Johnson) along with his ex-wife played by (Carla Gugino) go on a desperate search for their daughter (Alexandra Daddario) as a super earthquake rattles California bay area.The CGI is top notch with the destructive force of what the earthquake does as followed by a tsunami. The audience gets to share the horror and shock value of destruction. A seismologist working with Cal-Tech played brilliantly by (Paul Giamatti) delivers what the world needs to know information wise before these forces hit. The film is driven by the Rock's stardom and prowess, action, drama, suspense intertwined through the films core."

" The Fault In Our Stars
",2019-02-13 00:00:00,5,"Wouldn't even waste a review on this movie except I couldn't resist the catchy headline. Those of us who grew up in the 70's remember when disaster movies were all the rage. (Towering Inferno, Earthquake (in Sensurround!), Airport, Posiedon Adventure, etc) In those days before CGI the special effects were part of the reason to see the movie. Today, I've become so used to sensational effects that it's hard to get a ""meh"" out of me. What's missing here is characters that we care about, atypical storylines and solid suspenseful moments. (Moreover, after 9/11, watching crumbling buildings and terrified crowds just seems ironic. We live in a world where the unimaginable is all too imaginable.) Dwayne Johnson is essentially beefcake throughout. Paul Giamatti is wasted. Alex Daddario is watchable but not enough to save this overly cliched snoozer."
" Unbelievably bad!
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,2,"Ok the special effects are something else which is the only reason I gave this a 2 rather than a 1. But believability? Zero. Story? Zero. Plausible situations? Zero. It actually had me laughing. Even wishing they would just die so we could end this misery. Can't believe it wasn't nominated for Razzies. You can either choose to avoid this film or if you really want a 2 hour time waster you came to the right spot. At the end Dwayne Johnson says ""and now we rebuild"". Begs why. And please don't say so we can do this this all over again. California Dreaming? Pfft!"

" Average disaster movie
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,5,"San Andreas is a very predictable and generic disaster movie full of all the clichés a disaster movie typically has. The CG, whilst really good for the most part, dips in quality in a few scenes. It's still enjoyable overall due to a reliably great performance from Dwayne Johnson, a good supporting performance from Paul Giamatti and the huge amount of destruction you expect from a disaster movie."
" Totally implausible!
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,3,"The potential for entertainment value of this film is severely tempered by the persistently implausible action, behaviour and events right from the start! The idea of fiction is to ""suspend disbelief"" but it was simply too ridiculous throughout. The CG was pretty-ish though also obvious in many scenes.The plot is quite shallow."
" So Bad It's Wonderful!
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,1,"I've just watched it on our TV and thank the Lords Of Kobol for the commercial breaks, which gave me a few priceless moments to wipe away the tears of mirth and blow my nose.Every disaster movie regulation heavily contrived perilous moment, every clichéd line of script was here. It never let up for a moment and the whole movie was so awful it was hugely entertaining.I knew we were in trouble in the opening scenes with the dopey girl driving a winding mountain road and, in the face of oncoming traffic, reaching, and looking, into the back seat for her water bottle. Then, having survived that moment of utter idiocy, she gets her cell phone out and starts reading texts, still on the winding mountain road and in the face of oncoming traffic.From there, things got worse. San Andreas lived down to everything I expected of it and, so far as I was concerned, the highlight of the wretched thing was any shot of Alexandra Daddario's cleavage.One star from me and that's only because Dwayne Johnson was in it."

Have this lousy movie play in the background while you are making out with your GF/BY or as you are doing work around the house.Its not worth your full attention as the acting is bad, the scenes are about as realistic as Star Wars, the CGI leaves a lot to be desired and the plot is so blatantly predictable."

I've always loved a good diseater movie (2012 excluding), and this was no exception. I have seen the previous reviews, but what did you all expect? It's a disaster movie which has been well made. The special effects were great and the Rock didn't annoy me half as much as I expected.
It was a heart warming story of a parents love to save their child. It definitely touched me and I totally believed the story and love they shouted for them."

",2018-11-19 00:00:00,8,"Most of the criticism of this movie seem to be by people who expected this to be a high end drama or Shakespeare ( not that I like Shakespeare, I find most of it boring) but this is a simple disaster movie not meant to be taken too seriously.
On that basis, it isn't half bad!
I agree there are plot holes and many scenes are pretty unbelievable but so what! It's just a movie."
" Not impressed
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,2,"Very poor and very predictable movie, the hero saves the day. the only good thing in this movie was the special effects. Poor acting from some of the cast and some of the scenes were just so unbelievable like jacking up the car to take the weight of the girls legs, ha ha, these just happened to be a reinforced metal bar just about the right length and had no concrete attached to it right by his side, he didn't even need to look anywhere. There's plenty more pathetic scenes like it too. Terrible movie."

And the final triumphant, puffed-up declaration by our hero, after being asked what comes next: "" We'll rebuild"". I need a barf bag."
" Makers of this movie have never been to San Francisco
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,3,"Other than the ""non-memorable"" disaster aspects of this film, the geography of it all makes absolutely zero sense. Being a San Franciscan, the most unsavory aspects was how apparent it was the producers took no thought into researching this movie and if the plot made any sense at all. Small script revisions could have given this film a chance but I'm guessing they hoped that anyone who viewed the film had never even visited San Francisco before."
" The Fault Within the Fault
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,9,"Earthquakes lead to tsunamis when your near bodies of water and you don't want to be caught in either one. In this action-packed and American disaster film, starring Dwayne Johnson, Carla Gugino, Alexandra Daddario, and Ioan Gruffudd you won't be able to take your eyes from the screen or stop yourself from sliding to the end of your seat.
 Dwayne Johnson plays Ray, the father and also the man in the helicopter who saves people in distress because of course he has to be a hero with all those muscles. Alexandra Daddario plays Blake, the daughter that is going to college. Carla Gugino plays Emma, the mom. Ioan Gruffudd is some what of the bad guy in this film, he's seeing Emma and offers to take Blake to visit her college and when the disaster happens he's no where to be found. This eventful movie centers on an earthquake caused by the San Andreas Fault, this nine magnitude earthquake is destroying Los Angeles to San Francisco. Ray and Emma set out to save their only daughter together.
 I can picture myself now on the couch with the smell of butter popcorn filling the room as chills run up my spine as I anticipate the next screen. I can't believe my eyes or ears as a lone tear falls. You'll never believe what happened but I don't want to spoil it watch the movie.
 I've read previous reviews and lots of critics called it another typical disaster movie. I, however do not agree it isn't totally about mast destruction of the world. The movie does have a sentimental and very valuable life message. When remove all the destruction you can tell it's very family oriented. 
 Furthermore, I really enjoyed watching the movie it's not your typical disaster movie, the worlds not coming to an end, it's more about the risk your willling to take for your family. I mean we l can't be The Rock."
" Good movie (even though my city got destroyed)
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,8,"I live in San Francisco and it was a bit weird watching it get totally demolished. It was a great movie though, despite all the unbelievable scenes. The Rock is very good in his role."

" Over-sentimental, but the visuals are awesome.
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,6,"Although not a favorite or a classic, the film was (much) better than I expected it to be. (It certainly was a hell of a lot better than that awful '2012'!! The visuals are absolutely incredible, so if this was the only thing you wanted to see in a disaster movie, you've come to the right place. Planning and making this film must have been a huge undertaking. The film suffers from the same cliches as most disaster films do, though, where a failed marriage is saved by disaster. Enough already, Hollywood, find other ways to cause conflict between the protagonists.I thought Alexandra Daddario was particularly good (in the role of Blake Gaines). With a little more film experience I think she should be opted as the new Lara Croft. On the other hand, Ioan Gruffudd was terrible! (but maybe only because his character was such a jerk!).In general, the film was exciting and entertaining, and I'll say it again: the visuals were simply AMAZING!"
" The best disaster movie since Deep Impact
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,10,"The first thing to remember when you go to watch this movie is IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. Just watch it for yourself without biases. It's actually quite fun to watch. The ""big one"" finally hits as the long-overdue San Andreas fault goes off (hence the film's title), triggering a huge earthquake. LAFD pilot Ray Gaines (Dwayne Johnson) and his estranged wife Emma (Carla Gugino) must head north in his helicopter from Los Angeles to rescue their daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario), who is in San Francisco. However, San Francisco is in for another beating - and the largest quake in recorded history.The movie is quite exciting, with an excellent plot (and no, the plot was NOT forgotten). The actors do a good job. The film has a good sense of humour (essential in a movie like this). And, above all, the special effects in the film are FANTASTIC. A definite must-see."

" Typical Dwayne Johnson action packed movie that compromises facts for action
",2018-06-02 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed watching this film as it's your typical Dwayne Johnson action packed movie with enough ""action"" and ""disaster"" scenes to keep you entertained even though early on in the film you start to realise that they have compromised reality and scientific fact for dramatic scenes. My one main observation of this film is that, however much I like her as an actress, Alexandra Daddario's role in this movie seems to be more about how many scenes they could get her in running in a low cut top rather than using her to her full acting potential. Don't get me wrong I'm not complaining about this and I know pretty much the whole story line is centred around her character being rescued but I just feel they overkilled the scenes with her running in a wet or low cut top to compensate for lack of reality and the amount of continuity errors in this film.Over all I enjoyed watching San Andreas with the none stop start to finish action and some very well shot disaster scenes but infeel they could have cut down a bit on The two female leads ""revealing"" outfits and it would have still been a decent fun to watch.Again I'm not complaining about the use of very attractive women in low cut tops but it almost feels like they knew this film wasn't going to be amazing so they tried to compensate by showing a fair bit of cleavage throughout haha.Anyway I enjoyed the film and would recommend it for one of those ""I'm bored and fancy an easy to watch"" film nights :)"
" THIS IS NOT A NORMAL DAY
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,5,"PLOT SPOILER REVIEW???Ray (Dwayne Johnson) is ex-military working for LA Fire and Rescue. In the opening scene, God rightly attempts to kill the world's most distracted driver, and Ray foils the plan with a helicopter that has its own swagger music. In a subplot that never connects, Paul Giamatti plays Professor Hayes at Cal Tech who predicts the big one, i.e what happens in Vegas, happens in LA.The basic plot is the same as an Asylum disaster movie plot. A great disaster happens, and the film concentrates on one typical 2.3 child family trying to come together. In this case substitute a new male friend and his brother for 1.3 kids. The main difference is that Ray is separated from his wife (Carla Gugino) who is going to live with her new boyfriend Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd) and his daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario). Yes I had ""Taken"" plot flashbacks and wondered if they were going to include Albanians. Liam Neeson would have stopped the looters.As far as the plot, I really don't have to say anything more. Unless you are younger than the film rating, you will have the whole thing figured out in the first 10 minutes. Even the action within the scenes are predictable, like the Hoover dam scene hand off.The soundtrack was typical. What separated this from an Asylum flick was the special effects, actors, and lack of insignia gaffs.If you want on overly predictable action/disaster film, this is it.Guide: 1-2 F-bombs. No sex or nudity."
" Science who?
",2018-05-03 00:00:00,6,"This movie is pretty well made, and directed. I think the actors do a really good job at portraying the fear and devastation that would occur if a major disaster event like this occurred. This movie isn't very scientifically accurate. They get the basic understanding of tectonic plate movement and earthquakes, but they have minor factual errors occurring consistently throughout the film. There's also the extremely unrealistic situations that are played off as Hollywood stunts, like riding through the wave of a tsunami, that are completely scientifically inaccurate. If you can get past the educational faults, it's worth a watch!"
" worst acting, predictable plot, special effects ok
",2018-04-12 00:00:00,4,"The director must have gone to some length to find a giant Maori bodybuilding martial arts expert actor who can fly a helicoper, drive a car, fly an airoplane, steer a boat, jump parachute, hold his breath for a minut while swimming and tearing buildings apart but who can't act."
" Solid movie
",2018-04-06 00:00:00,8,"Sure the film is not meant for a huge complex audience or even to win awards, it's meant to be a feel good, suspenseful action disaster movie. There was a lot of negative critical reviews but I, personally, can't see what or where that has come from. The CGI is good and realistic. The plot is fairly solid and the acting is good. Dwayne johnsons performance is good. So are the other cast members. Overall the age rating to the film is agreeable. The violence is not too graphic but not suitable for audiences under 10. Language isn't perfect with one f word and other milder profanity. The film is very intense throughout. Overall my verdict to the film is that it is a very good, feel good, emotional, rollercoaster thrill ride of a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat."
" A perfect popcorn blockbuster
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,7,"This is a great Hollywood movie and pretty sure everyone expects the ""kind"" of movie San Andreas actually is. It follows basically the same rules, movies such as The Day After Tomorrow or 2012 (or any other disaster movie coming from Hollywood for that matter) went ahead before. The daddy has trouble with mommy and the kids are not close when the drama starts. Therefore daddy goes on an impossible mission to save the kid, explosions and destruction follow his path and no matter how troubled the world may be... there is always time for a love story in between, right? The CGI looks cool though and the sound is just fine. You will find yourself surprisingly caring a lot for the main chatacters and San Andreas is a perfect popcorn blockbuster. After all it is a movie that stars The Rock and that is exactly what you get."
" Blockbuster Hit
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,9,Great movie! Nice job Dwayne Johnson and this movie had one of the best scenes of earthquakes. It is a survival thriller and is very fun and I recommend you to watch this.
" All out action...down to a fault.
",2018-02-13 00:00:00,4,"Ok, so what can I say? If you enjoy pure action, high drama and a barrowload of coincidences and near misses then this is the film for you.
I lost count the number of times someone escaped by the skin of their teeth sheer moments before a building collapsed or a bridge or a ship comes careering up Main street.Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad film, it's just all so predictable and gung ho and overly 'YEAH USA, USA, USA'. Sometimes it would be good to watch an Action film that perhaps wasn't quite as far fetched as Hollywood seems to like.
The ease at which buildings were ripped apart like sheets of paper was frightening. Surely in an area such as San Francisco which is in a high risk Earthquake zone buildings are constructed to a standard so as to be resistant to tremors. The buildings here were destroyed like the Three Pigs house of Straw. No building or structure escaped undamaged and that just simply wouldn't happen.Much of the film was well acted, i'm beginning to become a bit of a fan of Dwayne Johnson, he's not a bad actor in the films I've seen him in ( other than the Mummy/Scorpion King which were just really bad films), Alexandra Daddario seems fairly versatile in her acting and done a decent job here... On the whole there were no major complaints about the acting ability of the cast, perhaps the direction left a bit to be desired at times, but you can't blame the Actors for that.Some of the effects were well executed, the rippling of the ground as the tremors struck was nicely done, though as mentioned earlier they went a bit OTT with the destruction side of things.Overall not bad as a film, as a piece of eye candy not to be taken seriously.
But please, Hollywood, can we have a change from the norm. This type of film could be excellent but they rely far too heavily on these coincidental occurrences tightly packed into the 90 minutes and often the storyline ends up lacking."
" A steaming pile of dog faeces
",2018-01-27 00:00:00,1,"A very disappointing and lazy film. It had the usual kill off the ethnic minorities first, shame women for divorcing, stereotypical and boring men always saving the helpless women claptrap that we've become accustomed to. The effects were good, but that's where the compliments end. None of the characters were developed properly, and I had to stop myself from falling asleep at watching the predictable and boring love stories unfold. I was rather hoping that the boring and insufferable daughter Blake would be killed off after being (understandably) abandoned in the parking lot by her mothers boyfriend, but no, there was the bumbling English fool that had just met her there to save her. I stopped watching after that, and I would implore you to watch paint dry rather than turn on this drivel."
" 10 Things I Learned
",2017-11-22 00:00:00,6,"...from San Andreas.1. Buildings, roads and dams will crumble & fail just seconds into an earthquake.2. You only need to be a couple of feet off the main structure of a collapsing dam to be safe from imminent death. 3. Bursting a car's rear tyres will unpin a passenger trapped by an interior car seat.4. Once rescued, aforementioned passenger will be just fine despite being pinned by their legs so tightly they could not move.5. Cell phones will be useless but somehow landlines will still work.6. It is possible to just walk into a small aircraft hanger and make-off with a plane.7. Someone needs to dramatically shout ""TAKE COVER!"" at the onset of an earthquake, you know - just in case it wasn't obvious by all the shaking and falling debris.8. The actors trying to pull off an English accent obviously went to the Dick Van Dyke School of Acting.9. Climbing a 1000ft tidal wave whilst avoiding an oncoming shipping vessel dropping it's heavy cargo is totally achievable in a pontoon.10. Kylie Minogue did not need to be in this movie.6/10 for the special effects. Leave your brain at the door."
" San Andreas is an average disaster film with some impressive visuals and enjoyable performance by Dwayne Johnson.
",2017-11-11 00:00:00,5,"San Andreas: Movie Review.San Andreas is an okay film with some spectacular stunning visuals and effects and an amazing 3D, and entertaining performance by Dwayne Johnson.San Andreas has some epic disaster action visuals and visual style but offers nothing more than that. Dwayne Johnson delivers an enjoyable performance but seems and feel very underutilized at certain times. The rest of the cast and characters feels very underdeveloped. The movie also has some very unnecessary, boring and irritating characters that are totally useless in the film. San Andreas has many flaws and issues. The movie falls back in the terms of story plot, script and character development and lack of script originality in a disaster movie. And some times too much over use CGI effects in the movie makes it little bit of less interesting.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others. Thank You)."
" Just another rehash
",2017-11-02 00:00:00,4,"I can assure you have seen this before, it isn't any different from the classic Hollywood natural disaster movies, apart for maybe the slightly better special effects, but all movies of this sort have outstanding special effects nowadays, don't they?Every single natural disaster film cliché has been taken into account when creating this, makes it look extremely cheesy and very ''american'' with The Rock, of course, being the big, invincible buff guy who saves the day, in this case his family. I mean, the special effects were pretty awesome, but it doesn't have the ''wow factor'' anymore, since we have seen so many movies similar to this there isn't anything surprising. Without surprise the plot is extremely easily predictable and linear, i mean its so predictable you will easily be able to say what's about to happen in every scene, that's if you have seen about 2-3 movies like this.Overall, it can work as a braindead entertainment movie you watch, when you are seriously bored and don't have anything else to watch as it's extremely easy to follow and you don't need to think, just let your brain drift."
" The Worst First Respoonder
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,5,"San AndreasThis is a movie about ""The Big One"", a huge earthquake in California. It focuses on The Rock who plays the worst first responder in the history of first responders. In the beginning they show him saving a young woman from a dramatic car accident without any regard to the spinal injury that she would have had to have suffered in such a horrific accident.Then when the earthquake hits, instead of reporting for duty to coordinate rescue efforts, he abandons his responsibilities and steals a rescue helicopter and uses it for personal use. He's just awful, and I cringe at such a horrible person this character is meanwhile being thankful for the many, many unselfish first responders who help people in need.But it's an exciting movie with a lot of special effects so it's fun to watch if you can stand this evil main character."
" As Typical as Typical Can Be

Send the Japanese construction guys to California; they've dealt with another ""force of nature"" named Godzilla for many years. These guys could have California up and running again faster than you can say sequel. With the film's $474M worldwide gross, according to IMDb, you know there is a sequel on the way: ""Godzilla vs. the San Andreas Fault."""
" Earthquake and a Sunami
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,6,"Raymond/Ray Gaines (Dwayne Johnson) is in the LA Fire Departent Air Rescue when the San Andreas fault causes the mother of all earthquakes and triggers a Sunami.This is another earthquake film in which the main characters are in the midst of divorce and find themselves together trying to save their offspring who is in peril. Great special effects. Good film for family viewing with tweeners on the weekend, has something for everyone."
" An ordinary ""disaster"" movie
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,5,"After a massive earthquake which almost shatters California, a rescue helicopter pilot finds himself in the terrible position of saving both his wife and his daughter from the debris. As nature seems to have yet another shake in store for the people, he must act quick in order not to repeat an event from the past which marked his life ever since.It's one of those movies which has prepared a massive cataclysm for people to endure while focusing on a couple of characters and their fate throughout the fatidical moments. It simply impresses and amazes with its visual effects and CGI, but manages to be below par in every other aspect which is more or less movie related. Besides the fact that the pilot ditches any work related service and uses the work helicopter to save only his family, the main characters seem to have some kind of supernatural powers, those of high endurance to crashes, hits and wounding in general. It get it, it is supposed to be exaggerated, otherwise the movie wouldn't have existed, but it takes this exaggeration aspect to a mind boggling and even logic insulting level, thus spoiling the satisfaction which could have been provided afterwards. I honestly think that you can do it without having such unbelievable events which simply do not bring anything good (maybe irony), because we're not talking about a super-hero movie here.The main characters, on which the whole story focuses, aren't very sympathetic, creating little care from the viewer as far as their fate is concerned. Anyway, being as predictable as this movie is, you won't even think that something bad could happen to them, thus little worries here. I did enjoy some of the actors' performance though. The dialog also has a very important role, but not through its complexity or intelligence, but through its simplicity and complete lack of imagination, almost every line being composed of two or three words or something really obvious which simply stalls the action without any reason. The plot is overall simplistic and linear, managing to be have a complete lack of drama, or at least of drama which can be transmitted to the viewer. If you consider a drama only the fact that a quake struck a highly populated area (of course, movie-wise speaking; in real life of course it would be a massive drama) then it is highly dramatic. If you're looking for drama as far as the main characters are concerned, then you're completely out of luck.As an overall impression, it's just another ""disaster"" movie which has, as most of them, very impressive visuals, but fails in terms of logic, story-telling, characters or even plot. To be honest, I didn't have high expectations regarding it and I saw it just for the visuals which didn't let me down. If you're looking for anything else, you'll have to search elsewhere."
" A below average dumb disaster movie
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,4,"This film has the rock in it which is always a big appeal for me so I decided to see San Andreas and this film isn't particularly good. The premise of this film sees a rescue helicopter pilot attempt to find his ex wife and daughter in the midst of the worst earthquakes in history. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson plays the lead in this film and he is really good in this film. He plays the everyday parent trying to save his kid really well and he also has the charisma to give himself some much needed personality. The same cannot be said for the supporting cast, Carla gugino plays his ex wife in this film and I just never really bought there relationship in this film so it made it really hard for me to care about her character. Alexandra daddaro plays there daughter in this film and I found her performance to be really over the top and poorly written. I also found it pretty hard to care about her character even though the film goes out of its way to really try to make you. Paul giamatti is in this film as an expert of earthquakes and he gives a really over the top performance. There are times in this film when you can tell that he is trying to give a decent performance but then the script comes in and his dialogue creates a really ridiculous character. Everybody else in this film is really cheesy and over the top and it makes it hard to care about anybody other then The Rock. The story of the film is disaster movie generic as they come, there are some decent personal moments that make you care about The Rock which is key to caring in this film. But as mentioned before the plot for this movie is as generic as possible and there are just too many moments that are just sigh worthy. The script as also mentioned before is pretty terrible filled with cheesy ridiculous dialogue that really hurts everybody involved and the film as a whole. The style of the film is really what we come to see this film for and I will admit there are some really cool disaster action set pieces in this film that will definitely entertain. However some of the effects didn't feel fully finished, especially at the beginning of the film there are some pretty bad effects that make this film feel incredibly unrealistic. Overall this film isn't really worth watching at all unless you like disaster movies for what they really are, films to turn your mind off but have no depth."
" Sorry Dwayne!
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,5,"I have to start by saying that I do ten to watch anything that Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is in. For someone primarily known as an action star (and former wrestler to boot!) he does tend to offer *slightly* more range in the acting stakes than some of his contemporaries. Here, in 'San Andreas,' he doesn't have to utilise an awful lot of acting ability to portray a tough-as-nails helicopter pilot who must utilise his aerial skills to save his family when a freak earthquake hits the city. Yes, that's about the size of the plot. Anyway, I knew what I was getting. I've seen enough disaster movies to know the score – the actors normally come secondary to the special effects. And this film was no different.I began by actually quite enjoying the film. It doesn't take long before buildings start crumbling on a large scale and, when this happens, the special effects are indeed well done enough to at least make the devastation appear believable. Plus you have the ever-great Dwayne Johnson at the helm, who, as I've said, is always fun. However, it was about there that the fun started to come to an end.There's little even Johnson and the special effects department could do to prevent not only the city of San Andreas, but also the entire film, from slipping into oblivion. It was about a quarter into the film when I started asking the question: Is this film trying to be serious, or not? You see these kind of disaster movies do follow patterns, or to put it a little harsher, have their own clichés. And 'San Andreas' starts to conform to so many of these that I was left wondering if they were checking every box on purpose in some sort of 'self knowing' kind of way. Sadly, by the end of the film I can confirm that they never had their tongue anywhere near their cheek.Once the disaster is underway, we're also treated to the couple who have split up getting back together, their subsequent inability to die while all around them drop like flies and the search for the child in danger. Now, I could almost forgive all of those if it wasn't for the fact that some actors appeared to be doing possibly the worst British actors since Dick Van Dyke! (Feel free to correct me and look them up online and inform me that they really WERE true Brits – but I'd be shocked!) So, a film that could have been really good fun was only reasonably due to Johnson and the effects. It's a shame that they couldn't have at least tried to make the sub-plots a little more original, as it makes the film pretty forgettable if you've seen as many disaster movies as I have. Plus Paul Giamatti was wasted and only there to try and give the film more of an air of gravitas."
" Predictable with poor special effects
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,3,"The punchlines were predictable and corny, though the acting was fine. When the blond's car went tomahawking down the cliff, it looked really fake, like it was either computer-generated or controlled by a cable. How does the brunette remain scratch-less as she plummets on the roof just long enough for The Rock to pull her up out of the mess with his chopper? And of course the main blond who's stuck in the basement is rescued by the boys who decided they can't leave her (because she's a hottie) and is revived at the end by CPR. If she wasn't pretty, the boys would've said, ""To heck with this, we're out of here."" All in all, this was really predictable, corny, and thriller-typical."
" If you wanted a plot, you've come to the wrong place
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,3,"I'm afraid the opening sequence of this movie sets the tone for the rest of it. Admittedly, some of the CGI within the movie is much better than the pathetic offering in the car crash scene, but there is still very little to offer unless you just want to see mindless explosions and buildings falling down.When watching this film, it was so hard not to compare it to others of the same genre (The Day After Tomorrow and 2012 were the two that sprung to mind). And, I'm afraid San Andreas never gets close to being anywhere near their standard (and they are hardly world beaters!) My main problems are that the character development is none existent which renders you totally ambivalent to any of the characters in the film. If they live or die could not have bothered me less. And also, the cheesy dialogue and overacting is something you've seen a million times before.For me, it is the poorest in a long line of disaster movies that tried to pin it's hopes on Dwayne Johnson, but I just didn't buy into him as this sort of character, so the film was flat from the start."
" Pure action, no acting allowed
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,5,"Compared to The Rock, Arnold Schwarzenegger is like Sir Lawrence Olivier. His acting is like a, well, professional wrestler. The Rock only proves how low we have set the bar on movie entertainment. However in that aspect, this film is long on action, and little else. My ""5-Star"" review is for the special effects ONLY. I doubt that anything starring The Rock would be good for much else; the CGI is mighty spectacular, just as you would expect. It was realistic enough to put you off your trip to LA, or at least re-think it. If I was the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, I'd try to have this movie banned. But if pure violent action, thrills, and mayhem is your goal, this film certainly fills the bill."
" Entertaining Disaster movie
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,8,"San Andreas is another disaster blockbuster action film by director Brad Peyton. In this film he teams up again with Dwayne Johnson, and this film delivers on what was expected. The visuals, stunts and overall disaster action lives up to the content of the trailers. These films are merely to show action and the overall aspect of disasters occurring. The plot and storyline may be weaker but it was decent enough and kept audiences entertained throughout. The characters are great, as well lead by lead action star The Rock, delivering another charismatic strong performance as lead hero. Carla Gugino and Alexandra Daddario play their part well. Although somewhat predictable in the end, San Andreas delivers on thrills, some suspense and is the blockbuster which delivers in until the end."
" A Fantastic Disaster Flick.
",2017-06-09 00:00:00,8,"There are not many decent disaster movies out there, this genre is dying out, but Hollywood still manages to make a few here and there.San Andreas is an entertaining blockbuster CGI-fest, the performances are believable and there are some scenes which will have you glued to the screen. There is one particular scene which proves how some scenes should be made in the history of cinema - the scene where Paul Giamatti is standing there in shock after just witnessing his friend/colleague get swept away in the overwhelming earthquake that is literally tearing everything apart, and the music suits the scene perfectly, speaking of the film score composed by Andrew Lockington - it is brilliant, very catchy and upbeat and worth adding to your Spotify playlist.The special effects are eye-catching, they clearly look fake, but not in the bad-film making sense, you can still watch it knowing it's fake while still finding it very entertaining, if you prefer special effects that look more real i recommend watching ""2012"" instead.The only error in San Andreas is the depiction of Dwayne Johnson's character being a father to a white girl, some people may say ""what does it matter?"", the thing is it DOES matter, if the makers of this movie want people to take this flick seriously, then don't bring in scenarios that will distract viewers from the main story.Overall, still a great film."
" Complete pile of pap
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,1,"This movie is shockingly bad. It is so utterly cheesy and corny it makes you cringe so much that you're doubled up on the floor. Dwayne Johnson cannot save this one.Right from the start it's ridiculous as a young woman in a car who isn't looking where she's going has the most horrific crash you've ever seen and LIVES!! I mean the car rolls about 50 times as it crashes down a massive cliff and she's thrown about like a rag doll but oh she's fine! The movie improves slightly as Dwayne Johnson enters as a superbly talented helicopter pilot and does some nifty moves to save the miraculous survivor. Also the earthquake monitoring people are engaging, the special effects for the hoover dam scenes are very good.However after those initial introductions it all goes down hill as Dwayne Johnson's character pines over his ex (soon to be divorced) wife and is shown as perfect daddy to his model-like daughter. Johnson manages to have a helicopter all to himself and miraculously rescue his own (soon to be) ex-wife and go on a mission to find their perfect daughter together. What a pile of pap. Really."
" Worthless
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,1,The acting was terrible. The story was badly written and completely predictable. The effects are like something out of a Tom and Jerry cartoon. What a waste of time. I couldn't even watch to the halfway point it was so useless. How this got rated higher than 4/10 stars is completely beyond me. I wish I'd never set eyes on this film. It is likely to leave a bad taste in my mouth for weeks.
" What did you expect?
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,4,"Well, what would you do? Millions of people are dying all around and you have an helicopter. Of course, you would want to save your family first. And the Rock Johnson could. Enough fuel in the tank? Who cares! The building is «pancaking» floor by floor. Good thing the wife is on the roof. Much worse for those under. Now find a plane. Nowhere to land but why the hell bother? The mother of all tsunamis is racing toward the city? Jump on a fast boat to try to go behind before it crests. A wife and daughter tough as nail? Lucky man. At least they're worth saving in my book, not like all those idiots who run toward the bay. And why not a little miracle to boot. And, finally, a huge American flag unfurling, brand new, to inspire rebuilding. It would have been much better if it would have been at least a little wet. All in all, good fun. Good CGI. The wimpy suitor is crushed. No time to waste on actors. Don't think too much. A 9.6 quake is nothing to laugh at, but it's only a movie."
" pathetic
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,4,"pathetic movie for dumb audience, don't understand why the hell Rock was only at the back of his family and not trying to save other people from disaster.it is so mean and doesn't suit the character on hulk like Dwayne Johson.only in one meeting with girl the 2nd lead is ready to sacrifice his life to save the girl from under parking and fall in luv with her.does it make sense :D the subject was good but due to poor screen play and story line i will give only 4 starts to this movie and don't suggest people to watch."
" wow...
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,1,"to be quick: all the people involved in this movie (director, producer, writer, actors, FX artists, technicians, chopper pilots, car dealers, toilet cleaners,...) should be banned for life to be involved in another movie. Also all the viewers (including myself who watched at this movie on TV because I had nothing to do on a thursday night) should be sentenced to watch at all The Rock movies (but maybe this would be a crime against humanity)."
" A Truly Entertaining Waste Of Time.
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,8,"This is one of those big Hollywood disaster movies that ticks every box -It's BIG - with thanks to today's computer graphics we can now total towns and cities and open up massive chasms in the earth. We can also fly helicopters through the tumbling skyscrapers and ride speedboats up the mountainous waves of tsunamis. The action and the special effects are awesome, though they do verge and teeter on the edges of ridiculousness.It's Hollywood - the only thing bigger than the effects and the disaster happening on screen is Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's aura. Not only is Johnson a physically immense man but his presence on screen is substantial and powerful. It was mainly due to this presence, humour, and physicality that I watched WWE and I was pleased to see all those essences worked well on the big screen too. As time has passed his acting skills have grown, though he doesn't have to call on them too much here as the film is action and effects driven.As with most movies of this ilk, the story is pretty limited. A family has split up for the day, going about their daily businesses and routines when the earthquake hits. Amid the ensuing catastrophe rescue pilot Raymond Gaines (Dwayne Johnson), must rescue his ex-wife and daughter. This isn't as simple as it sounds, as more buildings fall and water rises the three people have lots of obstacles to overcome before they are reunited.Director Brad Peyton does a good job of tying all the computer graphics and live action sequences together to give a thrilling and entertaining movie that is full of tension. Never did I withdraw from the movie once to think, wow isn't that a great effect; there's nothing worse than when a special effect spoils the flow of the story. That is a great testament to Peyton and the effects team.Though this is Johnson's film the rest of the cast are above average, especially Paul Giamatti who plays Dr Lawrence Hayes who is in the process of developing an earthquake premonition machine.If you like films where you can leave your brain at the door then this would definitely be one for you to watch. If you've had a rough day and need something to relax to then you could try this movie. If you love disaster films then you need to watch this."
" Why San Andreas
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this Movie. And I watched this movie more than 5 times. Dwayne Johnson was really very cool in this movie. His acting level was fantastic. And I also enjoy the present of Alexandra Daddario. She was looking very much pretty and Sexy. I like her Acting skill too. The film has many times of suspension. When the first earth quack come I think it's over but when the earth quack is happening again again it makes the viewers excited and tensed. The scripting and story line up is too good. The most important thing is in this film, Location design and Camera framing. Actually I think so Director is like a scientist, I feel so after watching this movie. Love This movie."
" This movie IS the disaster.
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,1,I was overly excited when I fished my new copy of this utterly ridiculous disaster flick out of the $3.79 movie bin at Wal Mart. I am quite convinced that after suffering through this drivel I deserve a refund of the purchase price; $1000.00 per minute for every excruciating 60 seconds of it's 114 minute run time I lost from my life that I will never get back; punitive damages for the death of many brave brain cells and a signed apology from the director. Take a lesson from my book and avoid this flick at all costs; your gray matter will thank me. This drivel requires a healthy dose of the suspension of disbelief...so much so that the creators could have saved time and the watchers sanity by issuing an emergency morphine pill with every viewing of this cinematic catastrophe. JUST SAY NO!!!!!!!!
" Jaw-Dropping Action
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,10,"OMG! THIS FILM IS EPIC! I love films with Dwayne in because he is an epic actor! I was watching this about a half hour ago and even when my film had finished, my jaw was still dropped wit amazement!I think the same will happen with you if you watch it!Well, I hope you do watch it, I mean, arrgh... ITS EPIC! I cannot get over the thrilling action and effort put in this film! It must have cost millions upon billions to create the illusion of one of the most beautiful cities in the world fall to pieces!Whoever made this probably has a whole skyscraper filled with cash! Well, in fact an underground bunker because all the skyscrapers fell to pieces in the earthquake so, his/her cash would have been tattered and torn and buried beneath the rubble!Anyways, THIS FILM IS AMAZING!!! GO SEE IT KNOW!!I STILL SEE YOU ARE READING THIS...GO... NOW!!!!!YOU WOULD HATE TO MISS IT!!!!GO!!!!10/10 DEFFO"
" By no means as weak as you might expect
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,8,"Let us first acknowledge that those electing to watch a disaster movie do so for certain pretty obvious reasons. So no comparing chalk with cheese. There are quite a few over-lucky coincidences in ""San Andreas"", and a certain number of geological, oceanographic, architectural or scientific implausibilities, but then again one does not watch this kind of film to see real life (and if we want to see terrifyingly real-life images of disasters natural and manmade, we can certainly now do so). Indeed, the makers of ""San Andreas"" (from Canadian Director Brad Peyton onwards) have obviously looked quite carefully at the shocking footage of the two recent large-scale tsunamis (if failing to note that the water does GO BACK AGAIN before too long!), as well as 9/11, and to me the flavour of that they inject into the film is realistic enough.Obviously, the special effects in general make or break a film like this, and - again to my mind - ""San Andreas"" avoids the first and worst trap of useless or cheap effects, while also avoiding the trickier CGI-era trap (heavily fallen into by the new ""Independence Day"", for example) of making the death and destruction look throwaway, wholesale, somehow ""impressionistic"" and therefore inclined to leave the viewer cold. Here, the scale is vast and the ideas for the chaos and catastrophe really pretty innovative, but we are also kept in touch with the fate of real people, who are sometimes at least left with tiny choices about how they can act (notwithstanding some quite-impressive and shocking presentations of instant deaths from large chunks of falling masonry and so on). Ultimately then, I like the way this is done, and would suggest these effects leave this film high up on the list of quality disaster movies.The characters who operate against the catastrophic background must also be a bit crucial to a film of this kind, and here they are enjoyably resourceful, with professions, backgrounds or experiences that have given them a far-above-average capacity to manage when everything collapses. The muscle-bound Dwayne Johnson playing fireman-cum-helicopter rescue guy Ray Gaines does well enough, and the rest of his (surviving) family consists of a beautiful (if estranged) wife played by Carla Gugino, and a beautiful and gutsy (and above all kind) daughter played by Alexandra Daddario. Sweetly enough the latter meets up with younger and older brothers from England played respectively by Art Parkinson (Irish) and Hugo Johnstone-Burt (Scots-born Australian). This leaves us with minor accent problems, but ""the lads"" end up coming across pretty well, in part also because the older brother is trained in engineering (conveniently), while the younger is no slouch in the intellect department, and reasonably charming with it. This group gels surprisingly well, enough for us to see them as more than cardboard cutouts, and enough (I feel) for us to to get wrapped up in their fates...The main other players are Caltech scientists, notably Dr Lawrence Hayes (played by the ever-likable Paul Giamatti). Marissa Neitling has a welcome bit-part in there, Alec Utgoff and Will Yun Lee slightly more major roles, but as a team they look OK, and all the more so when joined by a journalist played by Archie Panjabi. While none but the Doc have that much to do here, there is both a degree of plausibility and sufficient reason for sympathy from the viewer.There's also Kylie (Minogue) in a tiny cameo role (plus), and Ioan Gruffudd as a bad guy (though this time - FOR ONCE - a bad guy played by someone who has dropped his native British accent for an American one). Many thanks for this great step forward, Brad! (All the more so given that the British accents we do have here are among the heroes). More points also for the fact that this is a bad guy who leaves the daughter character to her fate, but also ends up saving her, albeit indirectly. That's a touch of nuance I appreciated, and it's not quite the only one. Thanks to this film, I learned a lot more about a San Francisco landmark which I must go and see one day (having never heard of before) called the Coit Tower. This is not a purely chance inclusion in the film (as those who read up on it will see), and it's nice to see that someone knows their Frisco a bit.Clearly some more things were done right in this film, as I found myself genuinely moved I believe three or four times, and not surprisingly also during the final scene (which is of a kind I personally have always been a sucker for). So then, quite against expectations, I ended up having an enjoyable time with this film, which came over as some kind of cohesive and pretty impressive piece of work. These days, this is not as easy as it sounds with a (reasonably) big budget and CGI-based offering of this kind, but I was won over successfully."
" Proof Positive Humans are Dumb as F#$%!
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,2,"The only reason to watch this blatant, yet worse than, replica 70s disaster piece (as in piece of...) is to watch LA and San Francisco be destroyed along with all of the pretentious f#$%'s who live there with it.Dwayne J. is okay. But really, if your here for the acting...why are you here? Cliché after cliché with heroes and villains and plucky snot nosed side-kick brats and pretty, young, nubile daughters make up this predictable turd of a film. I'm only even mentioning it now because my wife is downstairs watching it and I caught some of it and threw up dinner. I originally saw it when it came out only because my wife wanted to see it and because it was set here in SF, and why would I want to miss seeing a tsunami engulf the entire Bay?It is amazing how much crap movies like this can make a fortune when good thoughtful films are ignored. But I knew this. Hell, I grew up in So. Cal. What did I expect...taste?"
" Burger of a movie
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,5,"I must agree with all the detractors of the movie, and also with all the fans. In a way, I am both.Sometimes one is hungry and wants a burger at BK to fill the stomach and appease the hunger. If you do so, you know that it is not good meat or a good burger, and that the BK outlet it is not a proper restaurant. You don't go there fooling yourself right? But you still go in, grab your cheap burger, eat it and enjoy it.Well, when one decides to watch a movie like San Andreas is the same, with all respect. I mean, didn't you knew how was going to be in advance or what you were going to find? It doesn't matter that the acting is not good or the the characters believable, it doesn't matter that the situations are ridiculously impossible and we already know the end, it doesn't matter that the hero seems supra-human and he is the only clever guy in the whole planet. Nothing really matters, because you will spend two hours watching the Rock and imagining a cataclysm of planetary proportions that we all humans fancy fearing and overcoming for whatever reason our subconscious has decided that is OK to fancy. We we'll delight at that god of a man called The Rock, because he is the sexiest man alive and has muscles that seem created to save the world, or at least me. He is the rescue-me-hero of my fantasies for sure.I watched this movie on a plane, as part of the entertainment program, and I thought it was the right price :) but I was entertained. I had a great time, you know, hunger appeased at BK sort of movie. That is what the producers wanted, I am sure, not high ratings or critical appraisal. There are people hungry for this, and they provide the food. Mission accomplished. I feel rescued, now I want something really good, so I go elsewhere."
