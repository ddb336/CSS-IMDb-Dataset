" A Outstanding Neo-Noir experience
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,8,"I expected a Bollywood masala which will ruin the premise of India's Sherlock Holmes but they did prove me wrong, it was very well made, enjoyable, and surely rare.The story takes place in Calcutta where WW2 is in the backdrop of it, where our own Detective Byomkesh Bakshi is summoned to help find a father who went missing. The premise tangles with every other scene and evolves itself into a more dark and complex one which makes us solve this case. Got a chilling ending, the anticipation, and the chill factor is on, a very good foundation to be a Classic.The movie has got a great cast and they all delivered superbly, the background score and screenplay were very good, the comedy was subtle and promising, the music surprised me a lot which made the movie even more chilling and good. The antagonist is stronger than the protagonist which is very rare in Bollywood and that itself stands out for me. It was a bit longer would've been a 10/10 if it was a bit shorter and tight. Overall a good gripping movie, highly recommend it to y'all detectives(mystery lovers) out there."

" Masterclasss
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,10,Sushant Singh at his Best. Amazing movie. Fabulous acting. Will Surely miss the Legend.
" Good story with bad cinematography
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,6,This mive has a good story. But the depiction and directing was very poor. Susant is as always good. But there were inappropriate use of background sound which was very irritating. The director should have take better coaching on directing.
" Nice

" A Film For Mystery Lovers
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,10,With a lot of mystery and suspense in it has got a good catch to it. Detective Byomkesh Bakshi is a great detective and the Indian version of Sherlock Holmes.
" Best movie in world. Great acting and Real Acting Sushant Singh Rajput
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,10,Best movie in world. Great acting and Real Acting Sushant Singh Rajput
" Fatafati (superb)
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,10,"Everyone did best job.As usual Sushant nailed it. The way he portrayed the character of Byomkesh, just fatafati (superb)."
" One f d best movies I've watched in Bollywood
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,10,Hats off to Sushants performance as a detective..just brilliant acting
" Superlative Cinema experience
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,8,"Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! - 2015Bakshy! Byomkesh Bakshy!.....Boom..., and here comes original Indian detective. the name Byomkesh Bakshy with Y is inspired by the 1993 television serial, but let's not compare these two and investigate Dibaker Banerjee's and YRF's ""Detective Byomkesh Bakshy!""Interesting plot together with Chinese and Japanese intervention in Calcutta of 1942-43, with ongoing world war II in a parallel world that only starts with an investigation of a missing person, the first case of detective Byomkesh. A twist turning ride of deaths and connections that leads to the vicious market of opium with an international link takes the viewer to a not too complicated, but a balanced crime thriller with a good climax. Calcutta of 1942-43 is very well created but don't know why the director did not choose the characters to perform in the Bengali accent, which is badly missed and makes all the characters underperformed. However, production design, makeup, and costume teams did astounding creations.The beautifully perceptible effort made by the Lights and Camera department. You will not see a single indoor scene in the film without dramatic lighting which makes them go wow! and almost all the scenes shot outdoor follow beautiful compositions to capture the subject such as frame withing the frame or use of shallow depth of field with foreground, subject, and background present in the frame. Each and every scene are very very beautifully and adequately shot. Seriously Wow!Dibaker Banerjee and team along with the production of YRF gave us an obvious watch with a superlative cinema experience."
" A very underrated movie
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,10,"So, recently I have watched this movie and man it was worth it! Idk why I haven't watched it earlier. The movie is amazing and it is a must watch! takes you on an amazing, thrilling journey."
" Awesome
",2020-07-21 00:00:00,10,A mind twisting movie. Twists and turn. Detective also is confused. SUSHANT was awesome. Neeraj Kabi is excellent. Rest all did great jobs.
" I really love this director
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,7,"DIbakar banarjee , knows how to build tension .. And his mature sense of direction shows in every scene. Not sure about some of the music used, but I dont think its much of an issue.
a scene that I remeber from the film ."
" Best detective movie out of Bollywood India
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,10,"Byomkesh is an Indian story of a Bengali detective which is based in 1940-50s era and is yet a very sassy portrayal of a detective, on par with Sherlock Holmes. The production is top notch. Direction is good and the portrayal of Byomkesh by Sushant is lively, believable and refreshing. The plot moves effortlessly against the backdrop of Calcutta. This is by far one of my favourite Indian detective movies ! Wish we could have more of Byomkesh, it had a true potential to develop into a series, and certainly needs more in the series, I wish however Sushant was there to portray Byomkesh yet again. The movie while not ahead of its times, was great cinema beyond the mass audience of India, which majorly stupid and consumes bad - brainless cinema."
" Will we ever see Dr Guha's revenge since Byomkesh has left us :(
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,10,I loved this movie. Yesterday I watches Chhichore then Raabta and must say Sushant is a master class actor. There was a TV series of Byomkesh Bakshi years ago and I remember watching it. It was good to see Sushant did the complete justice to the character.
" Same excitement from beginning till end
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,10,An amazing thriller that will literally pop your brain out. Bollywood thrillers lack balances but Detective Byomkesh Bakshi proves that wrong. It maintains the curiosity level from the beginning till end. A must watch.
" Brilliant Sushant
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,9,"Very good movie. Engaging plot, story, cinematography and screenplay. The story is based in pre independence metro - Calcutta as known then. All the actors especially Sushant Singh Rajput, who plays the title role of Byomkesh, actor who played Byomkesh's adversary and the light eyed actress who played the vamp all are delight to watch. Simply worth spending time. It is sad that Sushant is no more but this movie will be his legacy. Generations when they see this movie will fall in love with this man's talent and screen persona. Hope more rise like him only based on merit, talent, intelligence and natural beauty."
" Rewatching and still loving it
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the few movies where I can watch again and again.and still find something to appreciate.
Sushant is brilliant as always, his dialogue delivery is unmatched.
Most surprising character and my favorite was Dr guha, the actor did a fabulous job.
My favourite part was the soundtrack, unusual, especially Janam.
The lead character was said to be based off Sherlock but I disagree. Bakshy was believable and still vulnerable.
I can't find a single character in the movie out of place."
" One of the best detective movie made
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,10,A world class movie... One of the best in Bollywood

" Undoubtedly very Well made movie in bollywood
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,8,"The screenplay is out of the box some movements appreciate for Dibakar Banerjee,production design background score is amezing sometimes directing skils in banerjee we all knows he is outstanding overall. So must watch if you really Love detective spy movies."
" Must watch movie
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,9,This is movie has great suspense . Acting of sushant is one of the best in this movie
" Saving Calcutta
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,9,"One of the few Indian directors that don't fail to impress. The movie is satisfyingly awesome and maybe one of the finest thriller in Indian cinema.
What worked:
great direction, brilliant cinematography and background scores, ambiance and climateNeeraj Kavi rocks as usual. Probably finest performance of Sushant.-great screenplayWhat didn't work:
-maybe a slightly more elaborative conclusion.
Final verdict:
Highly recommended;a must watch."
" Bruuh! This is the best Byomkesh adaptation after Ray's ""Chiriyakhana""
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,9,"Bruhh! What a gore-thrilling, eye-pleasing and heartwarming experience of Byomkesh Bakshy! It's the best Byomkesh adaptation after Satyajit Ray's one, according to me. And Neeraj Kabi, what a guy! Why isn't he getting more international movies/tv-series?
I liked how DIBAKAR BANERJEE gave a Korean treatment to both the screenplay and the cinematography.9/10"
" This is a masterpiece.
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie will be remembered for forever, for everything. A perfect movie."
" Good mystery and thriller movie
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,7,Good outstanding movie based on old classic nice to see detective byomkesh the movie is best of all time good concept and good story line.
" Started slow, ended with a blast!
",2020-02-19 00:00:00,9,"I'll admit, when I was watching this at home, I left the comfort of my couch and was just wandering around due to the film not keeping me engaged. The pacing at the start felt slow but the visuals did kinda make up for it. Though as the film progressed, it got better and better and as the mystery was starting to unfold, I was eager for the final confrontation and was not disappointed when it finally came. The final scene... WOW, it had me yelling in excitement."
" I have witnessed very few good detective movie and this one is one of it.
",2019-10-21 00:00:00,7,"While watching the movie i was amazed to see such a nice representation of Kolkata in 40's. Movies plot is good and revolves around a murder case which leads to something very big and extremely dangerous. Though before the move ends most of the people knows who the culprit is but then also most of us are going to enjoy this one by seeing how the plot takes twist and turns. Overall this movie is good and ended in such a manner that i want to see the sequel of this one, but chances of this to happen is less."
" Amazing movie but horrible soundtrack
",2019-07-08 00:00:00,9,"I give 10 stars for the movie. The plot line was gripping from the beginning. It's truly a detective movie. It makes the viewer the detective waiting in anticipation as to what happens next. Loved it.
The sound track is annoying with heavy metal. The settin of the movie is in the 1940s. One would expect a suspenseful 1940s theme. But you would endip hearing 2018' heavy metal band playing in the background and that's seriously annoying for me."
" 'Ayyyy Bakshy Babu!!! Batao apni kahani' ðŸ‘ŒClassðŸ’¯
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,8,"If you've seen Byomkesh Bakshy TV series or novel or you're looking for something like 'Indian Sherlock' then it's made for you. Some brilliant performances and gripping plot with great screenplay makes it perfect mystery thriller. As a Bakshy Babu fan, you know he will have the last laugh and it totally satisfies you. I wish It's sequel get announced sonner."
" One of the best Indian Movie......
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,9,"One of the best Indian Movie. Amazing. The story, direction, scrrenplay, cinematography and acting."
" Intellectually Stimulating and Visually Stunning
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,8,"Byomkesh Bakshy is one of the most famous detectives in India. The books have been adapted into a popular TV series and a handful of films. I had been staying away from this away since I was afraid of getting disappointed but finally ventured to watch it. It was a real treat! I am familiar with the stories so I had a basic idea of the setting. The particular story shown in the film was adapted from more than one Byomkesh story, making it an even bigger challenge to put on screen.But Dibakar Banerjee has done an amazing job with it. The film is a period piece and is set in the Calcutta of the 1940's. The cinematography was visually stunning and appropriate for the times. The movie was intellectually stimulating as it keeps the viewer on their toes, until the conclusion. There were wild twists and turns and multiple red herrings, making it a good detective story. The actors seemed a little out of place at times as I guess most of them are new faces. The antagonist did a splendid job and Sushant Singh Rajput was good, for the most part. Overall, this was a good period piece book adaptation. Recommended for mystery enthusiasts."
" Director missed the shot but actors gained
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,8,every thing is good but i am giving 8 star but 2 minus for this Dr. Anukul Guha character. he is bit noisy and irritating. may be he was a good actor in Calcutta but for this character definitely not. basically the character is psycho and the hole movie characters are very elegant and classy only except this character.
" Detective Byomkesh Bakshi is a 2015 Indian action mystery thriller, also we can call it as a Indian Sherlock.
",2017-06-30 00:00:00,8,"The Film is based on Iconic Character created by Shardindu Bandyopadhyay in 1932.The movie revolves around a Detective who needs to find out his clients father and the story is set in Pre Independence Calcutta during World War-2.Byomkesh is a North Indian Bengali fresh out of College agrees to Investigate the disappearance of Bhavan , a Chemist. who has been termed missing by the Police. This One is Byomkesh's first case which is assisted by Bhavan's son Ajit. Byomkesh links the case to large conspiracy which is thread to all of Calcutta.The Screenplay of the movie is written very beautifully by Director Himself Dibakar Banerjee and the Co-writer Urmi Juvekar, the script is very compact.Its a delicious dark story and requires patience to watch we have to indulge Director Dibakar Banerjee as He Indulges himself the opening sequence stuns you and then the story telling goes static.The Lush Camera work by Nikos Andritsakis is appreciable and the sound track by Sneha Khandwalkar, the sound design by Allwin Rego and Sanjay Mourya & Art Direction by Sachin Bhoir everything is done amazingly and most of all beautifully detailed production design by Vandana Kataria even the stains of the wall of the boarding house where much of the action takes place are artful , each frame has been crafted amazingly.After Interval the pace picks up and the film climax is in bang. what starts out as an innocuous missing person's case turned into battle for Calcutta.It's fascinating to see Byomkesh evolved as the case does. He is confident throughout the whole movie and Imerges wiser and lot more mature. It's demanding role and Sushant Singh Rajpoot more than delivers , He is consistently Impressive as is Neeraj Kabi choose up the sameAjit Tiwari as Ajit Bandyopadhyay does amazing as Bhavan's son who assisted Byomkesh. I also enjoyed Swastika Mukherjee as the sexy and mysterious actress Angoori Devi.If I would have to choose to watch one in between Fast and Furious and Detective Byomkesh Bakshi which was released on the same day then I will choose 2nd one as its an Amazing Indian Detective movie and the credit goes to Dibakar Banerjee and team.If I would have to rate it out of 5 then I will give it 4."
" A fast paced Sherlock style film !!!
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,8,This film is amazingly fast paced .....when I say fast paced ... it is really faaassst ... u really have to focus hard to understand the dialogues and keep up with the narrative . Old world charm of 1942 Calcutta is beautifully captured .. literally takes u back in time ... khoob bhalo . Sushant is great as Byomkesh . The story signals the start of an illustrious career of one of India's most famous detectives. He is supported well by the rest of the cast who perform their roles ably . I would like to see many more sequels from this franchise. My verdict- A nice clean movie for the entire family.... can be difficult to understand at times because of the sheer pace at which it moves. Read a bit on Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay and byomkesh bakshi on wikipedia ( though not a must) to enjoy the sheer brilliance of the Satyanveshi ( seeker of truth).3 1/2 stars for this great effort and hope that we see more of our very own desi sherlock holmes in the days to come.
" Great rendition of detection in an Indian context
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,7,"Direction style borrowed from Guy Ritchie and others but without a doubt gripping story line with all sub plots making sense. Except the horrible experimentation with the soundtrack, this movie should walk away with a sequelSet in 1944 Calcutta with Japaneses invasion anticipated, the story portals British in an interesting light. this is connected with the numerous silent uprisings of the bengal region which had intellectuals go ahead of the non violent plans of the MahatmaBomkesh though portrayed well in the serious parts, has a goffy resemblance to Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes. He carries the suave of a undercover, but lacks the empathy towards women. This along with the sidekicks definition role should be followed with a sequel for the simple fact that Bomkesh lived until all his hair were grey and in this picture was given his 24 year avaatar."
