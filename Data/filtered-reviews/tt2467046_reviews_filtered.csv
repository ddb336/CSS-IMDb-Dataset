" Quite shockingly bad - save your time!
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,1,"There is nothing - NOTHING - to redeem this film. The script is simply awful and the acting doesn't even try to rescue it.If it's meant to promote Christianity, I'm pretty sure this has the opposite effect. It is in fact a deeply depressing view on a warped Christianity and it's saddening to think the screenplay writers could be so misinformed and capable of such gross generalisations. And it doesn't stop at Christianity either, there's the horrific slur, not just by implication, but directly, of the token Muslim on the plane, clearly badged as a potential terrorist and one of the 'bad' ones. There was a point when I though this might be a comedy after all, but nope, I quickly realised it was not funny (or clever) on any level. I've not even started to consider the multiple implausible scenes here - the other excellent reviews do a great job of that. This film should never have been made. The money could have gone to good causes. Or just another film."
" Better than expected
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,8,"If you're into the topic (doesn't matter if you believe in it), it's a very good adaptation.I felt the desperation of the people who can't be with their loved ones anymore. I would hate it to be in this situation in general, staying alone - Actually, this made me emotional. And I've never seen a movie so far that tried to portrait it like that; the fear of being left behind."
" A new ""worst of all time"" for me
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,1,"I thought I would never see a worse movie than ""Armageddon"". Unfortunately I have now. Leaving aside the questionable religious element the production values are soooo bad. Nicholas Cage may have done this as a favour for his brother, a priest, but unfortunatly he has been dragged down to it's subterranean level."
" Not the worst film ever
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,7,"Unpopular opinion here, I enjoyed this film, and no, I'm not religious. Luckily I hadn't read any reviews before watching it, so had no expectations going in. Most of the acting was fine, effects were OK, there was some tension, and I cared about some of the characters. I even liked the ending. Sure there were some dumb things, but no worse than the average leave-your-brain-at-the-door Hollywood action movie."
" Fell asleep after 15 minutes
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,1,"Awful movie. The pace was slower than a garden snail, the dialogue was boring and the acting very ordinary (Well it is Nicholas Cage after all).
Would highly recommend not bothering."
" 8/10 0ut of pity for Nick who now clearly needs a better agent
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,8,"This production was brought by those who will not be able to avoid eternal damnation on the rapidly aproaching final day of judgement.
Enough said."
" Terrible in every respect
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,1,I'm not a Nicolas Cage fan and this script only really focuses on a plane crash. It's nothing like the book. Don't bother.
" Oh dear
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,2,"This is bad -even for Nicholas Cage. Like the outtakes of the outtakes of Con Air, only much, much worse. Unmissable, if only to set the standard for bad films that I managed to sit through, which is why it gets two stars and not one."
" Wasted time...
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,1,By far the worst half of a movie i have ever seen.. and i used to be a Nicholas Cage fan...
" ...and so it ought to have been... on the cutting room floor!
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,4,"Despite the recent calibre of Nicolas Cage films, I saw this was directed by the legendary stuntman Vic Armstrong, so though I'd give it a go. Well, in this season of goodwill, please let my suffering spare your's. It's a dreadful mash-up of stories and films as our airline pilot hero takes off for London on his birthday. We might all have got a wish on this special day but sadly, only half of the passengers mysteriously disappear over the Atlantic so we are left with the remainder vacillating between panic, fear and some sort of theory of divine intervention before they partially collide mid-air with a drone sent up by the script police and the plane has to limp it's way towards a landing... Chad Michael Murray must be there for his looks, he contributes very little else and the underlying theological theme the story takes is just plain preposterous. Surely Mr. Cage must have settled his bill with the IRS by now?? Utter tosh!"
" A good movie!
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,10,"This is an exciting, humourous and moving story. As someone who tries to be open minded to different interpretations of the Bible, different religions and is fascinated by the spiritual, I found this a very compelling movie."
" Horrendous
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,1,"Worst movie I have ever seen, period.
Who do I bill for my time that has been stolen ?
Nick Cage, how did it come to this ?"
" The worst film I've ever seen
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,1,Awful and I don't have more words. Avoid see it if your time worth.
" Left Behind
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,10,I am sure this will get your attention. We hope you enjoy
" It reelly is that bad
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,1,"I only wanted to see this movie because I love the series ""The Leftovers"", this movie has the same theme and from the beginning it is clear it's a rippoff. It is clear that the amount of money Cage is in dept in, is so large, he literally takes on every B or C movie they make, he is even worse then Seagal. The acting, the story, the directing, it is pretty bad, I guess all the money went to Cage. For a really good disappearance story, you really have to watch The Leftovers."
" Really?
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,2,I saw the original movie and read all the books. I was skeptical about this movie. I had a feeling it wasn't going to really follow the book. I was right.
" I thought this would be good....
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,2,"But was sadly mistaken.I really liked the idea, but within minutes knew it was a Christian nonsense film. Children disappearing in their parents/families arms, in front of their eyes, just for those people to run around searching for said kids. They were with them but for some reason they thought they where in the hospital or had gone home. AKA I saw my dog getting run over and killed by a car but the body went into a ditch so I better check every pound and rescue centre around.The movies characters were overly stupid. I was more interested in Nicholas Cage landing that plane."
" Nice siesta
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,1,During the first 20 minutes I had to check twice if I was watching this one or a 90's absurd romance movie. Epic disaster.
" An Honest Review
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,1,"There are even FEW Christians and Conservatives (with the exception of Ned Flanders) that actually enjoy Christian and Conservative movies... or at least Christian movies.There are a lot of exceptions with Conservative films, Dirty Harry, Red Dawn, they can be fun.But Christian Films... MAYBE The Passion of the Christ, The Bible miniseries, Mysteries of the Bible if that actually counts....... Movies like this are the reason. Nicolas Cage was once a big star and oh the mighty fall, now he's in a remake of Left Behind that, honestly, I only watched to rip into, I walked into it with low expectations of Fx that wouldn't look cutting edge in the 70s, of acting that is both too earnest and too forced (and that is without Cage) to look naturalistic. Audio quality that...... yeah, OK, shockingly the audio quality was a step above most Christian movies.In other words, it stinks, you know it's going to stink because movies like this are more about the message than they are about the entertainment.But... that was 2014 and, as Hollywood piles quota onto quota and demands that creators hit check marks that have nothing to do with the story, I suspect that it will change soon... my guess is that people that want to make entertaining films are going to gravitate towards this genre, towards low budget outside of Hollywood fare, towards whomever is offering up the money and is willing to allow them to make a film they want to make and not a political propaganda film.It was made in 2014, and like all the other movies in this genre it sucks. But Hollywood is working on changing that and forcing talent out... and the people that funded Left Behind will jump at the chance of getting actual talent behind their projects."
" Don't be fooled
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,1,"I thought the premise sounded vaguely interesting, but then noticed it was a Nicholas Cage, and it seems he only does really sucky movies. I decided to chance it anyway. The problem is, the premise is swiftly abandoned in favour of a rehash of countless ""oh no we have to land the plane"" dramas."
" Not good, but you still want to wait how it ends...
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,4,"Well, after reading the reviews that it was the worst movie ever my son and I decided to watch this on a lazy Sunday afternoon.
It's indeed not that good. I missed Otto the autopilot from Airplane and you wonder every time: when will Leslie Nielsen wish the main actors good luck. ;-)
But we sat through it. Wanted also to know how it would end. They could have made more of this movie than this. And I guess I have seen worse movies: The last airbender recently.
Is it worth the watch? Well to check out what other's say it might and that made it interesting enough to go and watch this one."
" Bad storyline!!
",2020-09-25 00:00:00,3,"It's entertaining somewhat, The acting is okay, they should have at least used the storyline from the first left behind movie (even though the pre-tribute is nowhere taught in scripture) at least it's free on Amazon prime so I didn't waste my money"
" One of the worst choices for a movie night
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,2,"This movie (if it can be called that) is something I would not recommend even if I would get paid to do it. The story is flat, soundtrack completely mismatched, the actors play badly (Cage included - a shame for an actor like him), the dialog is completely farfetched, is full of simplistic clichés and stereotypes. And I could go on...
The first 40 minutes are deadly boring and the religious part is obvious and maliciously conceived. Typically for a propaganda production. Long story short, a very poor movie (and choice).
I was lucky (to say) that I (difficultly) watched it at home. Otherwise, I would have demanded my ticket money back. Awful! 😒"
" I like this film.
",2020-09-08 00:00:00,9,"It's nowhere near as bad as some are saying, yes it's about religious stuff but if you can look past that it's 2 hours of good entertainment with some good acting and decent action scenes.
I thought it was good anyway."
" Comedy or was it just a pretend serious comedy? You decide!
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,1,Well I watched some of this movie but I could not suffer the poor acting through the entire production. It was only the pure comedy of it all that kept me watching it to the point that the movie became too silly! At one point I was thinking it could have been labelled as a brilliant parody if there was something to match it with as an alternative serious version. Really not worth your time. Oh lord please leave this one on earth!
" man..............
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,1,"Really dude? Nicolas Cage? Why, this movie is awful. Dang near no stars. Awful movie."
" Nick magnet to terrible movies
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,1,I have learned my lesson not to watch any movie with Nicolas Cage.
" Putting the God in God Awful
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,1,"Everyone involved in this movie should maybe change career paths because every aspect was just horrible.
For your own sake, don't watch this movie. Save your time, money, and sanity"
" Movie started strong then dropped basic plot and turned into action movie
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,4,"I thought when I saw the low ratings on this film it was because people simply do not like movies with Christian themes. However, after watching this I had to give it a 4, as only about the first third was interesting and stuck with the rapture theme. Had it stayed with that theme rather than turning into a Hollywood airplane panic movie. Once it did that very little truly related to the rapture theme and next to nothing addressed how people could still be saved after the rapture.Highly disappointing. If I could I would give it 3 1/2 stars."
" Don't get the mass negativity
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,5,"Am I Cage's biggest fan? No! But to say he was completely awful in this film is unfair. The same applies to Michael-Murray.I found it an interesting take on the rapture and it encouraged me to do some research into the subject. The film kept me interested right until the end.Worth watching, don't let the low rating stop you from giving it a go."
" Don't waste your time
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,1,"Oh dear me!!! This is quite honestly the worst film I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through, it is truly awful.
Storyline is ridiculous, acting is dreadful and directing is just appalling. Never have I watched a film with sooooo many bad actors in it"
" Bad idea for an apocalypse movie
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,1,"The film is about the rapture in which most of humanity vanished to be spared by God from the apocalyptic world that is to emerge leaving a pilot, a travel writer, and his daughter to uncover and survive the cataclysm. What a ridiculously horrible movie experience themed for such religious beliefs and ideologies. What kind of movie starring Nicholas Cage is put on the big screen?"
" ???
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,1,"Like ... what did Vic Armstrong smoke when directing this movie?
Was this a result of a lost bet?
Was he trying to make a homage to bad 70's movies, in script, props and directing?So confused."
" Don't believe the negative reviews
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,10,CAGE IS BACK.This movie starts slow but builds into an intense thriller. Cage is back to his best and keeps you wanting more. The storyline is is great and keeps the suspense going throughout this film.
" Remake of an evangelical B movie
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,1,"If you really want some class A cringe, either watch the original, or read the insane gibberish by reviewers who gave this nonsense anything higher than a 5 and are serious about the content. There is a small following of people who like this because it is so bad it is funny. But if there is a reason to avoid this forced dumpster fire, it is the apologists for this film. Deluded, often rabid trailer trash nitwits who see communists behind every tree.There was some idiot on here that claimed that calling this movie bad, which it objectively is, means one must have an anti religious agenda!!! Well, seeing as we do not have much religion over here, having an agenda against it is kinda pointless. What I do have is an agenda against flaccid mediocrity and bad writing.The reviews with a 10 score are funny as hell by the way, if you ignore the fact that it is a good indication that our species will not survive this century."
" Not dreadful.
",2020-08-06 00:00:00,5,"Sure it has a 'made for TV' feel about it, I guess due to budgetary constraints, but I can't understand the hate this film seems to attract. Maybe the people reviewing have a problem with Christian beliefs and morals, and if you do, then this isn't a movie for you.I went into it with a just a basic idea of what it was about, and found myself entertained for the duration.Yes, more could have been done with the storyline, and some of the acting was a little hammy, but overall it was decent, in no way a classic, but as a time passer, fine.As someone who isn't a true believer, I didn't find it preachy either."
" Strong movie
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,10,Powerful message about Revelations and what it means within the context of these times we're living in ...
" I don't give 1-star reviews lightly
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,1,"I really wanted to like this movie. As an open minded Christian I thought it would be interesting to see how people envision their belief in the rapture. But this movie would be better off on Pureflix or something. It's pure prosthelytizing. They had a bunch of stereotypical ""sinners"" and non-believers. The philanderer, the gambler, the drug user, the person who puts money above all, the Muslim, etc. These are very one-dimensional characters and it showed. The acting was atrocious and the conversations did not seem natural but simply scripted prosthelytizing. There were many plot holes and ill-conceived concepts that despite trying to like this movie I couldn't. If I didn't watch it for ""free"" on prime I would ask for my money back like others. Wasted two hours of my life.On a side note I doubt even more now that the rapture is scruptural according to this envisioning of it. It makes it seem like God doesn't care about the world or its inhabitants. When they showed a dog on a chain with its owner gone I am like, no loving god would leave that poor dog to likely starve to death..."
" Horrible
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,2,The original was 500 times better! Why not continue the series in stead of redoing what was great in the first place. 👎👎
" The film did not touch reality
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,1,"The film did not touch reality.
The hero is five stars but the movie does not these trivialities .. the end is very, very bad"
" Definitely the best movie I saw during these last 1h 50 min !
",2020-07-22 00:00:00,2,"Almost everything in this movie is terrible.
Except the very end of it.
Therefor, It gets an extra rating-point from me"
" Oh it's bad. It's so bad.
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,1,"The premise is good. As a religious film it starts off quite mysterious. Then the 'rapture' happens and it all goes a bit cheesy.It would have been easier to have hired a choir to sing out the story line.It's quite an offensive movie if you follow any faith other than Christianity/Catholicism. If you're an atheist, it's just a really bad film."
" No. Just no!!
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,1,"Promising start. So disappointing from then on.
Go do some washing, scrub the kitchen, have a nap!!
DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!"
" Left Behind
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,1,"Now, I'm not a fan of Nicolas Cage's tendency to overact however I do like a good post-apocalyptic thriller that, when executed well never fail to engage me from start to finish. Even a biblical thriller has potential, albeit limited, to be engaging. However, when watching Left Behind I was left with the overarching feeling that this film is actually really boring.Nicolas Cage's tendency to overact isn't actually evident here, as his character adopts a more sombre tone as a result of realising he hasn't done enough to redeem himself and will spend eternity on what is essentially a living hell. However, Cage comes across as more bored than sombre, which may be down to the fact that this film for a post-apocalyptic thriller is a needless snoozefest that delivers on none of the admittedly limited promise it has. It's also worth looking at the people, ahem, left behind, particularly one character who is left in purgatory simply for adhering to a different religion to his peers. You cannot tell me that Cage's wife who is in the midst of fanatically and dangerously flouting her beliefs is worthy of surviving the rapture either, as her character comes across as inherently unlikeable?I would recommend this film to anyone who also enjoys seeing how bad films can get without becoming a cult classic like The Room or Plan 9. Everything about this film is cringeworthy and embarrassing. Avoid."
" I liked this movie alot
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,9,"I honestly dont understand why everyone hates this movie. I thought it was really good, this is my second time watching it."
" Can I select zero stars?
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,1,"Its about a bizarre disappearance of millions of people.Oh no, wait, it's about Nicolas Cage landing a plane.Meh."
" You will be never get this time back
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,1,"Actually the worst movie I have ever experienced. Do not waste your life on this truly awful film...
The only spoiler.....DONT DO IT"
" Bring out the bias!
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,6,"Nothing like a religious movie to bring out the bias and prejudice of the movie going public! 'Left Behind' certainly does that from a glance at these reviews. The premillennialist Christians think it was wonderful, the atheists think it is rubbish. It certainly is not a 9 or 10, but it is not a 1 or 2 either. Sure, it is preachy, a bit stilted but it does have some effective editing and is is certainly not Nichols Cage's worst movie. There are moments of good acting from the lesser known actors and moments of cheesiness as well. Could I suggest that viewers should shelve their pro or anti Christian bias and sit back and enjoy the movie as it is - an OK movie that simply tells a story."
" Dreadful
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,1,"I am not fond of Cage as an actor and I do not blame him for this film directly, but it's one of the worst films I've ever seen."
" Oh my god!! Worst EVER!
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,1,My poor husband...he was like...please don't watch anything by this actor as it's always thee worst films imaginable! I was so stupid to put it on!! My god! Thee worst movie I've ever seen!! After a terrible introduction to characters and then everyone started disappearing into thin air!! and only their clothes left behind! I mean evaporated!! What! I'm laughing now thinking of it but such a waste of 25 mins of my life! I'm sorry I just can't believe my eyes! Hilariously bad...and ur brain and body screams with agony to turn it off!! Isn't it mad Netflix are pumping out these ridiculous end of life and intergalactic war/alien invasion movies!!! Yes we are not alone!! But Jesus we are so unimaginative!! Poor US pumping out these movies! Anyways! Doesn't Mr Cage have any Morales? And no acting skills for sure! Hear he's doing the Tiger King next! Can't wait!!!
" Make America Christian Again.
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,2,"Nicholas cage keeps this films' head above water with a decent performance to stop this disaster movie turn cataclysmic. With woeful writing and sub par acting from both cast and extras you may as well look to final destination 5 for better visuals and a far more gripping story. You could almost take this film for a parody, if it wasn't for the clear lack of direction and intellect. With all that being said it's good to remind ourselves that even this flop was a moderate success on the money front so we may see a return to small independent films rather than a slew of more marvel movies."
" Seriously the worst film I have ever seen.
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,1,This film was utter drivel. We ended up watching to the end just to laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. The script was just awful. So many bad stereotypes - like the pretty yet ditzy flight attendant With perfect shiny lipstick who was crying in the corner when finding out her man was married. Puleeeze. Any real flight attendant would have been badass in that situation and would have had full control of her passengers. Oh and not to mention the obligatory Muslim thrown in for good measure. Shocking stereotypes! Don't waste a minute of your day watching this film. One small saving grace was Jordan Sparks was quite good despite a shocking script!
" Terrible film
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,1,"I think this has to be the worst movie i have seen and almost reason to cancel netflix! Nic Cage has made so many flops that his best (The Rock, Conair, Face Off, National Treasure) are a distant memory away now. Let's hope the new Tiger King is better otherwise he needs a new agent!"
" A terrifying movie !
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,1,"Is it scary because of tension? Is it alarming? Are there as many jumps as Jaws?No, it's obviously terrifying because some people out there believe in this stuff.."
" Embarrassing
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,1,"I'm genuinely embarrassed for everyone involved in this film. Truly, truly terrible. Go watch paint dry, cut your toenails or try and gouge your own eyes out, anything would be preferably to watching this abomination."
" Leave behind the movie and go read the 10/10 reviews
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,1,Trash movie...but reading the 10/10 reviews will be worth the time over the runtime of this flick. Don't waste your time on this movie.
" Junk
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,1,"I'm not blaming the actors, or even the director for this giant piece of garbage or even the fact it was ever made. But I do however blame Netflix for uploading this giant piece of s#@% are you taking the p!$$ !."
" Very Good!
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,9,Good film and I don't understand why so many bad comments! I enjoy watch it! No bad acting at all! The storyline was good! They could do a nice series from this film! I would like where all this people gone! But sometimes a good series stop and they always leave us hanging and I don't understand why! But I recommend people watch it as there is a lot messages those give to this film 1 or 3 they don't really understand sometimes the messages some films can give you!
" New defintion of bad filmmaking
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,1,Do not waste your time. Mr Cage should personally say sorry to all the viweres.
" Social distance from this one
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,1,Poor acting combined with pathetic special effects. Plot also failed. Nick - catch yourself on.
" Terrible
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,1,"Michael Chad Murray probably thought he was onto a winner when he bagged a part in a Nicholas Cage movie. Sadly for him Nicholas Cage is on his way down which is a shame because he has been in some really entertaining movies. The acting was terrible, the plot is even worse. Basically the message is if you don't believe in god he will not save you.Most of the movie is set on a plane and they throw in the usual Muslim passenger just so the rest of the passengers can accuse him of whatever.Really poor movie"
" Entertaining apocalyptic story
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,8,"It's the story of the rapture from the New Testament. Now I'm not religious but I have read parts of the Bible. There are some good stories in there and this is one of them.When I started watching this, I expected it to preach to me, but that never happened.In the end, the moral for me was ""don't lie.""I don't know why so many people didn't like it. Reading all the one star reviews was like watching a mob attacking a victim. I was thinking: are you forming your own opinion or just following the herd?"
" BAD. BORING. AWFUL!!
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,2,"I put this film on to watch one afternoon on Netflix because I was bored and I never knew what to watch. It looks interesting when you read the description but around 10-20 minutes in, I got more bored and watched something else.THE MOST BORING FILM I HAVE EVER WATCHED. What message is it meant to give? To believe in god, heaven or hell?Worst Nicholas Cage movie. Because it was with Nicholas Cages, I thought it was going to be good, but it wasn't.I'm an atheist by the way."
" The dumbest film ever made. Ever.
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,1,"Ensuring Nick Cage will never be taken seriously again, this one is for Trump voters only."
" Absolutely appalling
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,1,"You don't know at the start of this movie but it is a vehicle for proselytising. It's an advert for god, but it's an advert that doesn't try to sell you on believing in god, it's and advert that basically threatens that if you refuse to believe in god, you will suffer misery and death.
Yeah such is the long argument about a so called christian god, you either love him, or you suffer the unimaginably horrible and cruel consequences.
I often equate god with a brutal and savage leader of a drug cartel. Because his wrath throughout recorded history has been sever and brutal and devastating, unless you give him 100% of your life.
It's an evil message, from an evil faith, and films like this should be banned as they are threatening and scare mongering.
Shame on the actors who put their name to this. Apart from Nicolas Cage, cos he puts his name to anything that will take him. Because he knows that is his only option as he is almost unbearable onscreen."
" Had to sign up to give this movie 1*

" This movie was a hatchet job on All Professed Christians alike - Very Mild Spoilers
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,1,"This like many ""Faith Based Movies"" are made by people who are very likely not professed Christians themselves. It Makes GOD look bad in almost every way. Here God is chaotic in the way he does things and impossible to understand. The question is asked - ""Why God lets so many bad things happen"" and the ""Christian"" stands there dumbfounded. The fact that she is Dumbfounded may actually be typical of many ""Christians"" today. But the simple answer would have been that Satan promised Eve to ""Be like God knowing good and Bad"" Eve decided she wanted independence and Adam followed her. God is proving now that independence has been a disaster for mankind. If God ran around putting out all the fires behind the scenes that mankind is setting then he would be helping mankind prove that they can be independent. Also He promises in his own time to completely undo the damage that has been done all these years. Only he knows how that can be done. 1John 3:8 and Heb 2:14 <and many others. Believe it or not a little old lady who knocked on my door told me this simple but clear explanation one day.
The movie in no way answered any of the many questions raised in the minds of the people watching about Gods fairness for what he does. They all sit there until the end of the movie and end does little to redeem God. Watch out for these movies masquerading as ""Christian movies"". Many are likely written by Atheists.PS: A little something about the ""Early Springers"" that the movie showcased. What will happen if the ""Rapture"" Does not happen on Que as is in this movie? Could you imagine the disillusionment? The Bible does not say exactly when God will call those that are really his. In fact is says that the Tribulation is cut short on account of the Elect/Chosen -Matt 24:22 and Satan even wages war with them -Re 12:17-13:8. The idea that true Christians will completely avoid the Tribulation is pure wishful thinking.Pet"
" Not that bad!!!
",2020-03-11 00:00:00,6,"When i started watching this movie, i was expecting a total plane crash of a movie, i mean all these bad reviews.
What i got was a B movie that was rather enjoyable and nowhere near as bad as 1 out of 10.
Ok this won't win any oscars and the acting wasn't that great but to say this is the worst movie ever goes way to far.
This movie unfortunately doesn't do any favors for Nicholas Cage but he is only in it for a decent paycheck and his performance was ok i suppose but he is a B movie actor now so these are the kind of movies he will be in.
The story is quite simply written and nothing that special but its kinda interesting but they should have spent a little more time on the important scene in the beginning of the film, because that could have been pretty cool,but it must have been more then they wanted to spend on it so the most important scene in the movie is mere seconds long.
Beside all of these things i didnt feel like i was watching the worst movie ever but i was rather entertained for 90 minutes.
6 out of 10 for me, only because i didnt feel bored watching it"
" This is nice and interesting film
",2020-03-11 00:00:00,9,"I do not understand why so many people hate this film so much. Afte 6 years, i still like it. General idea and plot is very nice and i do not see serious reasons to give negative evaluation for performance as well."
" I should have read the reviews before
",2020-03-11 00:00:00,2,"Film about suddenly disappearing people. Terrible plot, horrible acting even Cage couldn't lift that. Weird movie ,,,, all the time I was waiting for it to actually start and then it was finished ."
" Not Bad as the Reviews
",2020-03-09 00:00:00,10,"I thought that the Movie was quite good. I think that those people who are giving bad reviews are just spoiled brats who just say something for the sake of it. They probably saw the other Left Behind sequels and compare it, and obviously wanted as Supermovie just because Nicholas Cage is in it.
Also many people compare a movie with the book that they read and that is NOT HOW to compare it. Just imagine that for a book everybody have a DIFFERENT IMAGINATION of how it would look like in reality and when they see that the book does not match with THEIR PERSONAL IMAGINATION then they think that it's not a good movie.I gave 10/10 stars just to counter balance the bad reviews even though I think that it actually deserves 7/10.My work allows me to watch a lot of TV shows and movies and trust me that I have watched a lot of bad acting and bad storylines but this one is not one of them.If you watched the other Left Behind, then this one will be similar but if not, then I bet that you will enjoy it."
" Slightly more amusing than most religious movies, but still terrible
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,1,"In my quest to watch as many bad movies as possible, I soon came to the conclusion that Christian cinema is the worst type of movie. I'm not trying to offend anyone, but that's just my opinion. The reason: it's really boring. This one is slightly better than such irredeemable dreck as Saving Christmas or God's Not Dead, due to the unintentional comedy provided by Nicholas Cage and the short angry man; but it's definitely not something worth watching, unless you're really bored."
" Cage Left a lot Behind
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,4,The story is here on this one. The execution is a little off by the way it was presented. I am not sure to blame the actors or the script. From what I hear the book was solid.
" Strange
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,2,"After millions of people across the world are disappearing without a trace, the remaining survivors must try to work out what has happened to their friends and family as the world descends into chaos. Worse still, the plane that they are on is leaking fuel following a collision with another aircraft and with several nearby airports closed pilot Raymond Steele (Nicolas Cage) must try to find a way to land the plane as safely as possible...Left Behind gets off to a fairly corny start; particularly in the way that Ray's daughter and the journalist meet and begin chatting. However, I could accept this in the hope that things would pick up and become more exciting when the film is in 'full flight' - apologies for the pun. Sadly though this simply doesn't happen..OK so once we're on-board the aircraft we get introduced to a wide variety of characters all of whom have different personalities and backgrounds - it seemed to be a case of covering all bases here. Once we get to know them, some of the passengers vanish without a trace leaving the audience and the remaining survivors trying to figure out what has happened to their loved ones. The trouble is that the wishy-washy script skirts around the issue for around 45 minutes with most of the time being spent with the passengers arguing and coming up with increasing ludicrous suggestions as to what has happened to the remaining passengers. Perhaps this approach was employed to make things more tense or to give the film a sense of mystery, but it isn't pulled off particularly effectively here meaning that large chunks of the film are tedious.Even when the film does start to try to make sense of what's happening it doesn't do so in an entirely convincing way; I understand that the good people are taken to heaven and those that have sinned are left back on earth - presumably the pain and suffering of having to live without a loved one is penance for their sins. This aspect of the narrative would have perhaps been more involving if we'd have learned more about the characters - particularly the ones on the plane. If we'd have learned some of the good things that the good people had done and the bad things that the sinners had done then I might have been able to buy into it more. However, just having people disappearing at random with no real explanation till towards the end of the film makes a lot of the film feel redundant and silly. Speaking of random and silly, look at Ray allowing Buck into the cockpit area (even before all hell breaks loose). I can't imagine any pilot doing that certainly in the post 9/11 era.There's no doubt about it Left Behind is a strange film and is definitely something of an acquired taste (although looking at its IMDB rating I'm not quite whose taste it is supposed to be acquired to). You get the feeling that the intention here was to produce an action film with something to say. The end result however is a film that is too dull to fall into the category of action and too muddled to be make its point in a coherent manner."
" This movie has an unexpected philosophy
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,7,"I knew this movie had terrible ratings and reviews. So I knew there was a pretty good chance it would be horrible. But I wanted to watch it anyway because it has 2 things I enjoy - (1) landing a plane under perilous circumstances and (2) the consequences of people suddenly vanishing off the face of the earth.I'll address the first point quickly and spend more time on the second in this review. As a movie about landing a plane when you're out of fuel and the closest airport has no open runway, it did a good of job to keep me invested. It's not the best in its genre, but worked for me.Now on to the ""Rapture"". Full disclosure: I am not Christian. But I remember the time when a Christian floormate in college told me the story of the Rapture and it gave me chills. And I've been fascinated with the concept. This led me to check out the show The Leftovers. And then there's of course Avengers Infinity War and Endgame. Each of these three properties take a very different approach to what it means for the population of the world disappearing, but I won't focus on that here.But first, another disclosure: I haven't read the series of novels on which this is based, or the other series of movies based on those novels. However, from what I can gather, all of these follow the Rapture pretty closely. So, I'm guessing only ""the true believers"" get zapped into Heaven.But is that what really happens in this particular movie though? It leaves it kind of wishy washy in my opinion. In the family of the central characters, only the mother and the brother are Raptured because she was a true believer in Christ and the son was a child. The father and the daughter clearly did not believe in either religion or in Christ, which is probably why they didn't get Raptured. But neither of them explicitly state that they are atheists. It is implied that they are, more strongly for the daughter (and the journalist) than the father.Anyway, I noticed that they showed us many couples of whom only one member was Raptured and the other wasn't. Do we conclude that one person was a true believer and the other wasn't? It seems unlikely that you would have that many couples where there is such a huge discrepancy in faith. This led me to think maybe the person who didn't get Raptured has Sinned in some way and had not repented. After all, the sins of most of the people on the plane were quite clear (the guy who gambled, the guy who was very close to cheating on his wife, the drug addict, etc.)Interestingly there was a Muslim guy on the plane. I was curious - did he not get Raptured because he was not Christian / didn't have the ""right"" beliefs about Christ, or was it because he had Sinned? I did notice that he was checking out the blonde woman in a creepy way, so maybe he was a bad guy?But there are no answers to this question in this movie at least. I'm guessing the book series goes into detail about this. But I was also curious about how the Rapture was determined for children. Where was the cutoff? Was it a certain age and if so, how was the calculation of the age done? But I digress.I bring all of these up to address the philosophy of the movie.I went into this prepared for a very preachy Christian movie about the consequences of not Believing in ""The Truth"". That is why it surprised me when (1) there were no concrete answers to the points I raised above, and (2) the non-believing characters actually made well articulated and compelling points about why they don't Believe. In fact throughout the whole movie, we sympathize with these characters who were ""left behind"" and I felt like I could totally relate to their point of view. And while some of them were shown to have vices, some of them were also shown to be good people. (For example, the journalist goes out of his way to help everybody, and that Muslim guy was also shown to offer help to people around him despite some creepy vibes.) As far as the central characters go, the movie doesn't seem to blame these characters for not Believing or even paint them in a negative light.The point the characters make over an over again is - why would a loving God do these things? They talked about natural disasters and how people suffer and die due to them and how God does nothing to help. The ""God works in mysterious ways"" arguments is brought up but dismissed. And when the Rapture happens, the world goes into chaos, it seems so hard to believe that a loving God would do this.So what is the philosophy of the movie? That maybe God ISN'T loving. Maybe God is punitive and will punish all of us. The movie seems to raise the question, so what do you do if you discover that God is vengeful and punitive? And that kind of blew my mind. I fully expected that this movie would go to extreme lengths to justify God's actions, but it really doesn't. (Yes, sure, it does say that the people who were Raptured were taken to Heaven to be protected, but God was being PRETTY DARN exclusive and petty in who was Saved vs. who wasn't.)I don't know what direction the potential sequels would have gone, but to me it felt like they were going for a post-apocalyptic movie where the survivors of the Rapture would have to deal with the consequences of having displeased a vengeful God. And I don't think they would overcome this God by the end of it - by the end of it, they would have to give in and submit to this God. And that's kind of depressing.Another disclosure: I'm not atheist. I believe in God kinda sorta in my own unique way that doesn't strictly follow any scripture. But I do subscribe to the idea of a loving God and definitely not to one of a vengeful and petty God. And I also am not arrogant in my beliefs such that I think I am right and everyone else is wrong. So that could be why I had this take on the philosophy of this movie - that it raises the question - what if the Rapture is real even though it doesn't make any sense according to your beliefs? And that's a very interesting take, in my opinion."
" ONLY ""GOD"" KNOWS WHY CAGE AGREED TO MAKE THIS?

" Left Behind summons Satan himself to relinquish the souls of those who decide to watch this piece of religious propaganda.
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,1,"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I've committed many immoral acts of evil during my time on this bountiful land you have *apparently* created for us. Supporting atheism. Embracing homosexuality. Becoming a pathological liar. Hell, excuse my blasphemy, I've even stolen a deck of 'Yu-Gi-Oh' cards when I was a child. Not proud of that one! Suffice to say, my soul is as ""Dirrty"" as Christina Aguilera. But my biggest sin is one I've committed recently. In fact, to be specific, last night. I bravely watched Left Behind. A piece of Christian propaganda where the world experiences a biblical rapture and everyone is running around losing their ""God damn honey!"". And, without coming across as insensitive, oh my God it's worse than attending Sunday Service!Sensationalist propaganda that ham-fists Christian revelatory views upon its audience with atrocious acting, inexcusable writing and misplaced direction. Cage is a pilot. ""See my badge?"". And he doesn't care. Because when the screenplay insists on having a couple of delusional characters preach Christian teachings at every possible opportunity, that's what God wanted apparently, I don't blame him. This rapturous apocalypse drives everyone crazy. Civilians purposefully stealing things to highlight how sinful they are. Even driving our protagonist to attempt suicide. The world is manic, and it's ""God's"" fault. But it's fine. Honestly! Armstrong depicts our beloved deity as a beacon of generosity. What he/she/it/I don't care has bestowed upon this persecuted land is a blessing. Because, y'know, we weren't Cher and we didn't ""Believe"" (auto-tune included...), so why do we deserve to be saved?Urgh, this got too deep for a review. Keeping it short and sweet, it's one of the worst films I've endured. All it took was the rapture to reunite a father and daughter, before tackling an apocalyptic world to which is ""only just the beginning"". So start believing in God, or else we're getting a sequel..."
" Not a disaster movie, but a movie disaster.

" This is the only review I've ever written because it's so bad
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,1,"I started watching this movie with my boyfriend because we genuinely like Nick Cage and National Treasure is a favorite of ours. The trailer seemed decent so decided not to look it up online beforehand. Oh dear god, pun intended, this Christian flop was such a disaster. Halfway through we became aware it was a Jesus movie, but even despite that it's just god awful. I don't know why Cage is in this?? Or who wrote the script so badly for this but it was honestly just painful to watch."
" I should have left this behind
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,3,"I only paid 25p (about a quarter in the states) in a charity shop for this DVD and to be honest, I don't think it was worth it.
While the acting was good and the background story wasn't to bad, this film let itself down by not giving any explanation as to what had happened.
There were a few ""suggestions"" trying to give an idea of what happened but it was basically blamed on god. it would have been a lot better if someone somewhere had discovered a wormhole or an alien race to blame or even like in ""The Happening"" blame it on mother nature.
Now for the ending of the film, WOW so many things to pick holes in there I'm not even going to bother listing them all, suffice to say there are way to many coincidences and near misses that it was almost comedic.
Overall just about worth a watch if your trying to kill a couple of hours. (90 mins to watch the film and 30 mins to give it a bad review on here)"
" A disaster movie with a biblical twist
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,4,"This disaster movie sees pilot Rayford Steele flying from New York to London on his birthday. He claims that he was called in at the last minute but it is soon clear that he wanted to be away from home. His marriage has been failing since his wife started to believe that every natural disaster was a sign that the end of the world was nigh. At the airport, before the flight, he meets his daughter. Here she also meets and befriends reporter Buck Williams who is on the London flight. As the plane loads we are introduced to various characters, mostly those in first class. As the plane flies over the Atlantic something strange happens... a number of passengers just vanish leaving a pile of clothes where there were seated. Nobody on board realises at the time but millions of people around the world have also vanished. As Rayford turns his plane around and starts to head back to New York he starts to wonder if perhaps his wife wasn't as mad as he thought.When I picked up this film on DVD all I knew was that it starred Nicolas Cage; judging by the box art it featured a plane crashing onto a river (it doesn't); and most importantly it cost twenty five pence. Having watched it I'd say it was just about worth the 25p! The story is typical disaster movie in the way it opens; we are introduced to key characters and then something happens that puts them in danger. The way several people just disappear was intriguing although the ultimate explanation was heavily sign posted. The conclusion is quite exciting but also quite ridiculous. I don't mind stories inspired by biblical prophecy... after all 'The Omen' is great. This isn't though. The characters aren't that interesting; apart from Nicolas Cage's pilot and an angry dwarf I didn't find them interesting enough to care about... they were just a collection of clichés and stereotypes. The film also has a highly dubious religious message... if you believe you'll go to heaven even if you are intolerant of others but if you don't or are of the wrong faith you are doomed. The production values are pretty good at least. Overall I don't think this film is as bad as some of the reviews suggest but it is hardly a must see unless you are a Nicolas Cage fan and want to see all of his films or connoisseurs of laughable movies."
" Wow.
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,1,"SPOILERS!!!!This film, wow. It's stunning. The acting, the script, the plot, the constantly changing plane. It's a heart wrenching classic.In summery Thanos has managed to get all the infinity stones and people have started to disappear. Mainly the children as they're the smallest so take the least time to turn to dust. The Avengers are nowhere to be seen so Nick Cage takes it upon himself to save the day as Captain Ray Steele.It's hard to pick a favourite part of the movie, but I think mine would be the part where Nick was running out of fuel after having a mid air crash with another plane, and he had nowhere to land, terrifying. It's so lucky that his daughter (just in college) is like Evel Knievel on a motorcycle! She managed to find a truck and clear the road so he has somewhere to land. And she knew how to drive the tarmac roller thingy. AND then started an explosion so Nick would know to land the plane!I did feel for the passengers on that landing though, it must have been like a Ryan Air flight.I give it 1 out of 10 stars, but 10 Nick Cage's out of 10."
" God Help Cage
",2019-11-20 00:00:00,1,"This film's concept of the apocalypse involves people's clothes being left while the people themselves disappear. If that sounds original to you, then you clearly have never seen Vanishing on 7th Street. That movie leaves a lot of questions unanswered, but at the very least remains chilling and original - sort of like a sheet with numbers and disaster predictions. That plot element is the only thing original about Knowing, but the only originality this movie didn't leave behind was a question of how a short man drives a car. That joke is a diamond the size of a pumpkin seed. And a seed in the Grand Canyon at that. The worst part is that two thirds of the canyon are full of skunk excrement, instead of any story or pace whatsoever!!!That's how Left Behind must be looked at if the good lord will allow you into heaven."

" Missed the Point...
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,2,"IMHO, the point of these books and by default this movie is to draw people to the truth of Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior. This movie totally missed the point and gave us a miss mash of Mission Impossible/Speed.
From the opening credits, the missed the mark by changing the city from Chicago to New York. They changed smart characters into bumbling conspiracy theorist, the changes the timing of the event in North America, and made Chloe into this combination of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. Nicholas Cage was just 2 steps removed from his role in Con Air and they just let people walk in and out of the cockpit like they were at home.If I did not know the power behind the books and the ultimate message, this movie would NOT inspire me to investigate more. Thank God, Tim LaHaye and Jerry B Jenkins finished the books before these hacks got a hold of the idea."

But how wrong I was....... this movie is officially, the.worst.movie.I've.ever.seen. Nick cage is a pilot with a bad sense of humor who's having an affair, that's all you'll know about him by the end of the movie. There's also nick cage's daughter, who's.........nick cage's daughter. Yeah, that's pretty much her only personality trait. And there's nick cage's wife, who's, you guessed it: nick cage's wife. Oh and a good christian. So this movie is about the rapture, but my god do they drag it out before the rapture finally happens. So after like.. way too long, the rapture FINALLY happens. So nick cage's daughter is in a mall when it happens with her kid brother, who gets raptured. Now people have disappeared, their clothes and personal property are lying on the ground. But people are still robbing each other!?!?!? JUST PICK UP WHAT'S ON THE GROUND!!! Anyways, nick cage is in the air with his passenger plane and what do you know...his plane happens to be on an EXACT collision course with some other plane....can you believe it!? Because I certainly can't. So nick cage has all kinds of plane problems to deal with, but meanwhile, passengers have disappeared!!!??? Oh no, what is happening!?!? Why are all the characters clueless about the rapture because for the audience it was evident that the rapture was going to happen from the first minute. So why are they treating it as of the audience doesn't know what's going on either, by dragging out the plot so long before letting the characters find out what's happening. Also, at this point nothing happens in the movie. It's just nick cage's daughter trying to get home, just.walking between chaos. She doesn't encounter anyone interesting, doesn't do anything interesting...... so back to nick cage. He's......still in a plane...trying to figure out what's happening. There's this journalist guy on the plane who's trying to comfort people and explain things......so there some screentime that's filled with that.....and than nick cage's daughter arrives home and finds out that her mother has been raptured, wow. What a shocker. So nick cage gets some more plane problems and finds out that the rapture is happening.......FINALLY. He has to make an emergency landing and everyone survives woohoo. So he meets up with his daughter and they look at the city burning in the distance. Nick cage's daughter than says: ""It's only the beginning."" NO IT'S NOT. IT IS THE ENDING, THANK GOD!

" Wasted 2 hours of my life watching this.
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,1,"I like Nicolas Cage, he's starred in some really great movies - Face/Off, Drive Angry, The Rock, Mandy, Bringing Out The Dead, Con Air and Leaving Las Vegas so curiosity got the better of me and i watched this.
Nic Cage is the only actor you will recognise in the movie and every scene he's in he looks like he would rather be anywhere else. He's thinking about what he's having for dinner that night or that suit he has to pick up from the dry cleaners on the way home. He has a look in his eyes like he's waiting for the Cohen Brothers or Scorsese to come and rescue him and his career.
The movie is nearly 2 hours long and you will feel it, they are a long 2 hours. Everyone acts poorly and looks confused, the special effects are on the same level as a cheap TV movie from the 90's, the story is absurd, the characters do the dumbest things and the religious overtones are so childishly bias that i imagine even Christians who usually enjoy this crap would be offended.

",2019-09-10 00:00:00,1,"Acting was really really really bad, the movie was terrible in all ways. The original Left Behind is actually a really good movie, and movie series. This remake is horrible. Watch the original one and you can see how much better the old one is."
" Stupid self-indulgent nonsense
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,1,"I enjoy a Bible-based disaster movie if it has a good story and good acting (e.g. something like End of Days, with Arnold Schwartzenegger).However, what this movie has 'left behind' is any semblance of concern for acting, plot, realism, subtlety, or even decent special effects. It is an execrable film with no redeeming features whatsoever, and probably signals the end of Nicholas Cage's career.Added to that is its smug insistence that 'bad' people (read non-Christians, scientists, free thinkers, rationalists etc) will all be left to suffer eternal torture, while believers are magically whisked away to paradise. This reveals its origins in a virulent strain of American fundamentalist Christianity.I don't seem to be able to give it less than 1 star, and that is much more than it deserves."
" Excuse me Ma'am, do you have a minute to talk about Jesus Christ?
",2019-09-07 00:00:00,4,"It's extremely difficult to miss the religious propoganda in this movie, it's eye rolling dumb and cringe worthy. I was curious who the top raters were of this movie and my suspicions were confirmed, finding mostly religious nuts who believe in the rapture gave me more entertainment as I read through their warnings of doom.The reason I gave this a four star? I like Nicholas Cage and I like apocalyptic movies."
" Crazy Christians
",2019-09-06 00:00:00,1,Why in the short 20 or so minutes I had this film on was every Christian treated like a nut job or something they where ashamed of being. This is suppose to be a Christian movie and no one in it seemed to want to be one or if they where one the movie and the other characters would treat them as if they are loony. What kind of Christian movie is that?
" After thanos snapped finger
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,8,I imagined this movie was what happened after thanos snapped his finger and half the population disappeared. Then showing us a realistic viewpoint from religious nuts that think it was rapture. That way the movie was slightly better and made more sense.
" God-awful
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,1,"Verily, God-awful. Only began watching it because my girlfriend really wanted to watch it. And when Cage's character says at around 1hr 15mins in, ""Heaven"", my girlfriend immediately said, ""Alright, that's it turn it off!"" I couldn't have been more relieved, as it was abysmally bad right from the beginning. Praise the lord!"
" Horrible
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,1,"Just wasted my precious time.
It was better to rewatch Harry Potter even I watched 100 times.
So boring, useless, meaningless movie."
" Nicolas Case, i don't trust you anymore
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,1,"Nicolas Case, i don't trust you anymore. What a terrible movie. It is a shame that you have contributed to this movie. From now on i first have to read the reviews before i'm going to watch one of your movies.PS. Netflix, please delete it!"
" Awful
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,1,Worst movie I have watched. Extremely slow and difficult to follow when there's no clear story line. Poor acting and would not recommend watching this movie.
" Obvious...
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,7,"After the first 10 minutes after the incident, it was obvious to me this was the cause of Thanos. 🤣🤣"
" Awful
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,1,"I even tried to let it work past the ""rapture"" I just gets worse every secondAnyone downvoting this review is doing so purely to protect their religious views."
" Absolutely awful. Should not exist.
",2019-07-17 00:00:00,1,Its a shameless remake of a good movie. I love the left behind books and i love the original three movies. This honestly looks like it was made just to be another Nicholas cage saves alot of people on a doomed airplane movie just with the addition of the rapture. The movie didn't establish the characters. It has nothing to do with the original books aside for the rapture happening and the character names. I do not recommend this film to anyone especially if they are a fan of the books and original three movies with Kirk Cameron.
" Won't save the world but refreshingly different
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,7,"There movie was not great but there was nothing major wrong with it.At first watch it nailed me to the screen, despite the fairly low budget and the rather lukewarm acting, it was a movie worth watching 'til the end.I wont restart anybody's career but its a good choice to see something instead of repeating another blockbuster."
" Complete garbage

" Good for anyone that wants to waste an hour and 50 minutes
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,1,"A complete waste of time. This movie is the dictionary definition of a dumpster fire, and has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. Can't believe I wasted my evening watching it Christmas Day."
" This movie is awful
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,1,This movie is not even close to the book I am sorry to say. The entire movie is based on the beginning of the book Left Behind and left out everything that happens after including the Lord and the Bible. This movie was made by people who aren't Christian and it shows.
" One of the Better Christian Movies Out There!
",2019-07-11 00:00:00,8,"Sad to say I waited 5 years to watch this movie. I read the abysmal reviews and never took the time to watch it for myself. Honestly, I will agree there is some bad script writing and bad acting contained within, however the main cast did great. Nic Cage did great. The movie was enjoyable and action packed. My kids watched the movie and loved it, and when it ended they wanted more. It also fueled a conversation about eschatology in general, and the rapture in particular. Well worth a watch, and I wish I had supported it long ago. I'm not surprised that the general public received it so negatively, but it at least deserved the support of Christian moviegoers. I wasn't disappointed, once I gave it a chance. I recommend you watch it for yourself."
" this is more of a question than a review
",2019-07-02 00:00:00,5,"And i really hope this goes trough, cuz Ive been looking for a answer on this:WHY do writers insist on writing dialogue for women, whenever something unexplainable happens, female characters always start focusing on their relationship with one of the male characters.people vanish from inside a plane, mid-air.....and somehow the female flight attendant insist on bringing up the personal relationship with the pilot.this happens in alot of movies....writers seriously needs to up their game, cuz this is extremely bad dialogue"

" Cage Must Be Desperate
",2019-06-22 00:00:00,1,"Terrible Christian propaganda movie, typical bible bashers trying to scare non believers. Terrible acting, boring as he'll script, and bad churches story. Nothing good to review for this movie ..."
" Y'all are scared.
",2019-06-14 00:00:00,7,The bad reviews are coming from anti-religious nuts that have nothing better to do than harp and moan about anything to do with Christianity. The premise of the movie is about The Rapture and those who get left behind after. The Bible clearly states how to not get left behind. The Bible literally stands for Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth. You don't go to heaven simply because you are a good and moral person. Read the Bible and find out for yourself. It's a good read and it may just take some of the hate out of your heart.
" Terrible movie
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,1,"Terrible movie, terrible acting. Boring and drags on."
" Illogical
",2019-05-29 00:00:00,1,"Could not sit through it.The characters' psychological process are not realistic. The movie focus too much on creating breath taking scenes without focusing on creating logic into the movie, makes it quite shallow to watch. At first it gives hint about something related to the Bible, but the movie keeps going on for almost an hour then come back to it. I got super frustrated having to watch it for almost an hour with some bad actings."
" Introspective
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,7,"The movie makes you think about what is now considered ""normal and okay"" a lot. Most of the people giving a one star rating did not understand the movie.
It's perspective on how the worlds end would begin."
" I can't give it -10 stars, so I gave it 1.
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,1,"A badly written and acted movie that tries to shove crazy religious thoughts down your throat.
Things like sattelite phones and other communications not working and planes not having automatic pilot when the pilot disappears are even more unbelievable than people disappearing.The people who are ""left behind"" are more sympathetic than the religious people in this movie. I don't know what the purpose of this movie was, but I wasn't entertained and I hate religion even more now.And I want 1,5 hour of my life back."
" Fantastically horrible.
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,2,"I would give it a 1, but had quite a few good laughs at the dialogue, acting, weird camera angles and shots, and CGI."
" I'm a Christian but this movie was awful!
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,1,"I'm a Christian, so this movie was geared towards people just like me. When I heard there was going to be doing a ""big budget"" movie of the Left Behind book, I was kind of excited. I was a fan of the books when they first came out. Saw the original with Kirk Cameron, and it was only so-so. So I was hoping for a really good movie. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. Ended up turning it off after only 20-30 minutes. The acting was awful. The writing/dialog was awful. It was 100 times worse than the Kirk Cameron version and honestly neither movies do justice to the books. Nicholas Cage's acting is awful, I don't know what happened to him over the years, but his acting has really gone downhill.Recently there have been a number of REALLY well done faith based movies. The production values and acting have begun to be closer to more mainstream movies. But this movie was a stinker."

" Complete lack of respect for their audience
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,2,It takes a lot of nerve to release a movie like this one. The script was horrible and some of the actors appeared to have no formal training.
" Slow burner but not terrible
",2019-04-01 00:00:00,5,I found this film quite refreshing from the big action packed end of the world films our there a nice little slow burner which I enjoyed watch you might be surprised
" Enough to make you an atheist
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,1,"I'm just wondering what the least amount of word i can use to leave a review for this film are. Because watching it was also a complete and utter waste of time. One hardly knows where to begin to even attempt to explain just how bad this film is. Normally you will watch a film to the end just to see what happens i couldn't i gave up with half an hour to go wishing the rapture would make me vanish. Just one thing, what does Christian have against , are they inherently evil. The entire premise for the film is just plain ridiculous, where did they get the inspiration for peddling this nonsense. I understand it's a work of fiction but isnt this also based on what Kirk Cameron believes. What was Nicolas Cage thinking of."
" Two fingers up!!
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,10,"As a massive fan of truly awful movies this has to be right up there with some of my favourites such as Sharknado, Battle of Los Angeles and the Day the Earth Stopped.I've no problem with movie makers trying to shove their ideals down the viewers throats whether it's to do with sexuality, politics or whatever. So, if the Bible Bashers want to do the same I've got no problem with them whatsoever, especially if it results in me rolling on the floor with laughter at their pathetic attempts to do so.Left Behind is a thoroughly entertaining movie for all lovers of Godawful movies."
" At least it was funny...
",2019-03-05 00:00:00,1,"Seriously I don't know how this movie went in to production. The story was so incredibly ridiculous, the acting was HORRIBLE and it was amazing how the pilots daughter just happened to be in front of every major disaster. I couldn't stop laughing at how horrible this movie was. I couldn't stop watching this train wreck of a movie, tears running down my face from laughter. Maybe I'm going to hell... Or maybe I'll be left behind."
" Netflix owes me a free month
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,1,"This movie is nuts. Stupid beyond words and acting so bad that grade school theatre looks like a masterpiece. Plot holes galore, not even going to try and list them as it would be longer than the movie script. Avoid this movie and right-wing nuts who believe this crap"
" Brain meltingly bad
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,1,"I had very low expectations on this movie since i heard its was awful and since Nicholas Cage are a lousy actor. I thought, in my stupidity, that it would one these ""so-bad-its-good-movies""But no it wasn't. It was just brain meltingly bad.In fact it was so bad that I start to fell physically sick and had a severe headache. I thought for real that I was getting sick and I had to lay down to get some rest before writing this review.Where do one start? I use to avoid the grade 1 on imdb because very few movies are so bad that they deserve a number 1. I was thinking of getting this a 2 because a number 1 would be reserved for really, really bad movies. But then I thought: why should I not give this awful piece of trash a 1?It is really that bad. It's in the company of The room, Troll 2 and other ""masterpieces"" but different from these movies this one is mostly boring.Nothing works in this movie. The actors are 100% bad and non believable, the script is horrible, the plot is extremely boring, the Christian ""message"" (if there is any)? Are insanely stupidAll in all this a movie that no one shall see. If there ever is a rapture please take this move but not to film heaven but to the opposite place and let it stay there."
" BEST WAY TO SPREAD THE GOSPLÈ
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,10,"This spiritual work of art is ABSOLUTELY mind boggling in its devotion to Yahweh (Jesús Christ). I showed my 5 children this movie and they were in tears; THEY ARE SIX!!! The only reason this movie did NOT win an Oscar is because of the dirty atheists plagueing this Earth. Man, I wish this would happen to all of the atheists; But I guess they will burn in Heck nonetheless. I watch this movie every single night and I cry EVERY SONGLE TIME. I know this movie like the back of my hand, and, because of this movie, I got through my divorce. This movie, in fact, inspired my divorce; I realized that I could not carry on married to someone who SPORADICALLY goes to church. Watch this movié if you need the compassionate arms of Jehovah (Jesús Christ) wrapped around you once again. <3"
" Will Nic Cage Compensate for Lost Hours of my Life?
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,1,"Not a single pro and a book full of cons. Bad acting, terrible plot, obvious twists thanks to the not so subtle direction. It's a no from me!"
" A bunch of actors that needed the money...
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,1,"I believe that even God wants his money back, this is an awful movie!!."
" This one shouldn't be on the list.
",2019-02-21 00:00:00,7,"I saw ""Left Behind"" because I have a strange hobby...to watch as many of the films as I can from IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list. This list consists of the 100 lowest rated mainstream releases. So, obviously this is for horrible films, and I assumed the movie was horrible. The problem is...it's not a bad movie at all! So why is it on the list? I have three theories. First, it's become very fashionable lately to hate Nicholas Cage. Two of his films (this one and the remake of ""Wicker Man"") are on this list...yet neither is a bad film....but folk love to talk about how rotten an actor he is. He was just fine in ""Left Behind"". Second, the film has a super-narrow appeal...to Evangelical Christians...in particular folks like Baptists, Church of God and other such denominations. Why? Because these churches tend to preach about the end times and the Rapture. Other denominations, such as Methodists, Lutherans and Catholics do not generally hold this doctrine. So, if folks who aren't brought up hearing about the Rapture see the film, they are probably more likely to dislike the plot. Finally, my other thought is perhaps some group of folks have flooded IMDB with scores of 1 (such as how 4chan has attacked a few films en masse). All I know is technically speaking, it's a decent production...not nearly earning the abysmal score of 3.1 it currently has.The story centers on a particular family. The father (Cage) and daughter are not thrilled that the mother (Lea Thompson) has become a Bible-thumping Christian. However, they are shocked when Mom, other believing Christians and all the children instantly vanish....sending the world into total chaos. It's really bad for Cage, as he's piloting an airliner over the Atlantic when all this occurs.Generally, the film kept me interested and was decent. A few things I didn't like were the ending where the plane made an emergency landing....you just have to see it to believe, I mean NOT believe it. Second, I thought the tiny man was a bit overplayed. Who is THAT hostile?? But apart from all that, a decent film....with decent production values and acting."
" Why can I rate this movie 0?
",2019-02-21 00:00:00,1,"The worse ever and I have seen Tommy Wiseau's The Room! This Left Behind is far worse because it wasted some talent not Cage's, but others who could have maybe been somewhere important."
" The first 10 minutes were bareable
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,1,"But apart from that, it's one of the worst I've seen in a long time. Cage has a tradition of starring in both good and and bad movies, this ranks at the bottom of the latter category. There's no point even trying to figure out what they were trying to do. It just goes from one bad cliche to another mixed with things that absolutely don't make sense. I suggest you watch this, just to torture yourself."
" Good idea, very bad movie!
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,3,"Although the idea of the movies is interesting and stating the start of the Apocalypse according to Luke's Bible: ""Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left."" (luke 17:36), but the unprofessional movie script and acting made it unclear, unorganized, and hard to understand."
" A family movie with a doomsday cover
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,2,"A family movie with a doomsday cover. The doomsday disaster is only a foil, except for the film. The air and ground disasters are really pediatric."
" Astonishing CRAP!
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,1,"This must be quite literally the worst film I've ever seen. The plot line has more holes than a colander, the acting is atrocious, the dialogue is embarrassingly amateurish... and that's before you realise what the real agenda is, namely some lunatic religious end-of-the-world 'you should have believed when you had the chance' nonsense. Seriously, do yourself a favour and skip this one."
" Please don't listen to the crap reviews
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,10,"I will admit, the way this movie is done is a little B-Grade - but it is honestly so eye opening. It really got me thinking about the end of days, and there's never been a movie made about this before, the end of days from a Biblical perspective. I found it utterly riveting and it's made me want to be a better Christian. This is so worth watching!"
" Nicolas Cage vs the Rapture
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,6,"I put off watching ""Left Behind"" for a while. I enjoy religious themed movies but for some reason I thought this one going to be too preachy. (It may have to do with an annoying guy at work being a fan of the book.) I'm a fan of most of Nicolas Cage's movies so I finally gave ""Left Behind"" a try. I'm glad I did. It's not grade-A Cage but it is enjoyable. It's fast moving and has a strong cast. I actually want to read the book now. (Please don't tell that guy at work.) Honorable mention: the very dreamy Nicky Whelan."
" Cage's worst film
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,1,"At least its not saving christmas
but that makes this the 2nd or 3rd worst religious film I have ever seen
Cage on a plane is a plus but he doesn't act crazy at all so its no fun."
" Worst movie for me so far
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,1,"Movie was funded Christian missionaries (not religious people) because that detail was suck
A Muslim one in the plane wasn't sent to the heaven ! Since I am not religious people I can look without any bias and If it is real religious film, it should respect other religious as well.
Other than, content was suck, acting was suck
I am not sure why Cage ruined his career with this suck"
" The reviews on this movie are overly critical.
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,6,"While this movie is by far not a blockbuster, or an amazing piece of cinematic history in the making, it is not as bad as the people who are reviewing it say. There are so many much worse movies out there that get better ratings. There is definitely an anti-Christian sentiment going into a lot of the reviews. If it were a non-Christian storyline then it would probably be rated between five and six stars. Like I said it's not an amazing film but it's a fun watch. Give it a chance even if you are any other religion. But if you hate Christianity then this movie is not right for you."
" Christian propaganda
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,1,Quite possibly the worst movie I think I've ever seen absolutely horrible do not waste your time if you start watching it you'll regret it

" Spiritually uplifting!
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,7,"I went into this movie not knowing what to expect but was very pleased with it! From start to finish my interest was held and my beliefs were strengthened! This movie gives you a lot to think about considering your own salvation. Obviously it is hollywoodized but accurate to some extent.
The actors were wonderful with the exception of chad Michael Murray, I have never been a fan of him. Otherwise I think they got an all star cast!
I hope they will follow the original series and complete the trilogy.
This movie may not deserve Best Picture but it is definitely worth your time!"
" why

" Evangelical fanatic movie

",2019-01-18 00:00:00,1,"Since I already expected a religious tone to the movie, I wasn't as taken aback by how totally bland this was...but what is up with Nicholas??? I've seen two movies by him lately, and both are absolute duds...This one takes a look at the book's theme, and that is about all. The rest is frankly non acting by some non descript actors, that makes for a hohum two hours. It's all just so namby pamby...the whole movie is that way, there is no life in it...then there is Cage...I've seen The Sorcerers Apprentice, which was pretty cool; I saw him in Ghost Rider, which wasn't all that memorable but at least had some fun in it; then there was Con Air, that was quite well done but overly blah in parts...Now I've seen two in a row where he has lost any presence as an actor...he is delivering script line with no life in them at all...he's an airline pilot in this movie, and if he was my pilot and I saw him before we took off, I'd miss the flight...OMG, I'm almost all the way through this...and it does not get any better!!! The CGI is terrible, the acting not even mediocre, and the plotholes abound...it is two hours of chaos, literally...If you're still reading, I just downgraded my vote from a 3 to a 1...that is baad!!!"
" Sorry reviews, are those a commentary on the world?
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,3,"As a pseudo-dramatic Science Fiction movie, what I want to add to the dialog is, ""People, this is a complicated idea and it embodies mysticism, paranormal activity or power, beliefs, faith and our human conduct with regards to all those things!"" Come on, seriously? I never read the original books, but my thinking on the subject is clear. I hope the life I lived and the works I have accomplished were 'Good' and helpful to most people for the most part, but helpful and not helpful are relative concepts depending on your perspective. This movie was good to me, I could not have made it, so with everyone being a critic, I think people should consider if they had to produce this story as a film, how would their finished product look? The reviews we write should be honest, yes, but there should be equal measures of kindness included as well. If the starring actor was paid a million dollar salary for 10 days work, maybe this is exactly what that effort was worth! What if they had agreed to a salary like this and due to unforseen complications three weeks were required to complete filming? I think this movie has many merits as a finished product and both my wife and I enjoyed watching it! Actually. Yes. We watched it on a monthly subscription service, free form commercial interruptions and I thought it had many nicely composed, thoughtful scenes with characters simply disappearing for an ""unknown"" reason! It is a nearly complete story and of sufficient length to meet my personal length requirements (i.e. > 88 minutes)."
" What Was That?!
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,2,"I love Nic Cage but was so disappointed in the terrible acting by EVERYONE, the lack of storyline, and complete lack of an ending. What did I just watch? Ugh"
" No movie shall be left behind, except this one. Left alone is more like it.
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,1,"Left Behind is a full-length advertisement directed at believers and non-believers of the events of the rapture according to the Bible. The message is simple, reinforce faith and belief of those who believe, as millions of people are scooped up by God during the Rapture. For those who don't believe, they are left behind to reconcile their future, lack of faith, and loss of loved ones.Those who believe will be treated to a movie that reinforces their belief and will be happy that someone covered the topic with a full-length motion picture. Those who don't believe, are not likely to be moved towards belief, as theistic and atheistic belief systems are far too complicated matter to address in a movie with one agenda, get people to believe by scaring them into believing that they will be left behind.Left Behind is stunningly superficial, as all serious discussion on revealed religions require a responsible handling of meta-physics and epistemology. As it fails to take on these serious discussions, because that is not its purpose, we don't know if it is to be taken seriously or whether it's satire. For this reason, Left Behind can only be said to be intellectually irresponsible and cannot serve as a convincing argument for the Rapture. Finally, Nicolas Cage's performance is almost comical at times, and his conversion to believer, unconvincing.Given the times in which we are living, I would love to see a serious movie on the topic of the Rapture. Perhaps Tom Hanks and Ron Howard might have treated the subject matter with greater respect. Left behind should be left alone."
" Mediocre

I'm a Christian and I know the whole story behind this movie very well (not to mention I even adhere to the real biblical content), but even I thought it sucked. The original version of this movie from 2000 was waaaaay better. That tells you something that over a decade later, they did a remake that was 10x worse. 2 thumbs down. I was even trying to be optimistic while watching it, but was let down over and over. Yikes."
" I Wish the Movie Had Left Me Behind
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,1,"One could've prophesied that I would witness this devilish horror of a movie once it appeared on Netflix. I'm lazy, and this made it too easy. Besides, I tend to enjoy such apocalyptic fiction, and even Nicolas Cage starring in some Evangelical hooey involving planes won't turn me away. I like ""Knowing"" (2009), after all. But, ""Left Behind"" is absolutely dreadful. Every scene is agonizingly contrived and ridden with clichés to push its simplistic religious agenda. There are sinners, and there are saints, and all either any of them do is talk about God. The substandard CGI for the plane stuff is far more realistic compared to just about every conversation in the movie. Additionally, the pacing feels like Purgatory, while the overall experience is like Hell.The doubled irony of ""Left Behind"" is that its cockeyed moralizing is undermined by focusing on the here and now instead of the hereafter and on the ultimate heroism and good naturedness of the irreligious, whereas the faithful, albeit perhaps inadvertently, get people killed and put many more in danger because of their faith. The true miracle here is that for a movie that's all about religious division, it seems to have brought many of varying beliefs together in denouncing ""Left Behind."""
" Don't waste your time!
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,1,"Worst movie ever, really bad acting. It sure why Nicolas Cage is in this movie."
" Umf!
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,1,"Just Umf!yes: Umf!Umf!
Umf!
Umf!. . .and then IMDb deosn't allow me to submit this because:
""Sorry, your review is too short.""imagine that!then here's my response:sorry, this Umf-ful movie is too long!so, deal with it and please let people post short reviews too, ok?
thanks!"
" Good God 😂
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,1,"I'm not sure if the writers deliberately left the Muslim behind, but wasn't very nice.
Terrible movie, but not that bad you have to turn off."
" Not the worst
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,2,"Definitely not the worst movie ever made or for the year either. For those who think that this is worst, should watch more movies. There are many many more that are far worse than this. At least it's got some planes in it."
" Love the books. Horrific move. One of the worst - maybe THE worst
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,1,"It was fun reading the reviews - terrible acting, terrible effects. This was awful & I love the book series. I'm also Christian and know the premise. But as a movie? The worst.Acting: terrible. Often monotone. So calm, unless someone needs to be hysterical; then someone is slightly animated.Effects & the story - millions disappear- yet, traffic flows smoothly. Where are the wrecks? Planes should be crashing everywhere, yet things are neatly broken in an orderly fashion.The end: you'll say ""they would never have (this happen) because it would be far too cheesy."" Yes, that will happen.And the CONSTANT background soundtrack? WHY?"
" Pagans on a Plane?
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,10,"Our hero Nick, plays a philandering airline pilot, with a pious wife and atheist daughter. Nick chooses to fly to London with his new flight attendant girlfriend rather than spend time with his wife and daughter.His flight becomes historic as it occurs during the Rapture. Nick is then tasked with taking a plane, running short of gas and full of only Hillary supporters back to NYC after many of the passengers have disappeared mid flight leaving only their clothes and personal possessions behind. Not all that much to look forward if you are familiar with the Rapture. Its gonna get pretty rough for Nick and his daughter to face the troubles. His wife was among the chosen few."
" Fantastic book series but fails every time in the movies
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,2,"I thought the Kirk Cameron version was bad. This one is pretty bad, too. Religious movies rarely get good backing in Hollywood or good budgets. I recommend reading the books. They are great. I believe in them but I think even non believers can appreciate the story telling."
" This was not at all good; but nowhere near as bad as has been made out.
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,4,"I'm a former Christian and now a vocal atheist. I read the reviews for this movie and out of sheer stubborn curiosity I had to see what a disaster Nic Cage had gotten involved in.Truthfully, I think many other atheists have been a little unfair. Yes, this film wears its 'holier than thou' on it's sleeve, yes the story is pants and yes, definitely among Mr. Cage's worst efforts ever.But...The acting is, well, okay. The cinematography and direction is also okay and the music choices, while certainly awful in two places (both Christian songs,) were nowhere near as bad as has been made out and even, occasionally, appropriate for many scenes. (A sinister yet choral piece during the actual rapture and tense, dramatic music for the finale being decent examples.)Which just leaves the writing. Well, when all is said and done, its based on a book series that was designed to preach to the choir and the film was only ever really going to see mass numbers in the Christian community, so non-Christians, agnostics and Atheists could not help but feel preached to.That being said, the film opens with an evangelist being quite effectively 'shut-down' by a non-believer right from the start and, apart from dad 'hinting' at mom's new-found craziness and the daughter almost getting preached at by said mom, there's nary a mention of religion until about 3/4 of the way through and, even then, no-one yells 'you have to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Saviour to reach the Kingdom of Heaven!' at any point. Oh, there's one almost guilty pleasure at the sight of a Christian Pastor who was not saved and I couldn't help thinking that, in reality, there's going to be hell of a lot of supposed Christians with eggs on their faces if the Rapture was really going to happen as their 'lip-service' Christianity is rewarded like this guy.Truthfully, apart from the insulting way that the writers and director insinuate that those who have not been saved by God are almost all morally deficient in one way or another - rioters, armed robbers, bag snatchers, violent angry bystanders, philanderers, Muslims (not my take, theirs), capitalists, conspiracy nuts etc - the story is just a plain old interpretation, with a sprinkling of family drama and action, of 2000 year old Biblical hog-wash. The way it was interpreted, acted, filmed etc was nowhere near great but it was also quite watchable... just."
" It really is bad!
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,1,"Oh dear, Nicolas Cage was clearly desperate for a cash injection when he took this one on. What was he thinking?! This film is dire. It's still going on the tv as I write this. I'm done with shooting in holes in the plot and there's only so far you can suspend disbelief at the unrealistic portrayal of the way things work on a modern passenger flight - the blonde airhead flight attendant tottering around in 5 inch platform court shoes whilst panicking and trying to get the captain to give her a hug was particularly annoying all the way through. Then the Christian stuff started up....zzzzzzzzzzz..... Give this one a miss."
" terrific movie
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,10,"I really, really liked this movie. It followed the book as well as possible."
" Lives up to every review on how terrible it is
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,1,Nothing more to add. At least The Knowing was a good movie until the end when you realised it was Scientology propaganda.
" A Whole Lotta Bad Movie With The Kitchen Sink Thrown In
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,4,"12/27/2018 Well, I went back and finished this turkey, it wasn't easy. I did a little skip skip skipping along the way. Obviously a payday for The Caged Buzzard Neck, a time waster for us. The only thing missing were peeble eating zombies and who doesn't love watching a blood thirsty zombie smorgasbord? Terrible acting, lotsa sappy, stupid dialog, a kitchen sink storyline. This movie really suggs! When the movie chips are down, you can count on Cage, it's about to get worse. Bon Appetit"
" New story lines interpretations are a plus. Nothing lost to actual message
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,9,Watched the first series and read the books. Enjoyed this version as well.
" Hilariously enjoyable
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,10,"I can understand every opinion on this movie. Bad, good and people laughing at it. I'm the latter. I'm guessing they were being serious about this being a possibility so maybe that's lost on me but at the end of the day, I had a seriously good laugh so for me, it was a success!! Wouldn't put me off Nicolas Cage or Lea Thompson in the future either. Not every movie is perfect and they didn't write it (I assume!). Open your mind and have a laugh with this one!"
" Cages career is over
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,1,Gone in Sixty Seconds was his last good movie. And it was because of the car too.This movie was horrible and such a waste of time.
" Orribile
",2018-11-29 00:00:00,2,Indubbiamente uno dei peggiori film che abbia mai visto
" Wish I'd checked reviews and rating here first
",2018-11-09 00:00:00,1,"If I had, I could have watched something entertaining instead
Please, don't waste your time.
It starts slow and boring
the rest is just implausible, full of holes and just terrible."
" Dont watch the movie, but please DO read the 10 star reviews. They are hilarious! Best ever WORST picture by Nicholas Cage, no pun intended.
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,1,"In all honesty this movie is a must watch to experience firsthand everything that can go wrong at movie making. Excellent teaching material for film students: HOW TO DELIBERATELY MAKE THE WORST FILM POSSIBLE.Without a doubt Nicholas Cage's WORST movie ever, but it is THAT bad, that it becomes funny again. Recommended for watching when you are drunk with a group of friends, because you wont stop laughing. It is THAT awful, that it becomes funny!Dont get me wrong, I really do admire Nicholas Cage. This man is way up there with the best actors, but since his many divorces he has to pay lots of alimony to his ex-wives and unfortunately he sometimes takes any job he can for the money, regardless of the quality of the script.This movie could become a cult classic, for all those movie fanatics that love to grovel at hilariously awful movies. This is one of them. Enjoy, but only when drunk, because only then it will be bearable!And remember, please do read the 10 STAR reviews of this movie, because they are truly hilarious !!!"

" Truly Terrible
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,1,I saw it had Nicolas Cage in it and story didn't sound too bad... I now wish I had read the reviews... this has to be one of the worst movies ever... Nicolas Cage... what were you thinking!
" Another pathetic remake that misses the mark
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,1,"To be brief, this is just another in a long line of weak hollywood remakes.
this time of a movie from 2000, based on the first book in a long series.
Unlike the book or original movie, this remake foguses ENTIRELY on a very small part of the overall story, even adding in things (such as the midair collision, the son disappearing from his sister's arms, and the emergency landing on a highway) that were never part of the story in order to draw in the ""mindless action"" zombies. Not even using well known actors could save this movie from stinking worse than a backed up sewer line!
In short - DON'T WASTE THE TIME OR MONEY BOTHERING WITH THIS GARBAGE."
" This movie was left behind IN THE TRASH
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,1,"This movie was simply horrible, with bad acting and effects.
DO NOT WATCH IT!!!"
" This entire film should have been Left Behind
",2018-10-06 00:00:00,1,"I've seen some terrible films in my time - some absolutely honking stinkers - but have always been able to quite enjoy them, in a way. This one has the classic ingredients: terrible, terrible dialogue, subpar acting, a wafer-thin plot and even throws in a basic disaster movie cliche for good measure. However it commits the cardinal sin of being totally, overwhelmingly boring. Nothing happens to care about during the entire film, no redeeming terrible-ness. This might be the worst film I've ever watched. 
As a side note apparently Nicholas Cage was paid $3million for this and I have nothing but respect for that."
" 110mins of Pascal's wager and other piffle
",2018-10-01 00:00:00,2,"This movie made its point and that point was ""what if you're wrong?"".
The most ironic twist was that, while the skeptical characters in the film pointed out their justified reasons for not believing in the most commonly agreed upon depicting if a loving God, they were still wrong.... because the rapture happened. 
Digressing from my own philosophical and rational beefs with the entirety of the Abrahamic umbrella model, the scripting, acting, direction, visual effects, overall plot execution of this hypothetical disaster film we're undeniably amateur to the point that, when coupled with the underlying concept being the rapture, it was obviously made by Christian's on a limited budget. I mean REALLY limited, to point where I can only assume Nicholas Cage and Chris Pine contributed as a kind of heart felt attemp at charity (either that or out of desperation to keep debt collectors at an arms length). 
One star for the laughs and another for the fact that I can't deny that I WAS entertained."
" Christian hate film
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,1,"Bigoted movie where good people get ""left behind "" for their lack of faith in a fairy that lives in space."
" Why? Just why?
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,1,"This is,by far, the worst movie I have ever seen, the 2nd one being the 2009 ""Dorian Gray"" directed by Oliver Parker. The only reason ""Dorian Gray"" got 2 stars from me is that Colin Firth was there to soften the blow. Oh my God (pun intended) this is so bad on so many levels. Writing is awful, directing is hell (tee hee), editing is made by windows movie maker, and lets just NOT talk about the acting, ok? This is a movie that everyone did to have some money in their bank accounts and have some change for groceries. 
I truly regret watching it, because I will never be able to forget how dumb this movie was. PLEASE: don't ever watch that movie for any reason."
" Double b's! Bad and boring
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,3,"This Movie is without doubt the worst movie starring Nicolas cage. It is so boring, you won't even get ironic enjoyment!Dont watch this Movie, only if you like boring Movies!"
" Disappointing
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,2,"To be honest when you start watching this film without reading any review on it, it actually seems like a decent 'end of the world' film and the acting isn't at all bad. Up until the point where people start disappearing!!! When I read the movie brief I thought maybe aliens or something but they genuinely just vanish and they don't come back. The movie does not make an ounce of sense and a disappointing film for Nicholas Cage to be involved in as well as Chad Micheal Murray! I just don't understand it!"
" Why is this on Netflix?
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,1,"Concurrent with most of the other reviews on this film - I rated a 1/10. I like Nicholas Cage - he has been on some good movies, and this exemplifies that he has been in some shockingly bad ones too. Not sure how Mr Cage choses his roles..... but this really seemed like a high-school project of a movie - the landing of the plane sequence - I can do better CGI with Windows paint....Anyhow I only kept watching this because our dear 'little' friend on the plane was the comedy factor - he clearly did his research by watching Grumpy in Snow White. Hilarious moment when Mr Grumpy was booted off the plane by typecast Muslim man (he isn't a terrorist)Anyhow - advice is to avoid this garbage, unless you are researching worst film of all time (after ""Look Who is Talking 2"" - that will forever take the crown)"
" Just terrible
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,1,"Acting was terrible, script was horrendous and the elevator music was the cherry on the top of everything. Even the scenario was bad, it looked like a cheap soap opera production. Of course I couldn't get to the end. Nicolas Cage could do so much better than this!"
" Had some potential
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,2,"Mr cage must be desperate or he never read the script before signing up. It had potential but rapidly went down hill once it went religious, I had trouble watching tbh. Unfortunately the script isn't particularly great and things become quite stereotypical. Also, a single devout Muslim and he got left behind when God called. Is that a subtle message?"
" One of the worst movies ever done
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,1,"This is truly one of the worst movies ever done, in each and every single aspect. It is not only me who thinks that, even the audience towards which it was aimed (which was hyper-conservative, extremist christians I guess) panned it mercilessly. Even as a religious person myself I found absolutely no redeeming qualities to this dumpster fire. It makes religious people look like mad people who think that there's no other possibility for salvation except being a spotless and perfect person who has never sinned or had any doubts in any way and makes agnostics and atheists, as well as people from other religions (specially Muslims) look like irredimable sinners and criminals who are bound to suffer due to not agreeing with the movie's viewpoint. 
Direction, dialogue, acting, plot and premise are all completely abysmal. Suffice it to say that even Nicolas Cage's overacting looks good compared to other people in the film. All characters are cringy and all their actions are overwhelmingly stupid (wait until you see the Muslim-hating small person, the paranoid woman who draws a gun on a plane to threaten other passengers because she believes her husband made her daugher vanish into air midflight, the ""investigative journalist"" who everyone seems to know and admire even though it's never explained why, the stewardess named Hattie and the main character who keeps looking for her brother in hospitals and churches and calls home to see if he returned even though he disappeared in front of her leaving all his clothes and his backpack behind). It fails to set any atmosphere or even to keep the attention of any single person who dares watch it. I like movies so bad they're good as they can still be enjoyed as unintentionally funny, and even though this one does have some campily funny moments, the rest of this movie is so unimaginably bad that it only made me wish IMDb allowed people to rate movies with a score under zero."
" Better than reviews or ratings give it credit for
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,7,"I watched this movie with no expectations and while it didn't blow my mind, the concept was interesting and there was enough happening to keep me watching throughout. If you are looking for something with a lot of substance then this isn't the right film, but if you want an easy to watch movie with a natural disaster then this could be your cup of tea."
" Christian Propaganda - VILE
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,1,"The gambler, flirter, liar, Muslim, millionaire, drug user, 'nonbeliever', cheater - all get to stay behind on earth while the 'holy' are magically sucked up to heaven (aka rapture). This movie is best seen whilst being COMPLETELY stoned. It's is a terrible, terrible movie and you shouldn't waste your time with it, unless you're on your way to heaven."
" Worse the bad
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,1,"Absolute crap, unbelievably dumb movie with ridiculous acting, non-sensical plot. So bad it's a little hilarious."
" If this was Russian, we would call it propaganda!
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,2,"I don't mind a movie with a message, but when you push it too hard, the message becomes propaganda. This movie is a 90-minute ad for the Catholic church, and we all did start using ad-blockers at some point, right?"
" Stop the hate...
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,7,"Whilst I appreciate everyone has an opinion, it's hard to believe some of the ratings and jugements made on this movie... I know these days everything is either ""totally amazing"" or ""utter crap"" but the reality is that most things are somewhere in between... And this movie is no different. It is not brilliant, but it is not crap either. Nicholas Cage gets a lot of bad press for his movies, but this I think is a better one that a lot of his latest ones. The story is of course based on the Christian 'Rapture', but that in itself is not rammed down your throat and the movie is not preachy at all. It turns outs it's just a reasonable disaster movie with a sub plot that is setup for more movies in the series as per the books it's based on. The overall acting was good, the effects reflect the movies budget and the script did okay! Not an oscar winner, but also not a bad movie!"
" Made for the Bible Belt.......
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,1,"I knew what I was letting myself in for before I started to watch, but nothing really prepares you for the level of bad acting or the totally mad story.This is worth watching as a comedy, and maybe a bit drunk, but to watch seriously is a mistake.WARNING: 
This Film has one very poor taste (openly racist) area.
I'm assuming as they don't discusse in the film and leave it to the viewer to realise, they think it's OK!!!!One the plane is a Muslim man, clearly religious. 
However when the rapture comes (aaarrrggg) he is left behind, I'm assuming to imply Islam isn't a real religion!!!!!!!!I have to be honest, I'm an atheist so this whole film appears mental to me."
" GREAT MOVIE
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,10,"Wow, I am shocked. This Movie is amazing, It really is the best thing I have ever watched. Nicholas Cage gives an Oscar-Worthy Performance in this. Only the Academy decided No. No Nomination. This movie, the plot is so good. All Evil People finally get their punishment. Life. and the rest. Death. I know so good. Nicholas Cage plays Rayford Steele, A Pilot. Who does the worst thing ever. Flirts with another girl. That results in. ((SPOILERS)). Him getting left behind and navigating a plane in this dystopian world. There are also some other important characters, like this Pastor who doesn't believe in god and A Guy who talks about Area 51 developing. stuff. So good, all are so important to the plot. What did you expect Worse. THIS MOVIE, I have no words. Oh wait. GIVE THIS MOVIE A SEQUEL.P.S: Only Watch this movie if you like Christain Propaganda or a heavily drunk"
" Awful
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,2,"Clunky script terribly acted by unbelievable and underdeveloped characters . I like Nick Cage as a rule , but this his worst film ever and in my bottom 10 of all time. Avoid."
" Comedy?
",2018-06-06 00:00:00,1,"I really thought at some point in the movie that it was a comedy Its such a bad movie that it became unintentionally funny. Was this movie directed by the pope and sponsored by the Vatican? The acting is awful, like a high-school drama classroom. And of course as usual in every american movie, there are guns, baseball bats, a muslim in a plane that passengers think is a terrorist. The errors in the movie are so obvious that it almost looks like they did it on propose. Its fun to watch just to make fun of how terrible it is."
" Falls completely short after it's premise
",2018-06-04 00:00:00,3,"The film starts out okay-ish and it slowly moves to it's premise, which requires a bit of a leap of faith. (But hey, that's okay for SciFi or Fantasy)And then the rest of the story doesn't develop any further. It's all the aftermath of this single event. It just turned into a boring plane disaster movie.I haven't read the book or seen the predecessor, so I went in pretty open-minded. Also a lot of characters act a bit quirky. I thought that would be explained later on or something, but it all just fell flat and became a really boring ordeal overal.My advice; better ways to waste your time."
" Most stupidest movie ever !
",2018-06-04 00:00:00,1,"Most stupid-est movie ever. If you were gonna make a doomsday movie, at least you should have made it about the doomsday! Not about a plane landing and emotional relationship fuss."
" seconds from disaster is better
",2018-06-03 00:00:00,1,"I should have red the reviews, but the description was intresting and hey.. an action movie with NC can t be that bad.. but it was. Spoiled my time watching a sort of flight disaster movie with a religious back story."
" WORST . FILM . EVER!
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,1,"I can't believe I was conned into buying this DVD in a store...the only reason this film got my attention was because of Nicholas Cage...shame on that man for putting his name to this utter garbage!It's preachy...but not just normal self righteous preachy you get in normal life...it's BADLY WRITTEN preachy.Bad acting, bad direction, bad script...worst un-special effects I have seen in 20 years....I felt genuinely embarrassed that I had bought this for the family to watch. After 30 mins of laughing at how totally crap and preachy it was the DVD was removed and destroyed so that no other poor soul may accidently see this in our DVD collection."
" Where's the sick bag?
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,1,"This is the WORST movie ever by a LONG LONG LONG way. It's so bad you've gotta laugh at it or your brain will hurt. I had to take a long shower afterwards I just felt violated by subjecting myself to it (Netflix - what were you thinking?)
 Almost every line is a cliche, you just want ALL the cast to disappear, and the plot (what plot?) is ridiculous. 
And there's no beginning, no middle and no ending! 
I thought it would be perfect material for a (Airplane/Flying High) spoof spin-off, but it's a spoof of itself already!
Best watched very drunk with a group of (even drunker) friends - and ROFL!"
" The worst film I've ever seen
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,1,"I mistakenly put this film on thinking - well it'll be a slightly preposterous disaster film. Alas it's just awful, the script, the acting.... Why on earth is Nicholas Cage in this - did he need the money, is he deeply religious? This film is just wrong in so many ways. I presume it's financially backed by a wealthy Christian group as it's hard to see how else it made it to release. Not recommended unless you watch it for unintentional comedy value."
" Just leave this movie behind
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,1,"Just the worst experience i had in years! Everything is bad: the idea, the screenplay, the acting, the logic, the psychology, the special effects,...
One thing the movie is excellent for: to teach future movie makers how NOT to make a movie!"
" What just happened?
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,1,"I just saw the worst movie ever, that is what happened! Oh My God, oh no, I cannot say that after watching this movie or else I will not go to heaven. Stay away from this movie. Not sure what drugs Nicholas Cage used when he signed for this. Even Sharknado is better than this..."
" It's hard to put your finger on this one..
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,5,"The title and description of this movie are awesome. It's a great concept because this concept could reach alot of people: believers, science fiction lovers, thriller lovers, fantacy lovers, etc.. Unfortunately the movie clearly didn't turn out so well because it won't spark any interest of any group that's interested in the concept.One big reason for this was that the script is written poorly because there's a lack of thought that went into it. Think of these ""millions"" of people that dissapeared while this'd only be around 1/2000 people on earth?! Maybe it's just me, but the street was full of the weirdly foulded clothing of vanished people. Another example would be the poor terms used to just save some time in writing the script such as the plane that could not climb because of some defect that doesn't even exist?! Oh yeah, almost forgot, a plane's collision mid-air and face-to-face would probably end differently realisticly speaking.. Oh nevermind, the explanation of that is even covered in the script: ""oh we were lucky"". Not only was there a lack of thought that went into the script, they just forgot to add the developing feature of the characters. Think of any character. I don't recall any character changing in a significant way. Maybe you could call the apology of the captain to his daughter and wife a development, but I'd say he just learned from a mistake he'd make again.Ok it's clear that the script was written poorly and that they just forgot to add a bunch of stuff, lets talk about the actors. They look like me trying to pretend that I like a present I got that I really don't like. Ofcourse in the movie this effect is reversed: most actors are trying to look sad while they realize that the movie is turning out as a complete miscarriage. Oh just as a sidenote: the lighting, filming and graphics are just trash. I could do the lighting better personally with my samsung device that has no flashlight app on it installed. I could do the filming better without a camera. I could do the graphics better by drawing them by hand. An example of this horrible filming is probably that, at one point, you can physically see that a drone is struggeling to film straight with the wind blowing it away. However, the movie was still enjoyable for me. The main reason for this was the pretty actors ;) and the expectation that something special was going to happen like a sudden plottwist. To sum it all up I'd simply say that the movie wasn't terrible because enough money was put into it, but it was bad. This is a movie where I feel like there's a part missing. A part that I can't put my finger on. A part that got lost because the people responsible for making the film got lazy. If you want to watch this movie, please don't even think of good movies like the Matrix or Forrest Gump to compare it with for your own safety."
" THIS YEAR'S RAZZY
",2018-05-02 00:00:00,2,"Chloe (Cassi Thomson) is a smart college student coming home to see her family. Unfortunately dad (Nicolas Cage) is a pilot who has to work and has a hot date with a stewardess (Nicky Whelan). Dad and daughter meet at the airport and discuss how they must be supportive of mom (Lea Thompson) who is more far gone than stage four cancer...she has Jesus!Thirty minutes into the film and BAM! The rapture happens and it seems the people who really held this world together were not secular after all, but raptured Christians...except for cheating pilots, stews, EMTs, news casters, and midgets. Nice to know that after the rapture, the circus and Fox News will still be the same.After the rapture we are all concerned...will the father unite with her daughter? How will they cope knowing their two missing family members are in heaven...and HEY! We just had the rapture! Who cares about two characters we never got to like in the first place? Boring.The film lost its entertainment value after the rapture and maybe that is the real metaphor there.2 stars at best. No swearing, sex, or nudity. No actors were raptured during the making of this film."
" Left speechless
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,1,"""Left behind"" has me struggling to find words to describe it. ""Bad"", ""ghastly"" or even stronger language all seem so inadequate.First of all, there is no Biblical basis for this ""Rapture"". Although Rapture fundamentalists claim that more than 20 verses in the Bible support the concept of ""Rapture"", examination of these verses (eg Romans 8: 18 - 19) shows they only use phrases such as the ""eager expectation"" of the second coming or, more unnervingly, refer to ""multitudes in the dust who sleep will awake"" (Daniel 12 v 1 - 2; see also Revelations 20, verses 4 and 5) which sounds like zombies rising from the grave (a scenario fortunately missing from this truly appalling movie). I am not sure which verse in the Bible is the basis for the rapturees' clothes remaining behind, although 1 Corinthians 15: 51 - 6=53 does refer to them being clothed with ""the imperishable"". There is a reference to ""gathering"" of the elect in Mark 13 but not even Revelations speaks about people vanishing as they are being lifted from the ground with their clothes behind them in the manner shown in this film.Second, the script and acting are terrible (I know Nicholas Cage has tax problems, but really..) and the special effects are laughable - the plane was a different make in each of its scenes, as one of the other reviewers has pointed out, the storms etc looked fake and the big city on fire at the end (spoiler alert!!) looked like a painting, and a bad one at that. Even the props are off, like the air hostess's crazy shoes, and what is wrong with Nicholas Cage's hair??? And nobody was on social media - how real is that.Third, the ethics and morals are questionable. The real missing people seem to be blacks - where are they all? There is a token Asian who is a nerd; does this mean that all Asians are going to hell? You can be a good religious person but if you are Moslem (like the guy on the plane), too bad. And the rapture only seems to happen to people who speak English. It is not even clear if this is happening outside America.There are intelligent, insightful films made about the Rapture. In fact, ""The Rapture"", starring Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, is one of the most compelling and insightful films I have ever seen on any subject. The reason fundamentalists don't like this film is because it exposes the flaws in Rapture thinking, especially the extraordinary ending, which I won't reveal because I don't want to spoil it for others.I see ""Left Behind"" was nominated for awards - for the Razzies, that is. I am surprised it did not win. How could any other film in 2014 have been worse?In terms of general comparison with other ""worst films ever made"", this film has none of the low-budget problems producers like Ed Wood had, or the political stench of Nazi films like Jew Suss. What it is, however, is a propaganda film, rather like the propaganda ballets promoted like Qiang Qing which were used to destroy ballet and opera during the Cultural Revolution. Like all truly frightening propaganda, it is designed to terrify the audience into agreeing.On another topic, I have a complaint to make. Why does IMDb require all reviewers to put at least one star? To give even one star to a film of this kind is too generous."
" I'm speechless...
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,1,"Words cannot describe how s**t this movie was, luckily had a bottle of wine during it. The whole concept was just as worse as the sharknado."
" This movie is a hate crime
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,1,"I started watching this cinematic abortion on Netflix after '2012', a MUCH better movie about the world ending. You see, I'm on a bit of an apocalyptic kick considering the subject is less depressing than the tragedy that is the United States right now, under the tangerine idiot. Anyway, the whole reason I did was that I was under the impression it was going to be like a Twilight Zone-type movie, and with someone like Nicholas Cage in it, I figured it couldn't be horrendous. I'm surprised I got as far into it as I did, although after working for more than half a decade in a contact centre, my patience level is pretty high. The story is crap, the writing is crap, the acting is crap, and if this is the kind of crapola Nick Cage is taking on, he should retire forever. Lea Thompson could have made it the rest of her life on Lorraine McFly money without doing this piece of trash. I didn't pay anything other than my subscription to Netflix for this, but somehow I feel utterly raped of my time and actually feel slightly dumber than I was, and should be monetarily compensated for my loss. At least this ""film"" did help me understand one thing. This is the reason Trump is president. It now makes more sense to me that people actually put him into the position of power, now that I know that people actually created this and worse, people actually watched and enjoyed it. I think a petition needs to be started to have the title of this film officially changed to just "" *vomit noise* """
" Wow.
",2018-03-13 00:00:00,1,"I signed up to review this.. im blown away by how bad this movie is. And dispite the onslaught of terrible acting from pretty much everyone, somehow Nic still shines like a beacon determined to out-terrible the crowd, although he does fall just short of his daughter who takes the crown of crapness. The writing is terrible, cinematography is stale as old bread, and i cant even talk about the writing without getting mad. This is the movie version of Rebecca Blacks ""hit"" Friday."
" This is the only review you need to read

Simply, D O N O T W A T C H T H I S M O V I E!
Trust me, do not watch it. There are better things you can do, e.g.:
take the bins out and go for a runmake yourself protein pancakesemail your boss and tell them you hate your job... whatever just do not watch this movie.I beg you."
" Integral view - Aimed purely at conventional, mythic literal people, even they didn't all like it
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,1,I knew nothing of the basis of the movie before seeing it. I thought it could have been a much bigger concept. I could not believe the main point of the story was to advertise Christianity and then just focus on the airplane issue. I think it should be re-made as a comedy.
" wow an abomination of a movie
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,2,"300-400 years ago, the art created in the name of the church, the paintings, the music, the buildings were all inspirational and lifted mankind up. None of that artistic greatness can possibly be sufficient recompense for how truly bad this movie is. I thought it was a disaster movie, but it was a disastrous movie."
" So terrible I couldn't stop vomiting.
",2018-03-03 00:00:00,1,"This movie has to be the worst thing I've ever seen, and I've seen the first half of Sharknado. Having Nicolas Cage on the poster of a disaster movie is a juicy temptation like an anglerfish luring in its prey before consuming them without conscience or mercy.The ONE thing in the film that I actually got some entertainment from was the dwarf punt for no reason at the end.To the producers: You should be ashamed. Please go away to wherever it's illegal to make movies. And take Michael Bay with you."
" Truly awful film ... avoid
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,1,I watched this film recently on Netflix and thought it would be a decent actioner given it's star Nicholas Cage and the write up. It is anything but and a truly awful film. I have wasted approximately two hours of my life on this which I will never get back. Please avoid if you have a life.
" Oh Dear
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,1,"My Goodness, Nicholas Cage will clearly do anything for money. He apparently received $3m for this absolute rubbish. Shame on you Nicholas, shame on you. There are certain stars that attract me because they have integrity and even if I have not heard of the movie I will generally give it a go.
And then there is Cage. 
I was unfortunately sent to catholic school and this movie reminded me of the c, d or e grade propaganda flicks that we were forced to watch when phys ed was cancelled due to rain.
The acting is woeful, the cinematography very soap opera.
The plot was promising, a bit Stephen King (Langoliers) so I gave it a go. 
Don't make the same mistake I did.
You have been warned."
" A rare film indeed
",2018-02-13 00:00:00,4,"This film joins the exclusive list of movies --- only five or ten of 'em --- that are so incredibly bad that they're actually quite good. It is so enjoyable to watch one stupid scene cascade into the next; to express amazement that people actually allowed their names to be used in the credits. Again, it meets the important criterion of providing a hearty debate over coffee the next morning, pondering questions such as What was it all about? Where did all the people go? How can a jet collide with another yet survive? What dramatic purpose did the midget serve? Did it set a record for the number of errors in one scene? Does the ""born again"" movement really believe that such ludicrous nonsense promotes its cause. Indeed, if hell exists, it's probably a place where every theatre and every television station shows ""Left Behind"" over and over again for eternity. That concept is so intimidating , even the worst sinner will shout fervent Hallelujahs in an effort to evade such a ghastly fate. God's ways are indeed strange.
If the motion picture academy had an Oscar for ""Worst Movie"", this would be the overwhelming winner for 2014. Likewise ""Stupidest Film."" It obviously will never be shown as an in flight movie. Airlines don't want passengers using the escape hatch in flight."
" I have seen better films...
",2018-02-07 00:00:00,1,"For those of you who are interested in the study of the art of film, and need an exercise in calibration and a baseline with which to tell good from bad, I can wholeheartedly recommend this movie as the best way to finally and definitively answer the question ""what is the worst movie of all time?"".Nic Cage must either be dead broke, owe someone the favour to end all favours, or else some Producer has his children held captive. A more wretched pile of steaming sputum was never coughed into existence, including during the 7 years that the Black Death swept across Europe. The script was woefully primitive; better dialogue could easily have been written by encouraging a disease-riddled crow to randomly peck away at a typewriter for 5 minutes.The acting was pathetic. Alarm bells should have rung for me when I saw a supporting cast comprising Chad Michael-Murray, some girl from Neighbours, a former American Idol contestant, and Marty McFly's mum off of Back to the Future. The special effects looked like they were done on a Spectrum ZX81. The pacing and editing was turgid and lumbering, the soundtrack was uninspiring, amateurish and jarring, even the lighting was dull, flat, and caused me to squint like a coal miner resurfacing after a 40-hour shift. The humour, or attempts at it, were uncomfortable and awkward, centering on a running gag of mis-trust between a Muslim and a Little Person getting angrier and angrier with each other which climaxes at the end with the Muslim booting the Midget down the inflatable escape slide of the plane. It sounds like it could be funny, even just for the slapstick. It isn't. This affront to celluloid isn't even in the ""so bad it's good"" bucket, as even Christian film reviewers (for this IS the story of The Rapture after all) slammed this movie quicker than Judas turns snitch at the sight of some silver.If someone offers you the chance to watch this movie, or as I did you see it pop up on Netflix and get suckered in by the Sci-Fi sounding synopsis and decide to give it a shot, I can highly recommend taking yourself into your back garden and liberally beating yourself around the genitals with a half-brick. It will be a less painful experience."
" Praise Allah
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,1,"What a great movie, it forced me to become a Muslim ! Hallelujah !"
" Great premise, not enough snails
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,4,"I am Roger Ebert but I forgot the password to my main account soz so I have to use my gay son's.However.I was really excited to hear that there was finally a film showcasing the life and times of snail-humans, so I rushed to the hospital immediately to see it (they were showing it to people with Chronic Bladder Onions (CBO)). However.The film started off promisingly, with Snail Boy (Mayor Dodson) really giving the performance of his career, giving the third best snail performance I've ever seen (after Snail Sleepover, and SnailMail: The Spiral Trilogy). 
However.I'd heard beforehand that the giant snail shell, which the producers had spent 90% of the budget on, had been lost during production. The camera tricks to hide this fact worked at first - very clever, oh yes - but they lost their effect quite quickly. For the rest of the film, you could definitely tell that he didn't have a shell.However.The grotesque shell-less snail boy delighted and disgusted in equal measure. The film could have done with about five or six or seven or eight or nine or ten or eleven or twelvety hundred thousand more snails, but I can forgive this, given the delightful Donald Trump cameo as Hillary Clinton.Although.The film reaches it's climax with Snail Boy returning from heaven with 1 billion Yorkshire Puddings - one too many! This is a recurring theme from the director, but it has yet to get old - you've done it again, Spielberg!!However."
" Absolutely awful
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,1,"Terrible eating, terrible story. How did Cage get involved in this?"
" My Eyes, My Beautiful Eyes
",2017-11-22 00:00:00,1,"I can't believe you have to actually give a star minimum. 30 minutes in and I'm already thinking that the acting is atrocious. I try see through that and go along for the plot line, realizing very quickly what's going on here is not the makings of a good movie.Poor Nic Cage. Although if I was being paid, I probably wouldn't care either.All I know is 30 minutes in and off it goes. What did I just watch? My eyes hurt!"
" Awful
",2017-11-21 00:00:00,1,"Where should I begin, so thought the movie, and before anyone new it, this pile of garbage was pretty much over. One of these terrible movies where you are not even entertained because of how hilarious it is, but just bored out of how lame it is. This movie makes ""The happening"" look good, then you know exactly how awesome this ""movie"" is. What else to say about this movie? Awful, just awful!"
" If I Had Been Raptured While Watching This Movie I Wouldn't Have Minded
",2017-11-17 00:00:00,3,"As a non-fundamentalist Christian, I remember when the Tim LaHaye book (on which this is based) came about. It stirred a lot of excitement in those fundamentalist circles. I was never especially interested in it; never read it. To be honest I wasn't especially interested in the movie either (and never watched the earlier Kirk Cameron version.) But - hey - it's on Netflix; I had a free afternoon. How bad could it really be? Well, pretty bad. It isn't as awful as some people say it is. To be honest, the actual moment of rapture was kind of well done. People's clothes just dropping to the ground as they disappear leaving everybody else with either mouths agape or screaming in terror. It was kind of cool. And it's true that millions of people (whether Christians or anyone else) just simply disappearing all at the same time would cause chaos around the world - although we didn't see much of the world. Just a bit of New York City and mostly the airplane.You see, most of this movie is set on an airplane. Nicolas Cage plays the pilot - Captain Ray Steele (which is a kind of a cool name - kudos to LaHaye for coming up with it in the novel.) The Steele family is divided. Ray and his daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson) are non- believers (Ray's having an affair with a flight attendant played by Nicky Whelan), while Irene (mom) and Raymie (young son) must be believers - 'cause they get taken to heaven, meaning we don't see much of them. I thought the scenes on the plane were semi- believable at times. Passengers had a variety of reactions - aliens or time travel or conspiracy or whatever. There were times of panic - although by the end everybody seemed surprisingly calm. There's a wee bit of suspense as the plane approaches New York City with no fuel. But overall the story and characters were pretty weak.As for the theology, or at least the moral message? Well, first of all all children go to heaven. Because we get told that there are no children left. No age was attached. Do you get a free pass to heaven until you're - 10? 13? 16? I don't know. And, boy, once those Christians are gone it turns out that most of those who are left are looters or related thug-like folks, because there's lots of looting. And most of the Christians who were portrayed before the rapture were of the - shall we say - extremist variety, so this is clearly a triumphalistic sort of message from the fundamentalist community - come over to our side because we're gonna win! And there was really no great attempt to explain the idea of the rapture. It's not an idea that's universally accepted among Christians, and it's really a kind of bizarre idea. This is obviously supposed to be a sort of religious propaganda; an evangelistic tool meant to unfortunately scare people into believing that they better believe or this terrible thing is going to happen and you're gonna be ""left behind."" But scaring people into faith rarely works in my experience, and if it does it calls into serious question the very reason why a person would believe. The Christian faith as I understand it is supposed to put the focus on caring for others; this kind of evangelism tells you that you should be worried about yourself. And there's that irritating song that closed the movie out that I hadn't heard in years. ""I wish we'd all been ready. ... The Son has come, and you've been left behind.""This isn't as absolutely horrible as some people say it is - although I wouldn't have objected to being raptured during it. I could have seen that as an act of divine mercy. Of course, I wasn't raptured during it, but I will confess that I fell asleep and missed the last 20 minutes of it - but I was interested enough to go back and see how it ended. Everything's kind of left up in the air - maybe leaving open the possibility of a sequel, since there have been Lord knows how many books in the series. I doubt that will happen. I would think this has a very niche market. Fundamentalist Christians might yearn for more. Others (like me) might check it out on Netflix, but I certainly wouldn't pay to see a sequel in a theatre or specifically rent a DVD of a sequel. (3/10)"
" I am taking the director to court for making this film and ruining my night.
",2017-11-02 00:00:00,1,"I feel violated. I wasted 1 hour 51 minutes of my life on this dead piece of sh*t film. I want to sue to director for creating this film it's that bad. The most stupid story line in history, you think it might get better but it really doesn't. Why Nicholas Cage is in this film I have absolutely no idea."
" I should have left that one behind...
",2017-10-30 00:00:00,1,"Every time I log into Netflix this movie shows up, and I always pass it. For some reason beyond my understanding, I finally decided to give it a go.*Minor Spoiler Ahead* After five minutes into it, I already knew it would stink. Nicolas Cage, as an airline captain, arrives for a JFK-LHR flight with no briefcase, no suitcase, not even a folio or envelope. No Way! As an airline pilot, I know no one would do this (well, maybe a very rookie First Officer, not a seasoned Captain). Even for a short maintenance flight, we take at least some rucksack or small briefcase.From that point on-wards it only goes worse and worse, and worse.Zero character development, zero story, zero technical accuracy, zero humour.Can I have my time back? Avoid it at any cost"
" A bad film with deservedly low user rating
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,1,"The first attempt to make a film of Tim Lahaye's book was made in 2000, with 1/4 of this film's budget. It has quite a low user rating (4.6) mainly because non-believers didn't like the Christian fundamentalist aspects of the story. But compared to this film, it tells A LOT more story, is A LOT more dramatic and generally works as a reasonable piece of story telling, regardless of whether you can believe the main scenario or not. By comparison, this film tells virtually nothing of the main theme of the book (and the earlier film), explains nothing about the views of the 'crazy' Christians, and even has to be politically correct by showing a Muslim being all nicey-nicey to other passengers. There is little or poor character development, no-one I felt any real sympathy for - Cage's character seems a weak-willed mushy non- entity; the stewardess (Hattie) that he supposedly has been having an affair with is unattractive and incompetent; a spoiled daughter; an illiterate wife... the list could go on! It's low rating (3.1 at time of writing) is more than it deserves! Millions of people are supposed to have vanished at the same time - this would result in chaotic catastrophe on a vast scale, but we see next-to-nothing of this! Surely some CGI could have produced massive vehicle pile-ups, maybe a few downed aircraft, or the odd Then the daughter supposedly in heroine mode, lights a signal for her father to land the plane, by setting light to a few fuel barrels - in the middle of chaos which would have had hundreds of fires burning, that you get just a glimpse of right near the end! There are so many faults in the film due I presume to poor or non- existent research, that it doesn't even make a half- decent air- disaster movie. Look at the 'Goofs' section, you'll see what I mean. What a rubbish waste of $16,000,000 !!!"
" Not as bad as the critics and ratings said
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,5,"""Left behind"" is a movie about people who disappear and about those who stay behind. In the middle of it all are a pilot (Nicolas Cage), his daughter and a plane full of less or more annoying or even ridiculous characters. The acting and dialogues leave something to be desired. The story is about average. It has some tense moments. It's just that the producers of the movie tried too hard. They put every single stereotype in the plane. They had an interesting topic but mostly wasted its potential.Let's put it this way: If it ran on TV and I had nothing better to watch, I'd probably watch it and say ""It's okay. Not the worst way to spend the time""."
" Avoid
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,1,"First half hour is nicely built up albeit with TV movie cast. But then.. oh dear. Should have heeded the other reviews, embarrassing.There is the comfort of knowing that everyone associated with this will feel a cringe of embarrassment as long as they live. Except the religious ones and judging by this they are beyond reach."
" A voyage to the deepest depths of boredom
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,1,"This was the first full movie we watched on our new home theatre system and we viewed the movie on a 120"" projected image. I can honestly say that this only further highlighted how bad this movie really is.I could tell from the cheesy music score and terrible acting right at the beginning of 'Left Behind' that this was going to be a dud. I was hoping that at least the sound effects would make up for it and I could test my speaker setup but that was not to be. I could have listed to the whole movie on only my left front speaker and it would have sounded the same.To have a group of talented actors, a huge budget and a promising story go so horribly wrong is truly the work of an imbecile. This film looks very much like an amateur production and the actors no matter how hard they tried couldn't pull the movie around. This is a shallow and boring film with very little action. Nic Cage tried his best as did Cassi Thomson and Chad Murray but the poor filming, cheesy music and bad directing just made this movie a complete flop."
" Rip off of 'the langoliers' but really crap
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,2,"I generally like this genre but this was exceptionally badI felt it was a rip off of Stephen King's langoliers except had no believability whatsoever. It came across as stupid. Interesting concept - passengers on airline just 'disappear' leaving a pile of the clothes their wearing. Other passengers therefore want to storm the cockpit. duh! Meanwhile other people on the ground disappear too, but it just came across as 'stupid'. This film was so stupid and nonsensical I stuggle to write anything coherent."
" Not as zealous as the other two versions but still third rate. Fourth rate?
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,3,"The plot: All of a sudden, millions (?) of people disappear into thin air, leaving just their clothes behind. Is the xtian rapture thing?So, I expected a much more in your face preachy xtian movie, but it mentions the religious aspect just a few times, and not very forcefully. The movie is way more about the plane almost crashing than anything else. The 2016 version is way worse, paranoid and ReichWing.The biggest question of the movie remains unanswered: Do the clothes that are left behind include underwear? If they do, does that mean that xtians are going to heaven/purgatory ....COMPLETELY NAKED???? That seems kind of perverse.For a supposed xtian movie it has a lot of cleavage shots with jiggly breasts of their female lead, Cassi Thompson. She's Australian. Even without the religious mumbo-jumbo it's just a low budget movie with a poor script and hardly any production value. How they got the three main protagonists to sign for this crap is the real mystery, but if anything, it underlines the plummeting career of Cage.3/10 The Melancholic Alcoholic."
" Not that bad
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,6,"I watched this out of pure boredness, just to pass the time. Sure, it's not that great - still better than Episode VII- but it's definitely not a one star movie, I would give it a solid 5 out of 7. It doesn't get annoying with religious stuff, I'm an atheist and found it very bearable. It's just a very mediocre film without much of a story but it's watchable if there really is nothing else to watch."
" No, don't, it's terrible.
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,1,"Awful movie that unless you are an extreme Christian with no idea on how people really are, you will be bored out of your mind. Constantly saying no, no, people don't act like that Stop, it's to dumb for words. It's not even good to make fun of since it's not even so funny it's bad. That's saying something for a Cage movie, and it's still horrible. Go watch the wicker man if you want a religious film that's so bad it's good."
" The Worst Movie in the WORLD!!!

" Awful performances, bad directing.
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,1,"As a Christian i'm disappointed in the constant weak representation of Christian movies. ""Left Behind 2014"" is dreadful, the actors are terrible (Nicholas Cage is usually a good actor as well as Chad Michael Murray from 'One Tree Hill', but even they cannot make this movie entertaining) the director isn't a good one, whoever directed this obviously didn't push the actors into giving decent performances, their acting is bland and boring with no life whatsoever, when a director does not urge actors to be more realistic they just end up doing what they want and not putting any effort in, however the girl who plays Nicholas Cage's daughter is not that bad, her hostility towards Christians is realistic (as there's too many people like that out there today).The plot is biblical, the pacing is just very slow.Unfortunately there are not many entertaining Christian movies out there, there are some, but not many, i recommend watching the original ""Left Behind"" movies starring Kirk Cameron, they are much more lively and interesting."
" Religious Propaganda
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,2,"It is a huge waste of time. This movie is a religious propaganda tool. Moralist and judgmental. Actor's play are on and off, sometimes you feel they were counting in between interactions. Nothing good comes from a closed minded piece of cr*p like this movie. Sinners will die and people who believe in the true god will survive. What is wrong with Hollywood?"
" As a Christian ...
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,1,"I'm thoroughly ashamed of this drivel. It's an arrogant, thoughtless and harmful propaganda piece that showcases the very worst of Christian moralizing.Looking beyond that to production values, there is literally nothing redeeming one can say about it. Cage is painfully out of place in this juvenile production which feels like it was penned by children. The incidental music is awful, the acting is ludicrous and the whole thing feels like it was shot by a camera team who's only experience is in a Home Shopping studio.I've often enjoyed movies with poor production values. I've often felt engaged by movies who's message I didn't entirely agree with...... but I cannot remember a time that a movie actually made me feel personally insulted.And there's a sequel on the way? For the love of God, Stop!"

" Script
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,1,"The movie itself wasn't bad, as movies go. But the story line is absolutely not what the Bible teaches about the tribulation and final battle. It's not even close. This story uses the teachings of religions, INSTEAD of the teachings of the Bible as it's basic premise. I would have felt much better if it actually sought to educate people about what God said about this time we are in, the very end of the end times."
" Not good.
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,2,"I'm not sure why I gave this a rating of 2 - probably feeling generous; on another day I'd probably go with a -22. This movie was so bad - and I'm talking bad beyond words, Max Bialystock would have been proud of it. Memo to Cage: next time you're offered a script like this just respond with a dignified - noooooooooooooooo. Lousy story, production values that would do justice to a 3rd grade school pantomime; dialogue that defied belief - and they were its strong points. I've read that there's possibly some kinda religious message contained in this movie ... em, no. The movie could have done with some editing - having the closing credits immediately following the opening credits would have been a start. Apart from all of the above, it was fine."
" What if this is satire?
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,3,"This film is very confusing. Is it an action/disaster movie in search of an enabling premise of biblical proportions, or is it a Christian promo keeping it real by engaging impressive special effects?Many reviewers urge potential viewers not to watch this movie, and it certainly would not have been worth paying for. But on a slow Thursday night on Freeview it does have entertainment potential, partly for the aeroplane action (always a winner for me) and to watch Nicholas Cage wrestling with the script and to keep a straight face. My companion summed it all up with 'Nicholas Cage isn't an entertainer, is he? He's an actor, he will literally take ANYTHING for the money'. It occurred to me that it might well be satirical. In particular because the Muslim gentleman, despite being very nice, was so obviously 'left behind' for picking the wrong god. For the atheist there's no better shot than that. The totally LOL chucking of the midget down the evacuation slide' was equally un-PC. Which is great fun these days. A lot of people think the book of Revelation is jolly good farce.Perhaps someone said, 'What if half the passengers on a plane just disappeared? What would happen? We could have fun with that!' Plane stories are great because they provide isolated, trapped and cut-off groups of strangers primed to become obligingly hysterical. And instead of aliens, time warps or anything covered in The Twilight Zone, they went with mass ascension, just for shits and giggles.And the end, (which is 'just the beginning' according to the more damaged half of the daddy/daughter issue that apocalypse movies are currently so fond of) is just an absolute gem. The fires of Hell, caused by the sudden absence of the God's people who stop things catching on fire, appear to be waiting for those left behind. In secular Britain, we'd still have about 70 per cent of the population left to recover civilisation, and quite a few less quite annoying people to make it harder.For all the aforementioned comedy moments I give it a goodhearted 3 stars."
" Holy Moly! Probably the Worst Film Ever made
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,1,"This film has no redeeming features...it takes the form of a low-budget made-for-TV movie, even though it isn't. A terrible plot, badly acted, badly directed, corny music, corny dialogue, cliché after cliché. Every single minute of screen time is a total waste of a minute. I know everyone rags the career of Nicholas Cage but, even though I don't particularly rate him as an actor myself, he does appear in two of my favorite films - Raising Arizona and 8mm, so he must have something. Nevertheless, I can think of no reasonable or logical reason why he agreed to appear in this strange, evangelical Christian, turkey of a movie. The film is supposed to be about the 'rapture' and the sudden disappearance of most of the people on earth but this theme is almost a minor sub-plot to the main disaster movie theme of a damaged plane low on fuel with no where to land rescued by an 18-year old girl with the ability to drive any and all heavy plant and earth-moving machinery. It's far too earnestly Christian for any normal movie goer and no where near Christian enough for true believers. Basically, it fails on all fronts."
