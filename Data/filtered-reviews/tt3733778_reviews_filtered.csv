" Made Better
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,3,Of all the best films Cage has done. Pay the Ghost is by far his worst with a rating of just 10% in the rotten tomatoes one can understand why his career has dried up.
" good movie
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,9,"During a night parade in New York, Professor Mike Cole's little son disappears without a trace. The police are unable to find the child, but after their own investigation, the father learns that some powerful ancient curse takes the children every year. To get his son back, the man decides to use the only chance - on the night of Halloween to go to the other side of the darkness."
" Horrible
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,3,Seriously don't. This movie is a complete mess with a terrible storyline. The only scary part of the movie was Nick Cage's acting. It's a complete disservice to the horror/thriller genre! Only watch this if you want to spend 1.5 hours getting angry at the TV.
" Less than zero.
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,2,"Cage has two acting personas: GOOD and SUCKS. He either knocks it out of the park or bunts down the third base line. Unfortunately in this mashup he proves to, once again, just gotta make that car payment!! Poor, tired sets. Cheap, lazy screen shots and little to no enthusiasm on anyone's part! Very sad wore out movie. Don't bother with it. Take the family out for ice cream!!"
" It's a fun suspense style movie set during Halloween holiday
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,10,"Sure there are some cheesy parts, but who cares, I sure don't! I actually love it when scary suspense movies have a little bit of ""cheese""! I give it 10-stars because this is just my type of Halloween suspense movie (not a ""slasher"" flick) and I love all Nicholas Cage's films!"
" Why soo many bad reviews?
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,8,"My husband and I and our 14 year old daughter watched this and we all liked it. A little cussing not too bad, no sex or nudity which is the only way I will watch a movie. It's just not necessary and ruins a good film. Any way great story, a little creepy but that's what we like this time of year! Def. Would recommend!"
" Not bad
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,6,Sci-fi thriller completo with other-worldly beings loosely constructed into a Halloween tale.
" Better Than Expected
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,6,"This was not bad. A ghost story with decent special effects. The characters are likable and the acting is good. It made me jump a few times, lol. Watch and judge for yourself don't just go by the reviews."
" Wait. Nicolas Cage used like a real actor in good old ghost story? Go figure!
",2020-09-11 00:00:00,6,"Here are some things this movie is not: It's not gory. It's not a constant assault on your ears. It's not a world-level apocalypse. It's not nonstop ghouls or ghosts or bonecrushing action. In short, it's not any of the things that put so many of our current movies so far over the top.It occurred to me at the end that I was grateful to everyone involved. They made a very straightforward ghost story with some unexpectedly effective human scale movements and some very credible takes on parents who lose a child. It's not about losing the child. That's more complex and not supernatural. This is a ghost story built on top of the loss of a child, and that loss is well enough handled to provide some unexpected opportunities for the performers, especially Sarah Wayne Callies as Kristen, the mom.I'm also grateful on another score: Someone apparently believed that Nicolas Cage could still be a competent actor in human scale role and took on the job of reining him in or whatever it took to get him to show and do the job.It's just a good little ghost story. It's not brilliant, but it's clever enough. I was pleasantly surprised as things kept developing without great leaps or Earth-shattering revelations of staggering proportions. They found a good little premise. They built on it well enough to craft an entertaining hour and a half. And they just got on with it.I'll side with everyone who said that it is not something you can call excellent. That's true. Sometimes, though, good enough is good enough. This is good enough to give it a watch and enjoy a movie which could have been a bit better, but of a kind and scale I wish they made more of these days.In short: If a good old-fashioned ghost story will entertain you, you'll enjoy this. Everyone in cast and crew does a credible job, and no character does anything stupid. Thank you!"
" Better than you think.
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,10,I love these supernatural horror movies. This one has a great story almost like a Scooby Doo movie. The performances were really good and the special effects were fantastic. Definitely worth a look.Tim Treakle
" Let's Go Home!!!
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,3,"So this one begins in New York 1679. That's certainly a long time ago!!! Some kids in a basement dreading something walking around up above them. They hear screaming up there and one kid shouts 'Mother!' Ruh Roh. That most likely didn't work out well for those kids!!!Cut to....modern day I guess? Another kid sleeping in bed...wakes up to noises and shadow outside his window. He runs to wake up his mother!!! Mommy says he's having a bad dream and takes him into bed to keep him 'safe'.Next we go to good ol Nick Cage!!!! He's at WORK studying something. He takes a cab home! This is NY City of course you take a CAB!! He grabs sleeping son and returns son to his own bed!! Kid asks DAD to check outside his window. Dad looks out there and says 'ALL CLEAR!'Cage's day job apparently is teaching literature to college students. He gets a letter of good news. Then is on his way home!!! To carve a pumpkin with his kid! for halloween!! He gets home late when his Kid is already done Trick or Treating! Kid wants to go to the carnival, just for a little bit!!! Mom says it's okay!!! Dad takes Kid to Carnival!! What could possibly go wrong????!~??!?!?!?So Charlie , the kid, he keeps seeing some big vulture flying around. And when Dad is buying Charlie an ice cream, Charlie vanishes from sight!!! Cage searches frantically!!!!! Mom and Dad both search all over but Charlie is no where to be found!!!Charlie is gone!! Cage is in the doghouse with his wife. Apparently Charlie has been missing for weeks when CAge goes and talks to Cop and calls him Lazy. CAge thinks he sees Charlie on a bus but when he chases bus and gets on it to search it he finds an empty seat where Charlie was!!!-1 Star here for 20 people standing on the bus while there are 2 empty seats near the back for Cage to find. Derrr...So Cage keeps seeing this cryptic message. Pay the Ghost, everywhere. He follows it into the underground and finds a wall covered with the phrase over and over. Pay The Ghost.So after doing some research, Cage and Wife go find another parent of another missing child. He tells them he has to PAY THE GHOST!!! He sees visions of his daughter!!!So everyone starts experiencing visions of old costumed kids and apparitions as this PAY THE GHOST rhetoric gets tossed around. More and More Odd things start happening. So Wife brings in a medium to attempt to make contact with Charlie. The medium checks out Charlie's bedroom window and boy does she make contact!!!! She is tossed hard against the wall and something strangled her and killed her!!! The Cops are really interested in a crime here!!!Wife starts to warm back up to CAGE , but during the night she wakes up to a Drawing by her bed of Charlie in his pirate costume peering out from behind a huge dark shadowy humanoid shape!!! When Cage goes upstairs, Kirsten / Mom is possessed by voice of Charlie!!! Charlie tells Cage he's scared and 'he's coming' and to 'save me' But Cage doesn't know where to look?? Oh wait Kirsten carved a mark in her arm. What does it mean???In the morgue, an autopsy is being performed on the dead medium. The dead medium opens her mouth during the autopsy, freaking out the doctor. The Doctor calls the Cop in , it looks like the medium was set on fire from the inside. Everything inside her is burned!!!Cage and Wife go to investigate a Celtic Halloween ceremony. Yeah because those happen all the time!!Okay seriously? -1 STar for Cage's friend getting thrown out a 3rd floor window at the University!!! Like the Ghost has ultimate knowledge of anyone even thinking about it!!!Now the Ghost is actually standing in full view on buildings in New York with its pet vulture flying around. CAge goes to the Blind Man in the Sewers. He's familiar with a bridge to a portal that is open to the alternate world where Cage's boy is being held!! Wow this is really dumb!!!In this alternate world which is filled with FOG, Cage experiences the burning of the Celtic witch, who I guess became this Ghost! And then he finds the witches House, and goes into the basement, where he sees.....hundreds of children, maybe thousands!!! There's a sea of them, most in Halloween costumes as that is when they were taken. All with DEAD eyes. Is Charlie among them??? No one answers his call!! But he just HAPPENS TO RUN INTO CHARLIE!!! CAGE tries to get Charlie and 2 other kids out!!! They run back towards the BRIDGE!!!! OH NO THE GHOST IS ON THE BRIDGE!! I SURE DIDNT SEE THAT COMING!! GHOST tosses Cage around like a rag doll, but CAge isnt as easily killed as that medium was for some reason!! And the spirits of all the other dead kids swirl around the Witch Ghost and take her away. Just as bridge collapses and portal closes! CAge is just in time able to save those 3 kids. Altho he almost falls into the abyss with Charlie, but is JUST ABLE TO SAVE CHARLIE BEFORE PORTAL CLOSES!!!Wow that was dramatic!!!! CAGE brings Charlie home to crying MOM, and Charlie appears to not remember anything that happened!!! Mom is so so HAPPY!!Wow that was really dumb. 3/10"
" Nicholas Cage working hard to solve a mystery
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,5,"For people who really like Nicholas Cage, this film is a good one. You will enjoy it. If you ar not into Cage, then you should probably move on. It's not really scary but creepy. Kid missing, Cage is on it. So so effects."
" Potentially Good Idea Fell Flat
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,3,"Even though it was Nic Cage, I was hopeful. I've seen some good performances and good films from him among the drek. But this one played like a C-grade made-for-TV movie, and was disappointing even under that framework.I am trying to figure out exactly where it went wrong but there are so many possible culprits that it's hard to pinpoint. I think the idea could have been intriguing if properly executed. Beyond that, everything failed. The characters were one-dimensional, the dialogue was contrived, and all of the people who were there to move along the plot were unconvincing not only in their knowledge but also how this knowledge was acquired.The random schoolteacher at the Irish Halloween celebration coincidentally held the key to finding the child after having said she knew nothing moments before? The blind homeless guy coincidentally knew about the portal to the other side? The university colleague in (literature?) knew just where to find and access the conveniently detailed historical documents in the archives that told you exactly what had happened hundreds of years ago to a random colonist? And was then killed for that knowledge? To what end? She had already revealed what she knew to Nic Cage - what could be the purpose of killing her? The cop who basically did nothing aside from serving as a foil to Cage's character and failing to pursue supposed leads for the missing children?The plot seemed disjointed and the acting was unconvincing. It was like random scenes independent of each other or the greater storyline - in particular, the psychic who was burned internally, the vultures, the spirit appearing before Halloween to the children, the children saying ""pay the ghost."" For any if this to work there would have needed to be a greater exploration into the mythology and a solid connection to present-day events. Nothing is explained and we are there left confused and underwhelmed. The possession elements of Nic Cage and his wife were just there, sans explanation or exploration.I also found myself wondering how a newly tenured professor and his (architect? Designer?) wife could afford what is likely a million-dollar brownstone in NYC.You didnt feel for the characters because they were never properly developed. Their relationships were not deeply explored. I think I liked the child actor best in this film, even though he had only a few minutes of screen time. Everyone else was disappointing.This film is not worth anyone's time, and I wish I hadn't wasted mine."
" So disappointing.
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,2,"I looked like it could be a great mystery film, sadly it's a cheap horror movie."
" Lame
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,4,"Cage has done some good things (ghost rider!) but often acts very aloof and uninterested. The story was lame, predictable and tedious. I'm pretty sure I watched this film before but forgot all about it and will probably do so again. Not a big loss if you miss this. Not completely avoidble, but there's much better stuff out there."
" Well I enjoyed it.
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,7,"Is it a classic? No. It is however a hugely enjoyable 90 minutes or so, with no dull moments, it kept my attention throughout, and I thought it was well made and well acted, one of Nicholas Cages best performances for me."
" Don't pay
",2020-02-06 00:00:00,5,"Nicholas Cage loses his 7 year old son at a Halloween street carnival in New York, a year on he discovers that it is all down to an executed 17th Century Irish witch. I like Nicholas Cage, always watchable despite appearing in some real turkeys. Now this is not a bad movie but neither is it a good one. The scariest part I thought was said scene in which he loses his son amongst the crowd of revellers, a parents' worst nightmare. The film does throw plenty of supernatural scares at the viewer but with little effect, unless you are easily scared. The ending was pretty silly too. At least the the origins of Halloween, i.e. Samhain, is discussed.
I wouldn't pay to watch this film but it it a reasonable 90 minutes of supernatural horror, a once only view in my opinion."
" Relient on flashy special effects.
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,5,"The biggest shock of this movie was seeing the quality director Uli Edel, role up in the end credits. This was such a routine horror, which was over reliant on computerized effects. The problem with C.G.I is that, as soon as the film is made they are almost already outdated. If you want to see a good horror with Nicolas Cage, check out 'Season of the Witch'."
" Suspense not violence
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,7,The best part of this movie was that it was basing the intensity of the story in suspense. Most current movies of this genre seem to be based on over the top violence. Whereas this film it is kept to the bare minimum. This is definitely in the style of the good old fashioned ghost stories
" Nicolas Cage was not made for that kind of movie
",2019-10-18 00:00:00,5,A lot of scecial effects trying to make it impressive but it's not working. The scenario is too poor and verry predictible. Nicolas Cage is not an actor made for that kind of movie. When i see his face i was expected for an unlikely gunfight with ghosts
" Good old fashioned horror film
",2019-08-19 00:00:00,9,"Totally entertaining- no blood no guts - just old fashioned horror that you can watch without cringing, I thoroughly enjoyed it! Watch it if you are not a fan of slasher horror."
" Why such low rates?
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,8,"Seriously I don't get it. An amazing movie, interesting from the first till last second. Didn't expect anything less with such an amazing cast"
" Nick Cage Must Be Stopped!
",2019-06-29 00:00:00,1,"I can't believe that anyone would give this more than one star. It was simply dreadful, from start to finish.There must be a quicker, more efficient manner to send the movies of Nicolas Cage to the trash can. Direct to DVD just isn't fast enough. There must be a better way for his movies to sink into total oblivion. This was possibly the worst movie ever filmed, and I don't throw that pejorative around freely.Alternative titles: Turd-tanic"
" Hmm
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,3,"This movie was very bland. It was very average. Nothing about this movie is a ""horror film"". I understand this movie was ""a supernatural horror film"" but for me this movie just didn't cut it. This movie does not deserve to be in the horror genre. This movie is something you put on just to fall asleep around 3 am. I do not recommend. Boring, bland, average, and just overall lacked any cinematic standards."
" Not bad enough to be funny, just painfully mediocre
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,5,"With Nicolas Cage, you never know what to get. Awesome like Face/Off, or a horrible Wicker Man. Sometimes it's neither. Nic Cage plays a father who loses his son to dark forces and loses his relationship as a result. This doesn't stop him from looking for his son.Cage isn't even so bad in this film. The worst part of this movie is just that it is hardly noticable. It's painfully average, mediocre and absolutely not compelling at any moment, The few moments that are slightly scary are generic and rip off Darkness Falls. Maybe it's a shame that this movie isn't so bad it's funny. It's just......meh."
" Nick pays the ghost, and we pay to see Nick!
",2018-12-10 00:00:00,5,"I strongly suspect that, around 2009-2010 or so, Nicolas Cage participated in a secret scientific experiment to have himself cloned, and that since then there are at least three of four Nicks walking around in Hollywood! How else would you explain the large number of Nick Cage vehicles that is getting released each year? I seems that, every time I blink my eyes, two or three titles are added to Cage's filmography here on IMDb. I don't mind, though, and it's even quite clever because I (and surely many others with me) will pretty much watch everything that Nicolas Cage stars in, regardless of the quality. And, granted, a lot of the B-type action/horror movies that he starred in lately are bad. Take ""Pay the Ghost"", for instance. I probably never would have bothered to continue watching if it weren't for Cage's name prominently decorating the opening credits, as it looks like just another derivative and predictable ghost story with a weak plot and an overload of fake scares. Make no mistake, ""Pay the Ghost"" IS a forgettable and weak supernatural horror entry, but hey, maybe I was in an exceptionally good mood because I nevertheless enjoyed it. The script is obviously trying to cash in on ""Insidious"", ""Sinister"" and every other recently released thrillers featuring ghost children, and Cage strictly acts on automatic pilot, but I was still interested in the plot of his missing son. Charlie mysteriously vanished during last year's Halloween parade and, nearly one year later, his father discovers that several children go missing every year on All Hallows Eve without ever getting found. Mike reunites with his estranged wife and together they stumble upon a harrowing tragedy that occurred nearly three centuries ago. Being a sucker for folklore/urban legend stories involving witchery and burning at the stake, I really dug the tale of Annie Sawquin, and director Uli Edel (""Christiane F."") did his best to insert a creepy atmosphere, decent special effects and eerie scenery. Certain scenes are quite brutal, like the fade of the spiritual medium, and the happy ending doesn't feel too forced. But, like I said, I was in a good mood and Cage himself probably already doesn't remember ""Pay the Ghost"" anymore."
" IT'S HERE
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,7,"The film opens with and incident in 1679 New York and jumps to the present. Mike Lawford (Nicolas Cage) is a professor of horror literature in NYC. While celebrating Halloween with his son Charlie (Jack Fulton) he suddenly goes missing with his last words being ""pay the ghost."" Mike is not convinced his son is dead, and goes on a search. The film plays out like a modified POLTERGEIST, which I though was a better movie.This would make a decent Halloween film for the kids complete with turkey vultures and a creepy blind man. Could give them nightmares with the shadow images. For seasoned horror film watchers, this is just one of a pack of ghost films, done well, but not over powering.Guide: No sex or nudity. Don't recall any swearing."
" So bad, but so funny
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,2,"Basically a typical mindnumbing paranormal ""horror"" movie which offers nothing new to the table. There are bunch of elements which seem to be just copied from other movies (Sinister, Insidious, Mama to name a few). Still, in the end it's pretty damn humorous for few factors.Nicolas Cage doesn't quite go Wicker Man on this one, but there are few moments where the classic Cageness comes through. If you happen to be familiar with the game director David Cage and despite his typical storytelling, this movie becomes that way so freaking funny since it hits so many same notes as his works it starts to feel like he himself directed it."
" Pay The Ghost most likely only paid Cage's salary.
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,3,"Y'know the feeling where you watch the first twenty minutes and think to yourself ""wow, I'm actually surprised. So far this is really decent!"", only for it to quickly decline into a predictable bore that relishes in clichès and stupidity? Yeah, this film. The disparity between the first third and the remaining two thirds can only be defined as a cosmic mess, and that really exasperates me. A father loses his child during Halloween and is soon convinced that a supernatural entity took his son and many other children. We have a self-confessed deity that steals children and brings them to their world, quite like 'Sinister'. We also have an entire third act where the father goes through a portal into another dimension in order to find his son, a lot like 'Insidious'. Put these two films together for a steamy one night stand and welcome their new child Pay The Ghost. Except this child has the power to genetically absorb all of the frightening innovative qualities of its parents and turn itself into a snoozefest. Absurdly weak jump scares that consist of a flashing image followed by a piercing noise. A plot so predictably boring and illogical that you start to question Cage's choices for roles in films. Why? He is better than this! The first act proves he still has credible talent. The emotive drama and realisation of every parent's worst nightmare captivated me. Both Cage and Callies reacted with authentic fear, you can see it in their eyes. The sheer panic that proceeded the realisation of their son going missing, again, felt authentic. Such a promising introduction, and perhaps the comeback we wanted from Cage. Heck, he made for such an endearing fatherly figure, that I myself want Cage as a father. Alas, ""one year later"" shows up and this supernatural horror slowly possessed me into taking a nap. Everyone looks bored, the script coincidentally goes missing and scenes become laughable. ""I can't sleep, can you?"", ""Yeah, I'm gonna try."". You either can sleep, and therefore don't need to try, or can't. Urgh, more recycled than a plastic bottle."
" Enjoyable movie
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,9,"I really liked this movie, great cast, great acting and different story. Watch this for sure, dont be put off by the lower scores."
" A Good Ghost Story
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,10,"I watched this with my 9 year old (who loves horror) and we both really enjoyed it. Look, it's not oscar quality but it is a really good ghost story with a satisfying end. If you are into the supernatural side of horror this might be for you."
" Why not
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,6,"It's Nicolas Cage and you know he's had his ups and downs in movies but possibly more downs. This one is in the middle. The botton line is it's always fun to see his facial expressions and dedication even to a story like this which is not that bad at all but very familiar. As a horror fan, this one feels ok at times but mostly filled with horror cliches mainly the jump scares. But that's not to say the movie didn't have it's creepy moments as there were a few nice ones that crept here and there and at one point it really reminded me of Sinister so that was a plus. Overall, it's on Netflix so why not give it a watch. The ending however was a bit laughable."
" Halloween movie
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,6,"Story is holding up but it is a Halloween movie like there are Christmas movies. I liked the connection with the vilain past of english invasion. Nicolas was acting very well, looking properly ghastly when appropriate."
" Not great.
",2018-06-14 00:00:00,5,"There's a lot of build up for nothing, worth watching but it's not an amazing film."
" Not bad, worth watching if you like supernatural horror movies
",2018-03-20 00:00:00,5,"Overall this film is okay. Its defiantly not the best supernatural horror movie I've seen but it defiantly deserves a watch. 
The plot is not anything that hasn't been done before, Nick Cages plays a father of a boy that goes missing. After a year of searching and doing his own investigation he discovers that there is an supernatural force taking children. Him and his wife fight to discover what happen to their son and try to get back.As expected with this type of movie there are a few jump scares. They are a little hit and miss. Some got me, some were massively preemptive and you knew they were coming. Some of the ""scare"" scenes felt a little bit rushed, it would have been better if they had more time to build the suspense. I think that would have made this movie a little more spine tingling. 
The crying lady character is quite sinister, when she appears in a few of the jump scare scenes she looked pretty menacing. I cant say I really liked the vultures that randomly appear. I get they are meant to be a calling card/sign of the crying lady but they feel out of place.
I particularly liked the scene when Cage finds the sea of missing children, that was quite chilling. 
The script was everything it needed to be, but again nothing special. It ticked all the right boxes for the type of film it is, it just felt like it was missing that extra bit of scare factor. Nick Cage does a good job, it almost feels like he could be at the start of getting back on track with this movie. Its not as great as the Nick Cage that was in Con Air or Gone in 60 seconds but it was defiantly a better performance that he has given in other films recently. The only thing I hate seeing is him running. He is not a runner. He looks awkward and uncomfortable and for some reason it irritates me. 
Sarah Callies plays the part of the grieving mother well. She supports Cages character nicely. I would have liked to see her be a little more involved in the story but she was good when she was on scene. Watch this film if you have an hour and half to spare and fancy watching a jump scare supernatural film. If you want to watch a great horror movie then this isn't for you, maybe watch something else."
" Nothing special
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,4,"PAY THE GHOST sees the extraordinarily hard-working Nicolas Cage having a go at the horror genre in the form of this miserable, greyed-out ghost story. He plays a somewhat bumbling teacher and father who manages to lose his kid at a carnival and goes on a quest to find him again. It soon transpires that dark supernatural forces are at work, forcing Cage to enter a kind of netherworld to retrieve his child. As with most Hollywood ghost stories, this plays out with a maximum of cheesy CGI effects used to represent ghostliness and a minimum of wit and intelligence. Cage tries hard to invest in his role but doesn't quite succeed while Sarah Wayne Callies doesn't seem to try at all as his wife. As for the scares, well, you can forget about any of them."
" A decent horror flick
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,7,"I'll go against the grain here. I think this is a fairly good horror/suspense film. Certainly better than many of the slasher type horror films that seem to come out every few months.There is a problem -- Nicholas Cage. Not that there was anything wrong with his acting (not that it's his best outing, either). But, he's (gasp) too old for the part. In his mid-50s with a kid who's about 7. And he looks so much older and flabby in the face, too. I know what you may be thinking -- why am I being so mean. I'm not. He's just too old for the part and it shows.But beyond that, the movie held my attention. And, I disagree with a number of other posters in that this is not ""the"" standard plot. Sure, there are things you kinda guess and expect along the way, but it's been a long time since I saw a unique horror film. And there are things -- particularly the ending -- that are quite different from much that I've seen before.Yes, I know it was direct to DVD, which is not a good sign. But give it a chance."
" Another Bad Day For Cage
",2017-09-28 00:00:00,4,"A professor (Nic Cage) frantically searches for his son who was abducted during a Halloween parade.""Pay the Ghost"" received negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 11%, based on 21 reviews, with a rating of 3.8/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 23 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating ""generally unfavorable reviews"".The real mystery is that this film received any positive reviews at all. The acting is terrible, just terrible. This is not one of Cage's better roles, though it actually is not his worst. And then Sarah Wayne Callies... how does she keep getting cast in movies and television? She is so awful, she ruins everything, and yet keeps coming back. Is she blackmailing someone?"
" Hey, that was quite good.
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,7,"I'm completely aware of all the hate Nicholas Cage gets (which I disagree with), however I actually consider him a good actor that commonly falls into the wrong hands. In this little horror film, Nicholas Cage actually gives an acceptable performance as the main role with good, sentimental angry outbursts of rage. It's nothing special, but I enjoyed this film because of it's imaginative, dark cinematography and quietly creepy atmosphere. It's got good jumpscares, surprisingly eye-capturing visual effects and an alright storyline to keep it going, and as long as you expect little from this film you may find yourself pleasantly surprised. I have to remark, this is actually one of Nicholas Cage's better films after all the crap he's acted in previously, and it's good that he's still acting in some films worthy of your time."
" Mediocre Horror-Thriller
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,6,"A lot of reviews are giving this movie flack but it's not that bad. I feel like people go into Cage movies now expecting the worse and have already decided how to feel about it before they've even watched it. I'm not about to argue that this film is good (because it definitely isn't) but you could do far worse than watch this movie. Sure, the CGI is terrible and the plot is no good. But we have okay dialogue in the script and everyone in the movie (minus the child actor) does a fine job. Cage isn't hamming it up like he often does and Sarah Wayne Callies does a great job. The scene after they lose their son is rather heartbreaking when you look at her. This movie does fall apart a bit down the stretch, however.All in all, it's very forgettable, not recommended, but not terrible either."
" NOTHING SPECIAL..... NOTHING UNIQUE .... NOTHING TERRORYING..... But they had Vision but no real execution.
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,5,"I ALWAYS ENTER TO WATCH A MOVIE WITH THIS MOTTO........ "" ENTER A MOVIE WITHOUT ANY HIGH EXPECTATIONS.... AT THE END OF IT BE TRULY SURPRISED AND NOT SO DISAPPOINTED EVEN THOUGH HOW BAD IT TURNED OUT TO BE....... "" BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T SET HIGH EXPECTATIONS.There is nothing special about this horror flick.A Simple Story with a little bit of scares...... The Director had Vision but no great Story or execution in making it really creepy or exciting.I Love Nicolas Cage one of my top 3 favourite actors.But in this he slowly losing his amazing acting skills and now his acting seems average to me.I DON'T REVEAL THE STORY OF ANY FILM.... I DON'T LIKE TO SPOIL THE FUN.... So here is My OVERALL RATINGSSTORY 4 / 10...... Nothing New and Special ACTING 6 / 10..... Average but not amazing , even though Nicholas Cage is in it.DIRECTION 6 / 10..... Some Scenes pulled you into the story and film... The others was OK and like no other simple horror flickHORROR 4 / 10...... Less Scares and nothing terrifying..... If your a big fan of horror movies you will be disappointed.OVERALL 5 OUT OF 10.....ON A ENDING NOTE..... IT IS WATCHABLE, BUT AVOIDABLE AT THE SAME TIME....."

",2017-01-17 00:00:00,4,"You know a movie has failed to connect when you only discover the lead character's name as the end credits roll. Apparently Nic Cage's character here was called 'Mike'. It could've been Dave, Jeff or Pete. How about Tony? And that highlights the main problem with Pay The Ghost. I know a lot of people will have invested a lot of time and effort both on and off screen to make this movie into a finished product, but no aspect of it has sticking power at all. It feels hastily cobbled together, two dimensional and - despite having more witchy wizardy occulty evil hocus pocus magic than you can shake a dead newt at - it's ultimately dull. Where's the chill factor? As other reviews have pointed out it's just so routine you can virtually describe what's about to happen around every corner.As for the police detective on the case and the shades-wearing guy in the underground cave, they were both so unconvincing it was comical. A few other characters seemed to arrive then leave for no reason. There was some blonde foreign woman investigator towards the end who was doing something or other...what was that about? To be honest I don't care.This isn't terrible but it just didn't work as either a horror or a supernatural thriller."
