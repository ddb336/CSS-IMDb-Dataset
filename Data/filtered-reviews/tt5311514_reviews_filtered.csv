" I Literally Cannot Overhype This
",2021-04-10 00:00:00,10,"Your Name is not just one of the best animated films ever made (if not the best, it easily competes with Beauty and the Beast, Spirited Away, Wall-E, etc.), it is one of the best films ever made. It is damn near perfect. This movie made me feel things I forgot I could feel.It's just so tightly written. The movie tackles so many different themes; fate, love, coming of age, tradition's place in modernity, rural and urban divides, and even the legacy of Japan's nuclear fallouts, but despite the fact the movie only clocks in at a little above 90 minutes, it does each theme so well. Plus, it develops its themes through pitch perfect human characters and one of the most succinct, affecting plots I have ever seen.The animation, of course, is also crazy beautiful. There is nothing else quite like it. The richness of the visual information onscreen, the insane little details, the seamless combination of buttery-smooth CGI motion and hand-drawn animation, the lighting so good you'd think it was real, combines to create animation beautiful enough to move you even without the film's overwhelming, gorgeous catharsis.My advice, watch it twice. It was great on the first watch and absolutely blew me away on the second rewatch."
" Best anime movie
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,10,It is litrally the best story they could gave in a anime movie it has the classy anime vibes and the ending might be quit easy but itz the best they could done in a movie.
" One of best of the best
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,10,"I can't put it in words how good Your Name is. I laughed, I cried and yeah I mostly cried. The animation is so beautiful along with a hearthbreaking and extraordinary story. Never seen anything like this! This film is one of the reasons why I can't take the academy seriously, not even an Oscar nomination. One of the best animated films of all time."
" FASCINATING MOVIE
",2021-04-08 00:00:00,9,"After a long time i have seen a movie like this . Salute to the imagination of writer and wonderful direction of director . This movie is about a girl mitsuha , who lives in small town and a boy taki , who lives in tokyo . Their lives changes when they wake up and switching places with each other. It is a sweet combo of fantasy , slice of life and time traveling."
" Not bad but Not Great either
",2021-04-08 00:00:00,1,"First of all, I would give it a 6 but I gave it 1 to counter all those ratings.Now, I was really hyped for this movie. Seeing wallpapers here and their, watching the trailer, I developed heaven level expectations for this film. But when I actually watched it, it dint please me. The music was excellent and the animation was really detailed and colorful. But I found the screenwriting really, really bad. It had a great concept, but the dialogues were so unsatisfying. They didn't do much to make the movie enjoyable or progress smoothly and the way the story advanced was off. People praise the pacing but I had a lot of troubles with it. For instance getting adjusted to their new life was compressed into a song when it was the most fun part, when it should have been given more time. And like half of the movie went to saving the town which was boring and predictable. Many people like it so they must have something to like it. But I just couldn't enjoy it. It would not make it into a list of my top twenty fav anime films. At least I still listen to the music."
" Okay number 1
",2021-04-08 00:00:00,10,Amazing story I really love this movie.It a must to watch that's my very first japanese romance love story anime and now it makes me want to explore for more.
" Beautiful and original story!
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,9,"An absorbing, original, moving story. The juxtaposition of locations brought to life beautifully in the animation."
" An attempt at a spoiler-free recommendation of ""Your name""
",2021-04-06 00:00:00,10,"""Your name"" is the best movie I have ever seen, yet saying WHY everyone should watch it is incredibly hard without either spoiling things or focussing on overly specific details. You should watch this movie for the first time while knowing as little about it as possible. Imagine watching ""Ender's game"" after already knowing how it ends. This movie has about three or four such shocking moments (but in different ways) and much more that is best experienced exactly as the creator intended.I will try to say as much as I can anyway: This movie contains strong emotions, action, humour, mystery, fantasy, character development, music, etc., but more than in any other movie I have ever seen, these elements are all strongly connected with each other and with the plot. Just the premise alone already contains multiple factors that I would have never thought about combining, but it is apparently exactly what was needed to create such a masterpiece.It is visually incredibly beautiful, every tiniest scene was created with amazing attention to detail. The way the virtual camera moves must have been very difficult to create, but definitely pays off. Where other animated movies would only draw a simple background and 2-3 frames of mouth movement whenever someone speaks, here you get beautiful backgrounds and lots of moving pieces. There are 24 frames per second and most of the time either 8 or 12 of them are individually drawn, but then parts are cleverly combined and moved in relation to each other to make it even smoother. I am not as easily impressed by images as with music or film, but when I carefully looked through the movie and picked out my favourite frames, I ended up with hundreds of them.Speaking about music, the soundtrack is also beautiful and fits the movie extremely well, especially the lyrics of the four non-instrumental tracks. Just hearing the first second of any of them brings tears to my eyes every time.It also doesn't end with just watching the movie once: After watching it multiple times, reading the novel version of it and the lyrics of the soundtrack, researching about specific details and deeper meanings and thinking about it a lot, I appreciate the movie even more. In my view it went from ""one of the best movies ever"" to ""nothing is even comparable to it"", the more I knew about it.Finally, a little warning: You should carefully choose WHEN to watch this movie. Don't expect to be able to get anything done while watching it. And some people have reported various effects on them for days afterwards, ranging from a feeling of emptiness, as if nothing in their lives will ever be as good or profound as this, to intense happiness, appreciating life more or even having a therapeutic effect. In my case, it was that I couldn't focus on anything else for a long time afterwards and kept thinking about the movie all the time. But it has also inspired me to create some little things of my own and there are definitely worse things that could get stuck in your head."
" Review for the movie

" Just WOW!!!
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,10,"Even if you're not a fan of anime, you are just gonna be amazed how good this really is.Please hollywood never try to remake this masterpice."
" Better than most hollywood productions but not without any errors
",2021-03-25 00:00:00,8,"This movie is amazing. The plot may have been inspired here and there but it's something completely new in it's entirety. The scenery and art style is very dreamy and make me wanna go to japan. Also the soundtrack is very fitting and adds to the atmosphere although some people might be annoyed by the japanese singing, but it's a japanease movie playing in japan so what are you expecting? There might be some logical holes that make you think like: ""Hm, why didn't they just do this instead? That would've been much easier"" but it's nothing major so if you aren't even paying close attention to the story, you might even notice. Another problem with this movie is thar there are many time-lapses which probably explains why many of the bad critics are complaining about the sudden romace between the characters. It didn't quite come clear when and how they fell in love due to the shortness of the movie and the timelapses where they probably got closer. Without these negative critic points I'd rate it 10/10. All in all it is a great romantic movie with a twist that is very emotional and hypnotizes with its atmosphere that is created by the lovely and detailed art style and the music. You can't watch this movie coldhearted and with a negative attitude towards japanese animations or you'll miss out on its magic. Thank you for reading!"
" I broke down after watching this movie😭
",2021-03-25 00:00:00,9,"I Have not cried since the last 5,6 years but this movie made me cry 😭..this is a masterpiece with amazing story telling, engaging direction and most importantly the hindi dubbed version I watched was so amazing.

" I bought this on BR
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,9,"After watching it once I had to own it and also have the extras. Great film.
This film has a nice story, originality, amazing graphics, the girl is slender and pretty and the world-making is top-notch.
As for the American remake in Chicago: I rather watch Donald's home video making love to Ivanka than ever watch that. What is wrong with Hollywood???"
" Beautiful
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,8,"Review By Kamal KStory
The story is fairly straightforward; It's very easy to guess where the story will head, but that doesn't mean to say I didn't enjoy it. I felt a lack of emotional depth from the characters. This lacking depth makes me constantly question the characters' actions throughout the film, and because I am constantly searching for a motivation for their actions besides purely as plot devices, I am effectively removed from the immersion.Art
As expected of a Makoto Shinkai film, the artwork is beautiful. The production quality is off the charts. The art in itself is enough to evoke tears. His choice of colors and use of movement and focus within the frame really help you pay attention to what you need to pay attention to, while also not skimping out and leaving out detail if your eyes do decide to stray, which I recommend you do while watching any Makoto Shinkai film.Character
I wouldn't say I have much of a complaint about main characters Taki and Mitsuha. We all can relate to the high school phase of our lives, it appeals to us because stories we read or watch in books or films set on characters that are going through this remind us of our own springtime of youth. Shinkai did a good job at portraying them and their relationships. My main gripe is that I feel they weren't explored enough to feel a strong sense of emotional attachment. Their lives, personalities, traits, habits, friends, lifestyles, etc are all explored in the first actually swim around in this world of possibilities. I wanted to laugh, cry, and even relate more with the characters, but I felt that I only read about them in a story, or saw them in a film (which I did).
20 minutes, I personally felt that we only skimmed the surface of these characters and are forced to go further into the shallow end of a pool, only hoping that it gets deeper to actually swim.Enjoyment
As someone who is not big on the school/ drama genres, I was a bit hesitant to give this movie a shot. However, the school tag is not so relevant and aside from the main characters being in school/ around it; it has no huge implications to the story. As for drama, the family ties each character had, to their respective families, played a huge part in getting the viewer invested. I found myself feeling both happy and sad whenever a character was being pelted with bad news/ going through tough times. I also enjoyed all the small chit-chat and conversations Mitsuha had with her sister or grandmother."
" A good romantic movie.
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,10,First time Anime experience and I have to say that not a bad one. It's really a good romantic movie with emotional and a little comedy.
" Beautiful
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,10,"I watched this last night with my sister (who has a strong dislike for anime), and my cousin. After it finished, I asked my sister what she thought of it, and she said it was a solid 10/10.Personally I think it was a 9.5/10, the scenery was beautiful, I loved the story, but I think it should've spent just a little more time developing the characters."
" A Re-watcher
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,8,"This was amazing. I enjoyed the story and the realism of the amazing graphics.
I am sure I missed a couple of things and will definitely re-watch shortly, but would have anyway even if I had understood everything.
I like the fans service, the pretty co-worker and the adults' reaction. I read that there is an American remake coming and is set in, get this, Chicago. So cringe."
" An imprinted movie ever
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,10,"The story is fancy and modern. I like the plot that the boy from the city and the girl from the rural town are switching the bodies. I like how they show their culture in 2 side (countryside & city). The scene in the movie is very beautiful.
Especially when the comet is separating itself. Some place is used from the real one such as Shinjuku, Shinano-machi station pedestrian bridge and Yotsuya Station. The movie soundtracks of this movie are really good too. That are sung by the Japanese rock band name Radwimps. I can listen the playlist of these songs for month!"
" Beautiful and mesmerizing animation
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,10,"This is the second Makoto Shinkai movie that i have seen. The first one i saw was 5 Centimeters per second. Since then i have started following his work.
Your name is a Japanese animated romantic fantasy film. It is the story about a high school boy who study in Tokyo and a girl from the countryside who accidently and inexplicably swap their bodies.
Starting from the story part Overall, the narrative is well organized. The events narrated that are not confusing. The length of the content is not too long and it was cleaver, how the director make a emotional scene with the character. There are many impressive scenes. The story showing difference about people who live in the city and people who live in countryside, Local tradition, including the use of supernatural events, make the story more interesting.
As for the animation work, the work shown are meticulous in making. Show the intention of the creator. In some scenes of the movie the images that projected make the feeling of being in that real place. The facial expressions and gestures of the characters also performed naturally.
The soundtrack used in the movie and the tempo of the song are perfectly and feels good. There are many scenes that make me feel impressed and amenable to the emotions of the characters in the movie.
My feeling after watching this movie, the movie has a variety of feeling and with all the elements in the movie, this is the first movie that gives me the most emotion. This is the movie that even if you come back to watch it again, it will never get bored and always retrace your first feeling when you watching it first time."
" It's utterly gorgeous to watch
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,10,"An absolutely stunning film!There is nothing to even marginally dislike about 'Your Name'. The animation is sensational, breathtaking in fact. The amount of detail, particularly in Tokyo, is insane. It's utterly gorgeous to watch.Then you have the magnificent story, which is filled to the brim with feeling and meaning. I felt everything that it intended me to. It's also paced to perfection and is told through two memorable characters in Taki (Ryunosuke Kamiki) and Mitsuha (Mone Kamishiraishi).Kamiki and Kamishiraishi are excellent in the lead roles. Of course I don't understand Japanese and was using subtitles, yet I still felt every intended emotion from those two. Class from them. Of the others, Ms. Okudera (Masami Nagasawa) is the one that sticks out most to me.If all that wasn't enough, you even have a tremendous soundtrack and score to boot. It really does all make for a fantastic viewing experience, one I will be revisiting no doubt and one I would undoubtedly recommend."
" Awesome realistic effects
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,10,"Well done Comix Wave film. 👋👋👋💓
This deserves Oscar...but Disney movies got Oscar every year (Nepotism)"
" Must watch once in lifetime
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,8,"Your Name is one of the most memorable animation movie I've seen. First of all, the scenes in this movie is really stunning. I really appreciate with the quality of artwork in this movie whether it is place in that scene or characters. And the song, I really love the opening song from RADWIMPS. The melody is really touch when it was play along the movie. Another part that is the most important in this movie is the plot! At first I hadn't read any movie spoil so I didn't expect what the plot will be. The movie is becoming plot twist several time but it can narrate the story beautifully. I really recommend this movie to everyone, this is the movie that you have to watch once in your life!!"
" Movies worth seeing Try it!
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,10,"The characters in the film have a wide variety of characters, and each has its own role to keep the movie going, with two main characters, both lively and charming to follow. Especially the heroine, the first part of the movie tells the story from the main heroine's point of view. And then change to the hero's perspective in the latter where the story begins to turn intense Make the male lead role like the representative of the audience searching for the truth. And inviting them to appease. The director chose the plot as a switch between male and female bodies, which is a very common plot, but the director was able to make it more special than any other movie. You can use a variety of elements such as The hidden clues in each stage of the story, everything is solved, the end of the story, everything has its own story, he can tell it well, or will it be a different location for the main character to The media shows that when an individual is in another situation that is completely different from what we are used to, how does it make us feel, or is it to adapt different cultures and present them up to date? People are easy to understand. And they understand the reason why they have to inherit the culture very well. And in the setting part is the work of Makoto Shinkai, who is the man who made the pictures, the palace is very magnificent, which is another story that he has released as a visual work of this story based on various locations in Japan. It's a movie worth wasting 2 hours watching a movie. If you want to find a movie to watch for a certain feeling, this is the movie you should watch. But if you want to watch a movie to relax and relax, don't watch it because this story will make you cry. But if I give you advice, try it, and you'll feel that it's really worth your time."
" You need to see this...
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,9,"Kimi no na wa (Your Name) is by far the most transcendent piece of animation I have ever seen. Every frame of this animation is stunning and reminds me of a painting in every shot. The storytelling also advances far beyond the Western love generalisation and moves far beyond a sexual or ""meant to be"" cliche connoted from this and in to a beautiful spiritual bond that needs to be witnessed in order to fully appreciate the meticulous and intricate love that was put into this film to create this sense."
" Doesn't have a good ending. They lost memories of each other.
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,6,"The characters have never actually spend time with each other, they also lost memories of each other. I didn't liked it. I found a comment that it would have been better if they retained their memories."
" Good but I never seen them spending time with each other.
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,6,"Well the movie was great so I give it 8 stars based on its quality but if I liked it or not? Well I never like movies, I love series. Series can explore characters life more than movies. I am not satisfied with this movie because I never seen them spend time together. Dont expect to see them spending good times with each other. The movie ended by both characters asking each other's name. I thing more is that they don't even remember each other completely. How come they forget each other's name is their memory so weak."
" Best animation that has ever made!
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,10,"Your name is a stunning outstanding animation that has ever been shown on the screen. I am not only talk about only the story but also animation quality, music, and voice actor. I suggested to read the plot of the story before going to watch the animation. I guarantee that it will not spoil the overall story of the movie, just to be able to know a little detail about main characters and understand what is going to happen in the movie.For those who saw my article and want to know little about this animation, I will write down a story plot here. The story is about Taki and Mitsuha. They are a high school student that live in different town in Japan. Taki is a boy who live in an urban area in Tokyo with his father. He works part-time in an Italian restaurant and wish to become an architect. One night he has a very weird dream where he become a high school girl, who live in a small in the countryside of Japan. Mitsuha is a girl from a small town with her sister and grandmother. She sticks of living in a boring town and has a dream of living in Tokyo.
I have a lot of feelings to express after I have watched Your name. And I do not really know where to start with, as everything in this movie was very perfect. I think I am going to start with the director "" Makoto Shinkai "" he was well known as an artist who made a lot of high-quality animation. Not only this movie but every of his previous films were stunning and brilliant for both story and animation. Whether you like or dislike his previous films, but you will in live with Your name without any doubt. The animation was something that you will never get from other anime. Every place in the movie were illustrated exactly like the real world like lighting, building, landscape, and people. And it makes me feel like I was standing in the location where the main characters were. The voice actors were very great and talent. They can express characters emotion excellently, even only the voice we will be able to understand their feelings without seeing it. Lastly was the music and soundtrack, it was performed by RADWIMPS which is one of the greatest artists in Japan. And that can guarantee the quality of it without explaining. It was very memorable, a lot of people still listening to it even the movie was released 4 years ago. The movie ended happily for both characters, so no need to worry about bad end, as some of you might experience it before on one of Makoto's film.
Overall, the movie was excellent in many ways and you will not be disappointed at all. It will reach your expectation and even above. So, I suggest finding one and start watching I assure you will not regret it."
" Amazing Animation; Ok story
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,7,"This Animation Was Spectacular! I Would say five of the stars Belong just to the animation itself! That's How Reedeming it is, however the story Was ok. I mean I don't really get why it was such a Beloved Anime to Many people. And the funny thing is I'm a HUGE Drama Anime type of guy and this was Kinda a Let down. I mean, in one part of the movie, for the main charecter to go back In time to save a girl from death, He has to Drink aged Milk that was Spit out for Many years -_-. Other than some plot issues, It was overall a decent enough anime and the Ending Was actually quite a Reedeming factor also! But overall it was ok"
" Suggest me some adjectives to praise this film!
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,10,"It hasn't been so much time since I started watching anime movies. I used to think that cartoons are just for kids. I have had some primitive and conservative thoughts that they are fools who get involved in cartoons. But I found out that I was wrong only after watching the movie Inside Out. Since then, I have tasted a few dozen anime films. But I had never seen a movie like Your Name.
The concept of the film is amazing. The film manages to entertain as well as inform. The story is extraordinary. This is a visual treat for the eyes. The film is more than perfect in emotion, story, character development, camera work and visuals. Though i want to praise this film I'm out of word."
" Beautiful
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,10,"Words can't describe how beautiful the movie...
Its just a very bizzare emotional feeling , everytime i watch this movie...How can a movie be so perfect and beautiful ?
Makoto shinkai has done phenomenal job on this one."
" Phenomenal film.
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,9,"Your Name, is an uplifting, emotional, and beautiful film that leaves the audience satisfied with a powerful ending. The bond that the two main characters created was hard to believe at first but then grew into something that meant so much more than what they were externally dealing with in the story (vague to avoid spoilers). Also, The animation is this film was very aesthetically pleasing with the vibrant colors and the beautiful scenery and attention to detail. Another thing that blew me away was the powerful soundtrack with it's fitting and heartwarming themes. The ending of this film is one of the most satisfying endings I have seen in anything in a while. All in all, Your Name, is an immensely satisfying and emotional film that leaves the audience walking out with a smile on their face."
" Heartwarming and surprising
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,8,Me and simeon cheered when they turned around at the end.
" Best animated feature I have ever seen!
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,10,I highly recommend this to anyone who loves the medium of animation as the animation in this movie is just stunning and jaw-dropping. The story is unique as i have never seen a story executed the way it has in this movie. This anime is also not only for adults but for children as well...it starts out comedic then it turns into an emotional roller coaster...I cried three times during this movie lol.
" Puzzling
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,8,I have many question about this very moving. But the one that went through my mind the most is...Why would you make so many door shots?
" l really can't got the point of this movie
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,7,"It made me have a doubt beacause l don't kown why they fell in love.but l love this director's other work.emm,maybe it my fault? l love 5 Centimeters per Second .."
" Beautiful!
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,8,"I love how beautiful the animation looks. The back drop of the city or the country side. It's just awesome! There's a lot to love about this film. It has a very engaging story. About two young people that swap body's and are trying to find each other. You get to see a lot of the culture in Japan and it's just wonderful.
The only complaint that I have is at times it just fills a little to drawn out. Not saying it's boring just not really my thing. But there's a lot of heart in this movie/anime has to offer and I agree with a lot of the praise reviews. I'm sure most people that choose to watch this film won't be disappointed."

" TRUST ME
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,9,"Watch this one many times and I've never written a review. I think the reason is because i thought 'meh it's probably got hundreds of thousands of reviews saying how good it is. But looking at the reviews I'm seeing 1,2 and 3 star reviews and these reviews aren't doing it justice. PLEASE JUST WATCH IT!"
" Help

" Mildly interesting.
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,5,I do not understand the high ratings on here. The story is somewhat nice but pretty shallow. I watched it expecting a sci fi story instead got a chick flick.

" Maybe the best music in an anime
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,10,This is movie is astoundingly best in case of music composition. The Radwimps band have forged some masterpiece for this movie. The music and background sfx all add to the scenes of the movie. It's blended so perfect that without this level of music and composition this movie would have been average. For me this particular thing made it one in a million.

Truly marvelous..."
" Fantastic movie for fans of the genre
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,9,"Not much of a fan of romance movies but this one was really heartwarming. The visuals were beautiful, voice acting phenomenal and relationships developed extremely well. The real benefit of this movie is it's plot twist.
The movie drags you in by it's unique plot, the switching of bodies between two strangers. The story is unique enough to create interest but not to crazy to cause disinterest. However, after the relationships were developed, the two main characters were familiar enough with each other to start to really become friends the switching stops. Upset, the main male protagonist seeks her out. Only to find that she was killed in an asteroid attack 3 years earlier. That plot twist hits you like a sack of bricks, you begin to think back on the last half of the movie and realize all the little additions that hint at the twist.The story was well out together, the relationships were realistic and the ending leads to a possible happy ending.heavily recommend."
" An amazing movie

Last night, New year's eve, i decided to watch it.. And waht a waste if time it was.
The script is so superficial and boring.. I mean what is the idea here? Soul mates? No.. Time travel? Don't think so.. Romance? Drama? Sci-fi?? What was that?? Don't even know where is the twist or the story.. Maybe i didn't get it.. Anyway.. 2020 was a catastrophic year in all levels.. Can't expect more.. Great way to say good bye. :)"

" BEST ANIME !
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,10,"It was at first a bit confusing but then it all comes together beautifully! This movie teaches us that time is relative and fate sometimes can t be changed but this anime meets the line between happy dreams and happy endings ! I loved it and it made me so emotional seeing that Taki didn t write his name on her hand, but said more than enough to keep her going and saving everybody else. LOVED IT! The true definition of love is not measured in time spent with your half, but sharing the same dreams is!"
" Beautiful
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,8,"People debate between if this movie is better or a silent voice is...
I personally preferred a silent voice but this movie makes a really close number 2. Its good the story is awesome and really original, and the turnaround is really unexpected.
You should go and watch it."
" Beautiful animation weaved with a very human story
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,10,"Your name was one of the biggest Japanese animation movies to come out in the last decade. I am a huge fan of anime but I never really bothered to watch your name despite all the hype because of other commitments. The premise of the movie is ""Two teenagers share a profound, magical connection upon discovering they are swapping bodies. But things become even more complicated when the boy and girl decide to meet in person"". I finally decided to watch this movie and wanted to see if this movie was deserving of its hype.Firstly, the animation and art style is so beautiful. Every shot in this movie is visually striking and it is very clear that the director (Makoto Shinkai) and his team were thorough in the detail of Tokyo and the rural countryside. The setting of this movie is based on the real world but it is so gorgeous to look at, that it feels magical. Every little thing in this movie is just so visually pleasing from the skyscrapers to the forest to just the characters eating; it's stunning. This movie was definitely robbed by the Oscar for not even nominating the movie.The music is also done by a Japanese band call ""Radwimps"" and it is phenomenal. Their songs are perfectly utilised in the movie and perfectly represents and elevate the emotion of the scene. It's surprising because using vocal pop songs are usually jarring but Your Name does it in such an effective way that the scene wouldn't feel the same without it.The story within this movie sounds cliche with the body-swapping but the way it is executed is so fundamentally different from anything Hollywoods done that it feels unique. Mitsuha is the girl who lives in the rural countryside and is a shrine maiden but wishes to live in Tokyo. Taki is the boy who lives in Tokyo who is a talented artist aspiring to be an architect. They both end up randomly swapping bodies which results in them having to discover why this is happening but also learning about each other along the way. The situation leads to them dealing with each other problems but also discovering more about themselves. Mitsuha and Taki wouldn't interact normally but this event leads to them creating a bond where they both would be irreplaceable to one another.Romance movies are not something I am fond of but Your Name kept me emotionally invested in what was going on. There is some laugh out loud moments that are expected of body-swapping but there are some serious, suspenseful and even genuinely heartwarming moments that tug at my heartstrings. The director masterfully inserts these clashing tones and makes it fit together to complement each other. There are some twist and unconventional ways to body-swapping done in this movie that sets it apart from other romance or body-swapping movies. On top of that, the characters are absolutely loveable with their quirky personalities. There is also supporting characters who are the friends of Mitsuha and Taki who are just the best people in the world.Overall, the movie is such a wild rollercoaster of emotions. There were so many moments where I was screaming internally because I was so invested in these characters and their situation. The constant message of searching for something or someone is the theme of the movie and it shouldn't resonate but it does. All of this leads to a satisfying finale that by the end I've felt rewarded. I've never been so engaged in a romance movie until Your Name. The fantastically beautiful animation that is weaved together with a very human story with likeable characters leads to what may be the best animation movie in the last decade. This was a sensational experience that everyone should experience themselves."
" Now this was a great introduction to anime
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,8,"Your Love is a stunningly beautiful story, both visually and narratively."
" Body swap AND time travel?
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,4,"It just doesn't work and makes the whole film non-sensical and full of holes. Like, they never check a date even once a day in Japan?Overall beautifully animated, but the story is just junk unless one unscrews their brain..."

" My favourite anime
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,9,Beautiful love/fantasy/time travel story that covers the emotions of falling in love for someone even if you haven't actually met. The feeling that someone out there loves you. Wonderful animation. Romance and comedy are well balanced. Soundtrack is very catchy. Not only my favourite film from director Makoto Shinkai but also my favourite anime film of all time.
" A Masterpiece!
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,10,"This is probably the best cinema I have ever seen. Perfect all around. Story, cast, visuals, humor, music, score and message. Everything was perfect."
" Mind-blowing
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,10,"This ones an awesome plot of a story. I didn't get bored watching this and it makes me excited to know what will happen next to these two people trying to find each other. I did cried at the end of the story on how it turns it out, Good job!"
" I just love scenery
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,10,"I am a bit too generous with this 10/10 approach. so, don't expect too much from my review. 10/10 means, i liked it. That's all.Now, a bit unnecessary elaboration.The part of the movie I liked most was the world building. The images of a moderate, generic Japanese town, and the calm life style, are the parts that caught my mind. :) Such features........ mountain, lake , hill side life and a bit of Tokyo here and there...I also liked the part where the environment itself becomes very crucial for the story. You can buy a beautiful doll, but talking to a beautiful girl is more challenging and the experience worth much much more , by a very long shot. You can just draw a normal average town, but to make it interact the main story itself........ that's something precious. Bring a whole lot more flavour to the dish.The story may take a little time to be understood fully, but it felt like flowing water. No laziness, it keeps flowing .... feels like sitting in a small fountain in a hot summer day. Yes, the story is that refreshing.I forgot the names of the two main characters. It's been a few week after I have watched this movie. I forgot their name and I didn't even bother looking up in google. What's the rush? besides, they didn't even knew each other's name, and they were in the movie.. :vWhat was it, again?? Their name..??"
" There is no word to explain how much I impressed after watching this MASTERPIECE!
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,10,"This is definitely a MASTERPIECE!!

This is one of those animated movie that deeply influence on my heart... I'm really jealous for those who want watch this great anime for the first time!! This is definitely one of those movies that you must watch before you die!!!"

" Incredibly vivid, original and beautiful
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,10,"This is not normally a movie or anime that would fit my taste of genres. However upon recommendation from social media I decided to give this a whirl.Absolutely mind blowing the level of detail the animators have poured into this masterpiece. I honestly paused a few scenes just to admire the dedication the animators did to cross every t and dot every i. The story itself is original and captivating which had me stuck on my seat. The voice actors also need to take a bow because I genuinely felt myself immersed in the timeline of events and importantly, feeling what the characters were experiencing emotionally too.Ask yourself, when was the last movie you watched where all your expectations were blown out the water because this is what 'Your Name' did to me and many others."
" I Love it!
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,9,"An incredible trip! The characters, the story are very captivating."
" Its Beautiful!!!
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,9,"From start till end what movie offers you is nothing but a wonder journey of two people. A love story beyond imagination.
Animation is top class, the scenes with comets are truly breath taking.
A must watch even if you are not into anime. This movie will make your day."
" Emotional Anime Film
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,8,This movie used beautiful music and striking animation to create deep emotion throughout the movie. The story is unique and keeps the viewer intrigued throughout.
" Emotional rollercoaster
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,10,"I've never watched a movie that made me tear up this much everything from the scenery to the music is sooo freaking good, If you haven't already seen this movie then definitely should cause words aren't enough to describe how good it is."
" Surprisingly good!
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,6,Your Name isn't the kind of Anime I usually watch. I have always been into the more violent Anime movies most of which are from the 80s and 90s like (Akira). I came across Your Name while scrolling through Netflix looking for something calming to watch. I am glad I gave this movie a chance because after a bit of rocky start the story picked up and it ended up catching my interest the rest of way through.Your Name tells the story of two high-school students. The first is a girl named Mitsuha who lives in a quiet mountain town. Mitsuha dreams of one day leaving her quiet boring town and moving to Tokyo where she can explore and eat at all the best Cafés. The second is boy named Taki who lives in Tokyo he works at a restaurant part time after school he dreams of one day becoming an architect. One morning they wake up inside each others bodies with no explanation to how or why it happened but they soon discover that it's not just some crazy dream and that it will keep on happening so they decide to make some rules to stop them both causing trouble in each others lives until they find a way to stop it once and for all.The first thirty minutes or so of the movie aren't very interesting or original if your an older viewer the first thirty minutes of the movie can end up coming across as just another typical high-school romance anime with fan service at least that was my initial assessment of the movie. Then to my surprise the story picked up and suddenly went from what I thought was going to be a predictable storyline to one that ended up changing my opinion of the entire movie. There's really not a whole lot you can say about the movies storyline without spoiling it but what I will say is that the movie does have some genuinely heart warming moments of friendship and romance.The animation style is breathtaking with scenes that use a unique blending of colours to create something that's beautiful to look at throughout the entire movie.The English voice acting is surprisingly good the voices match the characters well and the ADR work is very well done. The original Japanese audio always sounds better so I recommend watching it with the Japanese audio and English subtitles for the best experience.I recommend giving Your Name a chance it's a surprisingly good anime movie that appeals to both an older generation of anime fans and a new generation.
" The best......

" Kimi no na wa

" The animation!
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,8,"Well I have to start with saying that the animation is just absolutely stunning. The details, the places and characters. It all looks so good. It just amazed me in some kind of way. (My favorite was the buildings and the scenery).
The music was pretty awesome too, but the one from ""Howl's Moving Castle"" has found the place in my heart.
Well the story was definently interesting. I really liked the idea but it was hard for me to follow it through all the time. Some things just seemed to unreal and I am not a big fan of fantasy. At the end though it all made sense so that's important.
Characters were different from each other. Which I really liked and enjoyed. Not only in the looks but also in the personalities. The real friends who are always there for you and your crazy ideas. The difficult family situations.
The traditions that was amazing. Loved how the culture was resembled in this animated movie.
At the end I can say it was a very pleasant movie experience in different ways and I would totally reccomend it , even if you just want or need some twist in your movie routine."
" Great twist!!

" The Movie How I Got Interested in Anime.
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"When people were talking about anime, I had no interest in it. This movie clearly turned the tables. After watching the whole thing, I realized I was wrong about anime. It helped me got the interest in watching anime. If I didn't, my life would be empty. It had shown me strong feelings and emotions. Up until this day, this is one of my favorite anime films."
" As Deep as the Mariana Trench...
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,8,"... and as intricately woven from an abstract and mysterious loom. Using spectacular animation to draw in the viewer and steal their attention this story of finding love, of finding it in yourself and others, may well have you occasionally scratching your head. Don't worry, you're not alone, but there are plenty of resources online that can help you recompile what you've just consumed in order to make more sense of this beautiful, enchanting and imaginative Japanese composition."
" This Film is Espetacular.
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,10,"This is not a regular love story or a love story at all, this film was simply espetacular in so many levels. Characters are so amazing, the story... Oh, god, the story. To whomever is reading this, do yourself a favor and watch this film."

" Does not have enough words
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,9,"Great script, great romance, great soundtrack.
All that in one is hard to find which is exactly what we have in ""Your Name""
Must watch."
" An Out Of Body Experience, Literally
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,10,"""I feel like I'm always searching for someone, or something."" Haven't we all felt that at some point in our lives? Growing up, Japan dominated the animated film industry with masterpieces such as ""Spirited Away,"" ""Princess Mononoke,"" and ""Howls Moving Castle,"" all being directed by none other than the legendary director, Hayao Miyazaki. Since his retirement, no other Japanese animated film has never peaked near his standards, with most of them being usually mediocre. Not until 2016, when Japan's ""Your Name"" made headlines due to its astounding success in its native country. The film had gain lots of attention from the western world, with many (including critics) believing that the Film ""Your Name"" had stood on the precipice of becoming a global sensation. From my personal experience, after watching the film, I can assure you that this is an animated film like no other. With the blend of its beautiful animations and complex storyline, the movie made me wish I could literally erase my memory and watch it again.""Your Name,"" a 2d animated film directed by Makoto Shinkai, deals with the ties people have, the effects custom and tradition have on people, and how time weaves everything together. The movie is heavily influenced by an Asian myth called ""The Red Thread"" or ""String of Fate."" The belief goes that two people connected by this thread are destined to be together no matter what time, place, or circumstance. This is the main concept that the film expands upon. Adding on to that, the film presents the idea of a greater power of tying things together called ""Musubi."" Weaving threads is Musubi, people sharing bonds and relationships is Musubi, and the literal flow of time is Musubi.Now because this film is obviously a masterpiece, I'm not going to spoil the whole movie for you, but I will go just enough to say that this is a film that does answer most questions that arises in the mind of viewers, but just not in the way you might think. While watching the film, you may get some semblance of an explanation for the body-swapping between the two main characters Taki and Mitsuha, but less of who or what is causing it and more of an answer to the problem that the swapping was meant to solve. There is a lot of that with this film, particularly, and it is masterful in the way it answers your questions, and it placates you for those it chooses to avoid. Some other films might just have some magic be the cause of things occurring because reasons and the plot to be a string of coincidences, but ""your name"" avoids the coincidences entirely and gives you just enough so that it can focus far more on being a tale of fate. Overall, this tale of fate can be exposited more with the theme of the red string of fate that ties the two main characters together.Overall, I believe Makoto Shinkai nailed this film all with nice touches. The little, tiny things with the narrative and how the characters act or react on their own seem small and insignificant but overall help flesh out everyone's development far more than he's ever done compared to his past films. For example, the little messages that the two main characters send to each other's notes or reminders on their phone on the diary app while being swapped in each other's bodies seemed small and insignificant at first. Over time, the character development between the two occurs as both of each other start caring for one another even though they have never met. Because of this, ""Your Name"" is, without a doubt in my mind, the best film Makoto Shinkai has made or even more the best-animated film ever made. This story does so much more than tell you a tale of relatable characters; instead, juxtaposes so many elements, male and female, city and country, spirituality and science, present and future, all in under just two hours. It is both an epic sci-fi adventure and a heartwarming romance wrapped in such an artistic fashion that is second to none."

" Forget about E.T. and Elliot biking in front of the moon..
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,10,"If you had asked me a while back what the most magical moment in movie history was, I would say Elliot riding his bicycle with E.T. in the basket flying in front of the moon. But after watching ""Your Name"" everything changed.Mitsuha and Taki meeting for the second/first time atop the mountain at twilight immediately became not only the most magical moment in movie history in my opinion, but also the most romantic and emotional moment too.
Just when you give up all hope of Mitsuha's village being saved, Just as both protagonists give up all hope of succeeding and ever seeing each other, Mitsuha/Taki turns and looks to the setting sun and realizes twilight is upon them. He/She throws his head down and shuts his eyes. With the faintest bit of hope he looks up to see that the three years between them have been dissolved and he is know facing the girl he loves.Best. Moment. Ever."

" Heartbreaking and Heartwarming
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,8,"Your Name follows two teenagers; Mitsuha and Taki. Mitsuha lives in the mountains, in a small town in rural Japan, with dreams to move away and embrace city life. Taki lives in Tokyo in the hustle and bustle that comes with, ignorant of many old Japanese traditions. One day they wake up in each others bodies. The first act of the movie goes the way you'd expect a typical body-swap story to go. They explore each other's new forms, mess with their lives a little bit, and discover what it's like to escape their existence and live as someone else. Every night they swap back and have to deal with the fallout of the previous day, discovering as much about themselves as they do each other. But then the second act hits us with a gut-wrenching twist that shakes up the whole movie. For me, expecting a sentimental, but otherwise straight-forward teen romance, this moment flipped the movie on its head entirely. It transforms into something completely different, as we follow Taki desperately trying to cling to the person he became in his dreams, battling the gradual loss of memory that all dreams suffer from. It drives him to embrace the old traditions of Japan entirely as he seeks to fix everything and reunite with Mitsuha once and for all.There's a surprising amount to digest in this movie, from the more technical narrative elements of character moments, foreshadowing, and the shake up of the story's chronology, to the more emotional and philosophical undercurrents of what it all means. The only other thing I knew about this movie going in was that it was quite an emotional one, and while I admit I didn't have a particularly huge emotional reaction to it at the time, I've not been able to shift the movie from the forefront of my mind since the credits rolled. Fundamentally it's a movie about longing for that missing part of you. Living life unsatisfied, forever feeling like there's more, but you don't know what it is you're even looking for.Of course for Mitsuha and Taki it's each other, but it's also more than that. They get to live out their dreams and desires when they swap bodies. Mitsuha gets to try out the big city, the hustle and bustle of crowds round every corner, the advent of places to hang out and eat, and having things to spend money on at her fingertips. Even the notion of work is something she relishes in. But more importantly it's an escape from her small town, from the pressures of her family, from the traditions of old Japan from laying tokens at shrines, to chewing and spitting out rice to make traditional sake as a ritual to the gods and spirits. For Taki the benefits aren't quite as clear, particularly in the body swaps, but by the end he learns more about the history of Japan, he learns about the significance of certain rituals, and gets to experience life in a quaint town in the middle of nowhere. But when we see him in Mitsuha's body, it's usually in the typical ways you'd expect a teenage boy to explore being female. In fact the movie opens with him waking up in her body, looking down at her chest and groping her boobs, before making his way to the mirror and dressing slowly. It's at this point I remembered how creepy anime can get, and it's unfortunate a movie as beautiful and thought-provoking as this still isn't immune to gratuitous panty shots of teenage girls. It was super awkward in Evangelion, and near movie-ruining in Digimon Tri. At least here it's kept to a bare minimum, and somewhat makes a degree of sense considering it's exactly what every teenage boy would do in that situation (although I draw the line at the shots up Mitsuha's skirt as she's cycling, that was plain unnecessary).
On a more technical merit, Your Name is nothing short of astounding. The animation is some of the most impressive hand-drawn animation I've ever seen. The most strikingly impressive animation was the existence of a camera. The entire movie is animated as if it was captured in live action, and painstaking detail goes into recreating the effects of filming a scene, from replicating depth of field and aperture, focussing on the foreground and blurring the background, or even deliberately animating imperfect camera movements as it struggles to keep with the movements of a dancer. Even a simple stroll through the forest is a marvel to watch as a multitude of plates move across the screen at different speeds, giving the scene an unfathomable amount of depth. It's not just foreground trees moving faster than background ones, but individual branches and leaves move at different rates as well. And of course the lines and colouring are damn impressive too, so crisp and clear in every shot,. Even when blurred in the background, it's easy to tell what is meant to be there. The choice of colours is also fantastic as well, especially when it comes to the comet or the varying degrees of sunlight. The comet itself is a work of art, full of rich blues, pinks, and purples. But the sunlight as it shifts from afternoon to dusk, to magic hour, and finally to night is breathtaking. Hell even there's even a subtle twinkling of stars in the sky. Absolutely phenomenal animation work here.As for the music by Radwimps, a lot of it is your typical anime soundtrack. There's a couple of pop-rock tracks written to elicit fairly simple emotions like happiness or melancholy. There's also over-complicated jazz tracks of guitar noodling and violins over tinkling pianos. If you know modern anime music, you know what I'm talking about here. As the movie turns, so does the music though, offering us more minimalistic soundscapes, placed exclusively to bolster the emotional currents of the scenes in which they're placed. Honestly it's really good from start to finish, but the more typical anime-type music just isn't my style, and I just found it a little in-your-face and distracting, but that's just me.I come to the end of this review feeling like I've failed to really encapsulate my feelings on this movie. It's a technical marvel down to the tiniest details, there's absolutely no denying that, but I feel like there's way more to the emotional turmoil of this film than I've put into words here, and yet I don't feel there's anything else I can really say differently. It's a movie that drags you into the lives of its characters deeper than you'd expect, and it deals with its themes in such an emotionally reserved and mature way that it's a refreshing watch no matter your state of mind. It'll have you crying, it'll have you laughing, it'll have you smiling and yelling in frustration, it'll have you biting your nails and rolling your eyes. It's movie that perfectly captures the feeling of waking up from a dream, as well the feeling that something is missing but you don't know what. It's heartbreaking and heartwarming all in the same sentence. For now I'm settling on a solid 8/10 for Your Name, but honestly it could go either way with rewatches. And I can definitely foresee me rewatching this further on down the line. There's a lot to digest that I'm not even sure a second viewing would settle. All I know is that it is a movie that will linger with me for a while, and I'm totally okay with that."
" how can a movie be this .. amazing
",2020-09-11 00:00:00,10,"To give you an idea of what this review means, yeah .. I don't do this stuff like AT ALL, so I've never done a review of a movie. Hell , forget a review i barely even rate movies but YO FR this movie bangs HARD"
" A real tearjerker.
",2020-09-10 00:00:00,10,"The originality of the movie is amazing. It is one of the most authentic movies I've ever seen. It's such a smartly made movie with such a unique concept. Haven't seen something like this in a while.The raw feelings and emotions with which the story is told is extraordinary. Both always met in their dreams but I was always wondering when will they meet in reality. They loved each other. By the end of the movie, I was satisfied when they met. It's a powerfully moving scene. I was so engrossed and was always anticipating something that I hardly noticed the movie's run time. Such a beautiful portrayal of human emotions.The physical significance of the breaded cord/thread that Taki and Mitsuha wear in the movie is beautiful. I simply admired the genius with which the thread was used to signify the connection between the phases of time and between Taki and Mitsuha; how Taki essentially saved lives of so many people by warning Mitsuha about the comet strike in advance.The beauty of the movie is exemplary. It's one of the most beautiful anime movies I've seen. The scenes with the comet, the lake, snowfall at the end, the countryside, the mountains, Mitsuha's town, Tokyo landscape, just about everything was so, so spectacular to watch. I would have loved to see this movie in a theatre.The songs at the beginning and at the end of the movie were so emotional. The music was very engaging throughout the movie. The lyrics perfectly described the states of mind of both the characters. The songs were really the icing on the cake.The opening scene and the closing scene of the movie were great. Such a great beginning to the movie. The opening, synced monologue was a nice touch. The end, well like I said earlier, I was extremely satisfied by the end of the movie when they finally meet in the reality."

" Interesting. Visually appealing
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,9,"It kept me on my seat. Also, as a person living in Japan (working in Tokyo), the imagery and scenery portrayed in this movie is so real, they even used the real sound from train stations. This made the movie so relatable and it felt real to the core. The story is unique in a way that I did not feel like I could predict what would come up next. When a movie does that, you know it is gonna be good."

" Ethereal and Unexpected
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,10,"""I feel like I'm always searching for someone, or something.""Two words that best describe this piece for me: Ethereal and Unexpected. The surprise of watching a good movie without having it given out to you only by the trailer is rather unusual. However, Your Name is a film in which you dive into the story and as the minutes pass by you realize that what had everything to be just another love story with predictable scenes is nothing but unexpected.
Beyond the unexpected factor, the story revolves around the idea of fate and time as a crucial element to the narrative. Therefore, the idea of the unexpected links perfectly with the notion of how people may be actually expected in others' lives, which also brings up the concept of The Red String Of Fate.
Besides the romantic premise, the plot also holds a great twist for those who think that it is going to be as recycled as many of nowadays' love story productions.
In conclusion, Kimi no Na wa is a lovely mix of drama, romance, fantasy and even adventure, which contributes to the like of many viewers. With Ethereal looking scenes and even better quotes, it's an emotional production full of meanings and concepts throughout the storyline!"
" I smell a commercial flop coming
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,7,"This was different and fun. I know nothing about Japanese cartoons, but enjoyed this very much. I will watch more if there are more like this and there are recommendations. Now if there is a live action remake coming I look forward to reading how it flopped in the newspaper and say 'I told you so.'"

" Still thinking about this movie, gut punches me
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,10,"Every single frame can be framed upon a wall as ART. The hand drawn animation awes me so much.Concept is simple, boy and girl change spirits, number of fanfic I had about that topic ;)
Those pretty well handled... Using notes and going into relationships. I thought the movie was ganna be simple- girl and boy with flaws learns about other person's flaws and now they are good. Yes it had those but the twist at the start of 2nd half scattered me.I still think about this film and get transported to the moment when I saw that 3 year comet scene unfolding. If the movie ended there I would be so finished, actually would have loved this a lot more than 10 stars if it ended there, I love tragedies.Even the side characters were well developed and likeable.
I had thoughts of why don't you call each other? That got sorted out.The ending had emotional stacks and was beautiful that it happened that way. Could have better as said by director himslef. The start was confusing, I do love achrological storytelling, rewatches of beginning cleared them out.Loved the hints that Mitsuha's mother and grandma also had similar stories. Head canon, Mitsuha's father and mother got connected in this way and her father understood she was also going through similar phase. Her grandma probably lost her spirit changing boyfriend to Hiroshima ;)"
" For a person who doesnt watch anime films this one was a real surprise
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,7,"Your Name is a 2016 romantic fantasy anime about two teens from different time frames one from 2013 the other from 2016 who switch bodies(picture Its A Boy Girl Thing meets The Lakehouse). Throughout the course of the film the two try to meet up. But will they meet up and fall in love or will tragedy strike?
The animation is nice,the voice acting is good(I had no idea who the actors were and that was a good thing as normally I'd have the actor in my head the minute they talk),plus the storyline was straightforward.If your a fan of anime films or just a fan of animation in general I would highly recommend you to watch this on Netflix.Thumbs up"

" A True Modern Masterpiece
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,10,"The hypnotising visuals, the captivative characters and the unique soundtrack all come together into a rollercoaster of feelings that makes you forget entirely that you're watching a movie, let alone an animated one. The real charm of the movie is after it ends, leaving you with the feeling that this world and these characters are actually out there. Living."
" 'Your Name': A romantic, teeny-bopper
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,10,"""Your Name"" starts with a premise that is familiar from other supernatural comedies: two Japanese teens - country girl Mitsuha and Tokyo boy Taki - find themselves repeatedly switching bodies in their dreams, leading to some predictably silly comedy regarding body parts, as well as the expected love story. But what sounds like a romantic riff on ""Freaky Friday"" soon turns into something stranger and more mysterious, as writer-director Makoto Shinkai introduces an element of time travel and the transmigration of souls that thickens, if not deepens, the plot.
The film's crisp and clean visuals are genuinely lovely, and they sharply render the distinctions between Taki's hectic urban life and Mitsuha's sleepy rural home. But a sound track featuring cheesy, power-rock ballads often overwhelms the pretty visuals. And the narrative - which involves not just straightforward body-switching but the theme of destinies intertwined - can get a bit confusing. At one point, Taki, while he is ""possessed"" by the spirit of Mitsuha, tries to find her - or is that him? - on the astral plane by drinking kuchikamizake, which is essentially the alcoholic fermented spit of Mitsuha. You may need a shot of that for any of this to make sense."
" THE BEST
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,10,"I started watch it expecting an ordinary teen drama but it took me by surprise with an amazing plot twist!!! Loved it!Your Name is a masterpiece of young adult audience. Believe me. Even though, is kid friendly on Netflix (which I disagree).Kudos!"
" Beautiful heartwarming story

the story is righteous, the friendship is noble, there is a major disaster and we feel in the midst of it and the girl and co-worker are pretty and slender.Watch this please."
" A heart whelming animated movie
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,9,"It's my 1st review on imdb so kindly ignore mistakes, and this is my honest opinion. So everything about this movie is perfect. from beginning to end its kept you at edge of your seat. I'm cutting 1 star beacause it's felt little bit shorter when they changes personalities it went too fast, I wanted to they explore more about their world. and when the went to his former life(became sutsuki) it felt choppy and fast paste. Other then this movie is a classic highly recommend to anyone especially if you are 16-22."

" ""I feel like I'm always searching"" and with this movie I found it.
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,9,"Personal Rating: 8.6/10I went into this movie with average expectations. I walked away with a newfound respect for a whole other culture, art style, way of expressing things, and a new all-time favourite movie.I am in no way an anime fanatic, studio ghibli being the furthest I've gone with the genre. But with this film, I think I might be in love. The visuals are stunning, moving. You feel emotion from the sweeping scapes and this film doesn't mind showing you more than the character sees. It's a very expansive and fluid lens you view the world through, expanding your appreciation for the sights, landscapes, and locations.The characters. My goodness. This film juggles two protagonists and builds them better than most movies build just one. You quickly identify with both characters, mimicking their emotions throughout the movie. A credit to the wonderful storytelling. Characters are often where movies fall apart for me, but in this film, the arcs, motivation, everything is beautifully thought out.The soundtrack delicately balances sweeping orchestral pieces with pop-rock, each song fits the moment, influencing the perfect rollercoaster of emotions.Were there some imperfections, yes, why do both protagonists not have passwords on their phones? Also, the sequence of exposition halfway through was on the nose and could've had more shown than said, but this movie is already 2 hours long, so it's hard to fault this. They masked the sequence with humour and fast-paced transitions making it feel more bearable.This movie can be enjoyed or it can be loved. It can be watched on a surface level, or you can dive into the depths of the themes and complicated storyline. For a movie to do both so well shows how expertly crafted it was, it wasn't a blueprint film, it was a passion project.To summarize, I can't believe it took me 4 years to watch this movie. Do yourself a favour and watch it right now so you know what you've been missing out on.Theme of Mithusa - Kimi no Na Wa"

However, I decided to watch this movie and trust me, it was my best decision of this month. The concept of this movie is amazing. Loved it! However, the ending was bit of a disappointment. But still, I have nothing to complain."
" Underwhelming
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,5,I found Your Name to be highly underwhelming. While the animation and overall presentation are fantastic. I couldn't get into the story and characters at all. I found the characters were either extremely cliched or bland. I couldn't care less about their journey. So when scenes that were meant to be emotionally impactful happened I was left rather unaffected. It doesn't help that a lot of the music choices were really out of place and cheesy.The films plot gets very messy and convoluted in its second act and only goes downhill from there. It doesn't help that the plot is derivative of films such as Donnie Darko and Freaky Friday. While I wouldn't say I hated this film. I was very disappointed by it. Nothing about Your Name apart from the gorgeous animation impressed me at all. I was thoroughly bored by this film. I know Your Name is highly acclaimed. If people like this film that's great though it's not for me.

" Forget Disney! We have movies like Your Name.
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,10,"Your Name is just a good movie. This movie felt long, but not too long. All the way through, I was asking what would happen next. It was clever, emotional, and left me crying after the movie. The twist was done really well, and I almost wanted to pause the movie. Also, the animation is gorgeous. You get to see detailed images from many angles and perspectives, and there were hundreds of animators! The credits didn't start out with the cast like it usually would. The first thing you saw after a black screen was hundreds of names of animators and designers. I watched this movie again and I still felt my muscles ready to let tears out. I would not recommend this movie any less than the next guy, so what are you waiting for? Get a couple of friends and watch Your Name!"
" A new take on 'soul-mate-ism'
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,9,The fact that this is an animated film and not a live action gives the story the right amount of 'lightness' to its very deep take on love and being fated.A good weekend watch for people who want to remember how it feels to be young and in love again without that icky feeling.

",2020-07-16 00:00:00,6,"Standard love to save the earth, the role is too thin, the second half of the delay, the end is embarrassing, feel 90 minutes can solve a story, the result took more than 100 minutes"

" Maybe this will be my favorite movie in Shinkai's movie
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,9,"Before, I liked Shinkai's movie because of its scenery, but this time it was entirely because of the story. Although it is an unrealistic, sci-fi story, the emotional expressions between the protagonists really moved me.

" Wow

The story was absolutely fantastic.
The characters were greatly written, We definitely felt what they felt.
The story's perfectly paced, We enter the story by not knowing anything."
" great
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,9,"As winter turns to spring, the occasional glimpse on the subway, a startlingly similar feeling, makes them look for each other. But when they met, they didn't have the courage to speak. They tried to resist the impulse and lowered their heads silently to pass by, teaching all the audience to worry about them.
Until the boy Taki a bow, a bite, Shouting: Excuse me, Where have I seen you?
The girl smiled with tears and said: Me too.
Touched in this moment to the extreme, this pure and beautiful love makes people envy, in the two disease and girl heart at this moment are worthy of forgiveness, is really unable to resist the good.
All encounters in the world are long separation and repetition, even if you have not really met each other, but maybe in a dream. After all, dreams are things that disappear when we wake up.
Enjoy the dream, or treasure every person you meet, or tell me your name."
" Favorite movie
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,7,"Xinhaicheng uses this story to warm everyone in the city who still wants to believe in love. In such a big world, being able to meet you requires so much effort. Through the misplaced time and space, looking up at the falling stars, you didn't leave your name, but I can't forget the phrase ""I love you""."
" The end finally made up for the regret of missing the speed of five centimeters per second
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,8,"The story is familiar, but it can always make people feel, just like watching so many tragedies and comedies, but every time you watch it, you can have emotions. But to this anime I don't want to talk about too many personal feelings, just want to recommend!"
" Beautiful
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,10,"I haven't watched an anime show/ film in a long time and this was definitely the perfect one to reintroduce me back. The art style and scenery, the soundtrack and the story are so very beautiful. I feel like this film transported me on such a wonderful but emotional journey. If you are considering giving it a watch then do It, you won't be disappointed."
" Weathering with you : Finally an worthy oponent, our battle will be legendary
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,8,"I had a really tough time to rate it.
Because I'm in love with weathering with you. Then I saw it.
So it is hard for me to Place it over my favorite japani movies. Still it's one of my favorite. And please japan, make such a beautiful movie so I can focus only in you, not in American remake."
" change my mind
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,9,"What can anime bring us?
Maybe just like the movie, anime can also dream for us, maybe we will never reach the world of the second element, but only this hopeless and unavailable feeling is the most moving!
As a form of anime, ""Your Name"" does bring me the feeling that other films are difficult to convey. Man is a contradictory complex, which is what can be brought to us through those unique works.
Even though love and thoughts may be so rare in real life, we will still keep searching because I believe it will exist. Looking for that particular person in a huge city, and the name that I have forgotten but lingered in my heart, two tiny individuals connected by knots beyond time and space, this thought will still exist forever.Perhaps we will be entangled in the fact that Sanye and Taki in the film dare not recognize each other, but imagine who in reality you and I dare to travel thousands of miles to find that TA with consciousness?
Xin Haicheng brought a moving story this time and accompanied by the beautiful picture as always, ""Your Name"" may not be perfect, and there are even various plot bugs, but just like ""City of Philharmonic"" for movies and dance films In the same way, it still made me a fan who rarely watched anime began to like Japanese anime and moved me for a long time.
Xinhaicheng used its own way to wear the local culture of Japan to the whole world through anime. Perhaps this also provided a template for creators to spread the national culture to the whole world!
Maybe one day we can stand together at the moment the comet crosses the horizon, hug each other and say the one that will never be forgotten: your name."
" Just perfect
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,10,"Perfect story, perfect music, perfect drawing, everything about it is perfect."
" A great story, a greater teller
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,9,"This movie proves once again that CGI and SFX might make a movie nice for your eyes, your mind however, desires something else.
Finally (after a long long time of movies with stolen ideas) a unique story and a great one. so special, and refreshing.The story here may be good, but the way it is being told is far greater. Having a map of secrecy, revealing information and new founding piece by piece with patient without losing the audience's attention.
Keeping the audience, not in superior position, neither inferior position, but with as much knowledge as the protagonists, ""glues"" them to the screen and create sympathy with the protagonists since they share the same will: Figuring out what the hell is happening.Every part, every detail in this amazing story serving a general goal up ahead in the story progression map, another fact that makes the audience forget how to walk while watching the movie.Thank you for bringing this idea in to life."
" ""At the end we all find that 1 person we are destined to meet""
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,10,One of the greatest movie ever made!! It's only one and half hour long but contains such deep reality. It reminds us that no matter how parted we're from our one true love. We will always find our way back to them.
" Kimi no na wa beat anime
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,10,"Kimi no na wa is best anime film ever,and I think it's story is awesome if you watch it you start watch it multiple times"
" AWESOME
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,10,"What a amazing movie it is. wonderful music and animations.
story is fantastic 😍 really loved it. you should watch it before you die."
" It's okay but not THAT good.
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,7,"The movie was clearly made to be on big screen and make everyone averagely happy. The animation and emotion? I expected much more of Makoto Shinkai who was behind the art of the opening and trailer of Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two. That was stunningly beautiful animation and storytelling! Instead, you can find a more generic style in this one with loads of anime and drama/romance clichés: Cute and generic sounding voice actors? Check! Older and cool character who smokes? Check! Bad parent? Check! Wise and cute grandma? Check! Not-that-beautiful best friend? Yes! I could go on...""I'm adding shrine culture and craftsmanship!"" was also there big time. One thing that was totally absent for me was that the romance between the characters was based on...nothing.
The soundtrack reminded that of a big screen American animation but sung in Japanese. It sounded musical-like and childish at times. Plot was average to a higher level of average. It's a body-swap movie as one can see in the trailer and that's been done a lot before. However, there's a good twist which made me enjoy the movie a lot in the end, combined with other elements of the second half. I'd recommend watching on in case the first half doesn't do the trick for you. All in all, not a masterpiece or anything but watchable."
" Really just fantastic
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,10,"I really can't think of any flaws I had with this movie. I just loved everything about it, but I'll break it down anyway.The plot was unexpectedly great. I knew this was a body swap movie going in but it took in a lot of ways I didn't at all except. There were actually a lot of twists I did not see coming and that only added to my emotional investment. The film has an interesting structure because in the first like half of this movie, it feels more like a comedy. The body swap thing applies itself to a lot of great comedy. But after a certain twist it becomes much more dramatic and suspenseful, and strangely enough it feels completely natural and not at all jarring.A lot of this investment has to do with the main two characters, Taki & Mitsuha. It's incredible how the movie creates this incredible romance between them even though they only meet eachother for like an accumulative 4 minutes in the whole movie. The side characters are good too though nothing impressive.Also the technical aspects of this are perfect. The animation is beautiful, but I kinda expected that. Something cool I did notice though was a lot of repeated camera angles which I found quite interesting.This movie gets 90% from me."
" Sentimental but well made
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,7,"The visual quality of this film is outstanding. I loved the premise and all the little interactions between the characters. However, it did not handle its science fiction aspect very smoothly and it became too forced and sentimental."
" Seek, and meet
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,7,"At the beginning, I didn't understand it very much. I found that it was interesting for two people to exchange their bodies. In the process of exchange, the two people actually liked each other. They both came to each other's city, but they couldn't meet each other. Later, I found that the two people came from different time, not time. In order to prevent the town from disappearing, they worked together to protect the town.Although I forget your name, you do not remember me, but we will still look for that familiar figure. Love in different time and space, no matter how many times I will forget you, I will remember your name in the future.A very tender movie."
" One of the greatest love stories of our time.
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,10,"I try not to give too much credit to emotionally driven movies these days, especially with how many flood the market on a daily basis. However, this movie touched an aspect of love told in a very interesting manner of development. The connection Mitsuha and Taki share is one of the deepest connections I've ever seen portrayed in film, animated or live action. I found myself bound to them in a manner that few love stories can hold me and was riveted throughout the film. I only hope that Hollywoods attempt to recreat it will do justice to Shinkai-sama's story as it needs to be one that the world can enjoy in every manner available."
" Great Animation
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,8,"And great story.Multiple watches later and I am not tired.
Please tell Hollywood not to whitewash this one. Please."
" Sad and hopeful
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,8,"This bond between strangers in the city is both sad and hopeful. Usually we can only see its sadness, because in a crowded city, no matter how close the bodies of two strangers are in space, they cannot be directly converted into spiritual closeness. Sometimes, it even contrasts the spiritual indifference, isolation and isolation of urban people.
In ""Your Name"", the first time Sanye and Taki met face-to-face was on the crowded subway in Tokyo. Because of the misalignment of time, Trefoil is just one of countless strangers who meet every day. At this time, the stranger Sanye told Taki her name, but Taki easily forgot the stranger who met him."
" 9/10 rating (the highest score I've given hitherto): Wonder-ful!
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,9,"A wonderfully-told story -- a fantasy -- grounded in real emotions and feelings. Each character, even the minor ones, feels real and relatable in their own way. The interspersed humor is nice in light of the intensity of the underlying events.The scene that evoked the most emotion for me is the first part of the flashback, where the mother has baby Mitsuha next to her and names her, the next moment where the father lovingly calls his daughter and wife his ""treasures,"" and the death of Mitsuha's mother, when the daughter asks, ""Dad, when is Mom going to come home?"" The naming scene makes me think of my late mother, and the intense emotional bond she must have felt at the birth of each of her children. It brings tears to my eyes.This flashback scene in ""Your Name"" is at the level of, or even more emotionally impactful than, the first minutes of the Disney/Pixar animation ""Up"" that summarizes Ellie and Carl's life, beautifully.When I thought that Mitsuha and many in the town had perished, it made me very sad. Then, a miracle happens because of Taki's perseverence and love. Although a fantasy, this anime has inspirational messages and deep meaning."
" One of the greatest films of all time
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,10,"You'd be hard pressed to find a more touching, heart wrenching, beautiful, just all around impactful movie in any genre. Those who don't like anime might find it hard to get into, but it's really their loss. There's also the Japanese/American cultural differences, but all in all this movie is up there with Spirited Away."
" Better than ""weathering with you""
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,9,"I watched this movies after ""weathering with you"". Honestly, ""Your name"" is better than ""weathering with you"". Just only share my feelings, ""your name"" is much more touch my heart!"
" A remarkably beautiful piece of cinema
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,8,"What an incredibly beautiful film. I haven't watched a great deal of movies in this genre, but I can't imagine there are many more spectacular than this. I did find however, that the story became confusing towards the end and could have done with less jumping around. I would also have preferred less prompting from the characters' internal dialogues as it didn't mesh well with the ethereal nature of the film. Regardless, this is a film of such visual beauty and splendour that it should go on everyone's must-watch list."
" Almost Perfect
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,9,"Your Name has everything you could ask for: characters, story, humor, drama, suspense, mystery, ectIt is well drawn and shows the beauty as well as significant differences between urban and rural Japan.And whereas this could've just been a basic ""switch bodies"" comedy that we've all seen before, the plot twists in very unexpected and sincerely thought-provoking directions.It explores concepts such as love, ambition, desire, sacrifice, connection, time, memories, companionship and devotion.I would have given this the full 10 stars but the music choice in the film doesn't fit. An orchestral score would have been most appropriate, and in fact is used at times. However, the film paradoxically chooses to use standard anime pop-rock that is more befitting to a romantic-comedy than that deeper topics it goes into. The music choice is at best off-putting and at worst, distracting to the messages within the film."
" PURE BEAUTY.
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,10,"I am a very tough guy, I very rarely shed even a drop of tear for even most sad movies. But when this got over, my eyes were watery, I had a really strange feeling in my stomach, a weird happiness arose in me. But I think I shouldn't have watched this because now every other romantic movies, Anime or live-action seems pale. Not up to mark. Such a great concept, and be prepared for one of the most visually stunning Anime that'll leave you mesmerized. I don't know why people say that this movie's plot isn't anything new, because I have never seen anything even close to this movie's plot. A must watch guys, won't disappoint you. And yes, try to avoid as many spoiler as possible before watching it or the magic of this plot will fade."
" This movie is an art
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,10,"Just brilliancy, a beautiful story , beautiful character build, nothing more to say. This movie is a must watch."
" Anime at it's best
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,9,Even though the characters are animated someone can feel connected to them and cares about there feelings. A MUST WATCH
" Phenomenal except for two things
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie, it's fantastic. Your Name is definitely my favorite animated movie of all time, and it's almost perfect. If you want an idea of how good this film is, then just look at some of the other reviews.I only have two small nitpicks to complain about in the whole film. The first one is that the fan service in Your Name is quite annoying. I get that this is a film that (successfully) appeals to all kinds of anime fans, so this was necessary to add in. But it isn't for me.Secondly some of the plot elements needed to be fleshed out more. The whole thing of how they are able to see each other during one part of the movie felt very arbitrary. And it wasn't clear at all why their memories of each other would fade away when they stop body switching. Some of it could use a little cleaning up is what I'm saying.Other than that, all of the good things about Your Name are true, and I would definitely reccomend this movie to anyone who likes animated movies. Go watch it."
" One of the best movie I've ever watched.
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,10,"While watching, I cried a lot. This isn't a movie, it's an emotion which is unforgettable. And the background music were also amazing."
" this . is . it .
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,10,"An amazing storyline, great concept and very pleasing. i watch a lot of anime, and a lot of movies as well. i was never interested much into romance and drama. but after watching this movie, oh my poor heart.
10/10 for a great movie, 100% would watch again."
" Best animie in the world
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,10,"This is my first animie,and till now I can't find this level of animie."
" Loved it
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,10,"I've watched this film several times and I don't think I could ever get tired of it! I got totally caught on the story, Kimi no na wa has the perfect amount of drama, mistery and love. I cry my eyes out every time i see it (bit sensitive) and most of the people I recommended this movie loved it too. Please don't let anybody ruin this by doing a remake, thanks !!!"
" Perfect in every way
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,10,"I have no real critic for this, is heartwarming, original, innocent somehow, it's an epic romance without being in your face at all. Visually beautiful, crazy at some moments, funny at others. It's divine, so glad I chose it for a special date."
" I wasn't interested anymore on anime but changed after this
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,10,"I was curious of the high rating of this movie so I watched even this was an anime, although I'm anime fan before so I still watched. I didn't expect there's a movie this great, just in the beginning of the movie it was very entertaining, very unique and very funny. hahaha! I thought that this might be better if done by real actors and actresses, but I this this (anime) would be better, I have seen many anime movies that make a live-action but didn't work, so this is totally fine. No movies to watch? You'd better try this if your not allergic to anime. Unbelievable story, very unique, somehow mind-blowing and you'll fall to the movie. And the animation, the details, the graphics on the background, really great. The creator of the movie is very good."
" One of the best move story
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,8,Unique concept and some of the frames are mind blowing that kinda of frame are not able to create in real movies it is only possible in anime . The story of the girl and boy had portray in best way .
" Love Story connected by an Auspicious Thread of time
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,9,A love story set in two different times but connected by an Auspicious Thread. Many supernatural factors and time travel cross path with their story. All of a sudden everything gets vanished just like a dream. Yet the Auspicious Thread keeps them connected throughout the story. First of all Salute to such a concept and as an anime viewer this was my first film and I really enjoyed it. Cant wait to watch more like this.
" Best Ever
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,10,"Every one know at least by now, how great a movie is this."
" wonderful
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,8,"Finally, ""your name"" is more than simply about the loneliness and love of young men and girls, but in the depiction of delicate and profound personal feelings, and further extended to a larger philosophical proposition: especially the modern life of ""space"" and ""time"" re-interpretation."
" Absolutely perfect
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,10,"I loved the whole movie from beginning to end.
The ending is so beautiful. Literally when the LAST sentence is said, I immediately started crying. It was so powerful and had so much meaning."
" Very Japanese
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,9,It starts out very light hearted but then because more serious and carries meaning. It's very Japanese and connects with Japanese history and culture.
" I'm Still Not Convinced
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,6,"The film isn't incompetently made but I found it incredibly difficult to maintain my suspension of disbelief with this one.The body swapping is fine but I don't understand how sabotaging the other's life while acting as them somehow leads to romance between them. There are two possible scenarios this film offers in terms of the fate of Mitsuha and her hometown: either the comet destroyed it and everyone died or she managed to save everyone from the beginning. Either way, the whole sequence where Taki travels the ruins of her hometown is entirely unnecessary. My biggest fear is that they manage to change the course of history which is the only thing that could give the whole sequence of Taki looking for Mitsuha's hometown purpose but that would only make it worse for me. Ideally the film should have ended with Mitsuha's death or, to compromise, she had always survived the incident and they had both completely forgotten each other and it ends in a scene where they walk past each other completely oblivious to the other.The magical aspects of films like this are what make Your Name so frustrating for me. Everything about the writing makes the film feel like the God of the Machine can force their bidding so that the outcome remains the same regardless of the circumstances.Despite the litany of issues I have with the writing of the film, I will say that it is a good looking one almost seamlessly marrying 2D animation with CG animation. I also found some of the gags related to the body swapping plot device to be humorous though there is one particular one that's a bit overplayed.I don't see where the romance comes from this. The two characters live each other's lives as the other so wouldn't it make more sense if romance happened between them and one of the other characters they met while being the other? I see the emotion and the voice acting is superb but I don't understand why these characters feel so strongly for the other.I feel like this film could have gone in to more interesting directions than where it did and having given it another chance I'm still not convinced that this is the masterpiece so many others say it is. There's another film that is live action which is very similar to this one that came out the same year which, I think, managed to execute its variation of this kind of story much more effectively with considerably less.The film is alright in my opinion but I'm in the minority. Most believe that it is a masterwork and I believe that, despite my difference of opinion, it deserves a fair shot for anyone curious about it. Don't necessarily take my word for it, see it for yourself and come to your own conclusion."
" Just OK
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,6,"This isn't the best movie you're ever watch. I've even seen the story with the red cord done before (Case Closed: The Time Bombed Skyscraper).My issues with this film: Time travel elements just seem like a plot convenience. The body switching doesn't make sense, especially how she has a family history of this. The romance doesn't feel believable and isn't explained well.Things I like: I really like the art style, especially how a contrast between city versus rural. The music is quite fitting. The coming-of-age elements are done quite well.If you like Japanese anime you'll like this movie, but this isn't the best movie you'll ever watch."
" Never expected such Emotions!
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,9,"Almost. Amazing an anime would delivery such wonderful emotions.
Not a big fan of animes.
Yet this one deserves a standing applause!
How can I miss this masterpiece on 2016!!??
Never underestimate an anime again. Ever!! Imo"
" fantastic
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,10,"This movie is by far my favorite of many animation movies, it's magical and fantastic, not only that it's completely beautiful and so visual, it's worthy of any award, you should watch it, pal."
" Through the misplaced time and space
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,8,"Xinhaicheng uses this kind of story to warm everyone in the city who is still willing to believe in love. In such a big world, to meet you, it takes so much effort. Through the misplaced time and space, looking up at the falling stars, you did not leave your name, but I can not forget the phrase ""I love you"""
" Great!
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,10,"Love the way movie runs, every bit of a moment gives us a hope , the hope for the lovely future may the two characters meet... Though movie ended with a happy note. Still feels like something missing in me this movie makes me sad :("
" I like this movie more than I thought.
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,8,"I watched The Garden of Words a few years ago, which left me with the impression that Makoto Shinkai's visual pictures are beautiful but the plot is not exciting enough. This time, it was still a Makoto Shinkai-style movie, but the plot became much more interesting, and the sub-lens was even better. Although the plot is fictional and unrealistic, I am still moved by it."
" Lovely
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies of Makato Senkai I really wounder his way story and love the animation of this movie, the twist of the story as well as all the fun. This movie is a combo pack containing all the genres. I personally recommend you to watch it and you will fall in love with anime movies"
" Any drug which erases a part of your memory?
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,10,I just want to experience watching this movie for the first time. Breathing. I've never ever been as moved watching a movie in my life like this brilliant film has managed to move me. Every scene is a treat for the eyes. What a beautiful climax. The Japanese are really hardcore masters of perfection.
" It's hard to understanding first time
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,10,I like the ending most when they saw together. Bt first when i saw i was just thinking what thay do weird things always. Bt ending i slowly slowy understand everything. Bt 2 time i saw this movie then i understand everything.
" great
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,9,"Touching love story. With a knot to wear the story of constant search, forget, recall, save the hearts of ""important people, can't forget the people, don't want to forget the people."" What's neat about taki and mitsuha in the film is that in the first half of the story, there's no dating, no gift-giving, no hand-holding, nothing like the usual love story, and nothing too obtuse."
" A really full-hearted and moving anime
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,9,"I must say I though it would have been hard to find a director who could hold a candle to master Miyazaki but here comes Makoto Shinkai with this tender and soft yet profound story.What really hit me hard, besides the artistic direction which was stunning, was the unexpected plot twist that gets the story really interesting driving it from a funny and light teen-based comedy to a really remarkable reflection about time, space and the interconnectivity through all things.
The only ""bad"" note I can make is about the soundtrack. Not as in it wasn't good, but in the way that I didn't quite like all songs; but maybe I'm just too used to the highest Joe Hisaishi standards.In conclusion I can't really believe I waited all these years to finally enjoy this touching story and if by any chance you're reading this, don't waste any more time and jump into this beautiful tale and get lost in it like I did."
" Absolutely stunning
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,10,This movie is one of the best out there imo. The movie had me in literal tears and it had a unique way of helping us root for the main characters

" A remedy for those who don't believe in romantic movies
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,8,"""Your name"" or ""Kimi no nawa"" is an animated movie directed and written by Makoto Shinkai. Definitely, this movie with his plot, photography and soundtrack, will make you travel through the time. Even if the idea of change genre rolls was really exploited by differents movies in the last decade, the exploration around the cultural life between the city and town is an element that plays in favor to the history.
I can't tell you that is the best movie that I ever seen in my life, but of course is an art work in the hole sense of the word, specially because of the poetic trama.
Mitsuha, is a teenager that lives in a town called Itomori, everything changes when she start having strange dreams that involve the life of a young man that lives in Tokyo. The feeling of looking for something, strange behaviors, crosses in the space time, will be crucial aspects to resolve the mystery of the dreams."
" Great animation
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,10,My friend's suggestion to watch this movie caused me watch.And now i regret why i watched something so touching which will stay all over my mind for days.The animation was just great.makoto shinkai said it is unhealthy.I would rather agree to this because i was not able to sleep decently about 5 days of watching it😂.
" Give it a try even if it sounds like not your style
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,9,"Oh man did I like this movie! It has everything I look for in a movie: an interesting plot, deep relatable characters, and an atmosphere that leaves a lasting impression for a long time.I heard about this movie a long time ago but the summery didn't sound interesting enough for me. I'm not a big fan of romance nor drama. I decided to eventually give it a try due to the quarantine, and it exceeded my expectations greatly.My only issue with the movie is that it starts slow and gives the impression of a simple romantic drama. I didn't mind much since it drew me more into the story and the character's life, but my husband was extremely bored, so I suppose it's not for everyone.But the plot twist in the middle! Wow! I didn't see it coming. I was at the end of my chair until the movie ended. I especially noticed that they kept the characters reactions not over the top like it's done in so many Animes, it gave a more realistic feeling and felt more like watching a movie and not a cartoon.
Also, the animation is amazing.This is a masterpiece. It's not often that I watch a movie and then still keep thinking about it a few hours later. Too bad you can't see this kind of depth in Hollywood movies that have a much bigger budget."
" I don't like it very much, the plot is very common
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,6,"There are many highlights. Unfortunately, after shaking off the burden, the core turned out to be an old stalk of a vulgar and hypocritical girl in love. The last subway interlaced to recognize what really made me stale. The so-called ""your name"" is terribly overworked, and it is embarrassing in the end. ""Qian and Qianxun"" also talked about ""your name"". Qianxun was forced to erase his name and became Xiaoqian. Xiaobailong retrieved her name. The meaning of the name here is a positioning and return to self-existence, a reflection on the question of essence and ontology of ""who am I"". And ""Your Name"" doesn't say anything, it is a pure girl love anime movie, and it deliberately consumes the girl's heart. The gap is so great that I can't compare the two movies.
On feelings about nature and tradition, they disappeared completely in the later period, and they were top-heavy. Instead, they felt indifferent. Not to mention comparing with Hayao Miyazaki. No matter which movie Miyazaki made, he never deliberately portrayed the feelings of men and women, but none of the men and women is not impressive. Parker and Hida in ""Sky City"", Little White Dragon and Chihiro in ""Thousand and Thousand Seeking"", ""Hall's Moving Castle"" and Hal and Sophie, etc.
Even if it is the emotion and description of the town, compared with ""Little Forest"", it can see a huge gap. After all the scenes turned to Tokyo, the town did disappear.
On the love of girls, it is not as good as ""The Girl Who Traveled Through Time and Space"". The flirty sentence ""I am waiting for you in the future"" is more touching than this repeated deliberate ending. On dog blood hypocrisy, it is not as good as ""My Girls' Generation"", at least hearty, sweet and sweet. ""Your Name"" used the safety of life in a small town to accompany the two to fall in love. It was really depressing. This is too deliberate, too hypocritical, and too hypocritical. Probably I am not young enough.
In the final analysis, the expectations are too high. As far as the films directed by Xin Haicheng are indeed, they are much better than those of the movies he had before, but they should be as good as possible. The Chinese public is too easy to be pleased, and a little jokes are enough to satisfy. A bit of flirtatious sex teasing will make you happy for a long time. In fact, the whole movie's laugh point is almost supported by touching the chest. Maybe it's been a long time since I saw a good-looking anime movie in love. But really, I would rather watch ""Listening to the Ear"" a hundred times. If it's just about falling in love, then have a good time and do so many tricks. Even if you focus on the theme ""I've been looking for someone ... we all had an adventure, met someone I liked, but just forgot his / her name"", it's better than a hodgepodge in the end."
" This film is outright insane.
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,8,"This film is outright insane. the plot leads you to places you never thought you'd go, as well as being creative and shocking. the twist ending is one that will resonate with you for hours afterwards."
" a truly captiviating story
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,9,"Your name is a captiviating animation. of to people who come from diffrent back grounds yet are tied toghether.Mitsuha Miyamizu is a highschool girl who lives in a religous town up in the mountains. But who wants more than a life in a small town. she whiches to be a handsome boy who lives in tokyo in her next life. She begins to swap lives Taki Tachibana a high school boy in tokyo. a beautiful story that blows you away and makes you want to cry.
truely amazing"
" Just a perfect execution
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Great beautiful atmosphere.No miss for this heartwarming story. They really pay attention to the every detail of the plot. Emotions that are built are very intense, they make you think or guess what actually happen most of the time. Yes it's about time travel or something, and of course nobody can escape from the temporal paradox, likewise the story writer, but they can actually make people think that time travel or something is likely possible somehow. I mean this is how Japanese executing a film when they really bet em all.
There might be a some detail that actually strange if you think about it, just like the phone, etc; But i'm sure they leave it for entertainment purpose.Just need another film with this heartwarming story, no doubt."
" Fantastic movie!!!!
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,10,It shows how a unique bond can be created between two young people and ahh...i dont know how to explain it..Its just really good
" Kimi no na wa
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,10,"This time, I gave xinhaicheng 200 points. Ten years ago, when I despised him, he was just pure and fresh, I didn't expect to cry in the cinema one day. Trance saw through time and space the fine field guard in the teenage period. Applaud for all the young girls' heart and the second disease of China. Youth can meet each other without death and save the earth. Now I put on my tears and walked out of the cinema. I saw the young people in the back row take off their glasses and cry loudly..."
" beautiful
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,9,"From the beginning of the song is very good, the picture is very beautiful, the story is very moving. In this impetuous society, how many people still remember the original intention and the original persistence. Good animation with two strokes. It has to be said that the Japanese animation is very attentive in the details of the processing, directly hit the people's hearts, there are laughter and tears, the reduction of the real scene is also very high!"
" You can't beat Kimi no na wa.
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,10,"It's now a month after I've watched your name. I'm telling you, you can't beat this movie. It's impossible to describe this anime with words. Even just listening to the music from your name makes my heart clench and also makes me teary and filled with all sorts of emotions. Your name is my favourite anime by far and for good reasons. The plot and storyline are always making you wonder what's going to happen next. Kimi no na wa is an absolute masterpiece, my heart throbs just thinking of it. I'm a teenage guy yet I still cried and would cry again. You will not find anything better than this anime."
" amazing
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,10,"Your Name is amazing and wonderful , worth it to see that anime"
" Fancy idea
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,7,"The magnificence and mystery of comets always seem to inspire many creative ideas from different creators. New sea to the overall rhythm of the good control, not easy to push full, but more accurate. There will be a lot of regrets in the audience's life. Take some comfort from the fact that the film is over 100 minutes long, during which time those mishaps just don't happen, or believe that one day. At the end, my eyes got sore..."
" Amazing
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,10,"I just saw this so a little later than all the hype. Just stumbled upon this while looking for a decent movie and heard good things about it. Wasn't expecting much and the first few minutes seemed unimpressive at first. Glad I found this movie. It has a really solid storyline, great art, and such a great interesting concept. I'll never forget this movie and it is easily one of my favorite movies now. Highly recommend seeing this stunning twist of a love story."
" Best movie I've ever seen.
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,10,"This movie is beautiful. Perfect picture, perfect animation, beautiful story. You can't keep your eyes off the screen for the last hour of the movie. And finally, the music, it's the best soundtrack I've hear in anything I'd seen, it's simply gorgeous."
" Your first name, my last name
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,"Through the setting, the movie had an explanation at the beginning. The memory after traversing decreases sharply with time, as the movie says most of the time, it can be understood as a dream. We have all experienced how many things we can remember when we wake up are completely uncertain events; and the more you want to remember something, the more you cannot remember it.Xinhaicheng is very good at painting empty mirrors of ""urban landscapes"". ""Your Name"", crowds in subway stations, trams staggered, empty street corners at dusk, white-collar workers buying cigarettes in convenience stores, these seemingly meaningless empty mirrors in the development of the main storyline have always been Xinhaicheng animations s Mark.Exploring urban people's ""hope"": Contrary to ""spatially close, unable to change spiritual alienation, unable to lift people's loneliness"", this kind of hope emphasizes that ""spatially far away can't block spiritual intimacy , Can not cut off the bond between people. ""I ask if one day you have no chat history and contact information with TA, will you still remember everything about the other party? Or think empathically, if it were you, what information would you remember?The intersection of people and people can only be captured in reality, but the relationship between people, put in the world and the coordinates of space and time, is more than life and death.Finally, in the end, may a person in this world like you in a way you do n't know or know."
" Missing and striving is the epitaph of love and youth
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,9,"It's easy to meet, but it's hard to meet again. Body exchange is not a new subject, but the film is still moving. Everyone in a period of life, always believe that they will meet a person who is destined to meet. Even we don't know who he is, but still believe that we will meet each. This kind of ""belief"" that most of us have already given up, so we will go to the movies to see the male and female owners whether they give up or not."
" Gorgeous!
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,7,"It may be a fantasy, it may be animated, but this is both beautiful and brilliantly entertaining. Mitsuha lives in a small idyllic Japanese town, but dreams of something bigger. Being a teenager, being the mayors daughter, she wants out. Taki lives in Tokyo, goes to school, works in a restaurant. When they go to sleep and dream, they switch places. They don't know why, but as they begin to understand what's happening they leave messages for one another to try to navigate each other through lives. Mitsuha seems to enjoy the excitement of Taki's life in the big city. Taki though finds her a meddling influence in what should be his life. There's a suggested spirituality to all this, with Mitsuha's grandmother explaining the concepts of connections, strings through time, through worlds. Despite this, it does occasionally have the tone of an American teen comedy, but it's far too gorgeous to be so one dimensional. On numerous occasions my breath away is taken away by the level of detail, not just in the animation, but the cutting and the plot. It's lovingly crafted with a staggering amount of patience. It doesn't really create a fantasy world in the way that so many Studio Ghibli films do, it's seems more interested in inserting a fantasy element into an otherwise normal everyday world. Then, just as it begins to feel normal, the switches stop and Taki sets out to find Mitsuha. The comet shower that appears to have been linked to the connection, turns out to have destroyed Mitsuha's village 3 years before she ever met Taki. Are they dreaming through time, is she a ghost? It does get a bit complicated, especially when reading subs and it's very sentimental, but I really enjoyed it. Mitsuha and Taki are connected through space and time, a bond that cannot be broken and delivers a fantastic finale that had me gripped! Comets, out of body experiences, an engaging love story and it really does look gorgeous too."
" Amazing animation couple with an impossible story and a cute lovestory.
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,8,"Powerful, Exceptional, Emotional, and Inspirational, Your Name gave it's best view on what can a Human do with the power of it's mind, absolute creative and powerful story with fantastic smooth animations, good music that lets you flow with the movie mood, powerful impact on human emotions if well applied on the viewer, and a good ending that will you take on a ride with your imagination on what will happen next."
" Captivating storyline
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,10,"One of the best Japanese animation I've watched. I love it when the story unfolds in a way that I didn't expect. I was captivated all the way through. There might be some details here and there that might not make the most sense, but hey, it's a fantasy so let's just roll with it."
" The best anime i ever seen

" Best anime ever!
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,10,"One of the best Anime film and My favourite anime film 'Your Name' directed by Makoto Shinkai. This film, Just awesome. Makoto Shinkai potraied this film amazing way. Best anime visual, best music, best background score makes this anime film Masterpiece. But the root of this film is its story, out of the box. This story is about two teenagers, Taki and mitsuha have magical connection about swapping their bodies. But twist is when both loved each other and want to meet. There are many unpredictable twist and turns. Character development is also a strong part of this film. You just love all characters, specially the lead characters. Sometime it tells some facts of life. This film is funny, Sad, emotional and create a mistry, bond you with this film. I love to watch this film much times. And songs! Ahhh I love it. So please don't miss the film. You gonna love it. Best anime film ever."
" Love movies that people yearn for.
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,8,"The director uses such stories to warm everyone who is still willing to believe in love. In such a big world, can meet you, unexpectedly need so hard.

" Watch it
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,8,"I am not a cartoon/animation/anime fan or knowledgeable person, but this one was beautiful and also exotic for a non-Japanese like myself.I hope the success of this feature length doesn't inspire the greedy Hollywood types to assault it like some reviewers are predicting."
" An interesting and beautiful story
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,9,"A beautiful and a bit sad love story. Awesome animation and even better concept. I'm a not an common anime viewer, but this one deserves to be seen more than once.The plot was enigmaticIf you're an emotional person, maybe you're gonna cry with this one"
" I love it
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,10,"In fact, the animation can be completely regarded as a ""love at first sight"" story. For the hero and heroine, we see those fantastic experience, in fact, there is no memory. They just think they're looking for something, and when they see each other at first glance, they immediately confirm, and that's what I've been looking for.Love at first sight, is not such a feeling? The body exchanges, the comets hitting the earth, the time travel, it's like a commentary for two people to meet. This animation seems to say that all love at first sight behind, can have a magnificent story.And all encounters are miracles of fate."
" Absolute masterpiece
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,10,"I rarely give movies or series 10 stars,
but some movies deserved it.Kimi no na wa. was some of the best movies I've ever seen and the best anime movie I've ever seen.
Everything in this movie matches: The characters, the plot, the music, the dialogues, etc.If you really want to see a movie that touches your heart, whatch this. To be worth your time are no words for it."
" Best movie of anime

" Dreams May come True
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,9,"This one was something more than reality. this one was not a animation, to me it's more than reality I connect with the story and it was very sensational probably one of top 3 animation I have ever seen. real amazing piece of art by Makoto Shinkai. as conclusion I should say the way story line followed and the back and forth in time was just amazing and I believe if you want to quite catch the story you should watch this twice or maybe more. I confess I fascinated with this movie and I will see it over and over again."

" A beautiful movie
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,8,"It's very suitable for watching on the big screen of the cinema. It's a great experience of watching the movie. The picture is very delicate. The author is a very powerful person. The picture is very beautiful. It's just that the plot feels a bit old-fashioned, which doesn't surprise me. It's the most feeling when I watch it in the cinema. The picture plus background music is still very enjoyable."

I cannot even forget it. Even though I still wanna watch again and again..."
" Misplaced Time and Space & Right Love
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,8,"This plot is very interesting. It tells that the male and female protagonists in the body exchanged their bodies in an unknown situation, and then they experienced a different life after the body swapped, and then the two loved each other. Then I introduced the reason for this change during the inheritance of the female host family. The hostess's family serves the gods, so this experience is actually what each generation's heirs will have. When you know this, you can understand why you exchange your body. Later plots have different reasons for telling time, they are in different spaces, and there are many jokes appearing for reasons of gender, giving everyone a lot of fun."
" Love it

" An animated movie deserves watching
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,9,"After watching this movie, I feel that this movie is too fascinating. The whole feels very clean. The storyline will make you happy and moved. The favorite is the movie background inside. The super clean painting style makes people Very yearning and looks very comfortable. The clean background and simple dialogue, some small details and movements of the character, portray the character of the character very clearly. Moreover, the scenes depicted are very common, and the characters are also grounded. We can see that they are afraid and will be unrequited. Unlike some animated movies, they are very different from reality. This movie is very similar to the three-dimensional world, only the pictures shown Different then different ways. But the emotions in it are the real emotions in our lives, so it is very easy for you to watch an animated movie."

" The scene is beautiful but not enough to resonate
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,7,"As an animated film, its overall narrative is complete, the plot is rich, and the picture is beautiful, but I still feel that it is still imperfect. This may be because it is too deliberate in some places. In short, I don't think it can reach the realm that moved me."

And the last encounter at the end of the film has not passed by, it is finally gratifying. Xinhaicheng will not give the standard ending of fairy tales, but it gives us room for reverie.

Knot rope is an opportunity, dreams and forgetting are inevitable, dusk is an accident, can not be found. We are travelers of time, who have known each other for a long time, but have not yet met; time is like a knot, twining each other, maybe we are at both ends of the knot. Do not want to hide and seek in time, separated from you, but this world without you, there must be some kind of meaning of existence. Fortunately, the last three leaves and Taki met.

Must watch"
" Makes even a cynical person believe in the magic of love...
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,10,"Body swapping subgenre has mostly been used to make cute comedies which has very less to say. But Makoto Shinkai uses it to not only show love can be magical, but blends in the financial depression that youth has to face and the constant fear of natural disasters that the world faces everyday. The Visual Artistry is beyond amazing. This one should be seen by every Anime Lover."
" My pet likes this movie a lot even it's a bull !!!!
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,8,"When the movie came out, my family was made to go to the cinema by my bull' s force, the movie seemes a bit hopeless at the first 30 mins and it was getting better going by the plot. And the ending was spectacular with both the firework and the final scenes between the two, though my mom slept tight for the last."
" Magical
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,9,The best animation I've ever seen at any anime. It's a teenagers love story yet it will be relatable to most people. All of us at some point have looked for our soul mate and this movie explore that concept in a clever and original way.
" Great, but I liked A Silent Voice more
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,3,"This... This THING OVERSHADOWED A SILENT VOICE?!?!!? Okay, sorry I do really love this film. But if you want a anime that captures the beauty, heart, message and tears that anime is known for? Then watch the 2017 masterpiece, A Silent Voice."
" Awesome
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,9,"Looking at the cover I had thought its a simple romance movie but It really brought tears down from my eyes, it's a nice story and visual. I don't know why but anime series and movies give more feelings than the movies real people act."
" One of the best movies I have ever watched
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,10,This movie always remains in my heart. Story direction and animation at its best. A Beautiful scifi love story.
" There are massive plot holes in this one.
",2020-02-10 00:00:00,6,"At first I was enjoying watching this animation, it really appeals to your eye but not your brain. There are some ridiculous mistakes. How doesn't boy know the name of the place even though he can exactly draw the village? or how don't they know the time difference even though they use their phones quite a lot. Please not try to defend them like ""They were dreaming"". After realizing they are switching their bodies, they kinda gain their consciousness and they are even trying to not harm each other's lives and spending several days in each other's bodies. You must be dumb to not know the name of place you had been living for several days in someone's body or not realizing you shifted 3 years back and forth."
" Gem.
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,10,"I have seen this movie nearly 1 year ago, it was great but I knew that there are lot of things which I've missed, now that I have seen it so carefully, I can clearly say that this movie gives the best feels ever.
I have seen movies of 15+ languages but never came across such beautiful stuff.
Hats of to the creator Makoto Shinkai, it's so so so good that I can't even resist myself to write a review on ImDB."
" Lovely movie
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,9,"This Japanese animation movie is lovely and dreamy as it can get.If you are bored with regular clichéd rom-com, you should definitely give it a try.It is fresh, unpredictable and very satisfying.It tells the story about a high school boy in Tokyo and a high school girl in a rural town who suddenly and inexplicably begin to swap bodies.And if you think it is that simple then be prepared to be amazed as it gets crazy and somewhat sad midway.I loved the film very much and it gets me excited to watch other Japanese anime & movies which are usually more original, creative & interesting than Hollywood movies.There is already talks about Hollywood remake of Your Name but this one will always remain special."

" Indeed A Good Anime
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,9,"The story is interesting, the character development is done right and it is exotic and so beautifully drawn.Everyone is praising the legs of the main character but they forget that she is shorthaired like a boy. So it is not a straight 10/10."
" Inevitable
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,10,"Have you ever watched a movie for the first time and thought it was 'just good', but once you rewatch it, you finally realize that it's not just good, but near perfection. That's what happened when I watched Your Name. At first I just liked it because I had to constantly read the subtitles and understand the plot. But later on, I watched it for a second time, and started paying attention to certain details, like the animation, the performance of the voice actors, the likable characters, Japanese culture, but the best and most impressive one of all is the music by Radwimps. Their songs go so well in every scene in this movie, especially ""Sparkle"" in the final moments of the film. And that is one of the main reasons as to why this movie is a ""Masterpiece"" in my eyes. This movie is without a doubt the best animated film of all time, with Spirited Away a close second. It's such a shame that pathetic, lazy people from Hollywood just take ideas like this and start making their own versions. In the end, it doesn't matter, Disney will always be in the shadows of Japanese Anime. 10/10"
" I specifically wrote this review beacsue I am an adult
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,9,"And I very much enjoyed this anime. It is amusing, it is amazing and the story holds your attention.
Watch it because the girl and the female employee are eye candy to relish, the universe is so multi-faceted and detailed and I love the story."
" Touching breasts
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,5,"I chose this title because that is as close of a relationship the two characters have. Even in after a dramatic reveal the film refuses to let go of this gag.
The pacing is off: at first, it spends a lot of time showing the two main characters and seemingly allows the viewer to understand what's happening, bit then the film slaps the point in your face, grabs your arm and pulls you through 2 minutes of thick exposition that could've explored their unique relationship. It then reaches a reveal and a realization it undercuts with awkward humor and continues to focus on the teenage romance while keeping an inevitable and horrible natural disaster as a sub-plot as if two teenagers who never meet until the very end and doesn't know each other is more important for the targeted audience - the juxtaposition is comedic!
While the animation is beautiful as seen in for examples with apparent usage of rotoscope and the twilight-meeting, the awkward pacing and opening of the film makes me feel as if I'm watching a short-series cut into being a film. The forced music doesn't help as it gives me the impression this was cynically included for commercial success without making it contextualized and it even makes segments feel like music videos or AMVs.
Overall: good idea I wish had a clearer and more ""streamlined"" execution."

" Over-rated but good
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,7,"Granted that i have watched only a few anime movies in my life, but this is surely over-rated. It is good however and kept my attention. Te reviews are correct, but almost 9/10? That is a bridge too far.If the Hollywood types are remaking I can already tell it will fail."
" beautiful landscapes
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,9,Excellent story and beautiful landscapes makes this film a must watch.
" A masterpiece
",2020-01-14 00:00:00,10,"I've never been too big of an anime fan, but this movie is really a piece of art. Every aspect of this movie feels alive from the beginning to the end and that is something that is very hard to pull of in film, especially with animation. The characters, especially the two mains are perfect, great design, great personality, and great voice acting. The art work is phenomenal some of the best animation I have ever seen in my life.
The really beauty of this movie is in the story, at first it may seem a little stale and cliche but oh boy, does it really get filled with flavor, mainly in the 2nd and 3rd acts, which are nearly flawless.
No matter who you are, give this move a chance. I stumbled upon this movie as an accident and almost didn't watch it, but I can confidently say it's the best movie I've watched in a long time and would easily place it in my top 25 movies of all time."
" A heartwarming and fantastic story
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,10,"This has grown to be one of my favorite movies of all time and I never get tired of it. One particular thing I noticed in the movie is how different the first half of the movie is compared to the second. Almost like two stories in the same universe, which implies on how detailed, satisfying and important the animation, music and every line in the movie are. It is an astonishing experience and, surprisingly, in only 1.5 hours. This is very intriguing because the movie feels much more than that.The animation is absolutely beautiful and lovely to the naked eye. The music drags the viewers into something that is indescribable, something so deep and benevolent that it's hard to pinpoint where this feeling exactly emerges from. The movie connects the fundamentals of this world to the edge of our current time. Somewhere between the beauty in Japanese lakes, forests, mountains, ancient traditions and myths all the way to the breathtaking cityscapes of Tokyo, a love bond between a city-boy Taki and country-girl Mitsuha defines how powerful and important love could be, and how the beauty of our nature needs to be protected."
" Masterpiece

" full of grace
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,9,"This is a very delicate, gracefull way of movie making. it is full of nuances, human feelings, recognition of loss, recovery of interaction etc.i dont think it can be remade. i dont think the director of spider man can understand it and live in a world of heart of glass. all he could remake would be colossal, rude, krass mcdonals hamburger.i am really said to learn copyright owners sold its rights to the US."
" Your Name Remade And Set In USA Is For Losers
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,9,"This (the original) however is pretty damn good.In the hands of Japanese illustrators and animators Kimi No Na Wa is a great film and not just great animation. As it is, it's a good film for both teens and adults and that's certainly no small achievement."
" My favourite animated film
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,10,"I have seen a lot of anime and animated movies throughout my 30 years, and there are so many great films to recommend, but for me, Your Name is the crowning jewel. I can think of no other anime film that tops it.It is so beautiful in every way, truly a masterclass in creativity and humanity.Emotionally, it wrenched me and left my jaw dropped for much of the film.You simply must watch this on the best quality and largest screen you can find. It's a feast for the senses, and just go in blind without any foreknowledge."
" Speechless
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,9,"Absolutely amazing. I love this movie so much everything about it is totally breathtaking, the visuals, story, emotions...the love between the two main characters is so evident despite not having even met one another! This movie is seriously so great, I know for a fact I could rewatch it over 10 times, and I plan to. It's touching and really makes you think about the people you're connected to in life. The only reason I rate this under 10 is because the middle-to-end did confuse me a little bit, and I had to research the meaning of it afterwards, but it didn't take away from any enjoyment, and who knows? Maybe I'm just dumb😅 But...if you needed a sign to tell you to watch this movie...THIS IS IT! WATCH IT!!!"
" Incredible
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,10,"It's the most emotionally affecting movie I've ever experienced.The first time I watched it, I cried at the end because it was so beautiful.The second time I watched it, I cried for last half of the movie. I knew the heartrending finale was coming, and that made every action that preceded it more significant emotionally. I had try to my best to hide my tears from my gf so that she wasn't all, ""why you crying? is something about to happen?"" I didn't want to ruin it for her.I'll probably watch it again in two or three years, when time has allowed my memory to forget some of the twists, and I'll cry all over again."
" Impressive and entertaining
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,8,"I am not an anime or animation in general fan or expert, but I was quite impressed by this Bluray. It is a work of art and the palate, story, humanity of it were really impressive.I was also impressed by how much freer and more progressive Japan is. The breasts, legs and shot skirts are so pretty and cute. I think I fell in love with the main girl and the lady co-worker who takes off her skirt.Why am I giving this an 8 I should really move up to 9"
" Not just a great anime, but a great film

",2020-01-01 00:00:00,10,To be honest I'm not into an anime type of movie but I got curious when I saw almost all of my classmates are into this so because of my curiosity I've decided to watch your name and holy fudge! I must say this movie became my all time favorite movie (not kidding) and I highly recommend this to you guys!
" So beautiful!
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,10,"This movie was so beautiful and emotional. The plot may seem typical but it was for me, unpredictable. This is a story of boy and girl who switches body and live each others lives in different city and there are funny happenings during this.Shred some tears and watched this at least three times. Beautiful music and lovely voice actors!Trully recommend to watch the original first before seeing the Hollywood version:)"
" Beautiful

" Creative and stunning but...
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,6,"The animation in this movie is absolutely stunning. The creative twist on the red string of fate also captured my attention.However, I found the characters underdeveloped. They had little personality to them. In a movie supposedly meant to move you, I did not root for the characters to prevail or even relate to the characters. For that reason, I couldn't give this movie a higher rating.However, it is an absolutely stunning movie, and I throughly enjoyed the more ""movie montage"" moments and the corresponding music."
" Doesn't matter whether you like animes.
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,10,"It's simply great. A little bit funny, a little bit teeny, a little beat of Sandra Bullock and a nice analogy on some moments in Japans history. Awesome."
" The best animation movie
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,10,"The title of the movie is « Kimi no na wa » in Japon and « your name » in French and English. The girl, Mitsuha, and the boy, Taki. Mitsuha born in Itomori and Taki born in Tokyo. Taki and Mitsuha fall in love, and I think this is so cute.
Mitsuha, she is dreaming in Tokyo but in her dreams she's a boy. And Taki dreaming he is a girl,I dont't know why.
This translatin, I was suprised by the translation between Mitsuha and Taki. But one day the comet crossing the atmosphere then the comet destroy them in a tausend pieces an one of the comet smashed into a thausend piece lands in the city Itomori. I cried in this passage because Mitsuha is dead. This movie moved me because this movie it's so sad, but it ends well and I love it because I love animation movies.
The voices of actress ans actors are verry verry good. The punctuation it was fantastic and the translation of the voices and the moment the character of the animation speaks. The voices and the animation was really realistically or realistic. The voices is really real for this movie. I felt a feeling through the voices. If you like animation, drama and romance movies, you should watched this movie in streaming."
" Wonderful movie
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,10,I first watched this anime at one of my anime conventions. I wasn't sure what to expect but have to say it has become one of my favorites. I don't want to spoil anything but I think you will love it too. The animation and dialog is superb. I highly suggest it as a very good anime for a first timer. And please feel free to let me know what you think of it too.
" Okay, I didn't expect that.
",2019-12-15 00:00:00,10,"Its 12 AM, I usually sleep by 10 pm but today I'm feeling a little frisky. I'm a true cinema lover but today I decided to watch an anime movie. Before this the only animated movie that amazed me beyond my 0 expectations was 'Into the spiderverse'. Have only seen one anime that is 'Death Note' a classic. So I start this movie, it's going nice and fun. Peppy and cute but slowly it moves forward and it blows my mind. Don't want to spoil this for anyone at any cost but my heart sank after a long long time. I think I resonated a lot with the characters. Their agony, their pan and helplessness. It broke something in me. I loved this movie. The characters were written perfectly and yes not that cliché. It wad lovable and pretty and I don't know about others but I really really connected with the plot. I have lost my true love so I know what it means to feel that pain.
Overall a brilliant movie. I went in with 0 expectations and even with some hesitations and now I'm just here sad and happy at the same time."
" A heart touching movie

" Your Name is a fantastic escape into a dreamlike world that shows us the beauty of our own
",2019-11-28 00:00:00,9,"Ever since its conception, storytelling has been used as a means of escapism. With its characters and settings brought to life in another reality, we are able to be transported from our everyday lives into something more spectacular. At its core, Your Name is all about this idea of escape. From its whimsical storyline to its otherworldly atmosphere, the entire movie feels like a fantastical dream. And an absolutely incredible one at that.STORY - 8.2/10While it takes place in the very real setting of modern-day Japan, the story is packed with supernatural elements. Just like a dream, you start off not really knowing what's going on. But soon enough everything starts to naturally unfold, managing to consistently maintain interest in its entire 2 hour runtime. There are also some really well done plot twists and moments of tension littered throughout, which I honestly wasn't expecting from a high school romance movie. On top of all that, there's a solid layer of depth that explores our connections with the world and the people around us. There are of course some minor flaws, like how explanations for the supernatural elements are mostly brushed over. But while it's nothing groundbreaking, Your Name's storyline is definitely a fascinating one from beginning to end.CHARACTERS - 6.5/10If there's a weak link in this movie, it'd have to be the characters. They aren't bad; in fact the personalities and interests of the two leads Mitsuha and Taki are explored quite well in the beginning of the movie. But there's really not much depth to those personalities, which leads to some shallow character development from both. Similarly, the supporting characters feel just like supporting characters - nothing much more than devices to move the plot forward. Having said all that, the movie somehow manages to really make us care about its characters. It's tons of fun to see them go through dreamlike journeys of their own, much like the audience's own dreamlike experience when watching. Their feelings start to become your feelings. Their desires become your desires. This was especially true for me near the end of the movie, where I wished with every fiber of my being for a happy ending for the characters.ART - 9.8/10Though its story is largely supernatural, through its visuals is where Your Name truly leaves the boundaries of reality to become something else. The hand-drawn art is stunning, and every single frame of the movie is more than wallpaper worthy. The animation is buttery smooth, with everything flowing, bouncing, or panning in the most satisfying way possible. The cinematography is breathtaking, utilizing ultra wide shots to create a massive sense of scope and beauty. And the movie is filled with visual symbolism in every nook and cranny, adding even more meaning to an already rich story. All of these aspects combine together in the best way possible to create a dreamlike atmosphere nothing short of ethereal.SOUND - 8.7/10The soundtrack only helps add to the atmosphere, beautifully complimenting every scene that its used in. Some tracks that particularly stand out are ""Sparkle"", ""Zenzenzense"", and ""Again to Goshintai"", all of which give me chills on demand. A minor complaint is that the soundtrack mostly just sounds pretty without adding much meaning to the story or its characters, but its still plenty enough to elevate the entire movie to a higher level of emotion. There are also some great sound effects that really help add to certain scenes, like a dramatic bell or a chorus of wailing whales. There's a particularly amazing scene which uses complete silence to turn something already spectacular into a borderline masterpiece. And as you'd expect from a fairly high budget movie like this, the voice acting is on point and does not at all detract from the immersion.OVERALL ENJOYMENT - 9.2/10I've said it before and I'll say it again, this movie feels exactly like a beautiful dream. Every time I watch it, I feel truly disconnected from the real world and absorbed into one more beautiful, innocent, and happy. And at the end of the day, that's exactly why I watch anime, go to movies, listen to music, or consume any type of media - to feel a sense of happiness that I can't get from reality. And in this sense, Your Name is an overwhelming success."
" Masterpiece & lovely movie 💞

" A story what can change your viewing perception
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,10,"Some movies can touch anybody's heart and ""Your name'' is one of the best in heart touching movie. When I saw this my mind refreshes. It changed my perception of thinking a story. When Mitshua died it touches my mind. I felt an unknown emotion but end time my mind gets a joy.
Thanks everyone for making THIS type of movie."
" A beautifully animated, but ultimatly empty movie.
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,7,"Your Name takes a great setup, and does the bare minumum with it. Without the proper character development the story falls flat and the emotional weight feels lacking. Its still an enjoyable movie with a basic, but serviceable plot. But so much more could have been done with this. The animation alone is enough for me to recommend it. Just dont expect there to be much substance behind the pretty pictures."
" Breathtaking!
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,9,"This is some of the most beautiful animation you will ever see in a film. The character development is extremely strong with you rooting the leads on throughout this magnificently told story. A+ for creative plot execution and an excellent pick for all audiences, not just for those who love anime!"
" Breathtaking animation. Simplistic storyline.
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,7,"The animation is top-notched. The sceneries and images are simply breathtaking. The premise of the story is interesting enough, but pretty much linear. It is an intriguing story but not the type that is stuck in your head after weeks of watching for it raises no philosophical questions or contains any life messages. There is no depth or complexity to the story. This is no Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, and to see it having as high ratings as the latter disappoints me."
" One of the best anime I've ever seen
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,8,"This is simply one of the best anime I've ever seen. It teach about pure love between human, not much dramatized like Hollywood movie"
" Superb!
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,6,"Uhm...wow! Another exceptional animated film from Japan. The animation is stunning! You certainly haven't experienced animated films until you've watched an animated film from Japan. They are so different to the Hollywood films.This film is loaded with emotional depth and creativity. Although it is never explained how the characters managed to switch places, it really becomes immaterial once you follow the story. Around the halfway mark the film shocks us with an unexpected natural disaster that I never saw coming. From there on the film reverses, going back before the disaster, but this is when the film becomes more interesting. Since we are now aware of the impending doom, everything has more meaning.'Your Name.' is a sad, beautiful, uplifting film you have to experience at least once."
" Looking for a good romantic movie?
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,10,"If you are looking for a good romantic movie,you won't get better than this.I am not a fan of romantic movies but to say honestly its one of my most favourite movies.I bet it will take your breath away."
" Beautiful movie
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,8,"I heard about your name. from a friend and decided to finally see it. And now I have to give it high praise for what it did. First of all, the animation. It's gorgeous. The lighting, the character design, movement, the backgrounds. It's all amazing okay? Now I thought the voice acting was great too, which may be hard to believe (cuz I prefer dub), but I'm serious, they did a good job. The story is also pretty interesting. How are they switching bodies? The answer isn't very clear, but that's fine because the movie also has a lot of good character moments. They actually grow overtime. And the music is pretty good.8.8/10 (Great)"
" Nice Movie
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,8,Of you like anime you should watch this i reccomend this
" One of the most beautiful animation
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,9,"I saw this movie in original language, because my native language is Japanese. So, I inform you in advance that my review may contains a lot of grammatical mistakes. But try reading my review!This is the story depicting the meeting of two Japanese, Taki and Mitsuha. Taki lives in Tokyo, the capital of Japan. In other hands, Mitsuha lives in Nagano, one of the most rural area of Japan. One they, both wake up to notice that there body has exchanged. Through this event, they know each other. As they know each other in depth, they come to meet in direct. In this process, Taki found that Mitsuha dies three years ago because of meteor strikes. Taki and Mitsuha use ""Musubi"", connection between them, to save Mitsuha and her villages' people.This is the overall of this film.(I think you should refer Wikipedia )What makes this film special one (to me) are musics, graphics and of course this unforgettable story.
Four inserted songs by Radwips makes me more emotional than any other films. In Particular, the scene of ""Nandemonaiya"" makes me cry every time. I thank for staffs of this films that enable us to see the meeting of Mitsuha and Taki.
Graphics is awesome. In Shinkai' films we can see the beauty of nature, cities and people. They search our ourld deeply and express exactly what they see. ""Miyamizu Shrine"", Tokyo, The lives of Taki and Mitsuha, and so on, Everything is beautiful.I really appreciate this film. One of my favorite. Thanks."
" My least favorite movie of all time
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,1,"I could talk for hours about why I hate this film, but seeing as I don't want to sound pretentious, I'll just say that the story and flow of the movie just feels like they are just going through the beats and not like its an actual adventure or story. The writing is atrocious, the jokes aren't funny, and the characters are dreadful and unlikable. Thank GOD the animation is beautiful, the voice acting is fine, and the music is good. But over all, you know you messed up when you make your audience scream at there phone while watching it."

" Logical Miss
",2019-10-07 00:00:00,5,"Till today, I still dont understand why Taki would write down the big SUKI rather than tell Mitsuba his real name. There was no denying that the works on this film are beautiful, but I cant accept the missing logic."
" Worthy
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,10,I was in search of movies like this and got a perfect emotional feeling at it's best and i loved it...
" Utterly amazing
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,10,"Makoto Shinkai is a director who I've always found intriguing. Even when I didn't care for his works I always felt there was a unique vision there, but it wasn't until 2013's Garden of Words that I felt he had truly been able to satisfactorily express that vision.Your Name, though, is the movie it was all leading up to. Once again Shinkai is concerned with distance and connection. Here, two young people keep switching bodies and living bits of one another's lives. Much of the first half of the film is a light comedy about the wackiness of such a life, but the story deepens and the movie becomes wonderfully suspenseful and touching.At this point, Shinkai has complete control of his craft. Visually the movie is utterly stunning, with absolutely breathtaking moments. The story draws you in slowly and believably. The characters are engaging, the pacing perfect, every moment just what it should be.Watch it."

" The best
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,10,"BEST ANIME MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.
PS. BOYCOTT THE REMAKE"
" A beautiful film with a band blasting their music into your ears.
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,8,"Probably due to how lame and unentertaining these types of movies are, I tend to avoid movies that involve body swaps like a plague. What Shinkai Makoto did here with the story really was impressive as he added a bit of a twist to it and making a very cohesive and entertaining story. Makoto has a very unique style from the other current Japanese animators by providing films that are absolutely beautiful to look at, such as the landscapes and sceneries. He mixed these beautiful scenes with a surprisingly interesting story by having two interesting characters and for us to see them experience what is going on as they constantly swap bodies back and forth. I liked how the movie doesn't focus on certain tropes and used the comedic moments effectively. You understand who they are and end up liking both of them by the end of the film. Also, the twist that I've mentioned earlier is surprising and introduces a stake for these characters to overcome. This is where the emotional part hits extremely well as you end up cheering for them and you hope that everything will work out with them in the end.The voice acting was surprisingly good, especially as the actors who voiced the main roles are not professionally trained voice actors. Both Kamiki Ryunosuka and Kamishiraishi Mone gave so much personality to their characters and were able to act emotional and funny when it was needed.Not everything I have to say is positive as there were a few things that did have me not enjoy as much as other people have. First off, as much as I liked the characters, after a certain point, the movie takes a comedic route by going into a montage and the film skips over a few consequences or ends subplots that were introduced at the beginning of the film so quickly to the point where it felt like it wasn't necessary. I wanted to see more of a conclusion, instead of a quick scene to show to know that some problems are resolved and will never come back.One of the major complaints is that parts of the film felt like I am sitting at a park, enjoying the scenery with someone dear to me, when suddenly, a band pops out of the bushes and starts singing their songs a couple of centimeters away from me. The band, Radwimps, did a great job and made a good soundtrack. However, just like in a lot of Japanese films and dramas, they tend to go very melodramatic and they add the music at the right time to sell their soundtrack, along with forcing people to feel a certain emotion. I instantly got annoyed when they started the movie with an anime style opening and would blast up their music so high that I couldn't focus or hear what the characters were saying. This would happen constantly throughout the film to the point that it got distracting and I wanted to plug my ears until the song had finished.Despite what I said, I'm pretty sure there are people out there that don't mind those kind of things and they would enjoy the movie more. I personally don't like and still enjoyed it overall. I'm glad this movie was a big hit as we will be able to see more top quality animation from Makoto."
" One of the best anime movie ever created.
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,8,"This anime will exceed you expectations. As an anime lover, I love how Makoto Shinkai incorporates his past experiences and learnings into making this movie. The characters are vividly represented. The culture and belief of Japanese people are deeply intertwined. The more you watch this movie, the more you will deeply immense into it. Highly recommended!"
" Deserves to be rewatch
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,10,The movie is not exactly the type where most people will understand in one sitting. Rewatching this masterpiece adds up so much details. The small details about the timeline of the two protagonists proves how a quality this movie is.
" nice movie with great storyline and animation
",2019-08-31 00:00:00,10,"Your Name
Your Name is just a good movie. This movie felt long,
but not too long. All the way through, I was asking
what would happen next. It was clever, emotional,
and left me crying after the movie. The twist was
done really well, and I almost wanted to pause the
movie. Also, the animation is gorgeous. You get to
see detailed images from many angles and
perspectives, and there were hundreds of animators!
The credits didn't start out with the cast like it usually
would. The first thing you saw after a black screen
was hundreds of names of animators and designers.

ready to let tears out. I would not recommend this

" Beautiful and surprising
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,9,"I'm not a writer or film reviewer by any stretch of the imagination so consider yourself fore warned.This movie caught my eye on netflix months ago and I always passed it by because honestly it looked like a romantic drama and I wasn't really interested. Eventually I kind of ran out of things to watch and though I'd give it a go.Instantly the premise was interesting if a little ""done"" but the characters were likable and the animation was beautiful so I kind of let it go.Where this film ultimately goes surprised the hell out of me when I watched it but now that I think about it there are several other films and shows that play with similar ideas. I suppose its the mixing of the two different ideas (body swap and time) that caught me off guard at the time.An amazing beautiful film that's recommendation is hampered only by its being anime. There are people I know that would love this film if it were live action and simply will not watch it because its anime."
" Hands down best anime romance ever made.
",2019-08-27 00:00:00,10,"I think most reviewers have echoed what I would say already, but I will just say the hype for this movie is definitely justified. I do not cry during movies, especially animated ones. But I found that after the movie ended my wife in I were in tears. Not because it's sad by any means, but because the movie and story itself is just so beautiful.I'm so glad I impulsively bought this when it was on sale. Give it a watch and see for yourself. You wont regret it."
" Just amazing!
",2019-08-27 00:00:00,10,"I don't watch anime but my friend recommended this movie, and its been a week now since I last watched it and I still can't move on how good it is. I love the story, the animation and the soundtrack! Although, I did not cry watching this film, the sadness it portrays still affect me to this day - the longing for someone that does not exist, the nostalgia, all the feels!"
" An amazing animation

" Haven't been touched so much by an anime movie since Spirited Away!
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,10,"Going into this film I knew the last scene. And that was because a problem I had with a subtitle so I had to check the last phrase of dialogue to make sure it was fully synchronized. Even though having that in my mind I cried 3 times while watching this movie. I can honestly say it was one of the best movie experiences I've ever had in my life. I haven't been so moved (at least by an anime movie) ever since I saw Spirited Away.The plot of this movie is pretty simple and the movie lets you know it from the first minute. Having said that there is so much going on and the pacing of the movie was so good, that the 1 hour and 46 minutes flew by without even noticing it. The first act was a bit more funny as the two tried to find balance within this weird situation. The second and third act however were where things begin to fall apart and quite fantastic things happen that move you, inspire you, touch you, surprise you and maybe even shock you. The funny thing about watching this movie and about my experience watching this movie is that about two years ago I've read a very interesting book about relationships and how to have a good relationship (I mean as a couple). One of the main things that stood out to me from that book was this thing: ""Love your future partner even before you met him"". And I don't know why, but while I was watching this movie I was reminded of that. For me this movie reminded me of the fact that even though you might not yet have found THAT partner, It will come and when it comes be ready to already love him and pursue that dream of being with him/her.As for technical aspects of the movie, I was astonished with how good was the animation even though it was hand made, at times some shots looked like a short real video. Absolutely stunning animation. The music was also incredible with an amazing soundtrack (musical score) and also songs with voice that were hart breaking especially due to the fact that the scenes they were in were superb as well.I can't find a single flaw with this movie. The only thing that bugged me a little was the complexity of the story especially from the second to third act. Aside from that this movie was superb in every way and it is the kind of movie that reminds us about beautiful things in life and how we can achieve those things if we pursue them and love them. 10/10"

" A wondrous experience.
",2019-08-08 00:00:00,9,"Your Name (2016)
At its heart it's a Japanese body swap comedy drama, but there's a hell of a lot more to it than that. Our boy Taki lives in Tokyo and girl Mitsuha hails from a rural village. There are genuine moments of humour as the two teenagers wake up in each other bodies for a day at a time, a couple of times a week. They return to ""themselves"" after going asleep with no memory and they try and piece together the previous day with notes left of each others phones and tales recounted by friends.
All in all seemingly a slight twist on a conventional premise but the plot becomes layered by celestial occurrences, time disparities and tragedy. What sounds complicated is wonderfully drip fed and tangible and makes for a compelling tale. The characters and friends have a warmth to them and you'll care about them.
As good as everything sounds so far the most enthralling thing is the animation. It's is right up there with the most beautiful movies i've ever seen. The village and surrounds are exquisite. The details are remarkable. The bustle and movement of Tokyo are magnificently rendered. It genuinely blurs the lines of animation and reality.
This movie is worthy of every acclaim and to be as outstandingly successful as it was in it's homeland. NINE"

" Before Watching: Your Name / Kimi no na wa (2016)
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,8,"""Your Name"" (2016) is an anime about love, Japanese culture, and... body-swapping? It is great, and if you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:This movie requires a few things from you as a viewer, although mainly in two different ways. The first half spends most of it's time in a Japanese village, where certain traditions, rituals and items are presented - such as Kuchikamizake and the concept of braiding and twilight. The more insight one has about these things, the more complete do they seem inside the plot, as their themes correlate exquisitely to the movie's main theme. The movie is nevertheless highly enjoyable without above-average knowledge about these things.The second half goes pretty plot-heavy. This is where attention to the first half pays off, as the complexity opens a whole different layer of emotional and intellectual satisfaction. Don't stress if you don't get everything at once, instead rejoice over a great film that rewards you for additional viewings. With Your Name, you don't pay attention - you invest it.A small footnote that should be mentioned is that some of the humor is a bit over-the-top adolescent, and there are a few jokes about breasts and crotch areas. Sensitive watchers might find this a bit annoying, but it could also be argued that it plays well into the charms of the movie.Last but certainly not least, this movie is breathtakingly gorgeous. The shots are pure bliss and the beauty presented is all too rare. The light, colors, and surroundings beg for as many inches of a screen as you can get hold of. If you don't own a Blu-ray player, movies like this makes the price worth it.My personal grade: a phenomenal 8/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."

" Not bad, but...
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,5,"The movie, in general, is good and entertaining, but being strict, its plot is totally disappointing.
It's visually stunning, nothing more, nothing less. It lacks an actual message and it has plenty of unnecessary scenes which seem to be there just for the sake of teenager fanservice. It isn't dramatically touching either. Just another pointless interpretation of the already seen body-switching concept.
It's certainly overrated. Sadly, it's a total waste of visual resources. Hadn't it been for its popularity, I would already have forgotten about it.
I'd actually give it a 7.5 out of 10, but I'm rating it a bit lower to compensate for other reviews which depict it as the best anime movie ever."
" Switching
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,8,"You get thrown into this and you have to figure out what is what. Unless you know the source material and/or read synopsis of the movie of course. I hadn't so some of the stuff came as a surprise but there is a lightness at the beginning of it, which switches or changes gear throughout the movie. I wouldn't go as far as to say ""forget Disney"". There's a different audience and a different feel to this movie for sure, why not have both? Instead of viewing something negatively take in the positive.Animation is not everyones cup of tea, but if you have no issues with it, this is quite the ride with two characters and a lot of fantasy and drama thrown into the mix. It really is something and the repurcussions are felt ... and heavy"

" 6.5, alright to watch once but not rewatch
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,6,"I overall enjoyed this movie, but after hearing great things it fell flat. Even if I hadn't had any previous knowledge of this movie I still would find it underwhelming.PROS: A decent anime film for people that don't have anything better to compare it too. It's inoffensive/family friendly and enjoyable enough. The natural backgrounds and cityscapes in the film were gorgeous. Once you watch it you won't have to wonder what all the hype is about.CONS: Some of the ideas in the movie presented themselves as if they'd be really complex and interesting, but everything played out in an uninspired way. The two main characters were supposed to be in love, yet there was barely any development there. We never really saw them get to know each other or understood why they even felt anything for one another. There are ways this movie could've done the soulmate trope without making the relationship feel under developed. Also I found the character design to be unappealing, and the random breaks within the narrative to deliver mini music videos seemed like a weird editing choice.If you're looking for a fresh emotional movie with complex characters and an interesting love story this is not it. Watch ""A Silent Voice"" instead. Or any Hayao Miyazaki film.TL;DR: just okay, kinda nice but lacks real heart."
" Overrated

",2019-06-21 00:00:00,10,"I watched this movie this morning as I awoke after I had my terrible injury fixed the evening prior. This movie was inspiring, heavy and yet light, and truly filled with such emotion that it helped me break free, at least temporarily, from the heaviness of the anger and hatred that I held in my heart. It made me feel like hope wasnt a waste of time and what i'm looking for, whatever that is, can be found. The film kept me in suspense and was always interesting even in the times of normality in the film where the characters were just living their lives. Please if you haven't seen this film I implore you to do so now if you are sad or angry or even if you are perfectly happy and looking to continue on your path through life."

" The Most Emotional Anime Movie I've ever seen!
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,9,"Your Name was already released in cinema in 2016 but I knew and watched it in 2017. The genre of this movie is romance, but it combines with mystery, supernatural, and little bit comedy. The romantic scenes that shown in this movie is not too excessive, but can make the viewers fall in love with it, like me.The movie shows some places in Tokyo that the main character named Taki lives. Those places are made as similar as in real Tokyo. The movie also never forget to add Japan cultures in the story. It just like the girl named Mitsuha do. In her village culture, she must make an alcohol kuchikami-zake. The fireworks festival that annually held in Japan is shown in this movie.This anime movie gives a big emotional impact to the viewers. For you who have not watch this movie before, you should prepare your heart. Because in the middle until the end of the story, you will get some scenes that can drain your emotion. Even some viewers are crying when they watch it. The sound effect is also make this movie feel alive. The soundtracks are success to bring more emotional feeling to viewers by the instrument and the meaning of the songs that have a deep meaning.The mystery and supernatural side of this movie has shown with how the body of Mitsuha and Taki can be switched despite different place and time. On the comedy side is when they do their activities with that switched body. This movie success to beat other movies that had popular before such as Spirited Away, 5cm per Second and many more. Overall this is the most emotional movie anime I've ever seen! And actually after I watch this movie, I can't move on to other movies until now!"
" Animation
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,7,It's a good animation movie but it can be done without animation which is from my point of view the main idea of animation movies that they picture what normal movies can't.

",2019-04-05 00:00:00,7,"Not as magical as hayao miyazaki's other masterpieces.It's just an animated, scifi & romcom version of j-drama I'd a say. I used to be a j-drama fan but people move on to k-dramas which makes better tv series & also films compare to japan nowadays.1 thing I'm impressed of the hero or typical japan hero's journey, they'd do anything against all odds to achieve the goals for the loved ones. Like the tragic death of lalaru from anime ""now and then, here and there"" after shu trying so hard to save her. This movie did the same & the hero rewrites history, luckily the boy in the girl's body didn't cry wolf to save them all. It's kind of weird nobody heard of the town hit by the asteroid #plottwistWhy i watched this movie? I was single & longed for ala j-drama love story.Why i kinda hate it? I was in japan, not as fun as watching j-drama & that time neighbors next to a bnb i booked wasn't available, the old guy said ""i cannot understand English"". The ending like spirited away's ending the dragon kid, haku... What became of of the haku??? Now this movie, taki & mitsuha??? They finally got to meet face-to-face (happily ever after) & it's up to us to make up their next story?????Why i kinda like it? I don't want to end up in a tragic death by asteroid, proposed the girl I've had known for 13 years."

I know that Kimi No Na Wa made a lot of money so therefore I know automatically that the remake will come and it will be a Hollywood con job (think Ghost In The Shell SHUDDER).Kimi No Na Wa to me is an extremely well written and well thought story with amazing visuals.

The answer is, the most beautiful film I have seen since I was a child. It starts with the lovely characters and ends with the amazing animation that will guide you through a perfect story for anyone who loves a bit of a twist in the storyline. I think the movie deserves a metaphorical approach: It's like a star in the universe only you and your loved one can see, no matter how far apart the loving souls are."

" A Gorgeous and Moving Tale, with Complex Yet Powerful Ideas
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,9,"This movie was to me one of the biggest surprises of my life; when I heard that the story was about body-swapping, I never expected it to be original or even remotely entertaining. Then I listened to Chris Stuckmann's review of it on youtube, who gave such high praise that I couldn't help but be curious enough to check it out. I was absolutely mesmerized by the end, and am still quite convinced that this is the best animated movie I have ever seen! And I have seen quite a few.Voice Acting:
Both Ryûnosuke Kamiki and Mone Kamishiraishi are excellent. I only watched the original version, and although they are not that different from most Japanese voice actors, they still do a very good job in conveying both frustration and longing and grief. The supporting cast is hardly noteworthy, aside from doing fine in the voice department. Mostly because pretty much all the focus is on the two main protagonists.Animation:
This movie. Is absolutely gorgeous. Before this, I had never seen such a realistic depiction of our world in anime as this one. The modern town of Tokio looks fantastic and you'd want to book a flight immediately to just walk there in awe. The level of detail is just stunning. The same goes for the lighting, making excellent use of different stages of the sun over the day for beautiful sunsets and lensflares, painting the characters and backgrounds. The characters themselves are also very impressive, particulary how their movements and subtle gestures portray their emotional states.Music:
It's surprising how little music actually is in this movie, but the few cues that come up are very effective and add a lot of immediate weight.Plot:
This is perhaps the best aspect about this movie. Without spoiling anything, this movie pulls several twists and turns on the body-swap storyline that you absolutely wouldn't expect, but if you already know, you'd be amazed at how tricky the writing and crafting is that went into this picture. Information is revealed at the right moments to make the most shocking revelations for both the protagonists and the audience the most impactful. The ending is a bit wonky because of how sudden things are established after the conflict, but the final shot will possibly leave you with tears.Tone:
Another reason why this movie works so well. The direction is pretty subtle and allows for breathing room to attach to the characters in certain emotional moments. Sudden silence is often used to great effect, as well as montages. At a certain point, you want everything that these characters are chasing after, and you are in despair when they are when they find that it is pretty much impossible. It is incredibly effective storytelling and direction.General concensus:
Looking back at what I wrote, initially there doesn't appear to be much that makes this worthy of being the best animated movie of all time. But this is a gradual process, and by the time the credits role, the brilliance of it is solidly established. It is very grounded and fantastical at the same time, looks gorgeous, and becomes incredibly compelling. 8.7/10"
" Breath Taking
",2019-03-14 00:00:00,10,"Your Name was a movie I watched on a plane over to Sweden, and I was obsessed with finding a way to watch it at home afterwards. The plot is engaging, the characters are well developed, and the animation is crisp with talent. The interactions of characters with the story arc take your breath away, at least from a writer's standpoint.I would recommend that anyone who enjoy anime, romance, tear jerkers, and/or bitter sweet films to watch this the second they have the chance."
" Your name
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,10,It was very sweet. I liked how the characters were blue to connect and the twist at the end. I wish we could see why happened after but I am sad it didn't show. Though that fact adds mystery to the plot.
" Beautiful film
",2019-03-11 00:00:00,8,Very beautiful both in story and visuals. A great film that moves you and leaves you very satisfied
" A Pastermiece.
",2019-03-11 00:00:00,10,"Mitsuha destroyed the past and went to the big City. Because of someone who shares this history, she was able to go back and save what matters to her. The Village is not a place. As a millennial forum rat the title translates into ""you are name"". Since this happens continuously for all of the youth who flare into unruly comets the time is able to bend and it takes an elder to see how the events are unfolded and to have the patience of weaving and helping the youth to find themselves. 10/10IMDB. Bring back the comment section. 1/10"
" This is a Masterpiece.
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,10,"I'm speechless after I saw this movie. I never write a review. But after watching this movie I was not able to control Myself. Usually I ingnore anime based on Lovestory. BUT this anime was on time travel so I watched it. & seriously it was mind-blowing & heart warming. The background music, songs, concept, screenplay, dialogues everything in this movie is just awesome. Hats off to all people who worked & created this movie."
" Poorly edited - visually disappointing
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,4,"I am a great anime fan and bought the BluRay edition of this film on the strength of the strong reviews on this and other sites. Having been spoilt by the visual quality of the studio Ghibli films, I assumed 'Your Name' would be of the same standard.Was I disappointed! I found Your Name to be unwatchable 10 minutes in. I persevered and watched it right to the end. I ended up feeling irritated with the visual imprecision, annoyed with myself that I bought it, wondered if this was a defective copy. I don't like scene after scene with blurry, unfocussed edges and centre focus only, I don't like washed out colours, faded clarity of line, image looking like it's been filmed though gauze, use of what appear to be incomplete drafts rather than completed images. Part of the enjoyment of watching individual cell animation is the precision and colours that you simply don't get with 'real film'. Don't expect that here.Most of the reviews here are of the storyline, and comment on the visuals, if at all, in general terms. Film is a visual medium. No amount of brilliant story line can compensate for inferior visuals. And in this day and age there is no longer any excuse for poor visuals.I'm most disappointed in this film, I really expected a highly competent visual performance to justify an interesting story. I give it 4 stars of the basis of the few brief undistorted visuals which made it past the editing process. If you're not Into visuals, close your eyes and let it run as the story has interesting moments. If you are into visuals, probably give it a miss."
" ""Your Name"": A Masterclass in Animation
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,10,"""Your Name"" is the latest film of Japanese writer-director Makoto Shinkai. This is definitely the greatest anime of all time, and to earn that title it had to beat other superb films, for example ""Wolf Children"". This movie is addictively compelling the whole way through due to the storyline's constant direction change and thematical elements.The story begins with Mitsuha, a girl living in a small Japanese town. She finds life miserable there, so on one night she wishes to swap bodies with a handsome Tokyo boy. The following day, that very thing happens inexplicably with a boy named Taki.The animation in this film is just simply beautiful. You could see that with every frame, the animators articulately put everything on screen with such care that it felt almost as if it were in real life. There's also a time lapse scene, which would've been really difficult to execute, but the way it is shown it's as if the animators did it with ease. The storyline is one of the best in movie history; completely unpredictable, clever and you could really invest in the characters it documented. The whole way through the story gets better and better, to the point where you're lusting for more. And the ending beautifully concludes the rest of this excellent film due to its shock and emotion.""Your Name"" is the ultimate animated film ans shows anime at its true best. It's a spectacle everybody needs to see, even if you don't like anime. Incredible animation, excellent soundtrack and a near-flawless script make ""Your Name"" a masterclass in animation.Rating: 9.7/10Grade: A+"
" Probably the best movie I have seen so far
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,10,This Movie touched something in my heart that I don't even know was there. If you read this Review. Pls view the Movie. Then you will know what I mean. It is a masterpiece.
" Highly original, creative, and emotionally effective
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,10,"Your Name. starts off treading familiar romantic comedy grounds with a slight magical realism twist that anime fans would also find familiar. But the lighthearted love story that it promises takes a second-act left turn into Kafkaesque territory with sudden plot twists and reveals that create incredible emotional weight and dramatic tension. The characters are well developed, the story is sophisticated, and the themes of gender, trust, and love as a connective force are handled deftly if sometimes unsubtly. It's weird enough that it won't win over anime skeptics and others might criticize the way it plays with narrative structure, but it deserves consideration as the best film of 2016."
" Right up there with the best of Studio Ghibli movie
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,10,As a new anime otaku I was interested in the plot. And after getting the English dub from the library I soon fell in love with this spectacular movie. It quickly reminded me of Studio Ghibli's movies. And after several months of watching I still get ready eyed while listening to the soundtrack. Radwimps is an amazing artist. I hope that the live action movie does this movie justice.
" AMAZING ANIME ...but the story lacks originality
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,7,"Dont great me wrong i loved this anime! i loved the art work, the sound track and how well it was all directed. What i cannot over look was the fact that they both used the other phones to keep track of what they did and neither of them noticed the year? REALLY?
It was basically lake house....but better!
Definitely one for the MUST WATCH list"
" The story is so mess
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,6,See this grade. I doubt the grade real. I think this story is mess and express is not touching.
" My favourite movie of all time
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,10,"Animated movies don't get much better than this.STORY & MAIN CHARACTERSIn ""Your name"" we follow Mitsuha and Taki on a romantic adventure straight out of your own imagination.When young Mitsuha and Taki start exchanging bodies, everything in their lifes would change. The viewer follows them on a exciting adventure of love, school life and growing into an adult.Taki is a young boy from Tokyo living his life while going to school and working a part-time job. He's a compelling main character, someone who's easy to follow as the degenerate that I am.Mitsuha on the other hand is a country girl. She lives out in the country, going to school and performing ceremonies with her family since they take care of the town shrine. She's an energetic girl, with dreams about moving to Tokyo and leaving her town. The viewer has an easy time relating to a girl in the same situation as her.ART & MUSICMy favourite part about this movie is not the characters or the story. It's the art and music. The art is excellent with wonderful colours and vibrant animations. There's not a single moment in this movie that isn't wallpaper friendly. Just screen cap any moment that you like and you got yourself a new wallpaper.The music is also incredible. It's all produced by the band ""Radwimps"" and you can find the tracks on Youtube but also Spotify. It's some of the best music I've ever heard in an anime.RATING & RECOMMENDATIONFor me this movie is a clear 10/10. I watched it at home at first but then later went to my local cinema in Sweden since they actually had a screening there. In total, since it's release in Sweden. I believe I've watched it 5-10 times. Everytime it gets better! Would highly recommend to anyone interested in anime, Japan or just a fun and heartwarming movie! Be ready for some feels though!Thank you for reading!"
" I don't cry with anything but this...
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,9,"Can you fall in love with someone you've never met?
For stories as exciting and full of feeling as this is that I really appreciate Japanese animation. It takes us to the story of two strangers with completely different lives who are destined to find themselves following the already known Legend of the Red Thread with the only drawback that without prior notice, both change their bodies, which forces them to live in each other's personal lives and they can not remember the other's name and their threads are intertwined with time. I was left with my mouth open with its animation so polished, with the warm landscapes and how real the characters feel. Without falling short, explore this concept passionately, as Miyazaki Movies has us so accustomed. I have cried, I have smiled and I have learned that true love waits. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie and try not to be filled with tears like I did."
" The picture is really beautiful.
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,7,"The picture is really beautiful. The scenery of the town is impressive. But the plot always feels strange, especially in the end, when they meet on the overpass at night and the bell rings, the last act is not. Does that mean it's a new story?"
" Jaw dropping animation, but may not turn anime-non-believers
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,7,"This is a really sweet film. This anime has one of the most vibrant color palettes I have ever seen on screen and its animation clearly was worked on with a lot of hard work. To top it, the plot is really sappy and kind of melodramatic, but I don't think this necessarily hurts the film. People who love slice-of-life/romantic animes will get a kick out of this film, but I can't promise others that they will appreciate it as much since the third act does drag on and the use of music is a bit excessive creating a feeling of disingenuous drama.For me, I did tear up a bit. The hand-painted cells are just amazing and I can be a sucker for sappy romance. And the plot does give something to the audience member to engage on. If I was a bigger fan of anime and was more tolerable of the ""Anime Music Video"" vibes I was getting from this film, I might have rated it higher. I implore everyone to give this film a try and hopefully you'll get more out of this film than I did."
" Restoring faith in cinema - even with its inevitable flaws.
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,9,"As many have said, this film makes you feel things that few others have in the last decade. It's a collage of mesmerizing animation, original story, heartwarming music and relatable characters, put together with a captivating plot.Despite some plot holes, inevitable with these type of stories, this film manages to stay focused and never lose track of its goal: give the audience a unique cinematic experience.After finished watching, I had forgotten how to breath properly. If a film does this, it has absolutely fulfilled its purpose and becomes more than just entertainment."
" WOW
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,10,"Thanks to fun-joyable characters, the amazing animation, wonderful story, great lecture on Japanese beliefs and a very unexpected mid-story twist, ""Your Name."" is probably my favorite anime of all time. I hope a sequel is in the works"
" A Masterpiece

Being a fan of Shinkai's work , I expected nothing less and believe me, this movie will not disappoint!!!I originally mistook it for another teen movie but the unique and amazing story evoloves into much more over the course of the film.The characters are well defined and likeable.The visuals are amazing, breathing life into the tiniest of details. I don't want to go much into the story. I assure you,this movie will entertain you with its special humor. Just go watch it !!!!"
" More than perfection
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,10,"It will be a crime if someone doesn't give it a 10/10.
Mind blowing, thought provoking and a movie that will make you want to have a story like this to share in your real life.
And about the sound tracks!!!! Hats off !!! RADWIMP did something more than beautiful. The lyrics were so perfect with the plot and so does the music!!!
I just need to find a girl who is exactly this much crazy about this masterpiece like me."
" I didn't expect this.
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,10,I wanted to watch because my friend suggested it but i ended up sobbing several times and asking 'i wonder what Taki is doing right now' after watching it
" MUST SEE MOVIE !!
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,10,"Make sure that you watch this movie before you die
If you have1hour and 45 minutes before you die go watch this so you can die in peace !!
You are missing a masterpiece of art!!!"
" Doesn't get better than this.

" What Shoud I write?
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,10,I can't describe this movie in words. To those who already watched the movie. You don't need my review and to those who haven't watch. I sugguest you better do. Never miss out a movie like this one. So beautiful story indeed. I am a huge fan now.
" Great
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,10,Great animated film with really good story line and romance. The animation is excellent!
" Best anime I've ever seen
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,10,"This is without a doubt my favorite anime of all time possibly my favorite movie in general. The story line has you on edge for the entire show. Plus this movie really gets you in the feels and when it ends you want to watch it over and over again until your finally satisfied. The detail is just incredible, some scenes are just wonderful to look at on a 32 inch tv. The amount of time spent on making this has to be the best use of time in the entire wide world. Now I'm a pretty stone cold guy but this show hits that very small romantic side and bursts it into crazy emotion. This is the longest revie I've ever wrote which should tell you something about how good it is. This show is worth the watch any time over any movie. I give you my word"
" Iyiydi
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,9,Islenisi cok iyiydi. Bence bu tarz anime filmlerin cok daha yayginlasmasi lazim
" A Joyful Shinkai Film
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,6,"It was in the middle of my first semester in college when I got the chance to watch this film. It was a nasty and gross winter day. I expected the usual melancholy love story which Shinkai had did in his prior works. However, after watching this film I felt joy and happiness resonating in me and in a way enlightened my day (I watched it in the middle of the day).This film's joy is routed in its soundtrack, story, and visuals. The film's soundtrack done by Radwimps, fits the tone and setting of the story so well. It has a nice mix of rock and classical music within soundtrack. The story is also very well done. I found the story even though basic at its roots to be very dynamic. The visuals, like usual, are stunning in this film. The backgrounds especially are truly breathtaking. Also, the character designs are a lot better than in his prior works. They are not great but they are better. Another interesting aspect of the film was its tone. The tone was really light heated compared to the rest of Shinaki's works that I have watched.Some issues I had with the film is that the characters could have been more developed. I did enjoy the characters, but characters like Taki are given little character development and feel some what run of the mill. Another huge problem is the film's plot holes. A minor, but not too noticeable issue, is the pacing. During points in the film the pacing felt a bit odd.In conclusion, this film might not be masterpiece, but I still think it is a great watch. It is definitely the best of Shinaki's films (so far) and is personally one of my favorites. I highly recommend watching this film."

I'm not that weak but I don't know why my eyes are fulfill with tears. This movie is something special. Every time I heard about this movie I got butterflies in my heart and feels like I need to cry hard. I don't hate this feeling. I with I can go there. I like every thing about this movie. Everything. I can't explain how much it is. It's been two or three years I watched it. But I still have the same feelings. Today! in the beginning of the new year I thought I should do something that I love. And I did. Watch it and you'll love better.

" A beautiful and unique film

" A touching masterpiece
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,10,"Being an admirer of Studio Ghibli's films, particularly the sometimes overlooked quieter films like ""Whisper of the Heart"" or ""Ocean Waves"", I had high expectations of ""Your Name"". Rather than being disappointed, I was blown away.It feels a lot different from Ghibli's works or even more recent animes but it didn't take long to be drawn into both style and story, as they go together perfectly. Yes, there's this touch of naivety and gullibility in ""Your Name"" as much as in many animes but I appreciate that. It's part of a creative and hopeful world of it's own powerful enough to make you take it for real for the duration of the film.From setting to character design and also pacing and writing - there's nothing that could be criticized if you let yourself in for the world Makoto Shinkai and his likewise talented team is creating. If the only animes you're appreciating are cynical and somewhat plausible films like ""Ghost in the Shell"" or ""Jin Roh"", this might not be for you. But for anyone else, ""Your Name"" is highly recommended."

" I thought I loved it but then I watched it again
",2018-12-21 00:00:00,8,"When I first watched the film, I was bawling my eyes out even 40 minutes after the movie had come to its end. To my surprise, second round of this movie didn't awake any emotion in me at all.I think a movie succeeds if it manages to evoke emotion even after watching it several times. With Kimi no na wa I was actually more invested in the visual side and the soundtrack of the movie during the second time. Those things really are worth mentioning, because the movie's visuals are absolutely stunning. Def worth watching in HD if you just get the chance.However, the plot is kinda vague and I even got frustrated waiting for the end result. The movie felt like it was trying to go on - as if they were forcefully dragging the film to its end.It's still a solid eight, because when I first saw this film, I thought it had hit the jackpot."
" Amazing, Amazing and Amazing

" A must-watch film for every romance-lover, fantasy-lover or mystery-lover
",2018-12-19 00:00:00,10,"I love romance movies, I love fantasy movies. So, obviously this movie is a delight for me. Never ever I had thought that a anime film would top the list of all the romantic films I have watched over the years. This movie smashed all the prejudices I had towards anime films.
Though this movie is a thought-provoking one like its other Japanese counterparts, it also provides countless moments for a typical audience like me which would hold the attention throughout. Spectacularly drawn visuals, specially the fictional natural landscape of itomori town. The chemistry between the lead characters is just owwww, which surpasses the barrier of time and space. Several scenes might not make sense, but still you will want to sit through the whole movie; and by the time this film ends, I can assure you, you will be filled with a heartwarming feeling of content (just the perfect amount to make you hang over it, maybe for the rest of your life).
Enjoy."

" magical realism
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,7,"A comet is approaching. Mitsuha Miyamizu is a 17 year old high school girl in the small town of Itomori. Her dad is the mayor and she's tired of her small town life. Her friends complain about her behavior the day before but she doesn't remember. She wishes to be reborn as a boy in the big city. Her wish comes true as she wakes up in the body of high school student and part time waiter Taki. It's like a dream as they inhabit each other's body.The animation is beautiful. The story is imaginative. The characters are lovely and compelling. There is magical realism to the movie. The plot does get a little jumpy which does fit the style. I would be more interested if it's cleared up a bit more. The movie climaxes at the impact and it drags out the ending a bit. Taki should have encountered Mitsuha at that point. Her father could be dead and she would be on top of the hill tending his grave. The searching in Tokyo is poetic for a little while but at some point, I just wanted it to end the movie and the ending is never in doubt."

",2018-11-12 00:00:00,7,"When I first watched this I was impressed. It is a really good movie, but everyone is treating it like the next 'Spirited Away' which I think is a little much. It's a unique story, with great animation and well written characters, not to mention an open ending. But it's not what everybody makes it out to be."
" Absolutely Stunning Film
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,10,"Emotional and visually stunning. I can't even begin to explain how much this film has left a mark on me.During the first quarter of the film, I was so sure I knew how it would end. This isn't exactly a completely new concept so I was sure the rest of the film would be sweet but so predictable. I'm so happy to say that I was completely wrong.Instead I was on the edge of my seat the entire film, it was so tense whilst also coming across as hilarious and heartwarming. I'm annoyed at how long it has taken me to sit down and watch it.Definitely give this a go, whether like me you have been watching anime for years or you never have. I assure you that you won't regret it."
" It was very beautiful, but also quite derivative
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,8,"Watching the trailer I thought this is going to be like Voices of a Distant Star or the myriad of similar anime since. Same nice scenery, piano music, long space and time communication , the touching of two people's souls (of course, high school boy and girl). And it was! Up until half of the movie. Then the original idea of the script kicked in and saved the story. I have to say that for people who have never watched Japanese anime this should be quite beautiful, but for long time fans it touches all the right buttons in a sort of mechanical and predictable way.It is a very beautiful romantic fantasy, but it sure felt very derivative. I know nothing is truly original, but as the movie ended (in a quite predictable manner), I wanted a little more - I don't know what. Perhaps more than the cardboard characters or the dusk lit countryside scenery with the piano music. The only interesting character for me was the senior waitress from where Taki worked. The rest were all the childish Japanese cliches that you see in all the anime."
" Greatest anime movie
",2018-11-08 00:00:00,10,This is the most amazing movie that has ever been made. Rare movies like 'your name' are the ones that leave me in this strong emotional Feel feeling and I love this movie with all my heart. I've watch it like 5 times now !

" ""Gift"" to the hopeless nation
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,9,"""The disease which humans are last affected is ""hope"".""
This quote originated from Saint-Exupéry, the French author of ""The Little Prince"", is one of the sales copies of this film.Blockbuster films always reflect an atmosphere of the era.Once in Japan, in exchange for the energetic economy having drastically arisen by the recovery from the WWII, people had lost the relationship with others. Recently, they also released their economic advantages to other countries which has been their last resort. Moreover, tossed about by social network services targeting each person's approval desire, human relationships acceleratingly have become vacant. Nowadays, a sense of stagnation is spreading throughout the country.Through this process, the chronic disease gradually infected people and several levels of their communities including nation, companies, men, women, young, elderly, and even children. The name of the disease is ""hopeless"".In this film, a boy and a girl face the impatience that is not easily accessible to each other, quite typical in orthodox romance stories. Unlike the other ones, this irritating situation is highlighted by contrasting the spatiotemporal distance between them, and also the distance between this world and the other world derived from a Buddhism concept. This distance as best blend of these scientific and religious descriptions is the straightforward metaphor of the desperate gap between hope and hopeless in our reality.Body switching, Sci-Fi, young romance, beautiful CGs, catchy songs, etc.... Crowd pullers are smartly packed into this film though, outstanding was its title. ""Your"" is the most equal word for everybody. Definitely this word sense gave sympathy to any generation, even to the elderly, thereby reminding of their own experiences: ""whenever and wherever in your life, fortune can be (or could have been) encountered."" This universal message could touch one's too dry mind like an oasis in a desert.About sixty years ago just after the WWII, exactly the same titled film was also the blockbuster in Japan, when people had surely the hope to reconstruction supported by firm human relationships nevertheless in poverty. On reflection, since today's people are living in the era of a digital visualization of everything, they may retrospectively desire such an analog type of ""hope""."
" YOUR NAME THE BEST LOVE STORY YET
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,10,I am speechless after watch the love story of mitsuha and taki.the feeling after watching this movie i can't explain because i can't explain it in my words
" one of my favourite anime movies
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,7,"Although a lot of japanese movies and animes have the same plot (going back in time to save someones live ) but still this movie was different in someway ,i would say the movie animation played a huge part in giving it such a high rate, but still there is this one thing that didn't made sense to me which is:( why they insist on remembering the name he could give her his address or something and they always try to remember just the first name which is not going to be that helpful when you are searching for some one) ,but overall it was a great movie and i would be happy to watch it again."
" Just woow

" One of the Best from the Heart of Tokyo
",2018-10-25 00:00:00,9,"This is one of the best animes to come out of Japan.It is such a beautiful anime with scenes that are actually based on real-life Tokyo. Not only that, but it has a really interesting storyline that is quite spiritual and makes you think about the difference between a body and soul (or a person's personality that is beyond the physical). It is all tied-in with the lives of two people who live far from one another, but have a destiny to meet.I love it when the media of anime is combined with mature themes that can be enjoyed by the whole family.Definitely recommended for anime fans. I think I will buy this for my movie collection as it can be enjoyed on so many levels."

" stunning visual effects but that's all
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,5,"This movie has drop dead gorgeous/ stunning visual effects, however the plot is confusing and the ""teenageyness"" was just too annoying. The scenes where the characters become aware of their different gender parts is really strange, not amusing, just weird. There's not enough plot. I felt completely drowned by the visuals and the music. (I actually paused the movie in order to search for an option to silence the music and only hear the dialogue, to no avail. Perhaps I would have liked the movie more if I could have accomplished this.) I was desperate for meaningful dialogue and deeper character development. If you are interested in anime you'd be better served to watch the following: Ponyo, A Letter to Momo, When Marnie Was Here, The Secret World of Arrietty, Vampire Hunter, Howls Moving Castle, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, Castle in the Sky, Princess Mononoke, and My Neighbor Totoro; to name a few."

" A true life changer movie , a true masterpiece that you ill not forget
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,10,"I remember once i was studying story boarding and scenario , one of my teacher who was really wise in everything let's say ... he tell us that if you wanna get a masterpiece project you should give it a special identity that identify your culture in term culture life and mythological story and finally a creative love story cause love is what our life stand on ... during watching this movie i was impressed of the contrast they make between the characters , the places , the culture the religion the mythological past and the story line , that in term of story and creativity 
when i pass to rate the 2D drawing , the animation and the art , everything was perfect and more , the environment was unique the details was unbelievable and as an animator i can say that the animation was more than amazing each frame and each pose and even the acting was wooooow <3<3 , finally the character was magnificent even voice actor and the music are awesome that touch your soul and move your heart .... 
the studio was really focusing in all the details they really make a movie thay i cannot forget or get bored from it even after watching it more than 5 times <3 <3 and that what i did truly"

Kimi no na wa was the best thing I have seen in years and absolutely deserves your time and attention. I won't tell details, for I went in completely oblivious and that made it ever more beautiful. Do yourself a favor: look up the English sub, get comfortable, relax, and watch the movie. Afterwards, make an account for IMDB because you need to let everyone know how much fun you had watching it. That's what I did. ;)"
" A Timeless Romance
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,9,"Your Name is yet another example of an animated film being able to transcend the typical boundaries of the genre. Just as Pixar has done several times over, Your Name constructs a gorgeous looking 90 minutes of animation, all while making a movie that can be enjoyed by children and adults. The best part is that this film goes way more layers deep than any romantic animation film I have seen, at least in quite some time. It deal with themes of death, freewill, and how time is not exactly something you can explain so easily. At its best, Your Name is a romantic thriller with deep visuals and ideas, with just the perfect amount of everything to please several parties.9.6/10"
" Great Heart 💓 touching movie
",2018-09-27 00:00:00,10,"Its a great heart touching movie.
I have no other words to say thank you"
" Much deeper than just a fantasy
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,10,"Fascinating story. At first, it gives you an impression that this is yet another story on switch of bodies while time traveling (like ""17 again"" or ""13 going on 30""), but it is so much more! ""Your name"" is objectively one of the greatest educative (!) stories about love.
By using the Musubi legend and the worldwide favorite ""red rope"" theory, the movie teaches that the right person is settled in your mind much earlier before you actually meet, probably from your birth, and you'll feel the lack of his/her presence on daily basis until the day you finally meet. The story teaches us that no matter what, the unvisible red rope (well, the visible one in this anime) will unite you one day and you will understand that this is the ONE by one simple glance.
The most significant lesson that beautiful story teaches us is to hear your heart and trust those magical visions, which are sent to you from the Universe through dreams in the past or stories you've heard once and which are stuck in your head for no reason.
But the reason always exists! Wait for that special person."
" An amazing movie
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,10,I FINALLY saw this film and I am so happy because this is one of the most unique and beautiful film. I wish that American films could come up with such unique ideas because Hollywood is just not making those great films anymore. I have to say that this was one of the best animated film of 2016.
" Fantastic

" Visually amazing Japanese anime production that will provide you joyful viewing.
",2018-09-15 00:00:00,9,"I thoroughly enjoyed this Japanese anime production, the plot was very well written and the visual effects made you feel a sense of euphoria and awe. I don't want to delve into the story line to much as I would highly encourage you if you are reading this film too take the time to watch it, I would especially suggest it if you want something to watch with your partner if you have one as the main theme's of the film are romance and love."
" Love

" The best love story, and movie, I have EVER witnessed. Literally
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,10,I'm truly speechless. I don't know what to say other than what I wrote as a title.Truly the best love story of all time. Emotional. Moving. I can't describe it in words.My biggest regret now is that I rated some other (great) movies a perfect 10 before this one. Because this one is so so so so much more. It really deserves a rating of it's own.My first and probably final review after hundreds of ratings without making one.Enjoy this masterpiece.
" I was astonised in a good way :)
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,10,"I am no fan of most anime (I don't really understand it is a culture) but Your Name made me change my mind. It has a beautiful and deep story, an original idea, life-like characters. I am a little bad with words because Your Name self me speechless. A must watch for everyone!"
" Just... Wow.
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,10,"Okay - one thing we need to make clear. Exchanging bodies. Not a ""never been done"" feature, and usually executed as running gags of ""oh I got boobs"" and ""oh I got a pee pee"". If you're hesitant to watch this movie because of this story aspect I can assure you - it gets noted with some expected gags, but in this movie the characters actually get over it!Kimi No Na Wa is a wonderful anime in both story line and art. It's so rare to find an anime with these two so perfectly combined that it alone made me want to cry from happiness.This movie is one heck of a ride. It instantly grabs your interest and the story has some very, VERY well done twists. I honestly can't find any fault with this one - stunning visuals, well written characters, exquisite storyline... Everything hits home. Even if you happen to be one of those people who don't much care for romances, this movie presents a challenging mystery and the plot is so satisfying!I'm so happy this anime exists."
" Best piece of art my eyes have ever witnessed
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,10,"This movie has in its depth, its details, its messages outcasted any movie I have ever watched. It's a majestic masterpiece in any aspect. Everything that happens, that's said, every motion and scene has its profound meaning and sense. It leaves your mind in questions during the movie but each one gets answered, nothing is left untouched, each apsect is worked on beautifully. My boyfriend has always hated anime series and this movie is as he says the best one he has ever seen. Yoi are going to think about it long after the last scene has left you in happy tears. Music is beautiful, landscapes gorgeus, characters deeply elaborated and detailed. Complex and beautiful."
" Absolutely brilliant
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,10,"Extremely marvelous,sci-fi,romantic animation for me so far & and the ending was too good,i am spellbound"
" A magnificent and emotional work of art
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,10,"THREE REASONS THIS IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL FILM: 1. QUALITY OF ANIMATION/CINEMATOGRAPHY
2. EMOTIONAL IMPACT AND PLOT TWISTS
3. ATTENTION TO DETAIL1. QUALITY OF ANIMATION/CINEMATOGRAPHY - I cannot remember the last time I gasped at how beautiful the background art was in a film. Some scenes are downright amazing to look at and left me with the feeling of awe.2. EMOTIONAL IMPACT AND PLOT TWISTS - Starts off at a funny romantic comedy then unexpected plot twists move the film and audience into such deep emotions at the same level as ""The pursuit of Happiness"" or ""Lion"" Themes of deep, painful longing, abandonment, hope and love. I was moved to tears. 3. ATTENTION TO DETAIL - I am astounded at how every little detail all ties together in the end. The plot was so complex and yet, when I watched it a second time, I saw so many clues and signs that hinted at the dramatic changes. Incredible attention to detail. If there's any fault to the movie, it is a lack of story with Taki's character who probably deserved a little more screen time on his history. I thought the ending also took too long to resolve. I don't want to spoil it so I'll just leave it at that. Such amazing and moving story telling. One of my favorite films of all time."
" Overrated AF
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,4,"When I first saw Your Name, I enjoyed it for the most part. I thought the pop music montages and dialogue were pretty cringey, but overall the film was visually and atmospherically impressive enough for me to fall for it.After a recent rewatch, I was actually shocked at how emotionally manipulative and utterly devoid of substance this movie really is. I'll break everything down for this:The body swapping is a fairly generic idea, but they could have done a lot with it. Unfortunately it fails on so many levels to further cement the idea of the two protagonists exploring each other's lives and personalities, and instead the movie tricks the viewer into thinking that this actually happens. The two leads never learn about each other's lives from swapping bodies on any emotional level, instead those cringey montages that I mentioned before gloss over this important aspect that should have been more properly handled. This is also extremely problematic since we're supposed to believe that Taki and Mitsuha actually fall in love with each other, but we never find out why. They don't learn anything from living as the opposite gender either, in fact the story relies on breakage of character for comical effect. For example, the normally androgynously behaved and chilled-out Taki acts like a sporty, aggressive, manly-man while in Mitsuha's body.SPOILERS: The second half of the movie is just as disastrous as the disaster it depicted. Not only does it abruptly drop the comedic tone of the first half of the movie, but it handles disaster and loss rather badly too. It relies far too heavily on the protagonists making dumb decisions, wasting time complaining about nothing, retardedly running around for no reason, and idiotically forgetting each other's names. All this is made even more unbearable by yet another wave of godawful pop music montages and cringey dialogue. In the end there's no emotional loss in Your Name. There's no sacrifice, no learning from your mistakes, because in the end the protagonists just reverse the timeline and save the day. But now they've forgotten about each other forever? Surely there's a bittersweet ending? Nope, they get reunited and live happily ever after in the end, that's what happens. That time wasting ordeal of running around and forgetting each other's names meant nothing in the end.Even though there are also many MANY plot holes that I didn't mention, Your Name's number one issue boils down to the atrocious writing and badly thought out story and characters. I still adore the film's visuals and immersive atmosphere, but it simply falls flat as a story."
" Mainstream anime movie
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,5,"It's indeed a visually stunning movie that has a wonderful depiction of japanese landscapes and architectures, it's well directed as well and uses symbolism well. These are the strongest points that keep the movie from being mediocre.My main issue with this movie comes from the fact that its fantasy aspect doesn't make any sense and falls apart as soon as you start thinking about it. I'm supposed to think that Taki, despite that he spent quite some time in the body of Mitsuha, having been to her school, having used her phone, never attempted to know or even noticed by mistake that he was in the past ?
Same goes for the name of the town, which he should have noticed at least accidentally, and should have remembered since a town being vaporized by a meteor is a national catastrophe. He could of course forget once he wakes up, like for her name, but this would mean that this rule only serves to artificially create conflict.Makoto Shinkai wrote other similar scripts and doesn't seem very interested in more fleshed out love stories, it's often heavily based around a single feeling of lovelorn melancholy. This movie has indeed a taste to it but it's pretty naive and he's clearly not interested in creating a complexe story, even though he came up with a good premise. The problems with the script wouldn't be an issue with me at all if it was more than just convenient for the narrative, but it didn't create a lot of moments that gave depth or perspectives to the characters.I'm giving a lot of crap to this movie here but apart from what I'm criticizing, the rest fits well altogether, it's a good movie but it doesn't take much risks, and I don't see how some can compare it to Eternal Sunshine or Satoshi Kon's movies..."
" Excellent anime - a cross between Eternal Sunshine and Source Code
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,9,"A lovely, beautifully-animated Japanese anime film. It's alternately funny, exciting, and deeply tender and touching. It has a wonderful mix of sci-fi elements while still being completely grounded in realism. I found myself reminded of the emotional highs, seemingly doomed romances, and clever sci-fi of a couple of my favorite films: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Source Code. A wonderful film that I am looking forward to watching again."
" A totally disappointing Makoto's movie
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,1,"A really disappointing animation by Shinkai Makoto. I used to love his work like ""5 Centimeters Per Second"" but this time he created a mass of kitsch. Yes the animation is beautiful but it can't tell the story. ""Your Name."" is just a bad taste anime to entertain the audience, and show how Makoto lost his own vision and style to made a popular popcorn movie (like Michael Bay did). The thing I can't stand the most is how the people keep hyping this movie (even Makoto told people do not go to the theater watch this movie). The main characters are empty. They didn't have a real interaction, I cannot understand why the people think this is emotional. Okay maybe the emotion doesn't really need to be rational but I hardly feel the characters' mind. At the end, the story cannot express any feeling (the music is not suitable for the mood too).In conclude, the whole anime is disappointing. The reason is not about how bad it is, it's about how Makoto fail to be an artist, and a stylist he could be."
" Hilarious and heartfelt.
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,10,"Makoto Shinkai's YOUR NAME achieved what would arguably be a most improbable feat: it dethroned Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away to become Japan's most successful film. And what a movie it is! Heartfelt, hilarious, moving, thrilling, and enthralling, this movie cleverly mixes together the central idea from Disney's FREAKY FRIDAY with a bit of BACK TO THE FUTURE for good measure.It's about two teens -- Taki and Mitsuha -- who somehow find themselves switching places in their bodies periodically. (A running gag involves Taki waking up in Mitsuha's place noticing ""his"" breasts.) Stakes get higher in the latter half when the two star-crossed strangers use that connection to avert a tragedy. Sounds like a bizarre story for an animated film, doesn't it? But it works. The first half in particular, where we see the difficulties that Taki and Mitsuha experience during their supernatural ""body swapping"" episodes, is hysterically funny. It's only in the second half when things get a little slower, but even then, Shinkai manages to maintain a lot of interest for the viewers, notably in the form of a stylized ""time travel"" sequence and of course the chemistry between the leads.The dubbing is very well done as well, as per usual by NYAV Post. Both Mike Sinterniklaas and Stephanie Sheh voice the lead characters (and apparently directed each other as well), and turn in great performances. The show stealer, though, is young Catie Harvey as Mitsuha's little sister Yotsuha, who arguably gets the best lines in the film: ""I see you're not touching your boobies today!"" she snarks at her sister.YOUR NAME is more of a story for teenagers and adults, but kids might enjoy watching it, too, for aside from the occasional sexual innuendo (which is mostly played for laughs and frankly, is tame compared to what you would see in raunchier Anime), there's little else to offend."

This movie is the most spectacular work of art I've ever seen, and probably will ever see in my entire life. Never have I ever seen or read anything that made me feel the characters' pain, and joy, and frustration like this. This movie (and saying that this is simply a ""movie"" feels like I'm comparing the Mona Lisa to a toddler's fingerpainting) made me feel so much raw emotion that I was literally shaking (and occasionally crying) throughout every amazing second of it. The ending definitely leaves you wanting more, begging for even just an extra five minutes of the wonderful story. I wish that there could be more movies like this."
" Absolutely brilliant!
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,10,"Coming from a guy who normally watches series like bleach and naruto I decided to change up the genre a bit (because why the hell not ) So asked around to see what shows and films are so called 'awesome' and 'lit' and I heard the film "" your name "" appear quite frequently so I decided to watch it. Now I can honestly say this film definitely lives up to its hype. The character development outstandingly good, the premise was on a whole new level of excellence. Additionally the penultimate of the film kept me on edge, praying that the next outcome would be the one that I hoping for; it was exactly that! Absolutely brilliant!!!! 10/10"
" Overrated
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,3,"Your Name is one of those movies/shows where I just don't understand the ridiculous praise it gets. Yes, the concept of body swapping is interesting and well executed in the first half. But then it starts to become full of extremely vague or completely unexplained plot points that break immersion and leaves the viewer unsatisfied. It's a complete mess. The ending is also dumb and negates the entire point of the movie."
" Lifechanging!
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,10,"Well,i can not use any Emotional Word to Describe This Anime and I do not Want My Review to be The Best. But Honestly This Anime Changed My Entire Life, Yeah Maybe Some Of you are Saying That : Yeah this Anime is Great, But it is not that good to Change Someones Life. But Let Me Tell You The Story of my Life Then You Can Judge me.I Was born 15 years Ago in Iran. I had a Difficult Childhood,I Mean Emotionally. In That Rough Time I Learned Nobody Cares For me, Even my parents. And Since My Parents were Religious, So I Learned That There is no One for me in this World, So I Have to Be with God To Find The Real Peace.I Was Growing with This Attitude That God is The Final Peace. But Last Summer Things Became Tough For me, And Frankly I Could not Find The Inner Peace, so One Day, Out of nowhere, I Thought Suicide Is The Best Way To Find That Final Peace. Well Thinking Of Suicide Was Kind Of Sweet. But One Day I was In Imdb website that i Saw a News About Your Name. Everybody suggested This Anime, And said This is great and you have to watch it.Well First I Thought it's like Other Animes that Finally Two People Love Each Other and That's it. But Frankly I Believed That There is a Soul Mate For Everyone but Mostly They Do not Find Each other.Anyway, I Thought maybe it,s good for my soul and it can Heal My Heart. Then I Downloaded it and started to watch it. When i Finished watching it, i was totally a Different human. there was a Hope in My Heart That Says: You will Find Your Soul Mate, Be sure. and The Strange Part is I Found Her, I Found My Soul Mate. Yeah That,s True, one Day I Was Thinking About Suicide Now I'm Thinking How Can i Marry her and Live For Her. And Also Exactly Like This Anime, When Something Happens For Her, I Quickly understand That. Yeah That,s The Power Of Real Love.I know i talked A lot and maybe My Review has mistakes, But It Was My Duty To Write This Review, And At The End, if Someone didn't find His or Her Soul mate, No Problem you Will Find It."

" Kimi no na wa, a story that uses every bit of its potential.
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,10,"The first time I watched the film I didn't know what I was expecting, and I'm so glad that I had no expectations. From the story to the animation/cinematography, Your Name did not disappoint me for a single second of the story that unfolded in front of me. It felt that every word and character mattered in this movie, there were no puzzle pieces that didn't fit. As I was watching, I felt a connection to each character, feeling what they were feeling. Not many movies can accomplish sympathy for each character. But Makoto Shinkai (Director) was able to captivate me as a viewer and as a person. There is no reason not to watch this film, and if you haven't I strongly advise you do. It might just change your perspective."
" A movie for the heart
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,9,"There is a oftenly uttered (I cannot name it as a cliché) sad notion: If you lose someone when you are little or if a very long time passed since that moment, you cannot remember who that person was. That is how i fell about my grandmothers. I can't remember how they sounded like, what did they like, why they were angry. I can only remember vague things like how would one prepare a meal or how would other frown over my misbehaviour. These thoughts makes me feel sad and a little bit lost.
I followed this train of thought when i watched this movie. Japanese movies and animes usually follow these kinds of uncanny but strong sentiments and when done right(not too streched thin like in long-running animes), it is bullseye. Those men now how to manipulate my feelings. I have felt seperation and forgetting something i longed for.
It had some dorky and pervy humor of animes, some metphysical aspects to complete the recipe and at the end we had an emotionally moving piece to enjoy."

" MY FAVORITE MOVIE !
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,10,"Makoto shinkai did an amazing job animating this movie , the hand drawn animation is simply put breath taking .
In addition to that , the story is very well rounded , the characters are all well depicted , enough not to leave the viewers imagination roaming . 
Thanks love story that occurs between the two main characters with some elements of body swap is not an original idea , but adding in some other elements ( no spoilers) makes it a hall different story .
In summary your name , with it's beautiful animation , relatable characters , and heartwarming love story became my favorite movie"
" brilliant concept
",2018-07-18 00:00:00,8,I do loved this movie...but they should have shown a bit more of the end..like wht the two of them were like after getting to know each other..
" Best chinese documentary I've ever seen
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,10,"Truly breathtaking visuals and story, similar to that of Border Patrol UK or Crimewatch. It's a must see."
" What an awesome piece of art.. Every one should watch
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,10,"I usually don't rate movies they are so common. But this movie is awesome. One of the best movies I have ever watched..It is perfect combination of romance, emotion, science, spiritual ... every thing. I never thought love could break the space time continuum..
also I found the dubbed version in hindi language by animetmdubbers, they really made it. Thanks producers and dubbers, you made my day"
" Smh
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,3,"See the thing I hate most about people who review movies is that all the good movies that have a plot and an actual story get the bad ratings and reviews, and then there's this movie. Let me start off by saying I'm currently watching this movie while writing this because I have already lost complete interest in this. Why did I lose interest in this?? Because the plot and screenplay is complete garbage, everything about the timeline of this movie is horrible put together and makes no sense unless you google it. What I don't understand is how
This movie has great ratings because honestly this movie is just plain bad. I've never written a review before and I was hoping this movie would resolve itself but it still hasn't and i doubt it will. I decided to give this movie a chance because I grew up watching and loving every single one of Hayao miyazakis movies and I thought why not I'll give this a shot. But here I am regretting this movie. The only thing I like about this movie is the animation which is beautiful. It looks like they spent 95% of their efforts on the animation and just gave up with the plot, but to each their own I guess. I was hoping this would've been better."
" Outstanding
",2018-07-07 00:00:00,8,Not often I feel the sensation of the unknown. That's what i like to call it at least. Whenever i think or see something supernatural to the extent it scares me. I felt this feeling through a lot of this film. Beautiful. Magical. Mesmerising. The greatest animation of all time.
" i really wich i could give more than 10 stars
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,9,"A very lovely story with beutiful images, delightful chracters and an excellent rolercoaster of emotions."
" A modern romantic fairy tail
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,9,"This Anime is what you expect from a Japanese Anime. An amazing story telling and a magical film.When you see the title of the movie at first you won't guess anything about how the story will be. A surprise in every turn of events cannot guess what is coming next.
The characters are very well presented.You are discovering the events of the story in the same time the characters are. you keep on thinking what is going to happen as characters are discovering what is going on though the story.What is also great about the movie is the Japanese songs so beautiful adds a lot to the story, the cinematography is nothing less than amazing and enchanting.Finally, it is a must watch."
" one of the best animated movies ever!
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,10,This movie will intrigue you from start to finish. i can not say it any simpler that that.cause i may get started on a rant of how good it is
" Such a pretty anime <3
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,8,"I have to say this anime was absouletely breathtaking like the fact its set in an actual Japan town, makes this anime a whole lot nicer! I thought both Mitsuha and Taki were such interesting characters like it was bizzare that the pair of them were swapping bodies. Yet we still don't know why they were chosen and I mean thanks to Taki, he saved Mitsuhas life for being in her body and alerting everyone that the town is having a meteor attack. Although I felt sorry for him for not getting through to her self absorbed mayor of a father and then him turning off the alarms. Seriously he's a pure jack*ss in this anime lol!However the music, the relationship between Taki & Mitsuha and the specular views of the village made this anime worth watching for! I give it a 8/10!"
" Mesmerizing, has set a new bench mark for anime movies!
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,10,"I am an avid anime watcher and nothing compares to the quality of animation in this movie, it does it's best in expressing the beauty, culture and scenery of Japan, along with the enchanting music(Japanese version) the movie takes you to a whole different world, kudos to the team. The story is captivating and will keep you absorbed the entire time, the unexpected twists take you through a roller coaster of emotions, the English dub doesn't do justice to the original one, the meaning of phrases are much more deeper in Japanese, especially the final scenes, but that's the case with most of the Eng to Jap dub in my opinion. I am writing this after watching it the second time, Truly something you shouldn't miss out on."
" 9/10
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,9,Great japanese animation ever with a nice soundtrack. love it
" A Great Love Story
",2018-06-22 00:00:00,9,It's a great and touching story of Taki and Mitsuha. It is a great concept and an enjoyable movie. It's also got it's mystical elements. Though the end may leave some wondering. The animation is great and I would recommend this to a lot of people. I haven't got too much to note here since it was pretty straightforward and I'm going for no spoilers.
" Incredible. Out of words...
",2018-06-21 00:00:00,10,"Before I begin, I made an IMDB account just to review this specific movie. Have you ever browsed a movie site trying to find the perfect movie for you with good graphics, cinematography/animation, sound and a plot that makes you think for days? This movie is it. This movie is filled with amazing animation that Makoto Shinkai put tons of effort on. It's truly an eye opener towards animation movies. The story plot in the beginning could sound confusing and eventually bore you out, but as the story unravels, it's out of the ordinary and interesting. Since the language is in Japanese and I watched it with an English subtitle, I watched it over 4 times to make sure I didn't miss any parts. All 4 times of me watching gave me goosebumps and amazed me. This is the first Japanese animation movie that I watched and was worth every single second of the movie. If you are considering, WATCH IT!"
" Your Name: An Animated Masterpiece
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,10,"Makoto Shinkai's Your Name is my third favourite animated movie of all time, only being surpassed by Kaufman's Anomalisa and Miyazaki's Spirited Away. It is a masterfully crafted film that tells a simple story that manages to be fresh, intriguing, and beautiful throughout the entirety of its hour and fifty-two minute runtime. Shinkai somehow takes an idea that has been done a million times and gives it a fresh, new take that hasn't been done before. Some people will call his films melodramatic or petty, but what some people see as pretentious, I see as a stroke of pure genius. I am not only going to discuss why I believe that Your Name is masterclass filmmaking, but why Makoto Shinkai is a legend in the works. Firstly, I am going to go over my history with the film, and my initial reaction to seeing it. The first time I heard of Your Name was back in late 2016. I watched a movie review on the flick from one of my personal favourite film critics, Chris Stuckmann. I've always respected him and trusted his opinion, as we share the same fondness for movies and have a similar taste in film. I was quite surprised when he gave Your Name his highest score, an A+, and recommended it highly. I was very intrigued by his synopsis of the film and immediately sought it out. To my dismay however, I could not find the screening for the movie anywhere. Since I couldn't go see it in a theatre, I decided to wait for the DVD release of the movie, which was in April. I put it on my IMDB watchlist and patiently waited until I got my hands on the film and got to finally watch it. I didn't know much about the film going into it, although I was excited to see it, I deliberately kept myself as far from marketing and discussions on the film as I prefer to go into a movie as blind as possible. When I did get to see it, not only did Your Name meet my expectations and live up to the praise, but it did something more. Something else I didn't expect it to do. It wasn't only a good film, it was a phenomenal one. My hopes for the movie were quite high, and it still managed to be even better than I originally thought.Your Name starts with a fantastic scene that hooks the audience immediately after the movie starts. It's a scene that on first watch doesn't really make any sense, but upon revisiting, the movie, it is foreshadowing for the twist and end of the movie; the end is in the beginning. The next scene follows a girl going through her daily life, but everything seems off. Even though you've never seen this character, you still understand that there is something strange happening from hints from other characters and the girl's reaction to them. Shinkai puts the viewer inside of the shoes of this girl, in which we are in the same confused state as this girl. This makes the first scene feel like a dream which I am pretty sure is what he intended. The same scene is repeated, but instead it is a boy. We eventually learn that the boy (Taki) and the girl (Mitsuha) are actually swapping bodies, and they try to live their lives as the other person would want them to but there are conflicts. This makes for some really inventive and unique humour that gives the film levity. Later in the flick, the plot twist is revealed and it really works since it is not only creative and unexpected, but as handled really well. You feel the impact of those events on the characters, as well as the audience itself. On paper, this film has been done before, but execution-wise, this movie really nails it. Your Name is an idea that we have seen time and time again, but thanks to Shinkai, it has been done fantastically. Everything about this movie is great, from the animation to the cinematography. I'm going to go over why these things and are as great as they are. Firstly, the animation. This one is pretty self-explanatory once you see the movie. Every single shot is drawn gorgeously, especially the scenery. Shinkai is proven time and time again that he knows how to make some great looking backgrounds, and this film is no exception. This movie uses both hand-drawn and CG animation, and they are both used expertly. There isn't a single frame where I thought they were being lazy or not trying, the animation is on par with something like Studio Ghibli. Everything from the character designs to the scenery, looks phenomenal. Secondly, the story. I've already gone through it, so I won't say much other than it could have been a terrible movie, but thanks to Shinkai, it doesn't suck total balls. Next, the cinematography. The cinematography was pretty good in this movie. Even if it didn't blow me away, it was still really good looking. There were a lot of interesting shots in the film that weren't just for show, but actually had some meaning behind them. I really enjoy when directors add those few extra layers for film fans to dissect. That brings me to my next topic--the hidden meanings in the movie. As a big movie fan I love having more to chew on after the movie is over, and having to rewatch it to get everything. Some of my favourite movies are The Holy Mountain and Synecdoche New York, films that have tons of symbolism and need multiple watches to get everything. However, you can still enjoy these movies even if you don't understand everything, which is why I love them so much. Your Name may not be as deep as these movies and have as many layers as those movies, but it still has enough that analysing the movie is still a fun task. Finally, the score and soundtrack are absolutely breathtaking in this movie. This is one of my favourite japanese musical compositions in a movie since Hausu. I adore the music used in this movie and listen to it constantly. The music was done by a group called Radwimps, and although I haven't listened to their other music, I definitely want to check them out at some point. Those are the best parts of the movie. I didn't cover everything like the voice acting or characters, but that's because, though they were also good, they weren't as great as the other aspects of the movie. Nevertheless, there is still one more thing I would like to cover, that being the man behind the camera, Makoto Shinkai.Makoto Shinkai is an absolute madman. He went from making short films by himself to directing feature-length movies in the span of just two years. For comparison's sake, Hayao Miyazaki worked in the business for almost 20 years before his first feature. Shinkai isn't just really lucky, but also very talented and creative. All of his work that I have seen of his been pretty outstanding, even though I haven't seen all of his work. I really enjoyed Voices of a Distant Star, but I especially really liked both 5 Centimeters per Second and The Garden of Words. I still have yet to check out The Place Promised in Our Early Days and Children Who Chase Lost Voices, but they are really high up on my IMDB watchlist and I am really looking forward to watching them. People say that Shinkai could be the next Miyazaki, and to that I say, ""Yeah, maybe."" Even though he's not currently working on a new project, I seriously can't wait to see what Shinkai cooks up next.In conclusion, Your Name is a masterpiece in terms of film making and if anyone other than the man himself crowned the director's chair, it probably wouldn't be nearly as good as it was. In short, Makoto Shinkai is a goddamn legend."
" Cliff Hangar!! But...
",2018-06-16 00:00:00,10,"The ending can be a disappointment to those who watched it already but overall, the story and plot is good. I even cried watching this which means I totally can relate and I understood it too. Deserves a higher rating!!"
" A story like nothing i've ever seen
",2018-06-13 00:00:00,9,"This movies contains a real simplicity in complexity , it takes you through an extraordinary love story , during the first period of the movie you will be feeling like its an ordinary story and even guessing the end of it but in the middle of the movie things takes an unexpected sadly beautiful turn that would leave you in a shock but it will also give you the best time of your life."
" A beautiful romance, a mess of a science fiction
",2018-06-04 00:00:00,6,"I, like a good number of others, went into this expecting, not only from the look and feel, but also from the story portrayed in trailers, a similarity to certain other romantic works in terms of style (5 Centimeters per Second, Clannad). And on this account I was not disappointed. The artwork, animations, backgrounds, and lighting effects hold up to all of those other works. For the beauty alone it is worth the watch.The romance aspect did not quite hit the highs of these other works. I felt the characters didn't have enough time to develop their relationship. To the point of asking myself why they even liked each other in the first place. This was due to another failing in the film;The science fiction plot felt weak and under developed as well. Which is a shame because I feel like this is a good way to please a wider variety of audience. *SPOILER* The body swapping and the time travel aspect were fine, if not a little confusing, and added for some good comedic moments as well as a genuine shock of realization. The comet story line felt unnecessary, weak, and worst of all took away from the true meat of the romance. I feel like the story would have been better without it. *SPOILER*Overall this is a highly enjoyable movie, for a wide variety of audiences, but it lacks certain plot developments and focus to have it stand with some of the true greats. It is beautiful and I recommend a watch if for nothing else, but the effort and work dedicated to the visuals."
" Beautiful

" Not that impressive to me like other viewers rated.
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,6,"I have less appetite for animated movies. I watch only those which gets rating of 8 and above. After watching this movie, I simply felt it's exaggerated by viewers. It's not that heartfelt romantic neither emotional. ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" (2002) touched my heart more."
" The most epic anime I have ever seen.
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,10,"This is my first Makoto Shinkai anime ever to watch. Emotional, compelling, beautiful and epic. This is perfection at its finest. It's gripped me in this world that I wish could go on forever. This is a must see for everyone. This is something you don't wanna miss and if you do, trust me, you'll miss out on one of the best stories ever made. I have to go see his others just to see how he arrived to this amazing type of story telling."

" Great Movie :)

" One of my favorite animes ever.
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,9,"This thing is romantic, funny, mysterious, tragic, compelling, effortless, and purely wonderful, all of which could've easily fallen apart if the ending wasn't so absolutely perfect. I think, because of the confident way the story is told, a second viewing would really make it soar."
" An Extraordinary Heartwarming story of all time
",2018-05-04 00:00:00,10,"This movie is mesmerizing and meticulously made.
All of the graphics, scenery, effects, plot, and characters are all perfectly made. The title ""Your Name?"", is genius, which also is intriguing. The plot is perfect. At first we are brought to a story where the two characters live their life on a bizarre way. It shows us how they're living, who are separated very far away. Each of minute will made us intrigued of how these two main characters will live. The plot will make us as if we know them well and understand each of the character's feelings and problems. At first maybe we already would have guessed how this movie will go. But when 'that suspense' show up; which you will not know when you're going to feel that; you will be mind-blowned as well as burst into many feelings. Happy feelings, heartbreaking feelings, heart-warming feelings, all packed into one. The interactions between the two main characters are really unique and funny, yet lovable. There's also a lot of comedic scenes and dialogues in the movies, as well as the breathtaking scenes. 
The graphics, the scenery, are breathtaking. You still can imagine how the scenery will look in real life. Even you may wonder how beautiful living in the town where one of the main character lives.It's such an experience to watch an animated movie of this kind. There's no experience of the perfect combination between graphics, effects, characters, story that filled with many of emotions, in Non-animated movie. This anime movie nailed it beautifully.This is a recommended movie to everybody. I would absolutely re-watch this movie to feel those emotions again. So beautiful."
" Might be the greatest film I've ever seen
",2018-05-03 00:00:00,10,"(this is my review originally from myanimelist.com)Having never really seen any Anime before watching this movie (except from Pokemon and Dinosaur King when I younger), I didn't really have any expectations going into this. My family have a subscription to Amazon prime, and 'Your Name' was on there for free. Expecting at least a decent watch, what i saw instead was a Masterpiece in cinema, that I'll no doubt continue to love more and more as the years go on as I re-watch it.Story:The story starts out as a typical 'Slice of Life' kind of thing, except the main 2 characters from separate areas of Japan start swapping bodies with each other. Anyone who sees a DVD or Blu-ray of this movie knows this. But, something unexpected happens which tips the story on it's head and drives up the suspense and mystery. Don't read up anything about the plot. It leaves a lot of questioning and wonder which makes for an engrossing plot leaves you wanting more.Art:The art style is among the most beautiful I've ever seen. As an artist myself, I love seeing beautiful art, no matter what the medium is. The colors are vibrant, there is a lot of contrast in light and dark shades, the light sources are very realistic, which makes everything shine and glisten. The character designs are among the best I've ever seen, as they are simplistic, yet still contain plenty of detail so the viewer is never left wondering what a certain object is. The animation is very fluid, but can also become very rigid when it needs to.Characters: This is probably my favorite aspect of 'Your Name'. I fell in love and related with the characters so much and if anything tense or bad happened to them, I felt their pain and wanted nothing more than to see them pull through and come out the other end fine. Never in any kind of movie (live action, animated) have I ever felt this way about any of the characters, and that really says a lot of about the writing and voice acting. These aren't even physical people on the screen, and I'm getting worked up about them like I've known them for yearsSound:I've been listening to the music quite a lot recently, and it's really beautiful. Mesmerizing piano melodies, soulful string sections, with even some playful chords and melodies to match the more lighthearted and playful parts of the movie. It even has 2 original J-Pop songs that I've been really enjoying as of recently.Enjoyment:As you can probably already tell, I'm in love with this movie. I've never loved a movie's characters and plot as much as this. The plot takes many twists and turns, but never strays away from the true message of the film, and keeps you on your toes and keeps you hooked and in love with the whole packageOverall:This movie is a true masterpiece of cinema and rightfully deserves all the awards it's received. This is a movie that has nothing wrong with it. No flaws or things I wish they'd done differently or better. I'm looking forward to more re-watches of the movie.10/10"
" Not horrible, but didn't knock my socks off either
",2018-04-30 00:00:00,7,"I've seen quite a few Japanese movies. This one was just ok in my book. You know that feeling when you lose interest in a movie and wish it was over? That's how this movie was about 3/4 of the way through. It was compelling in some ways, but in the end it turned out to be mediocre. Think the 8.4 rating at this point is a bit high."
" No Spoiler
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Just made an IMDb account just to give this movie a 10. I've never reviewed any movie online before. But this movie is a perfect 10, and if you haven't watched it then you're missing out on so much."
" Great
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Amazing rjsjshoa skka aka aja
Would recommend to anyone,great music by radwimps as well.Plot was great, satisfactory ending"
" Disappointing
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,5,"Disclaimer: I am not a fan of anime. I like Studio Ghibli, but only because their films can be enjoyed and even loved by people who don't typically like anime. Having said that, the animation in this movie is flat-out amazing. Every frame is a work of art, demonstrating unbelievable mastery of the film medium. Though a visual masterpiece, Your Name's flaws are, unfortunately, wide-ranging and deep. In fact, the movie's convoluted plot, poor choice of songs, unappealing characters, and off-putting, melodramatic tone make it a chore to sit through. I realize anime is not for everyone, but this movie really didn't connect with me. And it's not just because it's an anime film. It's because it's a movie whose plot and characters fail to engage the viewer in any meaningful way, whose soundtrack, tone, and overall style actively resist any attempt made by the viewer to enjoy the movie. If you decide to watch this movie, I hope you like it more than I did. Visually, there is a lot to appreciate. The movie is so good visually, I regret that I am not able to leave it a better review."
" One of the best animated movies I have ever seen
",2018-04-20 00:00:00,9,"Every few days, a girl from a small Japan town wakes up in the body of a Tokyo boy, and soon realizes that at the same time he takes over hers. On these occasions, they have to live each other's day, trying not to cause problems to each other. They begin to find ways to communicate with each other to make all this easier to work out. What they have yet to understand is that the situation is much more complicated than it first appears, and that on two of them depends survival of many people. I can not go deeper into the story to avoid spoilers, but believe me, you do not want to miss this movie. I really do not like anime, but this time I'm thrilled.9,5/10"
" Beautiful
",2018-04-14 00:00:00,9,"Ok, this is my first review of a movie, so maybe I'll be brief.The story is very well written, it just somehow feel like it does make sense. Kudos to the writer!The art is very well made, I don't find any awkwardness in every character's movement and interaction, it just feel so natural. Well, maybe that's just the standard quality for a good Japanese anime.The scenery is very beautiful, it somehow catch the very much of Japan in its depiction of Tokyo and the rural image of small town in Japan. I'm not Japanese myself, but I've been to Japan quite some times, and it feels very nostalgic to watch the scenery in this movie.The soundtrack is very nice, the music is very heartwarming and just click very well with the love story in the movie.Overall, I highly recommend this movie not just for anime lovers, but also for everyone."
" ""It's just a what-if fantasy, isn't it?""
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,7,"This anime film had an interesting premise with it's fantasy, time-travel concept, and in a way I was reminded of the 1980 Christopher Reeve/Jane Seymour movie, ""Somewhere in Time"". It starts out a little more complicated because it leaves the viewer somewhat confused until the characters themselves reveal what's going on, perhaps even more so through the dialog of their friends questioning the behavior of the principals. I will concede that the picture is rendered beautifully and the animation is exquisite. However the tenor of the film is geared in my estimation to a younger viewing audience, as so many anime films appear to be. That's not a negative, it's just that senior citizens like myself relate very little if at all to the characters in the story. However I found myself thinking that the same basic premise of the story would provide an exceptional opportunity for a live action film. I think the story would be easier to follow if the viewer could relate to live actors in real locations, as the animated nature of the picture tends to take one outside the boundaries of real life situations. Even so, I was entertained by the picture once I figured out what was going on with the body swapping and time dissonance. It's not hard to understand why this would have a wide appeal to a much younger audience."
" a sweet, mindbending, and all around great animated film
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,7,"From the crystal clear, beautifully crafted animation to the likability of the two protagonists to the tense drama to the light humor, this semi-love-story is lighthearted and very moving to the point of now being one of the most acclaimed films of recent years. And perhaps one of the most acclaimed films of all time. I had a couple of little problems w/it, thus making me avoid any statements about the film's status among cinema's finest efforts as they'd be rather hyperbolic coming from me, as well as simply just not genuine. Instead, however, I will happily praise the film on various levels. 
 As a technical achievement, it is stunning. The animation is spectacularly done in every scene, the characters are really alive, the scenery is beautiful, in general it is just a really fun movie to look at. There were a few surprisingly surreal and borderline psychedelic moments here and there in the film and they worked not only to further the plot but also to simply show off the massive tons of talent pouring itself into basically every shot of this movie. 
 Story-wise, it is also stunning. It's a mixture of a few genres. At first, it almost feels like some light slice-of-life type comedy w/a magical-realist twist, but eventually it becomes something much more emotional and dramatic than that. It becomes a film featuring multiple dimensions and complicated situations these two leads who I genuinely grew to adore and care for had to trudge their tense ways through. It is a supernatural drama and a love story on top, and a very unconventional love story at that (the way the romance of the film is handled is unlike almost any other romance I have seen; it is clear these two are in love, but they never express it openly at all). It really felt like the writer really matured over the course of writing this, which is as much a blessing as it is a curse, b/c it does mean that the film improves heavily w/every scene, but it also means that the beginning and early middle of this film are no where near as great as what follows. And, do not get me wrong, there's some super fun stuff in this roughly-first-half of the movie, but there's also a few eye rolling scenes and weird incorporations of pop songs and overtly expository dialogue and non-endearingly cheesy moments that I just could not get into. Thus, my score drops down by a single point. It is still, obviously, a wonderful movie, and sort of a must see for lovers of animation and world cinema in general."
" Nothing But Good Storyline
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,9,"Addicted to the excellent story, a love suspense story, we can say that. Too superficial, I also have to point out."
" What am I missing?
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,3,I can't get past the awful voice characterizations - all the grunting and what you usually have in American dubbed anime. The artwork and animation is stunning but can't hold my attention.
" I regret watching it.
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,10,"Not because it was bad. Because now I have a craving for Anime movies similar in nature to this one, but I can't find any that are truly as well produced as this. There are other good titles for sure, but none of them have touched me quite like this one. I feel like the characters, staring at the sky longing for something that I just can't find."
" A stunning work of art, in both animation and storyline
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,8,"This has become one of my favourite anime ever. Not only was the storyline AMAZING and made me cry, but the detail into the animation itself is beautiful. I admit that I was skeptical at first, but it wasn't long into the movie where I had really gotten into it. There's also a lot of information to take in, so I would suggest when watching you pay full attention so you don't miss anything (not that you'd want to).
I was also very pleased with the ending. I'm not going to spoil anything, but i know how much a bad ending can ruin an entire film, so I'll just say that you'll be satisfied.
I 100% recommend this film, but I would warn you, if you're emotional like me you probably may want to keep some tissues nearby (I cried like a baby)."
" An epic love story
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,9,Your name (Kimi no Na wa) is one of the most beautiful animated movies out there and is worth watching!
" Necessary to watch!
",2018-03-14 00:00:00,10,"I never thought I will write a review anywhere in my life.. But this movie is magnificent, it is the best thing I have ever watched. Hopefully I will see more movies like this in the future.. Full of feelings.. I never cried so much. 100% Recommended movie to everyone."
" Wistful, poignant and ultimately uplifting; beautifully animated and wonderfully inventive.
",2018-03-12 00:00:00,8,"There's a distinct and slightly jarring protagonist switch just far enough in for you to really notice it, but it's a testament to 'Your Name (2016)' that - though it could have been ironed out relatively easily with some structural smoothing or a slightly simpler two-handed approach - this is perhaps its only real issue and it isn't even all that detrimental, considering that it allows us to develop a proper emotional connection to both leads from an internal perspective, actually mirroring the fantastical conceit driving the beautifully animated and wonderfully inventive narrative. The piece is a joy to watch and takes a number of turns that are genuinely unexpected. It's a wistful, soulful and poignant experience that's also an entertaining and, ultimately, uplifting one. It does seem to say something quite profound while always managing to delight and mystify with its deftly handled story and properly stirring themes. 8/10"
" Amazing
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,10,"The suspense was killing me, i absolutely loved it."
" Whatever you expect from this movie, it will be a thousand times better!
",2018-03-06 00:00:00,10,"First of all, i must say that anime and animation movies are not my cup of tea, but my gf loves them! So i watched quite a few with her. Now, take in consideration that my account is 8 years old and i never bothered to write a review on any movie.. BUT this movie surely deserves one!First things out, the movie opening with some beautiful animation and amazing soundtrack! 10 seconds in the movie, and im already 110% in it. Music is amazing throughout the movie and it massively adds on tension. I give music choice 10+ Animation is done surprisingly well. Dancing parts are top notch. Running, talking. Everything looks so smooth and amazingly done. Characters are quite believable and you'll love every single one of them. Even the side ones that show only for a few seconds. Their dialog is neat for as much as i could understand it. 10 for animation and characters. Now the story. It reminded me of Life Is Strange, which is probably my favorite game of all time ( even the music choice was similar ) because it has so much story and character involvement. And this movie succeeded in every aspect of character development, but i must say that story was redundant at some points. I dig sci-fi parts of it, but movie could've ended sooner than it was the run time and it would still be an amazing movie. It's like they needed some scenes just to fill the run time. NOW, don't get me wrong, story was excellent, it keeps you rooting for protagonist/s all the time. You'll feel sad at the time, you'll laugh, you'll be mad at some points.. there'll also be some ex-machina-ing. But overall, i give 9.5 for story. Overall 10/10. A movie you must watch if you haven't. It will make your day if not a week, and surely give you something to daydream about"
" Emotionally moving love story
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,9,"I don't often write reviews but I don't remember the last time a movie made me tear up so much. I felt like the characters at some points 'overrun with emotions' and with subconsciously teary eyes. 
Everything in the movie was brilliant, the animation, the scenery and most of all the plot. The themes through the movie were strong, such as the talk of the threads of time or the ribbon, and much of the plot that at the time didn't seem very relevant came back in a way to remind the viewer. The ending was elusive too, I wished that they would remember each other and meet but weather they would or not remained uncertain.
I won't spoil what happened but I can confidently say its one of the best animated movies I've ever watched and I've watched several. Many of the themes felt similar to 5 Centimeters Per Second and if you liked that movie you'll definitely like this one."
" A brilliant piece of art.
",2018-03-01 00:00:00,10,"Kimi No Na Wa (or Your Name in english) is an amazing film that takes you on an emotional roller coast through it. The story has been meticulously crafted, even when your confused you feel it still makes sense. The characters are deep, emotional characters and feel very real. By the end of the film you feel all kinds of emotions. It also looks amazing. The style and animation are flawless and feel perfect. My only complaint with this film would be its ending (I will not spoil it). But other than that it is a masterpiece and I implore you to watch it if you a fan of Anime or just films in general."
" Your Name is phenomenal, so close to perfection.
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,9,"Suffice to say I used to hate anime, I couldn't get on board with it. Now that I feel I've grown as an aspiring film critic, I can appreciate the delicate art of Japanese animation. With Hayao Miyazaki retired, is the genre deceased? Far from it. Your Name is just as good as any Miyazaki production. Two teenagers unexpectedly switch lives, forging a connection that is both unexplainable and unforgettable. Having figured out what's happening, the two attempt to meet...but not everything in life is that simple. A gorgeous juxtaposition of culture and gender. A country girl and a city boy. A tranquil and picturesque rural town against a bustling and modernised Tokyo. Contrasting the difference in mannerisms and punctuality, not just in lifestyles, but in gender. How a girl and a boy interact with others differently. Two lives being thrown into a foreign environment. The sheer complexity and magnitude that the narrative conveys is nothing short of genius. The introductory title song plays and BAM...I was captivated instantaneously. The animation...the animation!? It was like watching art move right before my eyes. Anime has never looked so beautiful. The glistening water, fast moving transport, hallucinogenic comets against a starry backdrop...wow. Wooooow! I can't. It's too much. I think my eyes are bleeding, someone pass me a tissue. Shinkai's direction was utterly creative. The story moves along at a swift pace and the inclusion of time-bending realities just makes it that much more intriguing. It's a love story. How love can traverse both space and time. Honestly, it was beautiful to watch. To create a pure relationship from two souls switching bodies is...well damn difficult. Shinkai made it look easy. Some of the time-bending narrative shifts can be confusing and you may not necessarily understand it in one viewing (heck, I didn't completely) but the film is that good, that you will want to watch it again...and again...and again. Aside from some exposition, Your Name is masterful."
" The best anime in history!
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,10,"The best I've ever seen! The producer that came up with this tragic story and managed to implement it in reality, really a GREAT man! I am endlessly fascinated by his magical story of two soul mates finding each other! It is impossible to Express in words how grateful I am to the producer of this wonderful story! If my review reads the man who doubts whether to watch this anime, it's that person I without delay answer: definitely worth it! This is the greatest work of art, and if I had the opportunity, I would have given the producer 32 Oscars at once! I, as a person, really pleased with this anime with bated breath waiting for the next masterpiece from this producer! I sincerely wish him further progress and success,and I give producer a huge thank you for being able to please such a demanding person as I am, I recommend this anime to view!"
" Fantastic
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,10,"Great animation, great storyline. The space-time connection works wonderfully. And even the change in the time-line makes sense. The dream state that is and is not, the memory fades,... the whole thing is perfectly executed and works like precise clockwork. Excellent at all levels."
" A big success in terms of visuals, audio and story
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,8,"""Kimi no na wa."" or ""Your Name"" is a Japanese anime movie that premiered in 2016 already and it took until now, early 2018, to make it to Germany, but the waiting was worth it. Writer and director here is Makoto Shinkai and this was his 5th full feature movie I believe and judging from the quality, I am not surprised that he is considered the next Miyazaki by many, even without the contribution of Studio Ghibli here. This was really a beautiful watch. It runs for 105 minutes approximately and takes us into the lives of a Japanese male teenager living in Tokyo and a female teenager living in the countryside. With a comet approaching Planet Earth, these two seem to be switching mind and bodies as a consequence of their dreams. This results in some pretty funny moments early on, but adds considerable gravity to the whole story the longer the film goes on, at least starting that very moment when we find out how they are not living during the exact same time. So it is a definitely a drama movie, even if Shinkai did really fine in using several established approaches to get in comedy too like the recurring boob humor that is executed so thoughtfully that it works very well and never feels cheesy or even offensive, then the scenes in which we see how female characters can get interested in something so enthusiastically or also thought process of recent mentions in a way you see on Family Guy, but in anime style of course.But now about the more crucial factors here. I watched the German dub and I thought the voice actors did a really good job. The music was really beautiful to listen to most of the time and the soundtrack added a great deal of class to the film and many individual scenes. And in terms of the plot, the twist towards the darker, more dramatic side the film takes around the one-hour mark is one that worked incredibly well too while before that it was more entertaining for the sweetness, funny mannerisms of the characters and just the exploration of the whole situation. The element of death that is included afterward is one that will have you glued to the screen as it also adds a great deal in terms of character development. The eternal parallel between beauty and destruction was one that was mesmerizing. The moment the comet eventually hit the place and we were nearby to see it not knowing how many died and how many survived was one of the best of the entire film year to me. But this parallel I just mentioned also applies in terms of the subject of dreams, a very crucial one in here. As quickly as your memories are irrevocably destroyed, as sweet and breathtaking and special may your dreams be. There is no way to keep them though as the memory fades quickly and this is something I experienced so many times in real life too, which is why the film made an even bigger impact on me from that perspective. It was not a perfect film, but all criticisms I have with it are just minor really and probably entirely subjective, so I won't mention them in detail, so that you won't recognize them even perhaps from your standpoint. What else? Oh yes, all the characters are really likable and fun to watch and there is great charm to this movie in my opinion, lots of magic. It is also a film I am sure where you will see something new every time regardless of it being the second time you see it or the 20th time. I don't think that how much I liked it has to do here with my preference for anime or Japanese films and Japan in general, so you can also enjoy it without these preferences, but it obviously helps. The ending was slightly predictable that the film stops the moment they meet in real life for the very first time, but that does not make it bad. There were 2 or 3 moments before that too when the film could have ended and it would have been as good, maybe even better, but the actual ending is very good nonetheless. Overall, this was a touching, sweet, shocking, funny movie and it was really all I could hope for. I am really glad I got the chance to see it on the big screen as this is where it is far more effective than on a small laptop or television screen I'm sure. Still it is better seeing it there too than not seeing it at all. A definite contender for best animated feature from 2016 and boo to the Oscars and all the other awards bodies not showing it any love. This movie is a true thing of beauty and I highly highly recommend seeing it. And yes, it is an animated movie that is more for grown-ups than for kids for sure. Don't miss out here."
" one amazing movie
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,10,"I almost did not see this movie because i tough it was about a romance, but far from it the story is very good and the ending too."
" Totally loss of time
",2018-02-12 00:00:00,2,"The storyline is so stupid...
Storyline 1/10
Animation is the only good thing 9/10
Music 5/10
If you are 12-14 years old girl,then its what you are looking for..."
" Weaker than other Japanese anime films
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,6,"In this animated film, Mitsuha is a teenage girl living in a rural mountainous area of Japan. Taki is a teenage boy living in Tokyo. At various times, the two switch bodies.The animation in this film is beautiful and there are clever moments in the film as well. When the story is comprehensible, it can be engaging. The trouble, as just implied, is that it is often difficult to understand. It's not always easy to know when each character is their real self or whether they are possessed by the other. To make matters even more difficult, the exchange is happening in different time lines three years apart.I might have used the excuse that I'm not that familiar with Japanese Anime films but that won't work as I've probably seen at least a half-dozen of them. My favourite is ""Only Yesterday"" (1991) which happened to have no supernatural elements. Among those with magical content, I have great admiration for ""Spirited Away"" (2001) and ""My Neighbor Totoro"" (1988).The two latter films had special universes that were bizarre but fascinating. Most importantly, they were always understandable and consistent - characteristics that are missing in ""Your Name""."
" Unexpectedly good
",2018-02-07 00:00:00,9,"I didn't expect expect to like this movie as much as I did. The animation is stunning, the story is engaging and the movie complements everything perfectly.Watch it, you'll find yourself captivated."

" Movie of the year
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,10,"Your Name is one of my favorite movies of all time and will always have a special place in my heart. Its animation, soundtrack, story, everything about it is just amazing and something barely seen. The Idea that the two main characters switch bodies every once in a while is something almost never seen in anime and it pulls it off perfectly. It has one of the biggest twists and a very satisfying ending that will keep you on your toes for the whole of part 2 just to get to it. You can tell that there was an immense amount of effort and passion put into this film and I beg you to watch this masterpiece."
" Amazing
",2018-01-30 00:00:00,10,I created an IMDB account to comment on this movie. It's amazing.
" A very pleasant surprise!
",2018-01-30 00:00:00,10,"I'm not used to write movies' reviews but this one deserved with huge merits. After read other reviews, I encouraged myself to do the same. Although I have been always a anime fan, this movie surpassed my highest expectations. My wife was a little hesitant at the beginning, but she was truly amazed. 
Although I watched the Spanish dubbed version, the dialogues kept the main essence of the story and the characters delivered a wonderful performance. The visuals were magnificent, for both environments (Tokyo and Itomori). The premise of the movie seemed quite simple and repetitive, but I didn't see this coming. My wife and I were in suspense until the very last minute of the movie. It is a must-watch definitively."
" A good anime film

If domestic to release the animated film, just appreciate the picture, is fare enough (but really in the domestic release, but people still can't see the wallpaper slasher images abroad cry).The first time I saw it, it was very shocking, whether it was the quality of the picture or the plot.
As delicate as the picture is the expression of subtle emotions. Palace water trilobites and tachibana Long after spirit spatio-temporal crisscross exchange have slowly bake out, and the last time the two constantly miss eventually break the deadlock when will miss the whole SOB warmth; It is a pity to have osimeji not to be married to others; He has ordered him to take the early yeomen with his name, and his little love for the three leaves of the palace. There is a palace water one leaf palace water three leaf and palace water four leaf thick affection; The little gay love between fujii and taki... These subtle emotions are shown in the film through the characters' language, expression and behavior, and the complex knot between people also enriches the whole film."
" Everything I want a movie to be
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,10,"I'll be honest with you, I'm not the biggest fan of anime. Not in the sense that I particularily dislike it but rather in the sense that I haven't seen that many anime shows or movies. Of course I've seen most of the Ghibli films but that's pretty standard even for a normie like me. In terms of Makoto Shinkai I hadn't seen a whiff before I saw Your Name (Kimi no na wa). However this one reached such an unsual amount of praise and attention compared to other anime films that even I got curious after some time. Could this movie be worth all the hype? Could it appeal even to someone relatively unversed in anime? And the answer was a thousand times yes! Your Name contains everything you could ask for out of any movie, not just animated ones. Romance, heart, passion, visual splendor, suspense, humour and much more. Many of these things have been lacking in most recent Hollywood movies as they seem to be getting more and more transparent in how safe they're playing it and how unpassionate their films are. I never thought to look to a whole other culture to find all these things that I've wanted more of for so long, but here we are! Your Name is beautiful in every sense of the word. Firstly from a visual standpoint. By now I've seen quite a few Shinkai movies and they all look really great, but man does he outdo himself here! Every movement looks fluent, every colour is expressive and vibrant, every expression on the faces of the characters looks natural. The whole movies is gorgeous because of all of these things, but the final act is where it really pops thanks to the grand epic scale of what is happening on screen. But perfect visuals are nothing without a good story, and thankfully Your Name has it. You've probably heard that the premise is that a boy named Taki and a girl named Mitsuha start switching bodies inexplicably. I think you should watch this movies with a clear mind, so I won't say anymore, just know that there's more to it than that, and the film takes many unexpected twists and turns. Also I need to touch on the fantastic soundtrack by RADWIMPS. I wasn't sure if their music would work well together with this rather dramatic and lofty premise, but the music is such a perfect fit for the visuals and it always seems to exactly match the emotion that is being created by the scene. I have all the songs on my playlists now and I listen to them practically every day during my spare time, it's that good!By the end of the film I felt like I had had such a complete experience. I had been laughing, I had been moved deeply by the dramatic scenes and I had been gasping at the visual spectacle. I really do not know how anybody could watch this film and end up finding nothing to like, it really does feel like there is something here for everyone. What I ask most of all out of any movie, is to entertain me and to move me, and Your Name did that better than most movies I have ever seen. It really did give me everything I could possibly want!"
" Distinctive music and woderful spot

I love how the characters change for the better after knowing each other Mitsuha became more confident and serene thanks to him and Taki became more empathic and calm thanks to her they're both opposites still they complete and elevate each other, a beautiful illustration of what love should be. already a classic and I don't get the Oscars snub!"

" Eye-catcher
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,7,"Japanese hand-drawn anime featuring a slightly unusual take on the freaky-friday-esque body swapping trope.In a continuous string of well-drawn dualities on one hand you have Mitsuha, a girl from a small town engrossed in a traditional Shinto upbringing; on the other you have Taki a boy from ultra-modern Tokyo working part-time as a waiter.The small town is realised with a soft, dreamy sunshine-streaked palette; Tokyo as near photo-realist and futuristic - in both cases, the visuals are handled with real care & attention and quite noticeable: it's a visual treat.The plot follows 3 main stages, of the 2 main characters realising their predicament, developing each others lives in some way and eventually Taki's efforts to find Mitsuha in the 'real' world. (they can't remember each other's names, hence the title)Some unexpected turns are found and it really ramps up the tension for a thriller of a denouement.
The voice work here (dubbed into English) is standard fare, and the sound track super poppy which for whatever reason I found faintly amusing.Very engaging overall and a nice compact running time, recommended."
" Fantastic but not perfect
",2018-01-15 00:00:00,8,"Recently I've been reviewing the films I watch as soon as I can after watching them as a way of channelling my thoughts.I've just finished 'Your Name' and have to agree with a lot of people on here, it's quite fantastic. The story and themes are very interesting and I found the film kept me engaged with shifts in tone / plot that felt natural and paced well.Additionally the animation is gorgeous and a lot of the music was achingly beautiful.However, some of the music (mainly the poorly timed pop ballads) felt out of place and actually served to draw me out of the experience as a whole. Some of the ballads worked but I felt the orchestral music alone would did a great job on the emotional cue's of the film. Furthermore, I think the characters were slightly two-dimensional (or not as individualised as they could have been) and the story falls into a familiar and rather cheesy conclusion, but it fit the tone of the film overall, it just wasn't entirely believable. Other than that it's a great watch and I'd happily watch again, it's a lovely film and does a great job at sucking you into its world.4/5"

" One of the best stories you will ever watch
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,10,"I watched this movie when it was released on Netflix mostly because of all the reviews praising so much. I didn't knew the director, studio or whoever was involved.
From the first minutes, I became amazed on such a fresh and original ""situation"" (not gonna reveal spoilers), but the premise was good enough to make a decent, funny anime. Yet, when the movie goes on, you are presented with a way more complex, intriguing, breath taking moments, not to mention the last 20 minutes, which literally will have your heart pounding and probably crying
The characters are extremely well developed, the scenarios are excellently drawn, animated, the soundtrack for the most comic/dramatic events...everything is just excellent. 
This movie will probably become a cult on its own, I still can't believe that such a good story was told in less than two hours, I've seen animes of 25 or so episodes that are not even close"

Novel, compelling, beautifully constructed and achingly sweet, this is a gorgeous blend of young love, loss, destiny and a fate that twists to the end. A joy to watch."
" A Tale of Transcending limits and emotions.
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,10,"YOUR NAME proves to be much more than a generic coming-of-age love
story. Firstly, it's the clever use of two timelines, intertwined and
overlapped, to achieve a rendezvous for the two protagonists. Secondly,
the animation and music are so exquisitely used to accentuate the
general aesthetics of the film, that it keeps the viewers' gazes glued
to the screen. The movie was recommended to me by a friend, and I hadn't expected to
be blown away the way I did. The film is a clever mix of core romance
and subtle comedy, with a tint of highly bizarre storytelling which
keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. I believe, above
everything else, the script and storytelling rocks it for Your Name.
The crucial importance of culture and heritage, the metaphorical use of
'twisted braids' as time, and the contrast between the Tokyo life and
Itomori life, are undebatable winners in this one. I had said YOUR NAME is not a 'Generic coming-of-age love story'. No
its definitely not. Rather its a modern Love story unfolding with
transcending limits and emotions."
" Another expertly-made anime
",2017-12-16 00:00:00,6,"YOUR NAME is another expertly-made anime that hails from Japan and is similar to the high quality of other recent animated drama from that country. The story is about two teenagers, one male and one female, who randomly find themselves swapping bodies on one fateful date and must subsequently investigate their bizarre circumstances. It sounds like a cheesy body-swap romance and indeed I've seen it described as such, but that description doesn't do the film justice. Body-swapping plays a part and there's even some high school tenderness, but this wide-reaching picture also explores themes of disaster, loss, tragedy, family, mythology, and long-distance relationships. It's been made in an exemplary fashion with perfect animation and voice acting, so it's very difficult to criticise it overall."
" Not my type of anime movie but still good enough
",2017-12-13 00:00:00,7,"Yesterday I decided to finally get round and watch this movie. I have to say it was pretty decent for what it was but it could have been better if it wasn't so long and confusing.
Like how was one head ribbon making the boy and the girl switch places?
Why was the girls father a massive douche bag by just yelling at her for not walking properly. All of this time travel and them forgetting there names were just confusing. Why did the boy write ""I love you"" on the girls hand instead of his name? The two main characters barely had chemistry or development with one another as they were rarely seen together.However the voice acting and animation to the movie was pretty good.
Even though there are a few dodgy scenes in the movie. Including a scene when the girl vomits rice in a bowl and when the boy drinks the girls spit. It should have been 1 hour 30 minutes instead and watching a video of a bulldog summarises this whole movie in 13 seconds. Not saying Your Name is a bad movie or anything but it's definitely not an award winning either. I don't hate the movie I am just indiffrent to it. Good day!"
" Reasonably interesting, but not great
",2017-12-12 00:00:00,6,"A teenage boy living in Tokyo and a teenage girl living in the country experience a strange, random phenomenon. They occasionally switch bodies for a day at a time, and then can't remember what happened while they were switched. The boy eventually sets out to find the girl, but the situation may be even more peculiar than he imagined.Reasonably interesting, though not overly engaging and quite schmaltzy. The switching places plot device didn't seem too original, reminding me of movies like Freaky Friday, and was often just a basis for silliness. However, once the plot progressed past the cheap fun part, the plot gained some intrigue. It didn't quite live up to its potential in that regard, resorting to clumsily layered cleverness and random departures to create a feeling of ingenuity, when this was really more style than substance. Still, did make it fairly interesting.Unfortunately there is a whole lot of trite schmalziness and empty sentimentality too, probably because the movie is aimed at the teenage market. In the end it feels a like Freaky Friday meets Christopher Nolan, dumbed down for teenagers. By aiming for a broader audience and avoiding the schmaltz, this could have been great. Instead it is just okay."
" Regularly entertaining
",2017-12-08 00:00:00,5,"I am very conflicted with this film. On one hand I liked the technical aspects of it: it's music, color, scenery and amazing animation. All of that is good. On the other, I didn't liked the story, for me it was too forced and melodramatic. Of course not all of it is bad, the characters were OK and some moments were entertaining. But when I look back at the film, the bad moments overshadow the good ones. I think that my main problem is that the ""fantastic"" aspect of it was used as a plot device. It gave the movie a good premise but it also took a lot of fun from it. For me, it felt that it didn't had rules, that the movie was just inventing something new all the time and improvising its own plot. They didn't even gave an explanation for many of the things in the film.Another think I didn't liked is that it feels like this movie is manipulating you into crying. Of course, every movie manipulates us in a certain way. But here it is very obvious, this is proved by its use of very melodramatic music and constant uses of over dramatic monologues. I didn't hated this movie, I just thought that it wasn't as good as it could have been. Kimi no na wa had an interesting premise but its story is what holds it from being good. Maybe if it was told another way, for example like a mystery, it could have been better."
" Breath-Taking film... amazing and beautiful!
",2017-12-07 00:00:00,10,"Beware this master piece will leave u all in tears!!. I wish more stories like this are made into animation or movies, such a phenomenal and outstanding story. 10 points all the way!!!.You fall in love with this movie the moment it starts and the love keeps getting stronger and stronger as the plot unfolds, and in the end you just wish that it should never end. Loved every moment of the movie!!!"
" Not a huge fan of anime, or animated movies in general, but I did like this film.
",2017-11-30 00:00:00,8,"'YOUR NAME': Four Stars (Out of Five)The blockbuster Japanese animated fantasy drama, about a high school girl, in rural Japan, and a high school boy, in Tokyo, that switch bodies. The film was written and directed by acclaimed Japanese filmmaker Makoto Shinkai. It's gotten almost unanimous rave reviews from critics and fans alike, and it's also broken Box Office records all around the world (including becoming the 4th highest grossing film in Japan's history). I enjoyed the film as well.Mitsuha (Stephanie Sheh) is a high school student that lives in Itomori, a rural town in the mountains of Japan. She is very unhappy with small town life, and dreams of moving to Tokyo. Taki (Michael Sinterniklaas) is a high school student living in Tokyo, that also works at a local Italian restaurant (part-time). He aspires to become an architect. One day the two magically switch places, thinking it's just a dream, and their lives are never the same again. I'm not a huge fan of anime, or animated movies in general, but I did like this film. I can definitely see why it's such a huge hit at the Box Office too, and with critics, and not just in Japan. Of course they're already planning an American remake as well (with J.J. Abrams producing). The switching bodies story gimmick has been done many times before, but the body swapping of a male and female high school student seems somewhat fresh and original. Where the filmmakers take the story is also interesting and involving. There's of course some silly coming-of-age humor in it too, and it's far from a perfect movie, but it's definitely a well made and entertaining one (in my opinion).Watch a new episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xsOj7IhB5us"
" A masterpiece!
",2017-11-29 00:00:00,10,"It's really a wonderful movie in many ways. The idea, vision, script, visuals, direction, music, and emotions. I really loved it! I just finished it, but, I want to watch it again and again. It's a masterpiece that we didn't watch something like it for a while. It's a must-see, not because of my opinion or yours or anybody's, but because it's a piece of art that captures your mind, heart, and soul. And let you live an incredible dream!"
" No Words..
",2017-11-24 00:00:00,10,"I wanted to write a review but I am busy watching this movie a 6th time.Well i need more lines.This movie is awesome. I have never felt like watching a movie 2nd time let alone 6 times.The animation,the story, everything is on point. Note: Do watch till at least 25-30 minutes. A lot of people don't get it the first few minutes and end up missing such a beauty."
" 1 love 2 hearts
",2017-11-23 00:00:00,10,"As I delve into Anime at the tender age of 35(!) I notice a certain degree of passion driving these films. This is no exception. And yes! This film makes to believe that love can save the world! It's a bit cheesy at times but I take it as it is because of the Japanese humour! I must add though that I have never willed 2 characters to fall in love so bad! The film is endearing but also very intelligent. I recommend it. Though it is a slow burner, so give it your time & attention & it won't fail to move you."
" Very touching love story with sci fi elements.
",2017-11-21 00:00:00,8,"I really loved this film and that surprised me since I am not an anime fan in general. But, I am a love story fan. I was a little averse to the subtitles at first but once I started, it was easy to watch and really get into it. There are features in this film as deep as some of the most deep ones in American love stories and sci-fi. The concept draws you in immediately and if you pay attention, it starts to flow and flow and what a fun ride it is.It uses some elements we have seen in a new way and the anime really helps to that end. I have to tell you that after about 5 minutes in, I forgot the characters were animation, they seemed real to me.I found the two main characters charming. Again, I am not much of an anime fan. I have seen many of them but they aren't my first choice. This would not only appeal to young lovers, like maybe those in love for the first time, but it will also rekindle those adolescent/young adult feelings in anyone who gives it a chance.If you examine my history at IMDb or my own sites you'll see I am not new at recommending films. Take it from me, this is an instant classic. The artwork is also way above the usually anime bar. Some of the special effects had to be done by paintbrush, or by hand however they did it. It was a feast for the eyes and the story did not suffer.Having said all that, if you can't give it your attention or you really have no interest to sit and watch subtitles, this probably isn't for you.Give this film your full attention as a love story with some sci fi elements and you will not regret it."
" Incredibly engaging...
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,10,"A visually breathtaking and emotionally resilient slice of life with a twist of fantasy, complex characterization, and a mesmeric soundtrack. Incredibly engaging, it drove me to tears. It's up there with Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke as one of the greatest anime films, at least in my opinion. It's beyond me how the Oscars overlooked this masterpiece."
" A Good Anime That Is About To Be Ruined
",2017-11-17 00:00:00,8,"A good anime that has a message, interesting characters, authenticity despite retelling a niche sub-genre story. The work that has gone into and the originality are appreciated. What was less impressive was the stoic reactions and matter-of-fact behaviours. With that said this is quite an accomplishment and I know that with the announced Hollywood remake we the fans need to boycott the coming movie. Hollywood has to learn that their predatory attack on anything popular for their infamous remake series will not be tolerated. Look how they mocked Ghost In The Shell (rolling my eyes as I write)."
" Everything in this movie is
superficial, just pr...
",2017-11-16 00:00:00,1,"Everything in this movie is  superficial, just pretty imagery and emotional music trying to pull  your heart strings. The characters in this movie are generic stoic anime  characters, and they are extremely underdeveloped at that.The movie  wastes time with these stupid mtv moments, were some bands songs  will start playing and everything goes into fast forward.It's a  complete waste considering that time could have been spent developing  the paper thin characters a little more. Magic plays a big part in Your  Name because the writer couldn't figure out how to cover up all the  obvious plot holes.Magic always saves the day conveniently, and when  ever something goes wrong. It just feels contrived, like it's only  happening to make you feel sad.  Don't waste your time with this overrated trash, it's as shallow as a  porn star!"
" A visually pleasing film with depth, but with little weight
",2017-11-11 00:00:00,7,"As an avid follower of the works of Studio Ghibli, this film had much to live up to, especially considering its deeper themes and the exploration of a different, more subtle sort of romance between two individuals separated by time and space. Unfortunately, this film turned out exactly as I expected and feared, with an interesting storyline and basis, yet the characters, dialogue, and overall crafting of the story itself detracted from the overall quality. I will focus mainly on the negatives in this review, as there are a plethora of other reviews that seem to only focus on the highlights.The main issue that I had with Your Name was the script. Having seen it both in the original Japanese with English subtitles, and also dubbed (on my second viewing) with the English voice actors, I was really hoping for the proper brevity and gravity that Studio Ghibli so constantly delivers. However, I was met with the characters stuck in an endless loop of telling viewers what they were feeling, and especially in the more intimate moments of the film, where this could have been left more to the viewers deduction – if someone is crying for a particular reason, it is often best left for the viewers to decide why; the character does not always need to vocalise their feeling in order to convey them. For this reason, I felt that I had very little attachment to the characters in a setting where attachment to the characters was vital.Furthermore, I believe that very little of the humour in this movie worked for the better. As I stated before, in a movie as heartfelt and intimate as this, the dialogue and the humour should be handled with the utmost care, and most of the time throughout the movie, I felt as if it took you away from the story – by all means, there certainly would be moments of humour when a boy switches bodies with a girl and vice versa, but humour was not the purpose of this movie, and this should have been respected.One last, and slightly more subjective gripe, but I found the music choices to often be contradictory and 'annoying,' to say the least. I understand that the montage sequence, set to an upbeat pop/rock song is a common event in the world of anime, and having seen many anime outside of Studio Ghibli myself, I understand and respect this. However, with a movie such as your name, I found it only broke apart the emotional storyline, and in many ways, lost some of the viewers investment in the story. The piano sequence (the main theme, I believe?) was beautiful; why not exclusively keep the orchestral/piano score throughout the entire movie? Overall, Your Name was a very solid attempt at a very difficult premise, with beautiful visuals, a poorly handled storyline, and not much else. 7/10"
" Your Name
",2017-11-10 00:00:00,10,"This delightful Japanese animation follows two strangely interlinked lives; Mitsuha, a high school girl living in a rural area of Japan, and Taki, a similarly aged boy in Tokyo. They have never met but they somehow start switching places in their dreams. At first each thinks they are having strange but very realistic dreams but the following day as the 'dream' fades they are surprised when friends and family tell them that they had been behaving oddly the day before; not recognising anybody and not knowing where they are meant to be then each finds a note from the other. They continue to swap days until suddenly it stops Taki can't recall many details but he has a memory of the place Mitsuha lived and is drawn to find her. Armed with a sketch of the location he finds the village and learns a shocking truth it had been destroyed in a natural disaster three years previously and Mitsuha was amongst the five hundred people who died! He is determined to find a way to swap places again so he can save her.Anybody who has seen previous films from director Makoto Shinkai will immediately recognise the beautiful style of the artwork, with incredibly detailed backgrounds. Of course a good film must do more than 'look good' and this succeeds there too; the first half is a fun introduction to the characters and their situation. This is done with plenty of humour; the fact that they find themselves in bodies of the opposite gender is quickly handled in an amusing but not a crude manner. There are lots of delightful details such as while swapped they talk in different dialects and Taki talks like a girl of course this is better appreciated if you speak Japanese but is explained so non-Japanese speakers (like me) can realise that it is happening. The events that take place half way through the film come as quite a surprise and suddenly change to tone of the film. As Taki tries to find a way to save Mitsuha and her village it is far from obvious that he will be successful. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to older fans of good animation; the content isn't really unsuitably for younger viewers but it would probably be a bit confusing.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles; an English dub is also available on the DVD I bought."
" best movie of 2016

" A Beautiful Heartwarming Story - With A Social Conscience
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,9,"In a world dominated by stupid sequels, prequels and remakes it is film/anime like this that restores hope in today's entertainment.Not only it is emotional and feels real, it delivers a relevant message. I love the imagination and palette but also appreciate that it aims to remind us of social issues that we should be paying attention to.The only reason I don't give our heroes and their story a 10/10 is that I still feel a couple of Miyazaki movies (like Kiki, Chihiro and the racoon dogs) were just that much better and showed a little more imagination.Whatever the case I live in fear of the Hollywood announced remake by Hollywood hack JJ Abrams who has never shown any talent or vision. As with others I will ignore and boycott that coming insult and always cherish kimi no na wa."
" Your Name: Not as good as it should have been
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,6,"I'm a fan of studio Ghibli, I believe the likes of The Red Turtle (2016) and Grave Of The Fireflies (1988) are masterpieces so I like giving these types of similar animation a chance even if they aren't made by the same people.Your Name heavily reminds me of Ghiblis work, it has that beautiful animation style and emotion driven storyline.It tells the story of two high school students, one in Tokyo and one in a small village outside of the city whose lives are bizarrely connected. The movie successfully twists, turns and fascinates but when the credits rolled I found myself a tad underwhelmed.The concept, the animation, the beautiful soundtrack, it all promises more than it delivers.Your Name is by no means a bad film, it just flounders and doesn't seem to come close to its potential. It is beautiful, it is sweet and its some heartfelt stuff but the emotional tour de force I was expecting? Hardly.At time of writing its the 83rd highest rated movie on IMDb and won 10 of the 11 awards it was nominated for. Consider me somewhat surprised on both fronts.A sweet little animated tale all the same ideal for people who enjoy studio Ghibli's work due to the similarities.The Good: Sweet opening credits Great soundtrack Very likable The Bad:Underwhelming Should have been better Things I Learnt From This Movie:When you find yourself singing along to a song in a language you don't speak nor understand you may have a problem"

" Beauty of this love story...
",2017-10-20 00:00:00,10,Its not what i expected from the anime...thought that it would be a BASIC love story of a boy and a girl BUT the thing that made me appreciate this movie is that it links the Past and Present. The comedic factor brings all this together. When both the characters forgot about each other after saving the city it broke my heart that they wont meet each other again as i knew that they were meant for each other. But Love brought them together and the spark was still there ..... truly blessed that i saw this wonderful piece of art. Recommend this to watch at lest once .
" Touching and stunning
",2017-10-18 00:00:00,9,"I am not a huge anime fan. But this movie is one for everyone, it is a must see. The visuals are phenomenal, music is catchy and the story is heartbreaking. The story is about a boy who switches his body with a girl he does not know, but not for always only in some periods. There are so much funny situations, but all in one its sad and depressing. I would suggest the movie to all anime enthusiasts and who love the visuals."
" Beautifully Detailed and Enjoyable for Non-Anime Fans
",2017-10-17 00:00:00,8,"Your Name is one of the most ornate and detailed anime films I've ever watched, providing a beautifully told story of two distant yet intertwined Japanese young adults. On a few instances the plot falls into trope territory, likely to happen when you combine the stories of Freaky Friday and anime high school plots, but there's some great surprises, and an enjoyable ending and character motivations."

" A taste of youth once again
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,9,"I have read quite a few reviews from both side before writing mine; I could understand why some people dislike this movie.For those who love this movie, they are those viewers who flow with the story with an open mind. There are always flaws in every story, if we keep nitpicking the plot hole, they will never come to appreciate what a movie could offer to them.People seems to forget the reason to watch a movie - to escape from our reality. This movie does deliver a moment for the audience to get along this amazing journey of Mitsuha and Taki. My wife and I try to solve the puzzle when the story continue to unfold, there were a few moment that we were able to put pieces together and see if the story goes as we thought. There were also moment we doubted whether the event will be different than it originally was. We hold our breath to see how the story will end, I was crossing my finger that the ending will be at least in some form of closure. I am glad that it was.Referring back to my review's title, by walking through this story, I could feel, once again, the energy by being youth. I am in my mid 40s and this movie touch my soul and brought my heart out as in my 20s.For those who can't stand any flaw in the story line, I believe this movie will not able to touch your heart or I should say, this is not your cup of tea."
" The most beautiful thing i have ever seen in an animated feature, Stunning.
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,10,"So much enticing, so much heart breaking yet so well crafted that this beauty never diminishes till the end. I had not such expectations that this animated feature would tend to be so alluring let alone carving a scar on my heart with such a graceful story line. By the time i was half way through the movie, my world of imagination and consciousness was turned upside down being totally engrossed in this art. Having a fondness towards anime series but an inclination to shun any kind of anime movie, I couldn't be more satisfied and contented with the decision of watching this sensational work of Makoto Shinkai, the writer and director.The way both the characters develop is so brilliantly constructed that it makes you ship for their union irresistibly. The plot was suffice enough for an Oscar nomination but i wonder why it wasn't. If you add up the animations, the plot twist. voice dub, and yes especially the music! The music is everything that makes it so much beyond heart warming. It really suits with the scenario and with the characters as well making it the real beauty that it is.If you are not familiar with animated movies or more precisely to say Japanese anime. This one will certainly get you started. I would definitely rank this as one of the best movies i have ever seen and undoubtedly place this as my best animated movie feature of all time. Definitely a piece to watch."
" Beyond words
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,10,"Just sit down and watch it. I don't like anime. I'm not an anime guy. So when I say that I watched this movie a year after it came out and it is now my top movie of 2016, that's saying a lot. This really comes to show how much more flexible animation is than live action. After watching this movie I really honestly consider animation (anime or not) to be the superior storytelling platform, and again I cannot stress this enough I Don't LIKE ANIME. This movie is beyond anything I had ever seen before and it took days to recover from the emotional destruction it brought me"
" I am confused
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,8,"This movie was confusing,at first i thought i was getting it easily but then it abruptly changed its momentum,it got quick with its story and that is probably why i failed to grasp it fully,i guess i need a second viewing,don't know when but i think i will give it another chance to get it from left to right,top to bottom."
" Beautiful images and...
",2017-09-03 00:00:00,7,"Is the cinema a vehicle for beautiful images independent of the narrative purpose of the film? Your Name is one of the most stunningly animated features I have ever seen, but the level of emotional resonance is somewhat far south of my favorite Studio Ghibli Films which this film purports to surpass (or equal.) What is the ultimate point of this movie? The body swapping story is obviously old-hat, but I felt it would lead to something grand, eventually. But (spoilers- don't read reviews when you don't want spoilers!) when the comet angle surfaced, I thought that things might finally get interesting. But instead, the film built up to a climax with basically a Get out of Jail Free Card idea. (I note that Taki summarily rejects a sexpot who is a great person from all evidence, and makes him look like an asshole in the process.) I recall that Isao Takahata's Only Yesterday was supposed to be a merely ""good"" animation from Studio Ghibli. Disney wouldn't even release it due to a frank discussion about female periods. But that film made me cry, and several times on a repeat viewing. Now, in that film's quiet, realistic, and understated style, why did I find such deep resonance, but a love story where a comet (spoilers!!!) wipes out an entire town cannot? I have to spread the blame around to all in Creative.That being said, this is a very good animated film from Japan, but I have to say it doesn't quite live up to its hype. It's a bit too emo and heavy handed. There are many parts where the lead characters scream out each other's name. There's no subtlety at all. Me thinks that the amazing images fool people when married to a heavy handed approach to presenting emotional content. Another refresher if you want an awesome coming of age story from Japanese masters, check out Whisper of the Heart. There's nothing in Your Name that matches the awe of Shizuku discovering the antique shop for the first time, and meeting the Baron... (sigh) This, without even bringing up Spirited Away."
" Hold onto that feeling
",2017-08-29 00:00:00,9,"Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world. Just a city boy... No, wait. Hear me out. Granted, it's initially hard to sell Your Name - a meet cute anime twist on Freaky Friday - as a worthwhile recipient of its considerable, well-deserved hype, rather than a big screen, big budget rendition of Fruits Basket. But the hype is real. Inauspicious or not, writer/director Makoto Shinkai's film is somewhat of a genre-bending game changer - a film so special that the struggle to properly do justice to it leaves me resorting to inelegantly cherrypicking from a slew of contemporary allusions (the elegant loneliness of Murakami; the mischievous whimsy of Wong-Kar Wai; an Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind interwoven with The Breakfast Club with the most imperceptible pinch of your average buddy cop comedy comedy for spice), while it is still far more than the sum of their parts. In short, it's one of the most unexpected, simple but profound, entrancing, and poetically beautiful films to cross screens in years. It's as fun as it is melancholy, as unforgettable as it is sweetly unassuming. Even better - it's that rare anime where comparisons to Studio Ghibli aren't simply lip service, but actually warranted in terms of exquisite, painstaking heart and attention to detail. Yes, really. But such lofty praise is actually far from the spirit of a film that goes about its remarkable business with a cheeky subtlety. Shinkai wisely plays off the initial silliness of his concept, with the early body swap sequences staying rooted in lighter, bawdier humour, playfully portrayed with a springy, sassy wit keeping even the broadest moments no less human and adorable for their broadness. The conceit itself is kept indifferently vague, apart from the haziest of nods to traditional spirituality - it's not the 'how' that matters here anywhere near as much as the 'what.' Similarly, there's a clearly delineated dichotomy between the two protagonists' 'tradition vs. modernity' milieus (with larger, extrapolating themes of supplanting history and cultural longing spanning generations to be teased out by those keen enough), but Shinkai is content to let the contrast sit, rather than milking it for shoehorned theme, or garish social commentary. More than anything, the film captures that ethereal but omnipresent sense of vague dissatisfaction, longing, and persistent but directionless striving that is bound to feel almost achingly familiar to any given audience member, regardless of age, nationality, or standing in life. Shinkai takes a distressingly familiar sense of ennui, and infuses it with a melancholy grace, a feeling accentuated hugely by the film's simply gorgeous, sweeping artwork, infusing panoramas of mountain-dwarfed Japanese countrysides and bustling Tokyo skyscrapers with an unbelievable level of composition and care. When the film glissandos into a third-act twist that is as devastating as it is unpredictable for all but the most eagle-eyed of viewers, it transcends into a piece of larger-than-life folklore, conjuring an almost feverishly heightened viewership that redefines magnetic, before culminating with a quiet grace note that ties up the emotional knot in ways both elegiac and unforgettably uplifting. It may sound like a perennial squall of emotional peaks and valleys, but Shinkai surfs it with nonchalant poise, with his rock-steady pacing lending the film an almost uncanny gestalt. Upon the arrival of the closing credits, don't be surprised to hear a wet gasp, equal parts tearful and jubilant, erupting from your throat, unsolicited. You won't be alone in doing so. If there are any imperceptible faults to be found, it's that Shinkai's perhaps inevitable leaning on anime tropes do, at times, dip the film into conventions it would normally nimbly leap over. The occasional conflict-expanding plot device or bombastic musical interlude, particularly in gearing up for the film's climax, strain convention in ways that are only startling in their inconsistency with the film's customary elegance, while lead actors Mone Kamishiraishi and Ryûnosuke Kamiki, while both lending credibly commanding voices, are as hyperbolic as they come in their grunts, gasps, and other verbalizations reacting to their bizarre circumstances. Still, these are the faintest blemishes on the face of a truly beautiful, touching film, that truly demonstrates that the affective potential of traditional animation still has many wrinkles of uncanny power yet to unfurl. So do yourself a favour: believe the hype. Invest in Your Name. If you have any space amidst the ensuing deluge of feelings, you may just thank yourself you did. -9.5/10"
" One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,10,"This film will leave you speechless - it is quite simply one of the most beautifully crafted films I've ever seen. The animation is breathtaking and possibly the most beautiful animation ever put to screen. There really are no words to capture exactly how it makes you feel because this is simply a film that will move you in inexplicable ways. Sit down, enter the world that Makoto Shinkai has presented to us and soak in all of the magic. Un-be-lievable experience!"
" This Movie is a Masterpiece
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,10,"The animation was awesome. The story was deeply moving! I'll always like Makoto Shinkai movies but this is one of his best, phenomenal animaion every frame was beautiful, Makoto Shinkai Should've put so much effort in making this film in every aspect. That what make this film a Masterpiece!"
" Great story
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,8,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Your Name"" (2016) surprised me more then i thought it will do. It has a lot of going on here, with some school student problems at the beginning, body swapping story later and then some more - i won't spoil it. The story here was great, if a bit maybe to complex down the road. Music was beautiful as well as voice acting and animation. Script was very involving. ""Your Name"" is also a very beautiful love story.Overall, the only reason i'm not voting it higher is because i was a bit lost near the end. While the story is great and not one dimensional one, it was a bit to complex for my taste. Yet second viewing would be required. All in all ""Your Name"" (and what a beautiful title) is surely not to be missed one by anyone who loves great stories beautiful told."
" Overrated
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,5,"(NO SPOILERS IN THESE THREE PARAGRAPHS) The sweet love story(?) about a boy and a girl who wished to be someone else, and the wish did come true... but he has to save her first. Or something like that. The only problem is, they don't actually know each other, except by actually BEING each other in what they consider to be only episodic dreams-- I found this concept quite interesting.The art and animation were amazing, a lot was said about this already, and the guy (Makoto Shinkai) is a master in this, so I'll skip most of it; but I specially digged the final landscape scenes with pastel- colored skies and the trippy transportation scene. Amazing. Now for the plot. Maybe I'm reading too much into this, and maybe this movie was purposely made without much care for the actual plot in order to emphasize the amazing animation and crazy sci-fi elements, but I'm gonna give my honest impression:(-----SPOILERS AHEAD-----) I was very disappointed once I watched it and realized that all the hype for ""best animated movie of all times"" was actually very untrue plotwise. It's just a collection of clichés and typical anime-like shoujo (un)romance. Wait, there were also several big plot drivers, all of them unnecessarily mashed together and none of them fully explained: -Body-swap. -Memory loss. -Time travel. -Meteor destroying a whole city. I felt like it was too much to handle for a young love story, and all of that load created a bunch of plot holes and nonsense I couldn't just ignore, e.g.: -How did the characters not notice it was a different year? I don't know about other people, but I hardly ever spend a day without something reminding me what year I'm in. -""Oh, that huuuuuge incident of a freaking meteorite destroying a whole town and killing everyone in it? Yeah, we all in adjacent cities (or the rest of the country, for that matter) just completely forgot everything about it"". -It's not like they could have just exchanged e-mail addresses sooner or anything, just to check if it really happened, right? Seriously, the whole thing would have been solved way sooner. -The father incident? How nice was it solved! He discovered the true value of her daughter and started to care more for her... I think... did he? - And for that respect... Not gonna lie, even if I were a super caring father, I wouldn't believe what this brat is blabbering, mainly because NOBODY ELSE ever noticed. Not even astronomists or w/e are the people in charge of noticing that kind of thing.Then, the characters were pretty normal, anime protagonists. Nothing too annoying or too special about them; that was good, I guess. Typical support characters. I would have liked a bit more love development before he went on to save her, it would have made me care more for his heroic adventure.All in all it wasn't an annoying film. It was a pretty film, it just wasn't a great one. Maybe for younger, more easily awed audiences, this could be the ultimate work of art, but I have seen this plot elements done individually tons of times and dozens of times better executed."
" One high school boy and one high school girl meet in their dream and change themselves with each other in real world.
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,9,"I'm surprised when I watch this film, because I have never seen the story like this. This movie is a little strange. I also can't understand this story perfectly. I think time axis change twice or three times in this movie, so this is a ;ittle complex story, but it makes this story more interesting. After we watch this movie, we can talk about this story we can't understand about.This story uses back music.The back music seems not back music but main music. The music is really good and suits this movie very much. In addition, this movie uses not cut but a song. It's also nice."
" Amazing movie, that's all you need to know
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,10,"The movie shows the story of two teenagers that are complete strangers but they have a very weird connection. There are days that they wake up and suddenly they realize that they've swapped bodies. The movie shows how they learn to live with this strange connection but there's something more to it, something that I won't spoil.I can't decide if the movie is fantasy, romantic, comedy or drama because it has a little bit of every one of those. The movie looks beautiful and is very unique, I haven't seen a movie like it in my entire life. The movie is very funny, I was at the theater (almost full) and everyone was laughing a lot at the parts where the movie wanted us to laugh. And it doesn't have a problem to find a balance between comedy and seriousness throughout all of its run time.The two main characters, Mitsuha and Taki, are just two normal teenagers that go to school and hang out with their friends but you care about them and because of this you feel invested in the story. You can feel a lot of emotions throughout the movie and for me, when a movie does that, is the best thing in the world. Honestly, I couldn't find a single flaw with the movie.This is a movie you can't miss. Even if you are not a fan of anime you can enjoy this movie. I enjoy anime but I almost don't watch it but I really loved this movie."
" A mega-hit anime not produced by the named Studio Ghibli
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,8,"A mega-hit anime not produced by the named Studio Ghibli, the up-and-coming animator Makoto Shinkai's fifth feature-length film, YOUR NAME is Japanese box office champion in 2016, grossed ¥23 billion (circa US$190 million), the fourth largest in the history ever. It starts as a gender-swapping yarn in the present day, Mitsuha, a motherless high school girl from a mountainous region, who lives with her grandma and a younger sister in their family shrine whereas her estranged father is running for the mayor of the town, grouses about her stagnant rural life and dreams of being a boy living in the big city, when a mysterious comet strikes across the firmament, it seems her wish is granted, she wakes up in the body of Taki, a high school boy in Tokyo, and vice versa, the swapping alternates on a daily basis and rebounds to both despite the initial confusion and the side effect of fading memories, Mitsuha becomes popular in the school with Taki takes over her body whilst Miki, the co-worker whom Taki has a crush on, starts to feel closer to him thanks to Mitsuha's feminine intervention. Laden with generic but scintillating humor (Mitsuha's habitual gazing and fondling of her boobs when her body is inhabited by Taki, but ostensibly not the other way around), zippy editing rhythm and hooky J-Pop anthems, the chucklesome paragraph reaches a halt when one day, Taki finds out that the swapping stops, and what follows are his dogged endeavor to looking for Mitsuha's village whose name eludes him with a bolt from the blue waiting down the line. Apparently and inexplicably, their temporalities are not uniform, but separated by three years, and Shinkai's savvy script circumspectly introduces the time-warp into the plot, which evolves into a touching and urgent past-changing undertaking for Mitsuha, facilitated by the numinous power of the traditional mouth-chewed sake and interlaced with a transcendent vis-à-vis in the twilight hour during which the two nearly have time to write down their names. The cataclysm cannot be averted but at least many lives are saved, yet, hampered by the fading memories of each other's names, will they be reunited in the same universe? You bet! Although the ending has a strained elation blatantly turning a blind on the odds of two individuals actually pass by each other randomly in a metropolis like Tokyo. Shinkai's virtuosity of devising picturesque scenery is an extraordinary feat to be reckoned with, a spate of celestial splendor and awe-inspiring landscape are scenery porn to hungry eyes, sometimes spiffed up by flashy juxtapositions of memories and hand-written sketches. Nevertheless, being someone who hasn't been versed in the realm of anime, one might wantonly hazard that the human character is a weak link in the process, their looks are invariably pedestrian and shy of memorable distinctions, perhaps it is an intrinsic defect in the animation where the niceties of facial expressions are still quite a challenge to visualize in technique terms. However, nothing can deny that YOUR NAME is a massive success and an infallible testimony of Shinkai's faculty to carry on the anime torch from royalties like Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata."
" Long distance fantasy relationship becomes great love story!
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,9,"This is a movie that does not look like much at first; nothing fancy or groundbreaking, just the fantasy of a small town girl who wishes to change her life. And then, it just happens: seemingly at random, she shifts bodies with a teenage boy, and a relationship starts. As they get to know each other, the feelings show and something settles, until suddenly, it all stops. No more exchanges, and the boy starts forgetting. All that remains is a nagging feeling that he is looking for somebody, but does not remember her name... This movie is beautiful in its simplicity, and the emotions it brings up. It does not try to explain the why and the how, but rather to make the viewer feels. And it succeeds. While it could be considered slow at times, each moment contributes towards the evolution of the story and the ending. Very much worth a watch!"
" Can you meet me halfway right at the borderline is where I'm gonna wait for you I'll be looking out night and day took my heart to the limit and this is where I stay
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,3,"While I was watching this movie, I kept wondering what in the world I was watching. t was so complex and fast that I couldn't follow it. I just couldn't understand what was going on in this movie. A girl and a boy is constantly switching bodies and I couldn't tell if the girl was herself or if she was the boy in her body.Now, I do not like complex, intense coming-of-age stories like this so I was worried I wouldn't like it but I decided to try it since a lot of people thought it was excellent but I didn't know it would be a coming-of-age story. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but I was still pretty disappointed. It was pretty iffy. It had a fairly interesting story because I like stories that focus on two characters with two different plots and I like the whole switching bodies thing but I just couldn't find myself relating to any of the characters. The characters can be rude and Mitsuha was also cloying. Taki was okay, but not great. I guess he was the only relatively interesting character out of this bunch.The movie had too much crying in it. The only solid thing about this movie was the animation and the voice acting, they were pretty lovely. Most of the music sounded good. But the writing and the directing just wasn't my cup of tea.The end was predictable, the girl and the boy cross paths and they are shown as grown-up. I did not get how they were able to cross paths.I found this movie to be highly overrated and do not get why people praise this movie so highly."
" Very typical and average story with a ripoff ending. Please read before downvoting.
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,5,"This time Makoto didn't even try to go with originality. Pretty art, cliché time travel romance, BGM which you will forget instantly after finishing the movie and characters whose specialty is capturing the characteristics of every Japanese school kid. Cherry on the cake is the lackluster ending which was the perfect way to finish average story with average conclusion. If we talk about the greatest love stories ever told, we look into Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles manga. It had the same time travel love story concept, and one of its 4 simultaneously ending time lines had this exact same ending in the stairs. Except there it was done right and here it is just a cliché. Pretty sure Makoto has read that manga and ripped off this ending from there. I am not very impressed. When it comes to the gender swapping, I have seen better anime series about cross-dressing.Kimi no Na Wa may please some casual anime fans or people who in generally are not connoisseur of entertainment and the art mediums related to TV, literature and games. After over 1000 anime series, 1500 manga series, 2000 movies and 150 games, I can say this is an average movie which tells the same story which has been told times and times again. This is nowhere near the most impressive capturing of the tale, it's just average, but well worth the watch anyway."
" Beautifully animated, well built story
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,8,"Having seen other movies (Garden of Words, 5 centimeters per second and Children Who Chase Lost Voices) from Makoto Shinkai, I've been prepared for the visual masterpiece that is Your Name, but the well built, interesting story was a pleasant surprise.While his other movies were a bit slow or uninteresting for me, this one managed to get pacing and plot right, and was successful in keeping my interest, and managed to build a smart story from the corny body-switch basics.I'm hesitating between 8 and 9 stars, as I've felt the story could have been a bit more complex, and there were some plot holes, that are not so easy to overlook. I'm giving it an 8, but a strong 8...Stop reading, and just go see it already, it's worth it (japanese dub + subtitles)."
" A film is very great!
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,10,"Your Name (Kimi No Na Wa) tells the story of two teenagers with vastly different backgrounds. This may sound like your typical body-swap romantic comedy situation, but you may find yourself on the wrong side of the spectrum as this movie takes you into an incredible journey. With a storytelling so divine, complex, yet understandable, this movie captures the essence of what romantic comedy movies have lost nowadays, a heart and a charm to lure you in."
" Magic in real life
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,10,"The movie started with one simple idea: The feeling that you have when you met someone for the first time. Similar. Warm. Touching. Just like you have known each other for such a long time, and somehow, you was separated. And you know deep in your heart that you are still looking for that one every single day, you will know right away when you met each other. With that simple idea Makoto Shinkai have developed and built a master piece have in the name: Your name. Taki is a city boy. Mitsuha is a country girl. They have different life, not to mention totally opposite. But by a mystic power, they are connected to each other, through space, time. A lot of thing happened for various reasons, and they have forgot each other. But deep inside, they both feel a gap, a hole which cannot be filled. They neither understand nor explain, but they know that they are looking for each other. It might take months, years, lives but they know they will recognize each other immediately... I have to mention again: the movie is such a masterpiece. The story is touching and meaningful. It is magical yet it is familiar with everyone of us. The animation is beautiful. Story telling is good and logical. The music in the movie is something special. It is not just matching and touching, it is also affected the movie itself. If you read the book, you will find out that even before they met, RADWIMPS and Makoto had the same thought about the original idea. A lot of thing in the story had been changed according to the lyrics. If you have enjoyed other movie of Makoto like 5cm per seconds, you will enjoy this movie too. To me, this movie is nothing but one the best two anime of all time, with Spirited Away."
" Mysterious and Touching.
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,10,"Your Name was a very intriguing experience. The film was based around a comet that destroyed a town near Japan's Hida Region, which is very mountainous. Our main character, Mitshua, is a teenage girl who is also the mayor's daughter removed from his custody. Meanwhile, our other main character, Taki, is a teenage boy living in Tokyo who works part- time at a Italian restaurant. However, a comet named Tiamat is approaching Earth and will happen during one of Mitshua's Family's festivals.Your Name was released in Japan last August 2016 and reaching American shores in April 2017. In both countries, the film was universally acclaimed by critics for its splendid animation, story and music. My opinion on the film is that is almost a Ghibli anime. It has the music, feel and animation of Ghibli. But anyway, you should see this film when it comes out on Blu-Ray or DVD."
" This film is simply a masterpiece in storytelling that has everything you want in a romance.
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,9,"Your Name is a Japanese animated film written and directed by Makoto Shinkai, based off his own novel of the same name. I was reluctant to watch this movie at first because besides the works of Studio Ghibli, I am not the biggest fan of anime. However, Your Name was making waves around the internet, with people considering it the best anime movie of all time. I am someone who is naturally gravitated towards hype, and with expectations leveled, and my mind opened, and I went ahead and saw the film. And boy, when the credits rolled, I was stunned, mesmerized and enchanted with just how beautiful this movie was in every way. My relationship with anime does not extend beyond Ghibli films, first few seasons of Pokémon and JRPG cutscenes, the reason being I always feel Japanese animation lacks gravitas and instead replaces it with heavy- handed over-the-top storytelling and voice acting. I was glad to see Your Name not succumbing to any of those tropes, in fact, Your Name being an animated film, was able to make laugh, cry, feel anxious and fulfilled all within 90 minutes, something most live-action movies with real actors cannot even dream of trying. Mitsuha and Taki, our two leads are very charming and funny. The main hook is you hardly see them as themselves, instead they are mostly in each other's bodies. Because of this, we see their characters develop as they literally walk in each other's shoes.The first act to my surprise was candidly funny. I found myself laughing out loud at the fish out of water and situational jokes. There is a running gag where every time Taki would wake up in Mitsuha's body, he would feel her boobs to make sure he is not in his own body, this is when Mitsuha's little sister would burst in the room and see her ""sister"" touching herself. Comedy like this is perfect, because it is within character, situational and not forced.I am going to avoid all spoilers for the second act onwards because I went in the movie knowing very little, and I wish for anyone watching this film to do the same.I will say there is an obstacle in the third act that is suspenseful and tension-filled but not in a Hitchcockian way. Instead, you just want to see the characters succeed and achieve the impossible so much, that when an obstacle stands between them, you cannot help but to be on the edge of your seat. I was rooting for them because I was emotionally invested in Taki and Mitsuha as human beings, and I care about them, and genuinely want a happy ending for them.Having some time to think about the movie after seeing it not too long ago, I felt Your Name connected with me on in intimate level few films have done before. Ever since I was young I was a romanticist, always believing the meeting with the love of my life is bound by some sort of fate and destiny since the beginning of time, and I simply have not found her. The movie explores this subject, what if you are tied to a person by a string? You two through thick and thin, chaos and peace, no matter the time difference, spatial difference, are destined to meet? A story of this kind would have touched my heart regardless of the quality of the actual film, but thankfully, besides having an excellently written script, the movie's supplemental elements like animation and music do not lag behind.The hand-drawn animation in this movie is probably the best I have ever seen. Every frame was perfectly crafted and colors are rich and vibrant. I especially appreciated the little details like water droplets on a spider web during the raining scene and of course, the deliciously animated food throughout. The movie was truly like a painting coming to life and rivals with even some of Ghibli's best. Another thing I need to mention is the music, composed by Japanese rock band, Radwimps. It was simply fantastic, amazing, incredible, heart- warming, heart-wrenching and every adjective that is associated with the word ""nostalgic."" Funny how a piece of music you have only heard for the first time recently can give you the feeling of nostalgia, but that is the power of this film's soundtrack. My favorite piece is Date that plays during Taki's date with his co-worker. The track accompanying the sunset imagery and Tokyo café evokes a poignant, bittersweet sentiment within me, and I absolutely loved it. It makes me think back of times in my life where I was in a similar situation as Taki, and the feelings I had then, the moment, the sunset, the yearning of days gone by.Your Name is a brilliant, heart-felt animated film about two different people's absolute desire to meet one another despite being separated by space and time. Taki and Mitsuha's conviction that leads them to the end of this emotional journey should be viewed by everyone, no matter if they like anime or not. This film is simply a masterpiece in storytelling that has everything you want in a romance. Go see this movie, you will not be disappointed."
" An exceptionally beautiful, truly unique movie.
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,9,"It's difficult to talk about this anime's content without any spoilers so to keep it short:Just watch it. If you are in the mood for a mysterious, philosophical story with some comedy and romance elements that evolves around a very interesting, intelligent and just astonishing story then trust all the other positive voices, read as little about the plot as you can and just give it a go.The only non-spoilery disclaimer I want to give is that the first ten minutes are really ""weird"" and confusing but make perfect sense very quickly so don't get turned off by that.9/10, heart-warming and really unique. Kimi no na wa is surely one of the best animation films in its genre of the last few years."
" Masterpiece of Makoto Shinkai
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,9,"Wow. I think I can say that this is the best animation film I've seen. The story is endearing, the characters too, the film is very beautiful, showing particularly beautiful landscapes and very realistic. The film is interesting showing the difference between a Tokyo boy and a girl living in the countryside, highlighting the difference of sex and in lifestyle but still being very structured, each having its sequences. The film takes on a very interesting dramatic appearance when the boy (Taki) looks for the girl (Mitsuha) and realizes that 3 years separates them as they ""exchange"" at the same time and the film becomes even more interesting, the whole completed by music of great art. So I can only note this film 9, at the limit of the 10, so much beautiful it is. A masterpiece of Mr. Makoto Shinkai!"
" At its heart a love story yet managing to encompass so much more
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,10,"I was not familiar with Makoto Shinkai prior to this film, but having watched it I want to go and explore everything he has ever made. Because this film is easily on par with the best I've ever seen from Japan. The visuals, the characters, the depth of storytelling, the outlandishness of the central idea.The story goes that two Japanese teenagers, one a country girl longing for Tokyo and the other a city boy searching for a direction in life, start to exchange places as they go to sleep. The girl inhabits the boy's body for a day and vice versa. And as they try to solve and understand this mystery, the oddest possible long distance romance starts to bloom.And if that was all, it would be a lovely movie in its own right. The characters of Mitsuha and Taki are both excellently realized. They both act and react to this amazing situation very realistically and are both filled with personality. And it's not romance at first glance. How could it be? They clash, they argue, they mess with each other's lives. But from that fire an understanding starts to emerge and in the end you totally buy that these two would be perfect for one another. One of the best on-screen romances I've ever seen.But the thing is, the movie is so much more than that. It's about the life in the rural Japan versus that in the city. It's about being young and undecided. It's about friendships and those long summers before a major shift in your life. They even throw in a great action mystery towards the end, without it in any way taking away from the central story. Quite the opposite in fact. The mystery actually explains and solves many of the seeming inconsistencies in the story.Plus the visuals, the score, all the technicals. Superb, grand, majestic. Studio Ghibli will always be my favourite for its old time charm and the beauty of its hand-drawn craft, but Shinkai comes as close to that impossible standard as it is possible to come with computers.Though, if I had to nitpick, I would wonder why the film needs a pop song number in the middle of it. But that's the only crack the film has. The only one.Your Name is a wonderful film. It takes numerous strings, plots and characters and seemingly without effort weaves from them a story that is as true and will remain as true as the life it's imitating. Highly recommended for all."
" Missing Anime Days
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,9,"""Treasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up.""Wow, that was actually really good. Even when watching it at 1am in the morning at my Japanese friend's place, it was really exceptional. I hadn't watched anime in a long while, so when she suggested turning this movie on (which I had heard of in advertisements before this cuz of it's endless popularity), I happily accepted, despite the early hours of the morning. When I watched it, I realised that despite having loved anime in the past, I'd never actually watched an anime movie before. But ultimately, it really wasn't too different in style from TV shows. They managed to capture all the traditional anime elements (school life, dates, part-time jobs, festivals, etc.), yet put an original spin on all of it. And, like most anime, it has a completely weird premise and dark plot twists. Funny thing with anime is that I can never really tell how it'll end, cuz so many anime in the past have had the craziest kind of endings. I can never really be sure. I'll always be in doubt until the very last scene.The Japanese-style scenery and animation was spot-on. The soundtrack was really good (as is always with anime). Look, pretty much, this movie's great all round - just give it a watch.Actually, I almost forgot to mention that it's also good on the emotional side of things, so much so that I glimpsed tears in my friend's eyes towards the ending...Pretty much infinite praise for this anime. It really was so good. Lol also, just sort of realised that I miss my anime-watching days so badly."
" Beautifully animated, touching, and funny in all the right places
",2017-06-21 00:00:00,9,"Your Name is an anime film written and directed by Makoto Shinkai (5 Centimeters per Second, Children Who Chase Lost Voices, and The Garden of Words). Based on Shinkai's novel of the same name, this film once again showcases the writer/director's ingenuity for telling a poignant story while also featuring gorgeous art and animation.In the rural Japanese town of Itomori, high school girl Mitsuha dreams of a better life, in particular, that of a young successful Tokyo boy. One day, Mitsuha wakes up in the body of Taki, a high school boy living in Tokyo. Initially treating the experience like a dream, Mitsuha (in Taki's body) lives the life she has always wished for, at least until the day is over. However, Mitsuha soon discovers that she actually can periodically switch bodies with Taki, and that everything she does as him happens in real life but just like with dreams, her memories of these events quickly fade away with time.Beautifully animated, touching, and funny in all the right places, Your Name is another fine entry into acclaimed anime writer/director Makoto Shinkai's expanding filmography. Only somebody Japanese could tell such a carefully intertwining story in such emotional detail. The film is very reminiscent of other body-swapping movies such as Freaky Friday and Face/Off, but with a unique eastern influence untouched by the hands of Hollywood. The Japanese voice acting is great and everybody delivers their lines with just the right amount of feeling without seeming too sentimental or sappy. I have yet to see the English dubbed version, but I plan to do so in the not-too-distant future.I rate it 8.5/10"
" Close to perfection
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,10,"Let me say first that this piece of art is so impressive to me that I doubt that my words would be sufficient to describe how I feel and think about it. Therefore I will try to use an analogy, so bear with me. But beforehand let me quickly mention that the formal and technical sides of this movie are very good - nothing to complain. There should not be any doubt about that. The drawings are beautiful, the animation is fluid, the colors are well chosen, the music is composed and played gorgeous.Now regarding the content: To me personally it is nothing less than a masterpiece; no way around it. It is not merely a movie it is a piece of art like a poem, like a (metaphysical) parable. It is one of the movies that are enjoyable to think about because they are complete, because they are whole - like a an organism. If a regular narrative is a line this movie is a circle. (not circular)The experiential aspect I can only describe by means of an analogy: like the tongue distinguishes a handful of tastes the soul distinguishes a handful of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, surprise and so on. Something could feel sad like something can taste sweet but that does not say anything about the complex quality behind that sweetness. Just because chocolate and bananas are both sweet does not mean they taste the same. Are you following?Likewise not every sad movie is sad in the same way. It does not have always the sadness of the same kind, it can be of a well composed kind of sadness or of a cheap and poor kind. They taste different. So applied to the movie I can say, without exaggeration, that I have never tasted such rich and well-composed emotions, feelings and thoughts in one movie. Such an exotic taste. Partially this move has something of a myth, it gives you a glimpse of the indescribable. In this case, in ""your name"", time and first love plays a role but again: in an exotic way I have never encountered before. In conclusion: Any adjectives like ""beautiful"" or ""brilliant"" would only cause insufficient associations that wont do justice to that artwork. Just like you wouldn't ever be able to feel the taste of an exotic food or fruit by the mere description you got you cannot even conceptualize how this movies ""tastes"". My recommendation is - taste and see that your name is good!"

" This isn't a movie, this is a MV.
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,6,"I'm truly surprised that this movie gets rating so high. In my opinion, it's just normal movie. The plot, the ending is not something new, it has appeared in so manga I have read. Also, the characters don't have any special sides. They two are just normal kids. However, the animation and music is entertaining. (spoilers) 1. I still don't understand how they don't know where or when they live whether they are in the other's body, while They are holding mobile phone all the time to write note and diary for each other. 2. They cope with the change soul things too well, so well that they don't even need call each other to ask for help (whether they meet someone who are old friends, or cousins) or ask about homework or password or anything, not a single time. The only time they call, well, the girl calls the boy to ask about the date he had with another girl which she arranged for him. It turns out the number doesn't exist (not surprise), then we will have to see the whole sad girl scene (not interesting) (no offence) 3. They, literately, chat with each other by note and diary apps on phone, not by message or call like all other human, or like me, at least. =]]] 4. It seems like They don't care about where the other live, don't write down the other's name or the address or any special figure, so that when they connection is cut, the boy forget anything, and doesn't have any way to recall the lost memories (again, I heard many Japanese bring a notebook to note down while they need to remember something. Name and address of the person could use your body isn't something worth noting down so what is worth enough?) 5. Every morning, the girl grandpa watches News, and the boy doesn't realise anything different in the News (I heard that Japanese like watching News, or be forced to watch News) 6. The boy doesn't remember the girl name, or the village's name, but he is good at drawing so he could draw the scenery at the village, and go around ask pp about it, how convenient, right? So why don't you draw the girl too and post on some media society for help. (I know drawing things and pp are difference but it''s a good thing to try. oh, don;t tell me He doesn't remember her face. but he remembers some freaking detailed scenery.)And so on... there are so many things I fell wrong about in this movie. I rate it 6. However, the art and music make me feel like I am watching some MV (long one) but it's cute, it's +1 point. So it's worth 7-."
" Watch this movie. You probably won't regret it.
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,9,"After years of browsing this site, I finally broke down and registered so I can share my opinions with strangers who probably won't care about or even read what I write. But then again, in the past I've used these reviews to help make a decision whether to watch or pass on certain movies. As the best movie I've seen in years, Your Name seemed like the right one to start with. I'm not going to attempt a technical, elitist analysis, as I'd probably just end up sounding like a pretentious moron. I'll just try to hit some key points.As a disclaimer, there's only about 3 directors that I consider myself a fan of, and Makoto Shinkai is one of them. I've seen all his films and enjoyed them to various extents. Your Name is different from all his other movies and, I would say, is his most complete film. The most notable difference is the tone. Whereas most of his works are much more somber, this one has a lighter, comical side that offsets the deeply emotional moments making it more accessible to a wider audience.To be fair, this movie has some flaws. There's a few logical gaps that you just have to ignore for the movie to work. The main characters aren't overly interesting in their own right, and few, if any, of the side characters are developed throughout the film.However, what this movie does well, it does exceptionally well. It is definitely a story-driven piece and the story is deep, interesting, and well-told. I'm not going to mention anything approaching a spoiler. I went in with almost no knowledge of the plot and had a more rewarding experience because of it. I will say, though, that if the first 30 minutes or so seem a bit silly for your taste, stick with it. It gets better.For those wary about getting into anime, this is a good one to test the waters with. It's absolutely nothing like the bits of Pokemon or Dragon Ball Z you may have accidentally glimpsed over the years. I've seen both the Japanese version with subtitles and the English dubbed version. If possible, it's always better to watch a movie in it's original language, but I know not everyone can handle subtitles. The voice acting for the English dubbing is passable. It's not perfect, but it probably won't ruin the experience for you.I tried to be as objective as I could in rating this movie, but there's really no such thing as true objectivity with something so emotionally driven as the film industry. This movie is a personal 10, but I feel that 8.5 stars (rounded up to 9) is an accurate rating. So, anyone reading this who is on the fence about watching this movie, here's one more random person urging you to give it a try."
" Best romantic story of my life
",2017-06-03 00:00:00,10,"I have rated more than 1000 movie on IMDb. So, when I write that this is the best movie I have ever seen and the only movie that I wrote a review about, I mean it. I always had a deep fear that I will never meet my other half, and this movie perfect capture that feeling. There is a pain when you wake from a perfect dream and you realize that you will forget about this perfect world, that was your whole world for that few moments. I am afraid that I will cross the one without even saying hi to her. I will say this is a must watch movie for everyone. Good graphics, excellent story, and you are genuinely happy at the end of the movie."
" Simple Review
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,4,"Only graphic and music in this anime are good. Storyline are good, but Meh. Not many other character had screen time, the story just focuses on Taki, Taki, Taki, Taki, Mitsuha, Mitsuha, Mitsuha. And i feel the romance is very forced. I don't know, but i prefer 5cm/s rather than Kimi No Nawa. It's just my opinion, calm down"
" Well executed tropes, ingenuity and visual porn
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,10,"Who would have know... This gem took a while to cross the oceans into western audiences cinemas, and it was worth every minute! It is a signature Makoto Shinkai piece, the visuals are just beautiful, the dedication to representing modern Tokyo and the Japan country-side is mesmerizing, a work of art which carries intensity and uses all at its disposal to provide a truly cinematic experience, including a great soundtrack! Story wise I can't praise enough the well executed tropes from the genre, and the appropriately quick pacing which respects the audience capacity to follow the flow. Plot wise there's no overly complicated setups (altough some would argue the plot is complicated...), the hooks are fantastically delivered and more than delights the viewer with their conclusions. The main character relationships are always on the forefront, and the secondary characters are well fleshed out, the audience grows to love them.Can't recommend enough Kimi no Na wa doesn't revolutionize, but neither does it have to, it is plain simply excellent. 9.8/10"
" Deeply moving story of teenage love
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,10,"""Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along"" – Rumi.To the surprise of many, Your Name, a Japanese anime directed by Makato Shinkai (Children Who Chase Lost Voices) has become not only the top box-office hit of 2016 in Japan, but the highest-grossing animated feature of all time, surpassing Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away. Its popularity should not be a surprise to anyone who has seen it, however. It is a physically gorgeous and spiritually alive comedy/drama with stunning music by Radwimps and a deeply moving story of teenage love. Oh yes, it also has time travel and sci-fi elements that give the film an enchanting otherworldly feeling even if the plot does get a bit convoluted. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to follow it, but it might help.In any event, the story is the least important part of this highly entertaining and, dare I say, inspiring film. Based on Shinkai's own novel of the same name, the film takes place in a fictional Japanese small town called Itomori where teenager Mitsuha (Mone Kamishiraishi) lives with her grandmother (Estuko Ichihara) and younger sister (Kanon Tani). Her father (Masaki Terasoma), who left religion after the death of his wife, is now the mayor of the city. When Mitsuha complains about small town life and exclaims to whoever is listening, ""Please make me a handsome Tokyo boy in my next life!"" her wish is granted the next day, when she wakes up in the body of Taki (voice of Ryûnosuke Kamiki), a real-life handsome boy who is in high school in Tokyo. Mitsuha must now must adjust to a new life which involves completing Taki's studies and working at an Italian restaurant.Yes, the body switching happens on both ends. Taki is now a teenage girl in Itomori and must struggle to fit into small town life and to accept that he has breasts which he takes pleasure in fondling. The swap lasts for a day, and afterwards, neither party can remember what happened. Body swapping begins to take place on a regular basis, however, and the two (who do not know each other) must learn to adjust to radically different lives than they are accustomed to, with Mitsuha making a somewhat better adjustment. The two learn the meaning of empathy and are now able to help each other by leaving memos on each other's smartphone. Each makes the other's life better in some way, and there's a lingering feeling that they should meet.Back in his own body, Taki travels to Itomori but finds that she died three years ago when a comet hit Itomori and decimated the city, killing one-third of its inhabitants, a reminder of the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake. Now with the help of a magic drink, he travels back three years to help Mitsuha confront her intransigent father and warn the town of the impending disaster. Your Name is grounded in the Sufi concept of Musubi. As told to Mitsuha by her grandmother, ""Musubi is the old way of calling the local guardian God. This world has profound meaning. Tying thread is Musubi. Connecting people is Musubi. The flow of time is Musubi. These are all the God's power.So the braided cords that we make are the God's art and represent the flow of time itself. They converge and take shape. They twist, tangle, sometimes unravel, break, then connect again. Musubi – knotting. That is time."" It is also about impermanence. Like a dream, memories of Taki's and Mitsuha's life in the other's body fade and are quickly forgotten. As Buddhism declares, in this world nothing is fixed and permanent. Existence is a flux and always becoming. What persists, however, are the braided cords that tie one to another and the love that transcends the artificial boundaries of space and time. Shinkai has been compared to the great Miyazaki, but this wondrous film is his and his alone."
" Inspired by forces beyond human understanding
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,10,"I feel like this film was divinely inspired. It is beautiful, yet otherworldly. Without even trying, it hits hidden chords within the human psyche that bring out a torrent of feelings that we never knew we had, or had long forgotten about. When I watched it with my friends, who are normally chatty and sarcastic during movies - they were completely silent, awestruck immersed wholeheartedly. They were quiet, save for a few ""wows!"" at the beauty and detail of the art in this film. When the credits came, they were still so enthralled they just watched the credit roll, without moving or wanting desperately to rush back to their busy lives and schedules. This movie nourished our souls and gave us something we didn't know we needed. We didn't know movies could be this profound, this touching, this meaningful. Think of the most touching and beautiful movie/scene you've ever seen, and loved, and it still doesn't come close to what this film has. Calling it a masterpiece isn't enough. It was more than a masterpiece. 10 as a rating isn't enough, either. There is no number great enough to pay back what this film has given me."
" Your name...?
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,10,"The story being with a girl and a boy. One in the countryside and the other in the city. both are connected through their dreams and they are exchanging bodies and of course a bond is made. Then the story changes its path and you cannot feel but drawn into it without second thoughts.Not only the story is brilliant and really, really, emotional, but the characters are really simple, ones that you can feel yourself identified with no matter how old you are. Then there is the music, which is the cause of your almost dehydration but remember, once in a while is good to clean your eyes. Nothing to say about the animation, as this is an anime, and as an anime is simply perfect. It is good to see some brilliant anime movie that is not from master Miyazaki, because personally, is the best movie from 2016 that I have watched so far. You have romance, you have drama, you have laughs, you have fantasy, you have science fiction the perfect combination all together, which is easy to say but not so easy to make.""Your Name"" is a movie that spell-bounds you since the first minute, or second. It starts like other movies that have played with the connection between two people via dreams, but in this case more than dreams it looks like they are exchanging bodies. Yes, it's not the first time that this concept is approached but still at the beginning of the movie there is something different, a change in the story that you don't see coming because it is too early in the movie for""that"" to happen! And from that moment on you cannot wait to see what is going to happen and before you realize it the movie is over (almost 2 hours of your time well spent!)."

" An experience everyone has been longing for!!
",2017-05-17 00:00:00,10,"This is a film that starts off as a rom-com and later develops into one of the greatest film I've ever seen in my life. Some people might think the plot is complex while some might think otherwise. However, I believe that this film shows how director Makoto Shinkai really trusts his audience in putting the pieces together themselves thus proving how mature this film is, spiritually speaking (u'll get it once u watch it).Besides, the filmmaking technique is masterful and extraordinary. If compared to his (Makoto Shinkai) other films, this is definitely the fastest in terms of pacing. Some viewers might not manage to keep up so there is definitely reasons to re watch this film too many times. LOL. The editing really keeps the audience grounded, yet so free dreaming in the fantastical experience that one does not realize that they have been longing for since a long time ago. This is surely a legendary journey that one should not possibly miss so don't forget to buy it on Blu-ray!Oh, and the animation, FREAKIN GORGEOUS!***MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD***Moving on to to the romantic aspect of this 112-minute long film, the feelings that developed between the main characters are shown quite subtly before reaching the climax. I have to praise how director Makoto Shinkai exploits the body-swapping element by making it happen to characters who are almost impossible to meet thus making the experience of knowing each other much more interesting."
" You wonder HOW the Academy didn't nominate this lovely picture...
",2017-05-16 00:00:00,9,"A few months ago when they announced the Oscar nominations for 2017, I was very surprised to see the French film, ""The Red Turtle"", among the nominees for Best Animated Feature. After all, this strange film featured a plot involving a man who falls in love with a woman who used to be a turtle.and has also earned less than a million dollars at the box office worldwide. At the same time, the Japanese animated film, ""Your Name."", earned over $350,000,000setting box office records throughout Asia for a Japanese animated movie. It has even earned more than any of the films from the terrific Studio Ghibli.home of the legendary Hayao Miyazaki! Fortunately, ""Your Name."" is now playing in select markets throughout the United States and I was in Philadelphia this week.where I jumped at a chance to finally see this record-breaking yet inexplicably snubbed movie. If it's playing near you, I suggest you consider also seeing this lovely and rather adult picture. Now when I say 'rather adult', I do not mean it has any objectionable content. However, parents should understand that just because it is a cartoon does not mean that younger children should see it. They simply could not be expected to follow the plot, as the film is complex and clearly designed for teens and adults. As to the story, for some time it's a tad confusing.and that's okay as it will eventually all come together. It seems that Mitsuha and Taki are somehow psychically linked. When Taki goes to sleep, he finds himself as Mitsuha.which is a bit embarrassing for him since he is a teenage guy and Mitsuha is a teenage girl! But why.why is he experiencing Mitsuha's life? And, the strange part is that he soon learns that what he's experiencing happened several years ago!! And what does a comet have to do with this as well? How can Taki's strange dreams possibly save Mitusha and her small village? I'd say more, but don't want to reveal too much about the story. The quality of this film is very, very nice. I would not say that the animation is quite as good as a typical Ghibli picture, but it is close. But what makes this a delightful film are that it never tries to be cute or formulaic.it's a wholly unique viewing experience. It also is very well written and kept my interesteven though I was suffering jetlag! I saw the film in Japanese with subtitles, though the theater and many others are showing an English dubbed version as well. So, in this case, I actually had the choice which I wanted to seewhich was very unusual."
" The best movie
",2017-05-16 00:00:00,10,"The characters, story,scenery and the BGM are the best. Japan's animations have been tended to commercialize these days. it is rare to have such a beautiful and artistic animation movie. ""your name"" mixes with Japanese culture in its plot and objects. ""Kataware toki(かたわれ時)"" is one of the most impressed plot. this noun is said that it's easier to spot the non-human, like monster or ghost, appear in the nightfall. at the first of the movie, there have mentioned ""kataware toki"" and it shows up in the most crucial part which Taki and Mitsuha finally meet each other. kataware toki has been spread in Japan for a very long time. parents in Japan in the past usually used this folklore to warn the children that they should go home before night.the movie is worth to watch and it is no exaggeration that your name tops the list of 2016 movies."
" A pure visual, auditory, mentally-satisfying, spiritual, magical, spell-binding extravaganza
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,10,"The ""anime"" form has a limited niche of audience may be due to the fact that computer-generated animation appears to be an eye-candy! Well these were my thoughts before I watched this movie (in Japanese). And boy, I was so wrong! I had watched Spirited Away in English a long time back due to its such rave reviews but somehow i felt that I missed something in that movie that others could see and I could not. And that was the end of my 'anime' career. Fast forward 4 years and here I was going through a rough patch of time as I beginning to think that good movies are not being made anymore and that I have watched everything there is to watch and that creativity has limits too! Well you can always be denounced wrong if you have directors like Mr Makoto Shinkai. Hats off to this great director and the music composers Mr Youjirou Noda and the Radwumps band!!! They have produced a masterpiece. A gem of a gem! What sweet romantic love story, a perfect romcoms! Also many praises to the editor of the movie that is again Mr Shinkai... The chemistry between the two lead characters is so strong and intense that you will be spell-bound. First half was a ""feel-good"" part that made me thought is this what the people all raving about? True even in first half, some of the scenes with the background song ZenZenZense were absolutely stunning like the scene with sunrise in the city and sunset in the rural area. Both are shot with absolute precision. Then the second half starts and you ate really caught off-guard. Now you will be really into the story that what is going on and what will happen further! I was on the verge of tears at 3 points in the movie and simultaneously I was pitching for the two protagonists. The comet scene with the song SPARKLE in the background provided a breath-stopping view of the beauty of the scenery. End of the movie was mentally satisfying when you are so much into the characters that any more tragedy might have made me crying my heart out. Now I admit that it took me 3 viewings to fully understand the story due to its complex plot but when you think you have seen every good story in the world then such a refreshing original story is really a big welcome. Now something about the background score and music! When you are watching a foreign language movie and there are no lyrics for the background music and even then you are perfectly in sync with the music, you get to know that the music composers, lyricist and singer have achieved a feat. Music is absolutely lovely. The end score ""Nande mo naiya"" was so ear-candy that I heard it like 15 times before closing this movie off! I immediately bought the Japanese original soundtrack and kept on listening (with English lyrics of course) to it for next 2 days. Only then I got to know that there is an English version of the movie and English version of songs. And now I am writing this review I am listening to the English version of the song ""Sparkle"". I am glad that I watched the movie in Japanese. May be if I would have watched the movie ""Spirited Away"" in its original language then I might have connected it to better. I am looking forward to watching more anime movies and I am really thankful to God that I got to see this movie in this lifetime. I have recommended this movie to more than 100 people till now and still counting. Please give yourself a treat, a peaceful heart-touching rest by watching this movie with your loved one. May be if you are going through a rough patch of time in your relationship then this movie might just be the thing that will rejuvenate your love! Again I can just go on boasting about this movie for eternity but before that watch it yourself and prove me correct. P.S. - The plot of this movie has a bit of resemblance with the Bollywood movie ""Haunted 3D"" which was India's first 3D in-home production, a horror zoner. Indian viewers who liked that movie would feel an instant connection with this movie. This movie is remembered more for its sweet love story and melodious music rather than for acting skills or overall storyline. Watch it at your leisure for the sweet horror love story and songs that you will keep on lipping for years to come."

The art is absolutely beautiful, many times during the movie I was taken aback at how good it looks. the characters' are great. the friends of the main characters are very funny and likable, i wish we would have gotten more time with them. when it comes to the unbelievable premise, the characters reactions mostly stay grounded.a problem with the premise is that there are some small holes here and there. we are also asked to just go with things sometimes, even though there isn't any explanation or logic to it, such as when they forget each others names.*Spoiler Alert*there is one unfortunate big problem with the movie. what seems to be the goal of the movie is for the two main characters to find each other and get together. in one scene the main guy writes 'i love you' on her wrist, but the problem is that they have no chemistry. at no point earlier did I feel that they were in any way romantically interested in each other. this is a big problem because that is the goal. saving the people in the city an impressive act in itself, but it's not enough to make a satisfying ending. aside from this flaw, everything else is excusable.

It's very Japanese, in that both main characters speak in rapid-fire bursts, enunciating their every thought in a dreamy, poetic monologue, which alternately works for it and against it. There's a level of spirituality and self-discovery, too, that's left silent but constantly present, and a message about how important it can be to get in touch with the male and female aspects of our personality. Beautiful on many levels, not the least of which is its raw visual splendor. It's one of the most staggeringly lovely animated films I've ever taken in, stealing my breath with almost every scene; in many cases, I cursed myself for not speaking fluent Japanese because my eyes spent so much time on the subtitles. Both the rustic landscapes of a small, classical Japanese village and the crawling steel chaos of downtown Tokyo are fantastically rendered, sharing both a stunning aesthetic and a sense of warmth and familiarity by the closing scenes. A fresh, wonderful, touching tale with a little something for everyone, I'd dare to rank this with many of Studio Ghibli's finest."
" Amazing animation, touching story
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,8,"Pure Japanese magic. The effort and skill that has been put into this anime is astounding. The story, too, is a beautiful one. Deservingly, ""Your Name"" (Kimi no na wa) (2016) became the fourth highest-grossing film of all time in Japan and the highest-grossing anime film worldwide. It's one of those rare little movie treasures that actually gets the attention and reaches the audience it deserves."
" A Compelling and Captivating Journey
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,9,"I went to see 'Your Name' (Kimi no na wa) at an art house theater and when I did, I was left compelled and in awe of how such a story really grew on me. The thematic material felt remarkably similar to Hayao Miyazaki's way of storytelling that it makes director Makoto Shinkai look like he now follows in the same ranks as the renowned filmmaker (even if Shinkai himself humbly says it's an ""overestimation"" when being compared to Miyazaki).The plot revolves around a teen named Taki and a girl named Mitsuha, who have never met and live in opposite sides of Japan. For some unknown circumstance, they randomly switch bodies back and forth while they sleep and live each other's daily lives. During that time, they learn more about their likes, dislikes, activities, the people they know, and places they go to up until they reach a point of understanding one another on an emotional level that they must meet in person.Shinkai definitely unveiled such a setup with vibrant settings of both Japan's countryside and its traditional customs. Likewise for the overwhelming, yet lively urban city of Tokyo and especially the assortment of likable characters that it had a great balance of both good humor and touching moments. Although the motif of switching bodies has been done numerous times in past films or shows for years, this however provided a deeper sense of atmospheric warmth and compassion occurring between both Taki and Mitsuha. Not to mention the use of the proverbial Red String of Fate used as a metaphor to emphasize their connection. I acknowledge that Shinkai admitted in one interview that he wanted to keep expanding on the movie's mythos and pathos, but couldn't for studio-related reasons. As for me, I felt that perhaps there could've been more done as well (namely on the film's epilogue), but nevertheless it's a movie that flowed seamlessly well with an interesting blend of music done by J-rock band Radwimps that I wasn't left bored in the least.Moral: Trust your heart by running down the uncertain path and see that you'll feel this sense of yearning you never knew you had.I certainly did."
" For a romantic body swap story, Your Name is possibly one of the most beautiful, best anime features ever made
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,10,"What makes love hard to define is the connection that it develops between people. Think about the people that your with everyday. We think about friendship, love, lust, and companionship when your with those friends or lovers. The lines are drawn, but it can be blurred based on the invisible connection that you have with them. Even if you don't see them that day, you still feel their presence in your daily lives, as they feel the same in return. Not only is it metaphysical, but it's also feels like destiny when two lovers can feel that passion when their miles away. I've heard about these kinds of stories done in film and television, but I haven't seen it done in animation. I'm not talking about the countless Disney animated features that have the princess meet her man and their in love in three days; I mean a genuine romance that dives into to relationship and connection that two people have that's hard to explain. I'm thankful that a company like Funimation is willing to release such a film here in America with an English dubbing. So let's see how far a film like Your Name can push this idea. In the small lake/mountain town of Itomori, a teenage girl Mitsuha is board of country life and wishes that she were a boy living in Tokyo. The next morning, she wakes up in an unfamiliar room. She goes along with it, assuming it's a dream, and finds out that the body belongs to Taki, a Tokyo-based teenage boy who is quiet and works as a waiter. When she wakes up the next day, she's back in her body, but finds out that her body swap was not a dream as her friends tell her she was acting weird the other day. It turns out that Taki had her body vice versa. Trough a trust, Mitsuha and Taki make a set a rules on what to do when their body swaps happen. Taki ends up making Mitsuha more popular in school while Mitsuha improves Taki's relationships with his friends and boss at the restaurant. The two start to develop romantic feelings for each other, but after Taki fails to call her, the body swaps stop. Taki then uses his drawings of that mountain town to try and find it to hopefully find Mitsuha.It doesn't seem like much of a story, but I cannot give anymore of Your Name away as the majority of it is how much you don't know. It's a rare movie that not only has two twists, but is also a beautiful story of love. The script understands that true love happens over time, and the voice actors channel a lot of that emotion. Again, without spoiling it, the movie turns into an engaging mystery that made me want to see if the two would end up with each other. I cannot remember the last time I felt that way about a romantic movie.For a movie that didn't really need to be animated, Your Name looks amazing. When I think of good anime, I think of Studio Ghibli. This was produced by an independent studio that may just rival Ghibli. The animation is heavily detailed and uses it's style to it's advantage to tell the story of time-crossed lovers. I wouldn't be surprised if the production had started years ago, as I cannot imagine this being done quickly. I'm sorry that I can't give more information on what kind of story this is, but if you knew, you wouldn't enjoy it as much as I did. Even after it ended, I told myself that I would go see this again which I will.I'll give this ten comets out of ten. Though the summer season hasn't started, Your Name may already be my favorite movie of the year. It may be also one of the greatest anime features I've seen, up on the same levels as Spirited Away and Grave of the Fireflies. It's poetic, Shakespearian, philosophical, beautiful and engaging. I definitely recommend that you see this, in theaters if possible. If the stars can align and more people can see this, we can get more stories like this."
" A memorable work of art.
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"Undeniably one of the greatest anime films I have seen. And certainly up there when it comes to films in general.The extremely rich and developed artwork was visually stimulating and engaging. Intoxicating the viewer immediately at the incredible detail and colors emanated throughout the film.The plot was very touching and quite emotional to see play out. The way this film presents the story and incorporates themes of love, time, and wonder was phenomenal. The way everything weaved together was interesting to watch from beginning to end, and ultimately served for a greatly enjoyable and at times very emotional experience.There were humorous moments, there were sad moments, and other moments of adrenaline and suspense. The main characters themselves were interesting and instantly relatable for me, causing me to identify with and care about them as the story progressed. The way that their relationship with one another develops and the journey they embark as everything unfolds is well-done and quite memorable.There are a few twists and turns, and even though many people would have an idea of how things would play out the film nonetheless does a masterful job of gripping the viewer and making them enjoy every second of it. The twists that occurred were thought-provoking, as was the entire concept and what the film was trying to say in general. This is truly a memorable work of art for me, and one that I heavily recommend not only to anime fans, but film fans in general."
" breathtaking
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"My heart stopped at least 20 times watching this movie. It was so emotional, so interesting, so odd, so beautiful I don't even know if I can find enough words to express how good it really was. The story was absolutely fantastic and the soundtrack fits it perfectly. I'm not the kind that cries during movies but this one had me in tears for like 20 minutes. It's a must!"
" They're no strangers, yet they've never met.
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,8,"Probably the most anticipated anime since the final film of Mr. Miyazaki. Because people know what these guys are capable of. This is one per cent sci-fi and 99 per cent fantasy. The concept is not new for us. From 'Freaky Friday' to 'The Lake House', even the recent American television film 'The Swap', you will remember a handful of names once you read this film's synopsis. Yet the film was so good, because of how well the theme was utilised.We all know the technical brilliance of '5 Centimeters Per Second' and the beautiful romance from 'The Garden of Words'. This is an excellent mix of those two. If love either of them, or both, then you will love it as well. But if you ask me, my favourite is still 'The Garden of Words' from this director. I liked this film, enjoyed thoroughly, so liking it less than that means not a bad flick. Surely a film to recommend for anime fans, as well as for animation's (western audience).The story of two teenagers, one from the rural Japan mountain region and the other one from Tokyo. The plot revolves around a comet that is to pass by very close to the earth. But before that event, the girl is bored with her life, so she dreams of living in a big city and that too as a boy. One day her wish comes true when she wakes up as she swapped bodies, including most of the memories with a boy from Tokyo.For her, it is to live as she wanted and make use of the opportunity. But for him, it is like a curse, hence becomes rebellious. This thing keeps happening frequently for days and weeks. After some times, realising the phenomena is between two, they make a deal and strict order of Dos and Don'ts while away. All this until the day of comet and everything changes forever. Searching for the truth and the result of it leads to the end of the tale.❝Treasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up.❞Unlike Miyazaki, Makot Shinkai's storytelling is quite for the matured audience. It targets adults more than the children. Particularly for not shying away to include naturally occurring events in such situation as the story develops, despite/even though the film revolves around the teens/kids. As for this flick, the concern is not big, but it depends on the nation and its culture you belong to. It is very much acceptable and as the story progress, the best things keep replacing another till the finale. So hooked to it is assured.The film length was good and so the pace of the narration. Well written screenplay, which was based on the book of the same name. But the director admits the inspiration from the previous flicks with similar themes. They have used the real places of the anime version with fictional names, but most of the Tokyo remains same and they all were awesome.In many scenes, the camera panning was a treat. Especially the framerate was high, so no jerks, hence very pleasurable visual experience. Like I mentioned earlier, this is a unique film, despite not a original idea. The film proved the Japan is not overshadowed by Hollywood, particularly after the decline of animes in the recent years. It's up to the quality of the product, if so, then those glory days can be brought back for animes. Anyway, now this film holds the record for highest grossed anime.Apart from technical dominance, the story is also enchanting. If you like romance theme, this will serve you well. A good film for date night. But usually people would skip animation for such occasion and one should not mix up that with anime. Because why I always put apart the anime and animation is, the animes are good at beautiful romance, while its counterpart from the west focus more on comedy and adventure. But the common thing from them is the well explored fantasy theme.Usually the ends are guessable for a film like this and the same case for this in here. Only as a result of the story, you would know what's coming, but not the frame by frame scenes of it. Yeah, I liked this conclusion, the final lines said might bring you tears in your eyes, romantically, if you are an emotional person. One of the best endings, even though it was clichéd. And the credits start to roll up, while you begin to recall everything you just saw in the last 100 minutes. A must see film, so highly recommended by my side. Now I've to wait for another couple of years for such film.8/10"
" Slow, Romantic and nice

You'll feel all sorts of emotions watching this movie. Easily one of my top 5"
" Beautiful, moving, haunting, inspiring
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,10,"This is the first anime film I've ever seen, and I loved it. IMO It's best to see this film without knowing too much about it. Just let the beauty and haunting yearning of the characters sweep you along. The story is so compelling that I had to look up whether the place is real and if the major event in the film actually happened (they are fictional). It's also inspired me to want to learn more about some of the cultural issues and items featured in the story. Highly recommended, even if you're not usually into anime."
" Incredible Anime Film
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,9,"I happened upon this film just last night. I was planning on seeing a different movie, but changed mind when I saw the poster at the movie theater as I am a Japanese anime fan in general. And ""WOW"" is all I can say about this film. Born and grew up in Asia I have no problem with understanding the cultural symbols flashing through much of the film. It would be a cliché of me to describe how beautiful the production is and how vivid the pictures are. What captures me most is the poignant emotional connections between the film characters as well as with audience like me. The film's story line evolves from a devastating catastrophe caused by meteor shower, but out of it emerges compassion, courage and strength. It is more than a sci-fi movie, it is a movie of humanity. I highly recommend it and cannot wait to get a copy of the BR disc as soon as it comes out."
" beautiful but a bit predictable
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,7,"I don't usually write reviews, but I feel like I need to say something about this film, even if the majority of reviews will be overwhelmingly positive. And I'm pretty terrible with these things b/c I don't have a photographic memory.Anyhow, it's a story of boy and girl switching bodies after a cosmic event involving a comet that's never really explained. This happens a few times each week, much to the chagrin of each of our main characters and amusing fun for the supporting cast. I don't want to say much else beyond that without giving away plot details. Needless to say, they start to fall in love with each other as they're living each other's lives.It's a beautiful film. There's one particular sequence in the middle that I absolutely loved visually.The movie started to fall apart towards the last 30-45 minutes once it rushes to resolve a problem introduced in the latter half of the film. It feels like the film needed a bit more running time to avoid this. There's also a bunch of suspension of disbelief required...I mean I guess this is to be expected, but for me, a films starts to lose me once there's too much serendipity involved to resolve everything.Also, I think the film would've gotten better mileage if it had gone down the bittersweet route when rushing to its end.I left the theater liking the film, but it's not like it's the most amazing film I've ever seen (even if it broke the box office record in Japan), nor did it really leave me with tingly happy feelings like after watching some Studio Ghibli films."

" Must watch for both anime and non anime fans.
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,10,"So I just had the pleasure of enjoying ""Your Name"" in the cinema and though I could share some thoughts.(May contain very minor spoilers)I've seen many movies trying to pull off the ""two people mysteriously change body with one another"", but I've never seen a movie doing a good job with it. Until now, that is. Makoto Shinkai's ""Your Name (Kimi no na wa)"" has finally succeeded at the task. With a very well deserved rating of 8.6 and 113th placing on the list of 250 top rated movies of all time, ""Your Name"" delivers us anything we could ask from it:A terrific artwork, the movie's animation is extremely well made, with beautiful landscape scenes accompanied with an excellent soundtrack; the sky, sun, water and comets are completely astonishing and mesmerizing to watch. There is even a psychedelic like animation scene halfway through the movie during a critical moment that is deeply touching. Just like in every of Mokoto's movies, the characters are extremely well constructed and it makes you fall in love with them after 10 minutes into the movie, developing a huge emotional bound to the story. The movie had a perfect balance of everything: comedy (which isn't always present on Makoto Shinkai movies, so it was quite pleasant to see it in this one) drama, romance, some mystery, all with a touch of non-linear movie structure. It's the type of movie that will make you laugh, cry, laugh while crying The movie's perspective constantly changes between the two main characters, what gave it a very touch and it's not something you see very often.For every anime fan this movie is definitely a must watch, and even for non anime fans I'do recommend to give it a try!"

In fact someone behind us started snoring and someone else snorted loud when they started to fall asleep, it was that bad.

" ""Your Name"" is a sweet, engaging and beautiful, but confusing and somewhat loopy movie.
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,7,"Sit back, relax and let me tell you what I think of Your Name. No, not your name (that would be way too personal) I'm talking about the Japanese anime fantasy feature film ""Your Name"" (PG, 1:46). Now, if you're not familiar with Your Name, you should be. In the first place, who doesn't know their own name? (Okay, enough bad puns.) The MOVIE ""Your Name"" opened in U.S. theaters on April 7, 2017, a little over seven months after its release in Japan. Before it even reached the U.S., the film had become the fourth biggest film ever at the Japanese box office, their top-grossing film of 2016 AND the #1 anime worldwide to date! Based on the 2016 novel of the same name by Makota Shinkai (who also wrote and directed the screen adaptation), there is much to distinguish this film from previous anime features.The film's roots are a combination of the traditional and the contemporary, as it forged a fresh path both in Japan and beyond. This is the first anime not directed by Hayao Miyazaki to make over $100 million (about 10 billion Yen) in Japan. ""Your Name"" also became the highest-grossing Japanese release in China and was the first Japanese film in a dozen years to attain the top box office spot in South Korea. Not bad, for a film that is singularly Japanese. One of the reasons given for the film's success is the soundtrack, which includes songs from Yojiro Noda, lead singer for the Japanese rock band Radwimps. Critics and audiences have also praised the film's animation, as well as the plot and its emotional impact. According to Wikipedia, ""Inspiration for the story came from works including Shūzō Oshimi's 'Inside Mari', 'Ranma ½', the Heian period novel 'Torikaebaya Monogatari', and Greg Egan's short story 'The Safe-Deposit Box'."" The film's main location, a town called Itomori, is fictional, but the buildings and landscape are based on Japan's Gifu Prefecture. Itomori is where the central character in this story lives.Mitsuha Miyamizu (voiced by Mone Kamishiraishi in the Japanese version and by Stephanie Sheh in the dubbed English-language version) is a high school student who wants more out of life than what her tiny hometown has to offer. She's not very self-confident, she doesn't have many friends, she cares little for tradition and is even less enthusiastic about being the daughter of the town's mayor. While her tough, traditionalist widowed father is busy mayoring, Mitsuha and her young sister are being raised by her traditional, but kind grandmother. All of Mitsuha's frustrations boil over one day when she shouts into the sky that, instead of a meek country girl, she wishes she were a handsome boy living in Tokyo.Then it happened – Mitsuha wakes up one morning to discover she has mysteriously switched bodies with just such a young man named Taki Tachibana (Ryunosuke Kamiki / Michael Sinterniklaas). Both high schoolers are understandably disoriented and upset by finding themselves in the body of someone of the other gender, in a house with a family and going to a strange school in a different place and with friends whom they don't know. Mitsuha and Taki each believe they're dreaming, so they just get by as well as they can and wait to wake up. When they do each wake up the next morning, back in their own beds, they're relieved until their family and friends comment on how strange they've been acting.These body swaps continue happening, about every other day, but the memories of what Mitsuha and Taki each do in the other's body quickly fade, much like a dream. To keep track of what's going on, the two teens start leaving each other notes, first in paper notebooks, and then on their smartphones – and they start intervening in each other's lives. Mitsuha, as Taki, helps Taki start a romantic relationship with his supervisor at the restaurant where he works part-time, and Taki, as Mitsuha, helps her become more popular. When their body swaps suddenly and inexplicably stop, Taki tries to make contact with Mitsuha in real time, but cannot reach her by cell phone. He takes a train to her district, armed with sketchy and fading memories from his days as Mitsuha, and learns something which affects him profoundly and causes both he and Mitsuha to embark on separate, but parallel and highly significant tasks.""Your Name"" is a sweet, engaging and beautiful, but confusing and somewhat loopy movie. The animation features especially vibrant colors and it is creative and skilled, often giving the impression of depth, even as a 2-D production. The movie also provides an interesting window into the world of modern Japan, through the juxtaposition of urban and rural environments. The main characters and supporting players are likable and fun to watch, but sometimes act illogically. More problematic, however, are dealing with the movie's plot holes and keeping track of who is who, when, and what is happening during some of the body swaps. But all of that aside, ""Your Name"" features an interesting story, which includes elements of humor, excitement and even suspense and charms its audience. It combines influences from many sources, but still feels fresh, creative and vital. This film is ""Freaky Friday"" meets ""The Lake House"", with the look of an updated ""Spirited Away"", and it's visually and emotionally pleasing in spite of its shortcomings. ""B+"""
" What Begins as a Cute Movie Evolves into Something Much More
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,10,"Your Name. follows a boy and girl who randomly begin to switch bodies, and how their relationship develops through that. There's a lot more to this movie than I can say, because around the halfway point everything changes and it becomes much more than a simple feel good movie. And that's what it is for the first third. It's quirky, fun, cute, all that. It's not great, but it's really enjoyable.The second that aspect of the movie ends the movie begins its quick ascent to one of the best movies I've ever seen. It builds the characters and their relationship well and by this time we're already attached to them well enough, but then something happens. There's a huge plot twist in this movie that, put simply, blew my mind. And moreover, made me tear up a little. From there on it just gets better and better, writing-wise. The movie doesn't just have a great story though. For starters, the animation is beautiful. And it isn't just pretty paintings and scenery (though there are), the imagery is also unique in some scenes, where what is being shown isn't completely natural but it looks cool anyway. At the same time, it isn't just mindless artsy- fartsy crap, it actually has relevance and symbolism and stuff. The movie's soundtrack proves to be quite good too. A song plays every once in a while, and all of them are well-suited to the movie and just sound nice. I don't think I'd listen to them outside of the movie, but I like them nonetheless.Something that really stood out to me was how realistic it could be. Sure, it feeds off of plenty of things that would only happen in an anime world, but it doesn't rely on those. The characters act in realistic ways and say things you'd expect them to say, all without removing the anime charm entirely. I always think it's cool to see a movie with a few confusing scenes, then see everything come together at the end, making all those scenes make sense. Your Name. has plenty of those. There are scenes that you kind of just forget about but then they come up again later and you realize that this was all thought out well before the movie was made, and it really shows just how much effort was put into the movie in the first place. It's clear that it's trying to be something more. It's trying to be complex, and it actually is. The movie isn't too terribly hard to understand, but it does require you to think at least a little to fully get it. Overall Your Name. is an anime that excels in every aspect of it. The writing is fantastic, the characters are fun and lovable yet realistic, the soundtrack is well-suited, it's beautiful to look at, and it makes you think just enough that it isn't overly confusing, but enough to still make it complex. In the end this isn't just one of the best anime films, this is one of the best films I've ever seen, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to just about anyone."
" Your Nuts!
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,1,"8.6 IMDb rating? All those cryptic glowing reviews? I was very suspicious, but we go to the movies once a week and saw everything else currently running so we gave in, bought our ticket and popcorn ($29.50) and hoped for some worthy movie entertainment. What we got was a really GOOFY story based on a fantasy premise which makes you wonder what the hell is going on - and involves a comet. You'll more or less figure it out by the end, but the annoying tedium of it all isn't worth the time or money. It will appeal to the anime cult, and those self-proclaimed esoteric types who enjoy claiming symbolic meaning in meaningless things.I use IMDb as a screening tool for selecting movies to invest my valuable time and money in, but all the ridiculous hype on this one clearly failed me. It's not the first time, and I increasingly find that perusing the ""Hated It"" reviews is more useful in making a decision on what to see."
" Donnie Darko w/Boatloads of Sweetness Instead of Angst
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,10,"Oh, and gorgeously animated.I think that's a fair way to sum up this movie. It starts out as a fantasy and, as it reveals more puzzle pieces, you realize it's more science fiction. There are tightly plotted reasons for everything that's going on, all of which are revealed in good time.Like like all good puzzle movies, there's a thrill every time something is revealed that ties things together. It's complex enough that you want to see it again immediately, but no so complex that you have any doubt as to what basically happened.Like Donnie Darko, while it's busy scrambling your head and keeping you guessing, it is somehow managing to be deep, both emotionally and thematically (the latter drawing on Japanese culture and religion). Unlike Donnie Darko, it's never dark and disturbing in a creepy way, although there is plenty of danger and peril. Instead, it radiates sweetness and love, without ever becoming saccharine.Donnie Darko is one of my two or three favorite films of all time, so this is high praise. Of all the films I've seen since, nothing has come closer to matching its combination of thrilling revelations, emotional resonance, and thematic depth than Your Name."

",2017-04-09 00:00:00,10,"I didn't find this as elegant or refined as Miyazaki's best work, but I thought it was much more emotionally powerful. Seeing it with a good audience helps: I was moved when someone in the theater audibly gasped and involuntarily wailed ""No!"" at one point in the movie. She spoke for all of us, because we were all bound up as one in that moment. That's a great movie."
" An enjoyable watch if you like animations
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,7,"I'm not too familiar with Japanese anime movies, but this movie was very enjoyable. It honestly grew on me, after having had some time to think about the movie. The movie has a well thought-out plot, with good characters that are easy to empathise with. Some of the scenes were beautifully animated, adding 3D elements, with big differences and foreground and background focus, making it often feel as though you are watching a normal film, instead of an animation. I did however feel that the female character's voice was a bit whiny at times, and it made me think I was watching a baby toddler having a tantrum instead of a teenager, but this may be more to Japanese taste than mine. Overall an enjoyable watch, would recommend it if you are into animations."
" Words can't describe how fantastic it is.
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,10,"Your Name, also known as Kimi no na wa, is an anime film is directed by Makoto Shinkai and it is based on the book written by Shinkai. It tells the story of a boy named Taki, a high school boy who lives in Tokyo who out of some bizarre miracle, begins switching bodies repeatedly with a high school girl named Mitsuha who lives out in the country. The two learn about one another through various hi- jinks and need to find a way to pair up and stop something from happening.The movie was English dubbed by Funimation and came to select theaters in North America for a week and I have been dying to see this after hearing about all the buzz regarding it, and I'm not going to lie, this was one of my most anticipated films of the year. So, how did I feel about the movie after seeing it? If you couldn't guess by the rating, I loved it!The movie was incredibly engaging and I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The story is simply immersive, with many surprising twists and turns along the way that can really bring you into the experience. The mystery of the movie is an element that really drew me in, and it lead to me thinking of some questions that eventually got answered as the movie pressed on. The movie is very emotional with many scenes that will send you The interaction between our two leads Taki and Mitsuha is definitely strange to say the least, but in a good way, even if their interactions are awkward. I'm just going to leave the explanation regarding the story and characters off right here because it's hard for me not to review this particular film without talking about the film in-depth.The animation is fantastic to look at as well. The designs for the back grounds in particular really gave me a feel for what the city in the country looks like as well as what Tokyo looks like. The CGI does a surprisingly good job at blending in with the traditional animation. Even the movements of the characters look natural, as well as the environments. Even though the art style is no new anime art style, it still is a very well polished one. During one scene, the art style goes through a major change that would last for a few minutes and personally I loved the change. I loved the vocal songs that were featured in the movie. As someone who isn't a fan of modern music, I found them quite refreshing, even if they are just English dubbed.Your Name is simply a fantastic movie experience regardless of whether you're an anime fan or not. It's really easy to see why it gained critical acclaim in Japan and multiple awards. The story is incredibly gripping and our two lead characters are both very interesting and very likable. The animation is beautiful from start to finish and the vocal songs felt refreshing. I'll be honest, it was very hard to find a legitimate flaw with the movie. However, if I do have one legitimate criticism towards the film, it's that the film starts off pretty slowly and is not as engaging as it is later on. However, I can afford to forget about that since it didn't bother me that much. While it's in theaters for a limited amount of time, go see it. This film has to be seen to be believed.If I could make a recommendation however, I do think the movie is more suitable to older audiences in spite of the PG rating. I wouldn't recommend the movie to those under the age of 10 due to some suggestive themes that might not be appropriate for audiences under that age. If you do plan to bring kids under the age limit, make sure to keep an eye out for them."
" Immature, cringy and boring
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,3,"Let me start by stating that this film contains the most beautiful animation ever seen in a Japanese cartoon, hence the 3/10 score.That being said, cinematography can only account for so much in a movie. In this case, the rest is simply a train wreck.The movie is aimed at children aged 8-16 at most. The dialogue is a cringe-fest, characters are unbelievable and the story is boring. There is no suspense, no anticipation and no character development. The typical anime character are present here and everyone is expendable to the story, which is a mess. The intrigue is without substance and won't entice a shred of interest on behalf of the viewer. This is a rare instance where my biggest anticipation was for it to be all over. If you've seen ""Only God Forgives"", expect the same kind of filmmaking: all the efforts went into the visual side of the movie. The rest is horrible. It needs a special level of immaturity to be enjoyed. Adults cannot be entertained by this.The definition of over-hyped."
" Ranks among the best animation has to offer.
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,10,"""Your Name"" took a while to get an American release but so anticipation for this film has been rising. Especially since so many say its great!The story centers on two main characters living in Japan whose lives are closely connected. Taki and Mitsuha are both teenage students who wake up in each other's bodies and begin to grow as characters and in their appreciation for each other by living their lives. By far the most astounding aspect of this film is its story and beautifully constructed narrative. The story structure manages to keep its audience on the tip of their toes to focus while never losing itself in convolution. Makoto Shinkai has managed to craft a beautiful story that both touches the heart and makes you laugh out loud (considerably hard at some parts). This blend of drama and comedy make this piece both deeply and emotionally resonating, as well as undeniably enjoyable. The animation itself is a thing of beauty. If anyone has seen the trailer, they know this movie offers beautiful and captivating animation from the very first shot. Hopefully, this film will gain traction in the U.S. considering it truly is one of the most breathtaking film experiences I've ever been a part of. It's become a personal favorite and is definitely the kind of movie that should be praised and seen by as many have the opportunity. Definitely give this a good watch and bring kids to see it too (maybe a bit older kids)!"
" Your Name Please!
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,10,"Your Name is a lively combination of romance, identity, and culture. I went into the film with a very little understanding of the plot's complexities. From the trailer, I assumed Your Name would be an anime Freaky Friday love story. The framework of the narrative certainly fits into my initial assumption. Yet, there is a multitude of undercurrents in the film which make Your Name stand out. For starters, Your Name constantly changes themes and mood. Often, I found myself laughing and, a few minutes later, would suddenly be on the verge of tears. The movie's eclectic flow makes for a constantly engaging experience. The Freaky Friday element is roughly half of the film's two-hour runtime. In fact, a plot twist in the film literally took my breath away. Your Name is the rare film which combines overwhelming variety and makes everything fit organically. Through variety, the anime earns a conventional ending between protagonists, Mitsuha and Taki. While body switching is the plot's main intrigue, the film adds complexity through its exploration of Japanese culture. Japanese gender identity is explored with such a masterful hand. In subtle strokes, the viewer understands the sheer contrast in the lives of Japanese men and women. For example, a group of men have a crush on a female co-worker; Mitsuha, in Taki's body, simply initiates conversation with the desired woman and, with ease, sets up a date. When Taki is back to normal the next day, his male coworkers all line up disgusted by his act of group betrayal. The scene effectively demonstrates the strength of the herd like quality of gender in Japan. It's no surprise then when Taki, in Mitsuha's body, finds such humorous wonder in the breasts he suddenly gains. A contrast can also be noticed in the struggle between the past and present. The present is Taki's experience of Tokyo. Likewise, the past is illustrated by Mitsuha's familial duty to her small town's local shrine. In other words, the film merges Japanese spirituality with modern sensibilities. A desire to escape and return to the country define the film's ecliptic take on Japan. Mitsusha is your typical country girl with a thirst for a life in the city. Meanwhile, Taki finds beauty in Mitsuha's country town. The viewer amusingly experiences each setting (Tokyo and Itomori) through the unique lens of the protagonists. Ultimately, a comet and local god guide the distant figures into a surprising collision course. As a result, fate is sealed by the two somewhat metaphysically dissimilar sources. The forces of science and divinity augment Your Name into making the seemingly fated connection all the more plausible. The film is a testament of the ""opposites attract"" sentiment. In summary, the film has a real beating heart. I will end my review saying Your Name is the best looking animated film I have ever seen. The colors are always pleasingly vibrant. Additionally, all of the scenes are lovingly rendered and pulsating with life. I haven't walked out of a theatre with such a positive perspective on life in a long time. If you live in a city, you ought to take the time to experience this anime masterpiece."
" A coming of age master piece
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,10,"Had Already watched the Japanese version and now watched the English dub version (which had average voice acting/. Still can't get over how amazing this movie is. I was under a lot of depression when I went to watch it , knowing very little about what was at offer. And boy was I entertained! Since then, I've bought the soundtrack album in Japanese, read the novel on which the movie is made and amongst all this , my depression has cured. It's unbelievable! There's nothing wrong with the movie at all! The rating ⁉ 11/10 for me! :P PS those who still don't trust all the positive user reviews should just realize that the metascore is 78! It's not easy at all to get that high number. The bottom line being that it's a roller coaster ride of emotions that is bound to make a long lasting impact upon you. Highly recommend watching it in Japanese as that's how the director wants us to see it."
" Great Animations
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,8,"The animation in this movie was absolutely amazing ! Even though people may discount the movie since it's animated but I really recommended everyone to watch. Some parts were humorous, other parts mysterious but the connection that forms is so beautiful and unreal. You really end up embarking on the journey with the characters to discover these beautiful scenery and unravelling truths, it's astounding!"

" Beautiful film**Objective review**
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,9,"Breathtakingly beautiful film with amazing animation, story line and music..however I have one complaint and trust me when I say I've seen many films..I had bought over a 1000 DVDs and gone to cinema for many films and I've watched a crazy amount of films/series and anime on TV and online so I really do have big experience with films and I do write short novels myself so let me explain it as simple as I can,The problem with this film is that the author tried to play with time but failed at it..had he found another way around it would've been perfect so here's the problem:1)During their body swaps it was clearly stated that they were the same age. 2)Being the same age but her dying 3 years before he started switching bodies with her means that there was a time thing where the past her swapped bodies with the present him. 3)At some point she decided to go see him but he didn't know who she were because it was in the past before he started seeing his dreams however she gone to see him and he was the same age in the past when he should've been 3 years younger as he confirmed he kept her hair tie for 3 years and being so young a 3 years difference he should've looked younger. 4)The way she stayed alive is that they changed the past for her to live but at that time when she didn't die she would be around 16 years old I believe which means she never died and by the time Taki started having his dreams, 3 years in her world would've passed already which makes her 3 years older than him in the actual time meaning that when he finally found her at the end she should be older than him which I doubt it was thought of.That is all and other than that the film was amazing and I've watched it few times and I still love it!"
" Just gorgeous, every single human being deserve this amazing movie in their lives :D
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,10,"Holy molly just beautiful, how can I describe what do I feel when I saw this movie? speechless and at the same time I want to shout to everyone that life is just gorgeous, how can I express myself? this is the kind of thing that you need to live with your own flesh, spectacular, astonishing,incredible 10/10."
" Really touched
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,10,"And did not imagine so touched, and even a little burn brain. Finally meet again and say ""what's your name?"" When I was almost out of tears. Can you tell me why I can't remember the name of the other person for no reason? Even if the Japanese invaded China, we will be more or less hate the country, but the technology and the story, we have to make good movies without borders, we still accept this fact!"
" One of the best few movies that I love
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,10,"I really don't bother writing a review for a movie or even a book except to this one. My emotions were very satisfied with this movie. I laughed, I cried, I got excited, I even got scared. Haha! Every part of me shivered in this movie. The OST is very beautiful! one thing I hate about seeing this movie is that, I have now high expectations and standards for other movies."
" Best Film, Animated and Not, I have seen in years.
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,10,"Disclaimer: This review is spoiler free and for the lazy reader, I will give ratings based on main categories: Story:9Art:10 Sound:10Character:9 Enjoyment:10 Overall:10.Now that we have gotten that out of the way, I want to give my personal opinion on the film, with a rather unconventional review:What is beauty? Is it the sound of the sea during a storm? Is it the sound of grasshoppers on a humid summer's day? Is it determined by any one single dominant element, or the fusion of several threads that come together, interconnecting, to form a myriad of colors in a tapestry?What is a masterpiece? Is it a magnum opus? Is it something that fills us with pathos, until we are at the brink of tears, be they of joy or of sadness? But more importantly, I ask you, reading this, how do you decide what constitutes a masterpiece and what doesn't?Makoto Shinkai's latest work, Kimi No Na Wa, is all that and more. Setting the bar very high for following works, it sits comfortably among the greats in animation, if not filmmaking in general. He (Shinkai) has earned his place among the great directors of our time, and western animation could learn a lot about storytelling by example. I recently went to see this expecting to see your average slice of life/romance anime, and had my doubts, figuring it would have had all the usual clichès, boy meets girl, falls in love, etc etc at least, that is what the trailers would lead you to believe. But this film is anything but average, moreso I wouldn't even call it a film, but an almost two hour experience. A delight for all the senses it satisfies from the beginning to the end and it has a completeness to it that few other films may boast, not only among anime but among films in general.That being said, this film is not perfect. In fact it very well may have several imperfections, mainly characters and storytelling (though it was a completely new topos for me); imperfections which more likely than not have been discussed at length by other people. All I can suggest to the reader, is to see it and decide for themselves. Anything else would do you, the reader, and the film quite an injustice.Art, being human, is, by definition, imperfect in itself. But does that make the emotions that it evokes in us any more or less valid? A painting may have corrections, and a book may have errors. Are those works of art any more or less masterpieces just because they aren't perfect?The truth is, nothing is perfect, nor will it ever be, not while created by imperfect beings. But why does that matter? Why strive for objective perfection, when we perceive imperfect things to be perfect?It isn't a perfect film, but it is, possibly more importantly, a perfect experience.What really else matters?"
" A beautiful piece of art, but the quality of the story is held back by Makoto Shinkai's ability to take that extra step,
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,7,"I think most of us can safely say that as far as pure direction and art go, Makoto Shinkai's popular new movie called ""Your Name"" has taken the world by storm. As of now, it has won several large prizes and it's praised by casual watchers and critics alike.There is no doubt that this is in fact one of Makoto Shinkai's most beautiful pieces of art as far as pure visual fidelity goes. That, in combination with its engrossing soundtrack just allows the movie to speak to the heart directly. This often means that people will refrain from criticising this movie, and i find myself being a lone bird flying in the opposite direction of all the others when it comes to this movie.The issue i have with this movie doesn't lie in its art, or in its direction. It more lies within the lack of depth in the story itself. Makoto Shinkai is known for using repetitive settings in his movies, as they do tend to sell well.I just wish Makoto Shinkai would have been a bit more creative in his writing, rather than making me think ""oh, it's this again. Not very original."" The story is confusing, but once i figured it out it didn't leave me lost in thought and i was honestly disappointed. That being said, Your Name is still a solid movie with stunning animation and I'd recommend you try watching it yourself. It's not very long and it's definitely worth a watch purely because it looks stunning."
" Love Story - Romance + Clichés
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,4,"THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THE STORY. EVERYTHING ELSE (ART, SECONDARY CHARACTERS, ATMOSPHERE) IS GREAT.A boy and a girl discover that some days, their lives are swapped, which they only remember as dreams afterwards.You see the love story coming between those two ? Color me naive, but I didn't.First, it's one of the most contrived premises you could have for a love story. Second, there's like a million stories you could tell with such a premise, why take the less original ? Of all the funny, awkward, insightful etc. things that could happen to two people who exchange lives, why go for the most clichéd ?But OK, let's accept that they fall in love with each other. After all, a lot of the emotional impact of the second half of the movie hinges on their being infatuated with each other. But we're never shown that happen ! The most we're shown for Mitsuha (the girl) is that she takes an interest in Taki's (the boy) life. I guess it could count as both reason and show of her growing fondness for him. As limited as it is, at least it's a small hint that something's happening.We're not so lucky with Taki.After his date with his female coworker, she guesses that he's recently fallen for another woman. At that point I thought she guessed wrong, because nothing we see supports that idea. But I'm more and more convinced that she's conveying the message of the authors : at that moment, they're flatly informing us that Taki is falling for Mitsuha.What do they say again in storytelling school ? ""Show, don't tell."" Well, it's a typical example of telling, not showing.It's like the movie is trolling us : ""Oh, btw, Taki's totally into Mitsuha now ! A lot of stuff happened, but we didn't think it was worth showing, even though ALL we're showing you are those 2 very characters. U mad ?""Just to be clear, I'm not saying that he has no reason for falling in love. He has plenty ! If you've seen the movie, here's a quick quiz. Taki falls in love with Mitsuha because :a) he's attracted by her looksb) he's impressed by her skillsc) he's thankful for her helpd) he remembers their first encounter in the subwaye) they're soulmatesf) any of the other bazillion possible reasons ?You don't know ? Nobody does ! Because we don't see their love bloom.As it is, this love story misses its core, its pivotal moment. It's a love story without romance.Little annoyances :Memories and messages appear and disappear so as to fit the plot's needs so perfectly that we have left the lands of Plot Convenience to enter the realm of Plot Laziness.The second part is so clichéd that at any point you can safely guess what happens in the next 15 minutes.Mitsuha convinces her father at the end in a deeply moving and insightful argument. Well, I guess, because we're TOLD, NOT SHOWN (uuuuugh)"
" Breathtaking
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,10,"If I had to explain how this movie made me feel in a few words, it would be: breathtaking, making my throat hurt. Really touching and will probably make you value the people you love.Drawing is amazing, animation is really good, this movie is worth winning an Oscar, but who cares about awards, this story doesn't need any of those to make it any better."
" A movie you must watch
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,10,"There are only a limited number of animation movies that make every frame look like an artisan masterpiece of drawing. I have watched Makoto Shinkai's previous movies. They were very beautiful too, but the stories were a bit slow and boring. Your Name started with a typical sci-fi settings. Yes, you have heard about this kind of stories many many times. But wait for the story-line emerges you for the exact feeling of the main character. I feel like a lot more stories can be told but Shinkai tried hard to give a shorter version. I hope more deleted scenes will be available in the BlueRay version.Quality: Extremely high. Story: Very good; makes you think about it afterwards. Music: I enjoyed it."
" Magical
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,9,"When the movie started, I was a bit disoriented, as the first few scenes had fast cuts, and I hadn't been grounded yet. There is a lot of time travel and this does get confusing throughout the film, but I wasn't very bothered by it. I'd say that the constant time shifts actually add to the mystery of the story, as you're always trying to figure out where in the timeline you've jumped to. The animation is great, with vivid colors and great lighting effects. I can't imagine how difficult and time consuming it is to make graphics look realistic. I just enjoy the finished product. Very detailed work. I think there is more of a 3D depth to anime than there is with cartoons. Just something about their technique gives it so much more aesthetics. Or perhaps it is also the vast range of colors that are used. The story keeps you guessing as it progresses, and that's what makes it so magical. Anything can happen next, and you don't see it coming. I was thoroughly invested with the story and found the script to be both comedic and culturally aware. The two main characters are quite different from each other, but both are headstrong and their stubbornness is fun to watch. Overall, this is a great fantastical film to watch, for both the old and the young."
" Masterpiece
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely breathtaking movie. It's a roller-coaster of emotions, with a great story told by magnificent animations.It manages to embroider fantasy and romance extremely well.The soundtrack really adds to the overall impression, it's a fantastic choice. For me it's the best film I've ever seen."
" Beautiful film.
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,10,"I personally loved this film, though I admit I may need to watch it a second time to fully grasp everything I saw. The story is just so mind-boggling! You may end up recognizing some familiar concepts, but they are presented in a way that is not too ""cliche"" and without shoving romance in your face the entire time. Overall, Your Name is an unforgettable experience. It left me totally mystified. 10/10"
" I think this is overrated.
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,5,"I have watched a lot of Anime films, and have heard recently that Your Name is very popular, an amazing film, heartfelt, top seller, etc. However, I feel Most Ghibli films and other anime films such as Wolf Children to be much better (sorry for the comparison). But, me watching so many of these kinds of films and reading a lot of manga similar to it; seemed very cliché.It didn't really felt like the plot had a message to convey, though I did really enjoy the plot. I personally love the swap body plot-line in manga. But I feel, it is not really original and some aspects over-used. I felt a strong resemblance to 5mm per second. What mainly spoilt the film for me was the singing. It was the same song and was used around 4 times over the course of the whole film. This got annoying and I went straight to turning the film off as soon as it went on credits. Which I don't do in other films I really enjoy. Though it is personal preference on the song used, I think it's a bit too much to use the same song 4 times in a film. Actually, I don't see any need to use it more than once!I also didn't feel any heart strings pull like other anime films for me. Although, I would say the art is outstanding and really pretty. (though I do wish when characters cry in anime, they make it more realistic with the face, too much perfection.)All this is just my opinion though. I would not say ""Don't watch it because it's crap"", I just think it's overrated."
" This is a wonderful movie!
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,10,"This review may contain spoilers!The film is not the same as the Disney animated genre，because it is a love animation，maybe, it is not a suitable all the age animation,but it is undoubtedly a good animation，if we look at ""La La Land"" - ""Titanic"" - that is, look at the point of view of love movies, this is certainly one can make the Oscar nomination and even win an Oscar award's movie.Because not all animations are Disney type, not all animations are 3d.The whole movie is ""Misubi"" as the story line，mainly about Tokyo high school student Taki and rural high school student Mitsuha the body is exchanged's story. In China, the film attracted countless people to see, and even some people read 5 times, 10 times, 20 times 30 times or even 60 times!This is how powerful the attraction ah！So, people who have not seen this movie, recommend you to see, even if you do not like the story, but beautiful pictures and excellent music will make you want to see a few times!"
" Brilliant, just brilliant
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,10,"I usually don't watch or even like Japanese animation and the fact that this was a romantic movie didn't help. i only watched this movie because I was board but what I didn't know that I'll be watching the best romantic movie yet.if you think that this will be another cheesy Hollywood movie then you're in for a surprise.the way the story evolved will keep breaking your heart and putting it back together.I'll just say this, if you're a person who looks for a good story then watch this movie, you'll find what you're looking for.and take it from one who rarely gives a 10-star rating."
" My heart has been seduced
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,9,"I'm not an huge anime fan, but even I can see the quality in this film.""Kimi no na wa"" tells a story of two teenage kids, who swap bodies. Such a simple premise becomes (thanks to stunning visuals, amazing direction, great plot and a extremely touching story) in one of the best animated films I have ever seen. Close to Ghibli's standards in terms of animation and imaginative story.Everything, from the character development to the animation works perfectly to subjugate and move the viewer to the point where it wont handle the tears. Not in a melodramatic and cloying way, but in a compelling and amusing way instead.This film will just amaze you."
" could be the greatest love story of all time
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,10,"In truth, the most competitive area of fiction is not invasions from outer space or talking dogs or impossible missions but rather the most basic narrative of all, the love story.And this is also the most overcrowded field, and the most difficult to do right.This film, this story, is extraordinary. It reminds me of MY SASSY GIRL, a love story from Asia that captured the imagination of the world and has almost become a franchise, it's been copied so many times.It also brings to mind Richard Matheson's classic BID TIME RETURN, another love story for the ages that uses time juxtaposition. (Done as the movie SOMEWHERE IN TIME, 1980).I already gave this the highest rating on the IMDb.The animation is stunning and complimentary to this one-of-a-kind tale.All things considered, I would like to avoid the ongoing arguments about which Japanese animation studio is better, or worse, than the other. I prefer to simply be grateful that Japanese anime exists at all, because I cannot imagine any other country producing something this moving, this powerful, in graphic form."

",2017-01-31 00:00:00,10,"I've never heard of this movie ever. But when I flew from Tokyo to Guam, this was part of the in-flight movies and it somehow made me choose it. and OH MY GOD! I was blown away by the movie! The English subtitles are perfect and i'm sure this should be watched this way rather than the dubbed version! You'll immediately relate with the characters cuz they're both funny and emotional at the same time. THE SOUNDTRACK AND MUSICAL SCORE WERE AWESOME!! All the songs played were just perfect, with a mix of pop, rock and simple piano pieces that made it all so dramatic and emotional. Love the music!!If you loved your visit to Japan, you should watch this! So Enchanting Indeed!!easiest 10 Stars Ever!! **********"
" Among the best of its genre
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,9,"The quality of animation and sound design in Your Name rival the likes of Akira and Studio Ghibli as does the level of creativity in its cinematography. These are what allow the film to generate laughter and then tears in succession with no diminishing returns. Likewise, Your Name is one of those movies whose plot repeatedly defies expectations and whose premise the audience will not likely pin down until the credits are rolling.Written with love and captivatingly delivered, Makoto Shinkai has written a story that would be done a disservice were it described only as a Slice of Life; a genre that Japanese animated and live cinema have already redefined. It is a love story, an Epic, a coming of age story and a comedy. Above all Your Name is quintessentially Japanese. Shinkai effortlessly synthesises life in rural, traditional Japan with the Westernised cityscape of Tokyo, draws on shared tragedy and explores the dual natures of progress and the loss of one's history. Your Name also bridges the gap between mythology and science-fiction. The effect of this blend is not to contrive the plot or overshadow the characters but rather serve to help realise both."
" magnificent a masterpiece for your eyes mind and your soul a must see in a life time
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,10,"this animated film is a masterpiece one of the best I have ever seen truly magical cannot say enough about it , and won't tell you the story summarised ,to avoid spoiling the story.. All I can say is that this film transports you and make you feel like in Japan, I actually had the chance to live 5 years in Tokyo in Minatoku area shown on the movie Arisugawa Coen actually (arisugawa gardens neighbourhood) and this masterpiece not only transports you to Tokyo but a small town in rural/traditional Japan and a magical small town that brought me many memories of my excursions to small lost towns close to Kyoto and Nara, the combinations or life realism and magic , spirituality the depth and yet simplicity both at the same time of the story makes this work a truly masterpiece that for me deserves to be among some of my favourite films such as the Godfather, Kurosawa movies, first old Lucas Star Wars, Cinemaparadiso and so on .. An unexpected wonderful surprise and for me a masterpiece God thanks they still make this masterpieces like this still nowadays this work sets and has a quality of its own, it is a rare almost extinct type of quality , soul and magic you hardly ever see nowadays.. wonderful script and story too..I LOVED Kimi no na wa. A must see !Ernest From Barcelona Spain now Living in Switzerland"
" This movie would make your heart heavy and then lighten it like nothing
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie is so beautiful,from the eye-popping animation to it's plot is flawless.Hands down one of the best anime movie ever.People often overlook anime as action but this movie's love story better than any romeo-Juliet.The starting makes you involve it with a humor base story which eventually turns a twist that their body stop swapping because the girl who he swaps body actually died 3 years ago,I was wtf at the moment but it was covered quick with tears.Some things are unpractical but this makes the movie more beautiful, I assume the ending can never be perfect by saying "" your name "", filled with my tears. Ps:- This movie OST perfectly matches the movie which always moves you."
" Too Good,Watch it alone,Judge carefully
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"I give this movie 9 only due to animation quality, it's good as movie too good as story, everything in this movie are appreciable. Hats off to the director Makoto Shinkai, for getting such a good thought, and as of I have heard, he got this idea from a anime Ranma 1/2. Well, I'm also an anime fan, and watched other anime movie. Other movies such as Spirited Away, are better than Kimi No Na Wa, but ""Garden of words"" one of my favorite Makoto movies has also been included in some scenes of the movie, so overall I can say Makoto has worked hard on this movie and he deserves every award he gets. Also the band Radwimps, have worked good for the song Zen Zen Zense, appreciable for each word. I hope Your Name releases in India soon, crosses 1 billion USD collections and wins an Academy Award. Hail Kimi No Na Wa, I can't wait."
" this movie make me falling in love with Makoto Shinkai
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,10,Your Name or Kimi no na wa in Japanese is a anime movie directed by Makoto Shinkai is probably one of the most epic love love story ever told in anime form i ever see.After hearing how much critic and media love this movie and say this is the best anime movie since Hayao Miyazaki era as an hardcore anime fan myself i am really exited to check this movie out when it hit my country theater.This is a very beautiful anime movie with each scene is a jaws dropping animations and a beautiful movie score that fit the mood of the movie perfectly.The character is very likable and i find myself investigate more into the side character and the environment not just the two main character.The movie balance the comedy and the emotion very well that when something really sad or really fun happen the audience can feel the same way as the character.Is this the best anime movie ever ? Who know but for the coming of age like i am this is a truly beautiful fun emotion ride and i can see people will talk a lot about this movie just like they did with Spirited Away when it first came out
" I feel like I'm always searching for someone, or something.
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,10,"I might have found it.I can only describe You Name as masterpiece a term that have only used for a small handful of films that I have watched throughout my life.I've seen Shinkai's previous films which I really enjoyed but this is his greatest work so far. Forget the comparisons to Miyazaki because although Your Name is beautifully animated, has a wonderful score and weaves a engrossing tale it has little in common with Miyazaki's work other than the media - that's not to say it's any lesser piece of work.If you have seen the trailer you'll probably think that this won't will be much different to other body swap films or anime that you might have seen, however Your Name is much more than that and deftly mixes various genres to make a very satisfying whole and everything about this film is pitch perfect.The first act sets up the body swap scenario and this section is sweet, funny and charming. It really helps the audience to get to know and care about the characters while it also mostly sidesteps many of the clichés as the body swap is less about gender and more about city vs countryside, modern vs tradition, dreams vs reality and of course distance.However as the first act comes to a close - just when you think you know where the film is going Miyazaki pulls the rug from under your feet with a twist that you won't see coming (despite some hints). Unlike most films where the 'big twist' seems tacked on or used in an attempt to make something seem clever, the twist in Your Name feels completely organic and deserved.It's here where the tone changes and that kind of shift is really hard to pull off however Miyazaki handles it brilliantly, as the tone shift never jars against the first act it actually compliments it!. The rest of Your Name has an utterly beautiful sense of melancholy and longing which most films would find hard to equal.I don't want to reveal any more about the film as you really need to experience for yourself. Needless to say that the films visuals are gorgeous but special mentions for the editing which I thought was amazing and the score and songs by Radwimps which really helped the film find it's heart.I don't often cry at films especially if it feels they are attempting to force an emotion from me. Beauty or genus tend to make me cry and for the last 15-20 minutes of Your Name tears streamed down my face.Highly recommended, a must see! You don't have to be an Anime fan to enjoy this!"
" Two star crossed lovers that travel through time.
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,10,"Beware. You might be ugly crying by the end of this one! It pulls on your heart strings from the very first scene in the film. The story weaves effortlessly back and forth between two people, telling a tale of star crossed love, a god of time and two of the most memorable characters I have seen in an Anime in a long time. The artistic direction leaves you feeling breathless at points with beautiful juxtiposition between the rural and city lifestyles the characters live in. The music score and direction in this film are key selling points, both beautiful and haunting. With key pieces placed in all the right places. I was glued to the edge of my seat the entire movie. I was never in a rush to get to the next scene, I just took it in, in all its glory and in the end it left me completely satisfied."
" Awesome
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,10,One of the best works of mark. It has exceeded my high expectations for by a mile. The emotions are thoroughly felt through out the movie.The irony of beloved ones turning into strangers and the desperation both the characters show and their struggle to stay together is very touching. The animation is lagging in some scenes but the overall movie is one of the best i ever watched. The good thing which gives warmth to the heart is that in the end both of them finally met each other. The ending for his other works like 5 centimeters per second leave a person with tears but this movie has it all. I would recommend this to every anime fan and also to those looking for a movie full of emotions.
" an enchanting journey
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,9,"FIrst off let me start by saying I'm not familiar with any works of this legendary Ghibli and their works, nor Shinkai Makoto's previous work to compare this to any of that product. I'll simply write this review as someone who has seen the movie and find it enjoyable.As someone who has seen some Japanese animated works, I can say that Kimi no Na Wa is very well done. It is not your usual cartoon, there're so much dynamics in the picture and note that the landscape are very beautifully drawn and it really has very gorgeous scenes from time to time.The voice actors were brilliant, and I strongly suggest you see the sub version rather than the dub (I don't know how the dub will be done but the Japanese voice actors is nothing sort of amazing, especially considering that they have to voice a boyish/normal girl and a girlish/normal boy throughout the movie).The plot is relatively simple, but some twist make it very special. While it's true that this theme of girl and boy swapping bodies is not entirely new, Kimi no Na Wa elaborate it more: showing the anxiety and enjoyment that the two have without abusing it's sexual aspects and in turns build a unique bonds between the main protagonists which make their struggle to find each other more meaningful.The feeling of Japanese culture can be felt throughout the movies, with traditional symbols, such as ceremonies, braided cord, the shrine, forest, and also with dialogues, but it never felt boring as they are very beautifully paced.The music are well composed, and well timed. They bring so much emotions to the scenes. I have never heard anything from RADWIMPS before but they were brilliant on all singles they have on this movie.Anyway, it was a very enjoyable ride, and satisfying experience for me. It's a pity I have never got the chance to see it the 2nd time. If they release a blue ray, I would try to get my hand on it. Also, I'll recommend anyone who watch this search for the novel as well, it describes some of the characters' thought that the movie can't show.It's not really 'perfect'. There are some part of the plot that seems questionable, but for all it is, Kimi no Na Wa is a beautiful and enjoyable emotional ride, it will enchant you through it's 100 minutes duration."
" A Sad Attempt at Channelling Donnie Darko
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,2,"Your Name has nice animation.It is also a very soulless rehash of the much more entertaining story found in the film Donnie Darko. A catastrophe occurs and time travel/science magic makes a story possible. Only in Your Name, the story will be filled with painfully predictable and empty characters who end up succumbing to only-very-slightly-refined (if that) anime tropes. I don't remember the character's names so I'll just say boy and girl. They switch bodies for some reason. The girl becomes the boy and vice versa. However, it becomes a series of gags. Enjoy.In Donnie Darko, a plane engine crashes to earth and the main character, Donnie, is killed. However, the story of Donnie Darko actually takes us on a mind-bending journey that shows how this comes about. Your Name does not even attempt this. Tokyo is a dirty city. Your Name does not show the dirty side of Tokyo. Viewers will be given glistening and idyllic views of train stations that torment the life out of millions of people everyday. This is no Blade Runner; you will not see a speck of filth. Completely confused as to why this animated film is given any respect. Sure, Ghibli films are filled with the same idyllic scenery, but there is (almost) always something more to appreciate *cough* storytelling *cough* .2/10 out of respect for the poor souls who had to render such sparkling scenes in spite of knowing they were bull****."
" Whow
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,10,"The best way I can describe the quality of this anime is that, halfway into the view, I had to watch the end to make sure it wasn't a 5mm/sec thing. First: we find a perfect integration with the previous works, in a very gentle way. I jumped up when I saw the name of the Italian restaurant, for example, or the teacher... a zen garden of references. Second: it covers all emotions within the human spectrum of feelings. From funny to desperate to hatred. Amazing how the characters, and the plot, move so naturally from one state of mind to another. Nothing dramatic has to happen: it's all so natural. Third: the plot is original and unpredictable. ""You never know what you are gonna get next"". Fourth: sometimes it's not the devil, hiding into details, but perfection. This is it, I could go on for hours. This anime shocked me in a very positive way. Work of genius."
" This movie is incredible.
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,"This movie is absolutely incredible. I don't even know how to start describing this masterpiece.The plot revolves around a topic that has been dealt with way too often, but this movie manages to avoid the stereotypical challenges. Nothing about this movie is predictable which is an achievement nowadays. It doesn't play too much on emotions, but will make the viewer laugh, smile, and shed a tear.The music takes a real place in the narration, and is not there just to fill the atmosphere.The visuals are just breath-taking and bring a sparkle to the viewer's eyes.It was the first time I saw a movie made by Makoto Shinkai, but I will definitely try to see his other works. I am not used to Japanese animation, but this one is really easy to watch and the viewer does not need a deep knowledge of the Japanese culture to understand the depth of this movie, as the folklore is well explained."
" Indian guy fell in love with this movie...the most awesome romantic movie there is
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,10,"One of the major drawback of being an otaku in India is that anime is still part of a small subculture and so getting to watch anime by legit sources is difficult. You can't buy DVDs because they are not available, Funimation and Crunchyroll aren't active in India and few people get animax on their TVs and these few of those few people realise its worth. So, I started watching anime with pokemon in 2002 when i was four, followed it with Cyborg 009 and Dragon ball z. At a point, I had to stream Dragon ball z in 2009 at really slow speeds. I got 20mbps now but getting to watch anime is still a difficult task. Getting to watch Your Name(Kimi no Na wa) too was difficult but trust me it was worth it.So, this story is about a countryside girl, Mitsuha and a city boy, Taki(that's an awkward sentence) who switch their bodies while they think they are dreaming but the truth is something else...I didn't even read the plot before watching the movie due to the amazing critical reception and highly positive word-of-mouth. I mean that's what Indians do. But it is more than safe to say that this movie has surpassed my expectations. Silver Linings Playbook is not my favorite romantic movie anymore. This movie has outpaced major Indian romantic movies by miles.What makes it so special is the original and highly compelling story line. There is good character development, especially the main characters, Mitsuha and Taki. I can't decide who I like more, Mitsuha or Taki. There is no mistake in the movie that can be seen by the naked eye and even if there was one, this movie's emotional aspect is so strong that it would have overshadowed the mistakes. I can't comment about voice acting here because i don't really understand Japanese. Subtitles are still my best friends. The visuals are striking and beautiful, especially Itomori ones. The degree of the fantasy angle is just right. It leaves people wanting more. Expect many gasps and sighs. The characters do get familiar with each other's lives but there always remains a sense of awkwardness and alien nature of each other's lives. The chemistry between the main characters is very good and it's the way they handle each other's lives that makes audience praise it and write reviews. Tear jerkers please keep tissues at your side. You will need them. Watch this one with your partner even if he/she is not into anime."
" Not impressed
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,1,"Had high expectations due to the hype and I liked Shinkai's previous works, but was disappointed that it really wasn't special. The plot is bland and predictable, the mystery not quite so mysterious, and you're expected to suspend disbelief but then one would expect an incredible journey that makes it all worthwhile when in reality it's all rather pedestrian of the usual teenage pulp romance genre. The implausible we are asked to believe thus becomes rather irritating - when the great unraveling of the ""mystery"" is anything but.I far prefer Studio Ghibli's wistfulness and sensitivity in their approach - there's something magical and enthralling in their hinting at young romance. Even in the realm of the impossible, eg Arietty, the story-telling is compelling enough to make the deeper currents palpable.Oh well, different strokes and all that..."
