" Amazing Visual Effects, Story lacked
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,7,"The original Oku story is way better, should have had the missing characters, it missed a great opportunity, this had Vampires, people with psychic abilities had crazy strong Man, this arc was amazing before the fall manga in my eyes, hated that it did not show kei actual death by the vamps. Hated that they nerfed the blood this was a gory manga"
" So so
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,6,"Story good, graphics good, speaks bad.How many times kill the boss i didnt count."
" Great surprise
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,7,"Found this hidden gem scrolling Netflix, and was really impressed. Never heard of Gantz, but was left wanting more!"
" All-Time Favourite Anime....a Masterpiece!
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,10,Brilliant Concepts....stunning visuals and awesome characters! An all-time favourite and Masterpiece!
" Great action packed animation
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,8,"Tech katanas, mechs, lasers and demons all with awesome animations and a nice linear good vs bad guy plot, does it need anything more!?
As the title suggests, GANTZ:O is a pretty good action themed animation. I read there is a bigger background to it, but even though I don't have any particular knowledge of it, the movie was still enjoyable and understandable.
Also, there are no tedious parts with long explanations since in most of the screen time there is some kind of battle taking place. The animations are all on point and eye pleasing.
All in all, if you are an animation fan then it's definitely worth a view. (lang: Japanese, subs: Eng)"
" Great visual spectacle, little to no plot
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,5,"I enjoyed this as if it were a very long, cool videogame cut scene, but there is very little substance here. Barely any story, zero character development, poor dialogue, and maybe I'm starting to show my age but the oversexualization of female characters in anime is starting to bother me a lot, especially when it feels very out of place like in a purely action oriented movie like this one."
" An enjoyable diversion
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,7,"I was a big fan of the anime series, but I went in assuming this would be terrible.The animation and action is great, but the dialogue is truly awful. The explanation of what's going on is lacking a little, and I'm not sure someone who'd missed the series would have a full grasp. Then again, I'm not sure it would add anything to this film as a standalone.A bit of fun."
" GANTZ:0
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,9,I was blown away a by the animation and creativity. The characters and villains are true to depictions of things we all seen in horror movies with a dark twisted side that could only be brought to life through animation. This is genius work on multiple levels and the story line is great also. This just arrived on Netflix recently (2020) I wish there was another movie and a series done exactly the same way. Keep my attention with so many details and action. Any level of amine watching with be pleased.
" 10 Stars For The Animation Alone!
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,10,"When I watched this, I kept flipping back and forth between believing that this movie was fully animated or it was real life people wearing CGI suits and a whole lot of extra CGI on top of that. I still don't know which one's true. But if this was 100% animated, then the animators have done a phenomenal job because the movie looked very realistic.I'm not a huge fan of horror but this movie sold it to me mainly because of its visuals. And honestly, I was kind of meh about the ""romance"" in this movie but the fight scenes were great. I loved how the only two female characters basically carried the final showdown with the boss monster, even though later Reika believed that it was Kato who did most of the job. NO, that's not what I saw. Kato was a pretty lame protagonist and he pissed me off most of the time because he was so weak and lame up until the end."
" Excelente
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,10,Excelente la historia la animación. Increíblemente real.
" Fresh and Terrific
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,10,"Great story. CGI is v.good. I've not watched many full 'real style' cgi but I couldn't imagine this done any other way.The creation of the fight scenes/monsters is really a sight to behold...fantastic ideas and right off the chart...excellent!For me it was gripping, exciting, trippy, funny with much more of a story than I thought...superb!My only criticism would be some of the black looked fuzzy at the beginning? I didn't notice it after 15m"
" Beautiful but that's it
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,5,"Good animations. But god damn I hated the self obsessed main character, with his ""I have to do this"" attitude, putting everyone else in danger to rescue him.
And they´re all braindead and slow, found myself yelling at the screen SHOOT THEN GOD DAMN IT! They just stand there like idiots."
" Fun
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,6,"Visually stunning and with lots of great action.The emotional moments don't quite work, but let's face it, that's not what we're here for.This was a ton of fun."
" Gratuitous and Flashy
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,3,"Good animation, some nice sound effects. The action is nonsensical fun. Gratuitous nudity, as per usual with these Japanese animated films. A character has large breasts that bounce and jiggle even in the ""hi-tech suit"" thing. Unnecessary and pretty much ruined the movie. Just unnecessary dweeb pandering. Sure sex sells, but it doesn't always mean happy customers."
" Por in history and really bad characters
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,3,"The only thing that can be saved are the special effects. The history has no depth, cheap dialogs with no identification between characters that can be believable.
It does not worth the effort."
" Nice but incomplete
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,6,"I dont usually watch animated but this one was entertaining with good looking bad-asses monsters and good fights. Nice Animation design, realistic but so many things weren't said..."
" Gantz reboot! Yeeea... wait a minute
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,7,"If Gantz 1 was mediocre and Gantz 2 terrible, they thought: let's redo it, not as anime, not as live version, but as 3D CGI animation! And yes, it works, however it has some major flaws. First, the story is slightly changed, so you don't know where this is coming from. Is it a sequel, a prequel, is it the manga story, the anime story, the live version story? In the end it's like a Final Fantasy based on Gantz movie with extra heroic heroes and bigger guns."
" Pretty But Confusing
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,3,"Fans of the Gantz series will love this movie. Others will be confused.What's Good: The CGI animation is simply amazing. Skin-tight outfits that accentuate the (female) body serves as eye candy, but makes sense in the context of the movie. The weapons are somewhat varied and cool. The characters are interesting, too.What's Bad: Unless you're familiar with with Gantz manga or anime series, this movie will be confusing. At a run-time of 90 minutes, there was sufficient time to build up even a little bit of context. Instead, the movie went for all action with no explanation. In other words, it is a movie for fans only.And that, ultimately, is why despite all the good points, ""Gantz: O"" - with the O for Osaka - doesn't get a higher rating."
" The writing is on the wall.
",2019-08-17 00:00:00,6,"I don't follow animation carefully but I do note when there are transitions to higher levels and what I see in this rather silly movie is a level of animation realism, or naturalism if you prefer. The writing is truly on the wall for studio actors because we are now approaching the ability of the animator to make movies that seem entirely real without ever leaving their studio. No longer will producers have to hire temperamental and over priced actors to appear in their films. They can simply hire temperamental and over priced animators. In this film you can see the day when the producer can scan the script into a computer, make a few thumbnail sketches, load up the voice generator, and let the machines fun over the weekend and when they come in on Monday they will have their version of Hamlet or anything else. It is almost here."
" A non playable 3rd person shooter.
",2019-08-09 00:00:00,1,"... featuring one dimensional characters, risible dialogue and a paper thin plot. You might enjoy it if you're 10."
" Typical, shallow spectacle
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,7,"Yet another anime-ish movie, with similar strenghts and weaknesses to Netflixes Ajin. Great spectale, good action, but no worldbuilding whatsoever. What are the Oni / somethings that attack Osaka? What is Gantz? The movie doesn't even attempt to explain those things. I suppose this is somewhere in anime, manga or whatever, but this movie - as a standalone movie on Netflix - is void of any world building. Shame. Anyway, 7 stars for insane monster creativity."
" easily the best manga adaptation
",2019-05-23 00:00:00,9,The animation and art is the best I've seen in this genre. Wish these directors had a new project. Wish they made more of these.
" Stunning visual effects, lousy plot & dialogues
",2019-05-01 00:00:00,6,"Very good CGI, very cool monsters but the worst dialogues I've ever seen in a movie, even for a manga."
" It's amazing
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,10,"I didn't know this movie has released until now
Even I'm quite confusing with the beginning of the movie cuz it's not same as manga did but I'm knew that I'm totally wrong when I saw the endingAmazing and magnificent movie anime so far that I've watch"
" There was more nudity in the anime, but perfect adaptation otherwise
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Let's make this immediately very very clear: the score comes all from Gantz fans, and if you don't know what a ""Gantz"" is, you are in the really wrong place.If you didn't read the anime, the movie is an abominable mess of pitch-perfect CGI, atrocious human interactions and unintelligible plot, and if you want to get the most out of it, you'd probably better watching it with no audio and skipping all parts where the characters are moving their lips. Possibly with a soundtrack of your choice in background.I think the Spice Girl would do :)Or... you are a Gantz fan, and you read and loved the manga: then the dialogues and characterizations will remain atrocious (and very Japanese), but you'll be in for the best adaptation of the source material you can ask a Japanese director: lay back and enjoy the ride!The CGI is astonishing. I still can't believe I've just watched a rendering and not actual footage, and the movie is packed with breath-taking action. Then the characters speak.You know when you watch a Bollywood movie and, at some point, the hero and the bad guy start to dance together for what seems like an eternity, where they were about to kill each other the moment before? It's an ""Indian thing"", right? It's ""their thing"".Well... wooden, out of place dialogues, long tirades about morality and non-sequiturs about duty and honor repeated and repeated forever is a ""Japanese"" thing, I suppose. And they do it a lot.There is also the 5 minutes scene where the maimed hero drags himself on the brink of death with super-human determination to save the day. The whole package (save for the cherry blossoms: there are none to be found. Is this a spoiler?).Mind you, I'm not judging: God only knows how our movies look to a Japanese audience, but if you want to watch this, be prepared that 80% of the movie is awesome action, and the remaining 20% is cringe-worthy dialogues (by Western standards, at least).Worth watching for fans, worth scanning for everyone else."
" Impressive...
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,7,"I was recommended that I watched ""Gantz: O"" since it was readily available on Netflix some time ago. So I did as recommended, even without having any prior knowledge of the ""Gantz"" series and franchise.One word is really all that is needed to summarize ""Gantz: O"", and that word is: wow!The storyline was really good, and the entire movie had a really interesting concept to it. Actually to the point where it sparked an interest in delving further into the ""Gantz"" franchise and explore more and learn more about the universe in which it takes place.""Gantz: O"" is brimming with fast paced and intense action from beginning to end. Just as it is packed with some really cool and great-looking CGI, which really helped bring the movie to life. Visually, then ""Gantz: O"" was astounding to behold, no doubt about that.The characters in the movie were quite interesting and fleshed out nicely on the screen and throughout the storyline. Which was good, because that makes you connect with the characters and form a bond of sorts. And characters are very important in a movie. So naturally, they needed a good voice acting ensemble for the movie, which they luckily also had. The voice acting talents is a make or break deal for a movie such as this.""Gantz: O"" is well worth watching if you have the chance. I was more than genuinely entertained with the movie, and am glad that I listened to the recommendation and sat down to watch it."
" good pseudo Game movie, but lacks of content & answers
",2018-12-10 00:00:00,7,"The idea is very good, a pseudo action RPG game in real life with uknown creatures.
The graphics are good and the monsters are original, very dark.
But the most important was that after the movie ended, it left me with lot of questions like, are the points accumulable ? why do the veterans never leave the game ? why the lady and old man were so bad & unskilled if they played before?
why the protagonist, cant remember anything if he can leave the room after the end of the mission, why not write notes, etc ?. If the veterans were so good at the game, but in this mission they died, then the game is increasing the difficulty, so in the next mission, the humans will be extincted ? ?
My rating is 6.5, but this movie could be very good, I hope if there is a second part, they give some answers."
" Just...wow
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,10,"Watched this on Netflix, and I am impressed! The details, monsters, fights, story. Very entertaining. Thank you for making this move, a master piece!"
" Outstanding Graphics, Everything Else Sucks Really Bad
",2018-10-19 00:00:00,4,"Without the stunning graphics, I would rate this 2/10.Characters are infuriatingly stupid, so much so that I began rooting for the monsters to kill them all.
1. Characters armed with energy guns capable of ranged fire routinely advance to within arm's reach of monsters, or they just wait out in the open for monsters to come within arm's reach, before firing their weapons.
2. Characters routinely engage in lengthy discussions rather than firing their weapons, when the monsters are right in front of them or even hitting them.
3. Characters routinely show boat around monsters they THINK are dead, only to be killed/injured when the monster recovers and attacks.Remember the biologist from Prometheus, the one that tried to pet the alien cobra monster? Remember the geologist that somehow got lost in the Engineer lab complex even though his drones made a 3-D map of it? Remember the daughter who keeps running straight while the crashed Engineer ship is falling over her? Yeah, these Gantz characters are THAT stupid! I could barely stand to finish watching this."
" Gantz
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,7,"Finished the new cgi film Gantz.0. The graphics are outstanding! The film is pure eye candy. Gantz is known for its gore and high body count and the film delivered in both regards. The story was a bit basic, but not unenjoyable. The characters and their motivations are also thin. Honestly the movie was all about the in your face action and gore. It definitely delivered in both regards. Overall a 7 out of 10."
" If you have ever seen Final Fantasy: Advent Children, you will like this.
",2018-09-20 00:00:00,9,"This is one of those movies that I have seen on Netflix, thought it looked interesting, and would then scroll by. I wish I would've watched it sooner! 
The main thing that grabbed my attention was the similarities between the CGI in this film compared to Final Fantasy. Other than that I went into this movie completely oblivious to any of it's background. Even without that knowledge I still found it enjoyable. Some of the action scenes happen so fast and in a dark setting, so I had to play around with the picture mode on my TV to get it to look the right way. Music selection was spot on for helping to set the mood and build intensity. I noticed in many of the other reviews people talking about the dialogue being weak and dry. I would suspect this is because they watched the English dub version. If that is the case then I can confirm that watching, really any movie, outside of it's original language you are going to drasticaly miss out on key dialogue inflections. Also, since the language translates slightly different some of the dialogue will be changed, making some of the one-liners seem even more painful. 
I may have to go back and watch it again sometime because the end of the movie left me a little confused and feeling like I may have missed out on some hints throughout. 
As I said, great action/fantacy film that is well worth your time to watch!"
" Outstanding
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,10,This is one of the most exciting anime I've seen in a while. The action never let's up and just pop up all kind of baddass creatures. I have to say I was also just blown away by the visuals. A must to watch to action fans
" Surprised
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,7,Better than I expected. I thought it would be for kids but it wasn't. It looked amazing. The monsters were so interesting. The one that turned into a bunch of naked ladies was so unique. The ending could have been better though it was pretty confusing
" Just the best animated movie ever!!
",2018-04-26 00:00:00,10,"The animation is the best I´ve ever seem in my life (At the very beginning I even thought for a minute that Reika was a real woman). the story I understand isn´t the exact original one, but taking into account that this movie is just an introduction to the Story of Ganz in an hour and a half lenght movie, Come on!! We can´t ask the creators to make a perfect adaptation of the story, and Believe me when I say that the adaptation coulnd´t be any better even though the chronology isn´t the best. I´ve seem the anime and read the manga and the story on this movie is pretty close to the manga. I just hope you guys can also make a movie for the Italian Alien mission (Ohh My God!!!!) I´d pay to see it. And thank you for your great work, you guys are amazing!!."
" Best adaptation of Gantz manga so far
",2018-04-04 00:00:00,8,"Gantz: o has an amazing animation sometimes feels real, but the plot of the film is a bit confusing for new gantz viewers and for those who have read or seen the anime with the same name could feel out of place the story due to the changes made to convert gantz as a standalone film, compared to the original work in the film the protagonist lacks an objective and this makes it difficult to sympathize with him."
" Impressive visuals n lots of monster action.
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,8,"Hav never been a fan of certain Japanese films due to their weird gore n story.
Havent read any of their manga. 
As for the Gantz, without having any exposure to its video game, manga, anime n action films, i was pleasantly surprised n happy to see this movie on a dvd. Imagine the fun on big screen.
In one word, Gantz:O is an impressive visual spectacle. The movie is filled with style, awesome action sequences n terrific monster designs. The monsters were good. The editing is top notch n thankfully the hand held cam stuff n quick cut editing is nada n most of the action happens in proper light so you can actually follow what is going on.
The characters appeared realistic with their facial expressions n body language.
After watching this movie, i have become a fan of the Gantz series n looking forward to its sequels.
They hav included one weird scene, a weird old man transforms into a naked woman n then into multiple naked women... after all its a Jap movie."
" GREAT!!
",2018-01-15 00:00:00,8,"I am a gantz old fan and i can say this really feel like gantz, and the animation its awesome."
" laughable dialogue
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,1,"Just laughable dialogue, how on earth is this mature with this childish dialogue"
" Great visuals, but horrible writing
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,6,"Positives - fight scenes, with sci-fi sword-fighting, and boobs. Negatives - Plot so vague you want to kill yourself.The pure stupidity in the script is so bad, it's not hilarious, or cringey, it makes you want to jump off the highest building you can find. Our main character is mentally disabled, looks nothing like a 17 year old, has ""romance"" with a 23 year old, and actively looks for ways to kill himself, even tho he has a sibling to take care of. The dialogue is so retarded, you might just want to disable the subs after the first 20 minutes and then turn it back on at the end, you will save yourself a headache. The plot explains absolutely nothing about the game and it hurts more than helps."
" Stunning!
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,8,"As with other reviewers here I came across this little gem browsing Netflix.I guess Gantz is pretty big in Japan for them to be able to make something this amazing. The animation and overall design quality is simply incredible. Any mature anime fan will love this regardless of knowing the backstory.The main reason I'm ""reviewing"" this title is because I see many people complaining about the laughable dialogue. To circumvent this, watch it in it's original Japanese language with subtitles!"
" A must watch for fans of science-fiction
",2017-07-21 00:00:00,10,"The actions scenes are really good and the science fiction story holds you from the very beginning. The animations are top notch and have a totally unique style, much different from what we are used to see in Pixar movies. If you like science fiction you should watch it right now."
" Great anime quality, director ship and sticking close to the manga
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,10,"Gantz was my first and favourite manga i read, I've watched the TV show and was disappointed it discontinued early in.after losing hope that Gantz was finished a few years back i stumbled across this movie per chance and could not believe how much effort was put in.It has truly rekindled my flame for Gantz and would love to throw money for a Gantz:1, Gantz:2, Gantz:3 etc of this quality.I'd even recommend it for first time viewers not knowledgeable of the manga"
" Throwing you into it
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,8,"I haven't read the Manga, but I have seen the TV show and the two real live action movies. So I'm aware of the concept of the movie. But if you haven't any idea what this is about, you get thrown into the water and you might be confused at first. But it's a great thing to do. I personally think, the really crazy and action packed beginning works very nicely for everyone.But don't worry, after the introduction (if you can call it that), we get the real introduction where things get explained a bit. The animation is really good and the violence level (as in how explicit it is shown) is very high. There's also some nudity, but in a very horrific kind of way. The pace is frantic and the demon world is mixed up with the real world ... with some ambiguous results ..."
" Worth watching
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,9,"Cruising through Netflix I mostly see B grade movies and came across this title. I've seen some older anime and would usually rather watch a real life movie rather than an animation but the choices on Netflix have dried up quickly and I finally decided to try this. And it was a great choice I must say. Right from the start the action kicks in and as the other reviewers pointed out, the CG/animation looks absolutely awesome. It actually took a few moments of looking closely at the humans to tell if they were real or not. The details of shadows, reflections, glints, motion, fire, everything seems to push the envelope of computer power to render this smooth detail. Just incredible. The creatures were highly imaginative and some made me laugh. The battles were slick and sick. Having no knowledge of Gantz backstory (if one exists), leaves many gaps in understanding what/why is all going on. The main character himself is not given enough/any information as to what the heck is going on so the viewer (me) has no clue as to what/why is going on. For example:Why are there all these creatures, what is their purpose, who created the Gantz-ball-thing, why are humans randomly (?) chosen, if other teams have killed the monsters why do more appear, is this phenomenon only in Japan or is it world wide, etc. If this movie considers that the viewer has pre-knowledge of Gantz then there is no problem. However, I was totally lost without those answers, yet the movie was a total spectacle and impressive nonetheless. I gave it a 9 based on the sheer scope of anime work and imagination. It must be a giant in it's genre. Worth watching for sure, better than most real live movies I've seen on Netflix."
" Roller-coaster action, let down hugely by no script.
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,4,"Great animation - particularly of human action movements and camera work. Great CGI - wonderfully varied monsters and weaponry, although the appearance of the Mech in my opinion was almost too much eye candy. The screen suddenly got so busy I didn't know which where to look - a bit like Transformers, at times there's so much going on you lose any real focal point. Visually, this is a gorgeous movie. But that's where it stops.The script is not just utterly devoid of anything intelligent or meaningful, it's far worse. The squeaky, repetitive, persistent dialogue from Anzu, and her (combined with Reika) constant failure to pull the trigger on ANY weapon at ANY time (apart from the end) will have you ripping your hair out.The absolute lack of any character development will leave you wondering who these people were. Kato at least has some background fill, but the rest are basically empty shells with voice cords. In a sense, the movie remains true to the original comics which had very sparse dialogue. But I can't help feel that director Kawamura completely failed to support such a visual feast with at least a moderate script. This one could have been written in block capitals on the back of a postage stamp. Watch once, for the fabulous weaponry, the wicked suits (especially Reika's of course) and the cracking animation. Then I'll pretty much guarantee you'll be consigning the movie to a dusty back shelf, or your digital equivalent."
" Fun Anime Romp
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,8,"Didn't know what to expect. Lets I went into it hoping to find something interesting and perhaps thrilling and I got that in aces. Hell, alien morphing demonic creatures...count me in! I never even heard of Gantz before, but it didn't take me long to understand the basic premise and rules of ""the game"" even though at the end I still had more questions then answers, but I'm fine with that, I don't need to have everything spoon fed and tied up with a nice bow.Sure the dubbing/translations are bad.. but I've gotten used to that in this type of art form, and it adds a bit to the charm.Its kinda a bit like Akira and the power rangers had a latex and neon clad love child. A goofy but exciting watch."
" Don't watch this movie
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,1,"This movie is very well animated, however it has no other redeeming qualities at all. The dubbing is terrible, all the characters are just anime stereotypes, every scene is beyond over-dramatic, and there is an underling misogynistic tone that makes this movie completely unbearable. If you like anime I cannot recommend this, if you like to watch bad movies because you think they're funny, I cannot recommend this because there is nothing funny about how bad it is. It's just bad."
" What a Breathless Movie!!!
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,9,"Honestly, so far this is the best Gantz in screen representation. A great comeback to fix the reputation of Gantz. Far better than 2 Live Action Movies that we've got.If you are new to Gantz, this will be your animated movie that had thrill, action, noir and horror in balanced setup. Even if you confused of what Gantz and Tokyo team used to be, you still can enjoy the game. Even they skip in (almost) last battle, there are still explanation what this game is all about. Its just complete menu i say.For animated movie, the colors, graphs, movement, detail, expression and gesture is almost perfect. You can compare it with latest Final Fantasy movie.I hope they don't stop in this movie. I hope Kurono's run is following after this. Last word, Hold your breath deeply :)"
" Surreal Visual Animation !! Simplistic Script.
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,8,"This Final, I do not see anyone commenting on the final look of the protagonist. What surreal animation, no doubt. If the script was more developed, it would certainly be a modern classic, like Akira, Ghost in the shell ... But unfortunately the script is very simplistic, which makes the film extremely shocking from a visual point of view, but little impact in the story, which ends up reflecting on the characters, and we have an incredible cyberpunk here, but as I said, If the script and the characters were better worked. Fantastic director Yasushi Kawamura, I do not know him, but this guy has to stand out and make other movies, damn, fantastic visual creative animation.And this end, really made me curious, what the protagonist witnessed."
" A-freaking-mazing!
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,9,"have been a fan of the manga/anime for years; it's one of the few series that does not rely on the overused tropes in Japanese animation. It is not afraid to tell a depressing story that ends on a sour note, and it does not shy away from killing even the seemingly most important characters. This is an action movie with an anime fan in mind; it starts at 10 and rarely lets up. The animation, the character designs, the motion capture; everything culminates into such a thoroughly engrossing experience, that I did not want to blink in case I might miss something. As a fan of movies, it is impressive. As a fan of anime/manga, it is impressive. As a fan of both, you will be hard pressed to find movies that are this well done and this entertaining from any country, in any genre. One of the best movies I have seen so far this year, it deserves to be seen by anyone who just appreciates a good time. A treat from start to finish, I will be buying it on bluray, I loved it so much."
" Amazing. Period.
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,10,"I have nothing to add to the other 10 out of 10 reviews for this amazing movie, except to say that the backstory doesn't matter. I don't read Manga and had no idea what this series was about and it didn't diminish my enjoyment at all. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to grasp the premise of the movie. Just sit back and enjoy one heck of a ride. The animation was jaw-dropping and the character development was spot on. I was actually rooting for most of the characters and the monsters were terrifically horrible. This movie was perfection. It's easily one of the 10 best movies I've seen in the last year. Treat yourself."
" A real masterpiece
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,10,"Gantz:O It's completely based on Osaka arc (not present in anime, just in Manga), this is one of the best arc of Gantz and one of the most incredible battles ever to come, the film takes a few small liberties just for Putting some characters in a simpler context of comprehension, is an extreme homage to the fans who were not disappointed at all and an excellent inter-training for anyone who has never heard of gantz, since it brings a film with moments of tension and unparalleled quality visual."
" Like a certain Video game, Pretty to look at, but painful story
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,6,"Remember that old video game format of beat the boss, but wait - he's back again and this time he's bigger! You know the type: The kind of game that you have to battle the same boss again and again, wondering if this time he's really gone. That's Gantz in a nutshell, only it's a game you'd never want to play because the weapons are illogical, frustrating garbage, and because it would be a real nightmare.As others have said, the cgi animation is on a different level and is stunning in its execution. Creative camera angles and use of lighting make the environments and characters pop with a distinct style that is reminiscent of the final fantasy movies, only with more demons and a lot more blood; buckets of blood.The story centres around a young man who dies, only to find himself resurrected in a deadly game where he and others are pitted against demons, given the glimmer of hope that he can be reunited with his brother if he does well. Taking place over the course of only one session of the game, the film does a decent job of introducing the mysterious black ball that bears the name Gantz and the rules of the game. Unfortunately, the game itself becomes more interesting than any of the characters themselves, and the viewer learns quickly not to be attached to most of them in the process.Despite having a story that is simplistic, it is not that which detracts most from the experience, but the tedious delay with which most elements of the action suffer. The guns used by the players, for example, are not projectile weapons but energy based and have an infuriating delay between firing the weapon and producing any result. Characters stand for long periods of time, pointing, but not using their weapons, at the enemies around them. More than incompetence, the delays seem to be deliberate decisions by the director to increase tension, but these delays instead result in breaking the viewer out of the moment. The heroic and emotional death of one character becomes comedy as he succeeds in killing his opponent, but only seconds after he has already died.Taking into account the style and visual power Gantz brings to the table, the film comes out ahead as a worthy addition to the Gantz anime family. It's a story that is easy to forget, but an experience that will likely make an impression, even if only for its bizarre renditions of Japanese demons."
" A little gift for manga's fan
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,9,"As a manga fan i'm feeling grateful that this doesn't turn into crappy cgi and reduce like 50% of the storyline just like the live-action. The CGI is absolutely beautiful and the character design is really attractive. But sadly they remove a few iconic scene from the manga (maybe because too gore and not appropriate). Another cons is the voice actor, especially the female leads, somehow it's a bit off. they could've find more fitting one. Overall it's amazing, i'm fully enjoyed it especially as it manga fans."
" Great action, TERRIBLE dialogue and writing.
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"OK, lets start off by saying I love Gantz... but this, no.I watched the English dub (bad idea I know) and I was very disappointed.Animation rocks, great fight scenes and action.A 17 yr old high school kid goes from zero to hero in 2 hours getting a model/ idol AND a 23 yr old mom to fall in love with him setting up his harem for life. Anzu and Reika are useless and annoying throughout. Suzuki is cannon fodder and the whole thing just gives me a headache. I think my main issue with the film is something literally unforgivable... he chooses to abandon his 10yr old brother to continue chilling with his harem. Im not going to lie, this ""reasoning"" has probably influenced me as it to this day outrages me.The Voice Actors for the dub are awful (nothing new there) and I recommend watching this in Japanese with English subs."
" I don't really know what the hell just happened.
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,8,":this is less of a review and more of just a ramble of what was in my head at the time I finished watching: As I would consider myself more a member of the ""uninitiated"" as far as anime is concerned, I really don't. I troll Netflix for the occasional anime. If it's available in English, I give it a shot. Many fail to hold my attention, this one did not. If you want a rundown of what it's about, others covered that just fine. But I'm here as someone who doesn't watch anime in it's native language with subtitles because it's ""more authentic"". Honestly, I'm a bored American who mostly fancies anime in the ""ecchi"" category for the laughs. I just spent 20 minutes cruising IMDb because I had no idea Gantz had a history. Never heard of it before. I'll admit, I'm still kinda confused. But I was entertained. I actually watched it. Most stuff that I put on Netflix is mostly to occupy the ADD side of my brain while I do something else. Gantz:O had my full attention and I'm gonna say that it's worth yours as well. Unless you're a purist, but this review isn't for you. I will say, I hope they do more of these in the 3DCG in the future. :ramble over:"
" This is when backstory becomes dreadfully important
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,5,"I was surfing Netflix and came across this title and decided to watch it because the stills looked good and it had a good rating. Should have read the reviews... The CGI is absolutely incredible, I'm honestly blown away. The industry has always had trouble getting humans right, but that being said the work in this one is just... photo-realistic level. The monsters are absolutely bizarre (reminds me of RIPD a little), beautifully rendered, but bizarre designs. The combat is pretty well done, although they really should have done more of it. And let's not forget the jiggly boobs, because what is anime without them am I right?Aaannnd that's just about all the good I have to say about it. The plot is inexplicable without the backstory that I'm oblivious to, and the dialogue is atrociously bad. Still a better love story than Twilight."
" Quite meh experience
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,5,"Gantz was a good read as a manga because you could skip trough the lamer parts and just view is as a pure action title - which was its strongest part. The fights were entertaining, the art was lovely dark, some of the ideas were actually decently original and the gory 'live or die' policy gave the series a nice feel. This 3DCGI movie on the other hand doesn't really deliver any of that. It does have very successful 3D design and for once the CGI doesn't look too awkward either. Definitely a better pic for that matter than Space Pirate Captain Harlock or Final Fantasy Kinsglaive. As an adaptation, for person like me who is familiar with all of these source materials, I have to say Gantz doesn't work as a stand alone title at all. So others shouldn't bother and Gantz fans will be pleased to some extend at least? I am not sure about that either. This movie is the least mature take on the Gantz franchise for sure. Much like with Berserk Golden Age Arc movies (yes, not the new hideous series, but the movies) - this series seems now like a shonen title aimed for teens while it is originally meant to be mature content for adults. Other than few blood spats and Berserk sex scenes, you will not find much mature and brutal content in them. Some would agree those won't work with CGI well, so it is better not to even try.That leaves me to the question, who is the target audience for this title? I guess the fact that Netflix got it soon after release widely, implies how niche audience we are talking about. On the other hand, I would have never watched this movie if it hadn't been on Netflix recommendations. In the end, I will recommend this piece to everyone who enjoys cyberpunk."
" Warning: not for adults and/or the uninitiated
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,1,"I understand that 'Gantz' is some sort of video game or manga cartoon show or both, and for fans of whatever-it-is this movie might be something fun. But you definitely need a backstory because - for someone who's had no previous clue as to what this whole 'Gantz' might be (like me), and just gave it a watch because Netlix - this whole thing is just too ridiculous and too terrible to watch.The animation isn't good. It looks good in stills, but when things start moving the physics just feel off. The facial expressions are terrible. The action director isn't John Woo. In the opening scene some monster grabs a car (this looks weird, as the car seems to have no mass/inertia) and throws it at a lady. The car (in slo-mo) comes at her and is about to crush her, but then (not in slo-mo and way too fast to see what's happening) a fellow on some sort of motorbike-like machine intervenes to save her, but he bounces the car away like it's a balloon instead of a massive car. (So physics again way off.) I'm sure this intervention is supposed to look cool and heroic, but because of the poor use of slo-mo and terrible physics, it just looks weird and is anti-climactic.(Also, this whole time the viewer who has no foreknowledge of this video game/cartoon show doesn't know what's going on. The puppets say things which I'm sure makes some kind of sense to the initiated, but to the uninitiated it was just silly.) Then some other stuff happens which also sucks. A guy with unnatural facial expressions and body movements is stabbed and dies, but comes back to life to discover he is now in a video game of some sorts. The viewer is supposed to accept this without any backstory and/or explanation as to why, who, what and where - my guess is because the movie is made for people who already played this game. (So don't bother if you haven't, I reckon.)Also the suits and the guns. They don't look cool. The suit looks cool on the lady, but for the men they're just too effeminate. Some guys from Osaka were supposed to look masculine and tough and definitely of the heterosexual persuasion, but because of the tight ladysuits and flaming snowboots they're wearing they simply don't. So when they start to sexually harass the lady at the first sight of her, it just feels ridiculous, like they're overcompensating. And the guns don't visibly shoot anything, plus it takes a while for the target to be affected by being hit, so it basically looks like they're shining an awkward blue flashlight at the monsters without much happening. Visually very unsatisfying. Anyway, this is when I switched it off, about 15 to 20 minutes in. Don't bother if you're not a fan of this cartoongame already."
" Great movie, laughable dialogue.
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,7,"Most animé have great great combat scenes, maybe even great visuals due to excellent CGI and maybe some great scenes and story flow... but what is usually lacking is the dialogue, which tends to be lazy and feels like an after-thought. Gantz:0 had the potential to be an excellent movie, but just like other animé with amazing CGI - it fell flat, over and rolled over into laughing zone. One of the girls just sounds like a mental basket - not sure what they were trying to accomplish with her character.Overall I liked it... definitely not the best, but the animation alone, combat scenes, story-boarding was excellent."
" Amazing Visuals but worst writing I've ever seen
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,6,"Seriously, the visuals were incredible. 10/10. The monsters in it were the perfect level of disturbing and fantasy. The movements fluid, But the dialog, my god the dialog. If they said literally anything other than the things they said I would have enjoyed it 100x better. They could have just shouted random names of fruit and I would have cringed a lot less."
" Good Looking, Action Packed and Utter Nonsense
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,3,"It's enjoyable if you like over the top action and explosive awesomeness, but man is it a big bag of stupid in between. So much so that even though it is some of the best CGI work to date I can't bring myself to give it more than I did. Most of the dialogue is just borderline abominable and made some parts of this movie really hard to watch. The writing is one big incoherent mess chock-full of anime clichés. Superfans will most likely eat it up and praise it to high heavens, so if you're not that much in to anime steer clear of this one and maybe watch some of the fight scenes on Youtube or something.Best bit: The little old manster Worst part: Any interaction between Kato and Anzu."
" Impressive animation and a rather good adaptation overall
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,8,"This is one of the best manga adaptation I've seen, right after Akira and Ghost in the Shell (Mamoru Oshii's version). Well, that might be a bold statement since Gantz: O doesn't have the depth of these two, but it's a rather good adaptation of a segment of Hiroya Oku's manga, quite entertaining, and very, very well made. The motion capture is impressive, the best I've seen so far in this kind of production and leaves far behind the various declensions of Final Fantasy, Halo, or resident Evil (the animated ones). It's so good that I often had the impression to be watching live actors. The facial expressions are perfect, down to the glittering eyes that gives these animated characters the sparkle of life that's often missing in Asian CGI animation. No doubt this movie will be a reference for future productions of that type. Otherwise, just an advice, don't look away or be distracted in the five last minutes or you might be baffled by what's going on (I had to watch the end twice because someone talked to me at the worst moment and I missed the one sentence that was the key to it all)."
" Amazing, a must for anime and Gantz fans
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,10,"Everything fits in this movie, they didn't overreached trying to tell the whole history, the whole manga; they just put a saga and run with it, telling the mechanics of the game on the run. They just missed one minor character from the manga in the Osaka saga, but it's amazing how they give even the minor characters a texture and weight, so you could understand their motives even if you didn't read the manga."
