" 1000 euro bonus vs the job of your coworker
",2021-04-08 00:00:00,7,Marion Cotillard plays so well in this movie. Very simple movie but very well played with low tones.The movie deals with two themes1. Ethical. Do you prefer a bonus 1000 euro instead of your coworker to keep hers job?What you will do in a such dilemma ?Do you vote for the bonus?2. The psychology of a person that is recovering from depression. The feeling of low self esteem. The feeling of worthlessness. The despair that multiplies in the mind with the first difficulty. The difficulty and shame to ask from someone to not take a bonus 1000 euro and vote for you to keep your position.
" REALITY IS HARD.
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,8,The story is simple but has reality. Most of her co-workers need money to live. I kept thinking what I would do if I were in their situation. And the last scene was really good. This movie is simple but well focus on ordinary person who challenge the wrongness.
" Epic
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,8,"Sandra a woman worker at Sowal corporation is on medical leave for depression and when she is returning to work she is learning that her boss has held a voting poll among her co-workers to decide if they were or not in favour of her dismissal. If they would they would receive a bonus prize of 1.000 euros each . The voting was in favour of her dismissal. She and her friend Julietta convinced their boss on a Friday to repeat the voting on the following Monday. Then Sandra starts an epic struggle wihj the help of his encouraging husband to contact her co-workers who had voted for her dismissal in this first voting poll to revert their votes now in her favour. She tried to contact one by one and she got various different reactions, some of them agreeing to do it and some others not because of course 1000 euros was an amount they very much needed. And this sometimes caused even domestic conflicts at home of some of those contacted. All the acting performers do an excellent job with a special mention of Marion Cotillard as Sandra. A movie that keeps you very interested from beginning till the end."
" Beautful
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,8,"Chanced upon this great movie ""Deux jours, une nuit "" and it shows that life is not that easy. We may have to make some difficult choices. But what is your priority while making those choices? The ending of the movie establishes this beautifully. It shows what empathy is, integrity is, humanity is, GOD is."
" Marion Cotillard is at her best
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,9,"'Two Days, One Night' is as low key and quiet as a film can get - A realistic human story of the basic struggle to make ends meet in this world. The movie becomes a fascinating social study of human behavior and how people respond when faced with a question of morals that would benefit someone else instead of just themselves. It features the finest performance of the great Marion Cotillard. Cotillard skillfully underplays, avoiding the overemotional, showy theatrics that often plague such dramas. The result is a stunning, vivid, important film filled with subtext and offering plenty of fodder for both thought and conversation that ranks among the Dardennes' best."
" Deux jours, une nuit Review
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,7,"Marion Cotillard gives a great performance in a film with a very realistic tone, we see basically everything the main character is doing, the thype of cinema that is mostly seen in France, but in the case of this film, because you see the main character ask the same thing repetitive times and even knowing what she can lose you don't exactly know the real problem, until doesn't actually matter anymore, but even with making you care about the character who is suffering from depression and taking a lot of pills, the film can became a little boring.Like other film from the Dardenne brother's that i saw it, La fille inconnue, that was made after this one, it also shows the main character in basically every frame, the supporting characters has it purposes and the relationship between her husband is explored very well, he is there supporting her in everything but he also cant do everything for her in this particular case, and they do that without exposition scenes like him have a emotional dialogue to promote the actor or the movie, and this is good because is more realistic, we know that he is doing everything he can, and his character probably already told her what would have been that emocional scene that others filmmakers would wanna putting in the film, but here is not necessary, you learn that from the way he is dealing with the situation. All that said, in the end even realizing that this film was better told, i found the other one that i mentioned more intriguing, making more interesting as i watched."
" Magnificent Marion!
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,8,"Marion Cotillard has reflected so many various emotions like weakness, sadness, anxiety, instability and happiness easily and perfectly.
Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne have put her in a difficult situation with their choice about taking most of the scenes with long take and she passed this perfectly.
She has reached the perfectionism in this movie. Come on she have even acted with her BREATH!Life can not have win-win situations, this philosophy was represented ably by Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne cinematic tools in such a great story that shows our main character struggles to make people vote for her job against 14 person who have their own reasons to vote for dismissing her and get 1,000 EUR as a reward.
The ingenuity of the script is that we can not say that people who will vote for the reward that they're greedy or selfish. Absolutely no, they literally fight for their survival in the life.Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne have succeed in choosing their directing tools.
Like they have succeed in delivering a lot of emotions without an important dramatic tool like the music and they replaced it with the background noises and that added more realism to the scenes.
Also the shaky camera had a message that the characters have instability."
" same scene, 100 times
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,4,"Critics enamoured with Cotillard gave this 5*. Really? It's heart is in the right place, and you do feel for the lead. But essentially as a film it's the same scene 12 times and then an unsatisfactory conclusion."
" Good, though only thanks to Marion Cotillard's excellent performance
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,8,"Definitely good, though only thanks to Marion Cotillard's excellent performance.The premise is intriguing and features some emotional scenes, there's one with Timur (Timur Magomedgadzhiev) that particularly hit me in the feels out of nowhere; it's not even the most gut-wrenching part of the film, yet it made me feel something the most.The camera work et al. isn't all that great, the dialogue is especially underwhelming. Perhaps I was noticing it more due to viewing with subtitles, but there's a lot of moments where we see Sandra (Cotillard) retrace the same steps with each individual - it gets repetitive.Cotillard, though, is top notch. She brings so much emotion and realness with her, nailing every single scene to deserve notable props. Away from the Parisian, there aren't any others to note; they are all fine but I would've loved a more meaty cast.I'd be rating it a level lower if it wasn't for the lead, who is easily the best thing to come out of 'Two Days, One Night'."
" The Lost Weekend
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,8,"An apt companion piece to Philip Leacock's 'The Rabbit Trap' over half a century earlier; which like the earlier film has an ending which probably deliberately poses more questions than it can possibly answer.Marion Cotillard has the same sad eyes that recall Sylvia Sidney suffering similar trials during the thirties; while David Thomson describing Vera Miles in 'The Wrong Man' hit the nail on the head when he wrote that her break up ""shows how seldom one has seen untheatrical distress. She turns plain and inept""."
" Grabbed my attention whilst burning the midnight oil
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,8,"I stumbled across this movie this evening whilst suffering with insomnia.Two Days, One night is a story of a woman's desperate attempts to persuade her co-workers into making a very important decision that determines her future. The story focuses on human nature and our ability to give something up for someone we barely know. It is intimate and human throughout and there were times where the emotions were very raw.The plot is simple and there is a sense of unpredictability and tension as the story unfolds.The acting was excellent.I thoroughly enjoyed Two Days, One Night because it tells a human interest story that could happen to anyone. It was involving, emotionally raw, and just very human."
" Excruciatingly Honest!
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,8,"This gritty slice of social realism works both as an exploration of human nature --how essentially egoistic it is but also capable of altruism-- and as a character study of a person on the verge of another nervous breakdown while facing a dilemma. This is also a showcase of Marion Cotillard's undisputed acting prowess. It's great that I share the same birthday date with her :) The Dardenne brothers' use of wide, long shot and handheld camera is simply outstanding. They further add up to the honest and realistic sense of the film. That said, I couldn't help feeling that there's some kind of familiarity because of how schematic the plot seems to be.(8/10)"
" One of the best movies to understand capitalism
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,10,"Amazing performance by Marion Cotillard, great text and direction, essential movie on capitalism (working class, capitalists and their cowardice, lack of solidarity...) and depression."
" Do your best!
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,9,"Life bruises the unfortunate a lot, often intensifying when you're already at the abyss. The reaction to the tribulations shown here (amazingly portrayed by the lead) feels extremely genuine as most sane folks would contemplate desperate measures as well as fight back intermittently. It's rarely just one of the two responses. Just a fine film oozing with everything human: the good, the average and the ugly."
" Marion Cotillard is brilliant in this wonderful Dardenne brothers film
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,9,"Two Days, One Night (Deux Jours, Une Nuit) is a Belgian film written and directed by the fabulous Dardenne brothers. This the fifth movie I've seen by the Dardennes; each one is an understated masterpiece in my opinion. They quietly focus in on a person or situation and take you on a transformative journey with them.In this case, Marion Cotillard turns in an award winning performance as Sandra, a working class mother of two, who is recovering from a depression. Just as she's strong enough to go back to work, her co-worker, Juliette, tells her that the other employees voted to get a bonus of 1,000 Euro per person, which had been pitted against Sandra's job as an EITHER - OR in a show-of-hands vote. Sandra is vulnerable like a wobbly calf just getting it's balance and strength back after an illness, and this hits her hard.Her husband convinces her to fight for her position, so Sandra spends a weekend, (Two days, One Night), going round to each of her fourteen co-workers and asking them to vote to keep her job in a re-vote on Monday, which would mean forgoing their bonuses. ""I'd rather be working with you than to be on the dole alone,"" she tells them.I was rapt by this art film, breathless to see how each person would respond. The premise is powerful; the unblemished, straightforward style, and the honest delivery by Marion Cotillard, (a new favorite actress), makes it feel like you are there with her in this wretched situation. Through the process (that has unexpected outcomes) she hits deep levels of shame and desperation, while proving to be a stronger person than imagined.This is excellent filmmaking!!"
" Chin Up
",2019-08-31 00:00:00,8,"The premise, simple. A woman tries to win back her job from her co-workers who voted against her returning in favor of a 1k bonus. The execution, nearly spectacular. Marion Cotillard carries the film into poignantly raw territories, with the film feeling like something you're viewing from the outside as a spectator. I'll watch anything Cotillard does, and this film earned her a second Oscar nomination a few years back. With this type of story, there are going to be winners and losers, as people are either losing money or a co-worker, a brilliantly thought provoking premise. But the audience is the real winner here. Watching Cotillard effortlessly (essentially) repeat the same scenes over and over as she visits her various co-workers around town, but yet still make every visit feel special and unique, that's the true sign of a world class actress.8.7/10"
" Great movie by Dardenne Brothers
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,9,"This movie was suggested by a Belgian friend & I really enjoyed it. Story of struggle, sacrifice, emotions. Great movie."
" I can see what they were aiming for
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,5,"The movie definitely had its good points. The acting was fine, and there was some sort of examination of the impact of mental illnesses, on both on the person suffering and their near families.
But the strength of the movie became its weakness. By focusing so much on the main character, there was almost no analysis of the doubtlessly complicated relationships of the other employees, either with each other or with their significant others. None of those who said no had anything more nuanced to say than that they needed the money.
And this is even before we get to the main premise of the movie. In France, which has some of the most employee friendly regulations in the world, telling someone second hand that they're losing their job would be enough to land you in court, even if the reason for the sacking wasn't mental illness, which on its own is probably illegal."
" A brilliant screenplay by the Dardenne brothers with many great mini-stories
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,9,"In an industrial town in Belgium, Sandra (Marion Cotillard) is a factory worker recovering from depression. Her situation is worsened when she discovers that she is likely to lose her job unless she can convince a majority of her co-workers (sixteen in total) to give up their annual bonuses. She has the time period of the film's title to do this. The film is written and directed by Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne.This film is made on a small budget and is minimalist. Despite this, it has the same impact of a big-budget thriller as Sandra's situation (the fear of losing a badly needed job) could be a situation in most people's lives: perhaps ourselves or someone we know and care for - whether this situation be in the past, present, or in a projected and worrisome future.The nastiness of the modern economy is well reflected in higher management making a decision that turns co-workers against each other as they face moral dilemmas.Cotillard, who was superb in ""La Vie en Rose"" (2007), does a wonderful job in the lead role. In her many scenes of knocking on doors and ringing buzzers, she perfectly displays apprehension and humiliation as she waits in fear and uncertainty for the reply she might get. It is easy for the viewer to get inside her head as she conveys difficult feelings even in a quiet way.The best achievement in this film is in its screenplay. We see most, though not all, of Sandra's meetings with her co-workers. Within each of those encounters, we see small stories that are all unique and rich in their own way even if they take place only in a few minutes. This is also due to great actors playing the roles.""Two Days, One Night"" is very humanistic. There is much lingering after the conclusion wondering the fate of the characters as well as the true motives of Sandra's supportive husband who pushed her into the pursuit. One of the best movies of the 2014.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Screenplay by Jean-Paul and Luc Dardenne"
" Cotillard great. Movie not so.
",2018-10-26 00:00:00,5,"Marion Cotillard is one of the best French actresses around today. She acts superbly well in this movie. The movie however is quite repetitive in the fact she basically spends the whole movie visiting her co workers to get them to change their mind over her keeping her job rather than them keeping their 1000 Euro Bonus. Thats it, nothing more , nothing less."

" Two Days, One Night
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,7,"Sandra has been off work with depression and just as she feels she is ready to return she learns has been made redundant. It emerges that while she was away her fellow workers slightly increased their work time to cover for her than, at the suggestion her boss and supervisor they held a ballot to decide whether to each get a 1000 Euro bonus and let Sandra go or to let her return. Under pressure from the supervisor most voted to let her go. A friend tells her that the ballot is to be re-run in two days so she sets off to persuade enough of her colleagues to change their minds. Each has their reason for voting to let her go and most need the money; some are persuaded, some apologise but explain that they can't afford to back her and one or two actually get violent accusing her of trying to 'steal' their bonus. As the end approaches it is clear that the vote will be very close; will Sandra get the numbers she needs or will she fall short?When I started watching this I knew nothing about it beyond the fact that it starred Marion Cotillard and was Belgian as it was a last minute replacement for a previously advertised TV programme. This lack of knowledge did make it a little hard to get into but as the film progressed I started to sympathise with Sandra's plight. As we meet her colleagues it is also easy to sympathise with most of them too; they need the extra pay if not quite as much as she needs her job. The more people she visited the more it looked as if she stands a chance of success to by the end there is a feeling of tension when the vote takes place. The cast does a solid job, especially Marion Cotillard who is rarely off screen as Sandra and really makes the viewer feel for her character. There are a few details that seem unlikely; I don't know about Belgian labour laws but it seems unreasonably that a workforce could be given a vote on whether they want a bonus or to let a colleague on sick leave return to work. Sandra also makes a remarkable recovery following a 'medical issue'. Overall though this is worth watching if you want a character driven drama without lots of action. I suspect I would have enjoyed it more if I'd known a little more about it before I started watching.These comments are based on watching the film in French with English subtitles."
" The real hell of life is everyone has his reasons...
",2017-12-22 00:00:00,9,"""Two Days, One Night"" takes place in a small Belgian town, but take it from someone who's been living in the North of France, the grass isn't greener out there and the sky is pretty gray too. This is a part of Europe that used to be the industrial heart and that is now plagued by unemployment and professional precariousness. Everyone tries to keep his job, work extra hours or under the table to make ends meet.It is a real Darwinian system where one's ability to survive is guided by the will to work in the toughest conditions and to surrender to any liberal diktat, if it means being able to provide a shelter and a modest living for a family. It's not the happiest place or mindset of the world, but I know it enough to tell you that a vast majority earn money in non-declared activities or go as far as having large families for child benefits. As always, private decisions depend entirely on economical matters, and if money can't buy love or happiness, itit surely one tangible factor.It is important to contextualize the film geographically because we've got to realize that a bonus of 1000 euros isn't something to take lightly. People live with one salary sometimes and the minimum wage isn't far from that amount of money, it means a lot when you live in poverty. Secondly, we've got to perceive Sandra, the protagonist and heroine-to-be of quite a harrowing journey as a person at the bottom of that Darwinian scale. She's a worker in a solar-panel factory, in a town with one of the highest unemployment rates, and she's just recovered from a depression, which makes her slightly more vulnerable than her co-workers... if not already seen as a liability. The film puts us immediately in Sandra's situations, she learns from a friend that a vote has been cast in the factory and in order to compensate for some financial losses, the workers agreed to have Sandra fired and earn a bonus of 1000 euros. Sandra's friend manages to convince their boss to cast the vote again on Monday, and if a majority throw away the prime, Sandra stays. Sandra has basically one weekend, two days, one night literally, to convince her co-workers to vote for her, which means renouncing to a large sum of money so she could keep her job. We don't have time to discuss the process, there's urgency and then one of the most gripping journey to the ends of the economical chain takes off.The plot looks almost like a reality TV show with a frail woman being literally sacrificed at the altar of liberalism, with the bosses washing their hands of it. But the Dardennes brothers stay in ""harmony"" with the bleakness of the situation and don't try to make a crusader or some Messianic heroine out of Sandra, Sandra is at the edge of a nervous breakdown, many moments she's about to crack up, and in her first encounters, she's literally begging for a vote in her favor. She never sounds or feels like a heroine because, with maybe a few exceptions, none of the co-workers is portrayed as a villain or someone motivated by greed or selfishness. It's less the money they jeopardize than the prospects, children, house, plans and so on.The movie reminded me of that wonderful quote from Jean Renoir's masterpiece ""The Rules of the Game"" (quite a fitting title), when Renoir's character Octave says: ""The real hell of life is everyone has his reasons"", and they do have reasons and good reasons. Some react in an aggressive way but generally speaking, violence has an interesting counter-effect in the film, some break down and realize that they've been acting wrongly, other asks questions like ""who voted for you so far?"" ""who's ready to give up the prime?"", and it's very telling about the gregarious instinct, even in order to make a decent or good action, they have to know where the others stand for, exactly like in ""12 Angry Men"" when the jurors only grasp the gravity of the situation when they start thinking as individuals, outside the group's zone of comfort.And the film does work like ""12 Angry Men"" with the evolution of Sandra. In the beginning, she always revealed who voted for her but after a few encounters, she explains that the vote is secret. She gained more confidence and cared for the rules and was less begging for her future than asking people to reconsider the validity of their choices. Gradually, we see Sandra's overpowering her own insecurity, going through different stages, grief, anger, desperation, resignation, but with encouragements from her husband (FabrizioRognone) her faith in human nature increases and allows her to go further than she ever thought she could go. Marion Cotillard gives a magnificent, rightfully Oscar-nominated, performance like a French ""Norma Rae"".This is a film directed in all simplicity, with long takes for the the different encounters, not for artistic license but to capture the urgency and intensity of the moment, and the suspense lying on the ""final answer"". And each encounter provides one layer of complexity in a rather complex subject, and leading up to a splendid finale. As the plot advanced (it's one hour and half but it felt like a sprint) I was wondering what could be the best ending? Getting the job? The fanfare triumph? The downer ending? The wonderful script finds the perfect conclusion, sad, happy, uplifting and insightful.""Two Days, One Night"" says more than any economical essay about the consequences of crisis and unemployment, through realistic portraits of lives being weakened and threatened by the economical game, and a film that makes you think of ""12 Angry Men"", ""Norma Rae"" or ""The Rules of the Game"" could never fail."
" Very dull indeed
",2017-09-06 00:00:00,4,"The subject matter of the Dardenne's ""Two Days, One Night"" is unusual, to say the least, for a mainstream movie in this day and age, (though perhaps not for the Dardenne's who have made their name from squeezing the 'drama' out of dramatic material). It's about industrial relations, or rather it's about one woman fighting to keep her job, concentrating to a large degree on her psychological state over the short period of the film and there's no denying that Marion Cotillard is very good in the part and yet I never felt involved. In truth, nothing very much happens; Marion spends her time going round her co-workers asking each of them in turn to vote for her in a secret ballot. After a time this gets very dull indeed. It's certainly an intelligent film and it's nicely done but over this, give me the hysteria and the melodrama of ""Norma Rae"" any day."
" Two Days, One Night
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,7,"I mainly found out about this Belgian-French-Italian film because of the leading actress being nominated during awards season, I had no idea what it was about, I was just hoping for something worthwhile, directed by brothers Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne (Rosetta, The Kid with a Bike). Basically in the industrial town of Seraing, near Liège, Belgium, Sandra Bya (Oscar nominated Marion Cotillard) is a young wife and mother to two children, she works for Solwal, a small solar- panel factory. After suffering a nervous breakdown, Sandra has been forced to take time off from her job, on medical leave for depression. During Sandra's absence, shop foreman and her immediate supervisor Jean- Marc (Olivier Gourmet) suggests to the boss, M. Dumont (Batiste Sornin), that her section of the company can function with sixteen people working full time with a bit of overtime. The management proposes a 1,000 bonus to all staff if they agree to make Sandra redundant, near the end of her medical leave she returns to work and discovers that her fate rests in the hands of her sixteen co-workers. Sandra's friend and co-worker Juliette (Catherine Salée) learns a ""show of hands"" vote was held, the result a 13-3 decision for the bonuses over Sandra's job, Juliette knows Jean-Marc is determined to get rid of Sandra. The vote was influenced by scare mongering through misinformation, but Juliette and Sandra at the end of the Friday working day are to convince Dumont to hold another secret ballot on Monday morning. Sandra needs a majority to keep her job, meaning nine votes, by Saturday morning, Sandra's supportive husband Manu (Fabrizio Rongione) convinces her that over the weekend she should speak to all thirteen of her colleagues who voted for the bonuses to get them to change their minds. They not only need the income from Sandra's job, but Manu believes the job is a symbol for Sandra, to prove her own self worth and for her mental state. Sandra reluctantly goes about this task, visiting and finding her colleagues one by one, most of the co-workers however need the proposed bonus for their own families. Finally it comes to Monday morning, the factory workers have a second ballot, but the vote is tied, with eight votes to keep the bonus and eight for Sandra to leave, as a result, Sandra will lose her position. However, the factory manager calls Sandra into his office, he agrees to give her a job, but in the end, she decides to turn it down, Sandra has found the emotional strength to deal with the situation and the confidence to start anew, to pursue a new life for herself. Also starring Pili Groyne as Estelle, Simon Caudry as Maxime, Alain Eloy as Willy, Myriem Akheddiou as Mireille, Fabienne Sciascia as Nadine and Timur Magomedgadzhiev as Timur. I can see why Cotillard was nominated the Oscar, she gives it her all as the ordinary working-class woman coming out of depression now on the edge trying to keep her job, it is a fairly simple humanistic story, the majority of which is just the leading character knocking on doors and talking to her co-workers about whether they will change their mind or not, but it is interesting enough to keep you hooked until the end, a worthwhile drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language. Very good!"
" Weak screenplay
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,6,"Given the premise of this story I think most people could come up with a script to equal or surpass the one in this movie. The premise has a boss of seventeen blue-collar employees present them with the decision to forgo their bonuses in favor of not laying off a particular woman. That woman is Sandra (Marion Cotillard) whom we get to know throughout the movie. Sandra is recovering from an episode of depression and is just coming back to work, only to find out about the vote where the majority of employees voted to keep their bonuses. That would send most any person into a depression, so Sandra is indeed in a tough situation, given her already delicate emotional state. Also, she has a husband and two young children and losing her job would have a devastating effect on the family. Feeling that her foreman had biased the vote by telling people that even if Sandra were saved, someone else would be fired, Sandra appeals to the big boss for a re-vote, and that is granted. From there the movie slips into low gear as Sandra tracks down her fellow employees and tries to convince them to vote in her favor. One after another we see her finding out where her colleagues live and going to their homes. She is seen, in *long* takes, walking, riding the bus, and being driven by her husband to the homes. What develops is pretty predictable. Some workers are swayed and some just feel that, given their situation, they cannot give up the bonuses they had worked for. We see how lower middle class people have a hard time of it and how varied their situations are.I guess that there are some bosses dumb enough to set up a situation like the one portrayed here. The way these decisions are usually handled is to make the proposition of forfeiting bonuses, or raises, in favor of keeping all the staff on board, rather than signaling out a specific employee. Some things did point to why Sandra might have been singled out though. She had been on sick leave for depression with her ability to function in question, and the remaining employees could take up the slack in her absence. I got the feeling that Sandra was not particularly well liked and was surprised by how little she knew about her fellow employees, particularly given there were only sixteen others for her to know. It's not surprising that this situation produced a lot of strong emotional reactions--jobs and money strike at the heart of people's lives.I like Marion Cotillard and feel she was good in this difficult role. Given that she is portraying a woman recovering from depression she has few highly dramatic scenes, so to appreciate her performance you have to key on her subtle reactions. The movie illustrates the difficulty in dealing with a depressed person and I vacillated between being irritated with Sandra's husband and his apparent insensitivity by goading his wife into painful situations that could easily send her back into full-scale depression. But then I had to realize what a delicate situation he was dealing with and moderated my opinion. Getting through this was a bit of a slog. I found my attention had to be restrained from wandering."
" Rising Above Her Circumstances
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,10,"Rising above her circumstances Marion Cotillard's role as Sandra is set in the everyday mundane world of her neighbors and workplace. The highs and lows of confronting her co workers is a journey which contains a depth of dynamics not immediately obvious in the first five minutes. However, this belies the character depth revealed through this arduous process where humility leads to greater things."
" ""two days, one night"" of one Helluva Weekend for Marion Cotillard
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,8,"Before seeing the French domestic drama ""two days, one night"" I was only cursorily familiar with Marion Cotillard's work. I am now richly informed.Likewise, little did I know that a movie about a blue collar wife and mother battling to keep her job as a rank and file factory floor worker could be enrapturing entertainment. Guess what? It can.Cotillard is completely credible in this Oscar-nominated performance as Sandra. She strikes nary a false note in a riveting turn as a woman struggling with severe depression as she strives to convince fellow employees to ditch their coveted bonuses so that she may continue to earn a living for her family and not be forced to take government handouts ""on the dole"". The fact that Cotillard, though a true natural beauty, went without any apparent make up for the bulk of the film only served to enhance the stark urgency and utter desperation inherent in her enormously daunting mission.And there is another aspect of ""two days, one night"" that especially appealed to me personally. As a big rock music fan, I found it delightful that the Belgian Director tandem of brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne chose to include in their production a pair of scenes which cleverly communicate the inherent spirit and emotion of the genre in very different manners. The pair of classic songs featured from legendary pop and rock icons Petula Clark and Van Morrison instill a sense both of pathos and frivolity into the complex fabric of this chronicle examining the fight for human dignity and destiny.Never one to surrender the specifics as regards an ending, I will simply impart that ""two days, one night"" arrived at a conclusion that is at once as reasonably realistic as it is distinctly hopeful.Or to put it another way......Success and satisfaction do not always come to us in the forms in which they are pursued."
" Solidarity
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"Imagine trying to recover from depression only to discover that your illness was in danger of costing you your job; or worse, that in your absence your boss had asked your colleagues to vote for retaining you, or receiving their annual bonus. Imagine then having to visit those colleagues and beg them not to vote for you to lose your livelihood. This is the grim scenario for the Dardenne brothers' film 'Two Days, One Night', whose strength lies in the fact that nothing is presented in an overly melodramatic fashion: it's a simple, hard story of people doing what they have to do, as best as they are able. In a a way, it's also the film's weakness: in a moment of inner despair, the lead character overdoses, but it's so internalised that the incident is strangely quiet and unremarkable. But overall, the film is a telling exploration of the scope, and limits, of human solidarity; and the ending is a nice mixture of the positive and the realistic."
" A performance and a premise in search of just a little more
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,7,"This film is about the economics of the economy, the impact on its workers and the inhuman decisions one has to make to survive. It is also kind of an exploration about recovering from mental illness, but not completely. Ultimately its about overcoming.Other than its insane premise, unbelievable in its all too mundane believability, it is a mostly pat story arch told with ""realism"" and a splendid performance from Marion Cotillard and not much more. It feels like the premise was concocted first and the characters (and by extension the mental illness) and ending tacked on to make it workable."
