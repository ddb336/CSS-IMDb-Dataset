" Young professionals living in fancy SoHo apartments traverse love and relationships
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,6,"After 20 something Alice (Dakota Johnson) breaks her steady long-term relationship with her boyfriend (Nicholas Braun) to move to New York to learn how to be single. There she befriends other similar girls living the single life.A standard self-help BRIDGET JONES type of 'chick flick' with Rebel Wilson thrown into the mix to add more in the way of physical and adult comedy and provides the majority of the laughs.The Manhattan settings are glossy and it should come as no surprise that the film is based off a novel by Liz Tucillo who wrote many of the scripts for 'Sex and the City' as well as being the author of 'He's Just Not That Into You'. But as is typical of these films, as much as the characters are wanting to be single they of course find and traverse love. It does its best to avoid the influence of social media, but falls into the usual trap of young professionals living in fancy SoHo apartments. I'd love to know what their secret is!"
" Very cute and adorable...
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,9,"What a beautiful film, I found myself in several versions, the crazy and catchy Rebel, the independent and future mother of Leslie, Dakota and the kids from the apps and Alison, well, I think this one, despite being more straight and sensible I have very little, but yes, a cute movie about love relationships and their dilemmas... Very cute and adorable..."
" How to Be Single is over a half hour before it's over.
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,4,"Dakota Johnson has such a fresh, engaging, likeable screen presence that she single-handedly manages to sublimate the impulse to rip your cinema seat out of the floor and hurl it through the screen."
" ""He's Just Not That Into You,"" remade in a tacky way
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,5,"It has its moments, but isn't so endearing as the movie it copies."
" A film with heart
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,10,"This is a brilliantly uplifting film that's well worth a watch! It's full of heart and carries as much emotional depth as it does comedic moments. Don't listen to the negative reviews on here, if a light hearted comedy with a positive message is what you're looking for, this is the one for you!"
" Don't I lose myself now?
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,7,"My best friend send the URL of this to me at midnight suddenly, so I watched it till next morning. I cried a lot in the scene which Alice hugged Robin. It made me wanted to hug my friend like them.If I have some friend who warn me objectively and give me some chances to look back at myself, they're definitely precious for me. Don't I lose myself now?
To make yourself more ideal, it's not good to addicted to anyone as much as you lose yourself. If you're nice when you're alone, you must be more nice absolutely when you're with your partner.It's obvious to be comfortable when you're alone because you can live only in your rules. So free. It's too much hassle to match the others and compromise my opinion. But I prefer to make an effort against troubles each other than too easy life like I can do everything what I want. Because it's more constractive I think.
When I talked about this with one of my boy friends, he repeated ""constractive' and laughed scornfully. I was very serious though lol."
" It's a memory of a loved one
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,10,"The movie itself is good but this movie will always bring a whirlwind of emotions for me because I saw it with my aunt, who is no longer with us. She was like a mother to me, which is more than a mother to me because I do not know my biological mother. Anytime I ever see this movie, my aunt with always be with me. üôèüèΩ"
" General movies, you can pass the time
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,5,"Just like junk food, it has no nutritious taste but sometimes it's quite a craving."
" Hysterical
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,9,"So much fun! Hysterical lines. The last third was a bit slower, but fun anyway. I will definitely watch again. I have been recommending to friends all week."
" Cool movie
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,7,"Good choice when u chill, rebel funny as always, a really enojoyable movie"
" Everything you would expect
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,6,Everything you would expect. Not the best movie of the year but at least it was entertaining. Take it for what it is worth.
" Bad acting :(
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,3,"Made me sad... really disappointed me. I had high hopes.Dakota Johnson really needs to step up her acting game, it's really annoying to see her ""cheap"" acting... hurts to see her after knowing her grandma is Tippi Hedren.Would not recommend. Don't waste your time."
" Genuinely inspiring
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,10,"I watched this with my friend Viktoria and found it such an amazing movie. It inspired my friend to be strong, independent and it has helped her turn her life around. She was with a guy who treated her really badly and was able to break free And beat her depression. She now uses her new found confidence to inspire others. she is a real fighter. All because of this movie!She knows she can manage her life without a man, though has met a nice guy online. He is trying hard to impress her and make her laugh and she will soon pay him a compliment.So all in all the best movie ever in my opinion for the power it has!"
" YES YES YES A MUST WATCH for fun and a LAUGH!!!ü§£
",2019-12-24 00:00:00,10,"Simply just one word describes this movie for me...WOW!ü§£. It is worth the watch!!!! It isSO hilarious. And OMG who ever wrote the script is AMAZING!!!.
PLEASE WATCH don't listen to the haters or bad reviews, give it a try... Trust me it's worth it!"
" Worst
",2019-11-30 00:00:00,1,"If there is an option of 0 star i will give it to this movies direction, storyline. Fu*k it, how can anyone cheat like this. This type of films ruins our youngste, societ. It's clearly showing that how can you cheat on your bf/gf. üò°"
" Awful self-indulgent tripe
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,1,"Up there with 50000 Days Of Summer in the self-indulgence Olympics. Tropes living in an unattainable and unrealistic existence, the characters are intrinsically unlikeable and artificial. You can do better things with your life than watching this catastrophically mundane exercise in privileged self-absorption."
" Pointless
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,1,"JUST POINTLESS!
another movie for Dakota and all she does is pointless sex üòë"
" This movie is epic.
",2019-08-28 00:00:00,10,"I enjoyed every single thing of this movie. Every aspect of it is just unique, it doesn't really shows you any clich√©s or anything out of the ordinary. Just plain realities where not just woman, but men are also looking for that significant other. So, with the things that happens, you realize that no matter, if is drama or a romantic comedy, is actually a pretty good movie to watch. In the end there is a good message. (Just watch the movie and see for yourself) :3"
" Such a Fantastic Film
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,10,"How To Be Single is such a wonderful, hilarious movie! The cast made the movie even better in my opinion!!! There's love, heartache, tons of laughter throughout the movie, lessons learned and a wonderful outcome for the movie. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE ABOVE THE AGE 18. A++ Film"
" How to Be Single
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,5,5/10 - sometimes funny chick flick with a flawed plot and wasted potential
" Actively searching for yourself
",2019-07-09 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movie several times. This is an easy and romantic comedy.
Dakota Johnson is amazing in this movie. ""How to be single"" is her film, Alice is her character, and she showed well what she is capable of as an actress.
I really liked Rebel Wilson. She complemented the film, and her vulgar jokes were always funny.
The music in the film is perfectly matched. It complements the film and fits perfectly into it.
While watching you certainly pay attention to the beautiful views of New York. They make the film more romantic and show how big this city is.
The film shows that being alone is not bad, but rather even useful. However, of course you should not delay this moment and turn away from life during this period is not necessary, it is better to devote it to yourself, your desires and plans."
" Funny story
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,9,I love this movie! Always watch it to remind me of having a wonderful life while being single
" Clunky
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,6,"You've got to admire Dakota Johnson, she really is the best thing in this. The writing is bad, and I mean BAD! I cringed probably about 19 times. But Dakota actually turns crap into gold occasionally, she is such a great leading lady and acts everyone else off the screen.The biggest gripe? Damon Wayans Jrs character goes from being such an exciting romantic leading guy to a jerk in about 10 seconds. It begs the question, why did they even bother with that storyline to begin with??Rebel Wilson who I usually enjoy, is just plain obnoxious in this with zero layers.There's some enjoyment to be had from this little piece of trash, it wasn't as bad as some ensembles (I'm looking at you What to Expect When You're Expecting!!)"
" A DISAPPOINTING FILM WITH HARDLY ANY LAUGHS
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,4,"After getting this picture from the library, I thought it would be at least decent, it has three amazing actresses, Rebel Wilson, Leslie Mann from This is 40 and George of The Jungle, it also has Dakota Johnson. So I thought this movie was going to be blast and a load of good fun. It didn't have any laughs and Trainwreck is a hundred percent better than this one. I don't understand what made the cast decide to do a mediocre comedy film. I wonder what they were thinking when they first got the movie script. They should've done another movie, because this one starts out okay and ends nowhere. Boring with no laughs. The only reason I'm giving this movie a 4 out of 10 rating, is because the beginning was at least decent, and there's only one funny part in the movie. Skip this one, the filmmakers need to learn their lesson from this garbage."
" It's realy about life, love and happiness
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,10,"I think it's a good movie. We are preoccupied looking for the right person so we ignore our other needs, the need to reach for our dreams, the need to achieve what we promised ourselves a long time ago, the need to walk alone... Only then, we can recognize who we are, and whom we need in our life. It's is not about wild parties and sex - these things are part of everyone's youth. It's about how happiness is not something that someone else can bring us, but something that we have to find... allone."
" Funny!!
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,9,"I really liked this film. Rebel Wilson makes the film in my opinion. I love the hidden meaning that you don't have to be with someone to be happy or to be ""You"". The film didn't end with a soppy happy ever after with a couple getting married like I predicted. It ends with someone realising that being single is a gift and should not be taken for granted."
" Nothing But Cliches
",2019-02-21 00:00:00,1,"The characters are so fake. The fat girl's jokes are so lame. They try to give the impression of fatty but funny but so cheesy. Every aspect of movie is like a template. Lines, characters, clothes, pick-up lines etc."
" A poor romantic comedy
",2019-02-13 00:00:00,3,This movie is a poor comedy that even rebel Wilson was unable to save. The lead is poor and the script is your average comedy.
" I really liked it!
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,10,It's a very cute and funny movie :) It had the perfect combination of comedy and romance. Watch it if you're looking for an easy-going movie. It's a good movie to watch on a relaxing night.
" Annoying
",2018-11-29 00:00:00,2,"I honestly couldnt get past Dakota Johnson's lisp. Oh, and when she told her ex she was finally ready to be back with him. ""You don't wanth to be withhh meee?"" Ugh, so whiney and pathetic!! Oh yeah, and shes not funny. Rebel Wilson is funny."
" a hilarious look at single life
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this quasi romantic comedy because it shows you that there are times when being single is better than in a relationship or vice versa. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" BRILLIANT
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,10,"Haven't watched a Romcom in years and so glad I watched this! The fear of being alone is something that a lot of us can relate to even in this day and age where we're doing everything ""later"". Rebel was hilarious throughout and the moral behind this film was so powerful and thought-provoking. I am yet to master being alone without feeling lonely!"
" Honestly, my everything.
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,10,"How to be single is honestly one of my favorite movies ever! It's so freeing and weightless, I feel like it puts you in a good mood instantly. While, at the same time , teaching you some of life's most crucial wrongs and rights! I just adore this movies (and ofcours the actors) ‚ô•"
" Loads better than I expected
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,8,"I went in to this with zero expectations and actually found it laugh out loud funny. If you're a girl that's ever been single and lived away from home, honestly give it a go. It's relatable in its extremities and provides fun, likeable characters that you can attribute some (a lot) of your own or your friends characteristics to."
" Fun film
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,6,This is a fun film but I found the ending to be disappointing hence why I could only give it 6 stars.
" Pointless
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,1,"The movie has no purpose whatsoever, no redeeming qualities at all"
" Solid message
",2018-10-09 00:00:00,7,Not your typical romcom. This film actually explores what dating life is like for different people and has a pretty good message.
" I liked it! I really did.
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,7,"For a Monday evening after a long hard day, this was very easy chewing gum for the eyes tv. I mean even I know that the Manhattan apartment with three areas PLUS little balcony area complete with pretty pottted plants was nothing more than fantasy - but, I didn't take it seriously. It was just an hour and a half of easy escapism without having or wanting to think. Job done."
" I vote Yes
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,10,Loved it. It's romantic and funny and with very good actors. I watch about 5 to 10 movies per week.... I like this one very much. Do watch.
" Ok, Funny...
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,7,"This is a good and funny movie. I do not understand the bad reviews. some sayings in the movie are mega funny, so, just have a look."
" I watch it every Valentine's Day
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,8,"Okay so this movie isn't exactly revolutionary and the whole part with Damon Wayans could have been cut, but all of the women in it are sincerely charming and the relationships and friendships feel grounded and believable in a way that a lot of crazy romcom ones don't. I don't know why this wasn't a bigger hit since it's really pleasant and fun - maybe it should have been a Netflix original? It's a lot like Set It Up, but actually better and smarter! Single ladies, you will totally see yourself in this movie. This is the millennial sex and the city."
" great movie!
",2018-05-17 00:00:00,7,"It was typical scenario of romantic Comedy. But it does give other quite important message too. When I just saw the title, I thought it would be meaningless cliche movie, becuz the title is literally talking about how to be single. I just assumed that single just means that you are being alone without any boyfriend or girlfriend relationships. But in the movie, when Dakota Johnson finally realize what single truely meant, her life start to change. I would like to say this movie gives not only amusements of romantic comedy, but also get a thought about myself agonizing if I am a shell of human being like the main character."
" Fun, Flirty, Fabulous
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,8,"""How To Be Single"" is a self-help guide that's still figuring things out. It lacks intense introspection, and its attention is arguably distracted, as it's divided between the muddled storylines of various characters.
 That being said, ""HTBS,"" is an insanely fun film that should be on every romantic comedy fan's to-see list.
 If I had to file ""HTBS"" under a sub-genre, I would place it under something along the lines of ""girl power."" Although their romantic relationships are vital to the movie's central plot, it's ultimately Alice (Dakota Johnson), Robin (Rebel Wilson), and Meg's (Leslie Mann) relationships with each other that reign supreme, as can be seen in how Alice, the protagonist, ultimately ends up finding fulfillment within herself, rather than with any of her romantic conquests. It's similar to the likes of ""Sex and the City"" (2008) and ""Girls Trip"" (2017) in that the film's central plot revolves around the women's friendship, deeming their romantic lives as more of a fun side than the main focus.
 The soundtrack is effective in how it accentuates the mood, whether the scene be a sweaty night at the bar, hungover commute to work, or tender New Years Eve hike. Editing, such as counting the beers during the drinks scene between Alice and Tom (Anders Holm), helps to give the movie its modern feel.
 Johnson is surprisingly likable as Alice. Coming off of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" (2015) one might expect her performance to be rather bland, one-note even. However, Johnson is able to prove herself as a comedic actress. There are, undeniably some slow moments; one scene that sticks out is between Alice and David (Damon Wayans Jr.). Thanks to a flash-forward that feels out of place and unnecessary (there are no others like it in the film), their confrontation feels inappropriate. Since there's such a big jump in time, most of the exposition is forced into clunky dialogue, rather than the audience being shown the ultimate downfall of their relationship. Nevertheless, Johnson does her best to portray the months of emotional confusion that the audience is not shown.
 ""HTBS"" is also interesting in how it approaches hook-up culture through a feminist lens. Alice's reasoning for breaking up with her boyfriend (Josh, played by Nicholas Braun) is that she wants to experience the world fully, and does not feel like she can do so while remaining in her long-term college relationship. Alice is shown with multiple partners but is never slut-shamed. Balancing her personal life with her profession (which could've admittedly been touched on more), Alice portrays a modern woman who exudes independence through how she is constantly seeking it.
 Overall, ""HTBS"" is a fun film that doesn't take itself too seriously. While it does address some serious themes (ex. finding love after loss, unorthodox pregnancies/families), ""HTBS"" aims to be more of a fun, entertaining experience than intellectual stimulator, and should be celebrated for not attempting to pass as otherwise."
" Did it involve midgets?
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,7,"This is a near romantic comedy centering on Alice (Dakota Johnson) who has been cared for her whole life. She breaks up with her college boyfriend Josh (Nicholas Braun) so she can live on her own...with her sister Meg the doctor (Leslie Mann) and her best friend Robin (Rebel Wilson). Robin enjoys being single and leaving her mark all over NYC and gives Alice advice. Meg doesn't want children but delivers them for a living. She has no relationships. As a subplot there is bartender Tom (Anders Holm) and Lucy (Alison Brie) who hangs out in his bar for free Wi-Fi.Rebel brings to the screen her over-sexed outrageous personality that is always good for a laugh, if not shock value. Alice is our protagonist and is a bit on the mousey side, not being able to operate the menu on her remote. Apparently all the young single people in NYC hook-up with somebody different every night without any worry about consequences, making me feel like when I read a Playboy that the whole world is having an orgy except me.While the film had its moments and a feel good ending, it wasn't the formula romantic comedy as there was no ""Up Where We Belong"" moment.Guide: F-word. Implied sex. No nudity."
" Flip of the Coin.
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,3,"For me at least, it's not the cast, the acting, directing or the cinematography that makes this movie absurd... All of that is decent enough at different ranges respectively. No, what makes this movie a joke, is its story.Some chick decides to break something that isn't broken, and that decision isn't even at least based on a hunch, or unhappiness, or something real, rather it's based on a whim. That would've been fine though, had this film not then gone further and turned the person who's heart was initially broken (Josh) by a whimsical little girl turned skank (Alice), into the villain, with the movie now ending with him being the A-hole, loser and the one genuinely hurt, and she becomes the hero via sheer luck, coincidence and complete dumbassery.There are other things that this film got wrong, but at least Lucy not ending up with Tom wasn't one of them. Surprising actually that this movie had the EQ to get that right, not that getting something that simple right requires any kind of difficulty.The best character in this movie, though portrayed by an actor who's acting ability I've always questioned and will probably continue to do so forever, was undoubtedly, Ken.All romantic movies are about someone trying to find love, this movie was quite literally about someone trying to lose it, and was rewarded for it, and that, is insulting.The lesson on how to be single based on this movie is, unnecessarily throw away love on purpose, like a fart in the wind, and then hope (if even that) that it was the right call to make. Basically; How To Be Poor: Be rich, burn the money and hope it grows back on trees. 3/10."
" WORST MOVIE EVER
",2018-02-07 00:00:00,1,This movie is terrible.. it has some great actors but the storyline was a mess.. I never write reviews but this was SOO bad that I had to add this.
" Unplug you brain and have a little laugh
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,6,"To start this review, there are lot of things you can criticise about this film, here's a few.The over reliance on Rebel Wilson to provide all the comic moments in the film. When it ever gets remotely serious up she pops with some crazy line.Or whenever there is a remotely an opportunity to crack open a beer it will always be a Stella and it will always be opened with the label facing the screen!Or, the complete unrealistic pairing of the three main characters, would they ever truly be friends with a complete absence of any connection between the three of them (they don't bounce of each other at all and don't seem to care about each other), we've seen this odd couple malarkey again and again in romcoms. Further, when at the end of the film one of the three declares that one of the trio is her best friend it feels distinctly embarrassing and certainly not reciprocated.Negative comments aside, I certainly don't fit 15 year old girl target market for this film, but it's easy going, non taxing and I did enjoy it. There is an over reliance on Rebel Wilson, but she is funny, they do drink Stella but I can cope with that, and the friendship is not believable but I can ignore that. If you fancy something where you can unplug you brain and have a little laugh this is a good option."

" How to be non-specific...
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,5,"This is basically one of those holiday themed movies (New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day, etc... ) except that instead of being about a specific occasion, it's about the whole spectrum of not being in a relationship... It might as well be called ""The Single Experience""... The problem is, it tries so hard to cover all bases, that nothing it settles upon ever winds up really resonating (for me, at least).This is the number one problem I have with most ensemble movies - they're loose, shapeless, and unreliable... I wouldn't put up with those characteristics in a potential mate of mine, so why should I look past them, in a movie ABOUT the dating scene?!"
" ""Welcome to the party"" leave, leave now.
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,1,"Where to start, this film was sold as a romantic comedy via trailers etc, this could not be further from the truth. This film lacks in any real direction with the main characters who are all dreary, and some of the side stories are unnecessary and kill the option of deeper character developments, now there are some well established names on the script so I expected better!"
" A Good Movie with an Objective.
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,7,"I thought that this movie was going to be a ""how single people live"" kind of movie but, it gave out a lot more than I anticipated.This movie has a purpose and that purpose is to tell you that you are going to be great when you are all by yourself.It shows us how we do mistakes just because we want someone in our lives.We try to sculpt our lives according to them,we make a lot of comprises on our wishes just to get that one single person that you are going to spend your entire life with.Is it worth taking the risk? This movie specifically tells us that to find ""The One"" doesn't require you to give up on your dreams.Maybe, ""The One"" isn't actually what we are looking for at the first place."
" Ho Hum Average RomCom...5.5 Stars from me & that was pushing it!
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,5,"I was really looking forward to this movie after watching the trailer and I was thinking it was going to give me some good pointers on how to love being single. Instead, it gave me some raunchy, unadulterated and sloppy/poor advice. It was supposed to be a comedy though, so parts of it were quite funny. I guess the concept was all about 'who gives a rip, just live it up' mindset. I never saw the ladies at their job very often, so it seemed like even though they met at work, they didn't have much to do with the place. It was all about the social, party and the give it up to just anyone who will have you aspect. Not my thing! I wouldn't call it a waste of time, but I wouldn't watch it again. To each their own! Let it be!"
" Really, really horrible.
",2017-05-05 00:00:00,1,"There are no redeeming qualities in this movie. Although Leslie Mann and Rebel Wilson are great comedians, this movies writing cannot be saved by them.I imagine this movie was written by aliens who have never actually interacted with human beings before. They have perhaps on one occasion binge watched cougar town and the hang over movies because they were so depressed that their home galaxy had been swallowed by a black hole. Perhaps the aliens then proceeded to eat some junk food, to which they had a severe allergic reaction that caused them to have a minor stroke. Perhaps they then went to sleep, suffered from really very, very, disturbing dreams that they thought they needed to talk to someone about, and proceeded to write down the gist of it in their dream journals. Perhaps when they later read the content of their dream journal, they were gripped by the shallow, meaningless, indifference of the whole dream, and feeling very certain that if anyone should ever read said entry, they would deem them very shallow and dull. Perhaps that caused the aliens to feel sickened and threatened by their journals, and felt the only way to put that sorry part of their lives behind them was to throw it out of the lavatory feature of their hovercraft. Perhaps then it subsequently fell in the hands of some evil marketing exec's, who then decided to combine the content of the deranged alien dreamscape with things that go really well with focus groups consisting of people who have recently been freed from at least ten years of forced captivity. Or perhaps something even worse happened to make this movie exist in the world."
" The ending says it all...
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,8,"A quirky, light comedy showing different women wanting different things from relationships at different stages of their lives. It's not deep, it's not life changing, but as a female, I can relate to each and every female character, having had various expectations in relationships, and of myself, throughout my life. I found it funny and the ending perfect for the story."
" Barf. Fail.
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,1,"At this point I'm going to chuck it up to generational differences and reality because I'm in my 30s and I actually know what real life in NYC is like.As for generational differences, after watching several millenial-oriented movies, I'm going to assume that stupid and imagination-less crass crap is the new funny and that below average women are the new interesting women.As for reality, it reminds me that a paralegal can't afford a full apartment by herself in Manhattan, and that Manhattan night life eats extra large, crass women for breakfast.A horribly, pathetic, failed attempt at re-creating ""Sex and the City"" for boring millenial women everywhere, this movie is the type that makes very, very naive and, sadly, deluded young women from small towns move to NYC and post laughable craigslist ads such as ""Wanted: 1 bedroom apt. Max budget $500."" This type of movie is responsible for NYC's young homeless population. Stop making this stupid movie. Thanks!"
" Unfocused With Enough Laughs To Keep It Mildly Interesting
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,6,"Dakota Johnson stars in ""How To Be Single,"" playing a young woman on a break from her boyfriend as she starts a new life in NYC. She's on a quest to find herself, to have more adventures, to see what else is out there besides her ex and what he has to offer. With the help of a wild co-worker played by Rebel Wilson, Johnson gets what she wished for, and all the bad things that go with being single (creepy guys, closed off guys, the lack of true intimacy and connection, etc.).My most memorable, movie moment of ""How To Be Single"" is the scene when the new fianc√©e of one of the main characters is going psycho on the bartender character. It's one of the funniest scenes ‚Äî and the most creepy ‚Äî of the movie.Had this movie focused on just Johnson's and Wilson's characters, I think it would have been a better movie; but three more characters are given a lot of screen time (a bartender; a nutty online dater; and a doctor). Then there is the unnecessary scene at the end of the movie involving a minor character and his daughter that derails the focus off Johnson even more! With so many characters being juggled, it takes a laser focus and great talent of a screenwriter to make all this work¬Öand it doesn't, it doesn't work. Although there are some good laughs to be had throughout the movie, it's not enough to save this movie from the realm of mediocrity.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
" fun...good for some laughs
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,8,"Fast paced, well written, witty, hip, mostly unpredictable and hysterical at times... A surprisingly funny and show stealing performance from Rebel Wilson. Leslie Mann is always good and Dakota Johnson played a very good straight man to all the funny scenes. Mindless fun, good for more than a few laughs...I highly recommend for all ""smart comedy"" lovers out there! Peace-"
" Not a movie I would usually watch but glad I did.
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,8,"As suggested above, this isn't the kind of movie that I would watch but, after watching Dakota Johnson In several films and enjoying her work, I thought I would give it a go and I am definitely glad I did. To begin with, the plot line is brilliant showing the stories of several women and how they change emotionally and physically in some cases through the movie. These characters all have their own story arcs, their own personalities and their own ways of dealing with things which creates an interesting interaction when they run into each other. The actresses and actors that play some of the main characters are perfect, playing their roles to their full potential making them lovable and just downright hilarious. The film itself also has some interesting life lessons and things to live by throughout. The film is indeed funny and light hearted and I much recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh."
" Coming of age drama with moments of sweetness among moments of trashiness
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,6,"Christian Ditter, director of Love, Rosie, which, I have to add, I thoroughly enjoyed, gives us a not so romantic or comic film on How To Be Single, tackling how messy adulthood and relationships can be. (And what is it with rooftops Ditter?) Having quite a strong cast of characters it's central to Alice, having come away from a serious relationship to spread her wings in the Big Apple. It seems she's not sure what she actually wants and goes to and fro between wanted to be free and single to being lonely and needing that self gratification of being loved and wanted. The other characters such as her brooding sister nurse and her outrageous and liberating colleague and friend offer opposing ends of a spectrum, this coupled with some other characters that flit in and out of the story lines, such as Alison Brie's desperate yet conscientious Lucy. Relating to my own singledom, it's actually very one sided and seems little is drawn from single people's experiences and more so of people struggling with a life of solitude. It comes quite close to missing the point entirely, only to be given some deep and meaningful revelation at the conclusion. There's some hilarious moments, like the sauna scene but then other parts seem to just attempt to be funny, though well scripted and actually very well shot, it's unfortunately predictable and feels like it's on constant fast forward. Dakota Johnson took the lead as Alice, after Lily Collins dropped out and does a fine job portraying the beautiful yet bashful noob to being free and available. Leslie Mann plays her sister, but is pretty much the same character she has always played. Though very much from the female perspective, the two key male characters are actually highly entertaining, and again offer extreme stereotypes of either end of a spectrum. Anders Holm's brutally honest barman/player extraordinaire and Jake Lacy's down to earth and highly likable receptionist. The star is definitely Rebel Wilson. She gets the best lines, and this is so her. She's like the devil incarnate and is the true highlight of the movie. Fil Eisler deserves a mention too, his score is suits the film and sets the mood perfectly. It's a coming of age drama with moments of sweetness among moments of trashiness. It can, shamefully, be a good reflection of modern era romances, however, not much about being single but more of exploring and taking advantages of your freedom. Running Time: 7 The Cast: 7 Performance: 7 Direction: 7 Story: 6 Script: 6 Creativity: 6 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 6 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 just for Rebel Wilson. Blu-ray: Hmm, maybe if on special. 64% 6/10"
" Warning: this movie will bore you.
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,4,"Wow, this movie was boring. 'How to be Single' doesn't need nor deserves another introduction. The movie is directed by Chrsitian Ditter (Love, Rosie) and stars Dakota Johnson, Rebel Wilson, Leslie Mann and Alison Brie as four single women living in New York City, trying to find out if they want to be single or not.We, as the human race, have barely recovered from 'Fifty Shades of Grey' and Dakota Johnson throws another atrocity in our faces. It isn't as bad as this inexplicable hype was, but still, how and why, really why did this movie get made? The movie has no content, no relevant message, tried and failed at being heartfelt, and wasn't even funny. There's not much worse than a comedy, trying to be a drama as well, without any good jokes. It's plain boring. Granted, not all the characters were two-dimensional, but we never got to care about them. They're just random people, living their random uninteresting lives. The addition of Rebel Wilson was supposed to bring some comic relief but that didn't work out at all. I haven't heard a single original, smart joke the entire movie. In fact, at least four jokes or funny situation used in this movie were firstly used in the sitcom 'How I Met Your Mother'. The movie follows the four lives of four different women. Leslie Mann is Dakota Johnson's older sister, Rebel Wilson is a colleague of the latter and Alison Brie is¬Ö What on earth was her role in this movie? Her character felt irrelevant to the story, as if it her scenes were added later on in the production process. Dakota Johnson's character is the main character and the movie focuses on her in particular. Johnson did a fine job, but her character arch was so uninteresting and made the entire movie seem pointless. There's not much you can get out of this movie. No jokes, the jokes they had were already used in a sitcom, uninteresting characters, pointless storyline, a completely irrelevant character, and the list can go on and on. As a result, 'How to be Single' is a boring movie that feels way longer than the 1h 50 min it is."
" Barely tolerable
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,5,"This movie had the potential to be good, and in this day and age when love (if it really exists), is such a complicated topic, this movie's story is relevant. Especially to the tinder-culture that has developed around our notions of love and hookups. But the characters in this movie were simply... stupid for the most part. Rebel Wilson's character, Robin (or as I like to call her ""Ratchet Mc Ratchet"") , was just the definition of a hot mess. I don't know if she should be insulted for being cast as a promiscuous plus size dumb blonde in almost every movie she's in. In either case, she is exactly that in this movie and it's painful to watch. Dakota Johnson's character, Alice, was just making the same mistakes over and over again. She's the typical girl who can't stay single for long. She's your best friend that always needs to have a boyfriend. And yes, she's just as annoying as that best friend of yours.Alison Brie plays Lucy, a girl who won't settle until she finds the perfect, and I mean PERFECT man. She is annoying in the beginning, but comes to her senses eventually.And lastly, there's Leslie Mann, who plays Meg. She plays a character who is probably the most level-headed out of all the bunch and is somewhat of a saving grace in this movie. Meg is a doctor who is too busy for relationships, but yearns to be a mother. She eventually meets someone and runs into complications when she faces having to tell him she is pregnant. Overall, this movie isn't terrible. It's just annoying. Don't go into this expecting to seek some revelation or deep insight into the single life. Besides some tolerable characters, it's generally a hot mess."
