" Informative without depth, an American perspective
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,3,"I didn't choose to watch this because I find Ron Howards work rather boring, but watched this with someone who respects The Beatles, as I do.I'd happily present this cut & paste documentary as a quick course about the rise of The Beatles because their significant contribution to music (sound, writing, attitude, feeling, intelligence, learning, challenging) on so many levels. should not be questioned.Ron Howard presents the bones, but The Beatles experience & intellect is much meatier than his presentation.Never forgotten, a violent American shot & killed John Lennon. Never forgotten."
" The Live Chronicles of Beatlemania
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,10,"For a band as iconic, trendsetting, and enduring as The Beatles, it feels like there's nothing new to add, but Ron Howard's documentary will please even the most ardent fan.""Eight Days a Week"" chronicles the band's global live performances, and it's quite a journey: it starts with four young Liverpool lads, dressed in suits, having a laugh, and singing simple, poppy love songs, molded and protected by managers Brian Epstein and (later) George Martin. The reception - from their mostly teenage girl fanbase - is incredible, with Whoopi Goldberg and Sigourney Weaver giving viewers a firsthand experience of what The Beatles meant to them.While John, Paul, George, and Ringo are all featured through archive interviews, the best part of this doco is the studio banter between them, as they joke around and discuss the recording process.The band continued to rise with more albums and two movies, but the adoration was starting to wear thing by the mid-sixties, including the infamous Shea Stadium gig, with the band barely able to hear themselves above the massive crowd. The turning point was 1966, when John made his 'bigger the Jesus' comment: a seemingly harmless throwaway line that blew up in America's Bible Belt, and made it dangerous for them to tour. By then, the band were sick of touring and focused on studio albums, where they were pushing more experimental sounds with 'Rubber Soul' and 'Sgt Pepper's, seeking to reinvent themselves'. They were no longer the clean, neatly dressed mop top teen idols: they were young men who wanted to push the envelope musically.Fittingly, the doco's closing scene is the band's final live performance: the legendary rooftop concert in 1969.The oppressive madness of Beatlemania is shown through interviews, live footage, and still photos. With no narrator to guide the viewer, Howard does a brilliant job to stitch it all together into a cohesive and entertaining narrative."
" Screams Like Teen Spirit
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,8,"I'm a huge Beatles fan so I must confess to already having seen most of the admittedly cleaned-up concert footage presented here as one of the major attractions to this latest attempt to further embed the group's legendary status. Personally I don't think it needs much more embellishment and also think the film focussed on what came to be seen as a side of the business which mattered less to the group as they progressed in other ways as songwriters, singers, and studio musicians.I get that they unwittingly blazed a trail for today's world of massive outdoor gigs but having attended a number of such gigs down the years, I'm not sure that's one of the band's stronger legacies. Plonked in the middle of a football field with no magnifying screens or anything approaching an adequate sound system, it's hard to see the appeal of such concerts to anyone who came to the band through their superbly crafted studio records. Of course, the shows were more an excuse for the group's mainly young female followers to scream at their idols, helping to drown out the songs both for the rest of the audience and the group themselves. Eventually a series of mishaps, some self-inflicted, saw the group boldly abandon their profitable touring schedule and closet themselves in the studio to make their later masterpieces.I don't think I learned much that was new here. Some scholarly talking heads trill admiring comments (was that really authentic footage of the young Sigourney Weaver at one of their Stateside gigs?) but nothing revelatory is imparted. The surviving Beatles, McCartney and Starr are suitably sage and modest in their interviews and these are combined with archive footage of the long deceased Harrison and Lennon to give an accurate inside-looking-out viewpoint of what it was like to be at the eye of the storm.I'm not sure though that in the end there was anything much different here not already covered adequately in the exhaustive ""Anthology"" document made in the 90's. True fans like me can hunt down, admittedly in poorer video quality, some of the shows only represented here in snippets. Their four-song Blackpool Big Night Out TV show segment in particular shows them at their brilliant best in this period.The film is sequentially told and well edited as much as directed by Ron Howard. There's what is effectively a teaser trailer for the soon-come Get Back / Let It Be re-release under the auspices of Peter Jackson, even if the one time they allowed filmmakers complete access to their creative process was when they were on the verge of splitting up. It should however be more interesting and involving than this slightly glossy and somewhat glib presentation of their Beatlemania years."
" If you've seen anthology, then skip this one
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,3,"They put a lot of effort in colouring old clips and make fancy album art work and smoke and rain on photos, but it's nothing new. Just watch Anthology, it's perfect and complete."
" Excellent & perfect story..
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,10,"Thank you Ron Howard as well as Paul & Ringo for putting this together. Some thing's I've never heard or seen before. I did not want it to end... More, more more!!! âœŒ & ðŸ’˜"
" A Perfect movie for Beetles fans to watch on a calm holiday
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,9,I loved how big their popularity was perfectly portrayed and good job on Sound! My heart fluttered to hear their voices in improved quality. I would've given 10 if Hey Jude was featured :(
" I've really under appreciated The Beatles...
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,8,"When I was a kid, i spent more time listening to my parents Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones and Jimi Hendrix LP's than I did their Beatles ones.I have to admit I always thought the Beatles were a bit too poppy and overrated, how wrong I was!!Until watching this, I totally under appreciated the cultural impact The Beatles had around the world, and sheer volume of quality work they put out, of varying styles and influence...especially when they experimented more later in their career.They did all this whilst facing a lot of pressure while under the media spotlight, and we're able to remain honest, fun, and true to themselves without selling out.I would have liked to see a little more on the bands history once they had stopped touring in 1966, but nevertheless the focus on the Beatlemania period is really well done, and worth a watch for any music fan, regardless of genre!"
" The Beatles: Eight Days a Week - The Touring Years
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,7,"The Beatles are one of the most famous influential bands in history, between 1960 to 1970, the British rock from Liverpool conquered the world with Beatlemania, writing and performing several enduring classic songs. I heard about this documentary film while it was playing in cinemas, I was most interested to find out more about them, directed by Ron Howard (Splash, A Beautiful Mind, Rush, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Pavarotti). Basically, this film examines the ""Fab Four"" during their touring years from 1962 to 1966, from their performances at the Cavern Club in Liverpool to their final concert at Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 1966. This includes 250 concerts in Britain, America and worldwide, at least 134 songs in their back catalogue, and seven Number One albums (Please Please Me, With the Beatles, A Hard Day's Night, Beatles for Sale, Help!, Rubber Soul, and Revolver) (five albums followed after their final performance: Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Magical Mystery Tour, The White Album, Yellow Submarine, Abbey Road, and Let It Be). Band members John Lennon, Sir Paul McCartney, Sir Ringo Starr and George Harrison are seen onstage and up-close in various archive interviews, on the numerous stages, in the recording studio, and during the making of their features films, A Hard Day's Night, and Help! The film includes surprisingly underused newsreel footage, and previously unseen fan-shot footage. There are obvious modern edits to footage to improve image, sound and colour quality, but the screaming is the real deal
(including teenage fans crying and fainting during performances). The film is very well edited, features some of the best songs from the band during these years, and it really does show how the band become era-defining superstars, a most satisfactory musical documentary. With interviews from surviving band members Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Ringo Starr, archive interviews of John Lennon and George Harrison, with contributions from Richard Curtis, Eddie Izzard, Whoopi Goldberg, Elvis Costello, Richard Lester (director of A Hard Day's Night, and Help!) and Sigourney Weaver (famously caught on camera during a concert). Featuring hit songs like ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""Roll Over Beethoven"", ""A Hard Day's Night"", ""Help!"", ""She Loves Me"", ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and ""Twist and Shout"". It won the Emmy for Outstanding Sound Mixing for Nonfiction Programming (Single or Multi-Camera), and Outstanding Sound Editing for Nonfiction Programming (Single or Multi-Camera), and it was nominated for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special, Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming, and Outstanding Picture Editing for a Nonfiction Program, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Documentary. Very good!"
" Ron Howard and every director have to bring race into every movie
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,1,Why would director Ron Howard spend 20% of the movie discussing how Blacks were treated in America in this movie? The Beatles had zero to do with race relations in America in neither a positive nor a negative way. It's simply senseless to even introduce this topic into a documentary on The Beatles. I turned the movie off and will never again watch anything related to Ron Bonehead Howard.
" Yeah Yeah Yeah !!!!!!!!
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,9,"The Beatles concerts were absolutely, amazingly energetic, wild and out of control. And director Ron Howard made an incredibly fun and energetic documentary about it, documenting all the earliest footage of the Beatles LIVE. And they were TERRIFIC, ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC LIVE !!!!Hysteria in overdrive. Never ever heard or seen such a great hysteria at concerts as in these touring years of The Beatles. Girls crying, screaming until some of them fainted. Every journalist was wondering WHY these girls were screaming their lungs out so hysterically? Well, looking back it was the first wave of youth culture. The Beatles happened to be right in the midst of hundreds of millions teenagers breaking free out of the chains of restricted life.It was a great choice of director Ron Howard, to only portray The Beatles while they were touring. It gives an insight into the greatness, but also into the madness of early sixties pop culture. And the madness of it all, eventually made the Beatles decide to stop touring forever. Media attacks, record burnings, bomb scares, fans storming the stage. The touring years of the Beatles became a freak show. And they all had enough of it...After they stopped touring, the Beatles have made some of the most defining, great records. But the touring years of the Beatles are an epic period in music history that is exhilarating to watch. And I aint even a Beatles fan, but I truly think this is one of the most terrific live recordings I have ever seen, simply because of the sheer, hysteric, terrific out of control power!Yeah Yeah Yeah !!!!!"
" Yes I gave it a 10 why because The Beatles were awesome !!
",2018-12-21 00:00:00,10,This Documentary without comment from very well known Ron Howard is just amazing. You can feel the spirit from the early and mid 60ies. The Live Concerts clips are just great and even though i was not even born I can understand why the people loved them. There were ahead of there time. But I also understand why they split up in the end... not only because of the drugs but come one .... 10 years with that fandom and grewing up like that you change ... they had to split up and they did it at the right time.... great guys and a great documentary ... Please see it ... Buy it or rent it ... you will not be dissanpointed. You will sing along all the movie !! :) I assure
" A story worth telling
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,9,"The Beatles went from garage band (before garage bands existed) to the world's biggest act, and invented stadium concerts while doing so. But were they any good as a live act?Ron Howard's documentary cobbles together excerpts from most of the surviving sources of live Beatles performances and, accordingly, doesn't contain many surprises for anyone who has followed their story in any great detail. But for younger viewers, who may well be familiar with the music but not necessarily with the hysteria which surrounded it, this film is likely to be something of an eye-opener.In the early stages, as it becomes clear that The Beatles are gaining a following beyond their local fans in Liverpool, they are delighted. When they go to America to be greeted with screaming hysteria on a vast scale, they are pleased, but shell-shocked. And when, less than 4 years later, they finally stop performing to live audiences, they clearly hate the whole thing. This film shows that transition happening.But even now, and even to someone who knows the story inside out, there is something jaw-dropping about the spectacle of seeing the four of them step on stage in front of 56,000 young girls who are delivering sound beyond the volume of a jet engine.The cinema was full. This was personal history for much of the audience, fascinating documentary material for the younger members. The sound and images have been remastered, though much of it still reflects the limitations of 405-line TV and standard 8 home movies etc.The music still works, though, yeah. Yeah yeah."
" Just enjoy it and lose yourself if only for a 106 minutes.
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,7,"Made mostly of archival footage... most of it recoloured, this is quite a nice documentary... I was expecting a bit more though. Aside a few bits here and there, there doesn't seem to be that much that's new... even if there is... director Ron Howard says there is. What could be more familiar than The Beatles though? Certainly not an easy story to breathe new life into! All that said, 50 years on from the time, it remains quite incredible to watch the furore that they created, just how new, fresh, raw they were. So disregard my initial thoughts, forget pointless analysis, it's The Beatles! The greatest band the world has ever seen. Just enjoy it and lose yourself if only for a 106 minutes."
" A great nostalgia trip
",2018-04-24 00:00:00,7,"The Fab Four are the subject of this documentary beginning from the days of phenomenal superstardom during their concerts from 1963-1966.The storyline of this film (directed by Ron Howard) is great entertainment not only as a story of fame and its joys and pitfalls but also as a great trip down memory lane for this beloved group of artists.The pitfalls are few - at least as exposed here. Firstly, these superstars were relatively unscathed compared to rock artists of lesser fame. The film is a good chronology up to the mid-1960s but then it jumps to 1969. It does not delve into the years after 1966. Yes, the title tells us this is just the touring years but the viewer is still left hungering for more story up to and including the eventual breakup - a hunger that is not satisfied.But the footage and interviews do provide wonderful nostalgia for that wonderful decade that was made so great partly (some might say mainly) because of The Beatles. Such moments include the super-high in the beginning, the shift to less enthusiasm due to exhaustion from touring, dealing with a planned segregated concert in Jacksonville, controversy from John Lennon's comment on the group being more popular than Jesus, the magnificent music, and the presence of young men who were mature way beyond their years. A bonus is the unintended laughter caused by some 60s fashion (cat-eye glasses) and the screaming fits of young hysterical female fans. The latter had me howling out loud."
" Ron's best work
",2018-04-13 00:00:00,10,Really encapsulates the moments no other documentary on the Beatles has been able to do that in the same way ..
" This Is Not The Beatles Live Project!
",2018-01-26 00:00:00,5,"When I first heard that the Beatles were going to release a film called The Beatles Live Project I was thrilled. I thought it was going to be a film of some of their greatest concerts like Washington DC, Shea Stadium, Tokyo Japan and others all strung together in remastered High Quality condition. Unfortunately that did not happen. Instead Ron Howard has put together another Beatles documentary movie very similar to The Compleat Beatles which was released in the 1980's, and The Beatles Anthology which was released in the 1990's. There is some live Beatles footage in this film but for the most part it is just interviews with people recalling what it was like to be at a Beatles concert. One of the people who Ron Howard interviews in the movie is Whoopi Goldberg. What on Earth is Whoopi Goldberg doing in a movie about the Beatles? The Beatles were a band who made a career of singing songs about Peace and Love, Whoopi Goldberg is a person who has made a career of preaching hatred, racism, and social division. Thankfully she does not appear in it for very long, but long enough to make any Beatles fan feel a little ill. It's not a bad movie but it could have been better. Ron Howard has made some really good movies but this is definitely not one of them."
" Defining famous in the modern world
",2018-01-06 00:00:00,8,"Why are the Beatles still, almost sixty years after they originally formed, the most famous rock band in the world? Partly because they came in at the dawn of (and helped shape) youth culture - Beatlemania was an unprecedented phenomenon. But also because they came in at the dawn of (and helped shape) modern popular music - and did so both initially as purveyors of superior, catchy, but essentially lightwieght music, and then later as genuine artists, who widened the vocabulary of music itself. And they did all this in just ten years. Ron Howard's documentary tells the first half of the story, in which they became the world's biggest touring band, but also began a transition that was to lead them to their greatest works, but also off the live stage. It's not a bad film, with plenty of songs and concert clips, interviews old and new, and it's both interesting and delightful to see the freshness and honesty of the band in their early days: when the road to superstardom was unmapped, they seem human in a way that few of their successors do. The ""we all loved each other"" story is probably only part of the truth - but it's broadly plausible as an account of the early years in a way it wouldn't be of the later ones. It's hard to imagine there will ever be another group that achieves the same impact on music and the world."
" Excellent Bio of The Beatles Band Years
",2017-12-06 00:00:00,8,"This is running on PBS, and it is worth seeing, even with pledge breaks. Ron Howard really did a great job directing this. The script was well written by a couple of solid writers. The stock footage used is top notch. The facts are as amazing as the group. What did the Beatles Years all really mean?Howard, a baby boomer might have understood the Beatles the best because he was 9 years old in 1963. Kids that age were in awe of what the group did, they grew up with them. The portrait here of how things were done by the group as they started out and grew is really a story that might not ever happen again today. Our society structure is so much different now. How did The Beatles work?Up until the right 4 guys were together, the early Beatles did not get anywhere. To approximately quote Ringo here, ""When the 4 of us got together, the chemistry just seemed to fit. It was magic."" It sure was, and because it was, the group rose to the highest of heights, and then broke up. This film focus is that rise.The point made late in the film is very true. When anyone gets too successful, the competition comes after you, and you become complacent and grow apart from yourself, losing sight of your original goals. This happens to everyone, who is young enough to live a long time after being this successful. It is not a spoiler to go over their success. This film goes beyond and actually digs into the personal feelings of the band as they got to the top, and then tried not to fall off. The film does note when those falls began, and why. It is told better here, than any other film including the Beatles own films.Rare footage is used here, including the groups last concert together, a unique and totally unplanned event. It is stunning. Even folks who are not Beatles fans should really appreciate this master piece of the telling of this story for what it is and what they were, phenomenal."
" solid documentary for Beatles fans
",2017-11-07 00:00:00,7,"I've always been a big fan of the Beatles. That means I'm the target audience for this movie, but it also means that a lot of it was overly familiar. As a chance to see some nice clips of the Beatles and get a better sense of their touring years this is pretty good, but the best documentaries can draw you into a story you have no interest in, while 8 Days a Week feels like it's really only aimed at fans.I felt restless through much of the first half of the movie, but things got more interesting as it progressed. Much of the strength of the movie is it conveys exactly how massive a cultural even The Beatles were; it's hard to get your head around if you weren't a part of it. The crush of the crowds is overwhelming, the way they affected people was startling, and they seemed to be generally decent people, even using their considerable influence to de-segregate an arena. Still, this feels more like some PBS documentary that somehow got a theatrical release. It's good if you like the Beatles, but it is less interesting than it should be, considering the subject."
" Decent film, but nothing new for the devoted
",2017-10-31 00:00:00,6,"This is an interesting documentary, but it doesn't tell anything that the devoted doesn't already know. Somehow, the movie also seems to take for granted that the audience knows who The Beatles are and how big their impact was on popular music and society in general, as if this is something everyone already should know about.I would actually recommend ""Living in the Material World"" (the documentary about The Beatles' lead guitarist George Harrison) rather than ""Eight Days a Week"". ""Living..."" not only gives a much better background to who The Beatles are and where they came from, but it also digs deeper and gives the viewer a better understanding of their incredible impact in so many areas. It's also much longer, but the first half of it (which covers his time in The Beatles) is better than this whole film.The best thing about ""Eight Days a Week"" is not the film itself, but the fact that the live album ""Live at the Hollywood Bowl"" finally got remastered and re-released. The film is also decent, but there are better documentaries out there."
" Yeah,Yeah,Yeah! A must see documentary for Beatles fans and the late curious!
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,8,"This is director Ron Howard's ode to the celebrated band The Beatles in formative years centering on the group's touring years circa 1963-1966. Newly restored footage and sound collected from over 200 concerts and locations to become pieces of musical/Beatles history. Plenty of interview snippets bringing some context to their place in time.Most of the songs imaginable are there in locations like Liverpool, Hamburg, the Netherlands, the Phillipines , Hong Kong, New Zealand, Australia, Hollywood Bowl, The Ed Sullivan Show, The Hullabaloo TV show, Ready, Set, Go TV Show, Shea Stadium and Candlestick Park.Interviews, some by archive footage, help paint a picture of the Fab Four. We hear from the group itself, plus the individuals and other notables like Ed Sullivan, George Martin, Brian Epstein, Muhammed Ali, Neil Aspinall, Sigourney Weaver, Larry King, Richard Lester, Whoopi Goldberg, Harold James and Eddie Izzard.Even the non-Beatles fan can find this documentary amazing!"
" Good 'nostalgia-mentary' of a remarkable period of musical history
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,7,"After more than 50 years, there's not much new that can be said about the birth and rise of the ""Beatlemania"" phenomenon, so don't expect any great surprises or revelations in Ron Howard's documentary of the Beatles touring period. The footage is great as are the interviews (even the 'celebrity' interviews such as Whoopi Goldberg add something to the story). No reason to suggest Beatle's fans watch this new addition to Beatle-nostalgia (they will), but the movie's worth viewing by anyone who remembers the era or likes the music (or, of course, both). I still find it sad to watch images of John Lennon, knowing how pointless and untimely his death was."
" Lennon and McCartney were the best song writing team ever
",2017-09-20 00:00:00,8,"9/17/17. This documentary is a good reminder of just how crazy teenagers were in the '60s. What struck me about the Beatles now was just how good their sound was and how talented they really were. They deserved all the success they got, but as humans they just couldn't maintain their professional ties, to the detriment of pop music. They were a cultural phenomenon and true rock icons who had it all but couldn't keep it going. Perhaps, that is the saddest part of watching this - they made wonderful music, but only for a short time, in retrospect. Together, Lennon and McCartney were the best music writing team ever. Separately they were hardly half of what they were together. They balanced each other out. While McCartney continued to be successful, none of his own works ever surpassed the work he did with Lennon. (Although I did like Ram) And, Lennon turned into an embittered, cynical angry man who just couldn't get over the slights he tried to overcome. And, when he finally got close to getting his act together we all know what happened that one December day."
" A glimpse into their world...
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,9,"A few caveats. 1) I am NOT an Art School major who is going to critique the ""Editing"" or ""Scene Changes"".2) I was born after these guys had their run. My introduction to them came from my parents.3) I am a big fan of their music, mostly the main-stream hits.4) I frequently watch documentariesThis is a snippet in the life of the Beatles, it tries to go backward to explain how they got 'there', and once it does it moves on. As the title says the ""Touring Years"" which means that after their final live Roof-Top show there isn't anything else to say. It focuses on the few years that they toured-the-world...It doesn't discuss ""where are they now"" or any information into marriages, or kids or deaths, etc.The soundtrack is of course AMAZING, (like I said, I'm a fan). The footage used has obviously been restored. I thought it was really cool that I could be watching 50yr old video and see the 'sweat' streaming down Paul's face while he plays. The quality of the remastered audio/video made it feel very immersive (or at least I thought).So, if you are a FAN of their music, and a general FAN of them, I would definitely suggest you watch this. If for no other reason, just the soundtrack is awesome, I found myself smiling randomly while watching this. And while I doubt there is much 'previously unseen' content in here, it was just FUN FUN FUN to watch. And actually listening to the Recordings of some of their hits, you can pickup on minute changes between what we know 'today' and what was intended originally.Again, definitely recommend!!!"
" Entertaining documentary
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,6,"I guess most people on the planet know about the Beatles. This documentary looks specifically at their touring years. By modern standards the Beatles weren't together very long. If you look at the major bands headlining festivals nowadays the chances are they've been around for 20+ years. Back in the 60's this wasn't really the norm though, so the Beatles were a very long lasting band by the standard of the time. The documentary looks at the 3 phases of the Beatles; the formative years, the single years and the music years. Those are my classifications. The formative years were played out in Hamburg and small British venues such as the Cavern Club. The single years were from around 1962 through 1965 where they pushed out a bunch of singles that dominated the charts. The music years (or drug years!) were 1966 through 1970 where they pushed the popular music boundaries and changed the direction of popular music forever. This movie is very much focused on the 1960-1965 period as that's when the Beatles played live. There is no doubt that the fervour surrounding the Beatles was unique and is unlikely to ever be repeated, so the movie is really engaging. One of the things that really stood out for me in the movie was the sheer inadequacy of the sound systems they used. Most present day hi-fi systems would have more power than the systems the Beatles were using to play to thousands of people. If you are interested in the Beatles or music in general you should definitely watch this movie."
" A Closer Look at the Touring Years of Four Immortal Englishmen from The Old Smoke.
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,9,"Reporter: ""What place do you think this story of The Beatles is going to have in the history of Western culture?""Paul McCartney: ""You must be kidding with that questionÂ…it's not culture, it's a good laugh!""When you think of truly iconic musicians, who springs to mind? The likes of Mozart, Beethoven, Elvis and of course The Beatles. And now nearly 50 years after they stopped touring, actor and director Ron Howard has produced a documentary entitled The Beatles: Eight Days a Week â€“ The Touring Years; which looks at the touring years of the band between 1962 â€“ 1966.The Beatles are undoubtedly the most successful group in music history. These four lads from Liverpool â€“ John, Paul, George and Ringo â€“ are estimated to have sold around 600 million albums worldwide since their formation in 1960. They continued to dominate the charts in the UK and overseas, until they split in 1970.In the Music world, these four English lads from The Old Smoke are regarded as the pioneers of the so-called (in America) British- Invasion or the inevitable global industry domination.And Eight Days A Week brings us the story of The Beatles during their touring years of 1962 until 1966. Directed by Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind, The Da Vinci Code), this documentary provides a mixture of interviews, footage, photos and recordings of The Beatles, as they worked their way from small venues in the north of England, to becoming four of the most recognisable faces of the 1960s. Along this journey, we see how their manager Brian Epstein created their image, the recording process of the Fab Four, and the changes in their musical style as we move through the 1960s.A milestone in the music industry came when The Beatles played to a crowd of almost 56,000 fans in August 1965, at the Shea Stadium in New York. No other artist had attempted to play to this capacity, and their music was spread around the stadium via the Tannoy system. Footage of this and other concerts can be seen in the documentary, including the overwhelming reaction of the band as they are faced with the screams of their audience. It is interesting to note that two future Beatle wives were in the audience at Shea Stadium; Linda Eastman (wife of Paul) and Barbara Bach (wife of Ringo).Interviews with the two remaining Beatles, Paul and Ringo, and former interviews with John and George are in short supply. Eight Days A Week is mostly images and footage, with voice-overs in place. Those hoping to learn about the childhoods, marriages or personal lives of the Fab Four will be disappointed. Additionally, there is no mention of the breakup of The Beatles in this documentary; its entire focus is almost all on the touring years. However, there is plenty of behind the scenes footage of the band and those around them during the early 60s, as we hear how being a Beatle came with both ups and downs. We also see the relationship the Fab Four had with each other during this period of great success.Any hardcore Beatle fans will not learn anything new from this documentary, but it is still a fascinating glimpse into the early years of a band who have certainly left their mark on Western culture."
" Crazy......
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,9,"Ron Howard's nice documentary about just how crazy Beatlemania was and how the touring degenerated into a screaming noise where - as Ringo put it - ""I had not idea where we were in the songs, I was drumming by watching how they were shaking their asses to know where we were in the song"".Perhaps glosses over some of the later tensions but it's a good fun movie.Hang fire after the credits for 30mins of restored footage of the Shea Stadium concert."
" A nice look at the Beatles' touring years, but...
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,7,"...at 137 minutes, I felt there was something missing. Before I go on to a small rant, I'd like to just say that there is no absolute way to do a comprehensive look at the Beatles in any short length of time. That would take up a number of hours! I would also like to point out that there are several people who have helped the Beatles become who they are, in any part of the world. Whether they are a disk jockey playing their music on the radio, or attending their performances while they were nobodies.I am disappointed that there was not one mention of Ron Elz (a.k.a. Johnny Rabbit), who was the first to play a Beatles song in a major radio market, St. Louis. The story goes like this: George Harrison was the first Beatle to set foot in the United States, where he started at Lambert-St. Louis Airport in September 1963. By that time he was a star in Europe, but in America no one took notice yet of Beatlemania. George was on his way to his sister's house in Benton, Illinois (two hours away) but before he ventured that way, he stopped at a few radio stations in St. Louis and gave away promo copies of Beatles records to anyone who would listen. Elz was the first and only person to respond and played ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on his ""Make It Or Break It"" nightly segment. The audience chose to 'break it'. Harrison became friends with Elz. There was also a DJ in West Frankfort, Illinois that played a Beatles record, long before they were noticed in America. The Beatles would invite Elz to introduce them on stage at their first concert in America, in San Francisco. Needless to say, they were more than appreciative of him.That said, the movie was interesting. Not much stuff I didn't know, especially for a long-time Beatles enthusiast. It was cool hearing from random celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg and Sigourney Weaver about the impact of Beatlemania, along with people not many have heard of, including the DJ from Miami who hung around the Beatles during their tour. Great clips and photographs, many I have never seen."
" Nothing new
",2017-05-31 00:00:00,5,This does have some interesting elements to it but in the main I didn't really see or hear anything new.Of course it is always great seeing the Beatles perform in their hey day but even the clips chosen were not necessarily the best they could have used. I would have preferred to have seen better and longer clips of them playing instead of concentrating on the screaming stadium concerts which I am sure even the Beatles would admit were not their best.Some of the 'guest stars' chosen were bizarre. I couldn't care less what a second rate comedian such as Eddie Izzard thinks.I like Ron Howard and think he is usually a good director but this is not his finest moment.
" Gorgeous trip down memory lane
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,9,"If like me, you were (or are) a fan of the Beatles, this film should be an inspiration. I was growing up at the time of their touring days, yet I was too young to have attended any of those shows. But, by the time the White album came out, I was hooked, and their music was quite iformative, inspiring, and powerful to me at the time. Watching this movie brought back some of that power and charm, and the sense of what an amazing point in history the 1960's were. The film was a bit sketchy in that it did not reveal much about the men. Could have delved into the characters and craziness of the touring a bit more. But, I sense that Howard was bringing a sense of reverence to the project, and did not feel the need for the sordid details. He have certainly seen enough of that in various other documentaries about rock stars over the years.I have to say, I found this film uplifting, and very, very enjoyable to watch. Witnessing the evolution of their music (I never really payed much attention to them until Rubber Soul) was great. What a band. What a bunch of great guys. Gentlemen, spokesmen, sincere, brilliant, and creative as they come. Wow."
" John was right. They really were bigger than Jesus...
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,9,"...and in some ways, they still are.This is a group that played their last live (paying) show over 50 years ago, and they get still get a documentary movie made about their formative years which is released in theaters in 2016 and does respectable business.I was all of seven years old when they quit touring, and don't remember it happening in real time. So even though I've seen a bunch of these clips ""snippeted"" in the last half-century of my life, many of the behind the scenes day-to-day nuggets were all new, and well worth a viewing.To see the fan-love of the tours (U.S. and around the world) is still pretty unbelievable to look at. It was a different era, so instead of online mass adoration, EVERYBODY (REALLY, EVERYBODY!) JUST WENT OUT & SHOWED UP TO CATCH ANY KIND OF GLIMPSE THEY COULD GET OF THEM!This phenomenon probably wouldn't still be looked at with this much reverence today if the music doesn't stand the test of time. BUT IT DOES.If you like the sixties, or love the Beatles, you gotta' see this one."
" Excellent documentary on the most influential band in history
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,10,"Directed by Ron Howard, a documentary on the Beatles, focusing almost exclusively on their ""touring years' - 1963 to 1966. Includes interviews and press conferences with the Beatles, rare footage and recordings and interviews with people who were influenced by the Beatles.Excellent documentary. The fact that it is directed by Ron Howard lets you know that this going to be more than your average blow-by- blow documentary. It's quite an emotional experience, as you see the young, not-yet-famous band start out on the road to stardom, how they deal with the increasing fame and, in some instances, how it overwhelms them. The footage and stills often capture many of their moments of joy and triumph, adding to the engagement factor, plus the concert and studio footage gives you a great feeling of artistic geniuses at work.There's also an energy and pioneering spirit about it all, created largely through Ron Howard's choice of footage and editing. The interviewees, which include such luminaries as Elvis Costello, Sigourney Weaver and Whoopi Goldberg, also show how young people's lives were affected by the Beatles.In addition, the sense of friendship and camaraderie between the four is palpable. Another benefit about having a big-name director/producer make the movie - you get to hear actual Beatles tracks, all wonderfully produced. Not some amorphous background non-Beatles track because the producer couldn't get the rights to play their music.While not covering the entire Beatles history, well, not in any depth - pre-63 and post-67 are covered but really just as prescript and postscript respectively - this is still the most definitive documentary on the Beatles. No documentary I've seen so accurately captures the impact of the Beatles and their influence on music, culture and, especially, everyday people."
" Throw it on the pile
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,7,"If there weren't already more exhaustive and authoritative takes on the Beatles, I'd give this a higher score.Also, if you really dig the Beatles's story, this flick puts a bad taste in your mouth in the first five minutes. Howard thinks he can do his actuality voodoo to graft Ringo properly onto the Beatles in Hamburg. He made the calculation that fans would shrug that off as artistic license... but it does reek a bit. He didn't even have to mention Stu and Pete by name: All he really would have needed to do is mention that Ringo joined on pretty quickly when the new demands of studio recording, back in England, necessitated a more professional percussionist. That's a great part of the story, an homage to Ringo, not onerous to bear, and certainly a weird thing to jettison in the interests of squeezing the matter into the 100min runtime.Now, I'd direct you to the Beatles Anthology, which covers their career exhaustively, authoritatively, and in greater detail and is a trove of key audio and video.That said, I was a bit astonished at some of the really cool and unique bits Howard got his mitts on that I hadn't seen before. And I have to admit that, after the above-mentioned hamfisted edit, Howard makes some fine compositional choices for his finished product. He targeted a particular segment of the pageant which was the Beatles, and made a decent go of it. Gotta hand it to ol' Opie."
" Fascinating look at the greatest Band EVER
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,10,"Kudos to Ron Howard, Giles Martin and the rest who brought this brilliant and fascinating documentary to life. Nothing earth changing here, just a wonderful look at the greatest band ever, who were world changing, during the days that they toured. As one watches this, look at the primitive state in which they performed, yet perform they did. Starting with Hamburg, they worked hard - were not overnight sensations - to become the band they were. I liken these four getting together to the signers of the Declaration of Independence or the signing of the Magna Carta. The Beatles were brilliant - an no one will ever challenge them. Ever. Just a great, enjoyable documentary that I hope will win a BAFTA and an Academy Award."
" Ron Howard's best film in years
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,6,"EIGHT DAYS A WEEK is perhaps Ron Howard's best film in years, as it's a straightforward documentary feature without any of that sappy stuff that keeps spoiling his feature films. The aim of the documentary is to tell the story of the Beatles, both in their own words and at the height of their fame, using a ton of footage that's been discovered over the years. Thus we get a lot of photographs overlaid with sound taken from recording studios, plus clips of world tours, concerts, and the like.There's not really a narrative of sorts, although the events play out in a chronological order. The running time is added to with the inclusion of interview snippets from some famous fans such as Whoopi Goldberg, while Paul McCartney also gets plenty of screen time. EIGHT DAYS A WEEK has a fast pace and plenty of insight, making it a must-see music documentary, and that comes from somebody who doesn't even consider himself a big Beatles fan."
