" Unique
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,9,"Rarely does an artist, particularly an under-appreciated Australian artist that gets way too little credit for in his home country, allow the war story of truth and unfettered access to the artistic process of one of our best artists since Federation. EU might claim him as their own, and it's true he has collaborated with many artists outside of Oz because his talent is all too rare in the ""pub rock rules"" world of standard Oz life, but I found myself not only inspired all over again, but in absolute awe of the authenticity of this film. It will be all too easy for the haters to can this film as ""wankery"", bit I dare say a lot of that is a mix of jealousy mixed with a complete misunderstanding of how hard it is to mix truth with the the art of storytelling. I am off now too wrote more songs, as that as all I feel worthy to do after such a revelatory experience."
" Nick Cave Pairs True Genius With True Work Ethic
",2019-09-07 00:00:00,10,"It's a rare thing, that relentless habit Nick Cave has of continually pushing past himself to realize his own next level as both a lyricist and front man of the aspirational Bad Seeds. His articulations on God, love, death, and the act of artistic creation itself are fully realized in this unique documentary.Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard build surprising visual stylings around Cave's narrated tour of his history and mind. As a mirror to his lyrics, his remarkable introspection allows us a better incidental understanding of our own lives.This is a great music-driven documentary, and one which shares the good news of Cave's steady ascension into the pantheon of music's great translators of the human condition."
" Like a discarded home project bonus on a CD album
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,1,"Extremely dull, nothing close to being actually musical, and absolutely deprived of character and charisma due to he geniuses confining the scope to 1 day and thus having nothing to work with. Interviews on Youtube holds your attention better than this detritus."
