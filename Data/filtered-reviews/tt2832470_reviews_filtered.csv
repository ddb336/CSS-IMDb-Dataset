" A Fun Gory Adventure
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,7,Taking place after the events of Dead Snow with it's remaining last survivor he by accident gets the same power to raise the dead after hearing what the leader of the Nazi platoon has planned which is to finish an uncompleted mission.This film brings back the dark comedy and well done makeup work. I felt despite this the story had some faults such as the leader being beheaded by a tank that would end his reign and stop the soldiers from attacking yet the doctor who is a zombie still lives which doesn't quite makes sense even for this type of film. It was also off the fact a town would evacuate it's residency to prevent a Nazi zombie take over I find it hard to believe everyone bought that and got out of Dodge.Another odd thing is if the leader is to raise a bigger army of zombies why did he just chose a few humans he recently killed instead of making all the recently killed people also zombies?Aside from these it's a fun film and fun watching zombies kill each other and the Zombie Squad take part.
" No. No. No. Don't taint fond memories of D√∏d sn√∏ with this dreck
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,1,"D√∏d sn√∏ 2 is 100 minutes of your life you will never get back. It is awful. Worse, it is awful and premised on a really fun and good zombie movie,D√∏d sn√∏. Don't. Just don't."
" To Put It Plainly: FUN!
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,9,My first ever IMDB review was made out of my fondness for this comedy/horror. I simply could not stop smiling as these movie is made for people who want to escape from reality and have a dang good time. Bravo to everyone involved in creating this little slice of horror heaven!
" Allright
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,6,"D√∏d sn√∏ was a great surprise and a great pleasure to me. The second movie got for sure the bigger production but besides that I prefer the first one - I felt more connected to the characters and the gore and humor was more on the point. D√∏d sn√∏ 2 is still good but offering more of everything does not automatically make a movie the better one. A solid piece for the lover of zombie mayhem, but maybe a little bit disappointing too - especially because the 2nd movie is all in all more a horror comedy, whereas the first one got some humor too but felt more like a ""real"" horror movie."
" ... and then you discover there was a sequel, 6 years later
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed the first one a lot; fun, laughs, jokes, tropes, references to other movies...
And then in 2020 you discover a sequel was made in 2014 üò±
Of course, a sequel, I probably shouldn't get my hopes up, but... it was a blast. Tying it in with the previous movie, seamlessly I might add, they step up the gore, jokes, √°nd destroy some cliches by breaking the rules. (Babies aren't off limits)
It's more Brain Dead and Shaun of the Dead, than Dawn of the Dead, so if that's your thing and you haven't seen both of them (Dead Snow's) yet, definitely see both of them. üëç(And of course a short after-credits scene)"
" Sieg Heil Oberst
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,5,The comedy could have been deleted entirely. It could have been made serious. The Nazis were great especially the eyepatched Panzerjager. The best scene was the intestines scene with the tank. Its a shame everyone didn't die and the Nazis succeeded. Oberst Herzog lost some of his frostbite but is still sexy as ever.
" Surprisingly fresh for featuring rotten corpses
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,7,"This film had fantastic practical effects and the special effects team does their best (worst?) to offer up escalating gore. These guys do things with intestines that you can't unsee. Merciless scalpings and head stompings are just the icing on the cake as there's no mercy whatsoever, even for babies, or the disabled. If you wanted a feast of blood and guts, you got it. The kill count here is increased and the kills didn't seem like they were done before as it had some moments that had me genuinely surprised and I'm glad this genre is still able to do that. You can just sit down with your friends, relax and enjoy some brutally awesome kills.It was so much fun, you don't really need to think much about this film as the humor was there, some of it fell flat but mostly it was just a really fun film. Nobody took themselves seriously here and they were able to experiment with the comedy horror. I said before that comedy and horror don't really mix but this film makes it work because it's wacky but not too wacky and it was a unique concept to take on the genre.There were only three things that I didn't like. First was the cops as they didn't provide anything for the plot, except an extra plotline to extend the runtime of the film. The second one is the Russian zombies as they had the same problem as the nazi zombies had in the first movie - they just weren't menacing. And the third one is the ending as it promotes a kink for zombies. The latter did provide some shock factor and very least."
" I was mislead by high reviews.
",2020-07-21 00:00:00,2,"This movie was dubbed a comedy. There was zero funny moments in this movie. I can tell it's trying to be funny but really it's just awful attempts with no wit. Also I can tell this isnt a super low budget movie, but I've seen much better B movies. The story line is way to simple it's not interesting, the failed attempts at humor - the CGI zombies will give this a bump to 2 stars."
" Not terrible, but it was a disappointment to me
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,5,"There are some fun ideas (super powered zombie arm, special zombie powers reviving different armies, zombies driving a tank, and a frequently abused zombie on the good guy's side who dies multiple times), but the execution is often off. There are a couple of funny parts, and some of the gore is sort of satisfying, but it's strangely a little bit dull. Also worth mentioning: some of the characters are super annoying. Gets points for creativity, but loses a bunch for it just not gelling together as well as I'd hoped. 17 year old me really liked the first Dead Snow, so maybe 25 year old me is just getting too old for this kind of thing."
" Funniest Zombie movie...
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,8,A great sequel to Dod Sno! This movie does a fantastic job in making the Nazi zombie apocalypse funny!
" Cartoon violence and action, gore and humor, all rolled into one schlocky but enjoyable package
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,6,"Colonel Herzog and his army of undead Nazi's are back, and so too is Vegar Hoel as Martin, sole survivor of Tommy Wirkola's 2009 horror comedy, in this riotous follow up that amps the bad taste humour to maximum volume. Martin wakes up in hospital with a zombie arm grafted on to replace his own which he lost in the previous outing, it has a life of its own and kills anybody who comes near Martin including an unlucky American kid who gets flung out of a window. Herzog commandeers a tank from a war museum and blows apart moms and toddlers with shells. Along the way Martin is helped by a gay museum curator and the Zombie Squad, American nerds who battle the undead for a living, and raises an army of undead Russian soldiers to deliver some payback to Herzog once and for all in the ultimate zombie grudge match. Filming of this knowingly demented schlockfest took place in Iceland, and was shot in English and Norwegian simultaneously. Most of the zombies were played by professional MMA fighters, whom Wirkola found easy to direct especially for the climatic showdown which resembles an undead version of the Royal Rumble. The movie received its world premiere at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival."
" Best comedy/horror EVER!! A MUST see!!
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,10,"Not going to bother describing a masterpiece comedy/horror film, just going to tell you WATCH this movie!"
" Much more than expected
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"I was expecting a B movie, but it was so fun and really good acting. This is definitely not a B movie. It is a great comedy horror movie with a lot of unexpected funny happenings."
" One of my best zombie movies
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,10,"A great zombie movie with hard comedy and action, just a delightful Crazy movie."
" Take off your snob glasses....
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,7,"Shakespeare this ain't. Kurosawa this ain't. Citizen Kane this ain't (thank god).
Crude, overly violent, low budget, offensive ?? Sure.Funny, self aware, entertaining, pure escapism ?? Yes !!
Rather than criticising this for what is isn't how about enjoying it for what it is. A low budget horror comedy with no airs or graces that is fully self aware of it's utter ludicrousness. Switch off your brain and enjoy."
" Fun Sequel that Builds on the Mythos
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,8,"Since I finally got around to seeing the original, I figured that I might as well go through and check out this sequel as well. I really enjoyed the first one so that really helped and wanted to see where they took this one. The synopsis is still on the run from a group of Nazi zombies, a man seek the aid of a group of American zombie enthusiasts and discovers new techniques for fighting the zombies.We pick this up right where the last one left off. Martin (Vegar Hoel) is attacked in his car by Herzog (√òrjan Gamst). He does get the car going and ends up tearing off Herzog's arm. The Nazi zombies meet up with their leader and he brings anyone back that they kill.Martin wakes up in the hospital where he is in custody. Since they never found the bodies of the zombies, he is accused of murdering his friends by Gunga (Hallvard Holmen), a local cop. He also realizes that the doctor attached the arm from the car on to Martin, the problem being that it didn't originally belong to him. At first he can't control it and he ends up killing those that get in his way. He flees into the night.His path leads him to a museum where he meets Glenn Kenneth (Stig Frode Henriksen). It is there he learns more of the past for Herzog and through Glenn, learns where he is going. Herzog shows up at the museum as well, killing everyone there. It is after he leaves that Martin realizes that his arm has a power that he didn't before, he's able to raise people from the dead like Herzog. Reinforcements are called in as well. The group is made up of Daniel (Martin Starr), Monica (Jocelyn DeBoer) and Blake (Ingrid Haas) who're known as the Zombie Squad. Daniel when he learns about Martin's ability figures out a way to prevent Herzog from completing his mission, which involves a unit of Soviet soldiers led by Stavarin (Derek Mears). Can they get there in time though?Now I can say, my thoughts on sequels are that if you're going to do it, you really need to ramp it up more than what we get in the previous one. What I like here is that we get some of that. I like that we get to see more of what Herzog does in his ability to raise the dead. We also get more to the story where we get a bit of Dawn of the Dead in that he is trying to complete the mission he had in life.My problem then becomes, how did he come back from the dead in the first place? I thought the idea in the original film was that he and his men have been patrolling that area. It now seems that Martin and his friends did something to wake them, but I don't recall that being established. The only thing would be finding the gold hidden under the floor boards at the cabin. If that was what did it, no one has found it in the all the years after the war? I just feel this is a slight inconsistency. The other thing is we see that the bodies can be continually brought back to life until they're pretty much a pile of mush. We see it done in both this and the pervious film, but the men just seem to give up here when their soldiers are killed in the climax. Also the Nazis have a tank, they could have decimated the other ranks, but they don't. It just feels like some plot-holes personally that don't ruin the film, but effect it from being better.Because I don't want to end this aspect of the film on a downer, I like the introduction to these new characters. The Zombie Squad is funny, because they're nerds. On top of that, I like the concept of 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend'. In World War II, the Soviets were allies to the United States, so it fitting they would team up here. They kind of have to be since Martin brought them back from the dead, but that's semantics. Plus I love that Monica is a Star Wars fan. Doesn't necessarily fit, but I like seeing good looking nerdy girls.That will take me to the pacing. I do feel that this goes a bit long for a horror comedy. We get a runtime of 100 minutes, which I think there are ten minutes that could be trimmed. I don't necessarily know if we need everything that we get with Gunga and his police officers. It doesn't really add anything if I'm going to be perfectly honest and flees like comedic padding that didn't land for me. Other than that, I think we get some good action here and it is pretty fun overall. The ending is a bit odd, but it doesn't hurt the overall product.As for the acting, I also thought it was good. Hoel reprising his role was solid. We don't get much character growth, just what we got in the previous film has already happened so it is just him continuing being the badass. I guess this is a slight issue if someone jumped into this sequel without seeing the first. Gamst is solid as the villain as well and his look is just great. Starr is funny in this leader of the nerds type of way. I like DeBoer and Haas as well. It is interesting to see Henriksen take on a different role here that is nothing really like his from the previous film. It is also fun to see Mears as the leader of the Soviet unit. I would say the rest of the actors who are both human and zombies alike were solid in rounding out this movie for what was needed.That will take me to the effects, which again I thought were good. The zombie make-up looks great. The practical effects were really good and I have no complaints there. Since this movie ramped up the gore, we do get a bit more CGI which doesn't always look great. I would have to say though that on the overall, I'm much more positive on the effects than negative. The film is also shot pretty well if I'm going to be perfectly honest.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. For the most part it fit for what was needed and didn't necessarily stand out. What I had to talk about is the song that is used for the final sequence. They use Bonnie Tyler's 'Total Eclipse of the Heart'. At first I was confused, but when I realized where they were going, it was great. I love that song and it makes what happens quite funny as well.Now with that said, I really dug this sequel. I think that it did some good things to build off what we got in the previous one. There are some minor plot-holes that are created though so I did have a slight problem there. The acting though is good across the board and I think that the effects are for the most part. There are some minor issues with the CGI. I do think that this runs a tad long, but other than that, it is still fun and I do enjoy it. Being a comedy does hurt building tension. I'm not going to lie though, there was a scene with Glenn that really had me tense. The soundtrack fit for what was needed so that also helps as well. Overall I'd say this is an above average film. It is a bit of a step back, but still worth your time. Interestingly enough, this film is in English which threw me off a bit with the first one not being so there's that.7.5/10"
" Flush both #1 and #2 down the toilet
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,1,"A distasteful waste of time with every genre clich√© thrown in the book to give Nazi zombies their due. The film making is so bad, that the tone seems to shift to the side of the NZ's throughout a large chunk of the movie. Hitler most likely danced with glee so fervently for his follower's portrayal in the first two movies (especially with the movie's acidity towards gays), that Director Wirkola has planned to resurrect him for the final chapter. This movie is the equivalent of your know-it-all cousin who is too dumb to realize that living in his mom's house on wheels isn't as cool as he would have everyone believe."
" More Blood, More Gore, More Badass!
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,9,"This is a well deserved sequal, most sequals suck, and go to big, but this goes big, but in the best way possible."
" Can a sequel be better? Oh yes
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,10,The dark humour is delightful and ending superb... well placed masterpiece
" So much better than the original!!
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,7,"Wow, a sequel that surpasses the original by miles!! EVERYTHING about this film was better. While 'Dead Snow' was a mindless slasher horror comedy, 'Dead Snow 2' has a lot more substance to it, with a much better story, and more fleshed out characters. This is not a slasher film in the true sense of slasher films.'Dead Snow 2' follows directly where the first film left off. Vegar Hoel is back as the film's protagonist and he is excellent in this film. The make-up effects and visuals are groundbreaking. The film is totally unapologetic and merciless. It is bloody, gory, and completely and utterly demented. (I love it!!). The dialogue is equally wacky, crude and rude. I mean, they use dialogue like ""Would you eat my little man-pussy"", uttered by a male police inspector.The action sequences are great. From an entertainment perspective, this is everything and more I want to be entertained. (that's if you can stomach some of the graphic, gory scenes). In context with what was happening, some of these grotesque scenes were actually funny - in a demented kind of way. This was awesome. Incredible!!"
" THE ZOMBIE SQUAD
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,10,"Martin (Vegar Hoel) survived the horrible tragedy with the lost of an arm as the movie recaps the first film and picks up where it leaves off. Martin gets a zombie arm sewn onto him as the police blame him for the carnage. Becoming a fugitive, Martin is aided by an American ""Zombie Squad"" three techno-weenies who believe in zombies. The Zombie Nazi army must be stopped.Not since the ""Return of the Living Dead"" have I had so much fun watching a zombie film, one that included ""Star Wars"" references. Sure Vegar Hoel is no Bruce Campbell, but he did a good job for a cheesy zombie film which improved on its special effects over the first one.Must see for zombie fans.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" FUN CAMPY ZOMBIE MOVIE TO WATCH
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,7,This is a fun campy zombie movie to watch. Instant classic!
" Hilariously good bloody fun
",2018-10-17 00:00:00,9,I enjoyed the first Dead Snow...but absolutely howled with this one! It was so fun to watch - so silly and over-the-top in every good way. And I just had to root for Herr Herzog! Ha! You simply MUST make time to watch both!
" Improves on the first
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,6,"""Zombis Nazis 2"" is a highly entertaining, tongue-in-cheek, silly, over the top splatter which pays homage to movies like ""Evil Dead"" while keeping its own personality. Only some problems of pace and some decisions over a couple of characters (as the cringe-worthy at moments Glenn) let the movie down.Even if you haven't watched the first one, ""Zombies Nazis 2"" brings you up to pace pretty fast: Martin and friends went to have a crazy weekend at a cabin, but some zombies, which were also Nazis, decided to kill them all. Martin was the only survivor (minus right arm) and he is happy to have come out alive. However, things get complicated again pretty fast: he is suspect of the deaths of his friends and detained. And the zombies are not happy with just getting their gold back.Cue lots of splatter, blood, silly, but very silly humor (again, sometimes a little bit cringe-worthy) and a very on your face approach to the proceedings. Wirkola does a great job in keeping everything going on (even if the pace suffers at moments, specially with the apparition of the Zombie Squad and the side quest to find the Russians), putting a joke when we are starting to get tired of so many guts flying around. The actors do a great job, jumping into the proceedings with glee and probably a good stock of clothing. The camera-work and the use of locations has improved and it seems the budget was way higher this time around. All in all it makes for a good 90 minutes.""Zombis Nazis 2"" will be enjoyed by fans of the genre. If it could have had a better rhythm..."
" Dead Snow 2: The Sequel We Deserved
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,8,"Dead Snow was quite a good zombie film. It had a certain, modern low budget Evil Dead feel to it, with its blend of serious thrills and sprinkle of dark humor. It was a quick, fun, zombie film to watch with friends that delivered on the gore and action sequences. This was enough for me to want to watch its sequel directly after. Dead Snow 2 took me by surprise, building on its predecessor and completely surpassing it - which is what any good sequel should do. However, this is not just a good sequel, it is a great sequel, an awesome, totally irreverent comedy, horror, action film.Continuing immediately after the first film, our main protagonist is immediately thrown into the deep end. The film doesn't stop there, but goes completely all out by turning up on the crazy awesome factor by giving him powers through a zombie arm. If at this point you think this sounds idiotic and unbearable, then don't watch the movie. If you think this sounds idiotic and interesting, go ahead and proceed with watching it. You will not be disappointed with the course this movie takes.Along with the protagonist from the original film, comes new, clich√©d, but enjoyable characters that really add to the humor in the film. We have a bunch of zombie slaying nerds from the USA, a sloppy and idiotic cop and his men, a homose...I mean heterosexual museum attendant, a zombie sidekick and of course, the Nazi zombie army. All have their great scenes and lines to deliver throughout the movie, living up to the B-movie level of craziness in the same vein as the Evil Dead 2.So the plot and characters are all interesting and add to the overall quality of the film, but what really makes this film what it is, is the action scenes. Irreverent, bloody, vicious and hilarious, the creators have really pumped up the action in this movie, delivering on what all zombie movies should have - unique, gory, over-the-top kills, and this movie has it in spades.I laughed too many times throughout as some of the coolest, most inventive kills took place in front of my eyes, where absolutely nothing was sacred. Nobody was excluded from the rampage of the Nazi zombies as they tore through men, women and children to reach the inevitable climax to end all the craziness. Not only is it all good fun, but the filmmakers also made sure everything looked really good. The practical effects were all really well done, from the thick, splattering blood, to the explosions of grenades and tank shells. The zombies themselves looked really cool, the unique ones all having their own look. This is one of those films where you can tell everyone was having a great time and doing really great work because of it.Overall, if you're a fan of zombie films, watch it. If you're a fan of dark, irreverent comedy, watch it. If you're easily offended by perverse, non-politically correct content, avoid at all cost so you don't ruin this for others. If you're not though, you're gonna have an absolute blast.Dead Snow 2 is awesome. It builds off the first one and catapults itself into unique territory to stand apart from other zombie films. It's violent, hilarious and a quick 1 hour and 40 minutes, that caps off with a great ending. I want a Dead Snow 3, but honestly, this movie ends in a way where we don't need one, because it's already a perfectly fine way to finish it all off.Dead Snow 2 is the sequel fans of the original deserved.8/10. A must watch for all zombie film enthusiasts."
