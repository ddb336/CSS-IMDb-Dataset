" Pass
",2021-04-11 00:00:00,3,I could only take so much of this music and kids before I shut it off and started playing some faster and heavier music just to make up for what this film has. David Bowie's Let's Dance hit the spot.
" Purple humour, bloody gore and death metal!
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,8,"Great fun! If you want a straight horror don't watch this.... If you want a music comedy with a more childish lilt than ""Shaun Of The Dead"", you'll love it.Just a great laugh. Not to be taken too seriously. The style is pitched perfectly for what it is.Enjoy!"
" Stupid
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,2,"The writer is not an actual heavy metal music fan and so tried to write a joke movie (you know Bill & ted), but of course has no talent so it turned out unfunny.As for the music... well, don't quit your day job."
" Fun movie!
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,7,"I didn't expect all the blood, and severed limbs, and guts! It wasn't bad. If I saw this back when I was into metal, I would have appreciated it more."
" What??
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,3,"Are the reviewers comparing this to Evil Dead the director and his squeeze??
Surely must be.The music is not even heavy metal. It is Duran Duran with bad costumes.Weak and unfunny funny."
" It's Fine................
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,5,"Deathgasm is over the top campy film, that's not to say it's bad it can be at times very enjoyable. the directing and editing often reminded me of Edger Wright and clearly took from inspiration from Sam Raimi's Evil dead. The acting for the most part of solid a stand out for me was the Milo Cawthorne who our leading protagonist I thought he played him quite well and had good charisma. While I had my gripes with some of the technical aspect, and the fact that the demons are essentially just the the deadites and the sheets of music is totally just the Necronomicon but at it's core this movie is gory and over the top if that's your thing check this one out."

" Solid Joyride
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,6,"I guess many of those bad reviews are written by folks who take heavy metal music to serious - Deathgasm is for sure no masterpiece but still fun to watch. If you take the heavy metal and horror business not to serious and you like to enjoy movies like Tucker and Dale vs Evil, Jennifer's Body, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse and the like you may give Deathgasm a try. I at least was well entertained."
" MUST SEE COMEDY, HORROR, GORE AND MORE!!!
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,10,As a fan of metal and horror this movie was a match made in hell!!! This movie is fun from the moment you press play. Absolutely a unique horror comedy that never stops!!! A MUST SEE!!!
" A film for when your friends are losers, your uncle keeps trying to Christen you in your sleep, and you are drenched in your cousin's bodily fluids
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,7,"Brodie is into heavy metal, unfortunately his mum was into drugs due to a mental health issue. As a result he was sent to live with his very Christian Aunt and Uncle and their meathead jock of a child in Greypoint. Brodie does not really fit in locally, he is even bullied, it is not until he meats the mysterious Zakk that he really gets a friend. Together with Zakk and other outcast geeks Dion and Giles, Brodie forms a heavy metal band called Deathgasm. Brodie is even attracting attention from popular cool girl, Medina - somebody all the boys fancy - so his life is on the up. One night, Brodie and Zakk break into a building that's apparently where legendary heavy metal guitarist Rikki Daggers lives. They are not the only people breaking in though, in a panic Daggers gives the boys a record he has been holding onto and tells them to run. Daggers is then killed by a sharp dressed individual, a cultist who is trying to claim something that Daggers has. After escaping the boys are ""Rickrolled"" with the album, but Brodie finds some sheet music. Unbeknown to him the music is the 'Black Hymn', music so evil that it can unleash a demon called Aeloth, the ""Blind One"". Fortunately, Brodie is prevented from playing the music a couple of times. It is not until he deciphers the Latin wording that he begins to realise what exactly he has. As with all teenagers, drama is getting in the way of harmony. In a fit of anger one night, Brodie gets the band to play the music, and things are never the same again. People become possessed by Aeloth's minions who are attempting to kill everyone in town, preparing for the ""Blind One's"" arrival. At 3pm the most-evil person in town will be the vessel for Aeloth. Zakk decides he does not care for preventing the impending doom and takes a seat to watch the end of the World, Brodie, on the other hand, is up for the fight and manages to convince Zakk. Armed with sex toys, power tools and an array of objects they attempt to get the sheet music, in order to play it backwards - because of course, logically that would prevent the summoning. But Aeloth is powerful, on his side has a cult of demon worshippers who will stop at nothing to see their master freed, as well as the possessed minions doing Aeloth's bidding. It is up to Deathgasm, and popular cool girl Medina to stop the demon from unleashing an apocalypse.""Deathgasm"" was written and directed by New Zealander Jason Lei Howden. It stars Milo Cawthorne as Brodie, James Joshua Blake as Zakk and Kimberley Crossman as Medina. Running at 86 minutes, this film, originating from New Zealand, was made on a relative shoestring of a budgetBordering on horror, action, comedy, and horror - this B-Movie low budget film is really enjoyable. It is packed with the kind of tongue in cheek gore that you might expect to find in other New Zealand classics such as ""Bad Taste"" and ""Braindead"" - which is high praise. It is not just a goretastic film that looks awesome, this film also has a heart. It is a coming of age film in which Brodie finds himself and his place in life. He is taken away from his mother and being looked after by family that do not necessarily understand him or want him. He feels out of place in life and school. When he does make a friend, he starts coming out of his shell, but at same time he is unashamedly in love with his passion for loud and heavy music. Along his journey of discovery, he gets a girlfriend from the most unexpected sources, he meets a heavy metal legend, his friend betrays his for a girl, fights a demonic cult, fights the demon which the cult worship - and ultimately saves the world! As Brodie, Milo Cawthorne delivers a really solid performance. There were times I really felt connected to the character (maybe because of my own upbringing), and Cawthrone does a sterling job, being authentic and believable. Likewise, James Joshua Blake does really well as the catalyst for realisation and change in Brodie's life. Kimberley Crossman is sweet and gorgeous in a sickly way at the start of the film, but a performance grows as she changes too, accepting Brodie for what he is and finding happiness with that rather than a shallow existence. Research I have done told me that the characters and the scenario are all directly from director, Jason Lei Howden's, own experiences growing up.Well written with engaging characters that have a journey of discovery and personal development. Lots of fun for audiences who enjoy their films with darkness and a splattering of blood and guts. This is Tenacious D and Scott Pilgrim smashed together with Sam Raimi's Evil Dead and Peter Jackson's ""Braindead"". This is a very clever and entertaining film which makes fun of itself as much as the content it is dealing with. The film has lots of occult references, bad language, blood, guts, sexual and graphical content, and frontal nudity. I wouldn't recommend it to younger audiences. If however you like bad tongue in cheek humour, good horror, blood, guts, blasphemy, occult, heavy metal, and a film that is the polar opposite to the trashy ""American Pie"" style teenage/buddy movies of the 2000's, then in this you will find a gory but shiny hidden gem of a movie."
" Ok so it's not traditional heavy metal but who cares? a great descendant of Braindead's legacy
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,8,"This is a descendant of the legacy that Braindead left us. It's an indie horror film with relatively low budget (albeit some decent CGI here and there) and for the pure metalheads it's not exactly 100% true heavy metal warriors but who cares? If you focus too much on that you detract a lot from what's enjoyable. If the movie was taking itself seriously then I'd have that expectation but it's not.There is a lot of gore, some of it maybe unnecessary (according to some) but overall it was a refreshing change of pace from your typical American horror films and the Kiwi accent does add a touch of exotic to it.I enjoyed it. I didn't expect a lot out of it and it delivered so well done to the cast and crew.
Could it be better? sure. But I won't lose any sleep over that."
" Don't stick on to the Bad reviews
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,10,"Don't stick on to the Bad reviews! This Movie is Metal! Great and fun charakters. Gallons of blood. The Movie Takes the Mickey out of Metal. Some Beer, rockmusic and watch the Movie. You don't Need all the time Deep and serious Charakters or Epic storyline. Why so serious;)"
" Audiences will gasm
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,7,The constraints of low budget are felt and the acting is a bit stiff too but there's clearly passion at play here. The awesome gore and very Evil Dead-esque camework doesn't get tiring and the humor is pretty on point. Pure stupid fun.
" Brilliantly funny
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,10,"Funny, crazy, bloody. I watched this after Guns Akimbo because it was so good, and it didn't disappointed me. Man I hope you make more movies. Fan #1"
" Fun and gory
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,9,"I had a great time watching this! And among the gore, there is a bit of seriousness with brodys sense of being an outcast and how music can change that. Love the dildo scene! Who knew they would come handy in dire needs..."
" I Hated This Poppy Radio Friendly Slow Music
",2020-03-21 00:00:00,1,So this is what metal is? I now know. it is a slow and weird pop rock with ballads and goofy make up like Duran Duran and Suicide Squad. Wow I hated the piano player. I fell asleep. It was even poppier than spa music.
" Really good time!
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,7,It's not exactly Pride & Prejudice. It's messy and rough around the edges. But anyone who's ever been a metalhead will definitely enjoy this goofy little gorefest. Nice work!
" Great Movie and Awesome Debut From Jason Lei Howden
",2020-03-11 00:00:00,8,"Blood, guts, killing, metal, awesome and entertaining."
" Awesome B Move
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,9,"Feels like a late 80's B-move, but really well made. Fun ride."
" Blood, guts and death metal!! 😁
",2019-12-13 00:00:00,8,"If you like a good B movie, with blood guts and death metal this is a very entertaining film. Surprisingly well cast. Funny and gory. Don't turn off when the credits roll or you'll miss the extra scene."
" Since When Do Metal Bands Have Keyboards?
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,2,"Well clearly this is not a metal movie, the actors have no clue and the director is a wimp who listens to Nightwish.
The sorry pop band these kids put together is a catalyst for a joke demon and a town ravaged by the ghost of low budget flicks.
This film does not have heavy metal, does not have good music, does not have scares, does not show a single rocking girl and is stupid. This film reinforces the worst cliches and stereotypes people have about metal."
" Awesome!
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,9,"This is by far the best demon/zombie movie ever. Watching them kill ""zombies' with dildos and vibrators may be the best thing I have ever seen. But there is one thing I don't understand. Was this supposed to take place in the 90s? The girls walks around with a Disc Man and all the cds and t-shirts that we see are from the 90s. They even have cassettes. It's not a problem but some explanation would have been nice. This is a must see."
" Stupid Story, Stupid Characters and Very Stupid Music
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,2,I guess the director is auditioning to direct a Marvel movie. Like Marvel has made a joke out of superheroes this film makes a joke out of heavy metal. Listen to the music (if you want to call it that) and nice it is as hard and heavy as Drake.
" Rubbish!
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,2,"I thought it is a horror movie with heavy metal. Instead I got:A weak wimpy band that has less speed and heaviness than Bruce Springsteen (and has as many keyboardists)A juvenile joke-ridden sarcastic film
the horror parts were not horrific and I was not scared"
" Metalocalypse meets Dead Alive/Brain Dead
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,7,"Deathgasm is a splatter comedy about a metal band that plays a riff that turns people into demons. Being a metalhead myself, I found that the people who made the film don't really understand the subculture and rely heavily on stereotypes. Considering this is just campy fun and not too be taken too seriously, it did'nt bother me much. Plus , most metal fans that I know are horror fans too and this film is very influenced by The Evil Dead series as well as Peter Jackson gore classics Dead Alive and Bad Taste. I would not put this in the same class as the aforementioned classics, but I did enjoy it and delivers huge on gore with extreme metal as a backdrop. Deathgasm is a fun little horror flick with its tongue firmly planted in cheek and is good entertainment."
" 10/10
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,10,Deathgasm is better than Shrek 2. Having washed both I thoroughly enjoyed watching deathgasm more than Shrek 2.
" It is supposed to be a metal horror
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,3,But the music was weak and laden with synthesizers. It was like a pop band with get-up and of course the jokes were juvenile. I guess this is a joke like Baby'metal' or something.
" Corney
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,5,It was ok not my favorite... it had a cheesy 80s vibe which I get it was meant but 80s vibe is overly done... had some funny moments but I've seen better...
" I lived this life
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,7,"Who knew that one of the best movies about Satanic panic and heavy metal would be made in 2015 and in the country of New Zealand? Seriously - a movie supremely influenced by D&D, Ozzy and Trick or Treat made decades later? All hail Sammi Curr. And all hail Rikki Daggers.Brodie is a misfit kid who finds joy in one place: metal. His life pretty much sucks: his dad is dead, his mom's in an insane asylum and he's stuck living with Christian relatives in a small town where no one understands him but his geeky friends Dion and Giles. Soon, however, he meets Zakk and they form a band called DETHGASM. Before you know it, even the hottest girl in school - Medina - is interested in him.Brodie and Zakk find the hidden home of Rikki Daggers, a musician who disappeared after one classic album. They find him hiding out from a cult who soon catches up to him and slices his throat. However, the boys have already left with a copy of The Black Hymn, which Brodie thinks can help him gain the power he needs to defeat bullies. Oh, if it were only that easy. The band has invoked the demon Aeloth, who is now possessing the town and will arrive at 3 AM to take over the body of the most evil person in town.Can the power of metal and friendship defeat a town of demons? Can two friends not let a hot girl come between them? Will heads blow up? How do sex toys do as weapons against hellspawn?This is a movie that gets metal right from the guy, even including a dead on parody of Immortal's video for ""Call of the Wintermoon."" It's also an effective remake of Evil Dead, with perhaps even more blood, if that's possible. This one comes more than recommended. I lived this life. I feel this movie."
" Great movie, I needed this.
",2019-04-05 00:00:00,10,"I found Deathgasm thoroughly entertaining.
Funnest movie I've seen in a while. The music and the gore takes me back to my younger years. Kinda reminds me is Deicide's Homage to Satan video."
" This Is One I'm Glad I Took A Chance On
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,7,"This was a fun movie. It is horror comedy but it doesn't overdo it so it's not what I consider to be cheesy and it has a good bit of blood in it. The story was a bit vague in some of the details but it wasn't so bad that it took away from my enjoying the film. If something was a bit cheesy, I'd have to say it was some of the special effects but once again, they weren't that bad. I liked it so I say give it a go."
" Fun but flawed ......these aren't metalheads!?
",2019-03-19 00:00:00,6,"Love the gore. Reminds me of Bad Taste, Brain Dead from Pete Jackson's early works.As a metalhead and musician myself I wanted to see this when first heard about it because was supposed to be a comedy 'metal' horror.
Sadly it just does as most metal band films and takes to piss out of metalheads by painting them as lonely loser idiots with zero sense and plays up to all the incorrect stereotypes. I was hoping that it would show metalheads in a better light but all It does is enforce the crap image most non metalheads think we are.
I was hoping for a film that had cool likable leads that you could root for, these are pathetic cheesey imitations and not really likable at all. Especially that selfish idiot bass player.
The director clearly doesn't have a grasp on metal or being in a band. But.......
All that aside it's still a fun watch and has some funny good gore moments.
Added to collection.
It just could have been so much better."
" Hilarious Horror/Comedy
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,9,"This was a film that I heard about when I first got into listening into horror movie podcasts. I added it to a list of films to see and when one of my favorite podcasts picked it as their Movie Club for February of 2019, I was excited to finally check it out. The official synopsis is two teenage boys unwittingly summon an ancient evil entity known as The Blind One by delving into black magic while trying to escape their mundane lives.We kick off this film getting to know the characters. Our star is Brodie (Milo Cawthrone). He is forced to live with his Uncle Albert (Colin Moy), Aunt Mary (Jodie Rimmer) and his cousin David (Nick Hoskins-Smith) when is mother is arrested and sent to a mental hospital. They are normal, good Christian family, but this poses a problem as Brodie is a metal head. They immediately clash and this doesn't help that David is a bully.Life is a hard adjustment as he is the new guy at school and his only two friends are Dion (Sam Berkley) and Giles (Daniel Cresswell). They are nerds who play Dungeons and Dragons. Things do change when Brodie goes to a local record shop and meets another metal head, Zakk (James Blake). They two become fast friends and decide to start a band.David's girlfriend is Medina (Kimberly Crossman). She has lost interest in him, due to being a jerk and has taken interest in Brodie. The problem though is that he has low self-esteem and the bullying by David doesn't help. She is still nice to him and trying to get to know him. He does give her a metal CD to introduce her into what he likes.Zakk one day takes Brodie to a run down house and they break in. Rumor has it there is a metal legend that is hiding out there, the lead singer of a band known as Haxan's Sword. They do find him there, looking rough and clutching a record. They take it from him and he wakes up. A man pulls up and the singer gives them the record, telling them to keep it from the cult.They find inside it sheet music. There is a Latin title that Brodie later translate to summon the demon king and to obtain power and prosperity. He gets his band, Deathgasm, to play it. The problem is that it opens up the gates of hell and anyone in earshot is now possessed. Those they kill then become possessed as well. It is their job to close the gates before it is too late.I want to lead off this review that I had a blast with this one. I do like some metal, but I'm far being a metal head. The references that are used from this group are great. They do a fantastic job of incorporating this and it is even great to see Medina not necessarily understanding yet, but really doing what she can to try. I like that she is showing interest in what Brodie's into to connect with him. It is quite interesting in that she is the gorgeous one. We normally see this the other way around.Something that I really was struck by was how much this film felt like The Evil Dead. We have people being possessed by demons and there's a chainsaw in this film too. This film is also a comedy, which the first film didn't intentionally have but films later in the series went to. Another reference I liked was to the band Haxan's Sword. Now I am looking into the history of horror and know that the film Häxan was a dark, silent era film that was taken from an inquisitor's book. It actually tells the history of possession and demons throughout history, which I give the film props for doing its homework.I don't think all of the comedy landed, but quite a bit did. I was literally laughing out loud by myself, which I will give any film credit if you can get me to do. I do wonder if a second viewing if it will all stand up.The film actually carries some deeper underlying messages that I was onboard for. We have the issue of bullying in school. I like that they made the hot girl standing up to her boyfriend, who thinks it is a fun thing to do. I really felt for Brodie, even though I was never really bullied myself. The helplessness he experiences was sad and that he turned to black magic to try to fix it. Zakk doesn't help the situation, but he also seems to have some deep underlying issues that seem to stem from his home life. For being a fun horror comedy, it does have some deeper aspects to it that I really dug.Pacing for this film is really good as well. Part of that is the 86 minute run time and we don't get a lot of filler. It keeps the film moving at a good pace. The characters are introduced well, it doesn't take too long to get to the real horror aspects of the film and we also get some good interactions between the humans and those that are possessed. I thought the ending was good and fitting for what the film was going for as well.There was an aspect of this cult that I thought wasn't fully explored. I do like the idea of this and wouldn't be surprised if there are groups out there like this. They are shown fairly early on and then disappear for long stretches. I do think they could have added a bit more for them and it wouldn't make the film that much longer. Just something I noticed and could have used more of.This brings me to acting for the film. I thought that Cawthrone was solid as the lead. He really portrays someone who is down on himself and those around him aren't helping. His growth was good into the hero as well. I like that Crossman is also solid and really wants to be there for him. She is gorgeous as well, but her acting was good. Blake was solid as a secret jerk in the film. He really pissed me off, so I have to give credit to him for that, he sparked a reaction from me. I do like the redemption of his character at the end, as it does show some growth. The rest of the cast I thought rounded out the film for what was needed as well.Effects for the film were pretty solid as well. I thought all of the practical effects looked great. There is quite a bit of blood and gore, which a film like this definitely benefits from. I love the creativity they used with weapons in this film and the ones they combine together. There is even a dildo fight in the film against of the demons which was hilarious. The look of the demons was solid as well. I did have issues with most of the CGI effects though. They don't look great and I'm glad they didn't use too much there. I didn't even mind the effects when introducing characters though, I know some will have problems there. The film is shot beautifully as well.This then brings me to the soundtrack. As I said, I'm not a huge metal fan, but I don't mind it. I thought the score for the film was perfect for what they were going for. I do think metal really has its place in horror and this film definitely uses it to the fullest in that aspect. It really fit for what they were going for and during some of the more action packed scenes, it really got me going.Now with that said, this film was a big surprise for me how much I liked it. I came in knowing as little as I could and had a lot of fun. This isn't a new concept, but they did put their own twist on it, which I really like. I thought the underlying issues that are explored are good and really relevant today. The acting was good in my opinion, as were the practical effects and the score. The CGI I wasn't a fan of. The pacing is really good as well. There were some minor issues that I had with the film, but had a lot of fun this first time around. I would be curious to see how it holds up with a second viewing. I found this to be a really good film."
" Pure Metal Awesomeness
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,9,"Deathgasm is a New Zealand horror comedy about Brodie, a metalhead who forms a metal band that accidentally summons a demon that turns civilians into bloodthirsty demons. First, let's talk about the good: the gore is all done with practical effects, and it's fantastic.The deaths are all extremely creative and gory, and should please even the strongest gorehounds. The characters are all likable and serve a purpose in the film. The cast is also excellent. And finally, the film is well shot and the soundtrack is great. Now, onto the bad: I really have only one problem, which is the villain. The main demon, Aeloth, shows up at the end, and he looks pretty bad. His face looks like a rubber mask, which is a shame considering how all of the other effects look great. So yeah, that's my review of Deathgasm, a film I highly recommend."
" Best..Movie...EVER!
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,10,Headline says it all... but the movie speaks for itself.
" Amusing, thoroughly tacky horror/parody of metal music
",2018-06-05 00:00:00,7,"RELEASED IN 2015 and written & directed by Jason Lei Howden, ""Deathgasm"" is a horror/comedy about a group of teens in Auckland, New Zealand, who start an extreme metal band named Deathgasm and inadvertently unleash dark forces that possess the nearby populace.""Deathgasm"" combines elements of ""Evil Dead II"" (1987), ""Trick or Treat"" (1986) and ""Braindead"" aka ""Dead Alive"" (1992). Amidst the sometimes profane and tasteless happenings, there are moments of masterful hilarity (e.g. the Peter Criss joke and the black metal photo op in the woods), including black comedy, naturally.Numerous seminal bands are acknowledged throughout, some of which are worthy of the recognition and some not so worthy: Death, Judas Priest, Bathory, Slayer, GWAR, Cannibal Crap, ad nauseam. (Even Def Leppard is noted, which some might find odd, but it reveals the open mindedness of Howden; besides, they were definitely a metal band during their first few albums, albeit not extreme metal). Florida's Trivium is curiously referenced throughout the flick, which tells me they're a big hit in New Zealand ('cause they ain't all that big in the USA, although they're certainly a formidable metal act).The band's name, Deathgasm, is presumably an homage to Wargasm and Death or Death Angel. The main protagonist, Brodie (Milo Cawthorne), looks like a cross between a young Alice Cooper and Keith Deen, the vocalist of Holy Terror (R.I.P.) while his buddy, Zakk (James Blake), resembles a pasty version of Conan the Barbarian. Kimberley Crossman is cute, curvy and formidable as the blonde babe, but the camera rarely zeroes-in on her beauty, unfortunately.There's the stereotypical myth that Christianity and Christians are opposed to metal, but Black Sabbath started the genre and they had overtly pro-Christian songs, like ""After Forever"" and ""War Pigs."" If you doubt that, just read the lyrics. Or how about the ending of ""Hallowed Be Thy Name""? Not to mention that there are scores of kick-axx metal bands that have espoused biblical themes in a positive sense, like Cage, Trouble, Megadeth, W.A.S.P., Saint, Tourniquet, Bride, Saviour Machine, Living Sacrifice, Antestor, Zao, Seventh Angel, Theocracy, Barnabas, Believer, Overkill, Deadly Blessing, Avenged Sevenfold, Meliah Rage and (of course) Stryper. Notice, by the way, that I didn't say they were all ""Christian bands,"" just that they have all blatantly espoused biblical themes on occasion. Needless to say, the idea that metal is intrinsically anti-God is laughable. Get real. Christianity has been part of the genre since day one.The accents are kinda thick so you might want to use the subtitles if you live outside of New Zealand and Australia.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 26 minutes and was shot entirely in west Auckland. The soundtrack features several New Zealand bands unknown outside of the local scene.GRADE: B"
" YOU AXING FOR THIS
",2018-05-04 00:00:00,8,"In Auckland, New Zealand, two metal heads discover a manuscript to summon the King of The Demons. Having done that, they then try to reverse it. While the music is metal, I must question their values as true metal heads. They dis Poison, while wearing KISS make-up. They summon a demon and then panic and try to get rid of the demon. What real metal heads would try to get rid of a demon and wear KISS style make-up?The film has numerous comic elements as our ""Brothers in Steel"" have good one liners and situational dialogue.

" AMAZING!
",2018-04-25 00:00:00,7,"I loved this movie! A light-hearted, gore-fest for metal heads! Solid script and story, excellent effects, funny, just a little scary- perfect for the genre.If you do not like Metal (and ok, Im trying not to judge and failing) dont even bother. This movie was not made for you so dont waste your time watching it, or ours by writing a pitiful review afterwards."
" Your parents did warn you that heavy metal can be dangerous
",2018-04-05 00:00:00,7,"Comedy Horrors are hard to take seriously in the means that most of them are spoofs, parodies or just plain silly. The New Zealand film industry has taken off quite a bit in recent years with the likes of Taika Waititi or James Napier Robertson, director Jason Lei Howden makes his own entrance within this new wave with his directorial debut ""Deathgasm"".""Deathgasm"" is about Brodie, a heavy metal loving teenager who tries to cope with his new life after moving in with overly orthodox Christian uncle, since his mother had been institutionalized. His high school life is tough, being treated like an outcast and is more or less forced to befriend nerds. Shortly after they form a heavy metal band called ""Deathgasm"" and one of his new acquaintances tells him about a famous metal musician Rikki Daggers, who has been hiding from society in a nearby abandoned house. They search the place and find sheets of music hidden inside a record. Naturally, they go on and play the notes from the sheets with the whole band, unknowingly summoning an ancient evil called ""The Blind one"". At this point, the fun begins as they try to preventing the demon's resurrection.The premise is interesting by which I mean that you don't often see comedies revolving around heavy metal (and not emo) that are actually well-intended. The imaginative main character is someone that you could relate too, even for someone who doesn't necessarily enjoy that musical genre. The acting is alright, nothing too outstanding but enjoyable nonetheless.The movie is faced-paced with quick cuts and sleek filming style like Guy Ritchie or Paul Greengrass in ""The Bourne Trilogy"", topping it all off with the delightful New Zealand accent just makes it even greater.Some jokes and situations were witty and originals while others were just strange and immature, reminding me of ""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"".""Deathgasm"" is more than a B-Horror film, it's actually part-entertaining part-quality and it must definitely not be overlooked by fans of the horror genre. ""Deathgasm"" works well when watched with a small group of friends."
" Rousing and truly enjoyable effort
",2018-02-21 00:00:00,10,"After moving to a quiet small-town, a metal-loving teen and his new bandmates inadvertently release a series of Satanic demons after taking a passage from a book on devil-worshipping to use in their lyrics and must use their arcane knowledge of the black arts from the music to stop them.This was nothing short of an absolute blast. Among the many numerous enjoyable qualities with this one is the just utter love and respect given to the metal genre throughout here. Not only does it get a lot of the behavioral qualities and characteristics about the fans down completely, but it manages to get the genres' different quirks and eccentricities pretty consistent as well with the use of arcane lore and different symbolism involved with the genre that gets mentioned not only in the dialog but so many other areas of the film. Since that ties into how the demons are released with the song and their plan to finally reverse the whole process which all comes from the music itself, there's a plenty of heavy metal fun to be had within here. As well, there's also the really enjoyable comedy to be found which is nearly gut-busting not only in their interactions with each other but also the general situation that's being unleashed here. From brief little interludes that feature plenty of laughs to their snarky comments to each other and the truly enjoyable moment where the corpse-paint-bedecked kid and the bright cheerleader-style normal girl are sitting on a park bench in the middle of the day eating ice-cream together discussing the genre creates an utterly memorable image as well as being genuinely hilarious. Still, the fact that as a true horror film this one provides plenty to like here with the fun and enjoyable tale here with the demon infestation slowly taking over the town and providing this with plenty of ferocious action throughout here with the townspeople slowly coming into the realization of what's happening. The brief spurts showing the crazed demons in the town makes for some stellar moments here, and with high-energy sequences here from the battle with the possessed parents using their secret sex-toys to the dismemberments of the townspeople out in the street while fleeing to safety all giving this one great make-up work on the demons, tons of ingenuity with their homemade weapons and a smattering of bloody gore there are plenty of reasons to love this one. The one downfall is that the relationships within the band don't seem realistic, but it's a minor inconsequential quibble.Rated Unrated/R: Extreme Graphic Language, Extreme Graphic Violence, Nudity and minor drug use."
" meh
",2018-02-13 00:00:00,5,"It has some good effects. the humor can be enjoyable if you get drunk or stay awake for a few days with some friends. Other than that this movie doesn't have much going for it. The characters aren't very interesting, I feel like I have seen all of these characters before in several different movies. The plot is so strange. After watching the movie I didn't know if it was supposed to be a parody, regular horror film with dark juvenile humor, or a christian film trying to tell it's viewers that metal is bad."
" I'm being nice for giving this a 4 star
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,4,"I felt like this movie was concocted in the basement of a teenage stoner-rock group. So much gore...such crude jokes that didn't land...the acting was piss poor and there were characters who had life threatening injuries that suddenly healed in the next scene. Ridiculous waste of time. I would give this a 2 star but it did hold my interest, whether I want to admit it or not."

" Horror, comedy, gore & metal
",2017-10-04 00:00:00,7,"A group of small town misfits form a heavy metal band and unwittingly unleash a demon through their music. Fantastic combination of horror, comedy, gore and heavy metal from first time New Zealand writer and director Jason Lei Howden. His passion for both horror and metal help make this such an enjoyable movie. Good acting & special effects, which provide gore by the bucket load, my only quibble was that I had a job at times to understand what was being said by some of the possessed. Overall a great, fun ride. And watch out for the post credits scene."
" Probably one of the best movies ever made! That's only half-sarcasm too!
",2017-09-01 00:00:00,10,"I cannot believe I just discovered this gem! Buckets of gore? Zombies? References to cult horror films? Hot chicks? A soundtrack comprised of nothing but heavy metal songs? Sign me up! Deathgasm is one of the most badass and hilarious films I've seen in a long time but I'm very glad I eventually got around to seeing it. One thing I enjoyed a lot about the film was the fact that this film had REAL heavy metal. Most movies just use, like, AC/DC or Quiet Riot, thinking that pop crap is heavy metal. I remember that awful movie Rock Of Ages with Tom Cruise that was about bringing back heavy metal, but every single song used in the film was a radio pop glam rock song. If you're gonna do a film about 80's metal, talk about Slayer or Megadeth or Obituary or something, y'know, ACTUAL METAL, not Mr Big, Ratt, and Warrant. This film not only gets the metal soundtrack right, but goes above and beyond; we get grindcore, black metal, sludge metal, doom metal, progressive metal, and a bunch of really cool stuff. I don't think I've ever heard a true metal soundtrack like this in any film! The characters also reference metal nonstop, but again, they reference REAL metal and not radio pop tracks by Whitesnake. One character wears a Death shirt the entire film, and I don't think I've ever, EVER seen Death ever referenced in a movie before. Other bands like Cannibal Corpse, Terrorizer, Darkthrone, Edge Of Sanity, Deicide, Burzum, Opeth, Judas Priest, Slayer, Witchfinder General, Pestilence, Obituary, Evile, and countless more are referenced in the movie on shirts, posters, CD covers, or just through character conversation. They even reference An*l C*nt, freaking An*l C*nt of all bands! No stone went unturned in this film! So, this film could've been awful but I still would've given it a 10/10 just for getting the metal references right...but good thing this film is actually really good! The plot is a homage to films like Evil Dead 2 and Dead Alive, and several references to classic goresploitation horror films are made, which is also a treat. The gore is abundant and very well done, and one scene involving intestines actually genuinely grossed me out, which never happens to me nowadays! Most of all, I really enjoyed the characters and I related to Brody, the main character, in practically every way. I really wanted him to succeed the entire time. The film could've just been a good indie film about a group of nobody's forming a death metal band in their small town, but the film throws in satanism, zombies, the apocalypse, and a bunch of other really gory cool stuff to make this the perfect film for a nut like me! It's well directed, well written, well acted, has good special effects, a killer soundtrack, and is overall very well done. If you're a TRUE metalhead or gorehound, I recommend checking this gem ASAP!"
" A well-made dark comedy
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,7,"The movie started off great, but the climax was well... not that great(kinda sucked, but not horrible). But can't complain, since it's a dark comedy intended to purely entertain and that part it does well. Overall, a pretty good dark comedy, that you'll enjoy even more if you are a metal lover(I am). Certainly worth watching."
" Worst Movie? You are Stupid!
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,10,"You think this is stupid and the worst, then you must love Troll 2 then. Dumb people should stay in their own group. Should never be invited to the party. Keep your dumb comments to yourself. This is better than what you call better than this. Almost all PG-13 are lame and tame to what real horror movies like this does.Stick with your teeny boppers and be that childish jerk off teenager lover of wanna be PG-13 horror movies that are more of a thriller that can't handle to be a rate R or unrated movie. So many lame people out there to put down better movies and say that better movies are trash, and the trash is what they watch instead, and they praise that instead.The real dummies come on this site to review movies and can't use grammar well, or even type like they are toddlers to give their own opinion of a movie. Stick to your trash and I will enjoy my better movies that you watch anytime. As for gore, it is the best gore movie out there. Anyone that can't handle should of never watched it in the first place. Dummies!Funny, this is one of the best mixed comedy and horror together. So kiss off! Just like the people that TCITW movie. Either love or hate movie, but way too many haters out there. Oh well, if I ever ran into someone that hated this kind of movie, they would never be talked to or recognized as a person at all. Unless, it is my family, then I can forgive them.People I do not at all, won't bother at all to even acknowledge. So keep to yourself. I actually love Metalcore but this is an awesome movie to watch. I love Dead Alive too. So just stick with tame, dummies."
" Overrated as hell
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,3,"This film really sucks, many people who enjoy metal music feel really anxious to see this film, but it was awful, it just has 5 or 6 funny scenes, the humor is silly, nothing interesting, just a waste of time, most of the people who defends this film it's cuz they are""Metalheads"" , me too, but that doesn't mean that because i love metal music, it's a good film, the worst of 2015, overrated"
" Awesome :D
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,9,"While listening to some random metal on YouTube I ran into the soundtrack for this movie and a bunch of thrilled comments about it. Usually, when I run into some movie I want to see, I just add it to IMDb watch-list and one day it may be its turn... This time I could not wait. Whatever I had to do could wait for a few hours and a few minutes later I was in for a crazy ride.A high-school metal-head moves into a little puritan town. Greeted by rejection, he falls in love with the best chick in the school, meets the only other metal-head, they start a band (you guess - Deathgasm), find an ancient notes with Latin text, take them as their new song and by playing them they open a portal for a demon king to take over the Earth. And the fun begins...As much as I could not wait to see it, I did not expect anything from it, because it is a New Zealand low-budget horror comedy made by a bunch of no-names. Movie exceeds all possible expectations. Although it is director's low-budget debut, this movie is better than almost everything I saw in the genre so far. The story is interesting, characters are caricatured but yet realistic and actors carry their roles very well and you'll fall in love with them from the start. Effects and overall production are above every expectation for a low-budget movie, and directing and camera have some very interesting moments. The movie is extremely gory and explicit, impregnate with very twisted and sick humor and you get to listen to good metal from the beginning to the end. Mandatory for all gore lovers and metal-heads.9/10"
" Heavy Metal Zombies From New Zealand
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,9,"It's your usual boy meets girl, boy accidentally summons evil entity movie, but super funny and gory. Made in New Zealand and pokes fun at metal heads and really hits the mark.If you enjoyed such horror/comedy hybrids as Scouts Guide To the Zombie Apocalypse or Freaks of Nature, then you will surely find lots to like about Deathgasm. It was a recommendation by a fellow member of the now-deceased Horror message board on here, never would have sought it out or heard about it otherwise.Never really considered a dildo as a viable weapon against zombies...until now! Plenty of laughs and well done gore, check it out!"
