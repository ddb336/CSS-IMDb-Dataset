" Nihilistic, uninspired, and predictable.
",2021-04-06 00:00:00,1,"Seth believes in absolutely nothing, and it shows. This is a man who seemingly only gets his kicks from making the viewer's lip curl in disgust. Vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, this is the film equivalent of a teenage boy who just learned the F word. Morality aside, the movie is cringeworthy, hard to watch garbage. Don't even watch it ironically."
" Watched it With a Grin
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,10,"For 4 yrs my wife has stopped me from watching this movie. One day she wasn't home and with a grin on my face I picked up the remote and entered a trance. She was right not to let me watch it. I hate it when she is right. Aside from the fact this film is offensive, it is smart and funny as hell. That's all I need to love a movie. I now have a mission, to try to remember all the movies she would not let me watch over the years."
" Funny and racist
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,5,I don't mind racist jokes for the purpose of entertainment. While some of the jokes in this movie were funny and reflected so well on the real world - it had its shortcomings. Sometimes I felt annoyed why the stereotypes were only on non-white people while there was nothing racist against white people - a more equal racist movie would've been better and less cringe.
" YALL BOY KARL LIKES THIS
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,10,"-My name is Karl-
I liked when the taco when the taco made the airhorn noise, sausege party
The movie is an absolute masterpiece, it's up with all the contenders like Endgame, Avatar, and Titanic. Absolutely beautiful.
This was fire like so fire.
The story of this piece is so immaculate and amazing to the point where I saw the light of this film before the naughty juice. The absolute balls the man had on his face to make this was like giving birth to African children then buying crack from them an hour later. I can recommend this work of art to anyone with enough stage 3 leukemia to watch this before the die. Truly a work of the shungite stones."
" Weird Perversion
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,1,"Seriously? or even not seriously. This film comes from a depraved mind. He/they should straighten up their lifestyle. Think about it!
If this came from a genuine place, then maybe if it were funny it would be worthwhile.
But this! No
Indeed no"
" more than words
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,10,Later south park i didn!t watch any production as well as that one criticizes whole existence matter.who doesn't like this movie go and believe in all lies firmly.
" funny but vulgar
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,5,"It was pretty funny but a bit out there towards the end, especially the last scene. overall just a bit weird but if you're into that kinda thing then sure you should watch it. it's just very profane and inappropriate."
" Unbelievably bad
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,1,"I had the terrible experience of seeing this in the theater on a first date no less as the movie we were going to see we were late for. This movie is stupid, immature, not funny and was incredibly loud. My date fell asleep even with the speakers blaring. That's how bad it was. Another Seth Rogen dud."
" Terrible
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,2,"This is the definition on unfunny trash. Lazy writing and dumb ""jokes"". Also they treated the animators badly"
" This movie saved me.
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,6,"Ok so I know this sounds ridiculous, but I was born in the one of the most depressingly horrible environments, the island of Kalymnos. I was humiliated and bullied as a kid. THIS MOVIE SAVED ME. The amount of emotional support I got from watching this modern masterpiece made me cry about 3 times. Just trying to understand the work of genius that is 2016s ""Sausage Party"" has made me ascend on a spiritual level. I am no longer the same weak kid I was 4 years ago. I recommend it to every single person , no matter the circumstances. I missed my grandma's funeral just to rewatch it and I gotta say I do not care about that woman anymore, because sausage party was worth it. I don't care that my mother no longer speaks to me, for I am no longer bound by the uncertainties of modern life. I am a God, one that cannot be identified by any religion. my powers are beyond your human understanding. You may worship me or even better, join me, by watching this astounding gift to humanity.Overall, a pretty average watch, I would say it is a fairly decent adult animated film, definitely got a few laughs and chuckles out of this. However it often relies on a very childish type of humor, which contradicts it's adult themes pretty badly. 6/10"
" Why did I give this film a 6/10?
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,8,"Sausage Party is the 1st CGI-Animated R-Rated film to ever exist in the history of cinema. However, many parents mistake it as a kids movie. But a trailer for this movie played during a screening of Finding Dory (2016). However, I watched the movie 2 times, & I liked it. But wouldn't recommend it to anyone, because I was concerned that some of my friends may not like it.But now that I'm over 18, I started to love it. A majority of my friends are 18, & older now. So I decided to start to recommend the film to other people, giving the film an 8/10. The reason for this recommendation, is because they may think it's funny, & that they would have a good laugh while watching it.PLEASE NOTE: If you wanna watch this movie, be warned that the content you will find in this movie has a lot of mature content. But it may look like a kids movie.OVERALL: 8/10"
" creative, looks amazing, high?
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,10,"Very creative, great characters, amazing animations, and lighting. they created a very unique world. but the questions is"" where they high? :D"
" Adult Animated Comedy
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,6,"Ever wondered what a head-on collision between Chicken Run & Animal Farm would look like? Find out the answer here. It even invents a new genre - supermarket satire. After a strong opening the middle goes a bit cuckoo as it attempts to introduce a plot most of which it doesn't need, but the finish is well worth a watch"
" All that bad reviews made me like it more
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,7,That movie is sure not made for everybody.If your alergic to vulgarity or sexual referring just don't watch it but if you 'r ok with that just enjoy some trashi jokes made to relax. important: Made for adults
" Surprising Hilarious Adult animated film
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,10,"My husband and i watched this after years of thinking it was weird and stupid. However we were Very Pleasantly surprised at how comical and witty this movie was. Honestly by the end of it we were both cracking up with all the comments the foods kept making. It was a very entertaining ride that we totally misjudged initially. Obviously when we saw it four years ago we were like everyone else thinking it was really weird and gross, but now it was hilarious and so many interesting characters. I know some people will disagree with my review because they thought the movie was bad or weird. I dont care,, i enjoyed this movie every second of it. Yes its not made for kids but for adults with a sense of humor, totally watch it. xD"
" Clever, crude and superb
",2020-11-13 00:00:00,10,"3rd time viewing this and gets funnier every time. It's crude, rude and bizarre, but it's an incredibly clever and well made adult animated comedy. It's mostly based in a supermarket, where all the ingredients come to life and are all vying to get to the ""great beyond"" which is supposedly heaven for them. This is where the shoppers pick up the ingredients and take them home. It follows the story of each character trying to figure out the truth and the real reasoning as to why the ingredients are taken away, but the result is a hilarious comedy full of crude jokes, swearing galore and superb hidden messages galore. The story is excellent. The characters fantastic and it's just so witty full of pop culture. If you blink, you will miss some of the intelligent and subtle comparisons to real life. It really is brilliant viewing. Kick back, chill and get ready to laugh out loud. If you went an Oscar winner, then Sausage Party isn't the film, but if you want a film to make you laugh, then this one is highly recommended"
" The only scenes worth watching were in the trailer
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,2,"Go read a book and stop staring at screens.
Seth Rogan just go back to smoking weed maybe try different creative endeavors cuz ur movies suck sorry"
" Too far into the lewd territory for my own liking - I didn't hate it though
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,6,"Those scenes at the end... they really went for it!'Sausage Party' is as dumb a film as you'll find, it's purely nonsensical and extremely crass at times - pretty stereotypical too. Even with that being true, it does have some amusing gags in there; it got a few laughs out of me. It's uneasy, yet somewhat refreshing, to see an animated film be so raunchy. They do take it too far though, especially at the conclusion.Seth Rogen is the lead as Frank, he is exactly what you'd expect from a Rogen character; drugs et al. There are a number of other well-known names, from James Franco to Salma Hayek to Jonah Hill to Kristen Wiig. I can't say any of them stand out in my memory, admittedly. Animation-wise I found it fine.I commend them for going the full distance with this, but that probably harms the film in the long run. Adult animated films definitely have an open market and it would be cool to see it rise, but this film takes it too far into the lewd territory for my own liking - I didn't hate it though."
" The worst film I have ever seen
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,1,"Me and my friends watched this, I dont remember why, but not a single one of us laughed a single time. It's not funny, just a bunch of sex jokes, racial stereotypes, and reference humor, none of it is clever and I'm surprised I say through the whole thing. The animation is ugly, I hated looking at it, and the story is not interesting enough for me to care. This is definitely my least favorite movie.If a film has to resort to jokes like the ones seen in this one, then they couldn't think of any good jokes."
" Disappointing
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,1,"Disappointing. Typical seth rogen humor, written on sophistication level of a 7th grader.
could have been fun date nigh or young adult movie, but excessive and unnecessary language and sexual references ruined it."
" It's traumatic
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,5,This movie was start with unique perspective. I like how they make satire for religions. Even I still can accept the atheism subtance in here. This movie actually enjoyable until they messed up at the ending.
" Hilarious
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,10,"This film is a masterpiece, there are so many underlying themes that it addresses and hits the nail on the head. I imagine people are just offended because it delivers a truth that they find uncomfortable. I think the film starts off a little slow for the first 10-15 mins or so, but it all comes together in a very intelligent way. The ending was absolutely hilarious, i was rolling around in tears."
" Worst film ever
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,1,"This film made me not laugh the rest of the day thats how unfunny this is a couple of the ideas are kinda funny but it is not preformed well at all this isn't even stupid funny like adult swim shows or other obsurd comedies I cannot see the appeal for anyone to like this film Its not even so bad its good it just stinks I know comedy is subjective but this is objective unfunny it is painful to watch and has little redeeming quality and it even has decent animation but that's the only good thing about the film the people who made it where all high while writing it. This tries to be like a adult swin show or something but atleast adult swim shows are atleast funny sometimes a lot of them are very funny but this is garbage I hate it and I cannot understand how anyone could like this film
I would rather die the most painful death than watch this film again"
" Sausage Party (2016)
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,8,"It may not be as funny as some, I included, may have hoped- but what Sausage Party lacks in comedy, is made up in worldbuilding and cleverness- and a surprisingly deep moral message deep down inside. I did expect a bit more of this flick to be honest, expecting it was a foulmouthed comedy in the glorious form of CGI animation. Granted, there are many many scenes in this film that are absolutely outrageous, but it feels forced at times, and to have no point than to just show how far they are willing to go to reach the point of uncomfort. I chuckled a few times throughout this film, but never did I laugh like I expected to, and I found that to be the most disappointing flaw the film had to offer. Besides that, I did end up enjoying this raunchy little flick. It's animation is nothing special, but it's interesting and entertaining to see the world of food be brought out to us like this, and I found the world that they built in the process to be very well thought out, which I did not expect in the slightest. Its start is a bit predictable, but once you get into the plot of the film, you can't help but feel it is anything but basic. The voice actors are talented as always, namely Seth Rogen, Bill Hader, Nick Kroll, Michael Cera, and Ed Norton- to name a few. I also enjoyed Salma Hayek as a horny taco, although I did feel her character, as well as parts of the film in general, were a bit needlessly oversexualized. In the end, Sausage Party was not what I expected but a decent watch nevertheless. What it lacks in laughs, it makes up for in cleverness, and though that may not be enough for some, it was plenty filling for me.
My Rating: 8/10"
" Hmm
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,1,"WHITE PRIVILEGE. Couple half decent jokes, but nothing to be remembered by. Also completely disrespectful to not only indigenous of the world but basically anyone who is brown and not a wiener or who has one."
" Bad jokes
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,1,"Bad jokes, not funny at all, no story, bad ending.... Just don't watch!"
" Pretty good movie with some problems
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,7,"I love how everybody giving this negative reviews claims to love dark humor but can't take a single offensive joke or swearing. This movie was pretty funny it didn't have me dying of laughter but many of the jokes landed. The story was although containing typical cliches was entertaining and the concept was excellent. The animation was very good as well making this seem like a pixar film for adults.The reasons this movie isn't rated higher is that a) there are some major plotholes in the movie. For example, the food goes in weird places, for example, the sausage landed on the kitchen windowsill. If food was doing stuff like that in real life people would freak out. The ending also complicated things. The second problem with the movie is the wacky science stephen gum hawking was pretty funny though. The third problem with the movie, and main problem, was the constant social commentary that was unnecessary. This comedy about sausages having sex with buns somehow managed to comment on slavery, lgbtq rights, religious beliefs and the existence of God and the israel-palestine conflict.7/10"
" Revolotion of animation
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,10,"This movies's imdb score deserves 10 out of ten. I understand why people scored this game with low points. Because people use to watch animations for family fun. But this movie is serious and adult fan. Even movie touched realy importand issues even normal movies cant dare to touch. In result many conservative not enough civilated people did not like movie. Their mind closed to new things. This movie is masterpiece.Story, story tellings, dubs, animation quality, plot twists, fore shading Everything great in this movie. After 10 maybe people understand how good this movie is."
" Best adult animated comedy
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,10,We watched this movie multiple times and the laughter didn't stop. It is so well executed. Hoping for Sausage Party 2 in the future.
" Better off not being subtle
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,8,"Although Sausage Party went over the top with its crass humor and constant sexual innuendo, it somehow managed to stay fresh, which surprised me.The problem with most animated movies is that they become rather predictable once you strip off the initial sheen, and Sausage Party isn't that much different - in fact, you can predict the plot within the first minute - but it did so with so much reckless abandon and gusto, it totally entertained. If you're gonna be the bad guy, why not go complete (*)hole?.Don't get me wrong: this isn't a good film or one that I would recommend to friends, but to anonymous readers who don't actually know me? It's filled with stupid humor that will make you laugh, roll your eyes and sigh out of cheesy embarrassment, or it will totally offend and make you quite cross, there really is no middle ground here, which is why I rate it so highly.Sausage Party sets out its stall to be as crude and funny as possible and succeeds because it's not ashamed to do so."
" I never REGRET watching any movie like I do now
",2020-07-11 00:00:00,1,"DO NOT watch this GARBAGE it will poison your brain.
Just do anything in the world but DO NOT WATCH this SH**T!"
" Not for kids but I enjoyed it
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,7,"Best to watch while baked!Very funny satire on religion, atheism. Cleverly done. Don't know what all the 1* hatred is about! They obviously sat down to watch The Godfather and got a pisstake cartoon. What you expect?"
" Not bad
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,6,"Will offend a lot of prudish humourless people, or SJWs. It's mostly funny, some of the innuendos and swearing can feel a bit corny or worn out, but isn't as terrible as some make out. Probably just offended people of which the current decade of rife with. Or maybe seeing a animation done in the game style and CGI as many innocent/family friendly one's but with such adult humour is to out of place for some to look past. It's about food items in a supermarket awaiting paradise (paradise being to be selected by a customer and leave) but they are unaware of what awaits them once they leave the supermarket.Could it have been better? Probably, with more thought or emphasis on wit for viewers to catch than the straight in the face obvious humour; something many family animations aimed at kids manage to squeeze in for the parents. But it's worth a watch if you're bored and aren't offended over everything and anything."
" Oh, I Am SO SORRY You Were Offended!
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,10,"This movie was hilarious. It hit every single bullseye and then went out and got more bullseyes, and hit them.But some people are offended by this and I'm not entirely oblivious. I understand. Your mom was there. That woman from church you were trying to impress.The kids.C'mon. This is a long, dirty joke and it's funny. Get with it. Don't slam it because it was ""nasty"" because that just makes you a prude.I can't lie. I laughed out loud more than once. It was almost perfect. All these negs just drag down humanity. Stop the madness. If blue ain't for you, then opt out. Don't watch the movie, turn purple, and write a note to the bishop telling him how naughty this was and call it a review. Stop that behavior."
" Crude, Offensive, as it is supposed to be
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,6,"When I first saw this film being advertised in the cinema I simply wrote it off as being another one of those animated kid's films. It's not, and I certainly wouldn't be recommending people take their kids to see it. In fact when you see Seth Rogan's name attached to such as film, along with the actors that tend to congregate around him, then you sort of can sort of expect what it is going to be about. In fact, the innuendo in this film comes thick and fast, and honestly, looking at the title, I probably should have expected it when I first saw the poster. Oh, and the film is also full of expletives, particularly in the first couple of minutes.Yeah, this film could be considered to be a send up of all of those animated kids films that float around the cinemaspehere. Basically it takes the concepts of giving inanimate objects life, and does it with food. That doesn't sound too odd, except the main character is a sausage, and the heroine is a bun, and if you look at one of the posters you might actually start to realise what they are suggesting. Honestly, I'm quite surprised that it went right over my head at the time, because that poster is pretty suggestive (and I suspect that there were a lot of innocent kids wanting to see the film, without knowing what the poster was actually referring to).So, the film is about a sausage named Barry and a bun named Brenda. They are sitting on the shelf waiting to be picked up and taken to the great beyond, where they will live in harmony. Mind you, we all know what happens to food when they get taken out of the store, but the food doesn't, having been given this religion to keep them in hope. Mind you, there are also the ones that end up in the bin because they have gone stale, so there is that as well. However, what happens is that they are picked up, and there is a shopping trolley accident and Brenda and Frank end up on the floor, and thus go on a quest to return to their shelf in the hope that they can get into another package and go to the great beyond.There is so much in this film that pokes fun at literally everything. Like you have this bagel named Sammy Bagel Jr, and this Havash. Now, these characters are implied to be Jewish and Muslim, and of course there is this argument over the fact that the bagels have taken over the part of the store where the Havash and his ilk live (no doubt a reference to the ongoing Israel/Palestinian conflict). Further down the track we have this firewater, which is supposed to be an Indian due to the comments of his land being taken away. In fact, he hides in this cave with other imperishables, that appear to represent oppressed minorities.Yeah, this film is actually pretty clever, and offensive as well. It certainly does poke fun at religion, especially since I would be one to agree that religion is used to control people. The idea in this film was that the food were always terrified when they were taken because they knew that they were going to be killed, so the religion of the Great Beyond was created to calm those fears. Of course, when people end up coming back from the Great Beyond, they have stories of what is really going on.Mind you, the end scene certainly does suggest that religion is pretty restrictive, but I guess they do have a point, especially when you do consider some of the denominations out there. I, obviously, have my own thoughts on the matter, but in the end I also suggest that if the whole idea comes down to being nice to people, and helping them out as opposed to simply living a self-centered life, then that is the problem. Of course, it does work both ways, but it certainly does give us some things to think about."
" Disgusting
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,1,Disgusting...is the only word I can think of for it. If you really felt funny about this movie and these jokes - you need to go to the doctor and check your head!
" What a dumb mess!
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,1,"I mean, it is such an inappropriate movie that kids would never wanna go see on my watch! It wasted the talents of Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Nick Kroll, Seth MacFarlane, Paul Rudd, and even Bill Flipping Hader! The animation is uncanny, I think, and the story is very weak. The concept is so idiotic, considering it was an animated movie that kids cannot watch that is meant for adults! The characters are annoying, hateable, and horrible! The setups are so messy and mediocre for its concepts and scenes, and the language and adult s*x are so inappropriate. For starters, I would rather watch Phineas and Ferb, SpongeBob, and VeggieTales (which is way better to look at than this useless, pathetic, annoying pile of junk they call a movie about food)! The world building is very stupid! Again, this is one of the WORST movies to ever be released in such a strong year for animated movies! Again, Frank and Brenda are terrible protagonists, and the voice acting is obviously wasted (as mentioned earlier). Also, the writing is so dumb. I am gonna bang my head from how unfunny this movie is."
" You are either going to hate it or love it.. I LOVED IT

Every second of it is hilarious"
" 4th attempt watching
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,1,"This movie should have just been a 15 minute short film and maybe Then would be funny. I like Seth Rogan and most of his movies. But he tries to hard to be that ""Stoner"" comedian. We get it bruh, you smoke weed. So do I but also acting as if its not a drug is stupid and irresponsible. And then you make tbis movie that legit makes no sense. Even if its not suppose to make sense like some movies, it still should have a point to be watched. Stop making half ass movies while you're stoned."
" D*ck Joke, The film, the monstrosity that none of us asked for, but exists
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,1,"Let's be honest, this whole movie is one long d*ck joke that never ends.Sausage party is a nightmare of a film that Seth Rogan must have written while toking on some high THC ganja, because it makes no sense whatsoever. It wants to be a d*ck joke, but at the same time it somehow wants to be a film as well, and it just doesn't work.You can be as crude as possible for that shock factor, but you have to write a compelling story to go with it if you want it to succeed, which this film does not.This film should have never been made and it is not worth your time, unless you are baked out of your gourd, then it might be passable."
" Sausage Garbage!
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,2,"What was the story? Food believes that humans are Gods. That's the interesting premise of the movie. The third act makes the movie worst by killing every human who enters the grocery store. Wow! What the heck? Then a sex party happens. This movie sucks! It is not funny, their no charm, no characters to like, and the whole movie is believes it's own bs! Hate it!"
" An Hour and a Half Long Assault on Food and Fun
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,2,"Animation geared toward adults can be enjoyable. South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut comes to mind, along with the show that it is based on. But when the quality of the animation far supersedes the quality of the script, characters, and story...then you've gone terribly wrong. Such is the case with Sausage Party, Seth Rogen's first foray into the world of theatrical animation. As with many of Rogen's outings, this one falls short in a number of areas.But, as always, I like to begin with the positive, and this movie did have a couple. For one, the antagonist in the movie is always making an admittedly funny food pun, followed by the appearance of the product he's referring to. This product will then ask why he was calling them, to which he gets progressively frustrated as the movie continues. There's also a pretty good scene where a literal package of meatloaf arrives and sings, ""I Would Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That),"" and there's a nice analogy of the conflict in the Middle East when the Jewish and Islamic foods cannot learn how to share the same aisle.Other than that, this movie was a travesty from beginning to end. The script is one of the worst I've ever heard. All of the profanity and ""adult humor"" is forced and contrived beyond belief. The difference between South Park and this is that pretty much all the swearing in South Park comes from immature fourth grade boys who don't know any better. In Sausage Party, it's coming from characters we're supposed to take seriously. Throw in a lot of Rogen's ridiculous jokes in support of getting as high as possible, and you have the makings of a terrible film.The story is absurd. A sausage having an existential crisis? So...what about the pig, beef, and/or chicken he came from? Did they have existential crises before him? What about the packaged foods? Also, how the heck did Firewater and the rest of the non-perishables manage to get their story of ""The Great Beyond"" to every item in the store? Do they tell it to the new items when they come in on the supply truck? The entire thing leaves you with more questions than answers.I won't be watching this ever again. It's stupid at its best and diabolically asinine at its worst. Sure, there's a semi-clever food pun every now and again, but when your dialogue is 95% curse words, weed jokes, and sex puns, then you've gone terribly wrong somewhere. So yes, this is a Seth Rogen film...and it's made me realize that the greatest character he's ever played was that little mantis in Kung Fu Panda."

" Incredible animated comedy
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,9,"Sausage Party is an incredible animated comedy that doesn't waste it's amazing premise. It's outrageous and also has a surprisingly smart message. Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera and Nick Croll are all great. Salma Hayek, David Krumholtz and Edward Norton are all really good and Bill Hader is a perfect scene stealer. It's really funny throughout even if a few jokes aren't funny. The animation is really good and the direction by Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan is excellent. It's well paced and the music by Alan Menken and Christopher Lennertz is good."
" Name as many innuendo from the word sausage you can in 90 minutes
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,6,"Ok, with Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg involved you should be more than well aware of what this could and might be like. Imagine that and then times it by ten, twice for good measure. Sausage Party is funny, offensive, unbelievable, racist and downright not morally correct, all rolled together into a crazy animated film where anything goes (literally).Within Shopwell supermarket (and perhaps everywhere else?) the food is all alive (unbeknownst to us, ala Toy Story) and they are all waiting to be picked by the God's (us) to be taken out into the great beyond. There apparently is no greater thing in life for our dairy, vegetables and other food products. Well, except maybe for sex, and lots of it for hotdog sausage Frank (Rogen) and vagina shaped bun Brenda (Wiig). Next to each other on the shelf due to a promotion, they can think of nothing else but finally being able to slip into each other...anyway.When a product is returned and speaks of the terrifying truth about the great beyond, it is up to our band of heroic food products to find out the truth. Add in a sex starved lesbian taco, two racists in the forms of a bagel and a lavash, pot smoking non-perishables and you can probably see where it is all heading. The story itself along with the animation quality would be worthy of Dreamworks or Pixar, if it was aimed at kids. Which it is not. Definitely not.The script and voice acting are reasonable if nothing exciting, with very few star names in my opinion. The use of the f-bomb repeatedly in the beginning of the film grows old very quickly and if toilet humour is not your thing (along with the language) then I'd suggest steering clear. If you wish to see something quite unlike anything you've ever seen before (and keep watching out of amazement at what they included) then sausage Party will most likely tickle your funny bone.Overall Sausage Party is funny in places. It is also highly offensive to pretty much everyone, implies every stereotype under the sun and has some form of sex joke every few minutes. Some of these work and some miss the mark due to repetition. Vulgar, crude and very stupid, at times you will be open-jawed at their sheer audacity. Not a film for everyone.The Sage's Rating: 6/10"

" Hot Vulgar Trash
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,7,A Seth Rogan flick that offered no apologies for its sex jokes and stereotyping. Still found it more entertaining than expected. Brings me back to the era of those cheap but entertaining Adult Swim-style cartoons.3.5/5. Cheap sex jokes that inspire nothing more. Politically incorrect animation film that the teenager/manchild crowd would love.
" Original
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,9,"This movie really took food to a different level. I really appreciate this, because my own personal beliefs have dictated that everything has a living space within our lives. This movie elaborated on that, in the essence that, all of what we do and think and feel within a supermarket is within a grasp of reality that is not easily obtained by sheer logistic measure. I'm not saying that things in the supermarket are alive or dead. But what I am saying, from a consumer point of view, is that we are all much better off with our ability to just grab and go then we might realize. This cartoon is original, and you haven't seen anything like it before. It contains adult context and the ability to entertain at the same time. Was it meant to be a movie on your shelf? No, but it was meant to appeal to you as an adult. Children should not watch this movie, and you should make it your mission to make sure that they don't! This was made for us, as adults, by an adult, who is a stoner, and literally appeals to over 28 of the 50 states in America. I thought it was hilarious, I thought it was original, I thought it was really bending the ideas of reality through pure artistic expression through the staircase that is ""adulthood,"" and that expression might have been very ""adult"" at the time, but it mimics our captivity as adults in life as we know it; Constantly struggling to find comfort in the situation at hand-as is ""Life."""
" Raunchy Morons, And Nothing Else
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,3,"Sausage Party is based on a singular premise. ""It's a cartoon but they swear and do sexy things! Isn't that crazy?!"" You needn't delve any deeper, because the writers evidently didn't either. And they also evidently have never seen any cartoon from the 90s or 2000s, or they would know that this style of comedy has been done to death by so many others that we, the audience, are no longer shocked or amused by the simple utterance of a swear word. If they were intending to pander explicitly to 13 year olds who have just learned the full array of swear words available to them, or to youths too high to formulate coherent thoughts (and let's be honest, these guys are no stranger to these audiences), then they've done their job, but at the cost of dumbing it down to the level of pure cringe inducing, over-the-top idiocy.This is quite disappointing coming from these writers. Rogen, Goldberg and Hill have certainly been around the block when it comes to stoner comedy. Superbad (2007), Pineapple Express (2008) and This Is The End (2013) were all goofy and ridiculous, but they were able to pull it back just enough to leave room for something else besides swearing and sexual innuendo. And that's important. You can make a movie where swearing and dick jokes are the only source of humor (and they did), but it's going to suck. I won't mince words here. This humor is puerile, idiotic and takes no skill or effort.This movie feels the need to constantly bash you over the head with it's comedy and it's metaphors. ""Do you get it? The sausages are penises! Do you get it?!"" This is what it felt like watching the movie. It wasn't an enjoyable experience. It was a chore to wade through the overt and pointless exposition. Does every character need to be extremely horny, drunk or a babbling moron? The song at the very beginning could have been gold, but they chose to go the easiest route of literalness, with not even a hint of subtlety. It seemed like they weren't sure that people would get the religious metaphors, so they made sure to slap you in the face with it. There is no trust in the audience to get anything not spelled out in giant glowing letters. It's not only childish, it's insulting. I mean, the evil character, the one that is a huge jerk the whole movie, is literally a douche. Come on.Where do you go from here? It's seems like the writers and directors have exhausted the very limits of low-brow. You cannot get lower than this. The brow has sunk below the feet, under the earth, burned in the core of the earth. The same place where every copy of this movie should be, lest anyone suffer as I and many other have. The creators need to rewatch some Cartoon Network, brush up on how to do raunchy animated comedy, and then try again. Or better yet, stick to live action."
" Need a zero or less than to rate this movie
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,1,"I'd rather stoop over to pick up dog crap for 2 hours on a hot summer day than watch this piece of crap for one more minute. Gave it 1 star because that's the lowest rating possible. Wasted 15 min of my life watching on F/X. Anyone involved with making this animated wasteland should donate their profits to a non-profit that supports literacy or mental health. There is no redeeming value in this embarrassing, vulgar, and foul mess. This might be funny for a boy just hitting puberty, but its message is that men are pigs. Maybe that's why it's called ""sausage"" party?"

" Vile Humor Yet Satisfying
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,6,"Sausage Party had some really raunchy scenes in it. I was actually surprised and horrified at times. It had many funny moments, though I cannot say it kept me involved throughout. The cast is friggin incredible though, with lots of famous names and Rogan regulars making appearances. I liked the voices too.The story is about a grocery store. They celebrate the moment when they are picked up by humans and taken outside of the store. However, only a handful of the items know what really happens once they leave the grocery store: they get eaten. And so the story goes on about these grocery store items, hot dogs and buns specifically, trying to discover the truth and make their ways through the grocery store.It got a lot of attention when it came out. It fell shot for me though. There was just too much boredom in between. The ending was great/gross/funny. The beginning was pretty good.Worth a watch6 stars"
" Seth Rogan does 3D
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,6,"Sausage Party is a Seth Rogan film, indeed, in the closing credits he appears several times, and that's the problem. Even though the animation is as clever as anything you'll see out of Dreamworks or Pixar, this is still a Seth Rogan film with, now, very familiar style of humour. I did laugh out loud once, and to be fair, the animation (if not the humour) was sufficiently inspiring for me to see the movie through to the end. Hollywood as well as Britain has a similar problem with comedy that is does with sci-fi, in particular superheroes, zombies and anything initially successful, in that it will endlessly repeat such successful themes. From America come Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell comedies, one after another, which to some of us appear more of the same. From Britain come huge sex-based comedies such as Little Britain. Seth Rogan comedies follow a similar pattern, although his movies This Is The End (2013) and The Interview (2014) did represent something classically different. In the same way Sausage Party represents something different again. It's still basically powered by massive sexual innuendo and stoner culture however, like almost all of his work. Much as I'm sure that that is exactly why people love him, for those that find such humour immature, then I think it important in a review to point out that that is still very much what one is getting into when you elect to see this show."
" It was okay, sad how the animators were mistreated behind the scenes.
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,6,"As kind of excited at the concept of this movie since there isn't many adult animated movies anymore now. Even the animated movies for kids can feel like they're not trying at times. People say ""It's just for kids!"" but just because it's for kids doesn't mean you don't have to try. Also saw this pitch meeting sketch from Screenrant just to see what I'm getting into and it feels like this movie is pretty basic for a adult animated cartoon. Onto the review now.The movie starts with this supermarket and the food sing this song to start the day about going to ""The Great Beyond"" when they're chosen. There's also this sausage named Frank and this bun Brenda who want to have sex but can't until they get to the great beyond. Then there's this jar of honey mustard saying that the great beyond is a lie and the gods eat them.There's also this douche that's basically a jerk or a douche as people would put it. Then they meet a bagel that's Jewish and a falafel that's Arab and they all make it to the liqueur section of the store. There they meet a Native American whiskey called Fire Water, some grits that's black and hates crackers, and a Twinkie that's gay. The fruits are also gay as well and later in the movie there's this toilet paper and a condom that talk as well. There's also this taco played by Selma Hayek and she's a lesbian and likes Brenda. Also this piece of gum that's kind of like Stephen Hawking too.Around the end the food find out that the people they thought were gods can die. So they end up killing the people in the store and after that the food has this big orgy. It does't look that graphic, then again I've seen hentai so it felt tame to me. At then end they make this stargate to try and go to the human dimension, maybe hoping for a sequel.This movie felt okay but I heard behind the scenes the animators were mistreated and forced to work overtime without play. Hearing that it just makes me wonder about the animation industry in general now since people seem to rush this all in. Also seem to rely more on nostalgic cartoon reboots and intellectual properties. The reboots then just feel like they are the exact opposite of when the original or what the cartoon was about and that's kind of sad. Anyway give this a watch if you want but it doesn't seem to be TO deep like other adult shows now. There's just so many food puns and curse words you can say until it gets real old too fast."

We all know these guys, they're the guys behind all those raunchy comedies you may have enjoyed when you were like 12 years old. Unfortunately for them, we all grow up, and we become more mature with age, and all those movies they've put out will be embarrassing for you to watch because of how obscene and stupid and juvenile they actually were. But with Sausage Party, I just can't comprehend how something like this could have been made.
Sausage Party has to be the worst thing these guys ever released. With more swears than an Eminem song and the most unfunny, juvenile, obvious jokes ever, this thing is just gross and disgusting.
I can say that humor is one of the few things I could consider subjective, but boy, you have to be like a 10 year old or an American bro-dude to enjoy this crap.
I give this a 2 because of the concept (that itself is not bad), the message, and that Saving Private Ryan scene. Other than that, this movie is pure garbage."

" Uproarious Vulgarity and the Search for Higher Purpose
",2019-08-01 00:00:00,10,"""Brilliant"" is a word too loosely used, but the sidesplitting and deceptively cerebral ""Sausage Party"" is exactly that, as intense raunchiness is leveraged to skewer self-assured beliefism in what is one of film's greatest yet most derided satires.Every character in ""Sausage Party"" is a food item at a grocery store. And each wants to be purchased, sharing a belief that a higher purpose awaits beyond their limited shelf lives. What a brilliant metaphor for our own need to perceive something greater in store beyond what our life expectancies offer.Bringing together the disparate concepts of outrageously sexualized humor with the search for higher purpose is what plants ""Sausage Party"" firmly on the short list of film's most aspirational satires. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful."" Cheers!) - WATCHED IT?

I do think it's hilarious unlike some say, maybe they don't like crude/inappropriate stuff in a cartoon I don't even know it makes me nauseous wondering why people hate on good movies.

" Missed Opportunity
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,5,"I will say that I enjoyed this film when it first came out back in 2016, but in 2019, this film just doesn't do it anymore.This is intended to be an R-Rated parody of Pixar and Disney films, but is kinda empty and doesn't do enough with the premise.The first and last 20 minutes of this film are entertaining, but the rest leaves a lot to be desired. After the food gets split up from the market, they pretty much give up on jokes and just rely on swearing and sexual comments. There's nothing wrong with being vulgar, but if you don't have good jokes to back it up, it lacks a punch. This film isn't completely witless, and there are some clever moments, but there was a lot of missed chances.And the religious satire is pretty much the same thing we've seen on other adult comedies like Family Guy and South Park. The theme is pretty much that religion causes unnecessary division and doesn't allow us to explore ourselves. However, the delivery was not particularly original.I would be lying if I said this film didn't deliver any laughs. However, an R-Rated reimagining of Disney films should be more exciting, funny, and creative. It feels like the creators had a few good ideas, but didn't add on to them and ran out of steam."

And people high enough can see them then? No. Bad idea.Wish I could just hate it, but the core was pretty good. A sort of fully-horrifying version of Toy Story 2, with a secret life under our noses, and a terrible truth to it. Liked the premise, liked the parts that stuck to telling that story.

" Get it? They're cartoons but they say the sex
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,5,"When I reviewed The Little Prince, I named some things that don't automatically make you or anything else ""adult"". For instance, you don't need to let go of the whimsy of imagination and you don't need to conform to a system that dictates the entirety of your existence. When it comes to movies, meanwhile, there's a lot more to being adult than dropping F bombs and referencing the human mating ritual. This is where Sausage Party, which brags about being the rarity that is an R-rated animated movie, comes in.The thing with the R-rating is that you can always tell when the rating is a byproduct of the film that got made, versus when the film that got made set out to be rated R. Much like Deadpool, which was a purposeful attempt at an R-rated superhero movie, Sausage Party has just the right amount of forced sex jokes and crude language you'd except from a purposeful attempt at an R-rated animation. Does that make it dreadful? Not necessarily. But it does make it obvious.Speaking of obvious, every character in the film is some sort of grocery store item and their gender seems to be determined by which ones are phallic and which ones look vaginal. The voice cast, as usual, is all stars and no voice actors but some of them do an ample job. Seth Rogen leads the film as a sausage who is brought from the supermarket to ""The Great Beyond"" (the average human home), and his co-stars include Johan Hill as yet another sausage, Kristen Wiig as a hot dog bun (get it?), Michael Cera, Craig Robinson, Paul Rudd (as one of the few human characters), Edward Norton, James Franco, Salma Hayek (as a taco shell that's also a lesbian), Bill Hader in a dual role, Danny McBride, and Nick Kroll.The plot, naturally, is that all the items come to the realization that The Great Beyond isn't all that great and that a fate of getting eaten, or worse, awaits them. There are some laughs and sparse moments of cleverness throughout the movie but nothing about it wowed me the way it has evidently wowed movie-goers. I got a good chortle out of watching these guys gaze in horror as their friends got turned into dinner, though not only did the shtick seem familiar to me, but it also would have worked better as a short sketch on YouTube. Even the mind-screw ending reminded me of certain parts from The Lego Movie.The film was directed by Greg Tiernan with a little help from Dreamworks' own Conrad Vernon. The writing was done by the likes of Rogen himself and his good friend Evan Goldberg, which goes without saying if you've seen any of their other films prior to this one. They've had some legitimately great and smart films, but you can always tell that they love to throw in their t-ttyf-ck jokes and drug humor when they concur that it's getting a little slow. When you get used to the formula, you kinda stop being impressed.Certain jokes are Foodfight-level food product puns except dirtier (somehow). There's also the occasional ""douche"" pun in the form of a character who is a douche both literally and figuratively. If you don't get it, in spite of the fact that even the most toddling of toddlers would, then don't worry - the joke goes on for a while. There is also music, and whenever it's not ""whatever the kids are listening to on the Spotifies these days"", it's a score by Alan Menken. Your guess is as good as mine, dear reader.Although the animation isn't technically anything remarkable, it's worth mentioning that almost half of the animators weren't paid for their work. As I'm writing this, they're even looking to take one of the production companies, Nitrogen Studios Canada, to court for wage theft. When a movie gets made under such inexcusable circumstances, it's hard for me to be appreciative of it. And independent of this unhappy behind-the-scenes fact, the film still ain't especially great. I'm rating it 2.5/5 douches.At least Rogen and Goldberg and the rest of the crew can rest easy knowing they made the world's first animated feature film that isn't meant for kids. Except for Heavy Metal, the South Park movie, Waltz with Bashir, Anomalisa, Mary & Max, Down and Dirty Duck, Fritz the Cat, Beavis & Butthead Do America, Felidae, and The Killing Joke, which came out just a few weeks before Sausage Party even. But other than that, though..."

" A huge helping of WTF
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,8,"Frank (a sausage) and Betty (a bun) are looking forward to finally getting more than just tips together when they are purchased, and get to go to the Great Beyond. Yet there are rumours that the Great Beyond is a lie, and that horror and death await. And, worse, it turns out that the rumours are true!Sausage Party is a CGI movie which combines a story based on a pleasing and very silly ""what if?"" (""what if your food was actually alive?"") and Seth Rogen's crew of the usual suspects, both writers and performers. This means that is delivered with a healthy (or perhaps unhealthy) dose of pure filth - toilet humour, profanity, drugs and sex.Let's make no bones about it: much of what we see is infantile, and designed to shock and outrage, as anyone who was seen any of Rogen's work will already know. Having said that, it's pretty funny stuff, well animated and voiced, and a much needed antidote to the mostly squeaky-clean CGI features which come out from Disney, Pixar, Dreamworks et al.And it has a bit of substance, too. Lavash (Arabic unleavened bread) and Jewish Sammy the bagel are at odds, what with being stocked next to each other. When Lavash is confronted with the unpleasant truth that he will not be presented with unlimited virgin olive oil on arriving in the Great Beyond, why, the obvious solution is masses of joyous gay sex, isn't it? I'm not sure if this is the most profound commentary on the Middle East problem I've ever encountered, or the most ridiculous and depraved. It is possibly both. But it also shows that there is more to this silly, silly, crude, crass and very funny film than meets the eye.The film finishes with a comprehensive orgy with much imaginative comestible copulation, and a final metafictional resolution, and I walked out chuckling while wondering what the hell it was I had just seen."
" Clever but language was overused
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,5,"This was very amusing & clever, however it could do without the gratuitous f-bombs. We've all heard the word before, it could be used less with greater effectiveness. As usual, it's perfectly acceptable to call white people crackers all the time, and yea, I get that it's an anthropomorphic adventure, but is that supposed to be funny? It's not."
" One of, if not THE worst movie ever made!
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,1,"This film is absolute cinematic garbage. Worse than that, ""garbage"" isn't even a strong enough word to describe this abomination. This ""film"" feels like they took a concept that could work as a YouTube short, stretched it out to feature length, and crammed it full of profanity and remarkably unfunny sex jokes.The fact that this film was greenlit is a crime against humanity. I would give this thing zero stars if I could. More than that I'd give it NEGATIVE stars if I could!This cinematic abomination has a decent concept, but it's so poorly executed that it resulted in an unfunny, overly vulgar, and all around unbearable 90 minutes.Foodfight, the Emoji Movie, and Troll 2, are all better than this pile of filth. If I could destroy every copy of this film in existence, I wouldn't even think twice about it.Do yourself a favor and give this film a pass. It doesn't deserve your attention, and you deserve better than this"

From the minds that gave us this movie it's fairly obvious where it was going. The movie was fantastically funny. The bath salt seems alone was enough to buy the ticket. And if you bought the ticket you might as well take the ride."

" Wow! Shocked and surprised
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,9,"I wasn't sure what to expect when my friend turned this on, but I'm glad he did! What a hilarious 97 minutes or so this was. Having watched this twice now, I really am surprised that this film got commissioned in the current world - the jokes, subjects of offence and vulgarity of the film are things that I never thought would be allowed in such a politically correct world, but fair play for it being allowed to be released.How anyone came up with this idea I've no idea, but thank you to whoever did, because I loved Sausage Party!"
" If I could give it less than 1 star I would.
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,1,"For the first few minutes I found the sexual referencing and swearing in song pretty hilarious, but as the movie went on it was just going too far. The swearing was far too excessive, there was a lot of drug use (which says something about the guy who wrote this movie), and there was also a fair amount of offensive stereotyping too. It got beyond amusing and was just plain offensive with half the script being nothing but profanities. When I eventually got to watching it through I was not at all entertained but was angry with myself for letting myself watch it through. It went from being plain offensive to absolutely vulgar just for the sake of pushing how far they could go with this movie. Very distasteful and pure garbage. There were very few moments where I found the movie funny but this paled to the amount of frustration and disgust I felt in watching the majority of it. You don't have to be sickening to be an adult movie."
" Why didn't they donate the money?
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,1,It was horrible in every aspect. Very disturbing. Not funny at all. Thats it.
" Had promise, but isn't all that funny
",2018-09-21 00:00:00,3,"There are very few major Hollywood studio animated movies made for adults, so it's a double shame when one of them does not work, since the failure probably won't encourage more to be made. ""Sausage Party"" is unfortunately one of those failures. What makes it even a sadder failure is that you see a better, cleverer, and funny movie seemingly being held back by a creative team that has the wrong idea of what an adult audience would like. I will admit that the movie is fairly well animated for what wasn't a mega budget. And occasionally there is a gag that will make the viewer smile or even chuckle a little. But unfortunately, the level of humor for the most part is pretty wrong-headed. We get offensive racial stereotypes, questionable attempts at humor (such as a ""rape"" sequence involving food products), and the belief that characters constantly uttering foul language is the stuff of hilarity. I wasn't bored, but all the same I sat in my TV chair pretty stone-faced throughout. If you are looking for animation made for an adult audience, look for an offering from Japan instead."
" A great movie ruined by its writers!
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,6,"Sausage Party is an adult, animated and comedy movie, and yeah, it was good, but if they just lowered the insults or the unnecessary sexual references it could have been a great R-rated animated movie!The message of this movie is very clear and strong, and I liked it! But why every single minute and every-single-one is insulting the other for no reason? And why everyone is really insulting at the first place? No one, literally no one, was saying the F-word too much! That was actually unnecessarily!The blood and the violence were actually gross, and again unnecessarily!The movie is still great though and it was deserving a 9/10, but when everyone turns to some sex-addict and everyone goes to have sex with everyone else and it just turned into ""sex, even if I'm not gay, but I just want to have sex with everybody"", I thought 8/10 would be nice for such a movie!Actually, I have no comment about the story, or the voices or the animation, my problems are existing only because of how they over R-rated it! They could have made it R-rated, but without over-insulting,or over-sex-talking!Anyways, Sausage Party is very bold and clear. So I'm gonna give it an 8/10!"
" This movie is about losing it
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,4,"And by losing it I mean touch with reality, humor, quality, etc etc.
Rogan has drunk his own cool aid and believes every wiff of fart he puffs out is quality humor worth sharing. M night Shyamalan twist. It isn't.
This is the biggest worst talent black hole since movie 43, a well made terrible idea, well, I don't know that the actual idea is so bad, just the delivery style. No one wants to hear your stoner fart jokes any more. Maybe Rogan's parents need to have that chat with him on how to behave in public. Stop smoking so much weed."
" The movie Free Birds should've been
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,10,"Sausage Party is one of Seth Rogen's best original filmd ever created and it really deserved a lot more cult followings. It appeals to both critics and audiences with a lot of hilarious subversive humor that actually works. Too bad Cartoon Network's Flicks movies can't be like this film and Free Birds is just a cheap adult animation wanna be, yeah we need more R-Rated animated films.."
" Dirtiest dumbest cartoon ever

" The rape scene just did it for me!
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,1,"Terrible plot! Terrible humour! Brainless comedy with very offensive scenes. Especially the graphic rape scene!! How is rape of a helpless juice box entertaining? I was so shocked and upset at that point that the it just stuck with me throughout the movie..
Plus the ending was horribleeeeee with the stupid food sex orgy that goes on for 5 mins!"
" Seth Rogen must have a death wish
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,9,"Wow. OMG. First North Korea and now, maybe, the most brutal (and definitely the most offensive) takedown of religion ever made. Seth Rogen really baits some potentially dangerous people. This kind of comedy would quite literally put your life at risk in many parts of the world currently. (Thank goodness for freedom of speech and expression, since underneath all the filth some well-known but still perceptive observations are really hammered home.) The foul language along with the sexual crudity and innuendo are so non-stop you'd have to watch this flick many, many times to catch all of it. It's a really tight script, but an adult film in every sense of the word, and I really do mean in every sense of the word. I can imagine kids wanting to watch this movie, and parents wanting to watch it, but I can't imagine either of them wanting to watch it together. I took one star off of a perfect 10 because the continuous obscenity started to exhaust me some towards the end; however, I still really liked it, and the world is a much better place for stuff like this being out there somewhere, at least as far as I'm concerned."

" Gross.
",2018-08-14 00:00:00,1,"I enjoy Family Guy, I liked the few episodes I've seen of Archer and Robot Chicken. The Simpsons is a favorite. This movie was not what I was expecting at all.... it was so much worse. The farther we got into the movie the more repulsed we were, and my viewing partner was a master of crude humor, and even he didn't laugh. Just so very sad."
" I feel less intelligent after watching this
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,1,"This movie was just the worst.The target audience is definitely 14 year old ""edge lords"". I shudder to think of anyone who actually appreciates the so called comedy in this film. There are very few actual jokes, and mostly just inappropriate and crass lines of dialogue that feel very, very forced.The movie relies on the exploitation of racial, religious, cultural and sexual stereotypes that are harmful to their respective communities. There are ways to satirise and poke fun of certain groups that can be done in an amusing and intelligent way... this is not one of them.The reference to drug use just seems painfully shoved in, and unnecessary. In fact, this whole film is unnecessary. I was waiting for something remotely funny or amusing to happen and I sat through an hour and a half of pure profanity and mindless sludge until the credits started rolling.Visually I guess the film is impressive- but the character models seem odd and unnatural. I can't fault the animators for this though, given they have to make literal cans of soup into characters. This film should have been stopped as a bad idea on paper long before it proceeded to also be badly executed.In conclusion, I hate myself now. This movie has made me hate myself. I can often laugh at Seth Rogen's comedies; Superbad is a very good film, This Is The End had it's moments and even The Interview had one or two moments that made me smile. This film offers nothing. It tries way too hard to be edgy, and comes across as pathetic for trying so hard. A hard pass."
" Terrible practices behind the sets
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,1,"Sausage Party isn't an all around bad movie, but the treatment of the animators wouldn't be out of place in a list of the most terrible atrocities committed by mankind, which is why I have to award this film with the lowest score possible. Animators were forced to work unpaid overtime at threat of blacklisting.There's a number of funny gags and one-liners throughout the movie, but it's got some serious flaws that are a staple of Seth Rogan films. A huge portion of the film is dedicated to stoner comedy, and I'd hate to break it to you, but stoner comedy is not funny.The animation is nice, and the film has a number of funny gags throughout, but it has some serious pacing issues right in the middle where it drags for a significant chunk of the movie. The ending is also stupid and pointlessly sets up a sequel that already sounds as shallow as its cliched setup."
" I feel so bad for the animators
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,1,"I think I get it. This movie is for people who are high and got the giggles as I can't imagine anyone in their right mind would watch this. The entirety of the movie is crappy puns about food relative to stereotypes such as fruits representing homosexuals.Other than that I heard the animators got a worthless pay and this is what their animation amounted to, edgy 14 year old humor."
" Take it for what it is!
",2018-08-02 00:00:00,7,"If you're here expecting an insightful, comedic masterpiece this isn't for you. This movie is for people who are down to watch it with an open mind and value it based on what it has to offer! As a satirical cartoon, it's pretty great. This movie is so entertaining, original, blunt, crude and fun to watch. If you're someone who rated it less than 3 stars, ask yourself why you decided to watch a movie called ""sausage party"" to begin with. What did you expect if not this? The crown jewel of Hollywood production? I think not. :)"
" Lame Party
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,2,Overhyped trash movie. Good concept but turned out like a fan made Toy Story spin off. Would only recommend this is your baked 2/10
" The adult animated comedy that goes too far.
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,3,"""Sausage Party"" has a fantastic premise: Food items in the grocery store are excited to be purchased by humans who they believe to be gods. When they are chosen, they believe they go to food paradise and enjoy heaven but when they realize the truth, all hell breaks loose. The premise alone is enough to watch the film with great anticipation. It's an adult-humor animated comedy not afraid to go all the way while also providing fascinating perspective commentary on society, politics, and religion. The film ultimately does say what it wants to say but by the end, I found myself spiting the film for how it said it. First of all, the humor. This film has garnered a reputation for being a hard 'R' film for it's strong crude and sexual content and language. As the film progressed, I noticed that the language was so frequent that the humorous shock value had disappeared by the middle of Act II. For the sake of going ""all the way,"" it's obvious that the writers wanted to take it even further which made the film less funny. In this case, over the top was a strong asset until it became so much that I just felt sick watching it. It didn't become humorous anymore and it just became obsence and vulgar for the sake of just vulgarity. At that point, I believe the target audience has changed from intelligent adults ready for some raunchy humor to teenagers trapped in adults bodies. Not to be rude myself but the film lost its intelligence and appealed to much more basic and rudimentary tastes of entertainment.Second, the message. Along with the humor, there is such thing as over the top and while the premise promised an intriguing critique of previously listed themes, the script's dialogue, characterization, and overall delivery became quickly heavy handed and in your face. Not long after Act I was over that I realized the message of idiocrisy of religion and religious-based beliefs and ideas were being forced down my throat in an offensive and distasteful way. Major complaints aside, I thoroughly enjoyed the animation style. Lots of work went into the aesthetics of the film and I think the animation is, by far, the movie's greatest strength. The cast also boasts some very talented actors and actresses that make talking hot dogs believable. What humor was present and landed well, I think not only goes to some saving graces in the script but in the talented people voicing the characters. In particular, Seth Rogen and Kirsten Wig did a great job as the story's leads. Overall, I liked the talent and animation and several jokes landed really well. However, due to the inherent flaws in the script's vision and the humor getting ridiculously over the top and just gross, I can't and will not recommend this to anyone. It's obscene just because it's bored. If you're interested in animation films for adults, I would recommend high quality works that having something to say while retaining the intelligence and goodwill that the audience should demand. Recommendations: Fantastic Planet (1973), Perfect Blue (1997), Akira (1988), Anomalisa (2015), etc."
" This is Foodfight as it should have been.
",2018-07-17 00:00:00,5,"Does that mean that it was an intolerable piece of unfinished rawness? 
Not really, it's definitely not for everyone, and I at times struggled to get through the raunchy, juvenile and terrifying scenes more than once filled with as much gore that can be made by food. But I had a few laughs and I liked how it spoofed both Disney and Pixar and a lot of other films and such. It had enough far-fetched scenes without the loudness and inuendos to be pretty funny at times. I may not be seeing it again soon, but it had enough meat to make up for the abundance of food puns and juvenile nature.Shout-out to Alan Menken for composing the catchy music for Sausage Party!"
" Dont expect super sophisticated satire.
",2018-07-11 00:00:00,9,"This movie is not very complex, so don't come looking for some hidden meaning or sophisticated comedy. If you just want a good laugh and don't get all high and mighty about the lack of intelligant jokes, then this movie is just the ticket."
" NO NO, I'M A VEGAN...!
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,9,"Sausage Party is an anarchic, smarmy, repellent excuse for an animated feature but it is also quite brilliant. Bringing in disparate influences such as Bakshi & Crumb, Rogen & company sexually deviant doper humor makes this akin to a magnificent car crash you can't look away from. You'll never walk through your local supermarket & feel the same again."
" So poor
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,1,"To give context to how poor this film is I have just reset a password for an IMDB account I forgot I even had. It's been 8 years since I logged on.
I have never seen anything so amateurish, just generally not good. I am so dissatisfied with this film that I genuinely wish I could punch the makers of this film in the face.It is racist, sexist and generally offensive. I'd have no issue with this if it wasn't due to the fact that it's just not funny, at all, or clever, or witty or interesting.So bad..."
" I absolutely hated this.
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,1,"Be careful telling your kids all animated films are ok to watch. This is strictly adults only and even then, not for the faint-hearted it seems! Completely and utterly stupid and inappropriate. Whoever came up with a demented idea like this? If you made it past the logline and actually started watching the film, good luck seeing it through to the end. How many f words can you cram into one movie?"
" What's that thing with the f word?
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,3,"Is it an American thing to say f*** multiple times to make things more shocking? Does it make things more adult? Cooler? It only annoys me, after hearing it at least 20 times in 5 minutes I switched off. Great idea, but not for me."
" Raunchy food for thought.
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,10,"This is not a masterpiece like Spirited Away, but it's fun and unique. Don't show this animated movie to kids, the F word and S word are consistently used, and there are many sexual jokes. the movie also makes you think about how to treat people with different religious beliefs. I recommend 16 and up see this. Turn your brain off and enjoy!"

" Regret watching this

" Disgusting.
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,1,"Good job writers. Now you are seriously starting to exaust your possibilities for putting out fresh original content for animation movies. Did you ever consider what comedy content you are gonna come up with now that you've used up overused food ethnic jokes? You are so desperate just to get a gut belly laugh that you put in a slew of predictable jokes and puns, and insulting humor, just to attract viewers who think and probably behave just the way you do. Your worst than a 3 year old who has a potty mouth and doesn't know when or how to stop. That's just straight up sadd. There's only one word to describe the creators of this movie and this movie. Disgusting.
(Anyone who found this movie really funny, hate to break it to you, you ain't got an imagination. Grown adults, Go back to pre-K and sit with a bunch of 2 to 3 year olds listening to a teacher reading picture books. Writers of this filthy movie, you too.)"
" Waste of potential
",2018-05-05 00:00:00,2,"I only have praise, for the concept of this film. The idea for this film's premise was remarkable, and I had high hopes for this film - despite my personal dislike of Seth Rogen and his style of comedy, I hoped that studio control would have reined this in a little.
Unfortunately, Seth Rogen's style of excessive vulgarity is what opens the film, and doesn't let up. Swearing only has impact, when it is sudden, and elevates the circumstances. Opening at the high end of swears, means you can't escelate any further scenes, therefore the daialgue can't convey any urgency or danger. Attempts at comedy through stereotypes were lazy and predictable, as were the sexual jokes. 
The film only receives a 2, for the animation quality, and having the odd funny bit."
" True story
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,1,"I loved all the voice actors involved, so I bought the movie. I watched 3/4 of it without a laugh, and lots of racism. I took it out of my DVD player, and threw in in a box bound for Salvation Army."
" Unparalleled sin
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,2,"I think devout Christians don't inherently hate atheists, or even if they were touched by the Lord's word, they would never hate a fellow brother, but content like this must at least make them shake their heads and search for points where that atheist ""took the wrong path in life."" This movie was an embarrassment. It's an ostentatious crazy man, dressed only in robes and sporting sporadic hair and long, chipped fingernails, yelling slurs at people on the street as they quickly shuffle by him with groceries clutched closely to their chests so that he may not grab an apple out of their bag, take a bite, and then proceed to harass them, spittle and apple juice flying onto their face as they weep for their dignity. That man is Seth Rogan, and the victim is me. In short, this movie made me feel sad, depressed, lonely. And very uncomfortable I might add. The animation felt off in a really gross way. In a way, the animation reminded me of those like animated pornography videos where it takes the Family Guy characters and they have sex. Like it was that cheap, creepy, and unnatural, and a few parts here and there made my skin crawl due to how uncanny they looked. But the worst part, regarding animation, was just the character designs; not only is the theme presented to you like you're a dumbass, the jokes are presented to you that way too. Wow, that bun was oddly anthropomorphic; was it supposed to make me horny? Its limbs really creeped me out, like they come out of nowhere and they sort of just like disappear into the bun's ass, but they don't really mold at all? I guess all of the limbs in this movie were kinda weird and gross. Weird and gross things also reminded me of all of the racist stereotyping in this movie? Like wow the Jewish bagel has a big nose and it doesn't get along with the Arab lavash. Idk it just felt really distasteful, especially in a day and age where everyone gets called out on their BS. Generally however, I think it's good to poke fun in this way because it reminds us that nothing really is sacrosanct and everything is on the playing field as far as comedy goes, but this edgy humor offended me more because it was bad more than any of the wide variety of controversial topics it brushed (religion, abstinence, race, Stephen Hawking? (RIP)). I will admit however, a few got through my cracks, for I am not impervious!, and they gave me a chuckle, and if it can at least intentionally entertain me a little bit, it's not a perfectly awful movie. Anyhow, the most offensive piece of this whole movie was the atheist ""WAKE UP SHEEPLE"" point of view. Hey Catholic over there! You're blinded by God's semen in your eyes! One, this sort of statement is incredibly preachy and just generally offensive, and it would just push the wool further over the eyes of that individual. (To be transparent, I think I would identify as an atheist, depends on what side of the bed I wake up on). And they address how atheists shouldn't be as preachy as religious people and then they aren't and it just solves the problem? Providing a rational dogmatic argument in a debate on religion, WHERE YOU CAN'T BE DOGMATIC, against a holistically brainwashed opposing community is not going to sway anyone whatsoever. No one will give a damn. But of course, this movie just has to follow a beat by beat generic movie structure where all the sad parts have to be resolved really quickly because this animation is super expensive and we can't afford to make an actual reasonable ending and the villain has to be defeated even though he wasn't really the main antagonist and was more of just a nuisance, but you know, whatever I guess. Another positive thing I have is that while it hits the sad part where the characters divide up (because they always have to!), it brought this about in a way that just makes sense. And even though it's a really clichéd move, it executes it very soundly. But back to the theme, I think the movie would have been much better if a character came onto screen and just read a very extensive (well, not too extensive because most of these ideas were pretty thin and were exhausted waaaaay before the 45 minute mark) monologue expressing the opinions of the writing crew rather than just writing a script where the characters are talking to each other, but they're always actually talking to you. Any line could have been taken out of context and just stated as a fourth-wall breaking statement to the audience and it would make sense/wouldn't feel out of place. Also, it felt they really wanted to get this message across so they dumbed it down like even below the common denominator. Below the common denominator in math doesn't even really make sense, but somehow this movie managed to do just so because it just that stupid. And I wanted to add that I really hated most of the transitions between the two main story arcs - a lot were really corny and they always came at awful times and interrupted whatever flow this movie had going for it. Idk I can't really sum this up other than just simply saying it's a mess, a stain on the movie industry, the eight deadly sin, and generally just an embarrassment to the entire human condition."

" Has some monstrous laughs...but for the most part falls flat
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,5,"Over the top is putting it lightly. Sausage Party is nothing but crude, vulgar, gross, and mostly unfunny. Granted, there are a few clever elements that are extremely funny (Gum as Stephen Hawking), but for the most part it's a senseless sex comedy that tries really hard but ultimately falls flat. The plot is ridiculous, humans being evil gods for eating (or rather ""killing"" the food), and they can enter the 4th dimension and understand and interact with the food when they get high on bath salts. The main character Frank the sausage wants to find out the truth about what actually happens when food leaves the grocery store. Is it paradise, or will they die? The other villain besides humans is the douchebag. LOL. I tried to enjoy it, I really did, but I was just sitting there asking myself WHY? What is the film trying to achieve? I get that the different foods represent different cultures and ethnic groups. So what? The climax is nothing but a fight against the humans in the grocery store. How dare the humans eat (kill) food? This is a movie, yes. Completely implausible, yes. Pointless? Absoutely. It would have been way better as a 30 minute short. Could have gotten the same message across and I wouldn't have gotten as bored."
" Review 03 - Sausage Party
",2018-02-15 00:00:00,5,"Sausage party tells the story of foods in a supermarket imagining life on the outside of the store. Their mission is to get chosen by the humans to begin a new life on the outside. After viewing the trailer, this film was automatically on my to watch list. Unfortunately i was disappointed.I am just going to mention that the swearing is very often and over used. In fact most sentences said by the characters contain at least 1 swear word. I know this is an adult humor title, but they could have calmed that down!The story is pretty good however. There were moments where i couldn't stop laughing on some parts; other parts tried to be funny but failed. I did enjoy the beginning song that introduced some of the characters, it added a warm and funny start to the rest of the film.Sausage Party definitely has the most messed up and disturbing ending scene out of any film i have watched. It dragged on for a while which made me just want the film the end quicker. The whole of the last scene went on for ages which just got boring and very strange towards the end. Overall this film was alright. If you enjoy films that are over the top with attempted comedy and sexual references then I would say maybe rent this title. I just think you would be disappointed in my opinion. I love animated comedy titles but this one just didn't really make me laugh as much as i hoped for."
" Bad Movie with Bad Language
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,1,"I wished I had read the R rating on this movie before I started to show it to my kids ages 8 & 9. I turned it off as soon as I herd the first language inappropriate sord (lots of F and S words in it,) If I could, I would give it 0 *'s."
" Inaproppiate, vulgar.
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,2,"This movie was incredibly awkward and uncomfortable to watch. It is very sexual and vulgar, especially the end. And definetely not for kids. It's a waste of time and I would not recommend this to anyone."

" The ultimate adult animated film.
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,9,"WARNING: NOT FOR KIDS! This movie is really hilarious! Me and a friend of mine went to see it and we did all we could not to cry from laughter in the theater. This movie is raunchy, it's offensive, it's atypical, and that's what makes it totally awesome. I've never had such a good time at a movie then I did with this one. If you got the most dirty mind you know of or you like movies that go against the grain of Hollywood then watch this one. Seth Rogen is a genius!"
" Hm... Hard corn porn - NOT FOR CHILDREN!!!
",2018-01-25 00:00:00,4,"At the first sight, I was expecting more,...I guess, because of listing who wrote it and who gave voices. That first time, I couldn't watch it at the end, but yesterday decided to see it completely. From my point of view, I saw one animated hard corn porn and nothing more than that. Even the humor in it is on some low level. As some people would say, it isn't made for intellectuals. I don't know why the writers used so much vulgarity, as they did not know what else to write?! Probably it is their ordinary language. Ok, they wanted to show some associations between food industry products and human parts of body, those intimate, and that gum as Stephen Hawking, but even for Hawking it is humiliating."
" Not for family!! or Kids!
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,2,"I thought i was gonna be the ""cool"" dad, but things went horribly wrong! I was bring my 12 year daughter an several of her friends to the movies. When we got there our movie was sold out. So my daughter & her friends asked if we could go see the animation movie ""sausage party"" i recall being sceptical because of the rating but they all wanted to go so i agreed. In the beginning i thought this is ok, my was at relief when i seen the singing and i thought this isn't going to be so bad! Then thing's turned dreadful. The bun's showed up and starting talking about what a tight fit it would be for the sausage and i could her the girls gasping all the way down the row in the theater. I asked my daughter if we should leave, which she opted ""not to"". Thing's got more and more uncomfortable, the entire theater looking at the girl's wondering what the hell they are doing at this movie! As each scene passed the condiments got more and more filthy, as they talked about how tight their bun's were. The ending just about all hell broke loose and i had to escort the girls out during a condiment orgy as i was horrified and the entire theater was looking at us! When we got outside we had to agree to never talk about this ever again or mention it to their parent's. It was extremely uncomfortable."
" Great animation but awful storyline
",2018-01-19 00:00:00,1,"Kudos to the team who worked on the animation, great work! But unfortunately the storyline just isn't humorous at all. I got up many times from boredom."
" forced and bland humor, a big disappointment
",2018-01-06 00:00:00,3,"Sausage Party is a big disappointment to me, I was very excited to watch, I was sure that I would like the movie, especially because it has a humor that I like a lot, but then I was very disappointed with the movie and its forced humor, the jokes of the film sometimes goes beyond the limit, the jokes are very adult but even so sometimes it exaggerates, hits in a few moments, but are very rare, the voice work is good but Seth Rogen has to stop playing characters with almost always the same personality and his character in this film is no different, there are still Kristen Wiig, Nick Kroll, Michael Cera, Salma Hayek, Paul Rudd, James Franco, Edward Norton and etc, is a great cast, but many misused and that it's very possible you do not even notice when it does appear, the story of the movie is interesting and had potential, but it's wasted, the final scene is pretty bland and exaggerated for a change, Sausage Party is disappointing, bad and potentially wasted. Note 3.0"
" Crazy - in a mostly good way
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,6,"'Sausage Party' is... well, just plain nuts! Probably the best description is ""absurd"". It's certainly unique, being the first 'adult' GCI film (not just a cartoon like the 'South Park' movie) and it does all it can to push the boundaries of making sure you remember it's not a kids film (even though it starts with a song), with so many swear words, racial stereotypes, sexual innuendo and drugs in the first 30min that you can't forget it's a Seth Rogen film. Frank (the sausage, Rogen) and his girlfriend Brenda (the bun, Wiig) can't wait to get out of their packages and be united in the ""Great Beyond"" outside the supermarket.When Barry (Cera) and Carl (Hill), Frank's sausage buddies, are bought and find out the truth of what happens to food, they try to return to warn the others. The voice actors are great - Sammy (bagel, Norton), Lavash (Krumholtz), Teresa (taco, Hayek), Douche (Kroll), Firewater (Hader), Grits (Robinson), Honey mustard (McBride). It's part road trip, part action/'Die Hard' and part stoner rom-com. The ""human world"" vs ""food world"" distinction is done well, with faded colour vs vibrancy. Some of Rogen's almost-sermons on not following the religious crap you're fed without proof is good, but the anti-religion message is lost in the chaos.It's not as uproarious as I was hoping - it's certainly funny and has a lot of chuckles, but there wasn't many truly hilarious moments for me. Part of that is my expectations being too high - I've been waiting for this film for three years and it's nowhere near as good as 'Knocked Up', 'Superbad' or 'Pineapple Express'. Some of the best bits are the morbid/violent bits, not necessarily the dialogue. The last 20min or so didn't really work for me - a bit too much. There's so much going on and so many things to look at and listen to that some jokes are lost or skipped over."
" Not Bad
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,6,"I am not into Animated Movies. But this one ? It is inappropriate for kids, that's true, but why make it Animated ? That's because it's the only style as which it'd be portrayed.It made a fine hour, sometimes laughed, sometimes concentrated, but mostly didn't yawn or felt awkwardness during the film. It's not that bad, although full of dirty jokes, which is the last resort of comedy when you're out of humorous ideas."

" really really funny for normal people
",2017-11-22 00:00:00,10,"really funny movie for more fun-loving cool minded viewers but might be offensive to very sensitive people. it's not for kids and couples (if you have a really sensitive GF/BF) I watched it with guys and it was really funny and super entertaining. if you get offended easily this movie may trigger you but if you watch it as a fun movie with jokes, and have a ""hard"" sense of humor you will definitely enjoy it. and ""don't watch it with kids"""
" Definition of awesomeness
",2017-11-21 00:00:00,9,"WTF I just watched ?! I heard many things about this movie and everything was true, but even if I did know what to expect I was swept off my feet. Adventure that, in very vulgar and explicit way, makes fun of racial, political, sexist, homophobic and every other stereotype you could possible think of, alluding or directly spoofing celebrities, famous events, movies, music. I think it is impossible to catch all layers and details of this movie in just one watching. Technically it's nothing special, but story is good enough to make everything else negligible. Even the worst scenes are fun, and those best and most shocking I had to rewind and re-watch several times, not being able to believe my own eyes and ears. I couldn't say it's one of the best animated movies of all time, but it definitely is the most original and bravest I've seen so far and I'm absolutely amazed.9/10"
" Flat
",2017-11-17 00:00:00,5,"Im giving 5 stars in comparing this animation to other good animation with good stories. First, the story is just mediocre, like an adult version of low budget toy story. Is not a breakthrough story, more like emoji movie kind of story. Second, I appreciate the idea of matching the story to nowadays issues, like religious and racial issues. I get the messages that they want to tell us about god and creation, human relations and love. Third, There is so many things that cannot make sense like how the foods walking, (while toy story make it more logical, like the toys is 'play dead' when there are human around.) Overall, this animation is not so bad about the meaning, but I can't really enjoy the jokes, really just flat emotions throughout the film."
" Vulgar, crude and clever
",2017-11-04 00:00:00,9,"Sausage Party was a major success for R rated animated films. Having a lot of hype and expectations gong into the film and during the filming process, Sausage Party exceeded my expectations as this film was well done and the jokes and humor match the point of the film. It appears many people found the jokes and humor in bad taste but it as meant to be as offensive, and it worked. The IMDb rating at the moment (6.2) is quite low as well the Rotten Tomatoes audience score (50%). Sausage Party can be defined as an R-rated version of Toy Story. Overall Sausage Party is quite clever and is constantly entertaining and funny. One of the more funny films of 2016."
" Total Garbage
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,1,(Spoiler Alert) the whole movie has spoiled!This movie must have been written by a pedophile! Why would anyone put an food orgy scene in a cartoon which is inevitable going to be viewed by children! Total sick twisted garbage! Should have been rated XXX. Seriously Hollywood is this what you consider entertainment? Don't waste your money or brain cells on this utter garbage!!!!! I wish I could stop this movie from every being seen again but I can't!!!!
" Incredibly Smart - Absolutely for Adults
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,10,"A movie that manages through the animation to touch important issues related to life. I felt like they present in a very smart way and metaphor the opinions related to some topics that are considered as taboo even in the modern society. However, I found it too much especially in the end, but this is a subjective opinion, so it will not affect my rating. In any case it is worth to watch this movie, as long as you are old enough...Who said that animation is for kids?"
" Awful, disgusting, poison,
",2017-10-19 00:00:00,1,"Dirty jokes can are fun, in jest, and situation comedy is fun. My life would have been better if I had not seen this movie. It is raunchy beyond anything I have ever seen... to the point it takes something away from your soul. (And I like raunchy, or at least I used to.) You are being punked if you watch this. Avoid it. Keep your kids the hell away from it... They will undoubtedly be damaged by it. I love all kinds of movies... every genre... There are only a hand full of movies I hate and I have seen most of them. I truly hate this movie. Beyond an absence of taste, class, or merit. Pure crap. Not one bit of redeeming value what so ever. Makes one feel like they have been raped. All copies should be burned and it removed from history."
" Funny but speechless
",2017-10-17 00:00:00,7,"At first i didn't know what i had to think about this movie..... I gave it a 7 because its very funny (if its your type of humor). To me there is not much of a story in it, and i don't understand why you put this type of humor in an animated movie? Its very sexist and if i would be a father i will not show it to my children until there are 12+ or maybe even 16+. Its a fun movie with real vulgar humor. It left me a bit speechless at the end."
" First they came for the bagel
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,8,"This is adult animation. Food products in a grocery store take on human qualities. They believe when they are bought, they are taken away by the gods to the great beyond. The film clearly bashes religious beliefs. It also uses stereotypes in great quantity for humor, such as playing George Michael when the fruits attack. I won't mention the taco. In addition to stereotypes there was a ton of sexual double entendre and crude adolescent humor and swearing. The film also incorporates non-sexual humor exploiting the Israeli-Palestinian problem and even Hawking. Movies were also spoofed for jokes. I will say I had a few LOL moments while some of the film was simply disgusting humor, especially the ending. James Franco plays the voice of the guy on drugs which then begs the question, ""Is Kristen Wiig a bisexual dating Seth Rogen?"""
" I wish if this movie never been out
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,1,"It was a very bad experience for me , i used to watch animation movies to laugh and relax but this movie is the opposite of that . In more simple words animation movies suppose to be pure and made for children , this movie damage the picture of animation movies we used to know .when i was watching the trailer i was very excited to hear the movie , but it turned out to be we have been miss direction by the trailer that does not explain the movie at all ."
" Funny & original but probably not to everyone's taste
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,8,"If you are thinking of taking your children to this movie, then don't; it is by no means a ""Disney-like"" movie. If you want to see something which is rude (I cannot think of any other animation movie in which the f-word has been used so frequently), original and very funny then you should certainly go. The guys who wrote the plot must either have been drugged or drunk (or both at the same time). I very much enjoyed it although some might find it too offensive."
" Pixars Adult Enemy
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,6,"It's an original idea for sure, but I wouldn't had payed to see it or buy it. I absolutely love almost everyone in the cast for this film and they preform a stellar job with the voice acting and especially provide a great dynamic range. I just found the film a tad boring overall, the jokes are very blatant and predictable, though I feel they missed a few ways to improve some of the jokes in the script. Overall, the composition, framing, colour palette and music in this film are great and stereotypical, but it does provide an opponent to an animated Disney movie if the script was more interesting but for adults, obviously. Not quite up there with Pixar though!"
" It was all fun and games until...
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,3,"Great cartoon for adults. I loved it right until the rape jokes. Like, come on, is it possible for people to make a funny movie without re-traumatising victims of sexual assault? Everything else worked, so I have really no idea why they just had to go that low. I wouldn't have bothered if it wasn't that explicit, 'cause it wasn't just scratching the surface, it was quite horrible. They should've thought it more through, instead of trying to make something (hopefully) only college- jocks find funny."
" What the heck?!?!?!
",2017-09-09 00:00:00,1,"This is the worst movie I ever saw! This movie is about a sausage who is sent on a quest to discover what the truth of existence is. This movie is so gross! This movie ruined my favorite actress, who plays a bun. I wish this won Worst Picture at the Razzie Awards. The acting sucks, the animation is garbage, the plot is stupid, and the music is lame. If you haven't seen this movie, don't! It will ruin your brain!"
" If only it were possible to give this film a negative 10 rating.
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,1,"This was quite possibly the worst film I have ever wasted 15 minutes on. I can't believe I even lasted that long, but for review purposes, I left it running (so I heard the dialog while I was doing other things useful with my time).I picked this up at the local library, not completely sure what to expect, but I knew of the origins of its writers and so I expected some crude sexual humor, a few laughs or maybe at least lightly amusing, mindless entertainment.I even thought that I might count how many times the ""F"" word was used in the first 5 minutes. It seemed like every single sentence. Hmm, couldn't think of any actual comical dialogue, so I guess they thought that by using the ""F"" word at least twice in ever sentence would add value to their pile of doodie ~ WRONG.There were so many opportunities for humor, but instead it was an animated waste infested with so much cursing, crudeness and so little thought and creativity that I am ashamed to continue play of this waste that included a cartoon rapist, drug pusher and racists as basis for laughs - not funny?I am mostly disturbed to see that over 130,000 individuals believed that not only did they think this was worthy of existing, but thought it was very good! What horror! The best part of the movie was the ending - because it was great music. Three Dog Night? How did such a good song end up in such a repulsive piece of garbage film?Did I mention I got this for free at the library? Remember, if you watch this it is not only an hour and a half of your life that can never get back, but a greatly regretful one. I'd rather have had someone smash my fingers in a car door and spent an hour at the emergency room than have watched this. At least while in pain waiting for care, I'd be entertained by the crackheads or meth-heads that wander into the ER for medical care. That would be far more interesting and entertaining than this heap of garbage."
" A lot of rawness but nowhere near enough sauce
",2017-08-29 00:00:00,4,"The concept was a pretty intriguing one and unlike any other concept personally seen before. Reading the very polarising reviews, mostly from audiences that had people defending it and others hating it with a passion, and being aware of what kind of humour there'll be and what to expect, there was no trouble knowing what to let myself in for.'Sausage Party', after seeing it, is not as bad as has been made out by those who hated it (understandably), there are redeeming qualities here and there are far worse animated films out there that are much more cheaply made, poorly conceived and offensive in their lack of quality. 'Sausage Party', with that being said, also could have been much more, an intriguing and unique concept with severely under-cooked and muddled execution. Crude, juvenile humour doesn't always offend me and am constantly saying how annoying the constantly spouted ""it's a kid's movie"" cliché needs to be nipped in the bud.It's wholly dependent on how the crude, juvenile humour is executed, 'South Park' is as crude, as bold and as controversial as one can possibly get but executes its very satirical, daring and takes-no-prisoners humour much more sharply and cleverly. How 'Sausage Party' executes its crude, juvenile humour is instead excessive, repetitive and gratuitous.Certainly there are good things. Have no qualms about the animation, which is rich in detail, colourful and quite inventive in places. The soundtrack is catchy. The voice cast is good, and even they alone are reason enough for anybody to know what to let themselves in for (Seth Rogan and Kristin Wiig are no strangers to the humour seen in 'Sausage Party').Nick Kroll and Edward Norton, the latter's dead-on channelling of Woody Allen being the most inspired the film gets, are particularly good. Rogan and Wiig also bring personality to their roles. There are parts that are inspired and equally horrifying and hilarious, like the scene with the can of spaghetti spoofing 'Saving Private Ryan', and some witty dialogue but it's Norton's Allen channelling that provides the biggest laughs.However, too much of 'Sausage Party's' writing falls flat. The cussing and sexual raunchy innuendos epitomise excessive and gratuitous (some of it is very out of place as well), while the vulgarity is not as witty or as clever as it likes to think and some of it is very repetitive. The dialogue makes one cringe more than laugh and completely lacks wit or fun, it's just dumb and insipid.For all the voice cast's best efforts, the characters are either bland or annoying with little personality or development. 'Sausage Party' started off well but wore thin quickly and felt very over-stretched. It's not a long film, but the thinner the concept got the more of a long haul it felt. The story does not have enough to sustain the length and apart from a few moments of genuine inspiration it's dull and under-cooked to the point of rawness and with not enough fun to give it sauce.Overall, not that bad but rather lacklustre and could have been so much more. Loved the concept, no matter how silly it could easily have been, was underwhelmed by the wanting execution. The low rating is with regret, and with knowledge that, along with the other less-than-positive reviews, will be blasted by those vehemently, ignorantly and condescendingly defending the film (thinking that only their opinion is right and everybody else is wrong). 4/10 Bethany Cox"
" I'm 14, But Who Cares, Right?
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,10,"I might be 14 and not really allowed to watch R-rated movies like this, but who cares? I still watched it and found myself to love this movie. While most had no care in the world for this movie, some actually enjoyed this movie. They probably came for the last 7 minutes, though. I actually enjoyed that part of the movie somehow. Man, food sex is so hardcore. But anyway, the weird characters, the weird plot, everything is weird about this movie, and somehow I liked it."
" Hilarious!!...if you're twelve.
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,2,"How could anyone over 12 possibly find any of this funny? The movie is planted with way too much sex jokes, drugs and curse words. Believe me, I'm not against these sort of things when it comes to comedy, but this movie overdoes it way too much. You know those 11 year olds on Call of Duty cursing and making adult jokes like crazy in a cringy attempt to seem older? That's this movie. Instead of actually using real humor, the writers thought that adults would crack up every time someone dropped the f-bomb (which, btw, is every sentence). Way too much effort in making this adult theme, not enough effort in producing good content. The plot had potential, but it was executed awfully. I don't normally rate things so low, but this movie is godawful."
" haters gonna hate
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,9,"Man I died laughing so hard watching this movie. I can't believe all the haters... what did you all expect from Seth Rogen?

I liked it so much it's my IMDb profile pic!9/10 for this bad boy from the Top Dawg!"
" Do These People Know Anything About Good Comedy Writing?
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,2,"When I saw the trailer, I thought this was going to be a good movie. At first, it would seem like a kids film but then trick the audience later on. But once I got to actually see the movie, the jokes were nothing but swearing and sex references. Basically, within the first 30 seconds, you hear constant F bombs and sexual imagery. Heck, even some of the characters are shaped like genitals to further display the sexual imagery.Another thing that's a huge turnoff for any movie goer is that most of the characters don't even have well-written personalities or any personalities for that matter. Instead, they just use walking stereotypes such as the bagel being Jewish and the lavash being Muslim. Not even the main characters have anything about them that makes them likable in any way. All the main characters want to do in the end is have sex with each other. Sure they want to know the truth about what happens to food, but the whole entire ""plot"" for our main characters is based on sex.I forgot to mention that during the film, one of the scenes involves a douche raping a juice box to drink its fluids. Why would they feel the need to add in a rape scene like that? And then comes the ending scene where everything is having sex in a huge food orgy. I'm dead serious. Good writing for comedy shouldn't be based on just sex and vulgarity. I mean look at South Park, it's not all about sex and vulgarity in each episode, some of the episodes have an actual plot, heck even the movie had a plot. True, it was based around swear words but, not every character swore in every single sentence to try and make it sound funny.This film was not even written with understanding what makes adult comedy funny, I feel as if this was written by a 12-year-old boy who just discovered what porn is."
" Terribly nauseating film, and not just from the gross-out humor
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,3,"Even for a movie called ""sausage party,"" it is incredibly nasty. I knew, with no doubt, that this would be, even for a rated-R film, a risqué showing, for obvious reasons, but my god...this is our comedy today? Seth Rogan did okay in ""The Interview"" and from what I know, that's about it. I do not know where to start, it's just wrong in every single way, the moral (and the way they taught it), the sex scene in the end, the rape scene with the douche and juice box, the lack of logic in the plot, the abundance of (extremely) boring and repetitive sex jokes, most of these jokes in general, the random weed smoking scene, the highly extreme liberal bias (I'm a liberal myself, and I do not appreciate Rogan giving us such a bad rep with this propaganda, nor the one-sided ""lesson"" that ""religion sucks, lets just f*** each other"" with this terrible comparison with this plot and actual religion, nor do I like you over-generalizing religious people as all being these brainwashed and ignorant bigots, who you just so happen to not agree with.)I love offensive humor (guilty pleasure lol), I believe that non-pc humor can be fun to watch or listen to, for there are ways of taking a very sensitive topic and bring the humor out of it, however, in most cases, this movie doesn't do that. There were a few clever jokes I liked (""exterminate the juice"" ""72 extra virgin olive oil (quoted from the lavash, who of course represents the Muslim/Arab community, I just hope the people who had written that joke is aware that the '72 virgins in paradise is an Islamic belief' myth isn't even mentioned in the Qur'an anywhere. I'd like to hope that they were just making fun of a common stereotype/misconception of Muslims and their belief, but from the movie's message exclaiming that, 'religions are bullcrap' I feel as though these gullible and misinformed writer actually legitimately thought that this is actually a thing that they believe in. Idiots. At least it was funny though, would be more clever if it actually true.)"" ""baby carrots"" ""bath salts exposing the fact that the food can talk"" and a few others I can't think of) But the rest is predictable, unoriginal, and immature. So instead of laughing, it only pisses you off. Just because a comedy is edgy doesn't mean it's good."
" Nothing more than just a limp wiener.
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,5,"Sausage Party was probably one of the funnier movies I have seen this year, yet its mediocre storyline, and villain kept me from truly enjoying it. It is definitely a rated R film, and if you're not into sex, drugs, and cursing, than this is not your type of movie. So in the end I decided to give Sausage Party and ""Alright"" on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. Although it gave me a good laugh at times, it was nothing more than just a limp wiener.Read more at theVade."

I was very much looking forward to seeing it, and after seeing the trailer, I thought this was going to be one of the best animated movies 2016 will bring to the big screen. I was wrong.I didn't get to see it in the cinema so when it came out on Blu-Ray - I bought it straight away. I only recently watched it, and now I feel so stupid, not just for losing my £15 but for also wasting nearly 2 hours of my life. I will not spoil the movie as there are so many more detailed reviews you can read about what actually happens, but the one thing I would like to say is that this was a missed opportunity.The life of our food and their journey from the supermarket to our homes - sounds like a good concept. Shame it wasn't executed right, and rather than funny, we got a very silly movie that I can't wait to sell and not watch every again."
" Not that good
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,3,"Honestly, the best parts of this movie are in the trailer. The scene everyone was waiting for, where the food is obliterated by the woman in the kitchen, is like 30 seconds long. It's kind of funny seeing a pixar-looking movie filled with this content (sex, drugs, profanity), but after a while you can tell they are going for strict shock- value, and the jokes really hold no meaning (after seeing a hot-dog say F*** 100 times, it loses its luster). This movie has moments where I laughed, but was not as funny as the trailer made it seem. In fact, it got stale real quick, and is much more political than I would of preferred. The ending, was actually gross, and not really funny at all. I am all for crude/tasteless-humor, but the **SPOILER** orgy at the end was strictly for shock, and had no context whatsoever. Honestly, if they made some of the funny scenes in the trailer as long as the orgy scene, it may have gotten a better rating from me. ""Foods engaging in sex hehe""...3 minutes later...""okay how much longer is this going to go on for?"" Overall, this movie was marketed brilliantly, but did not serve up to my expectations. Poor job, the Freaks and Geeks squad have been on a downward spiral as of late. We need another Superbad or Pineapple Express soon."
" i do not recommend
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,4,"I went to this cartoon thinking it was some kind of ""Happy Tree Friends"" but with food. It has never occurred to me that I will rethink my list of the worst movies that i have ever seen. Within 90 minutes you hear pornographic jokes, pornographic jokes and pornographic jokes, and if you are not tired yet, the animation gives you the opportunity to finally see those jokes alive.Personally, I would fire the people who wrote this script, or those who approved it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!"
" Heavy, not funny
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,2,"Honestly, I wanted to watch this film out of curiosity, especially after the ""bad buzz"" it suffered in France, I thought that this film could have some allusions to sex but would still have a humorous potential, but no. I want to see a movie of Rogen and Goldberg, we're not going to see a smart film, we're going to see a film with a silly wittiness, but this movie is just not funny, I'm not shocked by the sex scenes, however, they are only food, and that's still sausages that cram loaves of bread and there are much worse on some sites, that does not shock me, but the vaginal shower in the guy's anus is not too much? Afterwards, the ""intelligent"" side of the film, with the aspect of religion and more generally of the beliefs is not bad but it is not developed enough for my taste and one senses nevertheless that it is not the basic principle of the film even if it remains interesting but unfortunately the film remains too focused on sex, from the first scene, in song, to the last, orgy, passing by the part ""smoking joints"" and I do not see the point of making a whole movie, it's just ""too much"". In fact, the biggest problem of this film is that it started on a few funny ass jokes and it quickly became jokes of ass not funny because they are too present, therefore not funny and heavy. Finally, I put 2/10 for this movie because it is not worth 1, it is well staged, well done, the background ideas are good but it is just a raving and for me, it does not passes. Just heavy, not funny!"
" Not for kids!
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,6,"Some people still think kids movie when they see an animated US production. And that is mostly the case. Just not here as you will see if you watch this. It was clear for those who followed it, what it would be. Well maybe not exactly what it would be, but you knew what direction this was taking.A very adult and dirty minded one. Another reviewer correctly called this out on its ""jokes"" and obscenity. Although if you are offended by the first couple of minutes and innuendos, than you better not watch until the end. The last 10 minutes or so went places ... all at once. Even though it wasn't being soft before, this really went way overboard. So if you can lower everything down (pun intended) and just let yourself slide into this ... experience, you might be able to have fun with it. Though again this is very special .. in its craziness."
" I just want you to know that This Film was pure Poopy
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,1,"I just found this film on Netflix a few weeks ago and I decide to view it since I could't find anything else to watch. I knew for a fact that it was going to dirty, but that didn't make a difference! I saw a lot of dirt stuff worse than this but as for the plot, well it was like a lot of people was posting on here. I did not laugh at any of this film either. I know that it can be amusing that scene about the dope head scene. But really! I can watch Toy Story over and over( which is better and more sense)................."
" Like being trapped in the mind of a pervy twelve-year-old
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,1,"Okay, first off, I'm not a prude, and honestly a few politically incorrect jokes here and there doesn't cause any harm. The problem with Sausage Party is that it's trying to be edgy and innovative by being so excessively low-brow and offensive that it just becomes annoying. Watching it was like reading the comments section of a YouTube video. The ""humour"" in this film consists mainly of sex jokes, a rape joke that really crossed the line, swearing non-stop, non-stop jokes about the correlation between sausages and pen!ses, and this more or less sums up the whole film. It's nothing we haven't all seen before, but it tries to pass itself off as some groundbreaking animated comedy masterpiece when in reality, it's just repeating the same stuff we've all seen time and time again. If you've watched Family Guy, you've seen Sausage Party. If you've watched Eating Raoul, you've seen Sausage Party. If you've ever read the diary of a nerdy junior high school boy, you've seen Sausage Party. I will concede that it had one or two genuinely hilarious moments, but these were so few and far between that it simply wasn't worth the time. I'm not the biggest fan of low-brow humour, but if they had at least been more creative with it I would have rated this piece of garbage much higher. There were also some bizarre atheist undertones that I'd rather have not had shoved at me. I didn't go to a comedy film to get a lecture on religion or lack thereof. At least animated films like Fritz the Cat were creative and witty when it came to satire, instead of just blatantly rubbing it in viewers' faces. I am completely shocked that Sausage Party has a current 7/10 overall rating on here. I find that fact itself to be more laughable than the film."
" Personally funny, ruined by excessive South Park-Esq language and food puns.
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,7,"Sausage Party was something I wanted to see for a long time; an R-rated computer animated (CGI) movie. It involves food products in a supermarket who believe that they are taken by ""Gods"" (human beings, shoppers) to the ""Great Beyond"" (which is paradise for them).A sausage named Frank is in love with a bun named Brenda, they (along with friends, quirky Carl and the small and short Barry) are taken to the ""Great Beyond"" by a woman named Camille Toh... but a returned Honey Mustard warns the disbelieving foods (with the exception of Frank) that the Great Beyond is not what they believe it to be. This culminates in Frank failing to save the suicidal Honey Mustard and him, Brenda, and a few other foods falling out of the cart. What goes on from here is strange, intense, and on the occasion funny.The ending... I don't want to get into the ending.The movie is admittedly funny as I do laugh at some of the jokes here and there and the kitchen scene in which the remaining shopping cart foods are most certainly screwed. But the excessive swearing (the first couple of lines remind me of the beginning of South Park's first episode, which is a bad thing mind you) and lame food puns ruin the comedy for me and the plot could've been amazing if Frank and Brenda were with Barry on the way to the house or otherwise.The movie is okay and great, but it could've been improved with less language and more mature themes. The ending was also weird, disgusting, and strange but I can't really criticise it."
" Not what it could be
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,2,"After watching a movie, the first thing I think to myself us ""Why was this movie made? What were the writers trying to get across to the viewer?"" Honestly, the only reason for this movie to exist that I can think of is to push the boundaries of what we precise as decent. Personally, I'm not a big fan of movies that only exist to be raunchy (as you may be able to tell), but this movie is different. The way they try to sexualize food, and build sexual tension between food items hits every nerve in the human body that evokes disgust. Now, that's one reason to dislike this movie, but that's not why I dislike it. The reason I dislike it, is because it takes itself too seriously. The minute they tried getting preachy, or incorporating social commentary, I couldn't stand it. Imagine someone walks up to you, Jacks off in your face, and makes a bunch of crappy jokes about rape, and then suddenly tries to talk politics with you, and expects to be taken seriously. That's how it felt watching this movie. As an audience member, I felt insulted that this was the mental standard I was being held to. In conclusion, if I were to use one word to describe this movie, it would be 'pretentious'. It was clearly made by a bunch of rich people with no talent who just wanted to push boundaries, and spark controversy. All in all, I would rate 2/10."
" Not great but surprised
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,5,"I watched this movie with low expectations; I was surprised that it wasn't that bad. It's not as dumb as I thought it was although the message was a little more obvious than other movies. Even still it deserves props for having any, I will not say the message here it's much better when you see it you will understand everything it tries to say. If you're looking for a great movie this isn't it. If you need time to kill this movie is a little fun."
" I blame Steh Rogen for this
",2017-05-05 00:00:00,7,"I did like this movie. I would have made it myself if I had the resources. Here's what I liked -- I've had thoughts myself of what food would think of us if it were self-aware. I loved that concept.Here's what I didn't like...I don't know why, but Seth likes profanity too much. He doesn't use it artistically, he just keeps throwing one profanity after another until the words lose all meaning.Hey, I'm no ""prude"", I like the f'ing f-word as much as next mother f'er. But, there's a f'ing limit until you get f'ing sick of f'ing hearing that word. ;) Here's what I ask film makers -- limit profanity to an artistic level. It makes the movie better for us all, and more fun. This was a good concept but ruined by overused profanity."
" If it didn't have the R rating, it might have been better...
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,2,"The whole buzz about this movie is seeing an animation movie with A LOT of swearing, some weird sex scenes, and basically- Being an R rated animation ''comedy''.As I was beginning to watch the movie, within the first minutes you're introduced to the swearing. At first it felt kinda weird, but then I realized EVERY SINGLE MINUTE someone says f*ck, and after only 10 minutes- I knew what I got myself into.The only pros about this movie is that the first few moments are kinda funny, and the animation is good. Other than that, this movie was a total waste of time.Throughout it's entire runtime, it heavily relies on it's R rating, to the point where it just gets annoying and pointless to keep watching.I truly think that if it didn't have the R rating, it might have been better, and I could possibly watch it to the end (Yeah, I stopped watching after 30 min)."
" Layered, onion style
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,8,"Many people see this movie as ""extremely and excessively vulgar"", and I can see their point of view. I agree, it has all kinds of ""toilet humor"" (even literally), but when you scrape off some surface layers, it has a strong message.The story is about food that is convinced there's a new life beyond the store's door. The movie itself is the satire of the current society we live in, mostly alluding on religious and racial prejudice. The main protagonist, Frank (this is obviously a ""Jesus character"", since both of them hide ""truth"" behind their name) discovers that ""god's"" are not the way they're presented. Although the fruit believes there's ""fruit heaven"" behind the door, and they talk about it religiously, they soon find out that they've been lied to all the time. Frank comes with the proof of it (although all other supermarket products are skeptical at first), they unite despite their differences, conquer ""god's"" (humans) and at the end have an orgy of a life-time. Since they're basically obsessed with copulation, just like humans are obsessed with ""better life after death"", they prove that, if united, they can have their ""heaven"" before they go through ""great beyond"". I see this as a strong message to people to stop hoping for unknown tomorrow and enjoy life right now.Humor itself, word play, wise nice.F**k the Juice!"
" Great surprise, ecstatic, brilliant, explicit, NOT for Kids!
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,"What a great surprise! What a brilliant idea and brilliant implementation! Absolutely gorgeous, ecstatic! What else could you say? They put up the Volume constantly from 10 up to 120 Dezibel, ending in one of the best final highlights ever seen in film history. We loved it and had a great time. Thats more than enough to say. Make your own opinion. Go for it. Give it a try. It's worth, for sure."
" Could not be more topical
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,8,"If you are interested in religious, philosophical discussions and are not put off by sexual references or swear words do me a favor and go watch that movie!From a God-like perspective you are watching a small satirical model of our world and realise how pathetic recent religious conflicts, discussions and assertions seem. After most of Hollywood movies being religious crap, here the other side of the argument is presented. Most of the time you don't even need to read between the lines."
" No one should enjoy this film (and yet I did)
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,7,"There are some films which should probably come in blank DVD boxes. That way, when they're mixed in with your collection and you have friends or family round, they will never know that you really enjoyed watching an animated sausage discover the meaning of life in a supermarket by indulging in everything from murder to... I'll stop there when it comes to details (that's for the film's final act only).Yes, seriously, 'Sausage Party' is basically the polar opposite to all those delightful Disney/Pixar movies we've been taking our kids to over the years. Pixar films are delightful fun for all the family. Sausage Party is something you want to keep your kids away from for as long as possible. As I mentioned in the opening, a hotdog learns the (awful) truth about his existence. This particular hotdog is one of many different food types, all living in a supermarket (where else?!). Every morning all the foods for sale cross their fingers (yes, most at least have arms and hands, if not legs, too) and hope upon hope that a friendly human will 'choose' them for a better life in the great beyond (basically through the supermarket's sliding entrance/exit doors). Naturally, our hotdog (voiced perfectly by Seth Rogan) soon realises that his 'perfect life' will ultimately involve being roasted alive before being ground up in a human's mouth and then pushed out through the afore-mentioned human's rear. Hardly an attractive ambition for a sausage in love.Therefore, he – and his various buddies – set on a plan to escape this. At first it's a little hard to work out where this film will go. It's almost entirely set inside the supermarket and you may well wonder if this setting gives the film enough scope to really go anywhere. I'm pleased to say that that's an incorrect assumption. It never really lets up for a moment. The (very adult) humour comes thick and fast and, if you've seen any other recent Seth Rogan movie, you'll know to expect much profanity, sexual references and the – seemingly obligatory – getting high scene.You may not be able to tell some of the actors who have leant their vocal talents to this film by their performances, but Edward Norton and Salma Hayek are both newcomers, along with Seth Rogan's usual bunch of suspects such as James Franco and Jonah Hill. If you're into their collaborations then you should enjoy this. It's hard to imagine it will ever be that successful as the concept is just too 'niche' to ever get a mainstream following. It's definitely not one to watch with your grandmother, but it is extremely gross and adult fun if you're in the mood for that sort of entertainment.Oh, and as a Meat Loaf fan, I loved the 'Bat out of Hell' sequences, but that's probably just me."
" Sausage Fest
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,5,"Living in blissful ignorance, the food products at a small supermarket consider a revolt after learning that humans buy them to eat them in this animated comedy that purposely pushes the boundaries of good taste (pun intended). While it raises unanswered questions galore, the basic premise is not half-bad and touching on issues of racial intolerance, religion versus atheism and sexual repression, the film even has a couple of good ideas. Most of the intelligence is, however, obscured by the film's penchant for gross-out gags and so much sexual innuendo that one can only wonder the biological purpose of food copulating. The high amount of swearing and obscene language does not feel natural either. With a swear word inserted into almost every line, it often feels as if the filmmakers simply thought that the idea of food swearing was funny in itself. Same goes for the excessive long scenes of the food products getting high. The film is not a total waste though and it is actually rather funny in parts with some very good vocal work. Top credit goes to Edward Norton for a spot-on impersonation of Woody Allen, with David Krumholtz equally as effective in his banter with Norton. There is some neat fourth wall breaking towards the end too if one can make it through without being deterred by the filmmakers trying (often too hard) to be as politically incorrect as possible here."
" Watching paint dry for 2 hours is much funnier.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,1,"I saw the trailer of this movie at the cinema and thought it might be worth going to see when it came out.Fortunately I never got around to seeing it in public but I did take it home on DVD as part of a special 3 for 1 movie night deal at my local video store.I must say this has to be one of the most pathetic movies I've watched for a long, long time. It's a soft core porn movie full of poo poo jokes and giggly childish sexual innuendo, with no real story-line.The ending is proof that they ran out of ideas or were off their faces on something. The movie relies on fart jokes or bong-head, off your face on drugs type humour to progress. There is no sophisticated laughs, no subtle humour in this what-so-ever.It is definitely not a young child's movie nor is it really one for adults either. Although due to their lack of maturity, 10 to 12 year old children will find it hilarious, especially the soft core porn scenes towards the end.I could not recommend this movie to anyone unless you have scrambled, or regularly scramble, your brains with drugs as this is the only way you would find it entertaining.The worst thing abut this movie: Everything from the opening credits to the final scene.The best thing about this movie: The closing credits.The copyright warning is the funniest moment which made me chuckle, because who in their right mind would even consider copying this garbage?"
" People need to chill
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,8,"Every negative review I've seen calls this movie ""insensitive"" and all, but if you actually loosened up you would find that this movie is actually hilarious. If you're looking for a movie to act offended by then congrats this is your movie. Fortunately, if you're someone like me who loves offensive humor then this is a perfect movie for you tooThe movie has a deeper meaning to it if you really focused in on it and it really isn't about attacking different races, but rather showing that every race and religion has flaws and if we just stopped caring about it then we would be able to accomplish so much more. People are too quick to get offended these days that they miss the bigger picture. The food orgy scene was definitely the most off putting part of the movie for me, but it overall does send a greater message than just that. There's so many levels of humor that it's hard not to enjoy. And if you're really educated, the arguments between the bagel and falafel are hilarious. So ignore the negative reviews and the people calling this ""racist."" Watch it for yourself and just enjoy it. Some racist humor can be funny if you're able to take jokes about your own race."

" Wonderful comedy that summarizes the nature of the human life
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,10,"*Possible Spoilers!*This movie will be emotionally rejected by highly religious people without a thought. Although the language can be quite shocking, the movie reveals the real nature of humanity and survival instincts. I like this movie because it was a different and brave show of cultural references like Freudian psychology, racism, antisemitism, the new look at modern science, and has connections to Stephen Hawking, and even critiques the distant spirituality in our consumerist society. The movie gives us a twisted view of the question ""What if you can be consumed"". With small pop culture influences and a great finale in reference to the world-recognized book by German author Patrick Süskind, Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, this movie turns out to be a great message to people who are real literates. The higher rating users give to this movie, the larger and more diverse is their library."

The cummwad that played Stephen Hawking was outstanding! Loosen up folks, I'm fairly sure that if an Excellent Adult comedy cartoon like this was aired on a regular Broadcast channel, everybody would be having the best and loudest laugh of their lives."
" lame jokes and way too many sexual innuendos
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,3,This might just be one of the stupidest movies I've seen this year. There were just way too many lame jokes and too much profanity in the movie. And most importantly; it just wasn't funny. I seriously couldn't laugh at any scene in the movie. The humor was just too one- dimensional. How any person with an IQ over 100 can find this funny is beyond me. At least 90% of all the jokes in the movie were sexual innuendos that I saw coming a mile away. There were also no memorable scenes in the movie.I like Seth Rogen but this movie was utter tripe. He shouldn't have taken part in this abomination of a movie.

It also shows aftermath of superficiality in life. It shows that there is a hope too. This is how I perceived it and it is an excellent work. So so good in many directions, wasn't even aware of seriousness of this movie, whilst looking at its cover :-D. Cheers! Enjoy watching it as I did. My vote is 10er out of 10."

" Never seen anything like this before....
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,6,"Prepare thyself. Sausage Party is unlike anything anyone has ever seen. This animated comedy is HARD R rated. By far the most explicit adult animation ever made. So please if you're going to watch then don't allow the children to be in on it. The movie starts off at a supermarket where we see all kinds of food items singing a song praising the ""gods"" (humans), because they believe the ""gods"" are good and nice and will give them everything they've ever dreamed of in ""the great beyond"". They all believe that ""the great beyond"" is when humans purchase them and bring them home with them. They soon find out though that this fantasy is completely false. The main characters are Frank the sausage (Seth Rogen) and Brenda the Bun (Kristen Wiig). They are in love and I liked wiig and rogen voicing them, good casting. All the hot dog wieners want to ""fill"" the hot dog buns in the great beyond. Fancy way of saying they want to have sex and lots of it. The comedy in the film is pretty hit and miss lots of the time. The movie is 1 hour and 20 minutes and I laughed three times. That is why I say it's hit and miss. The majority of the comedy stems from extremely crass/crude material, and very sexually explicit material as well. Sexual jokes and potty humor abounds. And so does profanity. F**k, s**t, c**k, c**t, absolutely nothing is left unused as far as cursing goes, so just be prepared and know that that's what you're in for with Sausage Party. I didn't mind the cursing at all, I never really do with any movie, although I did mind the unoriginality to a lot of the comedy. A lot of the comedy is just very middle school, I think a lot of the times the writers just injected extreme cursing to get laughs. And that just wasn't very funny. I liked the characters and I thought the movie was funny a few times. Another thing I liked was how they handled the plot, it was surprisingly thought provoking. It's all about questioning what you've been fed as far as religion goes, actually looking into things for yourself, not just believing something blindly. And that's a good lesson. But then.... after a good message at its heart is displayed, there's a full fledged food orgy. Complete with thrusting, moaning, masturbation, BDSM, oral sex, and other stuff.... With all of this considered I give Sausage Party a 6/10. A few funny moments and some good characters, but there are better options."
" Crude.
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,1,"The trailers look that it was going to be a fun film. They were probably only non-R rated bits of the film! It's full of profanity from start to finish. Sexual innuendo and just plain sexual jokes. You can put up with a bit of humour like that, but this is 90 minutes of it and almost the entire basis of the film.I'm just glad I never talked someone in to going to the cinema with me to see this. I'd have been very embarrassed! Did I laugh? Yes, but more because I'd wasted my money on this! A dejected laugh of why am I wasting my time watching when there's so many other good films? Sadly, that reason was because I'd bought the disc...So it's a 3/10 mainly because the idea was good, the animation was good, but the constant stream of unfunny sexual jokes and unnecessary swearing isn't amusing."
" A waste of time
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,4,"I had hopes for Sausage Party, Hollywood has churned out some good animations for decades. However this is not one of their better animations. It was a perverse and sick film in the end, it started with promise but had an end that would suit sick perverts. We have had porn and soft porn but degrading animation with these sentiments is quite sad. The film had something that resembled a plot for most of it, it became dull and unfunny and it certainly saved its worst for last. It included a disgusting animated orgy that did no one any favours. I will never get those precious hours I wasted at the cinema, I could have been doing something better like nothing or staring at a wall for this time. This film would suit immature and perverted teenagers or troubled or twisted adults who get sick kicks from watching such a mess."

There are a lot of jokes that only adults would be able to understand but also contains very graphic gestures that you would not want your kids to see.

I look forward to the Brits cleaning up the script and producing their own TASTEFUL much wittier version. (Not that I'd bother watching it.) This intellectually obscene flick was painful garbage to sit through. Only watched it out of curiosity as how just how crude some American filmmakers can be just to make a buck."
" I wanted to like this
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,1,When I first seen the trailer I thought cool they are going to make something worth watching but when I actually watched the movie I was really disappointed. I am a Seth Rogen fan but this movie really didn't live up to the potential it had considering it had a lot of a list celebrities at it disposal. The jokes were not really there and there was not really a memorable scene in the movie other then the food orgy that was really unnecessary and seemed out of place. The ending was very disappointing as well I won't spoil it for anyone but lets just say it missed its mark.
" Wow, this is bad.
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,2,"Don't let the fact that several really wonderful actors and voice actors are listed on the credits. This thing is overwhelmingly weighed down innuendos and dirty jokes. Teenage boys and frat guys would like this; everyone else, pass it by. There's a stab at a plot, romance. It talks about how silly religious differences are. But that doesn't overcome all the sex gags. Endless sex gags. Endless. Please make it stop. I would have turned this movie off. My husband is a stickler for watching movies to the end. He panned it too. Wow, what a waste of time."
" An average movie
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,3,"This movie contains a lot of sex talk. Clearly this movie is a goof on love and sex. I found some of the screens to be amusing but others not really. This movie is 100% not for any kids. References such as ""F**K me"" ""hot milf"" etc appear throughout the movie. Over all this movie was funny, made me laugh."
" A graphic religious allegory (and not for kids)
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,7,"Nothing in the trailers will prepare you for this movie, including what it's actually about. SAUSAGE PARTY is an allegory about religion and how ridiculous it is, but also about how we can overcome our differences and learn to get along. Granted, there is no solution proposed nor does the humor rarely rise above obvious sexual puns and stereotypes (different foods represent ethnic groups, minorities, etc.), but the throw-everything-at-the-wall approach guarantees that at least some of it sticks. And importantly, for a comedy, there are plenty of genuine laughs to be had. Then there's the ending, which I will not spoil. Suffice it to say that it seemed oddly appropriate...and that you can get away with quite a bit more in an animated film than live-action. This wasn't the craziest or funniest thing I've ever seen, but it made for a few dollars and a couple hours well-spent."
" Vulgar, dumb, boring, disgusting
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,1,"I can definitely appreciate some harsh humor, since my life's experience and my taste both allow me to be just a bit slightly above a very-down-below-average docks worker (with all due respect), but nothing -- NOTHING -- can excuse this endless, POINTLESS, stupid swearing-for-the-sake-of-swearing.I watched some cartoons mostly intended for the adult audience. A number of them I disliked, some I disliked slightly less. Some I liked to a certain degree. But this one is a pile of scummy dirt that starts like dirt and ends up like a total rotten garbage.In short, this whole pile of trash does not offer any excuse for its existence. Even if one is far from any moralistic limitations, then this cartoon-flick is still entirely pointlessly dirty and dull. It is pretty much like saying f%ck-f$ck-f^ck and so on with no apparent reason, except for the one's who says this inability to pronounce any other words. Seriously.For the maker of this nonsense: this IS your last chance to start taking some good, Rx anti-psychotics. Better do it now."
" Can you be more unpleasant?
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,4,"The thing is, the movie, it could have been fine. It has a good rhythm and it deals with interesting subjects, but the problem is that I take for granted that to sell, the beginning and the end, to leave that flavor of the mouth is very bad. To engage certain viewers who like that kind of vocabulary and to remember that this movie says this.Then the rest of the movie, not bad, deals with issues like faith because if, like family, but never deepens.The animated films, has the power of, as it is done with computer, can narrate with a camera that you put where you want, very cheaply, at zero cost. However it is very typical that even so, they do not usually have much ingenuity to do it and this film is an example of it. The address is quite simple.He has a typical animated film picture, neither good nor bad.In spite of being short, to me, personally, I was made long, by the fact of the vocabulary."
" Do not recommend.
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,2,"This movie truly lacks substance and humor, it downplays rape and targets minorities for insensitive stereotypical jokes. The writers must all be white. The SOLE pleasure that came to me when watching this is the fact that they introduced 2 gay characters, a bisexual bun, and a lesbian taco. OK that's all this movie sucked"
" Don't even bother
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,3,"I thought I'd give this a try because there were so many famous people in it. Right away they start off with the cursing and sexual references. I thought, ""Ok, whatever, they're trying to show that this is for adults."" Nope, it is non-stop throughout the entire movie. I got up to where they have the Nazi food from Germany and the stereotypical-Jewish bagel and terrorist flatbread and gave up. If you like stuff like the South Park movie, where they just try to see how gross and raunchy they can be in a movie, you might like this."
" Unfunny and Repetitve Jokes
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,5,"Since most animations are targeted to children, it's always exciting to see an animation that is targeted to adults. While some adult animations like Anomalisa use an R rating to create a very serious and adult movie that seeks to send a message to viewers, others such as Sausage Party use an R rating to fill a generic story with vulgar language and sexual innuendos. While some aspects of Sausage Party are interesting, the comedy is very repetitive and gets old very quickly. So let's begin by addressing some of the better parts of Sausage Party:1.Animation: Since Sausage Party is made by a big studio, it is no surprise that the animation is pretty good. The various environments as well as the characters are very interesting and can be clever. However, there is one scene in the movie where it is clear that the animators reused another scene from the beginning in the movie, which seems really lazy. 2.Characters: While the characters themselves are pretty bland, it is interesting to see how the animators made characters out of food. Other than that, the characters are pretty generic and are a stereotype of certain races or cultures that are connected to the food item. Perhaps one of the best character in the movie would be Douche. The idea behind the character as well as the way Nick Kroll voices the character makes for perhaps the funniest scenes in the movie.3.Story: One of the weakest part of Sausage Party would be the plot due to being very predictable and clichéd. The plot revolves around the main character trying to find the truth and struggle to spread the truth to his friends. Overall, there's not much to say about the weak plot to Sausage Party other than its very weak and predictable.4.Jokes: Although Sausage Party is labeled as a comedy, the jokes aren't very funny. The jokes usually revolve around characters either cursing, making a joke involving sex, or a joke involving racism. As previously mentioned, the only funny bits come from Douche. After a while, the jokes become repetitive and stupid.In the end, Sausage Party is a ""comedy"" that has interesting animation and one funny character. However, the rest of the movie is either generic or repetitive and doesn't evoke many laughs.Final Verdict: 5/10"

" Subject: An Immature Movie With A Mature Message..
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,4,"WARGING POSSIBLE SPOILERS: OS= Not my usual type cup of tea, if it wasn't for the mature message I would have shout it off.Pros = 1. The opening song is a little amusing so say the least for me.I guess that is the a positive considering it's not Frozen or Moana or any kind of Disney film after all, far from it.2. I absolutely loved the animation in this it is shiny and glossy considering the type of message that they are trying to convey, I found the colour way too bright and cheerful in the light. And even in the dark it was still a little too bright for my tastes. I almost felt like I was watching a Toy Story movie. But as I have said the colour bright and vibrant, I some time like it and some times hate it.3. The metaphors to which the message this movie tries to convey are clear, the reason I added this to 'Pros' is because the movie doesn't force you to look really hard and try to catch every single one of those metaphors. And take you out of the movie experience and at the same time it's tell you that it's more than just a movie where things happen and you the audience supposed to laugh your but off at those brainless things. But in the end I feel that is exactly what it is a brainless movie where stuff happens and you are supposed to laugh your butt off at it. This isn't The Matrix after all, and I guess for that reason alone should earn it on the 'Pros' list. But at the same time feel that they think that we the audience are too dumb to look for those metaphors and figure them out. But I forgive it considering it's not supposed to be that way as I have said NOT The Matrix.4. Even this movie isn't my usual cup of tea I still found it funny in some parts when I had my brain turned off. More on that a little later..5. The Cultures of the ethnic products that they are supposed to represent I feel are very accurate, spectrally for the Mexican products.6. As before I feel the message of the movie is very clear, they literally spill it out for us the audience, the reasons for this to be in the 'Pros' is the same reason for the metaphors.Cons= 1. I feel they purposely go out their way to be crud and at time offensive, in the first five minutes alone after the opening song I have at least counted a swear word in every sentence. Just because it is an 'R' Rated film and a film that is targeted at young teens and Adulations DOESN'T mean that you have to be rude and crud every chance that you get in the film. Hare is a clean version of what I heard for most of the film if not all. ""What are F F. talking abut? I will F..ing F..you up. you M..Fer F..FF.."" I think you got the picture? And I felt it was like that through out most if not the whole movie.2. Be warned it is a little offensive to Mexicans, sorry I can't be more clear that that. I didn't specify in my notes. I think it's just for one scene I think? The following are either Hit (PROS) or Miss (CONS)= 1. It takes a while for the humour to kick in, for me at least. I didn't really start laughing until the 20 to 36 minutes into the film. And everything before it was like ""HA.HAHA.HAHA.HA..HA.HA.HA.HAHAHA..HAHA."" for me. Which brings me back to the humour thing, (Reference 'Pros' 4) 2. This movie to NO SURPRISE LACKS LOGIC, and what I mean by that is some things in the like a knifes do not move and are NOT alive, and other objects such as a Roll of Toilet Paper are. I wished they set a rule or a standard of what's alive and why and what's not and why. I don't know I guess that's a little nip pick I just have.3. This movie is rattled with 'Parodies' all over the place for NO apparent reason except in attempt to be funny and clever. Such as Stargate at the end or Terminator 2's T-1000 etc. If it DIDN'T work for Reboot well guess what? it DIDN'T work hare.4. The 'Calibration' after when the food products 'Defeat' the 'Gods' or the humans is what you expect for this type of Immature Movie. Well lets just say it's a type of group celebration you wouldn't take your kids to.CP= Overall at it's core it's still targeted at Immature Audiences ONLY! If you're looking for s thinking than just like me this IS NOT your thing. Like me I suggest you look else where for that because you won't find it hare."
" Raunchy. A cartoon NOT for the kids.
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,8,"Funny as Hell. You will never look at food the same way again. This cartoon movie takes place in your typical neighborhood grocery store. It stars a package of hot dogs and a package of buns who believe that when they are picked by the Gods ""the shoppers"" and leave the store they are going to their version of the land of Milk and Honey and will live happily ever after. Little do they know the real truth. A shopper returns a container of hot mustard and it tries to tell everyone that the world outside the store is nothing like they were lead to believe. The Gods are not kind but brutal evil beings that will murder and eat you. A shopper comes by and grabs the hot dogs, buns, the returned hot mustard, a bottle of douche and a host of colorful foods.The hot mustard is so distraught that he jumps out of the cart to commit suicide. There is an attempt by Frank the hot dog and Brenda his girlfriend bun to save the mustard. A crash into another shopping cart and chaos ensues. The rest of the film is divided into the outside world and what happens inside the store when it it closed for the evening. There is graphic depictions of what food goes through as a dinner is being prepared. There is the douche bottle who becomes a villain. There is more cursing than I have ever heard in a film, drug use, outright racism and an orgy scene that would make a porn producer proud and had my wife and I hollowing with laughter. Folks I have not seen this kind of cartoon since the classic Fritz the Cat. If you are easily offended stay away, but if you can just let loose and see the rough life our poor food goes through you will enjoy this film."

" My brain. It bleeds.
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,1,"Have you ever seen a movie so terrible you create an IMDb account *just* so you can warn the rest of the human race? How, god. HOWWWWWWWWW does this movie have even one good review.Sausage Party is that scrawny, rape-stach'ed white dude who struts into the bar with an exaggerated swag, dirty wife-beater, backwards snapback and sunglasses on who takes the mortified look on your face and repulsed ""no"" as invitation to continue grandiose-performing, flexing his lack of muscles in your face, and repeating the F-word ceaselessly (ground me now, mom!! lulz!!). Eminem did it once, so...When you signal to the bartender and try to escape, he follows you around... For an hour and a half. And just when you finally sigh in relief that your friends have come to save you, he hops directly in front of you and pulls down his pants.Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate some good crude humor. Family Guy. American Dad. Archer. All fabulous examples of dangerously crass, raunchy humor being pulled off remarkably brilliantly.But the word ""humor"" is more than a stretch here. (Wait, the douche is a douche? Is that what you said? No no, could you blatantly tell me that the douche is a douche? Because I didn't get that the douche is a douche.) Every racist stereotype under the sun is personified and paraded around as characters to make up for personalities that don't exist. The dialogue is flat and nauseatingly postured. The plot is predictable within the first five minutes and reeks of nuance-less anti-religious propaganda. There is an actual, entirely unnecessary rape scene. (Is rape funny to confederate-flag-sporting, sister-banging twats? Must have missed some memo.) I only made it up until the scene where a few of the characters come to a dirty Mexican bar (because, get it? Mexicans are dirty drunks??), but apparently the film continues its downward spiral right up to the point where they actually have an orgy. Take that, God.I genuinely cannot imagine this movie being funny to anyone with an IQ over 20. Maybe to bro-tastic idiots with seven rape allegations and a hate-crime assault charge who only get by cause daddy runs a big corporation and knows how to throw a tantrum.Please don't watch this bulls**t."
" What I expected
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"The Movie ""Sausage Party"" is a animated stoner comedy by Seth Rogan, the same man behind ""Pineapple Express"" and ""The Interview"", with the main setting in a grocery store called Shop-well with our main characters as sausages and Buns(no joke). When i first saw the trailers months before it came out in August of 2016 I wasn't pretty surprised with the violent horror movie fashion and repeated swearing of ""Fuck"" and ""Shit"" with the whole plot explained briefly in under two minutes. The store is where the movie mostly takes place with a sausage ""Frank"" (Seth Rogan) and his girlfriend Hot Dog Bun Brenda (Kristin Wig) with his friend Carl (Jonah Hill) the store's food are always alive and talking but humans can't notice their body parts and human-like movement Most of the food men are designed with cute cartoon gloves and eyes instead of realistic eyes and limbs, but most food woman are designed with realistic eyes and limbs which feels a bit sexist. The food believe the Humans are all gods that choose food to be sent to heaven and give them the chance to do some actual food porn (Again, no joke) Yet, the same day Frank, Carl, and Brenda are chosen, Something Goes wrong with the three being separated and we are greeted to new and ""interesting"" characters while Frank has to uncover the truth behind the ""GODS"" that actually eat them when they are chosen...That's all i will explain because of spoilers but this movie is what the trailer was swearing, Horror-themed food violence, and some other movie references. The movie has it's usual Seth Rogan stoner humor with some impressive animation, I will admit the animation is great. With some moments that could easily scare an adult with some gross moments I had, and that really did get me.Overall, Sausage Party is pretty funny film as what you expect from Seth and his other celebrity friends.It is not the best Animated Film despite some controversy that went on with the animators working unpaid overtime. The animation is both dark and impressive that has that real-world concept you can enjoy, and still be a bit sick about. We are also given that illusion where it is what if this object was alive and talking and this movie executes it well with how they describe background characters despite some other films with a similar concept.This adult film was pretty impressive with vulgar humor you might think is too much but it is better to forget. i will recommend this film for a couple of laughs and appreciate the acting, animation, and how it is executed like other Rogan Films."
" OMG! This movie is pubescent garbage.
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,1,"How do Seth Rogan movies still get greenlit? I thought the preview looked funny, and was willing to give it a shot... I was wrong. If you are a young boy between the ages of 11 and 14, then maybe you will laugh. Otherwise I highly doubt it. The jokes are so obvious and juvenile that they beg to question why anyone who approved the script still has a job. They seriously amount to a bunch of childishly crude sex jokes and some semi-offensive racial clichés. The stereotypes are both obvious and ridiculously unfunny. The jokes that aren't sex, toilet, or racially motivated are over-the-top, outdated cultural references. I get that Seth must be a cool guy (how else would he constantly get numerous stars to work in his films), but I just don't find him funny. There isn't one joke in this movie that is aimed at a person over the age of 15 or with an IQ above 75. If you like crude, unimaginative drivel, then this might be the movie for you. However, I cannot and will not endorse it. Ugh... I wish I had that 1.5 hours back."
" Sounds Exaggerated, But Maybe The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,1,"When I saw ""Knocked Up"" in 2007, I became a fan of ""Seth Rogan humor"", as I consider that film to be hilarious. Ever since then, I've usually had an ear or eye open when one of his projects comes down the pike. It was that thought process that got me into the theater for ""Sausage Party""...and experience that I sincerely wish I could take back. While perhaps not the worst movie I've EVER seen (but...maybe), it is easily the worst I've ever reviewed here on Amazon.For a basic plot summary, ""Sausage Party"" begins like ""Toy Story in the grocery store"", with all the different foods wanting to be ""chosen"" by beings (humans) they believe to be Gods. Frank the hot dog (Rogan) and Brenda the bun (Kristen Wiig) want to be chosen together (for obvious reasons) and that seems to be exactly what happens...until the plan goes awry and they become separated, having to decipher the mystery of ""the great beyond"" for themselves.I could spend oh so much time painstakingly going over why ""Sausage Party"" is truly an abomination, but I'll boil it down here to three main areas:1. It's wildly offensive, both in language and tone. I'm not terribly sensitive to the f-bomb being dropped in movies, but when it happens every couple words it is clearly just lazy dialogue. The whole ""we don't have anything really interesting to say, so let's just curse a lot"" sort of mentality. It is also one of the raunchiest films (in terms of content) that I have ever seen. Again, I'm no prude, but every single joke is of the most crass or sexual nature possible. 2. The whole thing wants to work as a critique of organized religion, but it falls flat (again, I think, because the crudity and profanity overshadow everything else). 3. The plot is completely and utterly pointless. It is mainly just these animated characters wandering around and finding themselves in bizarre and gross situations.Put it this way...as a person who thoroughly enjoys quality cinema, I am able to find not an ounce of redeeming value in this movie. Call me a snob if you will, but I enjoy shows like ""Family Guy"" and other low-brow pursuits. ""Sausage Party"", however, is what happens when you let Seth Rogan take ""stoner humor"" to its maximum (and then beyond).With the possible exception of ""Dumb and Dumber 2"", this is undoubtedly the worst movie I've seen in the past 2-3 years. Maybe I've seen worse in my lifetime...but maybe I haven't, either."
" It Smells Like a Dirty Diaper
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,1,"This turd floated onto NetFlix this week, that in itself says volumes. Great movies don't show up quickly or at all on NetFlix. But I gave it a look because while I don't have kids, I do have friends with children and they do not need to be exposed to this crap. Kids will ask to watch something and if you didn't know better, you might let them and have the legal system after you.The animated movie started by all the food singing about their various beliefs in religion. This is obviously anti-religion films to get a variety of groups upset and boost the hype. Sadly the only moral you come away with is; ""God or Gods don't exist. Have sex now with anyone, age, race, gender, or consent don't matter. Please yourself and get an orgy going because you are going to die and there is no reward except life itself. Do anything you want.""The idea that some nut has a religion trying to cram it down my throat sure doesn't appeal to me. Why does the creators of this crap think cramming atheism (another belief system) up my colon is going to be better? They did a bunch more stuff that was incredibly stupid and might I say irresponsible to promote as being ""cool"". Rape, bath salts, cannibalism, etc.. If I was a law enforcement officer after viewing this film, I would be keeping a close eye on those who took part in the making of this film. There is a criminal element here and it smells like a dirty diaper."
" Um...
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,1,"It was good until the orgy. No, seriously. It ends very poorly. Very badly.Weird. Just. Weird. I think I would have enjoyed the movie a whole lot more if it weren't for the end. Also, Seth Rogan in another movie where he's a stoner. Shocking."
" Didn't Find It Funny
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,3,"Maybe I need to watch it back again, but I was disappointed by this movie. I expected it to be exactly my kind of humor, but instead I just thought it was boring. Almost every Seth Rogan movie had been among my favorite comedies, but I don't think I laughed at all during this one. I don't think the fact that it was animated was the problem, because when I saw the trailer, I thought it looked good. Not only did I not enjoy it much, I can't even hardly tell you anything that happened in it, so it wasn't very memorable either. I can say that it looks terrible--the character designs are as unappealing as anything since Food Fight. I don't think that would matter if I liked the script, though."
" Horrid, irreverent, vulgar and crude
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,2,"This was a terrible movie from its very beginning. I am actually watching it now and considering not finishing the last fifteen minutes of it. How Netflix ever thought their viewers would benefit from this trash is beyond me. Thew movie is basically about how food, all of our food is actually alive, and it believes we humans are gods which come to take all food to heavenly paradise. When they realize we eat food and do not take it to heaven, they begin a revolt, which includes animated scenes of brutal human deaths including decapitation and anal sex with inanimate objects until people die.The movie is full of profanity, more than any movie goers would ever want to hear and almost every scene of full of violence, sexual innuendo and homosexual innuendo, all ending in an orgy of different foods having sex, giving fellatio and doing anal sex with each other.Aside from needing an X or maybe a double X rating, this movie is just plain disgusting in general. I gave a 2 out of ten because the voice actors did a good job of voicing their characters and the animators did a good job of animating, but that is generous as I can be with this tragedy."
" Amazing Movie!
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,10,"So I'm waiting for some immature meaningless comedy like normal Seth Rogen movies, and don't worry there is a lot of that but this movie blown me away. Besides the cringy humor about food puns the one big joke is how accurately this movie represents people. I can't give the movie too much credit because Plato beat you to the punchline a long time ago but good comedy points out fallacies and makes you think. If you think this movie is dumb you are only half right and on the other half maybe you should read more and be less ignorant. So what if it's immature humor, grow a pair and laugh."
" A strong concept marred by cliché
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,3,"The swearing has no effect by the end because the movie's so completely over saturated with it. The voice acting is predictable, bland. The plot is unadventurous. The CG is pretty weak, with minimal extraordinary detail. I do like some of the food puns, and the riffing on other movies, like the Saving Private Ryan part and the Terminator reference. It's a concept with much potential. Wasted on a poor script. The orgy part is pretty consistently funny too."
" Watched it as long as I can
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,2,"I do not want to believe the negative reviews, and also considered the positive reviews. I watched and put up with it until about 88 percent of the movie, and just couldn't continue to watch it. But here is the kicker, if you like vulgar, foul, and expletives, then this is a movie for you. Other than that, it would've been funny if the bad language was minimized, but just couldn't bear to watch it."
" Fun. Nothing more. And not for kids.
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,6,"So many 1-star-votes out there and this is still getting a 6.3 rating? Absolutely deserved. Why? Because there's enough people out there who understood that this is intended as pure fun and nothing more. All the people feeling *offended* by the *racial* profanity or otherwise are over-sensitive suckers. I especially liked the developing friendship between the obviously Palestinian (muslim) lavash and the Israeli (jewish) bagel. The sheer tidal wave of double entendres is amazing.One quote kinda grew on me: *Sausage, I relish (relish) the fact that you mustered (mustard) the strength to catch up (ketchup) to me.* Good stuff. Don't care what anyone says. Liked it because it's profane and dirty. 6.0/10"
" Eat mushrooms first.
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,1,"It's not very easy to find words to describe this movie. What is obvious, the World would be a better place without it. In general, I find Seth Rogen as some sort of Anti-Midas. Everything he touches turns into excrement. I read a few reviews of the movie (mostly very negative) but I decided to give it a fair chance. I'm not disturbed about jokes about religion nor am I very uptight about being politically correct. Maybe it's one of those misunderstood movies that are actually really good? Fat chance.What I, like many other reviewers, noticed first was the excessive use of curse words. Not that I have a problem with strong language but if it doesn't serve any other purpose than shock value, it's just lame. And truly lame it was in this movie. Then came the absurdly bad taste in jokes. Not bad taste in the sense of being vulgar or improper but childish, clichéd and simply stupid. I found penis/gay/racist jokes funny when I was twelve years old but not anymore, sorry. If you're an adult and watching this movie makes you laugh, I warmly suggest you take a good, long look in the mirror.Oh yeah, there was supposedly a deeper message in the movie about being open-minded and not believing what you're told at face value. It's just as bad as Damon Lindelof's sad dabbling with religious themes. Trying to make a very bad script have more depth by heavy-handedly inserting aspects about religion makes it only cluttered and worse.I did sit through the movie, mostly because I wondered if there would be even one thing that would make me laugh out loud. There wasn't. I snorted once or twice and that poor a reward is just not enough for the pain of tasting through the whole smorgasbord of absolutely untalented directing.By idiots for idiots, avoid at all costs."

",2017-02-18 00:00:00,2,"For those people out there who love classic Seth rogen dick jokes and all out profanity, sexual innuendos, pushing the limits type comedies will more then likely enjoy this because that is exactly what this movie is.Don't get me wrong, that is exactly what i expected when seeing this but i couldn't even fathom some of the scenes that i witnessed that practically made me sick to my stomach and had my jaw dropped to the floor in dread. I cant deny that some parts had me laughing out loud but after the first act is when the horror started kicking in.To start off with the good i have one main thing that i actually enjoyed and it was the satire about modern day view on religion and the many view points that can be had for religion. Basically the food sits in this grocery store waiting for the ""Gods"" to purchase them and take them to the beyond which is basically heaven. All this food sticks to a set of rules that they must obey if they which to reach this beyond aka commandments. Unfortunately one bottle of mustard gets returned to the store and after seeing the horror that is done to all of the food, he then suffers from food PTSD. The main character Frank (Seth Rogen) then goes on a journey to find out whether or not everything they believe is true or false. honestly this is an extremely raunchy comedy about a hotdog/person trying to figure out if god is real and if all the rules are necessary. By the end everyone learns it is all crap and that they can do whatever the hell they want thus bringing me to my negatives.Negative #1: i nearly puked watching a douche basically rape a juicebox. the music in the background and watching a douche go down on a juicebox sucking out all its juice and then proceeding to crush it to smitherines.Negative #2: food orgy at the end of the movie.......... how high do you have to be to think of creating an animated orgy with any food that you can think of......Negative #3: I feel that because they wanted to ""change"" animation for adults that the profanity was just WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! over the top and unnecessaryNegative #4: animation is nothing special in this movieOverall it has some laugh out loud moments but i cant even remember them because of how disgusted i was with this movie. i still give Seth rogen props for the whole satire on religion but that is it with this movie. nothing else is good about it."
" Sausage Party, nothing great from Seth Rogen but is just good
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,7,"I wasn't excited for this movie because i'm not for see a lot of R animated movies. But even i saw it, i liked it. There's a really fight between this movie if is good or terrible. The first thing of Sausage Party that the best of this movie is the voice cast of the movie who makes a great job in the voices of the characters like Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Nick Kroll, Micheal Cera, Jonan Hill, Edward Norton and others. The movie has some likable characters like Frank, Brenda, Barry and the villain Douche who has some of the most funniest moments of the film. The humor is a miss or hit. Sometime it can get hilarious moments, some others a funny moments and sometime really bad bad jokes like Kristin Wiig improvisation or so many insults. The score and the song ""The Great Beyond"" is great and they do have some of the best themes that i ever heard. And the last good thing of this movies are some thing of the animation like some of the takes are really good, some of the designs are decent and the backgrounds are great. But, it doesn't mean that everything of this movie is great, it has some problems. The animation is one of those. Even that is not the worst animation of all, the designs of the humans and the rest of the products are terrible. The jokes like i say, sometimes fail and when they are not funny, they suck. And all the orgy scene was the most boring scene of the movie. Is not funny or interesting so it doesn't have a purpose to be in the movie. So yeah, Sausage Party is not the best animated film of all, but is just good. I hope the animators get some justice for the idiot director Greg Tiernan who his role as a director of this one is terrible. Conrad Vernon makes a better job that him. For those who are interesting in this, i tell you that this is good for you if you are more that 16 years old to see this. For those who think is a kids film, don't be so idiots. This is a RATED R Movie. So don't show this for your kids until they have 16 years.7.3/10"
" A special kind of humour
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,6,"This is an animated story about the lives of some food that believes that when they leave the supermarket they enter Nirvana.This has quite a heavy Seth Rogen vibe about it. Expect a lot of lewd and inappropriate humour.The main character is a sausage who wants to enter Nirvana inside his hot-dog bun girlfriend.There are lots of clever play-on-words as well as a smattering of not so clever ones.I wasn't expecting a lot from this, and it was quite offensive, but I did find it quite funny and was an easy enough watch.The film reaches a high point about two thirds in then gets seriously dumb. The ending is absolutely rubbish. I wrote a similar ending for a story at school when I was about seven and my teacher made me rewrite it on the grounds it was utter cack.Not a great film but if you are a Seth Rogen fan you are sure to like this. If not, as long as you go in knowing this sails pretty close to the wind, you should enjoy it."
" Climax!!
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,8,"First of all never going to look at food the same way again. So its racist and offensive to everyone but it is hilarious. Some may say that it is immature. Hell yes it is. Seriously you should be at least 16 or 18 to view this. The ceiling is 30 as it may seem too crass and vulgar for those who watch 'Downtown Abbey', there is no problem in that because it is quite a good show.A man-child like myself, would want some crackers with my cup of tea. I have watched 'Food fight', which is in the IMDb bottom 100. This is far superior than that garbage. The puns were better here. Some puns were misses. Parts where I cringed were like the scene that may portray rape. One should hope that the audience is educated enough and not easily influenced by what they watch on TV. If someone does get influenced in the belief that 'rape is okay' from an animated movie about food items then he was a pervert to begin with. It is similar to the belief that 'women wearing provocative clothes are asking for it' and those who think that are medieval misogynists.The other part was the bagel and falafel scene (but that is just me, I maybe slightly homophobic), the orgy at the climax and most importantly gum.If Stephen Hawking gets offended by it then I would take his side on the lawsuit. A perfect description as per wiki is 'Gum, a Stephen Hawking-esque bubble gum wad in a high-tech wheelchair'. However it is a perfect metaphor for his condition, like being chewed up and spit out by the gods. If it weren't for that I would be giving this a ten but that is my opinion. So it is okay if people hate it or think it is a ten."
" Zany, irreverent, and foul: an all-star voice cast more than delivers
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,8,"""Sausage Party"" (2016 release; 88 min.) brings the story of a group of grocery store food items. As the movie opens 9with a glorious opening song), we get to know Frank Wienerton, a sausage, and his friends. They are all hoping that today will be the day that a customer will choose them, so that they can 'go to the great beyond"" (i.e. leave the grocery store). Then one day, indeed Frank and a bunch of other food items are picked and tossed in a grocery cart, only to see things go wrong at the last minute. Is Frank stuck in the grocery store? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is the brain child of Seth Rogen, who has for years been trying to bring this story to the big screen. Now finally a studio decided to fund it, and Rogen and his circle of friends came up with this zany, energy-jumping, extremely raunchy adult cartoon. ""We keep our wiener in our packages"", screams one of the sausages, and that's one of the more benign sexual double-entendres that pepper the movie. I assume you know yourself better than anyone else, so if this is going to bother you, do yourself a favor and stay away from this. I don't understand the many screaming headlines in other reviews that this is not for kids. The movie is rated R, so why would anyone even think about having kids watch this? The movie sports an incredible all-star voice cast: besides Rogen himself (in not one but two voice roles), there are Kirsten Wiig (as Rogen's girlfriend Brenda), Jonah Hill, Bill Hader, James Franco, Paul Rudd, Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, and many more. I mentioned the rounding opening musical number, and as it turns out the music is from none other than multiple Oscar and Grammy award winning composer Alan Menken, as well as Christopher Lennertz.Bottom line: ""Sausage Party"" is not for everyone. But if this is something that you think you might enjoy, it doesn't get much better than this this. The movie did much better than expected at the box office, and Rogen has already been quoted as saying he's been thinking about a sequel. Can't wait for that: ""Sausage Party 2: The Wiener Works""?"
" I thought it would be crap, but I didn't foresee the racism
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,1,"Yes this film is crass, puerile and ridiculous, but that doesn't have to be a problem.A few minutes in, we're presented with a bagel and some sort of middle-eastern flatbread portrayed as the stereotypical Jew and Muslim respectively, to hugely offensive effect, in my opinion. Every line in this scene is clichéd, with the Jew (coming off much more positively than the Muslim) shown to be quirky, deferential and ""passive aggressive"", and the Muslim your common or garden misogynist. Due to the foregoing, I turned this dross off and sought something more adult... Toy Story.If anyone else bothered with the rest and begs to differ, whoopee for you.Don't waste your time."
" Extremely underrated
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,8,"I saw this movie after hearing a lot about it and believe me I wasn't disappointed. The voice cast is just superb. Right from the first minute it is very easy to root for the characters which is commendable because after all they are just, things. I was really surprised to see it get a low rating but then it made sense. A lot of people might hate it for its completely unapologetic and honest look at modern religion and unlike Zootopia, it doesn't really cave in for the sensitivities of the audience. So it's bound to get a bit of hate. The ending might not have worked for some people but for a subject like this, it was a really outrageous one and I guess that's the point. I would watch it again just for Bill Hader and Edward Norton!"
" Actually shopping for food is a more thrilling experience...
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,4,"SAUSAGE PARTY is a good movie in the same way someone might describe McDonald's as being a satisfying meal. There are laughs, you get what you paid for, but in the end you leave feeling a bit sick for enjoying it and vow to change your eating habits before next time. I mean viewing habits. Seth Rogen's stoner homage to Disney & Pixar is surely filled with moments that will make audiences gasp and laugh, but if we are going to watch an R-rated animated film about talking food, is it bad for me to ask for better quality?When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was unaware it was an adult-themed movie until about midway through. We see a hot dog weiner flirting with a feminine-looking bun, and I recall thinking this was a bit risqué even for a kid's movie. Then came the carnage and I understood. The basic premise is that food is alive. When we purchase it at grocery stores, they know little of the horrors that are soon to come. Humans are merely gods who are here to take food into the glorious afterlife. They even have a song welcoming our arrival each morning.It's the Fourth of July so Bun and Weiner (I forget their names, but wouldn't that only confuse you?) are excited to finally get to spend time together. They are packaged near one another, and dream of the day they are finally selected to go to the great beyond. As plot would have it, they are purchased, but by a strange twist of fate, they esape their packaging and roll away in a deadly two-cart collision. The rest of the hot dogs go home to discover the true horrors of dinnertime, while Bun and Weiner meet some friends at the store (a Jewish bagel (complete with Woody Allen's accent) and a Middle Eastern flatbread, complete with beard). Their plan is to return to packaging to be sold tomorrow.Remember ""The Interview"" and the buzz that was built up prior to its Netflix release? What a disappointment the film ended up being, and in many ways this movie measures up just as well. A sort of passion project for Seth Rogen over the past 10 years, it's sad to think this is the end result. The plot is meandering and the situations these foods find themselves in uninteresting. The dialogue is a barrage of the ""f"" word if for no other reason than the film is rated R. There's also an extended sequence where Weiner and some other non-perishables get high (what can we expect) and an ending that is quite literally a grocery store orgy.There are laughable parts (a piece of chewed up gum as Stephen Hawking was brilliantly done) and some unfortunate parts (the film spends a large chunk of time joking about the political and global status of Israel), not to mention a barrage of racial jokes that are at times off-putting. The movie is an admirable effort to make animated features more for adults. Apparently adults can't get enough potty humor. Watch the trailer - the funny parts are there. The rest of the movie is fluff."
" A very creative idea ruined by disastrous application!
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,4,"The trailer used to promise a lot but then when it came out the reviews suggested that this film hasn't quite set the world on fire, so I was watching it with zero expectations but looking for some laughs. If you think about the idea itself, the fact that foods, drinks etc. have lives, they talk, see etc. and are like humans or animals, one can't resist being fascinated by it, but the application left a lot to desire.The first 20-25 minutes were a total headache really, with every phrase filled with the F-word three -four times - it was beginning to drive me mad but then once they get out of the market the film gets better and finally funny. The Arabic Sheikh style lavash was the funniest character, as was the physically disabled chewing-gum on the motorised wheelchair. Some jokes were really funny during that particular phase of it.BUT!Then the film-maker seemed to end the film in a fashion that made it resemble to a drawing by a child who does his job neatly but then draws random lines on the paper to ruin his work just because he has set his eyes on the toy lying next to him. That war between them and the humans was plain needless, but the porn film-like ending takes the cake! It was just disgusting and garbage. Really hated it!As a footnote, it didn't sound pleasant to the ear them abusing ""gods"". They should've simply shown humans as humans, opposed to gods. It felt awful to the ears.Overall, in short, a creative idea ruined by poor application. It had its occasional funny moments though."
" I hate myself for thinking this would be good
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,2,"Before I start this review I'm telling you that I generally love Seth Rogan's sense of humour and all of the actors that were voicing the characters I love as well, but this movie made me cringe. The entire plot of the movie sounded great and watching the trailers definitely caught everyone's attention, and it's not that often that an adult animation comes out and gets that much hype. It had a really good unique idea. The voice acting and animations were done really well. That's about where the positivity ends.The first time I tried to watch it with my boyfriend, and we shut it off after the ""rape scene"" with the douche and the juice box about 15 minutes or so into the movie. I mean, I can get how it can kind of be comical because I mean, it's a douche and a juice box, but just the fact that they were trying to compare it to rape was a bit screwed up and made me uncomfortable.The second time I tried to watch it was with one of my friends who swore it was hilarious and we just had to watch it so I was forced to watch it and finish it. The entire time she was laughing at every stupid and lazy attempt they made at humour and I was sitting there straight-faced wishing it was over.I have a pretty good sense of humour but the constant sexual jokes in this movie weren't even clever at all and they were pretty pathetic.. the kind of twelve year old boys make when they try to make everything sound sexual. I was happy when I thought movie had finally come to an end when suddenly all the food randomly started having this massive orgy which was another 5 minutes of pointless ridiculousness.Honestly, this had a good idea but just turned out to be complete trash, and not the funny kind. It was just pathetic and sad that people wasted so much time and money to create it. If you have this certain sense of humour that finds absolutely everything funny, you'd probably laugh a few times. If you're like me where it takes more than some weak sexual innuendos and over-the-top deaths to make you laugh then please do yourself a favour and skip this one. Everyone I know that has seen this (except that one friend) hated it."
" The Rated R version of Pixar
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,10,"Now I gotta say, this movie got guilty pleasure ratings. well the Animation is still better, but this is confusing people, this movie starts off on that dangerous nightmare called Shopwells, (S#*t said Frank) I'm not aware they put effort in this movie about how both Good or Bad, Best or Worst.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SPOILER ALERT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Why are foods are moving, Ghost?Why do they kill people on purpose!They thought religious people are gods, but we are Humans because of Jesus and other angel people when humans in heaven and earth, Food people thought there going to die in hell, but they died when they went into the humans body, and now they went into the Toilet since there dead.1 problem about this movie, why did you animate moving food when humans thought there ghost, but I'm asking you if it's still a flop on the box office even it failed a little bit or no.This Movie is more confusing for adults but it's just a made-up movie where Fire Water says that where cartoons but showing this movie? WTF am I watching, is this a fetish film to watch or is it porn at the ending in this Movie, why they make money for this comedy film, don't make a sequel for this, I will give this movie 8/10, why 8/10? because I find it more food-ish and confusing."
" Unfunny Dribble Disguised as An Attempt At Philosophical Adult Humor
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,3,"Am I offended at the jokes in the movie? No, I often make equally horrible, if not, admittedly, worse jokes. Am I offended by the jabs at religion in this movie hidden in its horribly hidden attempts, or lack thereof, to create a thought-provoking story? No, I'm not particularly religious, and if I were, I would've appreciated a movie that was thought-provoking and made me question what I believe. What offends me is how the movie's premise promised a juxtaposition of thought-provoking commentary and funny adult humor, but I came to find that it completely and utterly fails in both regards.Sausage Party tried so hard to be funny, with food puns relating to sex peppered throughout that would have been worth a chuckle if they were presented in literally any other manner. The execution was horrid, especially when you consider that the movie promised a fusion of raunchy comedy and profound commentary, but instead provided potentially somewhat-funny jokes ruined by being told akin to an 8 year old who forgot how the punchline was worded.The supposed attempts at thought-provoking religious commentary reared its head maybe once or twice during 2 minutes total of watchable segments of this atrocity, but were pushed to the back- burner as means to make way for sex jokes and racial stereotypes for particular ethnic food that are not funny in the slightest because, disregarding how these stereotypes have been played to death in adult comedies, there's hardly any joke behind any of it besides ""Haha, look, the taco is Mexican. Funny, yeah?""Absolutely not worth a watch. You'd be better off looking anywhere else for through provoking commentary and/or adult humor."
" Had something going on but not anything special
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,4,"I am being generous with this rating I think. I am not an extreme hater or an avid fan. I would place myself in the middle of the spectrum. The movie has a really really interesting concept. I really liked the fact that food in the supermarket is kind of a metaphor for the human race (amazing work with the food by the way - amazing artwork there). I like the fact that religion is also part of the discussion etc. There were more than one times during the first half hour of the movie that I was actually impressed by the metaphors and the plot. After the first half hour though, the movie became a repetition of the same thing, totally predictable, with some glimpses of laughter and went down the hill overall. The ending was also as pointless as it could be. I think that this was one of these movies that kind of aims to go into depth with things and till a certain point it does, but in the end it goes too deep for anyone's taste. I would watch it again cause it seems like a movie I wouldn't want to miss, but the feeling in the end is that the movie promised more than it could deliver, or to be on the same context as the movie, it bit more than it could chew!"
" Quite funny in places! 6/10
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,6,"Review: What a crazy film! I really didn't expect this movie to have such foul language and sexual content, especially as it is an animation film. The concept was definitely original, and I doubt that the top studios, like Pixar, would ever make anything in this league but I can't see this film getting a wide audience, like some other animated movies would. Anyway, the movie is based on a hot dog type Sausage called Frank and a hot dog bun called Brenda, who are dying to go into the outside world, so they can get it on. Whilst on the supermarket shelves, the whole store believes that humans are gods, mainly because they take them into the outside to be free but a honey mustard jar returns to the shelves, after being mistakenly bought, and he tries to tell everyone about his bad experience in the outside world, which no one believes. During Honey Mustards outburst, the packet of Hot Dog buns and Hot Dogs, with Frank and Brenda in, are taken off the shelves by a consumer, and while Frank is trying to save Honey Mustard from committing suicide, the basket tips over, causing the contents to fall out of the basket. One of the baskets items, Douche, damages his nozzle, which falsies the manager to throw him in the bin, so he makes it his mission to destroy Frank and Brenda, who caused the basket to tip over. Whilst separated from there packets, Frank and Brenda join forces with Kareem Abdul Lavash and Sammy Bagel Jr. to make there way back to there department in the store but Frank wants to find out more about the outside world from Firewater, whose in the stores liquor aisle, so they take a quick detour and they wait for Frank to get his information. While Frank is smoking weed with Firewater, the rest of his crew are on the run from Douche, who has used his wicked ways to hunt them down but with the help of Teresa, a small taco, they manage to escape from Douche, and finally catch up with Frank, who tries to convince them that the outside world is pretty awful. Nobody wants to believe Frank about the so-called gods, so he uses the information that he got from Firewater, to get some proof and then he goes back to the market to show everyone what happens when they are taken off the shelves. Crazy but true! The movie then goes down an avenue of drugs, violence and an outrageous orgy, which is quite shocking if your not used to Seth Rogen's type of comedy. I did find the movie quite funny and the crazy plot was well put together but I did think that some of the scenes went a bit too far. It will change the way that you buy and cook food in the future, in a funny way but it's definitely not for kids, and some adults who will be offended by some of the jokes. If you don't take the movie seriously, you will find it fun, and it's one of those films that you can watch, to put you in a good mood but I doubt that it will go down as an all time classic. Enjoyable!Round-Up: With such a huge amount of actors supplying there voices to this risky comedy, I'm not surprised that the various characters brought different styles of comedy to the big screen, which made the movie work. It's directed by Greg Tiernan, who has directed Thomas and Friends cartoons since 2009, and he was the animation director for Happily N'Ever After. The other director, Conrad Vernon, 48, directed Shrek 2, Monsters vs. Aliens and Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted, so he was the perfect choice to bring Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg and Jonah Hills story to the big screen. The animation was quite impressive, for a movie about food, and the expressions on the various characters faces, were spot on but the orgy scene really took it to another level. I personally can't a sequel in the near future, unless they name it Burger Party, so for a stand alone film, I would say that it was a decent achievement, which made a healthy profit.Budget: $19million Worldwide Gross: $140.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/adventure/comedies, voiced by Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Craig Robinson, Edward Norton, Danny McBride, Salma Hayek, Bill Hader, James Franco, Michael Cera, Nick Kroll, David Krumholtz and Anders Holm. 6/10"
" Is a piece of stool
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,1,"First, i respect others way of thinking but the movie deals with some sort of a vague analogy from the social interaction of the many cultures that make our world, regarding the main issue i for one have read this on books but don't have the reference at this moment, but some how the center idea goes out something like in reality we do not perceive beings that are in higher or lower levels of existence, therefore we are oblivious that the higher beings form a chain of predator nature, feeding on the weaker more simpler beings, this has a strong relation to the esoteric philosophy of the early postmodernism of the 70's, that there are cosmic gators, or lions or other animals depicted by ancient cultures that some way are blah blah blah gods... this is just as a watermelon milkshake, but it speaks of the collective interest of that peculiar group of artist that make movies, and get hooked by them and sough out to express their thoughts, the way they do it is most representative of them self's, by taking that crap in to the movie theater... but to me, i have to say that they need to smoke less herbs, read more, and grow an opinion of their own, and by that you have to consume your life to endless lectures about the development of philosophy and logic, what can i share in simple words is that in some point it begins to add up, and only then you star to realize where is God, and Who he is, unfortunately the are too busy having amazing prosperous lives to care about reading Imanuel Kant, Hegel, Heidegger, Levinas, Habermass, and many many more, that add bits and pieces to a far far greater than life story, that corresponds to math and physics and all that, but the main point is that the don't read as much as the should, otherwise the movie here should be less stupid, and the resources taken by this production better spent."
" The best R Rated comedy since Ted
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,"Sausage Party is arguably in my opinion the best R Rated comedy film since Ted. In fact I actually think this film is more of a Seth MacFarlane movie as this movie has all the kind of things you would find in Ted, American Dad and Family Guy such as violent slapstick, adult humour, crude stuff and drugs. At first glance the film looks like a typical Disney/Universal animated movie for kids but once Frank says 'Shit!' it turns out to be an adult movie.In the movie Frank a frankfurter, his girlfriend a bun roll named Brenda and the other foods hope to be chosen by customers to go to the 'Great Beyond' not knowing in reality they are in danger and are meant to be eaten alive by humans. Once the truth is found out Frank and his friends decide to protect themselves as well as get revenge on the humans. However a rejected douche named Douche wants revenge on Frank after he accidentally prevented him being used by a female customer for her vagina.The film wasn't the funniest comedy but if you love Ted and Family Guy you will probably love this movie. Only wish Seth MacFarlane was director."
" I Ain't A Prude But....
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,5,"I watched Sausage Party last night from Redbox for a dollar, it was buy one movie, get the second one for half off so that's how I got to watch this film at a discount price which is the best way to view it.Anyway I gave this film a 5 out of 10 mainly because I ""liked"" the idea of the film. We've grown up on Toys coming to like aka Toy Story, Fish coming to life to save their son aka Finding Nemo or even a car coming to life to save his best friend aka Cars 2 but this film is NOT for kids let's just get that out of the open right now. Of course it's not it's about food that have sex, do drugs, make fart, dick and vag jokes the whole film. Oh yeah you read that right a sausage making a dick joke, okay I get it but do we need a 90 minute about a sausage trying to get inside his friend who just happens to be a bun. Okay theirs a sentence I didn't think I'd ever write in my lifetime.Now I ain't a prude but what was this film? Food coming to life to take on the humans so they don't get eaten. Okay I get that but food was here to be eaten to live. Oh and don't think you can get by being a vegetation in this film, oh no, even the veggies and fruit come to life to take on the humans from being eaten. Oh that's not all, you think you'll get by on a bag of chips or a cup of soda to fend off hunger, nope those come to life as well. So basically humans would starve unless they eat each other or animals like cats or dogs but let's not go there that's another tale for another time. Oh and by the way you'll go thirsty as well if you wanted to take a drink from your water-bottle because guess what that's alive as well! I can understand the food coming to life to take down the human race BUT water how is water alive I ask you? Don't get me started on some of the scenes in this film. Ugh I can't even talk about it which giving anything away but trust me it's NOT a kids film. Let's just say a sausage gets it in the back and up the middle, okay that for anyway you want. But if you've seen the film then you know what I mean. That scene made my 12 year old nephew who watched it with me say ""Okay no, that's a bit much."" Now if you can make a 12 year old say that then yeah the film is not good. Oh and don't get up on me for watching a movie like this with a 12 year old, okay he's 12 so don't get up in my Kool-Aid for letting him watch it.Should you watch this film? Well if you can get it at a discount for half off at Redbox like I did, then yes I say go for it. I would say wait for TV to play it, but yeah right like TV would play this film and if they did it would be edited like crazy so why bother. So if you don't want to spend money you could wait for HBO or Cinemax to play it."
" Love it or hate it
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,7,"Sausage Party has two immediate different reactions on people. Some people really love it and have a great time watching, me for example, and some other people are disgusted by it. No nah, no bah, no meh reactions here.The movie has all you need to offend people: sexual references, swearing, xenophobic remarks, religious negative clichés, blasphemy, explicit straight and gay sex scenes, drug and alcohol abuse, that and more. Like a compilation of subconscious repressed thoughts unleashed into the wild. Food porn gets onto a new meaning here, or perhaps not.The idea is ingenious, albeit irreverent, the animation is fun and perfect for the story, the dialogues are witty (plenty of puns!) and some of the scenes and dialogues are hilarious.This came out of the mind of some 'sick' people, for sure, thank you guys! It is very funny, gross funny. Not for children, not for sensitive watchers, not for people who don't like gross humour a priori.A truly enjoyable film if you are the target of the movie.

" This deserves a higher rating than it has
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,"It's crude yes, but there aren't many movies that made me laugh out loud as much as this one. If you are a fan of Rogan's other stuff, you will love this.No one is left out in the comedy, every nation and stereotype has it's relevant product to represent them. If you are easily offended, then maybe this isn't the movie for you. I thought this movie was great, and I was surprised it currently only has rating of 6.4 which I believe is too low. So if you watch it and liked it, please give it a quick rating on IMDb to help bump it up where it belongs!"
