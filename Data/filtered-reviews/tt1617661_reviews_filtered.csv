" Nothing works
",2021-03-30 00:00:00,4,"The self-discovery journey has a passive and bland protagonist, the space politics plot is interesting but confusing, and the shallow romantic arc feels purely obligatory. Nothing works, and the serious tone, poor dialogue (""I love dogs""), and mediocre turns and VFX don't help. With the ending repeat of Jupiter's life on earth I almost forgave it all as a weird character growth metaphor, but then wolf-man boyfriend comes zooming in again on his sky skates and he's grown wings now and.. yeah."
" Wait a second while I pull this stick out!
",2021-03-25 00:00:00,10,"Much better...ok is this movie really a ten, maybe not but it will help balance out the others who forgot to pull their sticks out! I'm not a kunis fan at all so I went into this with a negative attitude, however I was pleasantly surprised. The cast was well chosen, acting was good, great fx and a decent plot(good sci-fi/fantasy). Now don't forget to pull that stick out before watching this underrated gem."
" Not worth your time
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,1,"This is one of the worst movies ever seen. Plot is rubish, bad acting (especially of Mila), effects are unreal, and the directing is terrible.
The storyline goes all over the place. And there is no angle or catch in it. The end is predictable (semi-bad guy dies and the good people live en fall in love). The cast has so much more potential and talents. Even the story-line has. I can not figure out why the director hasn't chose wisely and lets you catch the plot and take you with it. Such a waste of time, energy, talent and resources. Sorry for all the sf and fantasy fans. There is only one place for this movie and thats the bin"
" I've never been so confused
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,1,I have absolutely no idea what is going on in this movie.
" HOW is this rated so low?! I loved it!
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,9,"I am baffled by the low score on this movie! I don't think I've been so in love with Channing Tatum. The movie actually had action scenes that lasted more than 10 seconds. I swear that I was at the end edge of my seat for almost the whole thing. Mila's and Channing's characters feels so genuine. Maybe that why people think it's bad acting??? It's not bad acting, it's a more real version of how relationships start. It's not fluffy, perfect, or always romantic. It's awkward and scary. I can't be the only one that can see this? I've never seen a more moving and raw movie. I'm so overwhelmed. How have I never heard of this movie until now??? Feels like the Riddick movies which I'm also such a fan of! Honestly so good."
" Absolutely fantastic movie
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,10,"The only criticism I can make of it is that Her Majesty is always saved at the last minute in the same way. It does have an explanation and is acceptable but by the third time you knew what was going to happen. As for the rest of the movie it is very well written and well acted. I came away from the first viewing of the movie knowing I saw something very unique and entertaining. As time went by I was left with the desire to watch it again. I am glad I did. You see and understand so much more. It is a great action packed movie that has good character development and will leave you amazed at what they were able to do in the movie. Little did I know that somewhere on this Earth there is a housekeeper that owns this world. Maybe, I can ask her for a loan."
" This movie has like EVERYTHING you would want
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,7,"No seriously, this movie has, like, EVERYTHING. A lot of it seems to be taken from other movies (or fanfiction or something) and it can definitely be too much at times, but honestly I loved this so much! The story was really imaginative and it's beautiful. Sometimes the writing is silly but I like how dramatic and creative it can be too. Also the protagonist is a woman and not a stereotype, and then there's this dog dude who is actually pretty hot. (This totally reminds me of a fanfiction but in a good way)
Anyway, this movie is a lot of fun and a step in the right direction. I love classic sci-fi, especially when it's more feminist like in this movie. I also like how it's a mix of sci-fi and fantasy and normal life- so yeah, I loved this movie! Maybe it's not the right movie for everyone but I wish more people would give it a chance. It had everything I would want, anyway."
" Cinderella meets Matrix
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,4,"So this is a movie about some bimbo who all of the sudden learns she is really a queen of some kind of kingdom and that the world is not what we think it is.
2 hours of so much stuff happening that at the end you just don't care"
" Terrible
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,2,Trying to cram way too much into 2 hours and it ends up one giant mess.
" GRAB A BOWL OF POPCORN - GRADE B
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,8,"Not really sure about all of the hate towards this movie, but I found it entertaining, to the point of wanting to see a sequel.One thing I see in the reviews is complaining about one-dimensional characters. Not really sure what they were watching. The primary characters do have depth and learn.The script, well I found it well done hence why I would like to see a sequel.Enjoy!"
" Best watched Cold Turkey.
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,6,"I knew absolutely nothing about this movie when I started it.I will emphasize that this is, in a very real way, intentional. I didn't know the directors, the actors, the general story, etc. I have come to hate watching trailers for new movies.I just found out that this movie is a flop, and I can actually say that this surprises me. Especially when you hear the negative reviews. I am usually first in line complaining about flashy videos and cheesy dialogue. I also hate long movies.I would actually describe it as something akin to Dune in space. A bit heavy on the dialogue and intrigue. But I would definitely not describe the acting as super flat. The villains are timeless immortals, and their performance never once distracted me.The Bee thing was weird.
As was a HUGE chunk of the 'science' involving anything and genetics.This is not science fiction. This is a political thriller set in space. Kinda reminded me of Dune for some reason.Quite enjoyable.Edit: Nope, just posted it and then I remembered the ending. I did not like the ending."
" Bad movie
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,4,"I watched this as i love most of the other Wachoski's movies (Matrix, V For vendetta and Sense 8) . But this was a waste of time and i will not get back these 2 hours. If you are just looking for mindless escapism then this will barely crack it. Stupid cliche roles of the damsel in distress and hero wolf man. This was just no worth it and wash a block buster cash grab aimed at 14 year boys dragging along the girlfriends.Don't watch it, rather re-watch V for vendetta"
" Fantasy tale, good for kids
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,6,"In fact, I liked this movie. However, this is a fantasy tale, not for adults or Sci-Fi fans. The story is relatively original and fun to watch. Just that."
" Downhill ride
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,2,"Starts interesting enough so you watch more. In the middle it becomes a soap opera. Boring. Also there is an extreme difference between the audio of the people talking, is low. And the crash, shooting, is too loud. So is uncomfortable. The movie is strangely dark, in in the subject but in lightning. And the last observation, why is Eddie Redmayne whispering???"
" Way Better than what I Expected
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,9,"I avoided this film for years! Mostly because I listened to all the negative reviews.When I finally watched it, I was delighted to see a movie that paid homage to old school science fiction while simultaneously elevating the genre as its known by modern standards.Jupiter is an amazing character. Not because she's some badass fighter or super genius. She not. She may the most ordinary character ever on the outside. But inside, what makes her different than most heroes, is her ability to empathize. That's right, the main character's only weapon in this film is empathy!I'm not surprised that such a masterpiece wasn't/isn't appreciated in its own time. Thank you for this amazing film Lily and Lana!"
" Still beautiful, if limited
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,8,"Seems to me the Wachowskis needed the kind of investment for another matrix series but the storylines were just too similar. Character development is so fast and unseen it breaks the illusion which is meant to carry the viewer into the believing the impossible. But then if you've watched the archetypal stories you ultimately know how they go. Still, beautifully made if only a little rushed."
" Just Noise
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,3,"Just a lot of noise, no real story, most of the characters suck. Villains are laughable at best.Special effects are good and imaginative. Tatum's eyeliner is stupid... his wings at the end are silly to say the least.Really the best weapon to defeat these space legions of doom are just a pair of flying boots.Once again Hollywood has become the ""masters of trailers"" yet continue to pour out these weak movies that are not only forgettable but ideal to put any insomniac to sleep.I have put off from watching this movie for years... now I wish I would have put it off forever"
" Don't keep high expectations
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,6,"Yes, don't keep high expectations just because you loved Matrix series and liked Cloud Atlas. Wachowskis don't seem to find that connectedness with viewers this time. The direction is super, no doubt on those technical special effects but what the movie lacks is the solid foundation of storyline. In recreating entirely new universe, the movie fails to engage the viewer with altogether new world. The concept is ok but the development of idea is poor. Acting is very average and I even didn't liked Eddie Redmayne fumbles here."
" Huge potential
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,6,"Could have been great but fails in the end and becomes just a teen love story. Dont get me wrong there is a place for these kind of movies, but the movie could have been a classic . With a clear vision and a More focused storyline , the story had one great hook that was very interesting but was lost..."
" Receives way too much hate - a glorious piece of sci-fi eye candy.
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,9,"I don't understand what everyone has against this movie. It's really not as bad as everyone says it is. In fact, it's one of my favourite films, and I just don't get the bad reviews.This is my first IMDb review so I think I should start with a movie I have heard some very controversial opinions on, and buckle up, because I have a lot to say.Let me just say I loved this movie. I think that this is an amazing attempt at creating an original story that's not an adaptation or a sequel, and I think that the storyline is rich and interesting. The effects are simply stunning, and it has to be one of the most visually rich films I've seen (think: cathedral spaceships and evil space-palaces). It's just so loaded with elaborately planned content and history - I have seen this film nine times and every time I watch it again I find yet more things which I didn't notice before. I enjoyed the plot, I don't think I've seen anything similar to this movie. I mean, whenever people ask me to sum it up, I can never quite do so. The action sequences are beautifully choreographed in the style of the Wachowskis. The whole thing was just a surreal, beautiful, elaborate, weird space opera adventure. It's honestly so over-the-top and crazy that I don't think you were ever meant to take it seriously - I mean, I've got to admit I have burst out laughing watching this even when the dialogue wasn't supposed to be inherently funny (for example, when the actors try to explain completely nonsensical stuff like flying boots or gene splicing with a perfectly straight face, or the fact that all of the protagonists are American whilst all three antagonists are just so British). But that's the thing I love the most about this film.I am dying, and I mean dying, for this to get a sequel. I mean, I know that will never happen due to the box-office failure of this, but the storyline has so, so much potential - not all of the loose ends were tied up and there's so much world building that could happen just because of how rich the Jupiter Ascending universe is.I mean, you can definitely see the years of sci-fi classics that have left their imprint Jupiter Ascending. The plot reminded me an uncanny amount of Dune (there's a life-prolonging substance which is very hard to obtain, and person born into royalty has to save the world from their over-the-top royal relatives) with a bit of the Matrix (people are harvested as sustenance for higher life-forms). When I finished reading and watching Dune, my first immediate thought was ""This is literally the same thing as Jupiter Ascending"". But despite these similarities, Jupiter Ascending manages to keep its originality and unique taste without being seen as a rip-off.'Jupiter Ascending' has got to be the most hated-on film that I know. And that really makes me annoyed because I love this film and, whilst I respect peoples' opinions, I genuinely don't understand all the criticisms. To name a few, people are constantly talking about the 'overly complex plot line' and the 'underdeveloped characters'. Okay, fine, the plot is a bit hard to follow at times and it does jump around a little, but I love the fact that this is a very thought-out plot. There's a very cohesive history behind the film. In addition, it's a great metaphor for capitalism and the fight for resources. The music is incredible and so, so perfect for suspense, as well as giving the film such unique and recognisable themes (I still have the music from the trailer stuck in my head!).I disagree with the repeated claims that the characters are underdeveloped. First of all, this film has about five or six main characters, and it is HARD to give each a perfectly realised backstory, motivations, a personality etc. in the space of two hours. If you want incredibly deep characters, please go watch a soap opera or a romance movie or something. Here, in that space of two hours, you get a very interesting look at the characters. Each has their own motivation and ideas. I mean, you have Jupiter and Caine's relationship, the Abrasax rivalry, and Jupiter's bond with her slightly chaotic Earth family. Jupiter Ascending has a very interesting and varied cast with a lot of famous names in it (as well as some people who I have never heard of but definitely seem worth checking out, like Tuppence Middleton who I would definitely like to see more of). Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum perform well as the leads of the story and they have interesting chemistry on screen, but I think that the strongest performance came from Eddie Redmayne as the primary antagonist. Remember how I said that this film is over-the-top? Well, I'm just going to say that his performance *redefines* 'over-the-top'.
The only issues I have is that the pacing is not perfect, with some of the action sequences being a little too long and there being some stretches where nothing really happens, and the storyline can be a bit hard to follow as I have already mentioned. I should enforce that this is a very minor setback and doesn't affect my love of this film, and all confusion goes away with a rewatch or a quick read of the Wikipedia page or a second watch. I must say that this movie is not for everyone, as it is more of the fantasy side of science fiction as oppose to something like the Matrix which is more of a thriller/ traditional action sci-fi. Because of this, can I please just mention that people have got to stop comparing this to the Matrix? It's not the Matrix. That came out 20 years ago. This is a completely different style of film, and it is completely illogical to compare the two.Jupiter Ascending will remain one of my favourite movies, and I firmly believe it is a must-watch for any science fiction fan. Do not listen to all of the tHiS iS tHe WoRsT mOvIe EvEr reviews. They don't know what they're talking about. We need more films like Jupiter Ascending.-Sasha"
" My head hurts
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,4,"What even happened? I swear I payed attention...I highly recommend this movie if you like to have a headache.
Not because it is complex, but because nothing makes sense.The worlds they introduce have more in common with Harry Potter than SciFi.
Even the music reminds me of it.
There were 4 first acts, 3 second acts and 2(?) three acts? The prolong is ridiculous and the epilogue is... extremely lame.I feel like this movie would be a really cool trilogy. But sadly is is one giant incomprehensible product."
" Opens your mind
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,10,Very eye opening And reminds us of the possibilities that our universe could be hiding from us humans alive and fresh. Maybe some bad acting. But the story and message the story gives is a humbling one. Also it seems they try and mLe you feel like even though you may feel like your going no where in life you could be in a worse more demanding position. Sometimes the idea of just being one of the sheep has its benefits.
" Couldn't make it through an hour
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,1,And that was fifty minutes too long. It's almost like a spoof of the worst of its genre. Avoid this movie; you will be stupider for having watched it if you don't.
" 2015 hidden gem
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,10,"Just saw this after 5 years since its release, and WOW howd id missed this? The action, the production, visual effects are outstanding. The Wachowski's have done it again, its just amazing! And the story could be the next Game of Thrones"
" Good for some laughs at its incompetence, and that's about it
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,4,"I don't know what the problem is with the Wachowskis. Perhaps they are the type of directors who only have one really good idea, and they've been coasting on the popularity acquired from The Matrix for years, as they stumble through trying to recapture the magic. Then again, they could be the type of directors who simply can't create a good product after they had great success, because now no one is willing to tell them ""No."" There's even a chance that their one big success was a fluke, and they really should be cinematographers or visual effects artists, and leave the writing/directing to someone else. Whatever the problem may be, Jupiter Ascending is another convoluted pile of ideas that don't congeal into a quality film. I wanted to give this movie the benefit of the doubt, and it does look good. There is a sumptuous quality to the visuals in this film, and even though the staging and script feel like a Star Wars prequel, the scenes still have a look like they were shot on real sets with a more sensible amount of visual effects. Sadly, that's about all the movie has going for it.I think the most frustrating thing about Jupiter Ascending is the protagonist played by Mila Kunis. She does the best with what she's given, but this is a thankless role. She is presented as the heroine of the movie and yet she only does three things for the entire runtime: 1) She is the exposition receiver. There are countless scenes where she simply stands there while the entire universe is mansplained to her by every other character in the film. 2) She is a human MacGuffin and/or damsel in distress. She gets shuffled around against her will between every other character in the film, and it is tedious. Sometimes she's actively resisting it, other times she willingly goes with the flow because she's also somewhat spineless. And, of course she has to fall down a lot so Channing Tatum can continue to rescue her. 3) She is a fashion model. I don't know the last time I saw a movie where a character changed outfits as often as Kunis does in this one. It's so odd to the point that she seems to have a new outfit for every single set piece.The plot of Jupiter Ascending is beyond ridiculous. I'd like to say it didn't make any sense, but they spent so much of the film trying to explain it that eventually you can put the pieces together. Of course the whole genetic reincarnation thing seemed moronic to me, but I could at least comprehend what they were trying to say. The romance with Channing Tatum was awkward, particularly given how his character is described. I mean, we're basically supposed to root for a relationship based on bestiality. Tatum does his usual tough-guy performance with weird makeup and hair applied. Personally, I think he is more entertaining when he's allowed to be a bit humorous, rather than trying to be a serious enforcer all the time. Eddie Redmayne's performance is almost indescribably bad. However, he is one of the elements that made Jupiter Ascending somewhat enjoyable for me. This might be one of the strongest examples in recent cinema history of a movie that is so-bad-it's-good. I did have some fun laughing at this movie and all its insanity. I think that's what I would recommend, is that people who enjoy the so-bad-it's-good genre gather with their friends and watch Jupiter Ascending for some good laughs, because it will provide plenty of those."
" Visually stunning, phenomenal scifi!! Sequel please!!
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,9,"I have finally have come to the conclusion that I've been fighting for years, Americans have no sense of good and bad!! Shows like tiger king and keeping up with the Kardashians are hits , movies like Forrest gump are incredibly popular but this incredible piece of scifi heaven gets a 5 SERIOUSLY???? Visually stunning it reminds me of a great luc besson film, this is by the same writers and directors of matrix and this is right in that league!! Dont believe the negative people remember millions still think Trump is a good president when in reality he isn't even a good human!!!"
" A Space Opera like any other
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,8,"Not sure why people seem to hate Jupiter Ascending. It's an overindulgent epic space opera with paper-thin characters and way too many overlong action sequences laughing in the face of the laws of physics.But that's just the genre.As such, it's as good as any other in the same genre, and thoroughly entertaining. Mila Kunis does an excellent job as reluctant royalty and it's refreshing to see Eddie Redmayne playing pure evil rather than a brooding or fumbling anti-hero. And it throws in some humor in the mix too.if you expect it to be any other type of movie, you'll be disappointed, but if you enjoy *any* Star Wars movie, The Fifth Element, Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets or any other silly space opera, you should certainly allow yourself to like this one."
" There's cool cgi, that's all
",2020-09-11 00:00:00,3,"If you like well developed character, great pacing and thought provoking narratives. Well this movie isn't for you."
" Meh
",2020-09-11 00:00:00,6,"Story was alright, some of the cg and dialog was pretty cringe though. Channing tatum was very obviously on rollerskates."
" Okayish!
",2020-09-10 00:00:00,6,"What the hell, I mean it was really good, the storyline, the acting and all but teh graphics seemed a bit off and the fact of Jupiter's queen seemed a bit off but aside from that everything was great. I had to turn it off once in a while to take a break from it. Recommendable but I'd say Watch at your own risk."
" Horrible
",2020-09-10 00:00:00,1,Just terrible. Don't waste your time. Wakowski Brothers are on crack for thinking they could make this. Don't even want to waste my time with a review.Garbage.1 star
" Pretty cool effects but story is kind of all over the place.
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,5,Seems like a movie where it would of ended up being 3+hrs if directors had their way. It's got some pretty awesome visuals and decent action scenes but isn't great. Not really worth watching unless nothing better to do.
" A great example of everything wrong with Hollywood
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,1,"Horrible cast, horrible acting, horrible story, horrible characters. I have nothing positive to say about it, it's all just a huge waste of time and money. It is quite remarkable that Hollywood is so happy to waste $200M on Special Effects and terribly overrated actors, but can't be bothered to spend a cent on writing a good script."
" It's a 5
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,5,"Because ... meh.Really disappointing performance by Eddie Redmayne, especially. Certainly not a harbinger of performances to come."
" Not a Cinematic Revolution, but Exciting Nonetheless.
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,9,"Grossly underrated by those looking for life altering experiences. This movie is what cinema was designed to be. Exciting, funny, curious. By far not everyone's cup of tea, but then, if you create a movie that is, perhaps you've sold your movie short of its potential? This movie adaptation reminded me of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in all the best of ways."
" Story is ok ....
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,6,"The start is extremely strong...
Store is ok. I enjoyed it.... my major point is the special effects scenes... they drag on and on....
Cut eachone by 60% and you have a much more powerful movie..."
" Leaves a lot to be desired
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,5,"Visually stunning at times, but the drawn out action sequences seem gratuitous. The plot is ambitious, but lacks the desired depth, as do any of the characters. It has a good storyline and universe, potentially, but it would be better suited as a series rather than a one-off movie. The ending was anticlimactic, too."
" Nice b movie if only it wouldn't be this incoherent..
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,6,"Nice cast and quite okay story. Too bad it is so incoherent to watch. It is as if there is about 60 minutes of deleted scenes missing to make it more easy to watch. However of course that would make it way to long.
Nice idea, poor storytelling and execution."
" Nothing is Fascinating apart from the Title of the movie
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,3,"Jupiter Ascending is a Sci-Fi movie The Wachowskis brother and stars Channing Tatum, Mila Kunis, Sean Bean, Eddie Redmayne and Douglas Booth in the leads.Jupiter Ascending is a simple and predictable movie of a family tale depicting inheritance from family, scheming by the siblings, fighting to get more and more with a happy ending but in a more complicated and tangled manner.The movie has one of the best visuals and is a treat to watch but sadly apart from visuals nothing is impressive and the movie skimps on some uneven screenplay and poor execution and off-course half hearted acting.Acting as mentioned is average with disappointing performance by Kunis and Tatum. The only saving grace was Redmayne who was perfect in his portrayal of a ruthless and evil Balem who unfortunately has limited screen space and should have been given more scenes. The introduction of the characters is also not perfect as some of the characters just vanishes without a trace.Screenplay of the movie is average and uneven and couldn't hold the plot for long. Music is good and climax is predictable and doesn't excites.Overall apart from the name and the theme I didn't find anything appealing or fascinating in the movie. Could be one time watch for SCI-FI lovers."
" Do I have to?
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,4,"There's a quote from the film which runs something like:
""The most precious resource in the universe is not oil, not gold, it's time."" Follow the advice by avoiding the film."
" A great and totally underrated movie with incredible visuals and world-building
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,8,"It's unabashedly a space opera. It's kinda campy, but in an endearing way that feels very consistent with the genre. I loved the little nods to sci-fi classics.The visuals are incredible. Their artistic choices were spot on, start to finish. The movie deserves a high rating on that alone. The aerial battle scene over Chicago is one of my favorite sci-fi battles ever.They did an excellent job creating a universe that I want to know more about. It feels like there is a rich backstory to each character and location. It's a world that seems ripe for further exploration.It's held back by middling dialogue and unexceptional performances from some of the leads. Mila Kunis' Jupiter just felt stiff as a character and Channing Tatum's Caine was clearly intended to come off as stoic, but ended up just being kind of boring. I'm still not entirely sure if I love or hate Eddie Redmane's performance as Balem Abrasax.I want more of this, but as a TV show spinoff, not a sequel with these characters (not that I'll be holding my breath)."
" Worse than Green Lantern
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,1,"This is the worst film I've ever seen. It's horribly bad. If I could give it a minus review I would.
I couldn't finish it.
Woeful."
" Essence of gelfling.
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,4,The focus of the story is all over the place. The first big action is rendered pointless because the aliens that are trying to kill Jupiter fix the city. Apparently even aliens beleve in reincarnation and the bureaucracy in having to re register when they come back. Jupiter reads the intergalactic monopoly rule book and is trying to play the game. Jupiters space family is just as bad as her earth family. Jupiter loves dogs. The stupid end. The music and visual effects are waisted on this story.
" Ridiculous
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,2,I'm not an expert... but this movie seems like a gigantic waste of recourses. The only entertainment value it had for me was laughing at how ridiculous it was.
" Utterley Hilarious
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,3,"A great way to see some great actors debase themselves, presumably for cash, and perhaps some promises from the Directors that they would be in a ""great"" movie.Unintelligible script that is fairly in-keeping with the steadily descending quality of the Warchowskis for anything they did since the Matrix 2.You want to see Mila Kunis look great (as usual) and accept a tolerable amount of male help (by todays' standards)? Check.Want to see a half-dog version of Channing Tatum wear mascara and scoot around on laser skates? Check.Want to see Eddy Redmayne talk in a weird whisper and generally look bored? No? Fair enough.The list of great actors is long, including Sean Bean.Overblown, repetitive and ridiculous plot that isnt well thought-out. Too many effects which repeat the approach taken with the Matrix sequels (ie: more of the same stuff, a lot more, is better).This movie is basically a better-produced Battlefield Earth. Worth the watch while blootered on a few substances. However Im really keen for the upcoming sequel - ""Uranus Exploding."""
" Give it a shot
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,7,"For five years, I've put off watching this movie due to unfavorable reviews. Quarantine had me desperate for new content though so I gave it a shot and was not disappointed.It's not high cinema, and there are certainly elements ""borrowed"" from other franchises... but the cinematography, acting, and storyline were all excellent. The SciFi ""tech"" and style was well thought out and original. It's a fun movie and just about the right length for the genre. If you liked Stargate, Blade Runner, or Dune (heck, even The Last Starfighter) you'll like Jupiter Ascending."
" The Wachowskis' mad space opera
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,5,"Jupiter Ascending was the film that most people thought the Wachowskis lost their minds. It a big space opera that had excellent special effects and action sequences that most people would expect from the siblings, but it pales in comparison to the world-building, storytelling, and themes of most of their previous work. The Wachowskis were trying the repeat some of the ideas from The Matrix, i.e. the main character finding out that their reality is a lie and the human race were being farmed. But the world Jupiter Ascending came across as incoherent ramblings with The Wachowskis try to make their own version of Dune."

" Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,1,This is quite possibly the worst movie ever made and most definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. Close runner up is Mad Max. Just save yourself the waste of time and the straining to hear Eddie Redmayne speak.
" Tosh
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,3,Movie awful. Actors and directors should have known better. I managed to sit through it to the end but only because I was tired on the sofa and couldn't reach the control.
" Wait....what?!?!?
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,1,"How many times have you rewound or restarted this ""movie"" to see what you missed when there is new dialogue only to find out you didn't miss anything and it's just a hot mess that seems like it was edited together like a 3 year old trying to tell you a story about...well....anything? This movie is 2hrs long and I've already watched the first 25min of it enough times to eclipse that before I gave in and read reviews to see what was actually going on. And after reading a few articles in my search results for ""Jupiter Ascending confusing"" it just does not seem worth any payoff it might have. Stupid concept, poor script, confusing timelines. I'm done."
" Expected More from the Wachowskis
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,2,"I avoided investing my time in this 125 minute oeuvre of cinema for five years, but I finally made the decision to sit down and really watch it. I mean, the Wachowskis wrote and directed it, so I wondered why I hadn't read many cultural references, or any at all, regarding Jupiter like there had been for a generation since The Matrix. There was a lot of potential to create a new set of iconic characters, like Neo and Morpheus, ripe with meme material, to satisfy our thirst for something entirely fresh and quotable.
Jupiter was disappointing. The story - writing is the life-blood of any good story - was so thinly constructed it couldn't possibly stand up to the heavy CGI effects. Without a good story, the rest is at best eye candy. Sure, the costumes were nice to look at, and there were very recognizable names in the cast, Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, Sean Bean, and Eddie Redmayne. But even these big stars were incapable of keeping the movie afloat, because the story lacked cohesion and substance. It felt as if the Wachowskis were still writing as filming had begun.
The visual effects, the CGI, were at some times very cool to look at, but mostly exhausting. During a couple of action sequences I lost interest and decided to fold some laundry. The story was so pedestrian to the point that many scenes were utterly predictable, and their outcome didn't seem to make any difference. We seemed to keep coming back to the same place we were 30 minutes earlier.
But I stuck with the movie - there aren't many I have given up on - and viewed it to the end, at least to where the credits started. Netflix must have decided I didn't need to see the end credits, because some other program queued up within seconds. In any case, I sat through the whole thing, with the only benefit being clean, folded linens to show for it.
Well, Mila Kunis was pretty, so there's that."
" Different and worth watching
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,7,"I watched entire movie and fully enjoyed it. I think the negative reviews are made by people that didn't watch the entire movieThe story comes through whilst watching it. You get a good idea of it by about 30m as Jupe (Mila Kunis, hot) finds out. If they had described it correctly it would ruin it.It's camp as in 'Flash Gordon' at some points but this makes it unique. Not many movies have managed that.It's not Star Wars and was never meant to be
I'd recommend this if you actually watch it with open mind.Mila Kunis x, did I say that lolEnjoy an original"
" Great epic science fiction film that delivers the visuals and action.
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,10,Jupiter Ascending (5 out of 5 stars).Jupiter Ascending is one of the best sci fi action films that delivers on a epic story and action. The Wachowskis have a done a marvelous job in delivering another sci fi epic. The cast is great. The story is great with a lot to take in within the first hour. The action sequences are exciting. The visual effects are great. The music score is wonderful.
" Is entertaining, althoguh Mila Kunis is sooooo bad!!!!!
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,4,"This is a movie to spend a saturday afternoon if you do not have anything better to do. Images and effects are amazing, everything else is quite poor. Actors are in general good, Channing Tatum and Sean Penn were good as usual. Mila Kunis is so bad I could not believe it, she is the anticlimax of a sci-fi movie and performed so poorly in this movie that I just don't want to see any of her other movies."
" great visuals, but dull story
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,6,"Jupiter Ascending is a story about a woman named Jupiter (Mila Kunis). Her dad was killed when she was a baby and she lives with her mom and some relatives. Jupiter cleans houses for a living, hates her life, and longs to spend about $4000 on a telescope. She decided to sell her eggs for the money.While in the medical office, turns out the doctors are hired alien killers who are about to kill her but she's saved at the last moment by hunter-space-speedskater Caine Wise (Channing Tatum). Turns out she's royalty because bees like her.She's promptly kidnapped by other aliens, but Caine is able to jump aboard the ship at the last moment. They drop her off in an alien world to meet the first of three siblings, who are heir to a group of planets. Yeah, turns out these aliens are humans, and humans all around the universe -- including earth -- are basically farms. We are turned into goo and these alien humans get to extend their life,Jupiter is captured again, Caine is thrown into space only to be saved at the last moment. Jupiter almost gets married to sibling number 2 only for Caine to stop the wedding at the last moment. I should mention at this point that, somehow, Jupiter is the reincarnation of the mother of the three siblings. Yeah... eww.She goes back home only to find her family has been taken hostage by piggy #3. He wants her to abdicate her rights as the owner of Earth. She refuses and is about to be killed, but is saved by Caine at the last moment. Some action stuff happens and she almost falls to her death, but is saved by Caine at the last moment.Story ends with her cleaning the toilets, but now loving her life, knowing she owns the Earth, or something like that.So, the good: the visuals. The Wachowskis paint a beautiful and creative universe. There's also a Brazil-esque scene about bureaucracy of becoming official royalty, which was cute. Kunis and Tatum have good chemistry between them.The bad: the story is just dull and convoluted. It's a nice concept, but the execution is unnecessarily complicated and they spend too much time setting things up. The space-skating is neat the first couple times, then gets tiresome after. The special effects action sequence is just too over the top, at least for my tastes.It reminds me of Valerian -- good visuals, but little else. At least Jupiter ascending had good chemistry between the two leads and the story was better than Valerian, but in both cases, it just seemed like they built a great universe and squandered what they put together. 6/10"
" ""Does any part of you wanna bite me?""
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,6,"If this is the very first sci-fi movie you've ever seen, you might be impressed with the cosmic splendor of it all, what with the astonishingly futuristic CGI and stunning cinematography. I can't help thinking what ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" might have been like with the technological advances we have today. But setting aside all the dazzling color and blazing action, there's not much of a story here, and what there is feels derivative of any number of galaxy spanning films you might have seen over the course of your lifetime. As for the principals, every time I see Mila Kunis I can't help thinking that she was a winner in an Angelina Jolie look-alike contest. After seeing Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything"", I can't really relate to him as the First Primary of the Royal Abrasax family. And that's another thing, the Wachowski's keep you totally off balance with the name 'Abrasax', which feels like a mis-spelling of the Greek word 'Abraxas', but in actuality it's just the reverse, which totally managed to surprise me when I looked it up. I can't find a whole lot to recommend the picture other than it's dynamic, come right at you action sequences, but even then, some of them are stretched way too long, like when the Whitley Streiber-looking aliens called 'Keepers' engaged in an interminable chase scene with partial wolf-man Caine Wise (Channing Tatum). That's another thing, Tatum's character was a lycantant, but in the end analysis, that had nothing really to do with his character or motivation. Don't ask me, I can't explain it."
" Give it 20 years, it'll get the respect it deserves.
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,8,"Jupiter Ascending does not deserve the flack it has been subject to. This movie is a love letter to crazy Moebius inspired sci-fi pulp the likes of which have only been seen in The Incal or extremely scaled down in films like The Fifth Element. There are so many crazy out there ideas and sequences that movie is a whirlwind rush that demands to be experienced. While one could argue that the performances do lean a bit more on the hammier side of the acting spectrum, given the tone and setting of the movie they actually feel quite at home in all the crazy adventures that we're taken through. If you're looking for a movie that's a profound meditation on the human condition and our place in the universe, look elsewhere you'll find none of that nonsense here. But if you are looking for a fun escapist science fantasy that feels like best parts of The Incal and Valerian and Laureline merged with Soylent Green and Dune, this is for you."
" Lovely looking film
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,8,"Unique story, guessing a lot of people don't understand the storyline about planet ownership. Apart from some cheesy lines, it's a good film."
" Definitely worth more than 5.4 stars?
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,8,"Recently watched this film again after all these years and I have to say it was a really enjoyable sci-fi movie it delivers a story great lead characters, and is action packed with above good CGI, better then John Carter by a long shot, it is worth a watch for any sci-fi fan, totally underrated this movie really is."
" Had potential to be a star wars type epic
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,6,Unfortunately potential is the key word here the whole thing is a beautiful visual mess
" A must for the apiarists amongst us...
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,5,"Where to start? This is a mess - a very good looking, visual effects designer's wet-dream of a film; but the plot is a shambles and the sight of Channing Tatum doing his best ""Mr. Tumnus"" impression coupled with Eddie Redmayne as a sort of ""Ming the Manicured"" villain makes this very much a case of style over substance. A girl, Mila Kunis, has been born on Earth - the heir to an intergalactic kingdom and so the Abrasax (Redmayne and Douglas Booth) brothers who currently rule the galaxy determine that they must marry her. Meantime, she has fallen for the pixie-esque Tatum who is out - along with an incredibly stolid Sean Bean - to save her from her manipulated fate... None of that really matters, it's high-camp melodrama with the two brothers about a menacing as finely coutured goldfish; the action scenes - with all sorts of space critters go on for ever and the whole 2 hours is really classily manufactured cinema - but really disappointing,"
" So bad, repeat: so bad!
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,2,"Mila looks ashamed of appearing here. That sums it up.
Tatum's character looked like Spock's (Star Trek) forgotten cousin. Really, makeup team, that's the best you could come up with?
The story is boring, awful and you lose interest in the first 20 minutes; F/X seemed unconvincing or cheesy in some areas. I kept thinking how come you're shooting up a city, buildings, cars- yet you don't see a single soul either taking pictures, looking scared, running etc.
Things like that kept bugging me in many scenes.
If you're expecting a sci-fi like Matrix or something like that, look elsewhere.
What a waste of 2 hours."

" What a ride!
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,10,"Rotten Tomatoes are just that: pretty bloody rotten. Their critics are more concerned about turning out quips and smarty pants phrases than the substance of what they're supposed to be reviewing. Hell, Hamlet is the messiest longest most rambling plot of all. But that doesn't mean the Bard is all of a sudden going to be given 3/10 stars. Critics love to dig into what they hate without respect for the effort involved. And some movies are bad enough to be panned, because their bad faith is so loud and clear. Jupiter Ascending, like Lynch's maligned version of Dune, and Fincher's denigrated Alien 3, packs more cinematic punch in each scene than the whole of the childish and literal minded Star Wars opus. Some viewers look for linear narrative structures and literal plots, forgetting that film, as a predominantly audiovisual medium tells stories through images and sounds. Jupiter Ascending creates a fabulous universe visually. It is far more inventive and imaginative in this regard than many ""classics"" of the genre. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen the whole time, for dear of missing some glorious imahe. Thank God we have streaming services these days, so we can go back and be stunned repeatedly with the images. The narrative premise of earthlings being farmed for the ""elixir of youth"" the aliens prize is no less valid and convincing than the Atreides/Harkonnen rivalry over the Arrakis spice in Dune or the Xenomorph/Engineers as the seeders of earth life in the Alien/Prometheus saga. We, humans, farm many species for resources we consider valuable; why would the planet wide farming premise of the movie be any more weird? It's just a matter of scale, not principle. The script is funny and tongue in cheek, and the two protagonists as well as the motley crew of villains are more than adequately sketched, Tatum, Kunis, Redmayne etc obviously having a ball playing them. Kunis has come a long way from the small screen, she's as good here as she was in Black Swan. The editing provides a crackling pace, even when the plot meanders into secondary story lines. It's an epic, FHS, have you everseen an epic from the Iliad to GOT without secondary storylines? Not even going to touch on the gender of the directors, critics who resort to such irrelevant approaches to crit show their true colours clearly enough. We never say ""male directors"" why should we say ""female directors""? Does that somehow change the critical parameters for a work of art, any work of art? We, in the progressive, civilised West, have a long way to go here. 10 stars for a rollicking, crackling, fast-paced, fun, visually stunning sci-fi flick. Which, on top of all this parodies human values and foibles, like Star Trek's Vulcan greeting, ""live long and prosper"", that most human aspiration of all.
Bravo to all involved."
" Better than the reviews say
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,7,"This is actually an entertaining movie.. the bad reviews are unnecessary. fun fact to watch out for, any time Caine wise shoots hes guns, it makes a ""woof woof"" sound cus hes a lycan..."
" Lost in its own potential
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,5,"There were parts of this movie I really liked and it had potential to be a lot better than what it became. But in the end it seemed to be lost in its own wonder and forgot about story and character development.
The basic story is interesting enough but wasn't to me properly fleshed out and the characters don't really have a lot development. Eddie Redmayne could have been an interesting character but was just boring, hard to hear and poorly played. Without an interesting baddie it lacked focus and depth. Kunis was ok but just same character she has played elsewhere and Sean Bean is good and underutilized but Channing Tatum is just muscle in fancy shoes and shield.
It also one of those films that fell in love with its own CGI and costume design to the detriment of the rest.
Yet despite these flaws it wasn't half as bad as some critics make out and in Covid-19 lock down a passable couple of hours."
" You lie, Rotten Tomatoes! You lie!
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"Once again, Rotten Tomatoes lies. 25% is way lower than it deserves. While it is a bit slow in some parts, it's got enough action to make up for it. The plot is original-ish, and the CGI was amazing. I really liked Eddie Redmayne's acting as the villian. He reminded me a lot of Loki. The whole time I thought of Channing Tatum and Eddie Redmayne as Thor and Loki, because it just worked so well. I don't understand all the hate. Critics these days just give negative reviews to almost everything. If you hate movies, why waste your time being a movie critic? This is one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen. I was absolutely blown away. Everything from the acting, to the visual effects, to the score was perfect. It's not only one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen, but one of the best movies of 2015. (So far, This is still early 2015, so that may change) Eddie Redmayne did not deserve the Oscar for ""The Theory of Everything"", but I wouldn't mind seeing him get at least a nomination for this movie.
Grade: A 9/10 4.5/5 stars"
" Underrated entertaining (sci-)fi movie
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,7,"I do not think the current rating does the movie justice. It is quite entertaining, nicely shot, and with a gripping story. It is not a master piece, but definitely worth watching."
" Beautiful but chaotic and overwrought
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,5,"The special effects? First class. The acting? Pretty good though the most antagonistic antagonist is overacted, which obviously was the director's fault and not the actor's.The potential of this whole thing was truly epic. But it was way too rushed and really lacked refinement. You can't fit it all in two hours. It was obvious the Wachowski brothers had way more in mind than could ever make it to screen. The mistake was trying anyway.It's like they were told they had no chance at a franchise or even a sequel, so in desperation tried to touch on everything they'd ever conceived in this universe of theirs instead of picking the most important aspects and doing them real justice.The result is a movie so haphazard, rushed, and confusing that it is impossible to form a true affinity for any character in it, except perhaps the Earth itself. We all know and love the earth and don't want it destroyed. That's about the only concern I could muster. There are so many disparate plot points and bits of exposition that there is no time to connect any of them.Oh and the balance of power is all out of whack. There seem to be like 10 good guys to every 100000 bad guys. And action scenes that show these good guys prevailing over and over and over against impossible odds. You can not suspend disbelief, it is just too unbelievable even for sci-fi. The sort of good guys with a whole ship can't accomplish things that the gravity skating love interest good guy can do with his eyes closed. Just inconsistent.If you collect all the plot points, mull them over, mull them over some more, watch the movie a second time, you start to see that there was incredible potential: Backstories, power struggles, technology exploration, multiple races, class warfare, galactic scale economies and societies, family struggles, exploration of society's weaknesses and strength, etc.A focused, solid story core with hints of all these other possibilities would have been so much better than trying to include them all in the plot. But the true irony is that the basic plot is oversimplified (every act is the same - run, chase, kidnap, impossible rescue) rinse repeat. Pump up the core plot, lighten up the need to touch on every aspect of the rich universe and family struggles, and this could have been the start of a unique new sci-fi franchise. In the end, I cannot recommend as a compelling show, Especially if you forget about a show the moment you walk out of it, but I can say watch it if you have an imagination and would appreciate pondering on the ideas of what could have been."
" Total waste of talents
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,5,"How such a good cast - including the Oscar winner Eddie Redmaine - could embark on such a B film like that is beyond myself. The plot is unimaginative, the supporting characters very charicaturesque, ranging from a giant talking lizard to an anime doll bounty hunter. A splash of videogame special effects here and there, and that's pretty much it. A ridiculous sci-fi movie that wastes good actors, insults the genre's fans and probably cost millions that could be of better use."
" Beautiful planets
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,3,"This movie has beautiful aesthetics, some good dialogues, a very interesting approach to technology and a very appealing plot.I give this movie 8 because I think that some characters arcs are underdeveloped and because I couldn't actually see the chemistry between the main leads."
" A funny kind of bad
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,3,"Eddie Redmayne was the best part of this tbh. It was funny when he screamed a lot, I don't know. It wasn't so bad in the beginning, but about halfway it started getting bad. At least it's a funny kind of bad."

Way too much to put into one movie.Plot was very interesting. The CGI? Wow! I've never seen anything like it. Mila Kunis is stunning as usual.I feel like a longer mini series where they deliver into the politics more would've been better.I loved it though.

" You can come down now.
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,6,"An overwhelming and barely coherent science fiction epic that doesn't earn its self satisfied tone.While I was watching this I thought this must be some established franchise like a comic book series or something. But it turns out to be an original movie. Well I say ""original"" it's really just another generic scyfy adventure movie that is familiar to anyone under 40. It tries to cram about four books worth of world building into its run-time so the whole thing feels like a parade of concept art more than a story.Speaking of the story: I'm not sure why exactly but I never felt any real sense of grandiosity or significance. Despite the interplanetary scope of the story and astronomical number of lives presumably at stake, the whole just feels a bit whatever. After the trite opening sequence in which we get a parent-gives-title-character-name-their-late-spouse suggested cliche, Jupiter doesn't really seem to have any real connection to the events happening around except insofar as the narrative insists on telling us. The story mostly seems to just happen TO her in an Alice in Wonderland/Spirited Away type thing, except Alice Liddell was not an utterly forgettable heroin.There's plenty of incidental pleasures: action sequences, futuristic design, the score and all the dialogue overladen with references to this and that can be quite hilarious if you go in with the right attitude.You know how when cartoon characters go to see a science fiction movie and it's the same generic outer space and hover board spiel? Well this is that. A movie that isn't technically that bad, it just has no edge whatsoever."
" Love this! Watched it for the forth time tonight.

Someday they should have special awards for artists in Hollywood, it's really unfair for the amount of job they are doing"
" meh but still entertaining
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,5,"This was definitely interesting but i wouldn't say all together a good movie. It definitely seemed like should have been part of a much larger movie.It was a pretty fun fast paced science fiction movie, pretty bonkers at parts for sure. There was some really unnecessary romance parts that did not seem to fit into the movie at all. A lot of explanation was quickly brushed over and didn't go into the detail it should have. Some of the characters were not explained at all and i have no idea why they were doing what they were doing even though they seemed to have kind of big roles.Cast was great though. Channing Tatum did a good job playing the hero but I wished his back story was a little more explained. I thought Mila Kunis was outstanding even if the movie wasn't all that great her performance in it was good and I think she is a generally good actor. Eddie Redmayne can play a villain pretty well and I would really like to see him in that type of role more often, I was very impressed with him as a bad guy.Over all i would so sure go ahead and check it out. But it no big deal to have never seen it"
" Script ambled along

One cannot rely on CGI to carry the burden of keeping the viewer enthralled. It needed sharper script and plot."
" Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,1,Gobsmackingly brilliant special effects. However that can't hide the fact this is a film that makes no sense whatsoever. Random out of place scenes and characters shoe horned in for no clear or discernible reason. The plot? Utterly no idea. It's clear this film has delusions of grandeur early on. It fancies itself as both a high concept sci-fi and blockbuster in one. It's neither. It's simply a mess held together loosely by some talented A list Hollywood leading actors directed poorly and who like the audience are not clear on what the whole thing is about. Rarely do films make me angry but this one does as I'm puzzled as to how this was ever green-lit.
" Mila Ascending
",2019-12-10 00:00:00,5,"The bad news is that the Jupiter of the title is simply the name of the heroine; the good news that the heroine is played by the beguiling, sloe-eyed Mila Kunis.Glossily photographed by veteran John Toll, the special effects are as usual spectacular but unconvincing; and as usual it does go on (especially the finale). But the Wachowskis have borrowed the fanciful humour of 'Brazil' (along with it's director Terry Gilliam in a cameo appearance) and of 'Total Recall'; and Ms Kunis remains at the heart of the action throughout."

All of the backstory blew my mind. The visuals were insane and unlike anything I've seen before. The story moves very quickly and the world is so rich and fully realized that the characters talk in a lingo from another universe that it's hard to keep up with, but in a good way. And you don't really need to get it. Multiple viewings will only make the dialogue easier to understand.The story was very basic and told in a great way. This is way more SciFi/fantasy than a lot of things. Very much like the rough draft of Star Wars and final brings to the screen the imagination of SciFi from the past.Demands all of your attention for the entire movie because there's is no wasted second. The dialogue is quick and so is the action.It's only a shame that the two most ground breaking movies since The Phantom Menace, this and Valerian were panned by everyone. I wish people knew a good original movie when they saw one so we didn't get the crap we've been getting recently."
" I mean, visually speaking...
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,5,"You could probably watch this film on mute and have a better experience than having to listen to the plot and dialogue. I have a fellow film-buff friend who absolutely swears by the wachowskis as brilliant directors even going so far as to defend Speed Racer (I haven't seen it but I've heard generally poor things), but he hasn't shared his thoughts on Jupiter Ascending for some reason *wink wink*.
The plot is baffling, the dialogue is baffling, there's some Terry Gilliam-esque moments that don't fit in the already messy film. In the same year Eddy Redmane gave an amazing performance in The Danish Girl, he also gives us his performance here. Well I'll give him a pass because he definitely commits to this character!
But yeah, like all the other opinions here, no one can say this film isn't visually stunning so stick it on mute, get some work done and look over every so often to see some truly great visual effects and scenery."
" Great movie
",2019-11-30 00:00:00,8,I don't understand why critics harshly judge this movie. The concept is fresh and original. The acting is amazing. The visual effects are epic
" Wow...Just...wow...
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,2,"The movie has individual elements that aren't worthless, but the whole thing doesn't come together at all. The individual elements are swamped by awful storytelling, weird and incomplete world building, and a far overcrowded narrative that ends up feeling like an entire trilogy in one.One top of all that are either flat or bizarre performances from literally every actor. People talk about Eddie Redmayne's alternatively whispered and shouted performance, but the one performance that's most sadly flat is Channing Tatum's. As you can see through the pair of 21 Jump Street movies, the man has a certain charisma, charm, and humor about him, but as the half-wolf ex-Space Cop who wants wings, he's a non-entity. It's been obvious that the Wachowskis haven't known how to direct actors since The Matrix, but to see them fail to develop this element of their toolbox as filmmakers over 20 years is disappointing.Sure, the movie looks good. There's quality special effects almost throughout and some striking visual compositions with, apparently, some kind of innovative method to filming an aerial chase over Chicago, but the story is just a confusing mess.Jupiter, our main character, is a happenstantial perfect genetic duplicate of a space queen who's already died. The Space Queen had three children, who are fighting over the inheritance of planets used for harvesting the populations. It's really just poorly conceived and executed Marxist pablum (complete with dialogue about capitalism shitting on the little people). And, on top of all of this, which gets dolled out in droning tones of pure exposition, we have just a plethora of images that never really tie the world together cohesively. We're thrown into the deep end from the beginning, which is an interesting contrast to The Matrix where the strange new world got fed to the audience in palatable chunks that made the reveal intriguing.Probably the most frustrating part of the film is the structure, or what could be called structure. It's quite literally exposition, action scene, exposition, action scene, exposition, Kafkaesque bureaucracy (the single best part of the movie complete with Brazil references and Terry Gilliam), exposition, action scenes to the end. There's not a character that feels alive. There's not a character that feels like they're driving the action, in particular Jupiter who just follows from beginning to end.The idea that some independent producer with a lot of money read the screenplay and said, ""Sure, I'll give you $175 million for this"" is mind-boggling. Where is this person? I have much better ways they can spend that kind of money."
" Overacting and sci-fi with no ambition
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,4,Gravity boots? Come on. And Eddie Redmayne's overacting makes this movie nearly unwatchable. But i did finish it and it wasn't terrible.
" Waste
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,1,"After the first half hour of really bad special effects i had had enough, i see why it has a 5.3 rating."
" Jupiter Ascending
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,5,"Hmm, seems like a wannabe Guardians of the Galaxy. This one is awfully underwhelming for a space movie."
" Great movie for the sci-fi fan not so much for Channing Tatum and Milna Kunis Fans
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,8,I loved it. Great story. Character development would have been nice but they didn't have the time. This one movie should have been 3 giving us more time for character development. They story was original.
" When you think you're a good director....
",2019-10-07 00:00:00,1,"Terrible film. There isn't much good about it. I had watched it because it SOUNDED interesting... And maybe someone else could have made this into a film worth watching again... But it just wasn't. It felt like another one of those cheesy superhero films with WAY TOO DAMN MUCH CGI, bad acting, bad writing, plotlines that go nowhere, cringey jokes, etc. It just didn't lean as much on the superhero side of things as the others.The people rating this highly seem to perceive this as a classic, I even saw one person compare this to Blade Runner... Honestly, not sure how their minds are working, and I probably don't want to.It's bad. Don't watch it."
" Hokum fun
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,7,"I know this got smashed by most reviewers but it is good comic book adventure fun. Great sets, costumes and CG.Don't expect a deeply moving plot or script. Just enjoy the ride."
" Has an idiot for a protagonist, but it's still a nice movie
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,6,"They make Mila Kunis' character out to be a sentimental idiot, who's willing to sacrifice THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE, for her family of 5 people... The fact that they writers/director even allowed the plot to go into that direction and allowed Mila Kunis' character to ponder that decision, is a travesty. No human should be shown to be so idiotically dull-minded, as to contemplate the destruction of the human race, just to protect themselves or their family.With that massive flub of a plot hole out of the way; was the movie actually good?: Yeah it's a cool way to keep yourself entertained for 2hrs... I'd really compare it to the Valerian movie, as it's actually very similar. So if you liked the Valerian movie, then you'll probably like this movie as well. There's LOTS of good CGI and lots of action."
" If you don't like Sci-Fi Movies then don't watch them.
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,10,"If you do Watch Sci-Fi movies, then this is an underrated GEM. it has fantastic PLOT, has many surprises and a moral undertone of what people Might do to extend Life. subtle Love story inter tones.Mila Kunis puts in a Strong performance as does the supporting cast. The Storyline moves at good pace and it isn't your Plain Old Run Of The Mill Sci-Fi Movie. everyone i know enjoyed it. The Critcs are just that Critics.Have an open mind and Willing Suspension of disbelief and this is a Great, Not Good, Movie!"
" SiFi Cinderella Story
",2019-09-10 00:00:00,10,"Not quite sure why there are so many haters of this movie, it was awesome! Put off watching it for awhile because reviews said basically that the plot was complicated and didn't make a lot of sense, but it made perfect sense to me, could it by chance be because I am female...? Absolutely love stories where women take the center stage and freaking rock! Need more films like this 😎👍"
" Beyond terrible
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,1,"So bad, bad, bad. I knew I wasn't going to see a good story but this was a mess.World-Building is terrible, logic inconsistent. Just an explosion every few seconds but why should I care if there are no real stakes, characters or worlds to care about?Even the visuals are terrible, as they seem to be made by someone with NO taste at all. Convoluted, way to many bright colours and things everywhere, like a bad trip that gives you headache. CGI looks so fake and artificial, nothing seems real, it looks cheap. Embarrassing, really."
" I still have no idea what I just watched
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,1,"Where to begin: Acting - just horrible, visual effects - too much and hard to see, plot- have no idea and still confused, directing - quit. Overall this was just bad and really wish I could have gotten my money back."
" Can't always trust reviews
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,8,"I blew this movie off because of the low review ratings. I finally watched it, and I loved this movie!!!A lot of action scenes were implausible, but scifi-fantasy movies are implausible."
" Meh
",2019-08-16 00:00:00,5,"The show was ok. The worst part about it was, was the low to high volume ratio. Any scenes with violence I had to turn the volume down and any quiet talking scenes I had to turn the volume up. Really annoying."
" uninteresting, boring.
",2019-08-15 00:00:00,2,"Although I really like sci-fi movies, and it is very hard for me to give almost any movie a really bad rating, I just couldn't find very much decent in this movie, the only reason I could even find to give it two stars, was the acting, which was good. I couldn't even watch the whole movie, after one half way through I just fast forwarded to towards the end. Again, if you ever looked at any of my reviews I never give a rating this low, but the movie was just way to boring silly."
" A good sf
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,6,"Its a very good one , science fiction , action , jokes , love story"
" Fantasy Frolicking
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,7,"Could've done without the ultra brutal home invasion murder intro, the repeated up close & personal toilet bowl cleaning scenes, the ex-military on/off ally guy beating the crap out of the hero as soon as he sees him, and a few other unsavory and/or out of place elements, but overall this is a fun hyperfiction romp that entertains even with all the overdone, headach-inducing special effects. No expense spared in presenting the provocative opulence of the super developed, super smug royal alien regimes. Mila Kunis does a fine job with it all being grounded on her."
" THIS Is the Movie I've Been Waiting For, For SO Long!
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,10,"It's been FAR TOO LONG since there's been a REAL GOOD sci-fi epic, that wasn't over - done to the point of being commercial like so many Tom Cruise flops, and these horribly neglected Disney - ruined Marvel and Star Wars sequels that should just STOP; or sadly under budgeted like indie films which sometimes have decent scripts but usually don't. This film however is the trifecta! Great story, Amazing special effects, and an EXCELLENT cast!!!I HATE spoilers, so I'm cutting myself off before I run off at the mouth, but I'll say this - I think most people rating this movie were watching an entirely different movie, or else only like Jane Eyre!WATCH THIS!!"
" Surprisingly good story
",2019-08-08 00:00:00,8,"The movie is one big cliche. But it's very well done.The movie pays homage to some of the best movies by shamelessly borrowing their tropes. There's Princess Bride with the wedding interrupted, the grunting Wookie-like spaceship pilot, the Hunger Games' tenacious and focused and tireless heroine, and many others.And there's a story with characters you can actually care about. Nicely done storytelling and good production. Recommended."
" Kinda Cool
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,6,This movie had a lot of really cool ideas and visuals. The last third of the movie was too much but the build up was definitely interesting. I'd say it's a good watch on a rainy day.
" This movie is really really bad
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,2,"I ended up fast forwarding through 70% of the movie hoping I'll come to an interesting part. The acting is melodramatic garbage. One guy is coming off as ryan Philippe's character from Cruel Intensions. I think we can all agree that's been done too many times in the past 20yrs. Without giving spoilers...you'll easily pick out the actor who is giving a RIDICULOUS Brando-meets-Zoolander impersonation. The whole movie reeks with pretentious characters. It's awful.If I was to compare this movie to another, I'd think along the lines of Transformers 3. Maybe 1 good action scene???? Bottom line...You would have to be simple minded to enjoy this cheesy movie.I will add... I'd skip this movie if you are mother with a 14-or-younger child. There's just a slight too much nudity to be pg-13 for me to watch with my teenage son."
" Fun action space opera
",2019-08-02 00:00:00,9,"I thought this movie was a lot of fun, including the second time I saw it just now. I've read the criticisms and I don't agree. If you don't understand the plot, you aren't paying attention. I cared about the main characters and the movie kept me in suspense. Maybe people are getting tired of these kinds of movies - if this had come out 20 years ago it would have gotten better ratings. I'm taking one star off because I fast forwarded through some of the action at parts - ""action"" is tedious for me these days."
" trite, juvenile fare with a ridiculous plot
",2019-08-01 00:00:00,2,"Saw it free on Netflix, wasted my money but the surfboarding was cool"
" What could have been
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,2,"For a film boasting Oscar winners and box office draws such as Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis, it is frankly impressive how poor the end product ended up being. A convoluted plot that masquerades as a feminist sci-fi action romp, it never really gets going and besides the fake scientific lingo, the plot is the second most confusing part of the film. Don't waste your time with it, just spin around until you see spots and it will be the same cinematic experience"
" Better than everyone believes.
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,8,"These days people rate movies too unfairly and Jupiter Ascending is one of those movies that continues to get a bad name. Because this was created by the Wachowskis, I think that people went into this thinking that it was going to be the next Matrix and never actually gave it a chance to be its own film.It is a star studded cast that creates a spectacular movie for all to see. An epic tale of ascension, betrayal, love. lust and family. It is visually beautiful with a narrative that while not complex is interesting and entertaining.While this may not be the film that defines the era or one for the ages, it is definitely one that you can easily watch again and again. If given a real chance, it is a film you will come to love."
" just a nice fantastic movie
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,8,"Nothing more .... cast perfect , vis eff. perfect , interesting scenario and many creative things in this lovely movie ... love it"
" the guiltiest of pleasures
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,7,"Extremely entertaining. beastly and creative sci-fi action action, although there are a few sloppy scenes. absolutely phenomenal score. filled with beautiful and mesmerizing sci-fi images. very imaginative. interesting premise.i can admit that this movie is objectively bad. it's filled with flaws, like cheesy or bad dialogue and some hilarious over-acting. i laugh out loud at a bunch of unintentional humor.but in the end, i laugh at those parts, i smile at all the sci-fi images, my eyes are glued to the action scenes, and the music gives me goosebumps. a very fun time for me (4 viewings, 7/10/2020)"
" Cool Effects
",2019-06-29 00:00:00,5,The special effects are great. Eddie Redmayne is hilariously bad
" Second watch...
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,10,"I remember watching this while I was on vacation a few years ago, now I really wish I had watched it on the big screen when it was released!The CGI in this movie is by far the best of its time and frankly kicks the stuffing out of the latest Marvel offerings! Ironically, unlike the Marvel offerings this is a brilliant story and regardless of the morons that suggest that this is a; 'mish-mash', I believe it holds up exceptionally well! Think classic family feuding power struggle and add some sci-fi to it and it is a proven story. Yes, they could have filled in some gaps but it would have made it a three hour movie! We all know that long movies that are just regurgitating story parts (Endgame is a classic example of how NOT to over indulge in superfluous story lines) get 'tedious' so live with it!The acting is brilliant, by everyone, even the CGI characters are so good you can start imagining their own stories! And as for Mila Kunis; just wow! She is a tightly packaged power house of an actor that could carry, literally, any role! The next Cleopatra epic MUST have her in the lead and Channing Tatum has to be her Mark Antony!! He is another one of those actors that as well as being more than capable, makes you feel he was the character he is playing his entire life!On a side note, I actually see Sean Bean's character as the only 'weak' part and that is probably because the Wachowski's didn't allow him enough time to develop it! Eddie Redmayne was brilliant as the 'bad guy', he has a natural talent for just appearing menacing and for someone so young, he gave the impression that he was a seasoned 'bad guy'! Douglas Booth did the 'handsome evil prince' bit well and Tuppence Middleton was pretty good as the third leg of the 'oil baron like' family.One comment that I have to make is that the music score is so obviously partially ripped off the Star Trek movie scores! Michael Giacchino probably saved a bit of time in the studio by simply transposing some of the 2009/2013 themes!Synopsis: I really enjoyed this movie, it had a great story (contrary to the downers!) and the CGI was absolutely amazing. The music fitted well but was obviously replicated from the Star Trek franchised themes! The acting is great and it is truly a non-stop action packed sci-fi masterpiece! I highly recommend viewing on a big screen though, smaller screens will not do it justice."
" One of the worst movies i have ever seen
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,1,"The movie is hard to watch. Genuinely terrible writing, some of the acting is terrible, the visual effects are cool at points but not nearly good enough to save this train wreck."
" Excellent Sci-fi Flick!!
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,9,"You just can't go wrong with handsome, talented, amazing Channing Tatum!! All the A listers did an awesome job on the movie...Eddy, Mila, Channing, all of them! It's action packed, good story line. Give it a try!!!"
" This is high adventure sci-fi with a solid story, good acting, and great special effects.
",2019-06-16 00:00:00,8,"While Jupiter Ascending is post production 3D it is sill fairly good.
I personally don't get all the negative reviews. This is high adventure sci-fi with a solid story, good acting, and great special effects. I consider it an epic and one of the better movies I've seen."
" Disapoited
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,1,"I simply hated this film, OK?! I just did it was awful it nearly bored me to death!"
" Her Majesty, Jupter !
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,7,"Just saw this title. It is a sci-fi movie including plot of present and future dwelling story that not understandable by Jupiter Jones (Milla Kunis) and nor by us. So confusing! Why Jupiter called her majesty and if she is so special then she must have a unique power, but she is a normal woman from earth. Two villains from different universe captured her to kill, but every time Caine (Channing Tatum) come and help her, just the story! Not many subplots! Title obtaining and getting award after killing people are new imagination to future. Photography work is good, galaxies, planets, space journey and high tech technologies are attraction of the movie which are covering the weakness of an illogical story. In acting side Mill Kunis did her job well as a confused woman from earth. Sometimes she looks like after married Aishwarya Roy from bollywood. Tatum also perfect in his roughly roll. His flying shoes are a highlighted attraction. Rest are Okays. Background score is also well. Not much recommended. Only if you want to see a sci-fi without any burden on mind then watch this."
" Good enough scifi film
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,7,"I can see that lots of reviewers hated this film, but those who don't like it have had their say and don't have to rewatch it. This is a pretty straightforward story that is interesting and easy to get into.Channing Tatum even behaves pretty well here. Mila Kunis, though not a great actor, does a decent job in this one and Sean Bean is finally given a role which doesn't require him to be insufferable, as he is usually playing an unlikable character.This isn't Dune, but at least it isn't John Carter. I liked the film and I don't really understand the hostility that so many reviewers have expressed toward it. The effects are good and the fight scenes drag on a little more than I like, but overall it's good enough. I give it a 7."
" Not for everyone
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,7,"Liked: -The worldbuilding
-The overarching premise of the story
-The action scenes
-Design and presentation of the sci-fi portionsDisliked: -Seems a bit rushed at times
-The storytelling itself, I didn't care much about Jupiter's family etc.
-A bit overly focused on the romance aspect, for my tastes"
" Dune descending
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,1,"If Dune (1984) sits at the zenith, then this film sits at the nadir. It feels remarkably similar to the former -- the essential scarce resource, the unassuming ""messiah"" -- but all the inventiveness and emotional power of the former film has been lost.(And there's a horrible pompous performance from Eddie Redmayne. What was he, or the director, thinking?)"
" Ehh
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,3,Considering the actors cast in this movie it was terrible. You can tell the actors werent really into their rolls and some of the fighting scenes were a little much.
" Underrated SF-Space Opera
",2019-05-09 00:00:00,10,"In a market that loves comic book live action films, this movie should be a hit. It is beautifully shot and entertaining while keeping your attention on the mildly complex plot. I am not sure why one critic complained that the special effects were trying to wow us; I thought that is why many of us love SF films.Jupiter Jones is an orphan raised in poverty by her flawed but well meaning and hard working uncle, aunt, and extended family. During the course of the movie we learn that she also has ties to in intergalactic society and to the elites who hold title to the Earth. The overlords of Earth are loosely regulated by a Commonwealth government comprised of a military and bureaucracy. One critic complained that the villains of the story are flawed spoiled brats. This may be true, but which of us is not routinely confronted by selfish and flawed business men and women, Byzantine bureaucracies, and everyday workers and soldiers trying to live lives in the midst of competition and treachery way above their pay grades?The movie was criticized as being an overly complex ripoff of Dune. That critique is inaccurate for at least two reasons. First, beyond the movie being set in a feudal society, it bears little resemblance to Dune; and second, the copycat critique is more relevant to Star Wars than to this flick. Contrasting this movie to Dune shows why this film is not too complex to be fun to watch.For example, while Dune's arch villain, Harkonnen, is a selfish and craven psychopath, he is a brilliant not fullly successful branch of a eugenics program aiming to create a super man. In Jupiter Ascending, the villains sit atop a society of genetically engineered underlings, a lower classes each designed for a specific function. Jupiter's villains enjoy and sell unlimited youth at the cost of billions of other people's lives. They strive for perpetuation of a stagnant society that views people as chattel. It is a sumptuous but soulless dystopia. The civilization in Dune, by contrast, is attempting to develop humanity beyond its limits while preventing social collapse into a religious war. Jupiter Ascending does not attempt to mimic the Dune epic nor is its plot so complex that it has ambitions to being Doctor Zhivago or Crime and Punishment. Instead it is a comic book style space opera that reflects many of the themes of today: poverty, avarice, and the temptation to lookout for oneself while ignoring the cost to others.Jupiter Jones is not balancing peace at the cost of perpetuating evil. Instead she is a hero faced with a simple choice: become rich and forever young or protect the defenseless. That my friends is a recipient for a great movie night with friends or family."
" First movie review is an impassioned plea
",2019-05-06 00:00:00,1,"Half way through watching this movie, I stopped it, got in my car, and immediately returned it to the Redbox. It was a statement that nobody witnessed but I needed to make. It's awful to the point of unwatchable. A new sci-fi movie by the Wachowskis should be a treat, instead they thought it better to insult us. I beg you to stay away, you literally have no excuse now."
" Uranus Falling
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,2,"After charming the knickers off me with Cloud Atlas the Wachowski Brothers/Sisters/Cousins/Uncles/Aunts fall hard on their faces with this turgid, confusing mess. This is the movie equivalent of those manic, chaotic attempts at art drawn in crayon or charcoal on large sheets of paper found on the floor in abandoned insane asylums. This is not a compliment. I cannot possibly imagine what was going on in the heads of the writer/director team when they spewed out the words that formed the screenplay or how they could have approved the final cut as anything remotely resembling coherent. If you were to throw the movie into a shredder and have it come out the other end in a completely different order it would make just as much ""sense"" as the released version.Baby Jupiter is born in a container filled with illegals on a ship bound for the US. She is a girl without a country. She grows up to be Mila Kunis (30 at the time of filming, but looking about 40, somehow) and earns a living scrubbing the insides of toilet bowls. After a mix-up at a fertility clinic she's kidnapped by aliens who want her eggs and...sheesh, I really can't even recite the ""plot"" beyond this point as it made absolutely zero sense. Channing Tatum (back when Hollywood kept trying to make him a thing) shows up as a dog/man with no personality (John Candy he ain't!), some things happen, color and movement fill the screen, words are said, none of it adds up.Eddie Redmayne (who looks like a human skeleton with wafer thin ham super-glued onto it) is the villain of the piece (of crap) and delivers the most mis-played performance in movie history. Tatum completely Seagals his performance and is so comatose he might as well have done is acting asleep while an off-camera team of puppeteers control him with rods and strings. His character is called Cain Wise, btw. Yeah, Cain Wise. Those words don't even go together! Tuppence Middleton appears and disappears. Something to do with bees and Sean Bean. Seriously...I don't have a clue what this movie is supposed to be and I'm a man of noble intelligence.The Wachowskis seem to be under the impression that their action style from The Matrix is still passable or groundbreaking all these years later. It's not, and there's nothing exciting about the chaotic, physically impossible, and weightless action scenes that burn out our patience and kill any chance at further suspense. Though they are not the only ones guilty of this, as this style has continued into many of today's blockbusters and virtually every DCEU and MCU movie. I think that the time to return to real, in-camera action, practical, believable cinematography, and angles chosen for grounded, observable viewpoints is well overdue. From about the 30-minute mark, I could not tell what on Earth (or Jupiter) was going on or what I was looking at. I'm not joking or exaggerating. All I could make out was that Man-Dog repeatedly crashes his ships into things he doesn't like and is seemingly impervious to the vacuum of space.Oh, and having the character called Jupiter and having her actually go to Jupiter is one helluva heavy-handed non-metaphor."
" The best part of the film is the title.
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,3,"The film certainly has an intriguing title.
It began well, an expectant couple who for some unknown reason speak English, but lapse into another language intermittently. The husband is murdered, the child becomes an adult who works as a cleaner. Alls well and good so far!
Suddenly without any explanation, we are transported to another world. I began to tune out at this point. The films then switches between the family life of the title character Jupiter, and the other world. I gave up at this point.
A story that makes no sense, filled with unlikable characters. You'll find copies of this DVD at a charity shop near you. That is where we bought our copy!"

",2019-03-10 00:00:00,2,"The plot could have been interesting but the film is so bogged down in explaining things that we don't see anything!It's painfully tedious, Mila Kunis is awful in this (everyone is) and Eddie Redmayne, while the funnest character, was the worst actor in this."
" Worth a watch
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,6,"It's not a bad movie, but it's not amazing either, but it is worth a watch.What's good: Great visuals, competent sci-fi story
What's meh: Casting is a bit off, Mila Kunis is ok, but lacks presence of a lead character. The dialogue is a bit hard to hear at times, which is important because there's a lot of detail.Pacing, this is a hard one. It's like a slow action movie. I quite like this, it's refreshing to have the time to spend in this quite detailed universe, but some may struggle with this and get board."
" just enough crazy to keep things interesting.
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,7,"]Jupiter Ascending: 7 out of 10: An illegal alien from Russia named Jupiter finds out she is the secret chosen one while cleaning toilets in Chicago. So it is to outer space to claim her royal heritage but her newfound ascendancy to the throne threatens the power balance among three royal siblings each more overacted than the last. Can she and her half human half dog companion/love interest defeat the other royals and win the day?Let's talk about John Carter for a minute, the movie, not some presidential sibling you never heard off, John Carter was a major tent pole film that cost a fortune to make that no one actually showed up to the theater to watch. The reviews were mediocre and toys filled the shelves of Big Lots unsold.Then a funny thing happened people started watching it on their favorite streaming service. And they kind of liked it. It was flawed and derivative but it also had a big budget that was on the screen and fun action beats with good looking people riding to the rescue of other good looking people. In other words, it wasn't an unpleasant watch. It was stupid and confusing but fun.Jupiter Ascending shares a lot in common with John Carter. It had an even worse box office performance and even harsher reviews. Yet I admit I had fun watching it. Very stupid fun but fun nevertheless. There is also a hidden side to Jupiter Ascending that even John Carter didn't have. It is clear that there is a very good three-hour film out there that was chopped down to two hours. There are parts of this film that as a standalone are as brilliant and imaginative as anything you will see.Let's talk about what works (kind off). The Wachowski siblings have generated an interesting tale and very good world building with a theme that would be familiar to any Matrix aficionados. The world building is often done organically where the audience is supposed to just watch and hope the details are filled in again later. Eventually, everything comes together in an admittedly confusing mess. Don't think too hard and enjoy the ride is definitely top advice for watching this.There is a rather long tribute to the movie Brazil in the middle of this film. It is completely out of the tone of the rest of the movie and it is truly out of left field. It is also easily the most entertaining part of the film. I have to admire that they cut so much plot and character development but managed to leave this in here.Some of the acting is actually quite good plus it has Sean Bean going well full Sean Bean. That alone makes the film that much more watchable.Okay, so what went wrong? Well, we only have time for a few highlights cause this is a very long list.If I see one more movie where the lead character finds out they are the mystical chosen one through no actions of their own I am shooting the TV. I have no problems, in theory, of the love interest rescuing the damsel in distress but good lord this movie does it every twenty minutes. Not to mention he, of course, rescues her at the last possible second. It is as if we were watching a dozen James Bond defusing the bomb endings strung together.Channing Tatum does a fine job as the errant knight to Mila Kunis's princess but making him a half human half dog was shall we say is an interesting hurdle in the film. You are a better person than I if your mind didn't go immediately to John Candy's half human half dog character in Spaceballs. Then they go on to explain that Channing Tatum's character is a bad boy who has lost his pack and he was court-martialed cause he was a biter. Did Wes Anderson write Isle of Dogs after screening this film? Channing plays his character as someone who is loyal and protecting his master rather than a traditional love interest. Mila, on the other hand, is clearly smitten and declares it will work out cause she loves dogs. I guess Mila will be packing a jar of peanut butter for the honeymoon.And now to the highlight of the awfulness. Not since Halle Berry put on a catsuit has an Oscar winner given such an awful performance in such close proximity to their Oscar win. Actually, scratch that. Catwoman may be a worse film than Jupiter Ascending but Eddie Redmayne's performance blows Halle Berry out of the water. How bad is it? He won the Razzie... in a year that had both Pixels and Fifty Shades of Grey. The man beat out Kevin James for God's sake. He apparently is doing a Drunk William Shatner imitating Marlon Brando's Godfather. I am on the record for not liking Eddie Redmayne in movies. He is one of those actors that just rubs my rhubarb the wrong way. But I am on the cusp of changing my mind. He is so awful here it is mesmerizing. To paraphrase Tropic Thunder you never go full Shatner.I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of course but the bottom line was I actually enjoyed myself. It is clear that there was a lot of great world building that didn't make the screen and there will be no sequels forthcoming. But don't be surprised if this is a cult classic twenty years from now. There is just enough crazy to keep things interesting."

The whole movie is a full-time CG, what kind of plot is worse than WOW's propaganda film. There was no consistency in the forced appearance of three successors."
" CGI and bizarre make-up.
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,1,"I can only assume that this mess is aimed at twelve-year old gamers who would enjoy the endless CGI chases in search of a screenplay. It held my interest for nearly ten minutes but I was bored out of my mind for the remaining 117 tedious minutes of colours, noise and nonsense. Special effects enhance science fiction films when used sparingly and intelligently to tell a story, here an idiotic story is tacked on to the CGI. This brainless epic is comparable to Plan 9 from Outer Space in terms of story-telling but sadly with a thousand times the budget of that notorious failure."
" Seven out of ten for effort. Hard to get into but ultimately entertaining.
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,7,"I can't remember what made me want to watch this movie: I must have heard something good or at least interesting about it somewhere.
Anyway, I enjoyed it, it's a bit of a mess but somehow satisfying."
" Enjoyable film, really.
",2019-02-08 00:00:00,9,"I do not get all the hate on this flick. Jupiter Ascending is a visually stunning movie, for one, with many great decors. Imaginative SciFi design, really. And it has a fairly exciting story to boot. Mila Kunis may not be the world's greatest actress (hello 'American Psycho 2!'), but she does a decent job pulling off her part. Enjoyable film, really."
" What a shame
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,8,"Despite this movies problems ,I found it an incredibly fun universe to be immersed in . Very disappointed that it flopped as I think a trilogy would of given the story an opportunity to explain itself so to speak. Credit to the Wacowski's for creating yet another mind blowing world ."
" Great movie
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,10,Great movie and I've watched it multiple times already!!! First of all it has a Matrix feeling to it because of the Wachowski siblings. After rewatching it several times I actually felt bad for the Abraxes siblings. Basically they lived for centuries through the rejuvenation gel of the planet farms. The human goop. Over 19 millenniums and the Mom (Mila Kunis) had enough and had her son kill her. He was devastated by this and actually loved her so much. But the soundtrack in the movie made all the children seem like Villians. It takes a lot of creativity to make a movie as brilliant as this.
" A Visually Exciting Sci Fi Action Adventure
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,7,"31 March 2015. Jupiter Ascending is a conglomeration of a number of sci fi movies packaged into a epic sci fi adventure thriller. The intermixing of regular earth and the sci fi royal epic theme at the beginning of the movie adds a nice feature from most sci fi movies. Thus, there are elements of royalty DUNE (1984). There are the requisite monster-looking aliens as from Keanu Reeve's horror movie Constantine (2005) or British television rebooted Dr. Who series (2005) or skateboarding moves from Spiderman (2002). There are the requisite battle scenes that echo those of Ender's Game (2013), The Matrix Revolution (2003). And the bureaucracy of the classic sci fi Brazil (1985), swatches of set designs from Blade Runner (1982) and Star Wars: The Revenge of the Sith (2005).While much of this sci fi movie isn't original, there are several scenes that stand out. Mila Kunis offers up some nicely balanced and underplayed comical lines that shine in this sci fi movie as well as other nicely played witty lines from other characters with the similar flavor from the occult horror teenage hit Buffy The Vampire Slayer television series (1997). Perhaps the movie was a bit just too ambition and a bit scattered it all its attempts to be everything. Yet the attempt at the elegant, larger than life royal dynasty angle was almost well played, almost as large a scale as that suggested in Isaac Asimov's Foundation classic sci fi book trilogy (1951-53). This an engaging sci fi movie that's somewhat slow in a few places, but amazing in its visual action pieces though perhaps even almost too much."
" Don't know why it didn't do well in theaters...
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,8,"I've watched this a few times already and I enjoyed it! It's entertaining to me but critics dissect EVERY aspect of the film, which has no affect on me at all."
" Barely entertaining, definitely not the amazing movie I was expecting
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,5,"Considering the premise, directors and cast I had very had expectations for this movie. What a letdown. While visually pleasing, the story, pacing and movie as a whole feel completely disjointed."
" Battle of the Queens: Jupiter Ascending
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,2,"Almost every actor in this film is under 30. The script is obviously written by someone under 30 as well, because the script is wretched. An evil male queen (similar to the Roman Emperor in ""Quo Vadis"") wants to destroy the good Polish female queen. She is saved by the new acting version of Dolph Lundgren. It is hard to rescue a one star script with 8 star sets and special effects (the art direction, sets, special effects and makeup are outstanding). Unfortunately, there are no actors for the director to direct. The acting is almost as bad as the writing, but it is easy to blame novice actors and actresses for this turkey; they are merely spouting illiterate lines written by an amatuer.
In the first five minutes of the film we hear a line about something that is the most rare thing in the universe. Any A student in English knows that the superlative form of rare is rarest, not most rare. So with an illiterate, adolescent script, the film is doomed from the start. What a shame; the production values are extremely well done (even with the guy on the roller blades (oh, I'm sorry, Air Jordans). We don't get enough of the evil male queen, but we get plenty of the Polish family at the dinner table. We don't get enough of the dinosaur soldiers, but we get too much of an army of skinny people, led by young skinny people. In other words, there is no room for older adults in the future. Good luck with that idea. A subplot love story between Spock on Steroids and the girl from That Seventies Show (dead ringer for her) can't save the film as well. The Shanghai sequence gives me the queasy feeling that there may have been Chinese investors for this film (hence the silly Chinese girl on the aircycle). They may never invest in a Hollywood sci-fi film again. Giant spaceships right out of Battlestar Galactica plus the usual smaller ships from the Star Wars trilogy seem to be fairly ridiculous. The extravagant and interesting visuals and lively music just cannot make up for the lame script. Better viewed with the sound off. It really isn't the worst film of the year (well, maybe for the amount of money spent it is), but it is certainly the worst written major film in the last fifty years."
" A decent sci-fi movie
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,6,"Jupiter Ascending is a decent and enjoyable sci-fi movie with a unique premise. Mila Kunis, Sean Bean and Channing Tatum are all really good. It has impressive visuals and CG. However, some bad performances (Eddie Redmayne especially) and some weak attempts at humour diminish it."
" Uranus Descending
",2018-12-19 00:00:00,1,"If anyone is thinking ""i really want to see this."" P*ss in your own eyes or punch yourself into a stupor, it's more enjoyable and it will take less time to work out the number of flaws in that plan than to work out the number of flaws in Jupiter Ascending.
I would rather get drunk from the p*ss in numerous tramps' pants.
Terrible film, occasional cool visuals but no other redeeming qualities. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
" So cheesy and stupid it's brillant; a 1950s sci-fi styled movie.
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,6,"Oh my god, is this move ever so gleefully stupid!!! All attempts at me ever taking it seriously was erase from existence when the aliens said they had to kill off the Earth's original inhabitants.... we are then treated to a scene of several alien ships KILLING OFF THE DINOSAURS!!!This movie is so cheesy and so lovably stupid it's just brilliant. It's practically a modern-day unintentional parody. I almost died from laughter."
" Great Movie, novel story, great effects, very under rated.
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,8,"This movie was slated by critics, underperformed in theaters and it became trendy to hate it. It's a big scale scifi action epic. It's not in the same rank as The Matrix but stream it in 4K with your surround sound cranked up and enjoy. It's often the way of things that movies rank on opening and ""critics "" pile on. This will be better reviewed over time, and just like Bladerunner ( probaly a better movie ), design and theme elements will pop up elsewhere."
" Nearly fell asleep
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,4,I wasn't even tired either. This movie blows. Not worth anyone's time.
" Mila Kunis was wasted with ridiculousness
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,1,"I actually just watched this movie again after forgetting how bad it was the first time I saw it a couple years ago. The trailer is really great and I love watching Mila Kunis, so I got hooked into watching this film again! I won't be pulled in a third time. I thought the initial premise was interesting, and I was definitely interested in following Mila on her journey. But things quickly turned into the ridiculous territory as one fight scene blended into another ridiculous fight scene. This movie reminded me of the endless fight scenes in the Transformer movies where Transformers just kept crashing into each other. The over the top music was just loud and extremely annoying. Whenever Mila had a quiet scene, I was drawn in again. She had a couple of funny lines here and there that helped keep me awake a little longer. Don't get drawn in by the trailer. I recommend people skip this one. (I just watched the trailer again. It had Sean Bean in it from Game of Thrones that drew me in even more. It's a great trailer! I couldn't help myself, but be warned...don't take the bait)"
" How could you take awesome actors and spectacular effects and make such a bad movie?! How?
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,3,"Those Washowski sisters must have a special talent - maybe they destroy everything they touch? This movie had such a great potential - a fresh idea about a generically modified alien race, that looks for identical genes in people anywhere in the universe. Thats ok. Effects - ok! Actors - decent. And then here we go: Story - barely existing, foggy and pathethic. Dialogues - laughable dull mess, written by a bot, who was forced to read all Paulo Cohelo books. Characters- they are as stereotipical as they come. Chaning Tatum with puppy ears rocks though. The whole thing was painful to watch - there wasn't too much story to follow and the actions of the characters did not make any sense.Horrible movie, really. I think whoever wrote this should stop taking drugs and hormone pills - it ia obviously bad for your brain.Please make a remake with a real story."
" A SciFi Story About Power and Family With Great Visuals and Effects
",2018-11-09 00:00:00,8,"Jupiter Acending looks great, the effects, the action, the actors, the costumes, the scenes - all are outstanding. At the heart of the story it is about family and making the right choices when presented with great power for the protagonist.The overall story is decent, but does not get bogged down with geek speak or superheroes which is a trap a lot of scifi movies fall into. Definitely entertaining to watch and has a few funny moments too.The movie never takes itself too seriously and is watchable for the whole family. Even though there are no superheros in it, there is a pair of cool flying boots that are better than starlord's boots and make people want them as much as Marty McFly's hoverboard. One of the better SciFi movies in recent times and is accessible to those not even into that genre."
" A REAL Ghost in a (an empty...) Shell !!!
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,1,"If you wanna take a look at an example of ""Emptyness"" in modern cinema, then give a try to this ""Pure Jewel"" of..... nuthin' !
Such an amount of money spent in special effects should at least tend to give some visual successes, but even this doesn't happen !
The bad guy sounds ridiculous, the good one IS actually ridiculous (a kind of CHEAP Starlord.....without any charism....)......the plot is as thin as an extra-thin rolling-paper... but do not make the mistake to think that it's actually smokable !!! :-)"
" What the heck happened to these film makers
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,1,"Yeah. Just yeah. I had to watch this film just to see if it is as bad as everyone says it is and yes. Yes it is. The film look pretty but the plot is loaded convoluted cr$p, both lead actors are known for being awful actors and display it well in this film. If they ever do want to continue or reboot The Matrix, do NOT let these directors do anything but work on the special effects."
" A message to all the imbeciles who didn't appreciate this movie/truth :
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,10,"Time truly is the most precious commodity in the universe. I know, I know.. You don't get it now but you will adore the truths from this movie after you pass 60..."
" So much I want to like about this film but it somehow goes horribly wrong
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,4,"This film has all the components to make it great. But it just doesn't fit together. I don't know enough about film to offer a diagnosis, but it feels like pacing. Somehow the plot progresses with a languid pace which isn't really the right move for an action-oriented film. The characters don't really develop. The jokes fall flat. The romance isn't very convincing. Bad writing? Bad editing? It's hard to say, but painful to watch, sort of like a mid-season baseball game that goes on for 16-innings between two teams you don't care about. You just want it to be over."
" Second best SciFi movie ever
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,5,"The best is of course Flash Gordon, which clearly cannot be topped. But let's keep serious: Every movie with Mila Kunis is worth watching, so I give it some stars. The scenes on earth portraying her russian emigree family are outright funny. Mila kleening the bathroom: Priceless. All the SciFi stuff (plot, characters) gets 0 stars and is more or less a waste."
" I Only Watched It For Sean Bean
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,5,I don't know what I expected out of this film - but I didn't expect what I watched. I watched the first hour then I fast-forwarded it to Sean Bean's parts - just to watch him. If I was a few years younger I'm sure I would have enjoyed the movie more than I do. I was disappointed with the film at my age.5/10
" Not what I was expecting!
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,8,"After hearing, from friends, family and pretty much the whole country that this movie was a waist of time, plus all the criticism from the critic's. I decided on not waisting my time nor my money on watching this movie. I watched it tonight, after years of putting it off. Despite some visual effects, and a few spots of questionable acting scenes. I came to my own conclusion. The movie that everyone hated and gave horrible reviews, really wasn't as horrible, as was made to believe. I will say it's budget and gross sales was a disaster, but if you just watch the movie, without expecting it just to be ""bad"" just because, then it could actually surprise you. I liked the movie over all, and if I could go back to it's opening to watch it. I most definitely would have paid to have seen it in a theater."
" I enjoyed it, so...I don't care
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this. I liked the script even with the really silly parts (ie Jupe and the bees). The acting was really well done. It felt kinda like watching a comic book. I love comic books so, that's not a diss. I read some of the ""goofs"" and such and a lot of them can be explained away. As my late father use to tell people, ""Just watch the movie and shut up"".Now. Jupe (Jupiter). I love her. I love her more as a female action hero because she's more down to Earth...get it? Down to Earth? Anyway, most action heroines are either super strong, super smart, super fast, etc. Jupe is just human. She ain't got none of that. She makes stupid human mistakes. She's a smartass like a regular human. She defiant. She can't really fight, but she can slap around a bad guy who can't fight either. She's smart enough to duck when somebody is shooting laser beams at her. She's not taking heels when she should be taking sneakers. And most of all, she knows where to put her knee when a guy puts her in a choke hold. That's awesome. Caine. Caine is hunky. The end. He's half man, half wolf and has prosthetic wings. He can kick butt, too. What the heck do you have to think about?Her Earthly family is hilarious. Her Reoccurrence family is hilarious too, just in a ""they're all nutcases"" sort of way.I like the action. I like the storyline. I wish I could find out what happens after as I'm sure there should be others that want to nimble on the Earth.You should watch it."
" I don't understand the poor reviews, movie was great. A watch repeatedly great.
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,10,"I have no idea why such bad reviews but I enjoyed the movie enough to have seen it multiple times. Graphics are amazing, story line is pretty good (not perfect but I have an uncanny ability to solve movies in the first ten minutes). It is one of the rare ones I didn't know the ending of in the first minutes. Maybe that's why I like it, and others don't. The plot isn't transparent, makes you think, and is above all else....unique. A nice twist to the typical movies of this genre. If you have a good tv, and surround sound, give it a try."
" Enjoyable for fans of epic Sci-Fi
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,5,"I like creative art design, high levels of atmosphere and immersion and creative background lore. I liked Pandorum, Edge of Tomorrow, Event Horizon and The Chronicles of Riddick.This movie has a simple plot but I like the very creative background lore of the presented universe. To the critics: This universe is not more implausible than the one in Star Wars. Art design of the space ships and stations is also positively non-typical and reminded me of Warhammer 40k. Visuals and effects were superb.If the plot was better - and the presented unique universe offers a manifold of opportunities - this movie could have been a must watch for Sci-Fi fans"
" Can't recommend this to anyone

It's a gold painted turd.
High production quality, expensive cgi, and OK acting, but plot is 0/10.I'd pay to not have to watch it again."

Maybe they should let the Sci-fi ""Fae readers"" rate this as people clearly don't have a clue what's popular in the fantasy book world! This movie was amazing!! Visuals and all! Tatum was the perfect High Fae... of course he didn't refer to himself in those terms but that's what he was in the ""Fae"" world!"
" Large crowds of stupid less evolved homo-sapiens.
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,10,"The negative reviewers of this movie prove a very dangerous thesis. That cognitively (I did or did not just make up that word.) challenged less-evolved humans ( Those whom are not right-brain dominant.) should NOT be allowed to write movie reviews or vote. Stupidity has a momentum all its own and can cause disasters of universal proportions.
 First of all, I am not an expert in movies. No one is. Just as there are no experts in poetry either. All anyone can do is offer informed and studied opinion and in my informed and studied opinion Jupiter Ascending is a gloriously fun and entertaining movie. Is it extraordinary? I don't feel so but since in my opinion I've only seen one that came close and that was Lawrence of Arabia. Peter O'toole is definitely in my top ten of greatest actors. 
 Sorry, I digress. After reading hundreds of negative reviews about this movie the one consistent theme throughout all of them was that the reviewers wanted specific things from the movie before actually seeing it. They kept harping about how everything was so shallow and not fleshed out. It was as if they wanted a great movie without themselves having to work at making it a great movie. An audience brings a great movie to the theatre. Your imagination should be flying even before you get to the theatre. But obviously these reviewers left their imaginations at home (If they even possess one.) because to say this movie is lacking (in my opinion) in anything is ludicrous.
 The first time I watched this film I had no knowledge of it, hence no preconceived notions. Just the title and companion graphics peeked my interest enough to watch the trailer. I watched it immediately. I was still unaware of the backstory to this film even though I saw it for the first time in fall of 2017. I was amazed, truly amazed. As of this writing I've watched it dozens of times and every time my imagination fills in just a little more of the Universe that the W's created. This movie gives you just enough in all the right ways so YOU can CREATE an incredible story.
 Just a few more things and I'll leave you to watch this wonderful movie. After you do, then come back and read these reviews again and you will see some of their ideas on the film are completely wrong. The reviewers keep screaming about plot blanks. That the characters get from one point to another with no continuity. This is patently false. Not once did I ever lose the thread of what was taking place. Of course, I have an imagination so I don't need everything explained. But that's just me...
 If you're a voracious reader like myself you tend, or always perhaps, see the novel in movie form. With great attention to detail you fill in the blanks of the scene the author is describing. With movies, especially this movie, the directors have given you the most glorious visuals and as always the dialogue is there for context. It is up to you to create this stunning world you have been given a glimpse of. I wish you could see it the way I saw it, with an utter lack of reference but please do your best. Never take an opinion on faith, even if that opinion is accepted as fact by millions. Ones opinion can be a tragedy. Millions blindly following that same opinion can be an election.10/10"

" Could have been a new classic

Its extremely boring, the plot doesn't make sense and the actor walk around with an facial expression saying: what I'm doing in this mess? Above all that's the movie is pretentious and tries to be ""serious"" which fails pretty dismantle. The worst actor in this mess is the evil guy that walks around and whispers all the time. I guess the director thought that would be cool or creepy but it was nothing like that. Me and my son laugh so hard at this stupidity. Another extremely silly scene is the one in the barn where the bees attacks the queen but she doesn't get hurt. Then this moron that hangs around with the queen says: well you don't get hurt because the bees are trained not to hurt royalties. Really???? Hahahahahahaha If you have a really good patients or an ocean of time that you don't know how to spend on anything better you can sit through this train wreck. Otherwise I suggest you switch off after 10 minutes. It doesn't get any better anyway"

The sci fi genre audience is smart, and the story should be believable - but due to massive gaps in story it fells like its made for dumb people who want to just see action. The graphics are stunning, but character development is poor. Come on, the girl discovers advanced tech and knows how to use them intuitively? And why does everyone keep saving them, the premise of rebirth is so stupid. The earlier movie the cloud atlas atleast had some story even though the execution was lacking. The best the Wachowskis have done is the matrix trilogy, especially the first film. It has been downhill since. Enjoy the movie for graphics, its a one time watch and forget."
" Don't Call This Science Fiction...or Cinema
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,1,"There is virtually no cinema craft here, they didn't even try. Its basically Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis mumbling their lines in monotone in front of a green screen, surrounding by far more talented British thespians. Aside from that, its a CGI cartoon. So little attention is to the art of filmmaking, its as though they were mocking it. Great Science Fiction has always hinged on great storytelling, without that, there's really no point."
" They tried too hard...
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,4,"Star Trek vs Star Wars, and I'm not a fan of either. A bit too CGI, but nevertheless very well done. I think the Wachovski brothers tried just too hard to bring us another Matrix-style spectacle, but this was a bit overdone. Not everything makes sense here, but it is still an adrenaline-fueled adventure ride, despite lack of a good plot!"
" Garbage!
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,1,"The storyline made no sense and it was boring in my opinion. This could have been a wonderful movie, but i feel everything felt rushed. Some of the actors were terrible! I am a big fan of sci fi movies, but not this one, that's for sure. Very disappointed."

" Jupiter Ascending ironically descends into an incomprehensible space opera.
",2018-06-16 00:00:00,4,"In an age where blockbusters are either sequels, reboots or part of a cinematic universe, it is absolutely refreshing to witness an ambitious original epic. But this...this was not the way to do it. Before you comment ""this had so many good ideas though!"" I am not reviewing a conceptualised thesis of what the film could've been, I am simply critiquing what was shown to me in the film. It is not my fault that The Wachowski's primarily focused on world building rather than constructing a cohesive story. The story...well...is about Jupiter Jones who discovers she has intergalactic ancestry that dictates her as the rightful owner of Earth. A powerful family attempt to force her to abdicate those rights so that they can harvest people to fuel their genetic industry. C'mon now, give me credit for outlining the plot in two sentences, because sweet lord you need to write a paragraph to explain the surface of the plot. Overstuffed is an understatement, and that will always be The Wachowski's downfall with every film they produce. Their imagination takes over, as if a child was drawing a house and quickly turns it into a fire-breathing apple. Less is more, especially considering the constraints of a restricted runtime and budget. Visually impeccable, I will say that. The futuristic technology, regal architecture and explosive chaos looked majestic. But, when you recruit Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum as your two lead actors, expect chemistry thinner than hydrochloric acid. They were terrible! Munis looked confused all the time and Tatum lacked any emotion. Then we come to Redmayne as one of the antagonists. I...just feel sorry for him. He created life and most certainly destroyed it, as well as his acting credibility. The screenplay was atrocious. Injecting a forced romance amid dialogue that only acts as exposition and plot detailing. There's no time for character development, no time at all! Jupiter needs to ascend and save the cosmos or something. Not a galactic atrocity, but easily their weakest film."
" Sci/fi Fairytale
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,9,"I seem to be one of the very few people who loved this movie. The eternal oddball, that's me. 
I didn't like Mila Kunis much, to be honest. I never do. She's one of those actresses who wear the same face from the beginning to the end of amovie (in every movie), but I loved everything else. Visually, it must be one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. The costumes, the spaceships, the action scenes, the quirky little details, the photography... everything is magnificent.
Amazing: a love story in a sci-fi movie!
Amazing: eye candy for female viewers in a sci-fi movie! 
Amazing: Sean Bean makes it all the way to the end of the movie without being gruesomely slaughtered!
I am not in any way enthusiastic about royals and royalty and all that crap, but here it works the same way it works in traditional fairytales. The whole plot of the movie is very much a traditional fairytale, Cinderella becomes a princess, the three adversaries, etc... It may not work for some, but it does or me. 
Lots of secondary characters that stand out as truly interesting and memorable, unlike so many movies where one or two great characters float in a void of appalling acting.
I didn't know Eddie Redmayne before this movie and I know many ridiculed his performance here, but it made a perfectly convincing creepy villain for me.
It is a movie that has its own strange purity, and courage too, using traditional narrative shapes that don't belong to the genre, weaving them together with elements of fantasy and comedy and romance... I suppose it could not work in this cynical time. I am sorry that it did so badly because I would have loved to spend more time in this universe, in a sequel (or two). It is such a different and colourful take on Sci-fi, a genre in which so many movies, books and series are basically interchangeable."
" Not as bad as reviewers make it out to be.
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,6,"Sadly I fell for the bad reviews and bad press. Even the first time I tried to watch it I filtered it through the noise and didn't give it a chance at all. At $7.88 as a Channing Tatum and sci-fi fan I bought the blu-ray and gave it a chance. It's worth every penny of that. It's no Black Panther, but it's no Battlefield Earth either. It's more watchable than Dune, not as fun (or campy) as Starship Troopers, and either a low A or high B grade by my book. The story is no more or less complicated than other space operas. The pacing alternates well, and is above medium as a whole. Some scenes slow down but not as severe as some press stated.The special effects are pure Wachowski and fit the story. Bad special effects are exemplified by the almost 5 minute Enterprise fly by in 1979's Star Trek. There are many huge effects but they are not celebrated at the detriment of the story or pacing. Some have complained about trivia such as wings too small to support mass and I disagree with that sniping in general. We don't have gravity boots, dog men, bee Sean Beans, cannibalistic immortality potions or laser swords and nobody complains about those, so get over the wings. The character effects were better than most.The acting was well done. Eddie Redmayne was terrible in Fantastics Beasts. I wanted to scream look at the camera, look people in the eye! His being unrecognizable in this role is a compliment and Beasts may not have been his fault. His voice was less annoying than Bale's Batman but not a plus. I am not a Mila Kunis fan but she did well in this role. Sean Bean always lives up to his body of work and amazingly survived this film. At least the Wachowskis don't kill Starks when they get mad at fans. No one dominated like a Cumberbatch, Serkis, or Weaving but they all filled their roles. As a martial artist the fight scenes were as real as a dog man fighting a flying dinosaur could be. The attempt at realism versus CGI is evident. If you haven't, watch this. You may not buy it or rewatch it like a 14 year old in 1977 watching Star Wars, but it's worth any genre fan's time. For transparency I loved Valerian and am not a real fan of the last two Transformer's movies."
" Fun to watch
",2018-05-09 00:00:00,8,"SPOILER ALERT!
I've seen this movie 3 times spread over 3 years' time span and I still enjoy watching it. Great special effects, fun and original story about how human life on earth started (and may end) and the fun feeling of 'owning the planet'.
About the negative reviews: WHY would onyone want high standard 'character development' in a movie that is filld to the brim with great special effects and action? A bit silly is the typical American 'boy saves girl and gets her afterwards' theme but all the visual overload compensates this. Looking forward to seeing it a 4th time!"
" TO LIVE IS TO CONSUME
",2018-05-02 00:00:00,6,"Jupiter's dad was an astronomy buff and tagged her with the name ""Jupiter Jones"" (Mila Kunis) because ""Pluto Nash"" reeks of a ""B"" movie. Destined to clean toilets, Jupiter has no idea she has royal DNA, the cosmic Cinderella story. She is going to be the ""Queen Bee"" of the planet and look beautiful forever, except there are aliens who want her dead and also that enslavement thing. We find out a large corporate family owns the planet and wants to harvest the over populated planet of its human DNA, except for her who happens to have Royal DNA.Her prince is a man named Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) who has flying boots and wolf ears.I didn't see any thank yous in the credits to ""Star Odyssey"" the ""B"" Italian film from which the Wachowskis borrowed some of their plot: ""The planet is sold to an evil despot named Kress, who soon flies to ""Sol 3"" to start gathering humanoid slaves to sell to his evil counterparts.""Their films (Matrix) once again attempts to introduce ideas of ownership and enslaved masses for a higher class while using ugly creatures that looked like they came from ""Dark Crystal."" The film fell flat in entertainment as our main character was never developed beyond her DNA and occupation. The plot was laborious in making points interfering with the flow of the film.It could have been better scripted, directed, and edited.Guide: No f-bombs or sex. Partial butt nudity."
" Does not even deserve to be rated
",2018-05-01 00:00:00,1,"I saw the first 20 minutes and couldn't stop myself from laughing so hard. My sister and I mocked the whole movie, because it was so bad and we made up by making fun of the plot of the movie. Never in my entire life have I seen such a terrible cinema movie face the silver screen. People can make any junk now and call it a movie - I don't now what this was. Pls don't waste your precious time with this crap. Life is short.Read Harry Potter/watch Harry Potter movies instead - and wash this piece of garbage movie of your mind"
" Like a hidden rotten apple
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,4,"The movie has such good grafics and could've been a great one but hollywood did it again. The scipt is just the worst, trying to make a sciencefiction / action movie more apealing for women with love, drama and uncomfortable scenes of a ordinary life of a girl. With some extra gay scenes and afro american characters this would be perfecly PC. I wich they would go back to making movies for the story rather than making them for an audience."
" Good enjoyable sci film film - doesn't deserve the negative reviews!
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,10,"I don't get all the negative reviews for this film. It has action, decent acting, good sci fi effects and reasonable storyline. What I do see from some of the reviews is that some people appear to have lost the ability to just sit back and watch a film without constantly analysing and over analysing it. For goodness sake just watch a film for the fun of it! This is an enjoyable and very watchable film, I have watched it on repeats and don't bore of it, and the fact it has Channing Tatum in it is just the cherry on the top ;-)"
" 8th Time watching this movie, I will tell you why!.
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,10,"Yes it is a hot mess but only because there is so much going on! this is not for the faint of heart or slow thinkers! So you people that love Romantic Comedies do not judge this because it is not your cup of tea. Now to the real mess: The cast was very well picked! all the evil you can handle and one girl with a hero doing everything he can to write the wrongs into a right! I love this movie just because of the philosophy and that is why it did very, very, very well in CHINA! But it seems that someone paid some people to slap bad publicity to this movie because it came out along side other movies at the box office. Oligarchy of our country is saturated with thugs and mobsters with deep pockets controlling our entertainment and our industries thus why this movie tanked in the USA, Give this movie another chance and watch it completely! Do not miss a single moment because every second explains the next and the scenes are wrapped up so perfectly that you will figure out why they mentioned or combined certain takes. I commend the cast and crew of this movie! What a great writer! a great Producer and what a good director managing thousands of crew members to do this perfect movie! When you think about it I have seen near perfect graphics , sound and actors but terrible writing and cuts that I just gave 3 to 4 stars but this one did not lack any information! I am begging for a sequel because there are so many unanswered questions, like where is the base located that rebuilds catastrophes? I am also up in arms on the planets she owns! She supposedly owns the whole galaxy! And with the son dead she is in charge of all the production but chances are the other son and daughter is snatching it up and have become stuarts of her estate. The sequel will probably focus on us being cows for the slaughter again but this time the Son that died probably promised the whole earth would be processed to a large consortium of investors that will do anything to invade earth due to a contract that was made and not accomplished. So this would be very interesting what they will do and I hope the same writers are back on the sequel. Praying for this sequel that really needs to answer the questions we have from the last. Hopefully the second time around will grow an occult following that will then push for a orgin Story made into a TV show or cartoon. We can only hope."
" So much potential why not make 2 or 3 better films?
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,1,"There was enough multiple ideas to make a whole entire alternative universe and with good casting and character development it could be fun scary touching but they shoved it all ina film that is too long in the end. Lovely visuals costume design sets and some acting but i was really bored and felt like they wasted time, which was the whole point of the harvesting of humans just like scientology claims LOL. Too bad they didnt take a longer view and made 3 awesome well paced films...this failed for me. Aslo does the woman ha e to believe the last man she talks to like some female goodlookimg Trump PRESIDENT!?"
" Not Very Good.
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,2,"Went to see this with my friends who were hyped to view it. We ended up leaving halfway through out of anger to watch the 2015 Spongebob Movie instead. May I add that the Spongebob movie was about one hundred times more entertaining than this film. Not saying that the Spongebob movie was high art, we just got more enjoyment with our money. Would not recommend, even if it was free. Disappointing and lack-luster to say the least."
" Hope and Heroism in a Dystopian Setting - Nice Futuristic Gadgets
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,10,"This film has a unique way of illustrating the future and has a rather dystopian feel to it. This is the interesting part though, inside this dystopian reality, a tale of hope, courage and heroism unfolds. The special effects are amazing, the futuristic gadgets total fun, a hero and a girl add a romantic aspect to it and there are a lot of space fights. Some of the action scenes were too long for my taste, but the story was thoroughly entertaining and I wish there was a sequel. The whole atmosphere of the movie reminded me ""Thor: Rangarok"", probably due to the dystopian setting."
" Brilliant!
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,10,"Thought the chemistry between the 2 leads was amazing, I believed it.

" Retelling of a Cult Legend
",2018-01-24 00:00:00,9,"Godlike ancient aliens want to harvest all the humans on Earth to make space drugs and the hero of the tale save the planet, not with strength or intelligence but dumb luck and fetishistic sex appeal. It's an absurd story with fancy visuals. It also happens to be a retelling of the story of J.R. ""Bob"" Dobbs, the semi-divine figurehead of the church of the SubGenius.While aesthetically, Pierce Brosnan in 'Mars Attacks!' was much closer in appearance to ""Bob"", Mila Kunis's performance was much more in line with the personality and actions of ""Bob""; No clue what's going on through the whole story. Interestingly, much like Pierce Brosnsan's character falls for a half dog, half Sara Jessica Parker in 'Mars Attacks!', Mila Kunis's character falls for a half dog, half Channing Tatum in this film! I'm unaware of half dog, half human relations within Subgenius lore, so the connection is fascinating.There is even a lesson about ""Slack"" squeezed in at the end that only studious members of the terrible cult of the Subgenius might comprehend. Our savior returns to Earth and continues her life as a janitor scrubbing toilets, despite knowing that she is royalty at the intergalactic level. She has found inner peace (or is just not thinking), and presumably, gets to bang the half dog, half Channing Tatum."
" A good story if you can read between the lines
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,10,"While movies like ""Dunkirk"" or ""the last Jedi"" are get hyped up to the air and actually not being a 5 star at all , this movie is getting so many negative reviews even though its far better than the 2 i stated.""The Matrix"" was a great trilogy, for the most people because of the , to that time, state of the art SFX but what the movies really were saying was for the ones being into old occult histories, conspiracy theories and modern philosophers chasing the answer ""who i am, where i come from, why i am here, where i go"" if you were able to read between the lines...Same is to this movie. If you re more into the topic, beyond ""Ancient Aliens"", you really might get much more out of the movie than ""ridiculous fighting scenes of a man dog and a dude skating through the air""....honestly, is it more ridiculous than the figures in ""justice league"" or ""Avengers""? To me i have found this movie quite interesting, bit cheesy here and there, but definitely not a ""waste of time"". 10 stars? of course not, maybe a 6 or 7, but i give it a 10 just to give some credits back for such a underrated, entertaining movie with a thoughtful story."
" Don't be discouraged by the ratings here. It is a great film.
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,9,"I have known about this film for a while but I was not interested in seeing it due to the mostly low ratings it got. Zapping through my TV channels one day, I saw a part of it and it seemed ok. Therefore, I decided to read user reviews not just looking at the average rating. The I saw some people claiming it to be a good movei. Then, I decided to see it. I am very glad I did."
" The CGI is quite good, actually...
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,6,"...but that's all this movie has going for it...it is entertaining, in it's own way, but a virtually non-existent story drags the movie down from the beginning. A script would have been nice too, but apparently the actors were thrown in to sink or swim on their own...No, it does not have any coherent story line to hold onto...in fact, you'll find it very hard to understand at all...BUT, it does entertain, and that is what movies are supposed to do...So, give it a try. Believe it or not, the movie does have some stunning scenes in there..."
" Jumbled and Juvenile, yet Joyous for 10 year olds.
",2017-10-28 00:00:00,7,"Upon second watching, (with my daughters, this time) I realised this was basically a Children's film in disguise.My 10 and 8 year old loved it. They have watched it twice now and were rooting for the eponymous ""Jupe"" from start to finish. Although the bramble patch that doubled for a story kept my children asking questions all the way through...I mean, seriously... What the hell, Wachowskis? This was not your finest storytelling hour.From an Adult's standpoint, this film is a mess from start to finish... Whisking the viewer from stunning set-piece scene to stunning scene to a cottage in the countryside... To the centre of a maelstrom... Set against a grandiose and splendid background, the story comes across as irrevocably insipid and weak, all but overpowered by the looming shadows of the fabulously powerful galaxy the sisters created. Moreover, the ""plot"" moves on so quickly that the audience are unable to form connections with any of the characters or settings. Any characterisations that are there, are shallow and the outcome is pretty obvious from the get go.Which is a crying shame since the sumptuous, no expenses spared sets and clearly well thought out Galactic milieu were tantalising us with its beauty and implied depth... It was crystal clear that the sisters had worked hard on building a galaxy with a deep, sordid history far too long and far too out of control and crowded for comfort... A backdrop that would have been perfect for an epic story to be set in.Instead, I have to ask... to what purpose did they create this? It just seems such an egregious waste of resources and effort for a story so simple as to be second rate.I can honestly only assume it was initially meant to be series but then something went wrong and the entire first season was compressed into a 2 hour mashup of sadly missed potential. Like the single ""filmisode"" versions of Shogun and V in the 80's. Impossible and pointless.This easily had the opportunity of becoming something akin to Luc Besson's 5th Element or the rich tapestry of Star Wars or as I mentioned, a whole, new series.Instead we were offered a pedestrian plot with non stop, escalating fight scenes and a really cringeworthy ""love"" story... and a skating alien!!!My daughters really want to watch it again! I give it a seven for effort but broken down as below:Adult: ★★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆ Drunk Adult: ★★★★★★☆☆☆☆ Kids: ★★★★★★★★★☆☆"
" A surprisingly good film
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,9,"Though the film is confusing to begin one (and reason for losing 1 rating) when you get into it, it's a very good film. The beginning should explain more and give a short back story to the who's and why's. Because of the lack of, you find you'll spend the first 20 minutes head scratching and wondering what the hell is going on instead of enjoying the film.This will also put a lot of people off and no doubt has translated into such a low score.Here's hoping they do a directors cut and sort that issue out as this is definitely a film with sequels written all over it.Without ruining the film for anyone who hasn't yet seen it, if you enjoy sci-fi, along with a bit of romance, a lot of action and a few morals thrown in, you will enjoy this film.Acting, editing and directing are all top notch. Visually stunning though a few cgi moments does ruin the moment during a few scenes.Definitely deserves a second viewing (think The Matrix or Highlander and the ""uh?"" factor when you first saw them)"
" Surprisingly awesome!
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,9,"Not a massive fan of syfy myself but felt compelled to write this. I have read a few reviews on various sites about this movie and thought i'd give it a go. I read a previous review here that said a whole bunch of stuff about character development etc blah blah, however as i already stated, ""not a massive syfy fan"", i thought this movie was excellent!. If you are looking for the next Matrix or Alien or Riddick then this isn't for you. This is a movie ""type"" i remember from my youth, where the story makes the characters not the other way around. If you are old enough to remember Krull then you will know what i mean. Movies used to be all about the story and action, where the ""hero"" became the hero during the movie and not ""built up"" in pre-story character development (as did all other characters within the movie), basically the characters became part of the story and not the other way around. This is one of those movies. A breath of fresh air in my opinion. CGI loaded? yes. Good acting? more than good enough. Good story? most defo. If syfy is your thing and you just want to be entertained then this is ideal. Enjoy :)"
" When Jupiter Ascends, the Wachowskis descend.
",2017-09-20 00:00:00,4,"First off, this movie is not good. There is literally only one good thing about this movie. Some of the effects/action scenes are MEDIOCRE. Starting with the plot, Jupiter is a young woman/illegal alien from Russia who is apparently the reincarnation of a monarch that died AFTER she was born, or was it before? Oh well, not that I cared anyways. Basically after the bounty hunters were brought in from the monarchs children to find the mother's reincarnation, we meet Channing Tatum, who plays Cain Wise. A man who was an experiment by the government, and has dog-like senses, and yet, as proved at the end of the movie, it's revealed he once had wings? So they do some stuff, meet a guy, PROVE THAT BEES CAN SENSE ROYALTY EVEN IF IT IS A HUMAN REINCARNATION OF A LITERAL ALIEN, and meet two of the children. The daughter, reveals how they prolong their life, via special moisturizer, and the son reveals how this moisturizer is made, with humans, and not the dead kind. Basically the son tries to marry the reincarnation of his mother(just go along with it) and Caine and the guy we met from earlier stop the wedding because ""I love you"" and ""He's going to kill you after the wedding"". So they meet the second son, who has Jupiter's mean family and will let them go if Jupiter gives him Earth. So action scene #40 happens and creepo bro admits that HE KILLED THE MOTHER! (You get 5 extra points if A: you were genuinely surprised, or B: you still care) and he gets shot in the nuts two times. So the brother dies, Jupiter becomes queen of Earth, and I want to die. So yes, it is that bad."
" The Watchowskis' Descending
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,4,"Jupiter's Ascending is 2015's Battlefield Earth.Yes,It's that bad.What surprises me is that the directors of this film(The Watcowski brothers) are the same people that made the Matrix!The film has a a lot of problems.The plot is ridiculous,dumb and feels like a 12 year old came up with it.The dialogue is also aggressively stupid.If you thought that the main character Jupiter will be the next great female lead in Sci Fi you were wrong because she is underdeveloped(as every character in the film) and spends most of the film cleaning toilets and being saved by others.The film was also packed with awful performances by actors that are usually good like Channing Tatum,Sean Bean and an extremely bad performance by Academy Award Winner Eddie Redmayne.Worth mentioning are the bad visuals despite the fact that the movie's budget is 170 million dollars.Usually I don't like to say only bad things about movie's and I try to find quality points in them but this film has nothing to enjoy except that it is so bad that it is kinda hilarious."
" Fun popcorn flick with great action sequences and a surprising ability to anger people
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,8,"Having been enjoying the Wachowski's Sense8, I thought I would check out some of the movies of theirs that I'd missed. And so, I sat down to watch Jupiter Ascending knowing nothing beyond that it was considered a turkey.I enjoyed it terrifically. The film involves a cleaning lady who finds herself in the midst of a feud among extra terrestrial schemers.The movie is most notable for its excellently-filmed action scenes, such as a wonderful chase sequence involving alien jet fighters and anti-gravity boots. The movie is also visually lush and imaginative, as in a gorgeous wedding scene.The story is nothing original, but it serves as a decent framework for the action, with Mila Kunis appealing as a young woman out of her depth and Channing Tatum making a satisfying action hero. Of particular note is Sean Bean as Tatum's ex-commander. Truthfully, when I saw him I thought he probably should have been cast in Tatum's role, but to be fair, he's too old to be a persuasive love interest (at least in this century).The most surprising thing about the movie, especially after watching Sense8, is how it falls into the white-people-in-outer-space genre. The movie is hugely conventional, as though the Wachowski's hoped that by embracing every convention of blockbusters they could have one. Women are meek, black people are mercenaries or officious bureaucrats, and the main bad guy seems a little gay.Now on to the critics...I was really surprised after watching the movie to see how many people hate it, and even after reading a number of reviews, I still don't get it. So I want to explain where I differ with those critics.""The plot was too convoluted and confusing"": No, it wasn't. Any question I see raised I can either answer or can say it's not germane (someone asked who rebuilt Chicago, for example, but I think ""the all-powerful people with their advanced technology and their many minions"" is plenty of answer). It's basically a palace intrigue story, and as those go it's quite straightforward. I'm confused by the confusion.""Kunis does dumb stuff"": Yes, the young housekeeper who never, I would guess, went to college, sometimes makes sub-optimal decisions while dealing with an elaborate empire she has no information about. I think that's pretty realistic. I think the most unrealistic thing is the smartest thing she does, which is knowing arcane royal codes. How did *that* happen?I suspect most critics of her actions would do no better. And I'm okay with a movie that shows how actual human beings would act in extraordinary circumstances (i.e., overwhelmed and unsure what to do).""The actors were terrible"": I liked Kunis in this and feel she's being underrated (one reviewer, who apparently hadn't seen Black Swan, said she shouldn't do drama). I liked Tatum as well. I thought their chemistry was pretty good. When he was carrying her here and there I felt like they wanted to kiss, so chemistry.As for Eddie Redmayne, I don't get the hate. He wasn't especially memorable, I'll admit, but he was fine.In conclusion: As another reviewer said here, ""what did you people expect?"" This is a light, Star-Wars-inspired action flick that makes no attempt at the profundity that corrosively ate away at the Matrix trilogy. It's just fun. Lighten up.Anyway, I've come to the conclusion that reviews of Wachowski films cannot be trusted. So I'm going to go ahead now and watch Speed Racer now."
" generic story in spectacular visual effect, Jupiter Jones ???
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,6,"The idea that planets are harvested for live-force, wasn't that Stargate: Atlantis? But the plot is rather sketchy, characters are not developing much. Visuals of the movie are pretty awesome though. I think they have one of the most beautiful wormholes I've seen, also the cities and dresses of the nobility are most charming. So in a way, this movie is like the Pacific Rim. Some generic story, and awesome visuals, and magic boots (instead of giant robots).And then there are the generic clichés - the girl cleans toilets, joke about DMV when doing intergalactic bureaucracy, girl and hero fall in love, blah-blah.But my biggest issue with this movie is: JUPITER JONES IS A BOY ! (friend of Bob and Peter). If you want to name the girl Jupiter for whatever plot purposes, at least use different surname than Jones. Now every time they say the name, I imagine the Other Jupiter in that situation (particularly wrong during the wedding...)"

Definitely not. Is it the Matrix? Absolutely not. Will The Wachowskis ever top the Matrix or even equal it? I seriously doubt it. With all that in mind, give the movie a chance. I think you'll at least be entertained for a couple of hours."
" Unfairly judged
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,8,"Fun movie, great cgi, visually stunning. Creates a world you wish we could see more of. I think the bad reviews are mainly people who wanted the matrix 4. This is not the matrix 4. When you compare it to the movies that come out now it is a masterpiece. I mean like other fantasy movies. Like all the comic book movies they are making that are total garbage and that make absolutely no sense. Every one of them has a plot that is only furthered by the protagonists stupidity and bad acting. Jupiter Ascending is a missed gem."
" Glorious CGI mess..
",2017-07-19 00:00:00,1,"I honestly didn't even know that this was directed by the Wachowski brothers (or ""sisters"" lol, whatever) until the credits rolled up. This was a mess worse than Matrix Reloaded and I'm pretty sure at this point Wachowski's have forgotten how to make a movie without throwing in CGI at every corner.CGI was EVERYWHERE and so overdone that you just stop caring about anything happening because it all looks fake. The combat is done mostly with CGI characters with SFX thrown everywhere on-screen, so get ready to spend time trying to figure out WTF is actually going on. I like how they had to mask CGI characters by throwing in blurry camera-work and motion blur in every scene. Most scenes in-fact, look like a video game capture with mindless shooting and explosions. Most of the alien world is CGI, which would be OK except in this movie, the worlds are some of THE most generic alien worlds ever. I've seen artists create better concept art for alien worlds on DeviantArt than this movie. Every alien world is mixed with same post-processing paint-job making them look almost similar (yellow, after Matrix's green and blue, Wachowski's favorite color for sci-fi is yellow now).Forget CGI, the plot and characters are a bigger mess. Mila Kunis is probably THE worst choice for her role.. actually no, Tatum was THE worst choice for HIS role (tbh I was more busy laughing at his pink lipstick). No idea why Sean Bean is even there, he's way too better for this crap-fest. To make it worse, most of the dialogue is blended in with loud music. Apparently Wachowski brothers still don't know how to balance sound in their movies. Alien words and worlds thrown in, while everything else is so.. human. Nothing alien about these people.The laughably bad CGI aliens or costumes for aliens were worse than newer Star Wars movie where everything looks fake.What a mess, I can't even be arsed to go into detail with the review, it was THAT bad."
" too much for one film
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,7,"good film, cast.i just felt it was too much for one film it felt rushed. if you like si-fi with attractive actors and no story arc then this is the film for you. the acting is decent with a-list talent but the overall story fells like another generic 21st century film trying to to find an audiences."
" A Hot Mess
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,4,"Its a shame this movie is a hot mess because the basic story idea is an interesting one. The character arc for Kunis' Jupiter doesn't work. She's goes from cleaning toilets to falling from skyscrapers to debating intergalactic politics with barely a gasp. She's the movie's eye candy and then they dress her in a long sleeve plaid shirt. The 'good guy's' heroism is nothing more than 'I can drive my spaceship really fast through the bad guys'. The DMV queen sequence is the middle of the movie is too farcical and cartoonish, it falls flat. There were some good ideas but the execution and direction doomed this movie to failure. Oh, and Mila Kunis can't act."
" Entertaining and good special effects
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movie for the second time today, and I was impressed with the special effects. The story wasn't fully well explained so I imagine there was a plan for a second movie. but I enjoyed the movie and the characters were quite interesting. would have loved to see more of their story lines."
" Awesome SciFi Film - Worthy of Cult Classic
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,9,"Jupiter Ascending explores the value of time to each of us through the eyes of the narrator/heroine, Jupiter Jones, and the various characters she encounters, from her family, to her kidnappers, to the space royalty that invade earth to manipulate her influence on their management of the commercialization of selling substances to prolong lifei.e. extend time. The Wachowskis have created a gem of a film with layer upon layer of textures, if you take the 'time' to see them. They are easy to miss, as apparently many have. Jupiter Ascending drew me in with the spectacular worlds and visual feast of exploding action. Already a fan of Channing Tatum, Sean Bean and Eddie Redmayne, I now add Milas Kunis to my list and many other character actors because of this film. I don't mind Redmayne's over the top version of Belam. The latter's a royal who is more full of himself than any one on earth. Affect in speech accentuates his self-aggrandizement. That reveals more about Belam than Eddie. Give Eddie the credit for knowing what he is doing; Lily and Lana, too. I chuckle at the reviews that disparage this film, because all I hear when I read them, is that they missed many aspects of it. The start of the film foreshadows the theme: the question is how do you spend your time and do you appreciate the time you have? Staring at stars through a telescope, the father spends his time on his passion and with the love of his life, which produces the child—who becomes the reincarnation—or recurrence, as they call it, of the mother of a royal family vying for the greatest resource in the 'verse' or universe: time. They live for thousands of years by 'harvesting' humans and bathing in the extract, thus expanding their 'time' indefinitely. Time is more valuable than gold or anything we have on earth. We don't value it because we don't think we can trade it, like we can gold. But the Wachowskis are going to show us differently. Early on we see Jupiter Jones despising her life and every moment—time— of every day. She is kidnapped by the three heirs respectively. They use our hero Caine Wise (Tatum) who joins forces with Stinger (Sean Bean) to save Jupiter again and again. The relationship between the men alternates between fighting their old personal battles, rejuvenating their long-time friendship and healing a betrayal. The initial attraction between Caine and Jupiter is strained shortly after they meet because of the extreme differences between stations of royalty and 'lycantant-splices.' If the Wachowski sisters failed here, it was that they didn't make the case that Caine has no standing in the order of things. We don't sense that Jupiter would have any resistance in falling for Caine because Jupiter really doesn't care about being royalty. She can more easily convince Caine who puts up little in resisting Jupiter. But that is really minor. Overall, I loved the flying and the fight scenes. I work-out to them and find my footsteps and heart rate always increase with them easily— Thank you, Lana and Lily! You rock, just as you did in the Matrix! Unlike so many of the complainers, I have watched this again and again. Each time I watch it, I notice nuances I missed before. As with all of the Wachowski works, they have so many layers, there are more things to look forward to. The potential for more stories are endless. I hope they will write many more stories from these worlds. And I haven't got to the tertiary characters etc. Captain Diomika Tsing (Nikki Amukka-Bird) commands not only the space ship, but the screen with her presence. Look forward to more of her in future work by the Wachowskis. Bird brings women of color and gives them authority and assertiveness without being nasty. She rocks. Advocate Bob (brilliantly played by Samuel Barnett—MUST see more of him) and the Bureaucrats (John Locke, Sarah Crowden) are laugh out loud funny. I adore Advocate Bob's chipper excitement and progressive frustration with the process of the paperwork. The 'Be thankful the Time spent at the DMV is not worse theme' is clearly stated by Jupiter. Bob makes it hilarious. The end of the film brings the theme to its conclusion—not with the happily ever after moment, but with the growth of Jupiter Jones, who started out hating her life, and ends appreciating every moment—even cleaning toilets for the rich and making coffee and fixing breakfast for her mom and aunt. When the family gathers, they present Jupiter with a telescope, showing that they have grown—no longer seeing her as a girl only meant to marry but as someone, whose interests have merit. Jupiter's life has changed. She owns the earth, but she has opted for its change to be incremental. She is taking her time to enjoy it. Time again. After all time flies when you are having fun, just as she is flying with Caine at the end. Time and fun are joined together in flight. The Wachowskis are brilliant. No surprise that many can't see it or the many layers. The layers are blessed with Michael Giacchino's music. He is one of this century geniuses when it comes to music scores. He matches the drama and the humor, every ebb and flow. If I could write screenplays, I would want him scoring all my work. IMO, If you take the time to watch it and absorb the nuance, you too can enjoy it. It's going to be a cult classic."
" Painful and that is it.
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,1,"I will start my review by saying one thing...DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! I know it looks really great and it was made by the Wachowski Brothers and they made The Matrix which was one of the best sci fi films ever made. Sadly though after making a movie going in the territory of Terminator 2 and other great sci fi films they have slipped into Battlefield Earth territory. Okay maybe this movie is not as bad as Battlefield Earth but it is almost as unwatchable. This movie didn't just bore me with uninteresting characters and a too multi-layered plot but it angered me with its sense of not wanting to be original in any way. Some of the aspects of films it ripped off were so noticeable that I think the directors just copied those aspects. Sometimes these aspects were major parts of the movie and that easily could annoy anyone who loved the movies they ripped. Anyway originality or not aside the film is also very poorly acted by Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum and(I am not joking here) EDDIE REDMAYNE of all Oscar winners. The characters are boring and uninteresting and it doesn't help that the movie doesn't really seem to be trying to make it interesting. The plot is mixed and at times in some way repetitive and hard to follow. The concepts were sometimes in a way promising but never delivered anything interesting. I also felt that Mila Kunis's character, Jupiter Jones(Yes that is her name), was very weak and always needed saving. Overall Jupiter Ascending is probably one of the worst sci fi films ever for being not original, terribly written and lazily acted which easily gives it a 1/4."
" So bad it's good or just plain bad?
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,5,"At this point no one will be going into this movie thinking they're seeing anything spectacular. Most, like I did, will go in wanting to just enjoy a few hours of crazy,stupid nonsense for a bit of a laugh. But does it live up to the 'so bad it's good' status? On balance, I think so.Now I watched this with a few drinks in me so my recollection of the already incomprehensible plot is not the best so I won't recount it here. All I really remember at this point are lots of overly long and over-the-top action sequences, painstakingly bad exposition and 'funny' dialogue and the campest overperformance of the century by one Eddie Redmayne. He really is the star of this dumpster fire and I laughed hard every time he and his jelly like lip movements came on screen.Overall, I did enjoy it for all the wrong reasons, as I'd been hoping, and still maintain that while the Wachowski's don't always make 'good' stuff, it's almost always entertaining in some way. This is true junk food and is the sort of thing to watch when you really want to just check out for an evening. As such, it's hard to give it a fair rating; just know what to expect going in and you'll enjoy it for the sheer ridiculousness it pumps into your eyeballs."
" Women, give this a try. Guys, stay away.
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,10,"Is this a cheesy action movie? Sure! But it's gorgeous, fun, has beautiful men competing for a female protagonist, and wth shouldn't women have the same fun men have had with pretty much every guy flick I've had to sit through during my long life?Tell me about how Conan, the Bond films, and pretty much every action film ever made before I got too damn bored to watch them were intellectual and film making masterpieces. Right.....Guys appear to hate this movie apparently because it caters to women. They hate it the way they hate teen girls having fun on their cell phones, or a host of other activities involving women enjoying themselves without men. Any media that women love that is just entertaining, will be instantly put down in our culture.If you'd like a glittering, lovely interstellar romp, get ready to watch, and just don't think too hard about the plot. Enjoy!"
" It's like the kid with unrealized potential who burns out turns to a life of drugs...
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,4,"This movie has the same problem that David Lynch's Dune had: great actors and directors with a great backdrop reading a so-so script cut into pieces by the producers needed to trim time and a studio wanting a fast buck. The Wachowski's are great directors, but the scope of what they were trying to achieve here is too big for just two hours.If they had given this a full 5 seasons in a television series to run its course with a limited budget and less well-known cast, I think we could have had another Babylon 5-like success. Instead we got this movie, which in spite of all the boundless potential that this story could have offered, decided to flame out in explosive, Jovian glory.So, why the 4 out of 10? The actors were decent in spite of it all, and while this movie is terrible, I actually want to see this universe fleshed out in a reboot or re-imagining of this story.On a side note, stop creating spaceships with multiple, exposed and intricate moving parts. It might look pretty to a graphic designer, but to the engineer it's stupid in the highest order. The fewer moving parts, the less-likely it would be to break down, be damaged, or experience performance drop off. These new spaceships would fall out of the sky in a matter of minutes."
" The queen is scrubbing toilets
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,4,"Who would have thought that the monarch of earth is a poor immigrant from the Ukraine in the USA barely getting by as a maid and scrubbing toilets of the rich and richer. Yet a whole lot of aliens are interested in match stick girl Mila Kunis because she's got royal DNA.It turns out that a whole lot of aliens and they're God-like creatures compared to where we are on the evolutionary scale. One of those interested in here is futuristic space soldier Channing Tatum who has none of those wolf like tendencies though he is part wolf. But not the pejorative kind of wolf, Mila has royal DNA and he treats her as the princess she is. He's also got himself a pair of magic boots that enable him to fly just like Superman.During the course of Jupiter Ascending we learn about the earth's greater history including what happened to the dinosaurs and what could happen if an unscrupulous family gets a hold of the Earth. One of them, Douglas Booth an outer space Snidely Whiplash almost marries Kunis.This film has pretensions to be Star Wars, but it reminds me more of that classic episode from Married With Children where little green aliens come to steal Al Bundy's socks.And in the end when the good guys win I kind of think that Mila Kunis might as Queen of the Earth would have exercised a few more royal prerogatives than she did."
" Flash Gordon meets Dune
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,7,"Enjoyable but forgettable. Won't become a cult or a classic. The storyline is a little bit convoluted and difficult to follow at times. The visual effects are impressive though.Worth watching, but probably not worth adding it to the bluray collection."
" Really impressive
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,8,"The quality of the effects was awesome, i actually enjoyed the whole movie, never was i not entertained. To be honest i preferred this to some recent star war movie.I am so surprised that this hasn't rated any better, rent it, if you are a sci-fi buff you will certainly enjoy it!"
" Confusing Garbage
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,2,"I gave this time simply because of some of The Wachowskis previous efforts but this for me is the final nail in their coffin as credible filmmakers. How you could look at this and say ""yeah we've done well there"" is beyond me. The Matrix was good and V for Vendetta likewise but those apart... nothing. So Jupiter Ascending, where to begin.... pure style over substance, poor characters, terrible story arc that makes little to no sense on occasion, poor acting (Redmayne is possibly the worst culprit and his voice is just ridiculous) which is disappointing given some of the talent on offer here. Even the makeup and effects look poor. For some reason Tatum looks like a cross between Legolas and Metallica singer James Hetfield?!? It only avoids a 1 star review through benefit of some vaguely attractive cinematography. I will rarely bale out of a film halfway through but came very very close. If you want earth people out and confused in space then just watch Guardians of The Galaxy and leave this where it belongs."
" The Wachowskis continue their descent into cinematic irrelevance
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,3,"JUPITER ASCENDING sees the Wachoski siblings continuing their descent into cinematic irrelevance following SPEED RACER and CLOUD ATLAS; the latter of those wasn't too awful, just bland, while SPEED RACER was astonishingly bad. JUPITER ASCENDING falls somewhere between those two definitions; it's a sprawling would-be science fiction epic chock-full of trite dialogue and clichéd characters who seem to think they're in STAR WARS or something.There are two main problems with the production. The writing is choppy and messy, with characters feeling bland and weak, no more than one-dimensional in the case of the consistently overrated Channing Tatum. The direction is very poor, particularly so in the endless action sequences, filled with CGI effects that do nothing for the viewer, and shot in a shaky, badly-edited fashion so that it's difficult to make out what you're supposed to be seeing. Mila Kunis is an unlikeable and unsympathetic lead and Eddie Redmayne makes for a ham-fisted villain. The only one who comes out of this with his head held high is the reliable Sean Bean, and even he doesn't have that much screen time."
" The worst ... possible spoilers
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,1,"I really only half watched this while playing games on my phone, but what I did see was no good. First off, there is just too much going. Way too many different styles for Sci Fi. The story line is out of control. One minute things are one way and then they fly off in to something else. I stayed confused up until the very end when all of sudden ... wings. Where the hell did they come from. It was free on the Syfy channel. I spent most of what I did see, laughing because it was just too absurd. I would not recommend this unless you are maybe high or drunk, because that's apparently what the writers were when they thought this was a good idea."
" Good entertainment
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,8,"Some people just don't like Channing Tatum. That being said, negative's will fall behind anything he does. The movies was appealing both visually and story line was decent. It's a sci-fi for g sakes! If you want insight into the universe and the answer on how to truly recycle plastic bags and save earth, this movie is not for you. If you are looking for some action packed fun, it's your ticket!"
" Awesome movie: Humanity is Family!
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,10,"This movie is about family. It's Lassie in space. It's about hope for our world, in that someone cares enough about the goodness of humanity on earth to save it. It's about limitless possibilities, wealth beyond imagining, and how love conquers all. Consider the vastness of the Universe, consider all the unknowns. Consider one day an immensely powerful space-faring race decides our fate. Are we merely a resource to be harvested or are we more. It will be the Jupiter Jones-types who will show them we're worth saving with family values, love, care, empathy and selflessness. If all they see in us are the nasty, greedy, selfish tyrant trolls who rape the earth and subjugate others for the almighty dollar, we're as good as scorched. Dig deep my friends into your own humanity, find wonder, verisimilitude and splendor in all you see, whether they are insightful bumblebees or a werewolf with wings -- this is a much better movie than haters make it out to be.Now all we need is a sequel."
" Jupiter is safe. Language unknown.
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,10,Jupiter was in the presents of Catherine when she had visitors. Jupiter really received her telescope from her mother. She did not have to explain where the telescope came from. Jupiter is really good. Caterine wrote her own name and the view of Jupiter was a hologram. Jupiter was and is justified as a good daughter of her mother. Jupiter is safe.
" Really, really not recommended
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,2,"One of the dumbest movies I have seen this year(2017). I borrowed this DVD from my local library. I am glad I did not spend any money to view this ridiculous, confusing sci-fiction(hope this is not insulting s/f fans). The best were the different 'species' of people in the film. The ideas of these different people is very creative. The make-up must have taken hours to apply. Finally, Jupiter/Mila is the most beautiful toilet bowl cleaner I have ever seen. Full make-up on her eyes: eye shadow, liner, and lashes. The whole shebang. She wakes up and you next see her fully made. They showed her cleaning the toilets in a least 3 scenes. Mila never cleaned a bowl in her life! Skip this."
" Like Star Wars. Visually spectacular. Mostly humorous. Mostly harmless and shallow.
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,7,"Plenty of stuff to keep my eyes busy. Ridiculous aliens out of nowhere or androids or whatever doing things that are 'funny'. Story is as light as a puddle, like an easy-going ride. Visually stunning space stuff. Minimal real character development or drama, a sequence of faintly amusing space-y fun things.This is like Star Wars. But I like this better. Less pretension. Or baggage. Better special effects. Actually, funnily enough, also a more convincing and well developed plot. It's about finding resources, not blowing up whatever Death Star it is this time. Sorry if that sentence was too long. Bye."
" Loved it
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,10,I truly loved this movie. I enjoy all times of movies from sci-fi to musicals but I have to say that this one was awesome. The characters were truly great and the attention to detail was mind blowing. I loved the new twist on the Caine's character since I like watching werewolf movies and one of my favorite animals is a wolf. The more subtle way they had him made is great. I really did like all of the characters and how they do mimic the animals they have been fashioned after. I do hope that they are able to make a sequel to continue the story.
" Doesn't deserve...
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,8,"...the hate. Had a lot of neat things going on, had a bunch of sci fi that we'd all like to see in our lifetimes...and Mila Kunis. Watched it 4 times now, really wish they'd do a sequel...but I know the money's not there. It's a good, fun flick. There are a lot that aren't. HAHA, and now I have to add a line or my review's not worthy. Gotta love IMDb. Anyone think they're gonna bring the message boards back?"
" I fell asleep
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,4,"The only reason I watched this film was because I'm a big fan of Channing Tatum. Well this was one of his worst performances ever. Channing Tatum wearing eyeliner, he looked like a bad Derek Zoolander! Mila Kumis is also one of my favorite actresses but in this film she lacked character and like in most of her films she is always serious and always has the same facial expressions. The whole story was silly and I fell asleep. Too much over dramatic music and of course Tatum always being a hero. Really disappointed in this film!"
" Seriously underrated cosmic fairy tale
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,8,"Putting a space opera on the screen is a very difficult task. Usually, a space opera involves many worlds, a lot of exotic characters with complicated backstories and a number of plots and subplots with a significant amount of pages dedicated to world building. A typical space opera is more than 1000 pages long and one fantasy analogue - the Lord of the Rings took 3 3-hour long movies to be recreated properly. The Wachowskis sisters made 1 2-hours long movie which is complete in itself (even though I certainly would love to see a continuation). To do that, they chose to dismiss a great deal of scientific realism, dialogue complexity and character development. And they decided to bet a lot on visual richness and emotional straight-forwardness. Which totally worked for me. It is a truly entertaining story of modern Cinderella sucked in a galactic battle for power and well, more time. The movie combines conspiracy theories, romance and sci-fi. It has a very decent story line, a lot of impressive (even if not very realistic) action scenes and in the end, it even leaves a positive message to the viewer. It does everything a space opera is supposed to do in the 2 hours it plays. For me this movie was seriously underrated and fell victim to a negative campaign led by people who were unprepared for the specifics of the genre. Space opera is not hard-core science fiction, it just has different premises. And the fact that it made 90% of its money outside of the USA and that it is constantly rotated on HBO demonstrates just how liked this movies is outside of the USA. And I'm extremely fed up with critics saying it failed to deliver. Failed to deliver what? It is fun, it has original story (something very rare nowadays), decent acting, great visuals and music, it has no blood and gore and its cruelty levels are in the range of what was considered normal before ""Game of Thrones"" numbed our senses. It is a good movie told a bit as a sparkling fairy tale. On the negative side: I really wish the science in the movie was better thought of. Especially the part on Earth. In space, you can easily believe any unrealistic activities are due to technology upgrades or genetic mutations/splicing/whatever. But on Earth, there are no excuses. And some goofs are really annoying and shouldn't be allowed by serious script writers. Also, I'd love more character depth, just for the pinch of salt in the chocolate."
" Weak plot and character development but VERY GOOD CGI! worth to watch.
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,5,"I have watched this movie knowing that I will not be surprised by a creative PLOT or narrative twist. This is really solid blockbuster that it is fun to watch while eating ice-cream at your house.The action scenes were great but on top of all the CGI was perfect!!!It is a shame that having some good actors they didn't achieve a good character development, perhaps the intention was to have them as a hook to watch the movie and that's all.The ending was abrupt and with an open door for a sequel. IF there is such I would wait till it get released in DVD and will watch it with high expectations from a technical standpoint.I am an editor and I really seek looking at this movies for getting inspired."
" Fantastic and Refreshing
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,10,"This movie from the start was a new take on the already worn out science fiction genre of movies that is sweeping Hollywood. From the start where we find out this ancient race of people harvest other fellow human beings that are far less advanced then they are and then all the way to the point to where we learn they live forever and only die from acts of violence; we really learn how unique this movie plot is. The part i liked most about the movie is the path that it took with earth, learning that we earthlings actually have a queen and she decided to live her normal life and not let the rest of our species learn that there was in fact an advanced race throughout the entire galaxy. I thought this was a fantastic movie and hope to see a second movie in this series. Also the acting in this movie was amazing."
" Poopiter Descending
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,3,"Absolutely horrendous movie! Such a waste of talent. This movie could've been so much more: the ideas and concepts were really interesting and cool, but either the editing, directing, writing, perhaps all three were completely lacking. The concepts and ideas also play a part in the movie's downfall; there was just too much going on for any of it to really work together to form a coherent whole. The movie was good in parts but it suffered from a lack of cohesion and the need to make sense. The characters were flat and one-dimensional; I guess that's just how Channing Tatum is as per usual, so no change there, but Mila Kunis looks bored and almost embarrassed that she's a part of this movie. No wonder it bombed."
