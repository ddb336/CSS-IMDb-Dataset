" Good but could have been much better
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,6,"The movie explores an interesting piece of history which sits on a potentially thrilling story but unfortunately the final product slyly drifts toward hero worhsip trend of Indian movies rather than making the story talk. The screenplay focuses too much on Akshay Kumar and even neglects the potential struggles faced by an extraction seeking group.1 - 5 July, 20"

" Must watch ...
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,10,You love this movie if u love mankind stories. How a person help his community in other countrie.
" Hats off to an Actor i couldn't once stand!
",2017-10-23 00:00:00,9,"Akshay Kumar is some one i used to laugh at, and not because of his comedy.. Through the 90s when he was popular, he summed up bad acting and bad taste,. In the noughties he became a comedian and even more popular, still couldn't stand him, felt his comedy was crass and contrived. And then god knows what happened, he suddenly started consistently giving good movies and good performances.. I was left speechless at his work in Airlift along with Rustom and Baby.. What a turnaround.. Respect. Great, Great Movie."
" Airlift (a real based movie)
",2017-05-16 00:00:00,8,"Airlift is a movie based on a real life conflict and bloodshed that took place 25 years back in Kuwait...Akshay Kumar's gritty acting is really mesmerizing. This movie is perfect for classy movie lovers who like this type of patriotic movie Unlike other movies, the songs of this movie are soothing and full of melody. Overall Airlift is a good movie, solidly plotted,well executed & well acted. Go with your friends family & watch Airlift U guys surely feel proud to be an Indian after watching this movie."
" Reminds me of Hotel Rwanda
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,8,"It reminds me of Hotel Rwanda, a story that must be told. The story Is good and true and the actors (you almost never hear about them up north in Europe) does a fine job.But the man known as ""george"" how can behave like a snob when he should be happy to get home?"
" Hollywood could learn from Bollywood
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,10,"First I will state that I am not Indian.This is the third Bollywood movie I've watched in as many weeks. Every one of them has been leaps and bounds better than the nonsense we are fed by Hollywood. Every aspect of these movies is better, from the writing, the character building, the passionate acting, and the top notch musical scores. All the technical qualities and filmography are first rate as well.Airlift was no exception. The story was engaging, the characters inspiring, and the acting impeccable. The only slight knock, which is not even a knock in my opinion was that the spectacular multi-million dollar special effects you would expect to see in a Hollywood version of the opening scenes were a bit underwhelming. That said, I would trade these any day for the great story I got from the rest of the film.Bollywood movies seem more in touch with humanity than products from Hollywood. Whereas Hollywood movies often leave you feeling that humanity is failing, movies like Airlift, Dear Zindagi, and others reconnect you with the best part of ourselves and show us that there is hope for us.I'm becoming a real Bollywood fan. I also love how these films are often spoken partially in Hindi and often more than half in English, so I am able to enjoy the film without spending too much time reading the subtitles.America, watch this film; you will not be disappointed."
" Melodramatic turkey
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,1,"In 1990 Kuwait, Indian businessman Ranjit Katyal (Akshay Kumar) is a fictional character based on the real-life events of Mathunny Mathews. Ranjit is a successful Kuwait-based businessman who is very well-connected in Kuwait and Iraq, and makes a happy home with his wife Amrita (Nimrat Kaur) and little daughter Simu. He calls himself a Kuwaiti and is often derisive towards Indians.After a night of partying, Ranjit is woken up to a phone call from his friend and receives word that negotiations between Iraq and Kuwait have collapsed, and Iraqi troops have begun their advance on Kuwait. Iraq owes a large debt to Kuwait after the Iran-Iraq war and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq had urged Kuwait during earlier talks to reduce their oil supply so prices can rise in the market and Iraq can stabilize their economy. When Kuwait refused, and began slant-drilling into Iraqi oil fields, Saddam ordered the attack. That morning, Ranjit discovers that Kuwait is now mostly overrun by Iraqi soldiers. Ranjit and Nair, his driver, go out and drive to the Indian embassy in an attempt to take their family and leave Kuwait. They are eventually stopped by Iraqi soldiers at a checkpoint and Nair is shot dead amidst the confusion. A shocked Ranjit is then taken to the Emir's palace. There he meets Iraqi Republican Guard officer Major Khalaf bin Zayd (Inaamulhaq), who reveals that he was the one who pulled up to the checkpoint earlier and prevented Ranjit from any harm. Major Khalaf, who knows Ranjit from Ranjit's visits to Iraq, chides him but extends his personal friendship, ensuring Ranjit and his family's safety from the soldiers.From there, Ranjit goes to the Indian embassy where he learns that the Kuwaiti government has fled. The some 170,000 Indians in Kuwait are now stranded as refugees. Iraqi forces continue to push through Kuwait and eventually Ranjit's mansion is broken into, but his wife and child manage to escape to his office. Ranjit convinces his friends to work together, and they set up a makeshift camp for some 500 Indians with Major Khalaf's permission. Amrita urges Ranjit to use his leverage to extricate his own family but Ranjit, who ordinarily would have just looked out for himself, appears to have a change of heart. He decides to stay and help the other Indians get out of Kuwait."
" Hate subtitles......but
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,10,"This was an excellent movie and i really don't care to read subtitles but this movie just kept my attention and before i knew it the movie was over,This is a very timely movie right now, as my country a beacon of freedom and hope for refugees has been forced to turn her back on refugees facing much worse than these folks caught in Kuwait,because of a scared and hateful segment of our population who voted for a disgusting man{CHEETO}.Recommend the haters who are blocking refugees to our country watch this movie and maybe it will soften their hearts."
