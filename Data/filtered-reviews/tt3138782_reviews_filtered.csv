" Beautifully Shot, Good Acting, BUT Plot Loopholes Abound
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,6,"The first thing that captures the viewers would be the colourful and beautifully shot scenes of both the mountainside and small towns, including both the interiors and exteriors of buildings.Acting was good albeit somewhat exaggerated in parts. By and large the entire cast did a good job and acted mostly believably and naturally.The main drawback of this movie is the half-baked script with inexplicable plot loopholes, and unconvincing turn of events, bordering on the absurd.Worst of all is the ridiculously, sappy and nonsensical ending which in seconds made laughable rubbish of the entire movie. It all but brought the entire effort into 'absurd-land' hook-line-and-sinker. What a shame.If as much attention had been paid to the script and believability of the plot and events, as had been to the cinematography, this would have been an excellent movie.The follow-up movie (which I don't know yet if I'd want to bother with) is supposed to 'explain' the ending absurdity. But the only way to explain mushy absurdity is with more mushy absurdity.Just too bad those involved were well capable of the sugary but not the substance."

Mostly I try to watch movie based on true story. I read a lot about this movie. But watch finally the movie recently. It was really to good experience for me to watch this kind of movie. A man who are willing to work as teacher and take initiative to build a school in a remote village. And then the story is just began. There are so many strong message available in this movie. Disable people one of our family member, so we need to behave with them like a family. It is really important for all society and people. I like this message from this movie. The crazy man Aziz just doing great."

I was geeting emotional when my eyes on screen. the most interesting , important , and the soul of this movie sentence is the last sentence ""I am in love with my wife"" that was awesome. tears has come on my eyes when the i have heared..amazing film"
" FIRST GET THE TISSUE BOX
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,10,"MY first Turkish movie and worth watching it. My cousin suggested me this movie first. He is a really cold hearted person but when he suggested me this movie and told he never cried this much before, I was so surprised. Now after watching this movie ai can understand what he meant there. 
This movie is just a small piece of a world which is getting destroyed by the current stupid digitalization and globalization. This is the wirld where a person always wants to go for relief. I was always a nature loving person and preferred village life over city life. So this movie had no flaws in making my heart shaken for once more. I fell in love with nature, village life, easy normal yet strong bonds between families, animals by watching Mucize. Thank you so much Allah for this life."
" One of the greats
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,9,"Not a quote to quote, not any metaphor or joke to crack. But surely this movie is one of the greats. I got so into it that It seemed like time stood still the whole time. Mert Turak you killed it man."
" BEST movie ever made on Earth
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,10,"I saw the film yesterday, & i think this is the best movie about LOVE & Honor of Mankind. Great movie. ALL the Mankind should see & learn from this movie."
" A Brilliant Story about Life,Love and Compassion
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,10,The first thing I love about this movie is the storyline. It starts with a journey and takes to a different path. The second thing I love about the movie is location and cinematography. I wonder why this movie is not in the famous movie review blog's list.It is a must-watch kind of movie.
" Hopelessly crippled young man overcomes all obstacles
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,7,"First, many thanks to all the Turkish and Zaza Kurdish reviewers who wrote out of their own experience in the cultures shown in the film. It's not easy to do that in one's second or third language. As someone who has worked very hard on his Turkish, I know this firsthand. My wife and I watched Mucize together with the subs; our ear for eastern rural pronunciation is weak, since we lived entirely in Izmir and Istanbul. The story is, as other have pointed out, both simple and profound. Simple because village life in the early 1960s (the time I first went to Turkey on military duty) was one of very little contact with the outside world. Profound in the fact that, yes, unconditional love does ""cover a multitude of sins"" and shortcomings. Turks and Kurds can be profoundly loving. They can also be deeply disrespectful and cruel toward the handicapped and less fortunate. As can Americans. I say this out of a years long personal friendship with a young man in his 30s who is, even today, as severely handicapped as Aziz. My greatest wish for a stronger and even more moving film is this: the true story here is not the love of the village or the schoolteacher, even though those elements were a huge part of the story. The real story is what takes place between Aziz and his wife in the minutes (years) between their leaving the village and their return. What challenges did they overcome together? HOW did she ""love"" him from the severely crippled and incoherent young man in the first two hours of the film, into the handsome, well-spoken, well-presented man we see in the final few minutes? THAT is the real miracle, and yet we are denied that story. THAT story is the story of how to restore and rebuild and redeem a life that, to all appearances, seems beyond hope. I hope the director will one day tell THAT story because it will be the one that moves viewers beyond admirable expressions of sympathy, and into action that will, like Aziz's wife, and Aziz himself, create real miracles."
