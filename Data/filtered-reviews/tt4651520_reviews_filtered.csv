" One of the worst movies made!
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,1,How does this have over 6 stars? This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever watched. I got about 45 minutes into this feminist trash movie and had to turn it off. Nothing but over the top vulgar humor. There is really nothing good to say about this movie. It is pure garbage and a waste of time.
" I found 'Bad Moms' entertaining
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,8,"I found 'Bad Moms' entertaining.Mila Kunis carries it I must say, without her I think I'd be rating this a fair chunk lower. She is amusing and keeps the film chugging along, helped by the pacing and music which also move the film along nicely. There is a good amount of gags, I certainly enjoyed watching it.Away from Kunis (Amy), you have a whole host of recognizable faces. Kristen Bell (Kiki) and Kathryn Hahn (Agath..sorry, Carla) are pleasant in their respective roles, Hahn is borderline irritating but I'd say she sticks to the right side just about. Christina Applegate (Gwendolyn) and Jada Pinkett Smith (Stacy) also feature, as does Wendell Pierce (Daryl). Shoutout, also, to 'The Walking Dead' alum Ann Mahoney.There are also sweet end credit scenes. It's a lot better than 2017's 'Fun Mom Dinner' too, no doubt about it. Interested to watch the sequel."
" Fun movie!
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this a lot - took a standard plot about a bored housewife and made it fun! I found this a lot better than other recent family comedies like Daddy's Home, which just rely on the cringe factor for laughs.Lots of harsh reviews for this which is a surprise, it had the right combination of drama and humour, and acting well done by all the cast. Sure, it's not the funniest movie in the world, but I think it manages pretty well to be entertaining."
" Bad moms 3
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,10,I love both movies. I wish the next one is where Karla gets married to ty. Like a bad moms wedding... I know that would make my year...
" Loved it!!
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,10,"The movie made me laugh, made me happy, made my day, loved it... nothin else to addðŸ˜Œ"
" Two thumbs up
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,9,Absolutely hilarious movie built on top of some real life drama. Mila is a great actress and had great supporting female co-stars. If you need a laugh I recommend watching this movie.
" bad moms?
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie is so good to watch and entertaining. Mila kunis and her friends here nailed it.
This is not 'bad' mom. She just want some justice for herself, have fun and still be a responsible mom for her kids."
" Wow, I don't know why there is so much hate for this movie
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,8,"It's a funny, light hearted movie. Yes, there are clichÃ©s and some crude moments. But I love it. I could go on about how it's empowering for women, taking back control etc, but most of all, it's funny, it's hilarious."
" It's funny
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,6,"This is a comedy film and it does exactly what it needs to do: Make you laugh.
Nothing more, nothing less. Of course, one could focus on the narrative and the uniqueness of the film, but that would be missing the point. When it comes to watching films, there are, broadly speaking, two kinds of people: Those who turn their brain on (and who analyze the film for what it has to offer) and those who turn their brain off (and who just want to be spoon-fed something enjoyable and predictable). Both are completely fine, and I believe people can switch between the two modes (or even find something in between). This film is for those who just want a good, albeit predictable, laugh. The chemistry that Mila Kunis, Kathryn Hahn, and Kristen Bell share, works in favour of this. That's all there is to it. Predictable and fun. Bad Moms is just that, and it does not try to be anything else."
" No this movie
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,1,"The film offers nothing new, everything has been seen many times. Continued Part sure the same level?"
" Judged Too Harshly
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,6,"Is it perfect? No.
Is it over the top, sweary, and a bit cringey? Yes.
But what makes this movie good is it's core theme; Moms are human too. I think it's a good view on our society and looking at the stress mothers face."
" Exaggerated comedy lower than Adam sandler
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,5,"Cons
Unoriginal
Boring stereotypes
Standard jokesPros
Showing how mean women are to each other
Great cast
Decent soundtrack
Kristen Bell"
" Why so much hate?
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,7,"It's a good movie, literally just made for fun. There's no huge, deep meaning in it. Just showing how women are trying their best and still beat themselves up for not being perfect. It was funny, silly, and had moments of seriousness, but mostly just a story to take you away from your own hard day to day struggles. There were a couple of lines that stood out as not exactly fitting in with the rest of the movie. And I thought the whole sexy widow storyline wasn't necessary. But I found it enjoyable and would watch it again."
" Hilarious movie, okay story and great cast
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,7,"I seriously can believe how much bad reviews im seeing of this film?The cast is full of A listers that do great in there charismatic roles. There's the main 3 best friends that are really different to each other but funny in there own ways. Then 3 sort of villain moms that do a great job of making you hate them but also add to the darker humor of things. All other cast members were memorable and added there piece to the puzzle but i will say some of the male depictions are pretty chessy, cliche and somewhat sexist but that never took away too of the film for me at least. Some of the mom scenes and acting are also cringey from time to time but again it wasn't that bad.Story:
The plot isn't the most unique and it is very cheesy and cliche but overall I really enjoyed it! Im sure lots of parents can relate to this film and even non parents can appreciate the comedic struggles. This has a good balance between problem, character development, and resolving the problem with a finale of the happy ending. I thought the mix between the real world struggles and the charismatic cast with great jokes here and there was fun to just sit back and laugh at. Your not getting a oscar winning plot here but I think a interesting and funny take on parenthood. I will say some scenes are a bit bogus, cringe, and is trying a bit too hard. but hence why this isn't a 10/10. Overall pretty dang enjoyable plot.Summary:
I would highly reccomend this film to anyone looking for a funny relaxed weekend flick. Its not perfect but I dont think it was trying to be."
" so funny
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,10,"I don't care what anyone else says, this movie is super funny!! It cracked me up! It was silly, over the top, and still honest. Plus it made me laugh so much and so loud."
" awesome movie
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,10,"Don't expect anything new or mind-blowing - it is simply 90 minutes of pure fun. No sophisticated plot - mother of 2 is having hard time balancing her kids, husband and work, so she decides to quit trying to do everything perfect. She stops helping kids with their homework or making their breakfast, kicks out her sort of cheating husband and decides to run for PTA president with help of two new friends - one divorced cougar and one meek housewife. Rated R - only because of strong language, which is not surprising - you can kill 100 people on screen and still be PG, but if you use C*word - you get R-rated ;) Watch it and have fun, brain-relaxing experience"
" Endearing fluff
",2020-07-22 00:00:00,6,"Silly yet endearing fluff about three moms who are mad as hell and they're not going to take it anymore. They opt out of the achievers' club and opt in for sin. What kind of sin? One mom makes her kids get their own breakfast every morning. Another makes her husband take care of the children himself, sometimes at least. The third, near as I can tell, just keeps doing what she always did, which is to say she propositions any man in arm's reach. What's not to love?"
" Cute if nothing else to watch
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,5,"Just not a change your life movie , not that they all need to be. It's cute but not all that ok the actresses are cute or at least most of them. Now it really bothered me how nasty Kathryn Hahn talked thru the movie. The others did not feel the need to have to talk that nasty and it was not attractive, it looked desperate. It's not necessary to tell what you will do with he male body part ..again....and again....and again....we get it. It really does cheapen movies when these terms are used over and over thru out because even though it's a no think movie , we do still have a brain"
" Unrealistic
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,1,"Poor expressions, unrealistic plot and you can guess every twist before it happening. Dialogues were good though ."
" What a Giant Heaping Pile of Crap Sprinkled with a few nice thoughts
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,2,"They took a party movie and sprinkled a few speeches by the underwhelming Miila Kunis to take your attention from the fact that this movie just sucks and has a ton of awful awful ideas. Basically: Father's are idiots who don't care about the kids and take mothers for granted. It's OK to dispose of your family so you can sleep with a good looking parent. Kids have no real value and no long term emotions, if you consider yourself a good mom you can fix it all. This was utter garbage with terrible actresses. This movie is a good reflection of our garbage society. Good work empowering women to dispose of their families."
" Loved it!
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,10,"It always astounds me when people have to be unnecessarily cruel in the review of a movie. There are movies I absolutely abhor, but I won't post some negative comments online because I know the people who take part in making the movie put a lot of work into it and can be irreparably damaged by the words that they hear, particularly from people who hide behind their computer screens. It's called being human and having empathy.Personally, I LOVED this movie. I love the focus it puts on the pressures of being a parent & the pressures that, generally but not always, get put on a mother in particular. Women tend to be more worried about what others around them think, so it makes sense that they feel a certain kind of pressure men don't feel. I'm not a parent, so I'll nix now any reviews that say you have to be a parent or a mom to enjoy it. I laughed the entire time and let myself relax watching. I didn't pick anything apart because that's not necessary when watching a comedy, a movie specifically made to enjoy & not criticized for anything else. It's heartfelt. You can feel the love that came from making it, from the acting & all other positions. I immediately watched A Bad Mom's Christmas after because I wanted that loving feeling to continue. Everyone in this movie did a fantastic job, even if not everyone enjoyed it. Keep doing what you're doing & ignore the haters."
" funny
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,10,Its good to watch and its fuuny and real happen in our life
" The title is half right I guess
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,3,A truly awful cast coupled with the usual unimaginative writing stumbling through every cliche in the Hollywood book.The idea that Mila Kunis is a desperate singleton who can't get a man because of her 'mom-bra' is an insult to the viewer and reason enough to turn this nonsense off. The other supposed 'Bad Moms' are little more than crappy parents with attitude problems.This is just lame mildly sexist nonsense trying desperately to appeal to an audience who won't even watch a film like this. Garbage.
" Cliched, but a reasonably fun time
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,6,"Kathyrn Hahn absolutely steals the show in this comedy about moms rebelling. She's a riot and the film somewhat drags when she isn't on screen. It never takes full advantage of its premise, but there's enough talented actors involved to lift it up above most raunchy comedies like this. It won't blow your mind, however you should be able to find some good laughs."
" You guys are ridiculous
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,10,"This was a very funny movie, I think most people who watched it were boomers who that it was ""debauchery"" and ""unfunny"" Really? Are you serious? This movie was made as an adult comedy for young people, not by overly religious bozos that take offense to atheists. It's rated R for a reason"
" Raunchy
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,6,Just the right amount of raunchiness in this hilarious comedy. The only issue is with this recycled story line they did not add anything new.
" ClichÃ© af.
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,1,Such a disappointment. Such poor writing. ClichÃ©s and sexism and stereotypes and.... Omg that was bad.
" All the angry women on here are Gwendolyns
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely love this movie. It really depicts the struggles that all different types of moms go through, and it does it with a sense of humor. I saw it in the theater with a bunch of other moms and we couldn't stop laughing!!! So if this movie offended you maybe take a xanax and have  with your husband for the first time this year."
" Ignore the bad reviews....
",2019-11-29 00:00:00,6,"I really enjoyed this film, its fun and witty and a great laugh
Ignore even one else who is slating it, OK its not the best film in the world but it cheered me up and wish I'd watched it sooner... Look g forward to watching the sequals"
" I want to punch myself...
",2019-11-29 00:00:00,1,"...for making me watch this...thing! I don't know why i had the idea to watch this film, but i didn't expect to be that bad. It's a fest of very bad jokes, clichÃ©s and feminism. The character of Carla, seriously, she's suppose to be the, funny, goofy one but i just wanted to punch her in the face sooooo hard!!! All men are sexists or stupid and the women are nice and strong okay we get it... This was one very bad movie."
" I couldn't think of a good pun conveying how the movie is better than the Moms ostensibly are.
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this rally of girl-power flag waving which (in lieu of actual jokes) celebrates living life for you alongside the people you love, rather than just for the people you love.A lot of fun with rich characters. I wouldn't call it particularly feminist or anti-feminist, it just sort of IS.My only real negative is the curious way the want to push infant genital mutilation on us. I guess it was written by a Texan."
" Meh
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,5,"Cheesy. Has good moments, but also doesn't really make that much sense.
So, Amy is a busy mom who spoils her kids way too much. Doing their homework, making food etc - until she doesnt.
So, suddenly Amy gets a few friends and starts bailing on work, partying and making her kids actually do stuff themselves.
That supermarket scene was a bit weird.
Then comes the sad montage when she gets fired from her job, her daughter gets set up with marihuana in her locker, and then ther daughter gets mad at her for some reason, and says she's the worst mom. WTF?
Is this supposed to make me feel bad? Her kids were spoiled, ungrateful  all along.
Also, the lighting in this movie is weird. Almost looks like it was filmed with a dirty lens sometimes.Overall, pretty mediocre."
" Quite fun
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,8,"If you like the ""Hangover"" movies, you also like this!"
" Moderate family comedy
",2019-09-16 00:00:00,7,"Bad Moms is a drama comedy (more comedy) about parenthood, friendship and ways to raise children.Bad moms has potential themes but these are treated unnecessarily lightly. A beginning of the movie is worth watching. A latter half of the movie is worse than first half.The Plot is basically good but unrealistic towards the end. There are three main characters in Bad Moms. They are Amy played by Mila Kunis, Kiki played by Kristen Bell and Carla played by Kathryn Hahn. They get tired of the pressures of a family with children. Leader, Gwendolyn played by Christina Applegate, of the School Parents' Association with her friends, Stacy and Vicky, demand perfection in parenting. Amy, Kiki and Carla make friends and join forces against a common enemy (Gwendolyn, Stacy and Vicki) in the Association election.The Movie is not too long. Actors and funny scenes carry through the movie. Rather week end of the movie decreases grade.Bad Moms is the moderate film. It's worth watching as a fun entertaining comedy. but not as a serious drama comedy. 7/10"
" Bad Moms? Bad Movie!!!
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,4,"Let me say that I don't believe in 1 ratings as I don't believe in 10 ratings, but I swear I could not go over 4 for this one. And in my world, this is very bad. I simply could not watch the last 20 minutes so I left it in the background so I can write this review. I'm not hating, I'm just stating a fact: bad acting, bad writing, bad movie even for it's genre."
" It was better than I expected
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,10,I thought this movie was going to be bad but my god I loved this movie. It has the humour and the drama. The 3 woman are amazing. Highly recommend
" Such an INCREDIBLY FUNNY FILM
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,10,"Bad Moms is such a wonderful movie!!! It has laughter throughout the entire movie. Love, tension, lessons learned, true friendships blossom!!!! I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE ABOVE THE AGE 18!!! A+++ Film."
" 10 stars
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,10,"I really enjoyed this movie, it was hilarious and unpredictable. I love the three main actresses. They are fantastic."
" I saw myself in these bad moms - must watch!
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,10,"Bad moms is a filled with laugh out loud moments. The movie is lighthearted and unpretentious. Of course I'd have loved to see more racial variety in the main characters, but Mia, Kristen and Kathryn did a pretty good job, more so because their characters balanced each other out.I'm so glad that I got the opportunity to watch bad mom. It is a feel good film for a mom like me who is tired of feeling overworked and under appreciated. :)"
" Bad Moms
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,10,10/10 - non-stop laughs and a charming cast keeps this modern comedy fresh and worth repeat viewings
" my notes
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,7,Surprisingly very funny with a nice story that makes sense and isn't useless. I was laughing throughout and had nothing to complain about except for a cheesy scene. Lots of great characters. Even though it seems like a girl movie this is more like girls doing guy comedy (2 viewings)
" Surprisingly very funny
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,8,Slapstick laughs and well written lead characters contribute to this being a lot funnier than I expected.
" Not bad.
",2019-06-08 00:00:00,6,"The team of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore started their careers by contributing uncredited rewrites to movies like Wedding Crashers, 27 Dresses and Monster-in-Law. Their breakthrough was The Hangover, which gave them the juice they needed to start co-directing movies of their own. This film was a surprise success for them, grossing around $183 million worldwide.Amy Mitchell (Mila Kunis) is married with two kids, living in the Chicago suburbs and working for a cool coffee company. Even though she does everything right, she feels like she's constantly losing, which is exacerbated when catches her husband having cam sex with his mistress.Now, she must learn to deal with being a single mom and battling the moms who do everything right, like Gwendolyn (Christina Applegate), Stacy (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Vicky (Annie Mumolo).Joining up with Carla (Kathryn Hahn, who voiced the new Dr. Octopus in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse) and Kiki (Kristen Bell, who is great in this), they decide to quit the PTA. However, Gwendolyn gets to our heroine and she decides to challenge her presidency.My favorite part of this film was the credits. No, I'm not being mean. It's a cute little comedy. But the best part is that at the end, the stars answer questions with their real-life mothers. Christina Applegate mentions that her mom (they appeared together in Jaws of Satan) took her to see Al Pacino in Cruising when she was 9 years old. This is even funnier because her TV dad, Ed O'Neill, is also in that film."
" Trash and Pathetic
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,1,"Absolutely useless film. Utter garbage, filth, trash and pathetic. Grow up ladies!! I give it one star for the end credits. The ladies with their real life mum. That's the kinda stuff I wanna see!!"
" Predictable Girl Power and Little Too Raunchy
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,5,"Bad Moms has a few humorous moments here and there, but the movie was predictable and sometimes felt like it was a little excessive with the raunchiness and curse words, which gets boring and predictable quickly. Mila Kunis did a great job but this movie should have tried to be more creative and different from other similar comedy movies.This is an R-rated comedy for the most part, that can't decide whether to be excessively vulgar or take the 'feel good' family-friendly route, so it tries to juggle both, leaving you with a 'I've already seen this movie' feeling at the end.The script wasn't very fun and entertaining. Bad Moms could have probably been much more successful with light-hearted humor and a PG or PG-13 rating. The issue here is that we've already seen excessively raunchy R-rated comedies from Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Will Ferrell, and countless other great comedians - and those films worked at the time. But when you try to recreate the same thing with a female-lead cast, what originality are you really bringing to the table?"
" Easy watch comedy
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,6,An easy watch film that does have some funny moments
" Mila Kunis is one of the most underrated actresses today. She's so funny.
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,6,"Sloppily constructed but undeniably funny, Bad Moms does effectively find the humor in situations that are going to ring true to a large audience."
" Ugh, is this an SNL movie?
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,2,"Can't believe this is labeled as a comedy. The writing's terrible, half of the acting is sub-par and unbelievable, the kid and male characters are almost entirely superficial, the humor is demeaning, and I can't fathom why anyone would agree to do this movie. The only redeeming aspect is that it has a few well-known stars with real acting chops. Unfortunately, most of their talent is wasted on the poorly developed plot. Only watch it if you want to waste a couple hours... maybe watch it muted."
" It's a mom thing.
",2019-04-19 00:00:00,7,"The kitchen scene with Mila Kunis's character and her son sealed the deal for me. Pouring cereal all over the table while complaining about having to ""cook"" his own breakfast and whining about being a slow-learner so Mom shouldn't refuse to do his homework for him was great. Christina Applegate's character was hilarious...daughter named Ghandi?? OMG. Jada was funny, reminded me a little bit of her character on Gotham, if that character was a PTA mom. All around, raunchy but fun."
" Zero female energy
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,2,"This is such an embarrassing movie.
It is so unbearably pretentious. It's basically a high school teen movie in mum format.
Every dialogue in it was desperate for the public's approval, the public being dumb, modern feminists with pseudoproblems. The writers are male and it shows in every way possible. There is actually nothing in it that females, mums, can relate to. Unless they're generation z females who as mentioned before are modern feminists with pseudoproblems, like free bleeding and being judged on their instagram account. They have zero human essence and are all about buzzwords, much like this movie.
The dialogues really were the worst thing ever. It was just such painful cliche, every single word they said. Women, mums do not say things or act like that. They had put the words of teenage boys or immature men into mums. It was just unbearable.
And then the characters and the plot - wow, a bunch of mean girls, the ""underdog"" in the form of a rebel who thinks she's special cause she doesn't go along with what is presented as the majority in the film. And then the pathetic hot guy. I still feel major second hand embarrassment over how the ""mean girls"" were all hot for him and the dude went for the ""underdog"" like in a true american teen romcom.
Everything about the film was just so wrong. The mums actually WERE bad and not because they were following the majority at the start or cause they were rebelling against it, the writers just have zero clue about being a mum and how mums feel about kids and handle them. It felt like the writers had been brought up by single dad and they were gay themselves, never had any female contact.
There was zero female energy in the film. Majorly cringeworthy.
Plus the film itself failed in the plot too. At the start they're saying how the have those ""mum dreams"" and yet what gets them all popular and their plan into motion is some stupid male frat party type of event.
I just cannot believe how embarrassed I still am after watching the film. It is just cringeworthy.
I would have given it only one star but I like the actress Kathryn Hahn. I didn't like her character just like all the rest but I like her in general. So, she gets a point."
" 'I don't know how she does it!'
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,6,"Where Sisters and Bridesmaids seem based on some real experience and emotion, this is much more a carefully targeted attempt to hit a certain demographic (the title tells you who exactly) - and note that unlike those films it's written by men. Of all the ridiculously wishful events, the one that really gives the game away is when Mila Kunis' boss begs her to come back because they can't manage without her. And pigs might fly! The whole thing is geared to telling its audience how marvellous and unappreciated they are, and how 'if they hold on, things'll go their way'. So this is an okay hen comedy, but a bit cynical."
" Awfully Bad Moms
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,2,"Unless you love crude humor, I would skip this movie. The overall concept of the movie was fine, but I just couldn't get over how much they relied on crude humor to drive the funny moments in this movie, which don't get me wrong, it did have funny moments. I also didn't necessarily think that the relationship aspect with the new ""boyfriend"" was really all that pivotal to the plot if you took him completely out of the movie, nothing changes.I watched it, now I can store this one as a ""yeah I've seen it""."
" Starts well but gravitates into a swear fest plotless romp
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,5,"Bad moms starts extremely well, you're pretty much hooked and the film presents itself as a reasonably original romp. However, at some point maybe half an hour in, it gravitates into becoming a pointless swear fested pretty plotless chick-flick. It appears that the writers ran out of ideas and allowed the director and actors to make it up as they went along..."
" Surprised
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,8,Loved Mika kunis!!!! Super funny very relatable with all the stories that go on with the female figures in my life. Very sexy too.
" Average...
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,5,"""Bad Moms"" is a Comedy movie in which we watch a mom trying to handle everything in her house and work. Her husband does not help her and she has to do everything by herself from going their kids to school to clean the house. Everything changes when she finds two other women who are at mostly the same situation as her and they all start to change their conventional responsibilities in order to find some time for themselves.I have to admit that I expected more from this movie and was seriously thinking that it's going to be different from other comedies with parents which I had already seen. Unfortunately, this didn't happen because the plot was boring and a few funny scenes could not save this movie. The simple plot isn't bad and this was proved in many movies but it's not working for this movie. Despite the simple and boring plot, I liked the interpretations of Mila Kunis who played as Amy and Kristen Bell who played as Kiki and she was hilarious at some points. The direction which was made by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore was an average but I have to say that I really liked the ending of this movie which was beautiful.Finally, I believe that ""Bad Moms"" isn't a bad movie just another average one with which you can spend your spare time, laugh a bit and enjoy it. Just don't expect much from this movie and you won't be disappointed by it."
" Great movie
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,10,I loved this movie. I have watched it several times. I laugh my butt off through this movie. I sometimes watch it when I need a pick me up in mood.
" Snowflakes!
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,10,"Funny movie. It really is. You just need to be able to laugh.Sadly, these days, no-one laughs.I do. Especially at most of the 'reviews' on here from people who clearly forgot how to sit back and enjoy easy comedy.This film AND the Christmas sequel are really funny and worth a watch by anyone who actually likes to laugh out loud without being easily offended."
" hell yeah moms!
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,10,Funny and crazy mom movie. very entertaining. good cast.
" I don't regret that I traded my siesta for BadMoms
",2018-10-19 00:00:00,7,"To those who have yet to see this film, please do not let the reviews here dissuade you. Please, see BadMoms. And judge for yourself."
" This film should just be called ""bad""
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,1,Upon an unfortunate series of events ( mainly my friends taste in films) I watched this film. She is lucky her I pad didn't go out the window. The only happiness I felt was when it ended.
" Didn't laugh
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,1,I did not laugh one single time while watching this movie. Not once.
" Loved it
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,10,"Don't get me wrong, it's not a deep film, it's not particularly clever but it was a light entertaining movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend. I think the negative reviews are harsh maybe from people who take their films a little to seriously. I just like something that's entertaining!"
" I really enjoyed this movie
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,8,It's like the girls from Mean Girls grew up and had kids and they're still going around judging each other! With lots of laugh out loud moments just like in Mean Girls.
" Absolutely appalled
",2018-09-15 00:00:00,1,"Was made to watch this instead of the football, fuming"
" Fun and too real
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,8,"This movie is not an oscar movie but it deals with a needed subject with a light hearted approach as to avoid being an afternoon special. 
Sometimes it's hilarious and it can be depressing as being a parent can be. 
All in all It's a fun time and kristen bell shines like the comedy diamond she is."
" A Different Perspective Could Have Improved It
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,4,"(Flash Review)The core audience certainly is moms and secondarily parents. With core messages of it is OK not to be a perfect mom, mistakes will happen and why are we over-scheduling everything in today's culture. Kunis plays a working mother of two, with a schmuck of a husband, who hits a mental and physical wall after a militaristic PTA mother negatively interferes with her daughter's life. Enraged she campaigns against her for the head of the PTA election. Will she be able to turn the popular tide and help other moms re-calibrate what's important in life? This movie could have been more impactful with more plausible plot points, less over the top crassness and a not so expected story arc. Some of the reoccurring jokes overstayed their welcome but there were some entertaining moments. Overall, this is a simple movie for moms to watch and relax with a drink in their hand and not worry about not being perfect."
" Hilarious!
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,6,"Bad Moms is like Mean Girls 15 years later, set in Chicago. The Mean Moms are Christina Applegate and her two followers. The main lead is Mila Kunis, and her character is a struggling mom who tries to get her act together and put everything in perfect order...but she just can't do it. We follow her struggles, and it's just funny. Kathryn Hahn is the funniest one here, and I simply love her!"
" Funny if you can forget how school actually works
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,7,"This movie is funny but you have to suspend all belief about how school actually works. No parent decides what classes students take, men are in the PTA, and good luck ever knowing what time it is. It's just a movie and it's funny so it gets the stars, but some aspects are ridiculous."
" Bad Words + Inneundo = Funny
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,3,"This movie is probably the worst comedy I have seen. It's lowbrow, stupid and crude. I'm not saying all comedy has to be super smart and mature. I'm fine with crude humor and sexual jokes, as long as they're actually clever and funny. These jokes aren't. Half of it is just bad words and talking about how they want to have sex with people, and this is somehow supposed to be hilarious. All in all, it's a horrible comedy that bases its humor in bad words. It could be written by 12 year olds."
" Bad examples of what a woman/mother should be.
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,3,"It had its funny scenes but it ended up just being another 'girl power' movie with a completely unrealistic storyline. Sadly, it's just another example of what Hollywood thinks real life is....and it ain't. Don't feel bad if you skip bad moms."
" Embarrassingly bad
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,1,"This was hard to watch. The characters are a collection of stereotypes, the story has probably been written in 3 days and not to mention the jokes. I spent the entire movie wondering what Kathryn Hahn was doing. And they've made a second one..."
" I would give -20 if was possible
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,1,"Comedy?! Didn't see anything comedy in that. Think that movie can be use as textbook for narcissism and how it looks in reality. Women who complain how bad is their life and why they have children and so on. Dear ladies we live in 21 century and if you don't want children-it is ok. And for hard life-ask navy seals, ask the marines and children who grown up in narcissistic families. Loosing of time is that movie."
" Bad Moms-So-so Movie
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,5,"It had its moments but overall, could have and should have been better given the cast. Mediocre writing and acting undermined the film pretty much from the beginning."
" Enjoyable female-oriented rudeness
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,7,"Amy's life is too busy: her useless husband doesn't help, her daughter has demanding school activities, her annoying boss has turned her part-time job into full-time without paying her for it so, when PTA tyrant Gwendolyn pressures her over cakes at the Bake Sale, Amy cracks and, accompanied by sex-mad Karla and timid and downtrodden Kiki, they decide to leave the demands of motherhood behind in favour of more immediately satisfying activities.This film - according to its publicity - wants to be a female version of The Hangover. But Bridesmaids already did that and, besides, Bad Moms turns out to be about moms who aren't really bad at all, they're just moms.Mila Kunis, as protagonist Amy, plays straight man to Katherine Hahn's very funny horny mom Karla, and Kristen Bell's meek and slapstick-prone Kiki. Christina Applegate plays Machiavellian PTA mastermind Gwendolyn very well despite having one of the least credible changes of heart I can ever recall in a film.There aren't many belly laughs, but I chuckled often. The discussion about circumcised vs uncircumcised amused me, even though I am not the target audience (I'm not sure who the target audience actually was: this sort of raunchy comedy usually seems aimed at the twenteens, but the material here would strike a chord with mothers of school-age children. The two groups aren't mutually exclusive, but they don't have huge crossover either).There is some heart, too, albeit clearly engineered precisely to tug at the heartstrings - Karla's final exchange with her son being a case in point.
And the interviews over the closing credits between the 6 main female actors and their real-life mothers were great.Comedy movies - well, all films, really - are very personal, and what might appeal to one person doesn't necessarily appeal to another. Much US opinion is against this on the grounds that it's anti-male. I didn't give that a thought, and quite liked it."
" This movie sucks!
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,3,"The way the characters are portrayed are terrible. You absolutely do not feel with them. The kids are so spoiled and selfish that it is too terrible to look at. When the love interest of Kunis tells her that her kids are kind, I could only laugh! ""Moms"" are portrayed as weak... Why?!"
" Who doesn't find horrible parenting, adultry, and neglect hilarious? Oh yeah... me...
",2018-05-15 00:00:00,1,"Really bad movie. Bad Mom gets to run the PTA because she sucks at being a mom and drops the f-bomb. In truth, the PTA appeared to be a pretty slick working machine. For all the pro-feminism gestures, Amy marries a bum and stays with him long enough while his over the top neglect to his family and entitled abuse and open infidelities at his wife expense are so over sold, you wonder why such a strong women would subject her kids (or make kids) with this asshole.Then we have bad mom #2 who is also bullied by a husband who appears to suffer from some sexual dysfunction so she mocks him for it... This move sucks, is not funny, and was a waste of my time..."
" Sign up to IMDB just to review this piece of crap
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,2,"Just don't waste your time. 
It's a movie supposed to make you feel ok about being a clueless overgrown teenager with kids."
" Very Funny
",2018-04-21 00:00:00,8,Wow So many PC reviewers on here I can't believe you beauts. Chill the f out relax and have a laugh.Very Funny so ignore the negative reviews they've obviously no sense of humour.
" Good fun movie. Shame about the sound
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,6,"Good fun movie. Lots of energy and chemistry. Enjoyable watch. Would score it higher but the sound department screwed up in this area. Voices are to low and music to loud leaving you constantly asking ""what did she say"" after your ears have been assaulted."
" Terrible Movie!
",2018-04-12 00:00:00,1,"This movie was stupid and not funny. Poor excuse for a comedy. Did not like Mila Kinas in this movie. She has an old, hard look about her now. Don't waste your time watching this crap of a movie! Wish there had been an option for 0 stars."
" terrible and far to overated
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,1,I am so glad I didnt buy this and borrowed it instead. First 10 mins were ok but the persistent swearing got the better of me. I am no prude and some swearing is ok but it was overkill in this overated movie
" These Moms are so Bad...oh you get it.
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,5,"Mila Kunis would be an awesome mom. That's weird to say. She's way, way too attractive to me to view her as a mom. And we're close to the same age. Plus I wouldn't trade my mom in for anyone. You know how important family is to me... But if I was reborn and I had to pick a new mom, I'd go with Mila. WTF did I just say? Kristen Bell is crazy pretty and she is definitely pretty enough to play a princess. I do not understand why people would say that she isn't. Well, yeah I do actually but it's so not true! WTF did I just say? Kathryn Hayn is going way up on my hot scale after watching Bad Moms. WTF did I just say? Christina Applegate FINALLY has fulfilled her full funny potential in Bad Moms. I mean that. I love Christina and I've always seen a lot of her work and genuinely thought that she should be funnier on screen. Well she is laugh out loud hilarious in Bad Moms. Finally you sexy momma! I'm gonna crush on Christina hard for the rest of my life. WTF did I just say? Jada Pinkett Smith is a slutty mom in Bad Moms. WTF did she just say? Annie Mumolo is real pretty but she's new to me so I don't know WTF to say. Mila is a great lead in a comedy. Bad Moms is funnier than I expected and a little raunchier. I enjoyed seeing all these awesome and beautiful girls' mothers in the credits. To all the people who gave Bad Moms a bad review...WTF did you just say?"
" One of the bests comedy movies I've seen in years!
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,8,"It's really hard to find a good comedy movie when you've seen many. Most part of the times, the jokes are very similar and the stories always go around the same subjects.
When I saw ""Bad Moms"", I had an extremely good surprise! I laugh many times, the performances were great, the musics were perfectly picked and the story was autentic. This movie reflect the difficulties and the pressures about being a good mom nowadays in a very funny way. Me and my family had a great time watching this film!
I haven't seen ""A Bad Moms Christmas"" yet, but I'm really curious about that movie."
" An entertaining comedy if you don't overthink it...
",2018-03-08 00:00:00,7,"Ok I've read some of the bad reviews for this movie and a lot of the people that hate it are just taking it WAY TOO SERIOUSLY. It's not the frickin Da Vinci Code or Passion of the Christ ok? I personally really enjoyed this movie because I accepted it for what it is. Sure there are stereotypical characters (like Christina Applegate as the uberwealthy, overbearing head of the PTA) and clichÃ© dialogue and plot lines. But as a woman with no children I thought it was hilarious listening to the wacky dreams of mothers (like being hit by a car so they can be taken care of).So if you can put aside your desire for a movie to ""make sense"", ""have meaning"", ""correctly reflect reality"" etc. and think it would be funny for mums to throw a drunken house party, watch this movie."
" Bad Moms is just another average American comedy.
",2018-03-02 00:00:00,5,"Just so I clear this off my mind, annoyingly the American title remains for the UK release. Honestly, ""Bad Mums"" would've sufficed surely? I understand why (because the mothers are American) but still! Maybe it's just my OCD playing a part. Anyway, for this comedy we follow a few ""moms"" who are sick and tired of doing everything...and so they choose to rebel. So now you're asking: how do ""moms"" rebel? Well, they go partying trying to get laid and wreak havoc in slow motion within a supermarket to the background music of pounding pop/dance songs. I could easily go down the whole ""this is completely anti-male"" route...but let's take this with a pinch of salt and just enjoy it. As you all know, American comedies don't stick with me. Fortunately, this is actually above average and that's majorly down to the cast. Mila Kunis was great, she had charisma and screen presence. Christina Applegate is always a delight, even if she's the antagonist but the standout is Kathryn Hahn who's vulgarity and crudeness just gets results. Hear me out...I laughed twice because of her. Me laughing twice is like Christmas coming early, it doesn't happen often. Oh, Jada Pinkett Smith should not be on the front cover, she has like 5 lines of dialogue. Underused. Some of the jokes felt fresh but the majority of them were repeated from other films. Particularly the bra scene which was copying last year's The Boss...why on earth would you want to copy that I do not know. The story was functional, the basis of it revolved around a PTA election...I enjoyed it, nothing too memorable though. I guess in the back of my mind...I find the whole concept silly. If I was under that amount of stress (God knows I have been), I would just talk to someone...I wouldn't rebel. You don't see me starring in a film called ""Bad Employees"". My reviews for comedies always seem harsh, but honestly I was entertained and found it to be enjoyable enough to warrant another viewing in the future."
" Dreck
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,1,"I could only manage watching 20 minutes of this atrocious piece of crap before I had to stop. Someone should have mentioned to the writers that excessive exaggeration is not the same as comedy. I felt bad for Mila Kunis, who deserves (and has performed in) better roles in better films, such as Forgetting Sarah Marshall. I wish I could be more helpful, but, as I stated, I just could manage to make it through the whole film. My advice: don't waste your time. You'd be better served by taking a nap."
" Can I please have that 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life back?
",2018-02-17 00:00:00,1,"There's nothing bad to say about Bad Moms that hasn't already been said. So all I'm going to say is STX Entertainment, if you ever squeeze out a turd like this one that's too big to flush down the toilet, shove it back up where it came from. One of the worst movies I've ever watched."
" Bad Moms, Bad Movie, Bad Time
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,2,"This movie is bad on just about every level: concept, acting, writing, consistency. It's supposed to show how tough life is for moms these days but can't decide i it wants to be a raunch-fest, a family thing, or have a moral. A single mom (whose husband is a boob), a stay-at-home mom (whose husband is a tyrant), and a sex-crazed skank mom (no hubby) get together and - what exactly?They decide unfunny Mila Kunis needs to get laid so they transform her and go bar-hopping where one after another hot guy disconnects until hot single Latin father and she connect for the most chaste sex scene on film. (The real problem with female raunch films is that they don't want to get naked. Shades of 'Sarah Marshall', also with Bell and Kunis and also unfunny.) Hann is wholly unlikeable; a male character with the same characteristics would be decried. Think Rob Corrddry. Kunis gets fired, she can't reconcile with her ex-, her kids have problems - but she faces them all with the same bland non-angst.There's the evil PTA that somehow runs the school with the ""perfect"" moms as counterpoint which is so over the top that it's parody. What, no working moms have it together, or have good husbands? The manifesto speech at the end undercuts everything but of course the bond of momhood trumps all and they all fly off in a private jet. (What about the kids? Oh, moms gotta be moms).Save your money and your time."
" Sweet, predictive, sexist
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,6,"I found that movie easy and funny, though it was kind of sexist. 
If you rely on that movie to create your own picture on how a family works, you could eventually reach to the idea that in a regular family only the wife is really working hard, while the husband is spending 10 months on online dating/jerking, and/or walking around the cafeterias during the day, just to find his wife chatting with her friends in order to humiliate her as she is not with her kids as she 'should be'. It turns out that only the moms are really caring about what's going on at school. There is only one father and he is a widow - duh how convenient. Otherwise, he should be divorced, but still cool. How this can be possible if his wife is not cheating or he is not a jerk? No, he is cool and she has just passed away, keeping the ideal for the working mom, now he need to replace her, which is not an easy task.
Anyway, if you like Mila Kunis or want a nice, sweet comedy, this could be a good option."
" Avoid at all costs!! This is a horrible movie.
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,1,"The characters are unrealistic. The interactions between the characters are not to be believed. The jokes are horrible. Also, a very mean spirited movie. There is nothing redeeming whatsoever about this movie. I was surprised this ""movie"" had a budget of $20M. I could see $1,000,000, but not $20,000,000. Finally, this won awards? I could see Razzie awards, but not ""real"" ones."
" Light and breezy fun
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Bad Moms' (not sure why the spelling wasn't changed in Australia, like 'Bad Neighbours' was - lazy work, distributors) is a straightforward comedy, delivering what it should - easy laughs with not much seriousness. The irony is that the film was written and directed by two men... Amy (Kunis - the standout star here) is a mother of two, juggling all the chores and school drop-offs with a job and a disintegrating marriage. She semi-loses it when Gwendolyn (Applegate), the uptight PTA president, pushes her too far and challenges for the PTA leadership so all the mums have less stress and things to worry about in their lives.Kiki (Bell) is good as the repressed mother of four, but single mum Carla (Hahn) really steals the show, with her attitude and wisecracks. The montage when they go to the shops on their first night out together is gold. The other cast get some time, but not much, so it's really these three vs Applegate. The kids are good, but don't have much impact either.The soundtrack's crap, but there's a message in here somewhere. It's not that raunchy or dirty - except for a few moments - but does have way more laughs than I was expecting. Kunis is funny, sensitive, looks exceptional and carries the film. The end credits have the stars and their real-life mums reminiscing on couches - surprisingly touching."
" Great movie that's underated
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,8,"I loved this movie and I think the ""bad moms"" complemented each other well. This movie isn't just entertaining for mums only but for all women over the age of 18 I think. I would definitely watch this movie again after a 1 year period. I don't usually like Mila Kunis because she always seems to have the same facial expression to me but in this movie I absolutely loved her as the lead."
" It's been a while since I've laughed at silly humor
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,8,"To whoever reviews this as an awful movie:
1) you're stuck up
2) you're Gwendolyn kind of mom 
3) you think you are too intellectual to laugh at potty jokes
4) okay maybe you just didn't really like it I laughed a lot watching this movie, maybe because I caught it on TV last night and I had no idea what it was about and expected absolutely nothing from it. And as a mom, I can identify myself with lots of the experiences of these ladies trying to be a stepford wife and awesome mom baking pies and stuff.So lighten up, have a glass of cheap white wine and watch this movie, sure it has its flaws but come on! it's not meant to be a memorable film that will go down in history along with Citizen Kane, it's entertainment!!"
" Funny...at points
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,5,"What if the people who made ""Mean Girls"" grew up? Well, they would probably come up with this. It is mostly caricatures and obvious jokes mixed with a tiny bit of social insight/satire, but at least you get occasional super market montages. Seriously, the super market montage really was great...although not good enough to justify the other 2 hours."
" Watchable, but not real and an insult to most women
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,6,"Have to first admit I watched Bad Moms because of Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell. And there were some funny moments and I can certainly sympathize with moms...but not these moms.From what I understood, Amy and Kiki had husbands who were the main breadwinners, and Amy certainly lived in an affluent environment; why did she need a part-time job in the first place? She even says her husband was a successful mortgage broker. Kathryn Hahn's character, in addition to having a mouth that looked like it should have a hook in it (thank you Rodney Dangerfield), ONLY HAD ONE KID. And she couldn't deal with that? Did Kiki not know her husband was domineering before they got married and started having kids? These complaints seem more self inflicted than being victimized.I just don't see what these women expected when they got married and had kids. Maybe they thought it would be great to stay at home and not have the pressures of supporting the family financially like their husbands had to. Is it wrong to bring home the paycheck for food, clothing and shelter and want to just put the workday behind you? But I guess one day they realized they had a job to do as well and discovered it wasn't as great as they thought and wanted to get out. Just about every male character is portrayed in a negative light...even Jay Hernandez was served up as mere beefcake with no brain and nothing really to say. And by the way, his character was a widowed father and he seemed to have no issue with raising a kid. And any film that tries to portray JJ Watt as a squirming, weak soccer coach is really reaching to patronize women.But the worst was at the end where Kiki is walking with her husband and ordering him to do everything while sucking on a coffee drink that she could only afford because of her husband having a good job. So she wants to put even more crap on him just because she doesn't want to? I had no sympathy for any of them. As a line in the Big Chill said ""No one said it was going to be fun. At least no one said it to me""Show me a film with women who have to work full-time, underpaid and no on else to support them while trying to raise kids and I'll have respect for that. That's reality. This is not."
" Bad Moms, even worse movie
",2017-12-19 00:00:00,2,"""Bad Moms"" is an American 100-minute movie from 2016 written and directed by Scott Moore and Jon Lucas, the duo mostly known for The Hangover at this point still. And you could say that their work here is a mom version of the latter, but really a very unfunny one I must say. I may be a bit biased because there are several cast members in here that I am not much a fan of like Hahn, Bell and Smith, so it's no surprise that I would say it is between Hahn and Smith in terms of who is most unbearable in here. Probably Hahn gets the edge because she has so much more screen time, but JPS is a negative scene stealer too. The one who was pretty okay was Applegate, but being a huge MwC fan I'm probably biased here too. And how she completely changes towards the end and tells her big nemesis how her life sucks too was ridiculously bad with how she turns into a friend finally. This was a cringeworthy film from start to finish. Women often complain about how they are depicted in films. Strangely enough, some are mistaking this film for an elaboration on emancipation. Well, they should complain too given this film, but so should the males who are shown as bullies, cheaters etc. or of course Mr. Right. This movie has nothing to do with reality. It lacks authenticity and convincing shades from start to finish and I can only feel sorry for those audience members thinking the trio in here includes actually amazing women despite their flaws and struggles. Oh wait, those make them human no? I can only shake my head at that.Kunis is at the center of it all, but Hahn and Bell get their rushed-in ""deep"" and ""emotionally dramatic"" story lines too that involve the men in their lives that occasionally are also their sons. Pseudo character development of the worst kind. One bad joke follows the next in the film's extremely desperate attempts to be constantly funny. Sometimes less is more you know. I hoped this film would be better to be honest and I went in with an open mind, but I quickly saw this was not a good piece of work before eventually realizing this was horribly bad and a contender for 2016's worst. Shocked to see that this holiday season 2017 they are actually having a sequel out. Judging from this first film here, I have zero interest to watch it. I don't mind profanity if it has some wit attached to it (like South Park), but here this is definitely not the case. Everything about this project feels fake and for the sake of it, especially most of the performances. Kunis' maybe not, but she also does nothing really with her character. She just isn't as terrible as the other key players. The writing certainly isn't helping. A poor predictable excuse of a movie and let me say to my fellow German movie buffs that here we have the American equivalent to a SchweighÃ¶fer comedy. For the easily-entertained. The simple-minded. Highly not recommended."
" Bad Actress
",2017-11-15 00:00:00,3,"I really wanted to like this movie, but I kept being pulled out of the storyline by the terrible delivery of lines by Mila Kunis. ""Look at that mom bra..."" Mila Kunis destroying the delivery: ""This isn't my mom bra, this *is* my sexy bra.""Okay. No one said anything about a sexy bra in this scene. They only mentioned the 'mom bra'. So should the emphasis be on the word *is* in that line? Or should it be on the word *sexy*. Anyone with half a brain could tell you the answer. Some people say the dialogue in this movie stinks... I reckon it's all Mila. I think she just doesn't know what the hell is going on in each scene. Actually, the scenes where she gets slammed by a kid and ends up with spaghetti on her face are okay because she's not talking in them! She's such a bad actress. I knew it from that 70s show when she delivered every line in the same flat, seethingly hostile tone. Now she's learnt to deliver her lines with *some* variation, but it's still not right. How did she land the lead role in this? I swear it would have been better if ANYONE ELSE had gotten it - well, anyone who could act, that is."
" Whats wrong with you people
",2017-11-13 00:00:00,7,"If you rated this movie bad, it's because you're a mom with a stick up her butt! Talking about this was the worse frat boy humor. If you can't laugh or maybe you aren't a single mom and you do iron your husbands under pants. Have fun with that. I would totally be friends with those 3 main characters. I thought this movie was humorous, realistic and a total must see! So to all you Gwendolyns out there, I'd be the Amy and take the stick from your butts and beat you over the heads with it! LIGHTEN UP CHICKS!"
" Awful, Another woman good/man bad
",2017-11-13 00:00:00,3,"It's really tiring to watch the Hollywood clichÃ© of women are competent super moms and dads are either bumbling fools or cheating pieces of crap. In the first 10 minutes the mom does everything, works, takes the kids to school and extra curricular activities, makes dinner, helps the kids with homework etc. Then the dad is introduced and is portrayed as the clichÃ© uncaring buffoon. 5 minutes later he is jerking off to a woman 2000 miles away, on Skype, while his wife is in the next room being a good mom. She walks in on him and he is your typical asshole/buffoon. There is the set up to be a bad mom. Now she gets together with another woman (Kristen Bell) whose husband is controlling and wants her barefoot and pregnant. Finally, the third woman (Kathryn Hahn) is the free spirited, liberated, whore. This movie does a bang up job furthering the bumbling/asshole dad, super mom, and it's okay to be a whore Hollywood narrative. Oh ,and finally, Jay Hernandez is the only positive male lead because he is a single dad."
" Feels forced for crude content
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,3,"Bad Moms has a decent cast and the chemistry works among the lead actresses but overall the film tries too hard and forced in using overly sexual and crude content and for laughs and humor. Mila Kunis is very likable as the lead character as this was a good role for her, Kristen bell played her role well as for Katheryn Hanh was there for the crude and sexual jokes (most of which wore off and her act was not funny in the least). and Kr Deemed as a female version of the Hangover or slightly lesser version of Bridemaids, it is clear the intentions of Bad Moms was made due to those films being big successes. Though when we think of it, Bad Moms somewhat feels as an R-rated version of Mean Girls.Bad Moms was a surprise hit which is why the studios quickly greenlit a sequel an released it only one year later, however that doesn't mean the demand was such as high for a sequel. As many comedy films that are surprise or overachieving box office hits, their sequels usually end up under performing (in recent years- Ted 2, Neighbors 2). Overall the film isn't as funny as it could have been since a lot is forced and not very realistic, and the jokes do not stick. Predictable as well with a cop out type ending."
" Shockingly Bad
",2017-11-04 00:00:00,1,"Wife's turn to pick the Saturday night movie and somehow she came up with this. It's no more than soft porn, with the odd laugh at the expense of a man. Slapstick comedy at its worst, with foul language and overt sexual references throughout. Shocking Film - in every sense of the word!"

She befriends Kiki (Kristen Bell) and Carla (Kathryn Hahn) who are also tired of the whole super mom concept. With Wanda Sykes as a marriage counselor, she is a single mom. Amy butts heads with super mom Gwendolyn (no longer a hot teen Christina Applegate) vindictive president of the P.T.A. Amy is ""good at being late."" This is another over-the-top over-sexed potty mouthed woman comedy. ""Bridesmaids"" establish a successful formula and opened the flood gates for future endeavors, i.e. ""Sister"" and anything with Melissa McCarthy.

" This attempt at comedy is an insult to parents â€“ both moms and dads
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,1,"If Saturday Night Live was allowed (which it is not) to use the most vulgar language and represent the most vulgar situations this movie would be a barely passable skit. Written and directed by the same crew who brought us Hangover, it has a sliver of what made Hangover funny and the rest of this movie is what made Hangover hard to watch. Bad Moms is a pseudo feminist contrivance pretending to be a hilarious comedy. It's message is a 30-year-old clichÃ© - a clichÃ© that is delivered partly in the style of Charlie Chaplin slapstick and The Three Stooges buffoonery. My spouse and I saw Bad Moms at home streamed and neither one of us could get past the first half without looking for a wretch pale. Most people can't be slapped in the face with a joke and find it funny. And that is the way humor in this movie is delivered. Cheap laughs. Totally lacking any measure of sophistication. 90% of the humor was childish/gross/vulgar and undermined every attempt the director and writer may have made to put some meaning in this mess of a movie."
" Worth the Watch
",2017-09-08 00:00:00,10,"In all fairness, I do not see what it is wrong with this movie. Yes, I will be the first to admit that I had a few reservations about it after finding out that the guys behind ""The Hangover"" were responsible for the creation of it. After watching it a few times, I couldn't stop watching it. In my opinion, it is fall-down funny. Not everyone may agree and it doesn't matter to me. I have watched it with my brothers and mother and we couldn't stop laughing. I know that everyone is entitled to their opinion, but this movie was not meant to be taken seriously.In a nutshell, it can best be described as an R-rated ""Parenthood."" That's it. To make a long story short, being a parent is messy. There are no such things as ""perfect parents."" That's all this movie is trying to say. Everyone makes mistakes. That is it, that is all. Granted it would never win any Academy Awards, it is, as my title states, worth the watch. Watch it when you're having a bad day. If you don't like it, find something else. If you do like it, fantastic."
" Infantile and Unfunny
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,2,"According to IMDb, this won the People's Choice for Comedic movie. How sad that this was considered a funny flick. If girls making foul mouthed wisecracks is hilarious, then count it hilarious. A little slapstick and some outrageous comments by the characters does not a good story make.Yeah, it could've been funny, I guess. But the studio opted for trying to make girls who are in their 30s be guys in their teens. And guys in their teens are kind of funny only because they don't know better. But they learn. And even guys aren't usually that funny.The Bad Moms try to shock. Instead, they only produce rolling eyes and a yawn.Not even worth a Netflix."
" Promising cast, for an average comedy.
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,2,What this movie lacks is someone to carry this movie. Mila Kunis simply cannot carry an R rated comedy. Kathryn Hahn and Christina Applegate are unfortunately the only cast able to deliver anything close to funny.This is what happens when you take the comediennes out of the comedy. Prepare for an uncomfortable absence of on screen chemistry.
" Best comedy ever, don't listen to the bad reviews
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie was all great literally the best comedy I have ever watched. I don't know what movie did these people see to give it 1 star, but the movie i saw was amazing and an all time fun. The characters did a great job and all their roles were perfectly played out, the plot was funny and trust me YOU will enjoy this movie."
" Good Comedy!
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,6,"Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, Jada Pinkett Smith and Christina Applegate star in this 2016 comedy. Kunis (Ted, That 70's Show) plays Amy, a working mom who never has time for herself. Soon, she and 2 other moms, Kiki (Bell) and Carla (Hahn) decide to relax and have fun by cutting down their everyday routines. Applegate (Anchorman, Married with Children) plays Gwendolyn, an obnoxious, PTA member and Smith (Collateral) plays her friend, Stacy. This is a good comedy with a great cast, especially Kunis & Hahn and the girls' real-life moms also appear at the end credits. I recommend this."
" Good comedy - funny, irreverent and subversive
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,7,"Amy is a hard-working mom. Between caring for her two children, shuttling them to activities and having to pick up the slack for her lazy husband, she works at a company filled with millennials who have no work ethic or clue about her life. Even more unproductive is all the nonsense she has to endure just to be a ""good mom"". In particular, PTA meetings and other PTA functions. This leaves her no time for relaxation or just to be herself. One day she rebels against the system and decides to let go, ditching all the unnecessary bs in her life. This gains her some friends among the other moms - two in particular, Carla and Kiki - but pits her against the President of the PTA, Gwendolyn James, who is a nasty piece of work.Good comedy - funny, irreverent and subversive. While not a parent myself, I imagine it shows well all the nonsense parents have to put up with. This is especially the case in terms of what makes for a good parent and all the judgemental types that seem to think they know better about what's good for your kids and life than you. Bound to offend the uptight, humourless and judgemental, which makes it even better.Good performances by the main cast - Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn and Christina Applegate. Hahn gets the best lines.On the negative side, having struck upon a great comedic and social theme, the writers then try to shoehorn in some sentimentality. This feels out of place and runs contrary to the themes the comedy was espousing. Moreover, it is fairly empty and ruins the momentum of the movie. A straight comedy would have been even better.Overall: a bit uneven but generally good fun."
" Bad Movie
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,1,"This movie was awful! This rating isn't because I'm a man. It's because it's advertised as a comedy and isn't funny. I'm a parent and understand the point of the movie, and the demographic it was aimed for. So I believe women, more importantly mothers may still enjoy this movie. This is where I suspect many of the positive review came from; but the bad jokes and slow and awkward delivery were wasted on me. I love comedies and usually can find something positive to say; but not on this one. The message although positive and relatable is all it offers. The jokes feel forced and sad more than funny. I had high hopes, thinking it was going to be like Bridesmaids especially with this cast! I feel like the positive reviews are paid ones or are thinking of a different movie. Save yourself the time and money."
" Not for feminists or grounded women
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,1,"I-just-feel-so-hollow after watching this movie. I know it's meant to be a comedy and a suspension from reality. But I was not prepared for this raunchy horror. Does anyone care about morals or ethics anymore? Female empowerment is about living a life of your own either solo, with children, or within a family. It's not about being obsessed with all things male and ditching all your integrity. It's not about being foul-mouthed at every opportunity. Hollywood is on a mission to make the f-bomb mainstream. I am shaking my head witnessing the culture hitting bottom and worrying about this crassness entering the psyches of young parents and the newer generation of children, many of whom may be in earshot of this vulgar atrocity of a movie. To Mila and Kathryn and Jada, your acting abilities are too good for this dirt-path-of-a-movie. Please set your standards higher and rise above this embarrassment. How I wish I would have read the reviews on here first. Come on, America, let's get back on the high road for each individual's sake and for the sake of our children."
" Boring and not funny
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,5,This movie is really not worth watching. It is boring - not funny - no good jokes. The cast is not that bad but the story is just not good.They could have made a much better movie out of the idea. But they made it like all Hollywood movies that try to be funny at the moment. If you wanna relax on the couch and turn off your brain its OK. If you wanna watch a movie - choose something else.
" Feminism Trumps Comedy, Again
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,1,"This marks a new low in terms of screen writing and comedic failure.Again, we're hit over the head with the idea that mothers should shun their maternal responsibilities and behave like frat boys. This is deemed acceptable behavior by feminists. We even see some presumably Muslims mothers thrown in the mix, no doubt for the sake of diversity and inclusion. We even gets jabs at males and whites, so it seems the target audience is low-minded SJWs.Third wave feminism is the opposite of humor. This stinker proves it. Mila Kunis is officially a has been, and Katheryn Hawn, a genuinely funny woman/actress is totally wasted in a hideously predictable role.Its becoming more and more clear that movies are intentionally dumbed-down these days, I can't believe a writer would intentionally write such a pile of excrement."
" Nearly.
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,3,"Hangover writers know guys. End of their list from this attempt to lay lads'behaviour over moms. Mothers behaving badly need writers who know how to write girly dirty but tight. Frustratingly, everything good was in place with a great cast and production. But the material gets a big fat ""C"". For big fat clichÃ©s. Plus suspension of disbelief gets a workout. Main husband provides glossy house but too big a stretch to imagine him having any business success, let alone a mid-life crisis car. Martha Stewart handing out jelly shots, fbombs at PTA's and non-mom sex jokes. It makes it all cross between a frat house loser party and Sex In The City except in the suburbs."
" Good Lols (No Spoilers!!!)
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,7,"Mila and Christina both put their best foot forward in this hilarious movie about parenthood in the burbs. There are a few explicit references, so it's not what I'd call a ""family oriented film,"" but it was a great Mom's Night Out movie. We all had a great laugh. A few of the more serious parts *do* emphasize the importance of standing up for yourself rather than allowing bullies to wear you down, but the message is surrounded by wonderful humor and by a ""grace under fire"" attitude that we all try to muster when the chips are down.If you haven't seen this one in the theaters, Netflix it and enjoy!"
" Very disappointing..
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,3,"You can almost imagine the writers thought "" hey lets do Bridesmaids but with Moms Vs the PTA"". The words zeitgeist and groundbreaking probably sprung to mind as they then proceeded to write a story so lacking in empathy and real emotion that I found myself counting the clunky placement of Jewish references. I think the problems began in casting the stunning Mila Klunis as a "" down trodden mom who is married to an under achieving child like husband. The role would have been more believable and garnered more empathy with a more realistic Mom figure. I then found myself weighing up the credibility of the other characters.. *Handsome widower- entirely one dimensional fantasy bonk Sidekicks.... *The loud one....Brassy Jewish bad ass Mom sidekick - vulgar, sex addicted alcoholic *The quiet one.....Mousy oppressed Mom Even the PTA ( baddie Moms) had the clichÃ©d group types you normally find in a teen high school comedy. The whole thing is a juddering, clunking mess of a movie that struggles to be both vulgar enough and funny enough at the right moments. The writers, both Male have taken the best ideas of Amy Schumer and plastered Mila Klunis on it. I love Mila but her performance in this was dreadful and lacked sincerity and believability. A good idea, poorly executed and badly cast."
" Funny, silly, raunchy comedy.
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,7,I don't understand all the bad reviews. This was exactly as it was advertised. All these people with their bad reviews shouldn't watch raunchy comedies because clearly it's not their thing. It was funny. It was written & directed by guys known for raunchy comedies and that's what they gave up. People need to stop taking themselves so seriously.
" Laughed out loud - silly, forgettable fun
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,8,Had low expectations but laughed out loud through with with my daughter. A fun forgettable movie. Gotta wonder at some of the reviews on here - what were people expecting? War and peace? Will be funnier to parents and people who don't have a stick up their backside. Maybe being British/Australian I'm less offended by crudity than some reviewers on here.

" Not for everyone, BUT best movie for parents
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,10,"I am a parent and husband, fans of action, thrillers, and horror movie, little hate drama. At first, this movie feels slow and long, another word of boring, I underestimated this film. But there is one thing, but then i stunned by the script or action of the players. Wow, is this one of the best movies for parents? On the other hand the rating of the film is low, so I finished watching the movie until the end to give an honest review. So yes, this movie is not suitable for some types of people, especially unmarried ones. So they are free to give any stupid review that damage this movie rating. You bastards, wait until you become parents and then watch this movie again, so you can understand what a good message to be conveyed by the author. But yes, this is one of the best movies ever made for parents, especially mothers (we all salute you, moms). Intelligent and not looking cheap, packed by a good and sharp writer, this film managed to bring up the true facts of everyday life that a mother passes through. How difficult it is to raise a child, the whole routine to be accomplished, that a mother must be perfect and flawless. A difficult and complicated world, is'n it? Are you a parent? You will never regret watching this movie."
" What movie did everybody else see?
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,9,This movie is a comedy and not a documentary on mom life. It was hilarious. I was laughing throughout the entire movie. The movie is awesome. The cast is very good. Mila Kunis is awesome. The kids aren't the annoying clichÃ© kids that so many movies have. The supporting actors and actresses are great too.
" Who's bad?
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,7,"Humor is universal they say. But some humor isn't. And comedies always will divide people. Some people will think this is hilarious, some others will call it despicable (especially with the language used in this one!). It's kind of like Sex and the City - The Mom Edition. Also boiled down a lot and simplified even more.But to be entertained you don't always need a lot. Great villains would be great (something this movie lacks, giving us stereotypical performances from the Husband and rival mom), but even that can be neglected unless you are expecting a masterpiece in comedy. That's not what you'll be getting here. You will be getting a movie that is raunchy and predictable, but with very likable main characters (our 3 friends by chance). ClichÃ©s aplenty floating your way ..."
" When mommy breaks out of the everyday routine...
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,6,"""Bad Moms"" was a movie that I was actually looking forward to getting a chance to sit down and watch because I like Mila Kunis, but also because Kathryn Hahn and Christina Applegate were starring in it.This is the type of comedy movie that you just know will not challenge your intellect, so it is just basically lean well back in the chair and enjoy the ride. I found ""Bad Moms"" to actually be better than I had anticipated it to be, so that was a good surprise.The storyline is quite simplistic really. A group of mothers are fed up with the way that they have to live their lives and perform up to the expectations of every other mother in the PTA group. This liberation leads to a much needed freedom, fun, and comedic self-indulgence.There is a lot of hilarious moments and situations throughout the course of the movie, and the comedy is served to the audience in terms of both practical and visual comedy, but also by some outrageous and funny dialogue.While Mila Kunis actually did a great job in this movie, she was just outshone by Kathryn Hahn and her performance here. The movie was so well carried by the female cast, though again I will credit most of the lifting to Kathryn Hahn.""Bad Moms"" is a very funny and entertaining movie, and if you enjoy comedies where there are little limitations. There might be situations that some people will find to be a bit too much, but hey, this is an R-rated movie.This is also the type of comedy that you can watch again, although I would say that some time should definitely pass in between such multiple viewings. This is hardly a comedy classic, but it still a very enjoyable and entertaining comedy."
" argh
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,3,"Bonus points for the slow-mo scenes which were funny ( despite being cheap comedy). I found Kirsten Bell's character and home life was probably more interesting and darker than the others, which could've been explored more. Also Applegate's character was meh though I thought she was really cool in this movie.Throughout the whole movie I kept asking myself...do people like this actually exist?"
" This is a comedy??
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,3,"One or two funny lines, but definitely not worth and hour and forty minute investment of your time. Like other reviewers have said, maybe if you are a mom with children you'll relate to it and enjoy it. Maybe even laugh more than I did (which was once). But for guys looking for a real comedy, skip it. BTW, the ""F"" word must have been used 500 times in this movie."
" Third wave feminist film.
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,1,"Let me tell you this, in this movie Mila Kunis has to be the most selfish person in this world.She, immediately cheated when she caught her husband watching live porn ( husband was sex deprived for 5 freaking years). Really !!! Is this the state of modern women?this movie portrays that not caring about children and husband is a cool thing to do.What a terrible movie."
" Don't bother watching.

I wish I had friends like that and I am a man not a woman. I don't even have children. I highly recommend this movie. I am going to go out today and buy the DVD.
" Boring chick flick
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,3,"When I watch a comedy the least I expect is that there are funny parts in it, that it gets a smile on my face every now and then. And I do think I have a good sense of humor so that can not be the problem. The problem with Bad Moms is that the humor is so childish. And without being a sexist this movie is just a chick flick. Not that women have no sense of humor, far from that, but besides an audience of female teenagers I can't see other people enjoying this movie. The story is also really lame. They try to be funny but it just doesn't work. The acting is okay though. They're clearly not the worst thing in this movie. If I gave it a three it's for Mila Kunis, who is a beautiful women. She's the only good thing about this movie."
" It's funny, joyful, and surprisingly smart amidst the unapologetic R-rated raunchiness
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,7,"Not too many can deny that being a parent is hard, but nonetheless rewarding. It is rare however, that many films thoroughly tackle the hardships of parenthood without falling the pit of mawkish sentimentality. This comedy directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Morre and written by the men behind 'The Hangover' is one of those rare entries that tackles smartly on parenthood while poking fun at the hardships of family values. This film continues on the long string of films revolving around figures who are normally expected to act as role models engage in reckless and inappropriate behavior as a means for outrageous comedic appeal. Billy Bob Thornton did this with 'Bad Santa', Cameron Diaz did this with 'Bad Teacher', Johnny Knoxville did this 'Bad Grandpa', it's an ongoing trend in the genre that never fails to pull cinephiles into theaters. Unlike these entries, this comedy pedals on this theme with something more thoughtful behind the volcanic R-rated vulgarity. This film stars Mila Kunis as Amy Mitchell, a frustrated mother who's constantly overwhelmed by taking care of her two children, holding her job at a coffee factory, attending PTA meetings hosted by a bossy PTA president Gwendolyn James (played by Christina Applegate), and being a housewife for everyone including her incompetent and unfaithful husband (played by David Walton). After an entire day gone wrong, Amy has decided she's finally had enough and forms a pact with her two friends Kiki (played Kristin Bell) and Carla (played by Kathryn Hahn) to cut down on their motherly responsibilities and party like mad. This eventually puts her under a crossfire by the PTA president.There is certainly nothing new offered beyond it's following the average raunchy comedy formula. That is definitely not to say however, that this film fails to shed on light on some thoughtful themes of parenthood in the midst of the constant stream of vulgar dialogue. The film is quite honest and understandable how difficult it is raise children while balancing your career and other responsibilities. This leaves room to some surprising heartwarming moments that come about in and out of the story. By the end, it opens the door to a message about how being a good mother does not require you to be a perfect one -- as opposed to Christina Applegate's character who showers her PTA members with a notion that perfection is the only key to successful parenthood. Surrounding the sweet substance however, is an extravagant level of raunchiness that is a staple for R-rated comedies. The three lead actresses Mila Kunis, Kathryn Hahn, and Kristen Bell indulge in a endless vulgar sex jokes and genital jokes, and run rampant on F-bombs nearly every minute they appear on screen. Most of the humor is funny and enough to evoke good laughter, there are a few jokes however that fall either fall flat or a bit distasteful. Nonetheless, these actresses blossom with some sweet chemistry and comedic appeal. Following her disastrous role in sci-fi flop 'Jupiter Ascending', this marks an surprising return for Mila Kunis in the comedic territory since her outing in Seth MacFarlane's 'Ted' back in 2012, only that movie didn't give her much of a chance of exercise her comedic talent. Christina Applegate also delivers a fair of comedic flair but perhaps not enough to stand out against the main trio.Bad Moms is a wild comedy driven with plenty of laughter and a smart, heartwarming message that places it's three lead actresses on a fun, if flawed comedic ride. Although it's not consistently funny, it at least offers a sweet taste of comedic flair that will likely please many entreating for a clever, raunchy comedic vehicle."
" Easy watching fun film
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,8,I actually thought this film was quite good. That's what some mums are like. I think those who have given it bad ratings are probably into boring slow films. It was funny my friends also enjoyed it. Watched it twice now and I would watch it again. I am sure there's times a lot of mums fell like just letting their hair down and escaping from reality.
" If you love your Mom, this is a perfect movie for you!
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,10,It is a wonderful movie if you want to laugh...more if you are a girl and miss your mom! Didn't expect to have a teaching in the end and loved it! One of my favorite movies! Recommend it 100 percent!Looking in what the movie makes you feel only and it really made me laugh the whole time! Amazing!
" Not a comedy, but a lesson!
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,7,"This is a movie that no men will understand, so ill do my best here! From my point of view this movie describes exactly what happens to the women when they give birth in 18-20 years old. I don't know much about the writers, but i assume at least one of them is from such kind of family.But overall in the movie you don't actually see that the main actors are career woman or even remotely busy all day. May be Carla is exception here, but all the other moms didn't left the feeling that they work for 40-45h a weak.Mila Kunis is a great actress, but she was not a right one for the main role here, because she don't have an ""overworked mom"" body expression.The best act in was made by Christina Applegate, hands down. Her makeup crew did fantastic job.This is a good movie, but let's say it, not a remotely close to the real life situation. But hey, that's the movies for right?"
" Kunis may be the new Aniston...
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,"(I have to admit something upfront. I am utterly in love with Mila Kunis and Katherine Hahn. So this is going to be biased, but I have good reason!) First off, both of these gals (and of course Bell, Applegate and Pinkett Smith) have stellar varied track records and are welcome familiar faces. Whether they're all supporting anchor men, fighting the Matrix for Zion, smoking weed with friends, or ruling the corporate consulting market, they have always held up others with their on screen support as costars. Well now it's the ladies turn and all I can say is good lord; why aren't they in leading roles more often?! Kunis is a knockout in this. A recently singled mother trying to balance her millennial filled work with her family, she befriends several other mothers who span the spectrum between married pushover to serial bar hag. Amy (Kunis) is somewhere in the between as a down to earth parent who's just had enough, whether it's dealing with a deadbeat husband, an overbearing school body, or a naÃ¯ve hipster boss. When she's not trying to find her pacing on her own, slapstick, faux pas, and awkward social attempts occur. But never once do you feel like she's faking it. When she laughs, you laugh. When she's in pain, it hurts. When she's betrayed, you just want to beat the sh*t out of the person who wronged her! And getting hot coffee in your face is never fun. I don't know if they were actually drunk during those scenes, but there are some lushes afoot.The ladies mesh the best when they're all on screen together. Usually this is accompanied by heavy drinking (girls' night out style drinking, NOT self-medicating alcoholism) or bonding in their respective social clicks. This may sound clichÃ© as some reviewers have stated, but I want to point something out. They're not doing it for the sole purpose a male's affections. There is a love interest in this movie with Amy, but it's never the A plot, only a minor B or C story line. The main grab is Amy trying to get her life back on track while taking on Gwendolyn (Applegate) as the president of the parent school body after her children were deemed unacceptable for the school's extracurricular activities. The overarching story line is not being a bad mom, but simply taking a moment for themselves so they don't actually turn into terrible parents. Whether this is letting a kid do their own studying, preparing lunches and actively participating in school activities, or standing up to a spouse to take on more responsibility, the women are trying to set their lives a little straighter. And if that sounds TRITE to you, get a better outlook on self-improvement, and a sense of humor.The pacing is great in this movie as there's an exhaustive mix of comedy, empathy, struggle, drama and catharsis. In the beginning, it's like one big giant .gif train of slow-mo party shots. Again, there's a lot of slapstick in this. If you like movies such as Forgetting Sarah Marshall (another flick with Kunis and Bell!), Knocked Up, or self-indulgent mom humor, you'll get a big kick out of this flick. The second one just got announced for this winter (2017), I cannot wait. And Mila Kunis is of course gorgeous."
" Bad to the bone.
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,8,"Helping out a friend who is ill,I felt that a Comedy might cheer her up a bit. Making a note of the title after sadly missing it at cinemas,I was pleased to see that it has now come out on DVD,which led to me finally finding out how bad these moms could be.The plot:From the moment she gets up, Amy Mitchell takes a hands-on approach at her kids schools, (with PTA head of the school Gwendolyn James always looking down on her)and uses any spare time to work at a hip coffee shop. Feeling their marriage is in trouble,Amy goes to talk to Mike,and finds him having internet sex with a Camgirl he has known for 10 months.Kicking Mike out,Amy soon closes paths with fellow mums Carla and Kiki,who join Amy in becoming tearing up their nice image,and becoming hard-rocking bad mums.View on the film:Making the film when pregnant with her second child, Mila Kunis gives a sparkling performances as Amy,who is given a raunchy sass by Kunis that is balanced by a sweet thoughtfulness for her family. Joining Amy on wild nights out, Kathryn Hahn and Kristen Bell give hilarious performances as Carla and Kiki,with Bell keeping Kiki buttoned up,and Hahn jumping into the slap-stick and letting Carla's hair down. Hissing at the rebels, Christina Applegate gives a wicked boo-hiss performance as busybody Gwendolyn. Splattering the tasks on Amy's plate across the screen,co- writers/co-directors Jon Lucas & Scott Moore and cinematographer Jim Denault give the physical comedy a brash,slap-stick atmosphere,hit with stylish slow-mo which brings to focus the wild partying moments of the bad moms. Backed by an awesome soundtrack which includes Janelle MonÃ¡e,the directors keep close to the group and elegantly express the bond they have.Watching Amy catch her husband when he really needs to clean his internet history,the screenplay by Moore and Lucas packs the film with risquÃ© charms, spilling from the women going on a late night shopping spree,to Amy treading on Gwendolyn's stuck-up heels. Whilst breaking out the laughs when the women let their hair down,the writers give the punchlines a personal quality,with Amy's change in outlook helping to create a closer relationship with her children,as the bad mums put the bad boys in the shade."
" This single man absolutely loved it hilarious
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,8,I have to say that I can be quite entertained by the humor in some movies and this is one of those movies I laughed out loud several times I found it to be just right for me yea I know that I am not the target audience but I loved it Kiki had me laughing out loud every time she was in a scene I say go rent a copy of this movie it's wonderful good for moms and dads alike who feel they underachieve in life but the kids love them anyway this is for all the normal parents out there who don't have to achieve in everything in life it's wonderful to watch and laugh along with the movie about life situations just please KEEP THE KIDS UNDER 15 OUT OF THE THEATER because it is simply not for them aside from that it was wonderful
" Female liberation is all about getting drunk and penises.
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,1,"A terrible movie; disjointed, unfunny and insulting to both women, who are presented as puerile passive/aggressive victims, and men who are either vacuous jocks, selfish idiots and/or cyphers. The movie doesn't have an original, amusing or insightful bone in its indeterminable length. Watching this movie was like having a kidney stone.The movie made quite a profit. One can only assume it was due to the presence of the word 'bad' in it's title. Previous movies with 'bad' in their title such as Bad Santa and Bad teacher were masterpieces compared to this rubbish.Despite its faults the movie still obviously takes itself seriously. It's theme of female assertiveness is meant to be profound but is depicted in the movie by the 'bad' moms getting drunk and molesting men and generally acting like 15 year old males supposedly do as shown in broad teenage angst movies.I repeat this movie is terrible."
" Funny
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,8,"My wife rented this, otherwise I would not have thought to watch it. I must say I was pleased and have to admit this was very funny. It takes a lot to make me laugh. The writers clearly had a good story with decent character building and sub-plots to keep the movie going. It was not a predictable, typical movie. The comedy was funny in the vein of Tina Fey/Amy Pohler and I honestly thought I would be seeing that caliber of comedians. I was surprised to find Mila Kunis as the lead in this level of a comedy. Obviously having a veteran like Applegate helped, however Christina's character was not the typical leading comedic role. This actually was a nice touch, and should have given the movie higher ratings then I have seen. In fact, I am troubled by the less than stellar reviews by the users on this site. It really takes a great deal for me to provide an 8 especially for a comedy, and this movie earned it."
" Ignore the bad reviews this is a FUNNY feel good film!
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,10,"Yes I am a Mum and know how hard it can be so this film totally clicked with me. Great script, acting by all and really enjoyed it from start to finish. Lots of laughs and sweet moments :) Hope to see a Bad Moms 2 please by the writers :)Milas Kunis was brilliant in this film as were all the actors , the music also complimented the film very well and added to the fun feel good moments. Some scenes were downright hilarious but wont give it away as to not spoil the film.Give it a chance and am sure you will like it, the film made my night after recovering from being ill and was the perfect pick me up!"
" Wasn't really good
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,6,"Certain parts of the movie was comedic, but overall I would say that this supposed comedy has disappointed me. Also I find the film plot is incredibly expected and clichÃ©. This movie exaggerates on certain topics and it also touches briefly on certain sensitive topics which they had clearly meant it to be funny unfortunately I didn't find it so. Some scenes in this film are just played way too long than necessary. Plus, the saddest part to me is that I don't think that I have learned anything from this film. It is okay, slightly below average to be honest. But Mila Kunis is still as good looking as ever, so I guess that kind of makes up for the poor story progression in this movie."
" It was fun! Nothing extraordinary but fun indeed!
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,6,"If you're looking for a comedy that will make you laugh to tears, this is not the one. It's nicely made with the occasional laugh and some humor that will be appealing to parents mostly. Having said that, I really enjoyed this movie! Especially Kathryn Hahn was awesome in her role. I think that her character was the most interesting in the entire movie. Christina Applegate was also really really good!I enjoyed the part in the end of the movie where the main cast members talk together with their mothers. This part was really sweet and it's worth watching. Although the movie greatly exaggerates the life of a working mom, it does so in order to point out specific aspects of our behavior and it does a decent job as far as I am concerned. It's a nice movie for a relaxed evening at home. Nothing more, nothing less."
" I laughed 'till I cried, all the way through!
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,10,"Definitely the funniest movie I've seen in a long, long time. The chemistry between Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn was an absolute delight to watch.The narrative moves forward at quite a clip, and I'm pretty sure I laughed non stop through the entire film. ""Bad Moms"" is almost a textbook example of how to write a comedy.You'll want to own this, and I promise you'll be watching this again and soon. I'm already planning a double feature with ""Bad Santa.""""Bad Moms'' is a great comedy, so make sure you don't listen to the anal retentive types who panned it.......and DON'T MISS IT!"
" Not funny enough for a comedy, but not awful either..
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,6,"'Bad Moms' is written and directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, most known for the writing of 'The Hangover'. This sounds promising but on the other hand, unfortunately, they've written movies like '21 & Over' and 'The Change-Up'. 'Bad Moms' is more similar to the latter two than it is to 'The Hangover'. The movie follows protagonist Amy (Mila Kunis), who's the very busy, young mother of two middle school kids. She's married to the father of the two children. He's basically worthless as a partner and a father and consequently she has to take on a huge work load which turns her life arduous. When she meets two other moms, played by Kathryn Hahn and Kirsten Bell, Amy decides to change her habits and starts letting herself come first for a change.'Bad Mom's is a silly comedy, with some flat and annoying characters. It gets very difficult to like anyone in this movie, besides Mila Kunis, who tries to make this movie work. Every character is larger than life and fits at least a couple of stereotypes. This stereotypical representation of the characters reminded of a bad high school movie, which it actually was, with the difference that the characters are all at least 10 years older. The movie does point out some of the difficulties of being a mom, and how hard it is nowadays to fit the norm of the 'perfect' mom. This makes you care more about the main protagonist in the story, and make you root for her. The other two moms that Amy befriends don't get a lot of introduction or background, and are thus very two-dimensional.A comedy needs to be funny and actually, this movie was able to come up with a couple of funny moments. There are a lot of comedies out there that fail completely at being funny and are therefore boring as hell. This movie isn't one of these comedies, but is however still not funny enough for it to be an enjoyable comedy, and I did get bored at times. There are some characters that are meant to be funny but turn out be nothing but silly and unlikable. If it wasn't for these couple of funny scenes and funny puns, and a committed Mila Kunis, this movie could have been an awful, boring comedy. Now, this doesn't mean we need more of these movies. Unfortunately, Hollywood didn't get this and a sequel has been announced for 2017.PS: If you haven't finished season 5 of Game of Thrones and you're still planning to, don't watch this movie. A major spoiler is revealed for the sake of a joke. The joke wasn't worth it."
" A waste of time
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,4,"I just got an incredible urge to write my first review after watching this movie, cause i expected this to be at least half decent but this was such a waste of time and talent. I like most of Mila Kunis movies but i wouldn't recommend this garbage to anyone.The jokes are just as crappy as the acting. Sure it got a few chuckle moments and Applegate is OK as the evil b**ch but that's about it. Best moment in the movie would be in the credits, when the actresses doing interviews with their real moms, funnier then this whole movie altogether, not worth waiting for that moment tho. Just fast forward, or even better, push the off button.I rarely rate movies lower then 5 cause i usually find some enjoyment in them, but there's not much to find here. A little plus for the end credits stuff."
