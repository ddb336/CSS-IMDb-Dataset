" Flashy and fun
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,7,"Everyone loved The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, so it was no small wonder that everyone flocked to see the sequel when it came out a few years later. With a return from (almost) everyone in the original cast, it's delightful to pick up where it left off. Judi Dench and Bill Nighy are enjoying their new life together, Maggie Smith is helping to run the hotel with Dev Patel, Celia Imrie is still a single playgirl, and Ronald Pickup and Diana Hardcastle are living together like teenagers. But as Dev and Tina Desai plan their large, traditional Indian wedding and face off against their mothers-in-law, two unexpected guests throw a wrench in things.Although Penelope Wilton ""turned left"" at the end of the first movie, she's returned! It's not really necessary to the plot, but we'd all miss her if she didn't come back, right? And at last, the hotel guest that brought us all to the theaters: Richard Gere! We're all going to pretend he hasn't reached the age where he could join a senior center (and let's face it, he hasn't), and just enjoy the fact that he's in this movie pitting all the ladies against each other as they vie for his attention.Like most sequels, it isn't as good as the original. It's still very entertaining, but it mostly felt like everyone just wanted to make another movie together (and let's face it, they did) than to further the plot and create another meaningful story. And as light and fun as this one is, complete with a wedding and flashy dances, keep in mind the drama of the first movie. If there's a third movie, it'll have a bit of ""...and then there were eight"" feeling to it. But no spoilers here."

" ""Disappointing and Predictable""
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,4,"Typical of sequels, not much to say in terms of storyline. What was the point, only to ""Enter...Richard Gere""
The old cast are uninspiring with regards to the plot...
The Indian cast aren't what you would call professional. I d8d mot enjoy this movie at all. In-fact I switched over mid-view...
Thumbs down I'm afraid ðŸ‘Ž"
" This film has a very special place in my heart.
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,9,"Just like the first film, this one also takes you to a very special journey you can never forget. The honesty of the characters and how relatable they are is what made the first film so charming and unique applies to this film too.These two films have a very special place in my heart.Would I watch it again? Absolutely! Would I make my friends watch it? Definitely."
" A lovely watch again.
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,7,"While it's not a good as the first, the story is different and the characters are in different places. It's still worth a watch and just like the first, it made me cry. The ending to this is worth watching the whole thing for. Well done Maggie Smith"
" Great Cast; Mediocre Film.
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,5,The Second Mediocre Exotic Marigold Hotel(5.5/10)
" Enjoyable
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,8,"Good and enjoyable film but a great pity about the overloud ""music"". Why do sound people have to barge in and take over? They push their ""music"" so loud that it is impossible to hear the dialogue."
" Very poor direction
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,3,"The cast is amazing, the writing is good as is the photography and the art direction. But what let's this movie down in a huge way is the direction. The plot does not emerge until the movie is halfway through. Scenes just appear with random characters for no apparent reason. I had recently watched the original which was wonderful so arguably the main players did not need much character building. But - in a massive lost opportunity - I did not care about these characters at all."
" Some work is needed on the viewer's part to enjoy this ambling retirement tale
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,4,"Silver haired national treasures Dames Maggie Smith and Judi Dench, along with Bill Nighy and Celia Imrie have reunited for the creatively named The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.Firm friends from the first film, Sonny (Dev Patel) and Muriel (Smith) embark on a new business venture - a second hotel which Sonny is trying to finance while Muriel steps in as the hotel manager.
The plot is basically a collection of precarious pairings as each resident (new and old) navigate stop-start relationships against the back-drop of Sonny's pressure-cooked expansionist goals.Richard Gere's character another creative name-'Guy') has been inserted in a patronising attempt to inject a lustful dynamic but it's Patel who, despite his appearance being downplayed in favour of his more established cast mates, carries the sequel, as he did in the original, with charm and maturity.Whether you're this film's target demographic or you're a younger party dragged along, two hours in the company of this cast is more than pleasant.
You'll only get a few one-line zingers (all from Maggie) and a handful of breathtaking vistas so don't expect to be carried along - some work is needed on the viewer's part to enjoy this ambling retirement tale."
" JUST GET INTO THE GAME
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,10,"Sonny (Dev Patel) and Muriel Donnelly (Maggie Smith) are attempting to franchise with a second hotel, as their first one in constantly booked. The parent company says they will send a surprise inspector. When Richard Gere shows up, Sonny knows it is him. Like the first film, this one has enough characters and subplots to keep one from getting bored.The film starts out a little slow, but kicks into gear at about an hour or so. For us older folks it was a heart warming film knowing that life can begin again at 80. It is hard to to love a Bollywood ending. Not as good as the first one, but still a pleasure."
" This movie is in need of periodic sequels
",2019-05-09 00:00:00,10,"Just imagine this perfect and exotic environment of mixed colors, sounds, life philosophy and life events as an excuse where great artists who are now Seniors can perform for the delight of the viewers and for a future remembering of their actor perfume to our life's. I will not mention a list of actors because any attempt from this point of view it would be fruitless. But almost all of us would be delighted to see once more actors who step aside. We miss them ! And we should not forget that actors has the moral duty to die on the stage, in the Marigold Hotel, what an exit wooooo !"
" Beautiful movie with everything in it
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,10,"I watched the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel a while back. That was a beautiful movie. Then I found that they had made the 2nd movie. So I watched. From beginning to the end it was so nice. It had fun, excitement, romance, simplicity and all. At the end I was very sad when it was time for Mrs. Donnelly to return back to her cold cold England. Great movie. I wish they brought more movies like this."
" Smith carries the day
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,6,"The sequel to ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" (2012) continues with the various stories of British seniors living in the titular hotel in Jaipur, India . The story also focuses on Sonny (Dev Patel), the proprietor who has ambitions to expand the hotel as he is also preparing to get married.Like the earlier film, this one is blessed with a seasoned cast particularly ""the great dames"", Maggie Smith and Judi Dench.Dench does well with her role as expected but one is left with a desire to have seen her in a better role with more time on screen. Luckily, Smith fits the bill on both of those fronts. She and Patel are the main highlights of the film especially as an unlikely pair on a business venture at the film's beginning. Patel is quite funny as someone whose ambitions are so high that he seems to have been born with caffeine in his blood.There is much humour in the beginning with sharp lines delivered with flair. The film spends too much time, however, with romance in too many sub-plots. It seems that Cupid is the invisible character in this movie shooting his arrows left, right and centre - sometimes with an attached note that reads, ""Hey, you're not getting any younger."" The romantic conclusions often seem trite with little depth.There is a genuine feeling of joy that accompanies a celebration in the second half but the film's main strength is Smith - not only because of who she is but her character has the good fortune of deflecting Cupid's storm of arrows and showing that there is more to life than just romance."
" Great but.......
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,9,"It's a great sequel to the original.
My biggest gripe is when Evelyn (Judi Dench) travels from Jaipur to Mumbai in a non air conditioned unreserved carriage. I live in India and have done that journey. Its nearly 16 hours!! She would at least been in a sleeper."
" Touchy lines
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,8,Nice movie. although part one was way more than this.
" A return trip, with a different view
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,8,"Less funny than the first, but just as enjoyable, a duo of films I never expected to relate to and engage with, yet much wisdom appears with the depth of characters that relate to us all. Easy watching, smile filled and great writing!"
" i love it
",2018-04-13 00:00:00,10,I cant say enough good things about this movie. i hope they make another one so we can see what happens to all the characters i have fallen in love with.
" Dead Horse well and truly flogged
",2018-03-20 00:00:00,4,"First movie was great - this somehow has lost its way and comes across as hollow, trite and just out to screw the audiences out of another buck.Shame on the producers - this type of film is a one off.
A sequel should never have been made but greed wins out as usual as does artistic integrity.This was truly awful and a mere shadow of the excellent original film!"
" I agree with others - Second Best is a descriptive title.
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,3,"The original was good. The ""Second Best"" - forget it. Too much time wasted in Bollywood dance scenes. Sonny putting up with Sunaina's antics was disgusting. Her prima-donna, shove my ex-boyfriend in my future husband's face, attitude is something no one entering marriage should have to put up with. Of course, I'm old fashioned about marriage, believing that couples should always strive to support and build each other up."
" Too goody and fake formula
",2018-01-30 00:00:00,4,"With a top cast, the whole thing was charming but oh so formula and goody. I lost interest in the characters mid-way and could not go back. The subject matter seemed so artificially pumping up India for old people. I couldn't imagine any of these people genuinely interested in living in India."
" Checking in again
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,4,"The sequel lacks the charm of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, with a plot that seems to be cobbled up together like it is a greatest hits package and Sonny (Dev Patel) the wide eyed hotel entrepreneur being even more irritating.Luckily Jaipur is picture pretty, the British pensioners from the first movie are still alive and joined by others.The main interest is between Douglas (Bill Nighy) who is a local tour guide and his blossoming relationship with Evelyn (Judi Dench) who works as fabric buyer. Things threaten to take a turn for the worse when Douglas's bitter wife turns up and asks for a divorce.Muriel (Maggie Smith) is now the co manager of the hotel and she and Sonny are looking for investors for The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Sonny also has his wedding to prepare for and a rival who purchases the property he is interested in.Even worse, a writer arrives at the hotel Guy Chambers (Richard Gere) who Sonny is convinced is the hotel inspector sent from the USA, Chambers takes an unhealthy interest in his mother.The film was just a bit too long and lacked the resonance and emotion of the first film. At least it ends on a Bollywood note."
" A great movie that one needs some life experience to appreciate
",2017-10-28 00:00:00,9,"I'm sorry but this movie may not be suitable for younger audiences (under 20s), not due to any scene in particular but because of its story line which might only be fully understandable for those who have lived a little.We have some moments in life when we look back and think about where we are from and where we are going, and this movie is telling us that it is never too late to live, to embrace a new story and life itself.Maggie Smith 'steals' the whole spotlight whenever she is on screen, a wonderful performance with typical British humor and sarcasm which I have always enjoyed; Judi Dench plays her character brilliantly and Bill Nighy embraced his character in the most natural way I have ever seen. It may be a little too Bollywood for my own personal taste (that is why I didn't gave it a 10 out of 10) but all in all I didn't notice the time passing by, I have thoroughly enjoyed the story, and it made me think a little about my own life as well."
" Already looking forward to another sequel!
",2017-10-03 00:00:00,7,"Dev Patel's career has matured over his Indian trilogy, starting with Slumdog Millionaire, and then the two Exotic Marigold Hotels, and then Lion. Ironically the Indian Patel clan own thousands of hotels across the USA, so not sure if it's a coincidence or not. ""A Patel Motel Cartel?"" is an insightful NYT magazine article published on 4 July 1999 (Independence Day!) and written by Oxford graduate Tunku Varadarajan.This is a charming sequel, and Richard Gere is Richard Gere, suave and appealing to the audience. Jai ho! Bill Nighy is Bill Nighy, fantastic, and I remember first seeing him in the mini-series The Men's Room back in the 90s. Actually, Bill's wife Diana Quick has Indian ancestors.The ending has a dance scene (what else?) just as Slumdog Millionaire ended.I would love to see a sequel, but the director has said this is unlikely because the actors are getting on in their years. Perhaps there should be a reboot with a younger stellar cast that brings together actors needing a comeback."
" May be second best, at the same time it's hardly second rate
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,6,"Considering how great the first film was, 'The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel' had a lot to live up to. Despite the mixed reviews, the cast are such a talented one and it did look interesting. Did also question the point initially and, considering that sequels with a few exceptions rarely are as good or better than their predecessors, expectations were sort of mixed.Finally seeing 'The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel', it was moderately enjoyable but with a fair share of faults so was a disappointment compared to its predecessor. Not as bad as some reviewers have made out, but it could have been much better and the complaints/criticisms are understandable and legitimate from personal opinion.Starting with 'The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel's' faults, it does get off to a slow start with the first half an hour taking too long to get going. There are also too many subplots, some of them not developed enough, slow the film down and are a little too contrived-ly written.Not all the cast work this time either. Dev Patel and Tamsin Grieg are annoying, but worst of all is an out of place Richard Gere who is very wooden as a character that was better left out. A little too heavy on the clichÃ©s too, with not enough done to make them interesting.However, 'The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel' looks absolutely splendid. It's gorgeously filmed and the scenery is to die for. As is the lovely and authentic in flavour music.Parts of the script do work well, though the first film achieved a better balance of funny comedy and heartfelt drama. There are some heart-warming life lessons, some funny witty moments, uplifting warmth and cosy charm. The story is problematic, being a bit slow going in places and bloated, but does boast enough heart and charm, the ending is very touching.Of the talented cast, the standouts are the always good Maggie Smith and Judi Dench. Bill Nighy is a lot of fun too as is Celia Imrie, Ronald Pickup similarly charms. One does miss Tom Wilkinson however.In summary, second best but not second rate. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
