" jason segel is different and great!
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,7,"If a dialog-driven movie a la Richard Linklater sounds appealing to you, don't miss this one. Although I wasn't familiar with David Foster Wallace's writing, this very involving character study compelled me to seek out other avenues into his pained mind. While the movie's very existance is a bit ironic given the writer's views on fame, it treats its subject with a piercing and appropriately compasionate eye."
" Two Incredible Actors and One Incredible Script
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,10,"I know some folks won't cotton to this film, however, it has been a long time that I have seen such dynamic work done by two incredible young actors working from a script that two many could be a cumbersome mess, however, I never felt like taking a snooze for one minute during it's 106 minutes. Honest, silences and all, there was so much chemistry going on between the two that it hardly seemed like this, basically, two character film was over before I was ready. In other words, they never wore out my welcome. Loved the film."
" A Fine Bromance
",2020-09-01 00:00:00,8,"I thin I am the only person in the Western World that has not read David Foster Wallace. This story was enlightening in that regard and even if it were not, the story of the encounter between the famed but troubled writer and the Rolling Stone reporter provided interest and insight as the forced intimacy of the two seemed like an extended session of ""plane truth"" -- the sorts of things that you tell total strangers at 30,000' because what have you got to lose?There's frivolous stuff and serious stuff and writerly jealousies and paranoias. All good. Something of a little gem, the way articles that you stumble across in The New Yorker tend to become."
" Great performances.
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,8,"One of those rare instances where it feels like you're watching two interesting, complex, real people rather than two actors pretending to be those people."
" Overrated, you may want to pass on this one.
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,4,"We watch two young men exchanging intellectual thoughts, not too bad, but no revelations. I understand why Wallace's family did not participate in the cooperation. The film is packed with product placement, David Foster Wallace would have hated that, his work being somewhat critical about consumption. Ironically, in the movie he states he does not want to be used, but obviously he can't defend himself anymore. For me, the product placement constantly reminds me that it's about making money, not honoring or getting closer to David Foster Wallace. The completely pointless post-credit scene exemplifies the movies approach: It appears intellectual and somehow like a plot twist, but actually bites only time. Pass on this."
" Sad. Serious.
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,7,"""He wants more than he has. I want precisely what he already has.""It is kind of sad type. But beautifully sad. Or not."
" Oh Boy Would Dave Have Hated This Film, Eek
",2019-08-10 00:00:00,9,"First off, this movie is one of the most sentimental things I've seen, and Dave made it very clear that one of his biggest fears was coming off as sentimental because he hated it and viewed it as a very negative thing.So, that is the first way Lipsky managed to sell Dave out after his death.Next, there are real tapes you can listen to online that feature some of the things that were said in the movie, and sadly, the movie has changed them to make them more dramatic and sentimental. For example, Dave is sitting on a couch laughing during the lines, ""and when that happens, you become unprecedently willing to examine other alternatives on how to live,"" but much to my dismay and I'm sure David's), the movie turns this into an emotional tissue-fest toward the end of the film.If the movie did that to one lines we know about, you can only imagine how much of the rest of the lines in the film were altered for sentimentality and ticket sales.One can assume this much disrespect would only happen after someone dies and surely not before.That said, I still enjoyed the movie a whole lot. I just feel bad for Dave."
" Iconic writer turned into corny bromance road trip
",2019-07-31 00:00:00,4,"Not having done my research of what the original story was (or if there even was an original story to begin with)* I sat down and watched this movie. David Foster Wallace is one of those people who have alot to say, maybe too much to say, because he's one of the few people who has anything interesting to say the way he does and so everybody wants him to say something on their show, program, magazine, whatever. Let's go from there and see where we end up, right? Make a movie about this inspiring novelist who just wrote a book the size of a brick and let's mix in a failed writer, with the same name, looking for inspiration.What I thought might be a genuinely different experience in cin√©ma, a talkie that changes talkies the way Waking Life changed animation for a 12 year old kid living in the suburbs with only a broadband at his disposal, turned out to be what the voice in my head already assumed: this is just another cash grab biopic of a famous person. Oh, but he says he doesn't wanna be famous, he says he doesn't wanna be a big movie star, he doesn't want to be the only writer to be featured in Rolling Stone, he moans about everything being recorded whilst enjoying the attention, very well knowing and forecasting that he will become the Kurt Cobain of writing: a damn commodity for people to consume, another mindset that will be turned into an accessory. Wanna be an intellectual but don't know how? Here are some snobby teenagers reciting DFW on YouTube in bite size chunks for your bite sized attention span. You won't have to think at all! Just act like him and all the bookworms will think you're kewl *wink* Okay, enough stabbing, let's get serious here.Besides the humane portrait of this writer and the comedy involved I found that the characters were completely superfluous. Young man seeks inspiration, finds an older man who has the inspiration, both men go on a trip, they have good times, they have bad times, young man doesn't learn anything because he simply doesn't have the life experience of older man. This is a very dry take on The Road Trip meets some kinda guru flick on The Dark Side of Fame I have seen dozens and dozens of times before and this is my roadblock. I would have liked this movie alot more if this story were fictionalized with a writer inspired by the mind of David Foster Wallace instead of simply drawing an audience with his name and not doing it any honor. He's a writer that has influenced many people of my generation, Gen Y and Gen Z** and honestly, if you can't produce or direct a movie that honors this person's work, you are disrespecting that person. The cherry here is that David's being played by THE GUY that is being typecast for bromance flicks, which only emphasizes the selling point of this film. There's no sad ending, because the other David - played by an actor who is often being typecast for being the other dude in the room - never put any effort in contacting David back. There's no remorse, no sadness, to feel bad about their break-up. They simply just had a fun time for what was supposed to be an interview. Two dudes smoking, talking, watching TV and buying a  ton of junk food. It doesn't live up to anything. Nothing. And that's not what David Foster Wallace wrote about and that's not what we should remember him for.Again: I wouldn't call this a bad film necessarily for only missing the trope it's built on, a trope is simply an instrument to generate a story. I wouldn't call this movie bad because there's not enough drama. I would call this a bad film because I'm quite sure these kind of stories simply don't belong on a screen. Americans simply don't how to make a film that feels natural like Chinese movies often excel at. This is a clear example of the book being better than the film, unless the other David is still a terrible writer.*Even though the credits mention the book this movie was based on
** I'm technically a Millennial (Gen Y) but this term is confusing to most people. Basically, Millennials are people who became adults after 2000. Also, Gen Z is quite inspired by the same ideas but have other methods, which shouldn't be part of this review."
" Another review written on the toilet...
",2019-06-07 00:00:00,10,"I only leave reviews while on the toilet because that means that what I had recently viewed was truly captivating to the degree I ignore urges to use the restroom until after the credits appear.To be honest, I wasn't caught off guard or pleasantly surprised. This movie has been highly recommended by everyone I've talked to about it so I actually expected what I saw but I can state now that I was moved in other ways than what I expected. I felt like through the dialogue spoken in the film, there was a underlying reassurance that humanity is extremely independent and personal to what is encouraged or observed as. I was reminded what it feels like to long to be accepted or wanted but simultaneously being taught through Dave foster that pretentiousness only fuels more of that empty thirst that is never quenched. I was also taught about how difficult it can be to know who you are and what you're comfortable with instead of depending on the world to lay it out for you. I was left with swirling thoughts and a drive to remain reminded, so to speak, about how important it is to not allow everything around you bombard your inner understanding of who you are. Overall, the movie was delivered so beautifully but yet, so raw to the point that I felt I was with these two men, listening in on their continual discussion. I can tell that Segal put his soul into this film and provided all of us with a passionate portrayal of a type of human being that we all keep locked within ourself, a part of us that deserves more attention and freedom to exist. Bravo to everyone involved in the production of this film."
" So OK - if you're not super bright and have never read a challenging book in your life - you might not get it.
",2019-04-04 00:00:00,10,"Listen - the source material for this movie and the movie itself are brilliant.
The book is called ""Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself"" if you see that and shrugged - don't watch the movie.
If you read that and said: ""hey - that is paraphrasing Nietzsche"" then watch the movie.
Sorry to be brutal but if I can save one less than clever person from wasting his time and writing a review that simply states ""i don't get it..."" then my time will have been well-spent.
For all you AP Lit drones - this is your filmHint: the Nietzsche is the Gay Science Aph 270"
" Meh
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,3,"When you leave out all the abuse and dysfunction, you are left with a narcissistic bore."
" Best dialogue I've seen in a while!
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,8,"Jessie Eisenberg and Jason Segel are a perfect duo in this short biography.
The dialogue in this film keeps me attached every second . I knew this film would be very different at the start. It's not like most movies, it's very real and low key gritty at some points but it shows a story of a real life man living threw a calmedsome sort of celebrity status that he's not comfortable with. They begin a bond that you don't see in many films. Jessie is doing his job but also foreseeing that he is just a man with extraordinary talent and he can't seem to comprehend it. Nonetheless it's a great film with amazing cinematography. Definitely recommend this , even though I know nothing about the original David Foster Wallace."
" A Cool Movie
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,6,My Rating : 6/10Jason Segel is David Foster Wallace.A cool cucumber. 6/10
" A Real Guy
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,8,"The thing I most enjoyed about this movie was that it appears to portray David Foster Wallace as he really was, a real, normal, regular guy. I've never read any of his work so I don't know how much of a genius he may or may not be, but everyone wants great writers to be like geniuses, not regular people. It's more exciting, alluring, and sexy. David knew this and hated this tendency of people. He knew that even if he was just behaving like himself, people would see it as an attempt from him at trying to appear like a regular guy, like he just pretends to be, when really he is a genius holding back. The fact however is that it is not an act. His realness is real and he wishes people knew that, that he wasn't acting or putting on. The realness of it, not the fiction, not the spin, not the story, or the scoop. Not so that he can prove some existential point but because it matters to him to connect with people. What matters is to connect with someone, to love them, to do something kind for them, to talk with and be close to them. This is what's good, this is what matters. Not so that others can see how good of a guy you are and how loving you are. It's better to not have anyone see you love someone, so that way the only thing you have is the goodness felt with that person, that pure unadulterated goodness."
" So interesting and true.
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,9,"This movie really captured what David Foster Wallace stood for, its not flashy and easy entertainment but deep and interesting content to get great meaning from. The conversations are two great minds sharing an insight into the mind of creative minds growing up in a world of consumption. If you like thinking about society, people, and another perspective on life this movie is amazing, but if you are looking for the next die hard or another pointless actionmovie this is not for you."
" Compelling Performances
",2018-08-02 00:00:00,7,"I don't think you can enjoy this picture unless you enjoy intellectual banter, because that's mostly what it is. You don't have to agree with the world view of these characters, but you must at least enjoy being part of a deep conversation.
I'm not familiar with the real life version of either guy, so I couldn't tell if these actors were interpreting them well. But that didn't matter. They played the characters of tortured new celebrity and younger upstart with genuine grace.
 If you've ever spent a whole night or a weekend inside another person's head, while they are inside yours, you know it can be exhausting and irritating. At times these characters became exactly that to each other and to the viewer. It's based on truth, and I don't doubt that that's what happened. It's inevitable. 
Given what it was, the film utilizes some decent photography of a snowy Midwest, and good use of amicable side characters who seem to be grateful yet baffled visitors to ""Planet Writer.""
 But what's ultimately saddening about it all, is that our main character is basically a useless, self-hating loser, and he knows it. His writing is self-indulgent and dark, and from what I've heard, doesn't alleviate anyone's doubts about the world. Surely not his own. 
Sure there is value in writing to entertain others or even to stir their thoughts, but if your writing causes them to lose hope, it may not be worth it. It wasn't for him."
" Great Performances
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,7,I loved the performances but Wallace doesn't come across as someone I could spend 2 hours with never alone accompany on a world tour! (viewed 9/16)
" Everything Will Be OK.....
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,9,"The obvious of ""The End Of The Tour"" are that, obvious. The free and minimalist presentation, the undoubtedly raw and personal direction/performances, and the mesmerising screenplay which glides as easily as it does challenge. But the most fascinating part of ""The End Of The Tour"" is it's need to provoke. How am I in this world and can I control it? What is it to be alone? What is it to be successful? How is one satisfied? Just some of the thoughts that flowed through me with ease. It was almost like I knew the answer to these, but I had no sense of what these truly mean. Is there an answer to the human condition? To being, well, happy. Maybe to be happy is to be blind, because ultimately when one has an idea of the delusion they simply cannot function without forgetting this. It's almost near impossible to use this to your advantage. It's like to feel alone, is recognising what you don't have and lamenting on this. How to act. How to be. How to respond. How to live. Your mind wonders. Maybe it's better to not get what you want. In many ways, Foster Wallace wanted Lipsky's ability to freely function, and Lipsky wanted Foster Wallace's acclaim, or understanding of his ability. Would this soon turn into an endless cycle if these manifested into reality? Tricky. In saying this, these ideas are filled with self discovery. Almost hoping for you to celebrate you. I felt honoured to feel present with these people as they delve into these ideas. It made me feel like I had someone to talk to, to discus my own personal ideals with. The film is wrapped in an unbreakable gaze and is, to me, something I will cherish. Something in many ways that is beautiful and something I highly recommend."
" Two strangers become real friends
",2017-12-30 00:00:00,10,"Two men spend time together, ostensibly for business, but each with ulterior motives which are revealed as the story progresses. The two men are David Lipsky, a reporter for Rolling Stone, and David Wallace, a writer who just wrote a critically acclaimed novel. The tension mounts as both men try to gain dominance over the other. In this case the domination is not physical but intellectual and emotional. Each call out the other's failings, fears and hypocrisy. Both become enmeshed in each other's business. Lipsky finds himself answering as many questions as he asks as Wallace finds himself going on the defensive to avoid having to deal with subjects that to him are too personal and off-bounds. Yet, defensive barriers crumble and both men are able to speak to each other with a frankness that is evidence of real friendship. This is a wonderful movie."
" More than your average biopic
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,7,"I was hesitant about this movie. Because I love DFW's writing. Because his estate regarded the book and film as exploitation. Because Jason Siegel (?). But I found myself drawn in quickly. A.O. Scott commented that this film was less biopic than reflection/meditation on celebrity. Gotta say that I agree. The audience very quickly finds itself grappling with who we want to be and why. I think Wallace would like that. It is a talk-y film, but all the talking works. If I'm gonna drive around the Midwest, these two writers are good company."
" ""The End of the Tour"": Writing. It ain't for The Weak, buddy
",2017-09-09 00:00:00,7,"I am a writer. Not trying to come off as boastful. Grab a pen and a piece of paper. Jot something down. Voila. You're now a writer, too.The fact that I write-and sometimes even get published beyond these flick reviews I love composing for all of you ENORMOUSLY valued readers-is the main reason I liked ""The End of the Tour"". At it's core this is a rumination about the sensibility and soul of a writer. The drive. The pride. The fragility. The insecurity. The recognition. The failure. The hurt. All of these deeply felt emotions are explored and candidly brought to bare in this based on actual events chronicle of a nearly week-long 1996 interview between ROLLING STONE writer David Lipsky and gifted but painfully troubled author David Foster Wallace.A couple of things to be aware of when considering this film. You better be at least a moderate fan of both Jesse Eisenberg and Jason Segel, who play Lipsky and Wallace, respectively. Because every scene we see has either one or both of these guys in it.And you also best be a fan of dialogue. Man, is there a lot of it in this screenplay by Donald Margulies. Which makes sense, actually, as this account revolves almost exclusively around words, both written and spoken.We see the two main characters walking and talking. Sitting and talking. Lying down and talking. Driving and talking. Flying and talking. And here's the thing. Most of what we are listening to is pretty f-----g fascinating. At least it was to me.""The End of the Tour"" is a double entendre for a book promotion junket as well as something much more precious. If you don't know what I'm referring to already, I'm not gonna spoil it for you.I'll let the movie tell the story."
" The End of the Tour is NOT ""Brilliant"", NOT ""Top Notch"", NOT ""Superb"", NOT ""Near-Perfect. It IS kind of boring.
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,3,"The End of the Tour is NOT ""Brilliant"", NOT ""Top Notch"", NOT ""Superb"", NOT ""Near-Perfect. It IS kind of boring.The End of the Tour appears to have been filmed as cheaply and quickly as possible. The characters, dialog and story are dull and contrived but try to sound deep and intellectual. They're not. The writing seems to have nothing to say so they throw in some highbrow vocabulary to make the viewer feel like they're not smart enough to get it. ""So he must've said something really smart, right?"" Not really. If you pause the film and look up a word you quickly realize the statement was not enlightening or thought provoking at all (even though Jesse Eisenberg gave that subtle shake of the head as though he was just blown away).So why did it get so much praise? It's a vehicle for pretentious posers to rave about on their quest to appear like social butterflies of the intellectual world.It's truly shameful that society has sunk to this level. By that I mean that people we all know get their opinions from watching others on TV instead of using their own critical thinking skills. The talking heads on TV generally are speaking out opinions written for them by skewed producers or film industry marketers. This happens because the producer or critic doesn't have time to write a review on their own. They're looking for a quick way to be done with the work. Along comes the film marketeer who has taken the time to write a glowing review of the film they're trying to sell.This happens of course on the political scene as well, when organizations like ALEC write legislation for senators to pass off as their own idea.So if you decide to see this after all, do yourself the favor of making a note of who raved about it and stop taking advice from them. Also read up on the fine art of critical thinking. Calling out phonies and shaming them is the best thing we can do to change this trend of social corrosion."
" Genuine, thought provoking, human, truly wonderful.
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,9,"I hadn't read Infinite Jest, nor had I heard of either of these two people before, but something about this movie pulled me to rent it from my local Redbox. What I gathered was that this movie was a movie about dialogue, about conversation, and that it had a sense of realness to it. It seemed genuine, it seemed human, and it seemed to simply be a movie that consists of two guys talking about life. I'm so glad it was what I thought it would be.This movie speaks about loneliness, fame, depression, social strategies, perceptions, insecurities, and many other things that are ripe for honest conversation. It reminds me of great conversations that I've had with some of my friends. I went into a movie theater, sat down alone, and watched a movie that felt about as natural as if I were lying on a bed next to a friend discussing the intricacies of life. As a person who often feels great loneliness this movie really connected with me, but at the same time it made me feel like I was hanging out with these dudes and not so alone at all. Even though Lipsky was almost always recording their conversations, it still felt so natural. Especially those elusive moments where he wasn't. Those moments where it didn't feel like an interview in the slightest, it just felt like two people really opening up to each other.I found myself laughing several times during this movie, from the ""oh, you're paying?"" *grabs more goodies from the convenience store* moment to their escort around town almost condescendingly questioning his choice of outfit to a radio interview to which he replies just as I would. The humor was great and added another strong element to the formula that makes this movie so good.This movie to me is the perfect movie to watch by yourself. Put away your phone, put away what it is to be seen by anyone else, and just immerse yourself in it. Feel the humanity that is movie is made of. Be in the room with David and David. I'm really not a big reader, but this movie kind of makes me want to read Infinite Jest.The acting and cinematography were notably fantastic.This is a movie about humanity, this is a movie about loneliness. This movie is a lot of things, but at it's core it's a movie of humanity, of conversation between two people about their lives in the world we live in. Sit down, have a giant diet Rite and have a conversation with this movie. It's a conversation that is one of the best I've ever had."
" Jason Segel best interpretation
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,10,"I found a Jason Segel very profound and great in that character, Jesse it was a little bit flat, another factor against Jesse was that his character was quite annoying. Although I respect his work seems that this person cost him enough work. This movie really sells the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreading to this writer in a deeper way where his life is part of his stories. After seeing the film I came up with a need to know more about David Foster Wallace and really seems to be an author who has not popularized enough his way of thinking, despite that talk about popular culture. It is a great way to discover a great American writer who should be read especially by the young people and the culture of consuming and throwing, mental fast food."
" A philosophical delight
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"I watched this film with my friend who is a journalist and I''m a documentary filmmaker. If it wasn't so personal to us I don't know if we'd have liked it so much. The dynamic between the interviewer and the interviewee is a fascinating one. The film brilliantly explores this delicate relationship. The mutual need to gain something from the interview as well as the genuine personal human experience, are intricately woven together to shine a light on the truth of these encounters. It's all about interpretation. Handing this power over to another artist to portray you in whatever way they perceive you is a humbling display of strength. The protagonists were brilliantly cast, illustrating the brutally sad state of mind of author David Foster Wallace and the painfully keen fan David Lipsky. I devoured the philosophical teachings they gifted one another. It was a stunning film and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
