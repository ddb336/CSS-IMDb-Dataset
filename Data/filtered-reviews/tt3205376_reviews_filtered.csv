" in the shadow of Clint Eastwood
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,8,"If anyone needs extra proof that the western is a living and ever-renewing cinematic genre, then they can watch 'Slow West' (2015), the debut and the only feature film made so far by Scottish director John Maclean. It is a film that combines the idilic views of the great spaces of the road to the West from the classic American westerns with the gloomy and violent comedy of the recent productions of the Coen brothers and of Tarantino. However, the obvious model is that of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. We also deal here with an international production with an American actor in the role of the (almost) invincible cowboy. This combination, concentrated in less than 90 minutes, is perhaps the best film of its kind made in the last decade.The story is incredible, but isn't American history a mosaic of thousands of such incredible stories of adventure and discovery? Jay Cavendish (Kodi Smit-McPhee), a 16-year-old boy from a Scottish noble family, travels to America after the Civil War in search of his girlfriend and her father, both wanted by law and bounty hunters. His journey to the moving borders of Western America will be a journey of discovery of a continent full of dangers, of a nation in formation composed of a human mosaic of languages, customs and especially characters, and a path of coming to age and encounter with the violent realities of life and with the wickedness and rapacity of people. On his way he meets Sillas Selleck (Michael Fassbender), also a bounty hunter and a guy who is on the edge of the law, not clear which side, who offers to be his guide and protector to reach those they are looking for. Does he do it selflessly, or rather to get the $ 2,000 reward offered to those who will capture the father and daughter, dead or alive?It's not a typical western story, but that's how most screenplays of films of this genre made in recent decades are. Jay Cavendish matures before our eyes, learns not to trust anyone because those who seem to be the 'good guys' turn out to be crooks or even criminals and anyone who wants to survive may be forced to kill in order not to be killed. The role is played by Kodi Smit-McPhee, a young actor who has also grown up since he played the role of the child in the post-apocalyptic melodrama 'The Road' and who creates an excellent role here. Michael Fassbender (who is also the producer) plays the role of Silas with obvious pleasure, with a reverence for similar roles made by Clint Eastwood decades ago. Robbie Ryan's cinematography is superb, both in the exteriors where New Zealand disguises itself in Colorado, but also in some interiors, with many memorable frames and creative and bold filming angles. There is no lack of humor, and the gallery of secondary characters composes a mosaic of the American West populated by adventurers and crooks from all over the world. The only dissonant note was the appearance of Caren Pistorius who interprets the role of Rose, the girl after whom Jay travels the world. Her interpretation is OK, but her makeup and especially the eyebrows are very 21st century-like and contrast with the authenticity of the rest of the film. However this is a minor observation in comparison with the many good reasons why 'Slow West' deserves to be seen by fans of the western genre and not only by them."
" Slow indeed.
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,2,So boring I couldn't finish it. Can't understand why other people would like this film.
" Not Slow or Boring. Great Western.
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,8,"A24 has great films, and no I don't work anywhere near the film industry. Fassbender and Mendelsohn do not disappoint.Beautifully shot, directed, and edited.The film moves right along to fill in it's 1h24m runtime with a rich story and evolving characters. Worth anyone's time imo."
" Unique Western
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,9,"Slow West is a unique Western that's unpredictable, stylish and refreshing whilst delivering what is expected of the genre. Kodi Smit-McPhee and Michael Fassbender are both incredible with ample chemistry. Caren Pistorius and Rory McCann are great and Ben Mendelsohn is terrific. John Maclean's direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed and superbly paced. The music by Jed Kurzel is fantastic."
" Not worth the time
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,3,"It should be called slow movie , and what is up with the camera man ? And the lights this is Horrible"
" Good Western
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,10,"Enjoyed every second of this Western.
No wild western as the title also indicates.
Nice scenery (New Zealand, but who cares)"
" Very unexpected. Very enjoyable.
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,9,"Great film great characters great story.
Trailer looked pretty good but it doesn't do it justice.
It got better every minute."
" Guided by scent?
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,7,"We like westerns. This one is not bad. You have a 16 y.o. kid who's in puppy love with an older woman who says he's like her younger brother that she never had! Ouch!!! So one-way love, he loves her, she doesn't really love him. He somehow manages to know where she and father (The Hound) are hiding out in the American West despite the fact that she never told him where she was, and with a giant bounty (for those days) on the girls head and yet trained bounty hunters can't find her or dad. But some Scottish kid can just travel thousands of miles to find her across the sea and across America to go directly to her? Honestly, though, that's really the only nit-picky thing wrong about this film. It's nice to see a western landscape that's completely unfamiliar since it was filmed in New Zealand instead of the Alabama Hills or other American locations."
" Slow West, Quick Resolve
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,7,"I never thought I would hear Wes Anderson and Quentin Tarantino in the same sentence when describing a film, but I found myself making such a comment upon reaching Slow West's (2015) credit reel. Unexpectedly, Slow West seems to rewrite the western with a bit of wit, generous color grading, and a small cast whose bold performance fills the great frontier's open wilderness.Starring seeming newcomer Kodi Smit-McPhee who in all reality is no stranger to the silver screen, Slow West centers on the Jay Cavendish, son of a Scottish Lord, as he ventures into 19th century America's hopeful unknown in search of his fleeing lover Rose (Caren Pistorius). Early in his adventure, Jay encounters experienced wanderer and bounty hunter Silas (Michael Fassbender) and hires him to to be his personal guide. What unfolds is a calmly comical adventure that appears outside of time and place.Slow West best makes use of it's memorable characters and vibrant scenery. Although shot in New Zealand, the set work is open, barren, and reminiscent of the old west. If there is one thing worth noting that separates this work from other ""westerns,"" it is the film's ability to pack meaning and entertainment into a sub-90-minute package. Slow West is not an epic or a saga, but a perfectly bizarre interpretation of love without boundaries and the price men will pay in its pursuit.At the point I am writing this review, Slow West is not available outright on any streaming service but is available for purchase on Fandango and Hulu. And while not free for the general public to consume, it is worth a view if only to cleanse your cinematic pallet and offer a new perspective on a genre."
" Seriously dull and cliched
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,2,"Every American western cliche imaginable is in this movie, presented in a dull, plodding, story that does not hold together at all. Presented with all of the cynicism of a spaghetti western without any of the drama or characters of that make that genre compelling. You will know the characters if you are familiar with American westerns because this movie just borrows them from John Wayne, John Ford, and Clint Eastwood, without any of it's own development of those characters. You never really understand why anyone does anything in this movie. zzzzz."
" Another Journey thru the West
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,7,"From time to time there is still a good or excellent contribution to the good old gunning West genre. Slow West provides an old story in new clothes so to say, empowered by nice cinematography and a good acting crew (Fassbender, Pistorius etc.). In its best moments Slow West reminds me of that surreal masterpiece Dead Man (Depp, Jarmusch, 1995). Put that one on your watchlist if you like ""modern"" Western movies like True Grit (the original one like the remake), The Homesman, The Salvation or Bone Tomahawk."
" Pants
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,1,"What a slow boring film, why the hell did he shave Jay when he had a baby face . just don't bother watching this its crap with so much wrong with it, why the sniper guy didn't just kill them when they opened the door or why didn't the gang surround the house, can't believe this is getting ratings 9 +10"
" I don't get it?
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,3,"I usually appreciate a good indie film, something a bit quirky and fun with a darker, more serious side, but this one really passed me by. I only scored it so highly (3) because I think Mr Fassbender is mighty fine. However I would really like to see him playing something a bit different, less enigmatic and difficult to get close to perhaps.This story is supposed to be about a boy going to find his love and the journey he takes to get there, but nothing really happens on the way to get excited about, all the action happens at the end and it's over very quickly, with a sad finish.If Silas and Jay had fallen for each other or formed a better relationship like father and son or even brothers it might have made the film more worthwhile and given the film an actual story."
" Slow and strong western!
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,8,"It is a story about a boy from Scotland traveling to find his girlfriend. He doesn't know about the west. The film describes the west as a very cruel place full of bounty hunters. Jay, the boy, is described as the only pure boy in the west. He meets Fassbenders character who is a professional bounty hunter. Fassbender's character is bounty hunter hunting Jay's girlfriend but he is also the only one who understands Jay. He's role is connecting and putting a bridge between the cuel world of the west and the pure heart of Jay. I found this plot very interesting. The bacground which is the west was familiar but the main characters gave me a fresh feeling.
The film is very slow unlike typical western films. Basically, the plot has a structure of a road movie and by the slow tempo, the characters are expressed successfully. It may be a little boring but the ending scene is very exciting and also heartbreaking. The camera was also interesting. It felt like a Coen brother's film. Also, the humor of the film reminded me of Coen brothers or even Wes Anderson. Slow West was a very strong film and had impact. Worth watching!"
" Definitely a... different western
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,6,"I love the soundtrack. It's so great, and gives the movie it's tone. The cinematography is... different, but good. Everything is so colorful, it isn't your regular ""dusty"" western, and that's certainly a good thing, it's great to see a new take on something.The acting is awesome. All the actors are talent (and that's no surprise), so yeah... nothing out of the ordinary here.The story is... weird. Not in a totally bad way tho, I like that at the end the movie has a pace that truly takes its title seriously (it's a slow movie, you got it), so there is that. And I think I took a while to get what the movie was going for, but it has something in here, even though we don't get a lot of backstory for almost any of the characters (besides Jay), it's a different and surprisingly funny tale, of a silly boy who loved the wrong girl.There are some really weird choices all throughout for sure (like showing every single person that died in the movie at the end). But overall, it's a beautiful looking movie, with some funny moments, and talent actors. And it's not even 90 minutes long. So yeah... that should be enough to make you give it a try. Far from been perfect, but it's not bad either.6,5/10"
" interesting change of western
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,7,Great acting by fassbender. he is so versatile. Give it a watch on a rainy day.
" Incredible and hilarious
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,10,A must watch. Simple as that. The story entirely engulfs the viewer.
" SLOW COOKED TO PERFECTION
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,8,"Actually a really cool little western. Fassbender is great. Fun little bits of action between interesting little vignettes of quirky characters and lines.The cinematographic detail is superb. It really is a piece of art. The Pièce de résistance, is the soiled exposed buttock in the penultimate scene. Easily missed touches of brilliance.Not your standard western."
" Dreams and Toil!
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,7,"Back in 2009 Kodi Smit - McPhee trod a long apocalyptic road as the movie son of his guardian father Viggo Mortenson. Now in John McLean's debut feature neo-Western Slow West, he again walks and sometimes rides an equally dangerous path across the American West, this time guided and protected somewhat, by hired mysterious loner (handy with a gun) Michael Fassbender. Smit-McPhee is Jay Cavendish, a young Scotsman searching for his first love Rose Ross (Caren Pistorius) who we understand to have disappeared in mysterious circumstances from their home in the highlands. After meeting Fassbender's Silas Selleck in a darkly comic first act occurrence, indicative of the general tone of this movie, Selleck agrees to guide Cavendish through the unforgiving wilderness. But does he have alternative reasons for doing so, other than those associated with a monetary rewardSlow West is a handsome looking oater, shot in New Zealand and making great use of the rugged South Island external locations. Though not as strongly allegorical in nature and with less emphasis on the musical soundtrack, it is reminiscent of a more colourful version of Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man, in its slow-burning, unfurling of the search for the missing Rose. An assortment of interesting support characters are encounterd along the way, many of whom will prove to be obstacles in their quest to find Rose's location.In a deliberately low key film, McLean still manages to show his helming skills with a couple of fine set pieces, one at a remote trading post and another in a third act showdown at a small farmhouse surrounded by corn fields. Michael Fassbender as watchable as ever, unsurprisingly makes a very convincing thinking man's gunslinger, who may just be prepared to consider future career options. Smit-McPhee, as inferred above, is experienced in these sort of roles, even at his young age (He was around 19 at the time of filming). Caren Pistorius makes the most of her mainly third act scenes as the much sought after Rose and Ben Mendelsohn, in an underwritten part, still manages to leave a significant impression as Payne, an old compadre of Selleck's, who may now prove to be a dangerous rival.Harking back to earlier classic westerns involving long journeys, such as the The Searchers, Slow West never appears to be straining to be significant. John Maclean has made a debut Western with such confident ease that it's hard to believe the director hasn't been riding tall in the saddle for long before this film ever appeared on the trail before us."
" SHORT REVIEW
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,7,I HATE ROSEGOOD STORY BUT SLOW MOVIE. WAS NOTHING I EXPECTED.
" Fantastic, Irreverent Western!
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,7,"What more do you need than Michael Fassbender and Ben Mendelsohn in a Western film? How about great direction, cinematography, stunning landscapes, the right pace, likable characters, and a convincing plot! By the time you see this, you will regret not seeing it sooner."
" An underrated masterpiece
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,10,"A gorgeous looking, funny, heartbreaking and very sweet western with great performances from Kodi Smit-Mcphee and Michael Fassbender.One of the most underrated movies of the 2010's and one of my favorites.Did I mention this movie's gorgeous? I really love the look of this movie.And for a movie called ""Slow West"", it never felt slow to me."
" A film to enjoy films
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,8,"This movie is about the technical aspects of cinema. If you dont get it, you probably dont watch movies, you just see them."

" Slow West
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,6,"Slow West is a film directed by John Maclean and stars Kodi Smit-McPhee, Michael Fassbender and Caren Pistorius and tells the tale of a young Scottish boy traveling to the frontier to hopefully track down the love of his life with the aid of a mysterious man. Slow West is one of the more beautifully shot films I've seen in recent memory as it perfectly captures the old West whether it be on the brightly lit flat plains, shrouded and lively forests or just plain old towns which drew you into the film's realistic atmosphere. Also drawing you in were stars Kodi Smit-McPhee and Michael Fassbender whose perfectly opposed personalities and responses to certain horrific and unfortunate events allowed for good character development from both men. Slow West paints a dreary depressing and bleak Outlook of life not just as outlaws but as newcomers onto one of the worst places to live in the history of our country at least and the music matches this Outlook very nicely as well. That being said the film's story takes some particularly odd turns around the beginning of the third act with an ending that perhaps didn't punctuate what most would think that the message of the film very well and in fact punctuates a different message without much evidence to back it up. There are also certain interactions between characters in the second and third act that lead to decisions by said characters that didn't make much sense either and the overall story showed us very much what we've become accustomed to seeing in western films like these. Still though, despite the weaker story elements here, the positives do manage to outweigh the negatives here for the most part and most notably the good performances and atmosphere of the film are enough for me to recommend it to you guys."
" Excellent Early 20thC Western - Guns Indians Outlaws Love
",2020-03-10 00:00:00,9,03/10/2020 An excellent movie with a simple but well done storyline. All actors are professionals. The panoramic landscapes are beautiful. Looks like Montana or Wyoming? Definitely worth watching. Bon Appetit'
" Slowly grew on me
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,8,"This is an unusual Western (filmed in New Zealand). It indeed started very slow but it's excellent cast and intelligent, if quirky screenplay, came through and revealed a touching and sad story. Indeed the US old west, as portrayed here, and as one commentator noted, gave no quarter to the guilty or especially the innocent. At one level different, but to me, at another, oddly similar to classics such as 'Shane', 'Open Range', 'The Searchers', etc, and the bleakness of 'Unforgiven', in its depiction of the empty loneliness, cruel violence, and hardy settlers of the West. Highly recommended."
" Simple and minimilistic... In a good way
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,6,"Like I said I found the story to be simple with a minimilist style and bottom line it felt like a western because of it. The direction was solid, John MacLean really does have a good eye for striking cinematography and camera perspective, I also quite enjoyed the way he framed the actors in his shots. Speaking of, Michael Fassbender is just about watchable in anything he does I thought the enigmatic lone gunslinger facade was cool. Plus there was also some pleasant additions within the supporting cast i.e Ben Mendelsohn, Rory Mcann.
Overall, this film maintains a slow pace yet it builds to an energetic and bloody finale. Also it's got some decent filmaking you can really chew on as well, if observing the technical aspects of a film is you're thing. I liked the script, and yeah I thought it was solid, quite good."
" Slow West (2015)
",2020-02-06 00:00:00,7,"Directed by John Maclean. Starring Kodi Smit-McPhee, Michael Fassbender, Caren Pistorius, Ben Mendelsohn, Andrew Robertt, Rory McCann, Edwin Wright, Kalani Queypo. (R)Offbeat western is tough but eccentric, stretching its low-budget dollar to deliver luminous but desolate beauty. Young Scotsman Smit-McPhee follows his fugitive love (Pistorius) to the American West, guided by an outlaw drifter (Fassbender) who is tempted by the price on her head. Overly mannered and self-conscious at times, and has trouble effectively marrying askew whimsy with sudden violence (the Coen brothers influence is felt throughout), but manages a compact, elegiac and often engaging story populated by distinct (if underwritten) characters, filled with visuals and inventions that spark amusement--dig the mobile clothesline and gunmen that pop out of a wheat field like Whac-A-Moles. Lesson to take to heart: any stranger proactively offering to share their absinthe does not have your best interests in mind.70/100"
" Entirely Forgettable
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,3,"The film feels like it was written and directed by aliens who had the Wild West explained to them. No character acts or speaks like a human being. So many strange interactions and confusing choices in dialogue that rely too heavily on the odd mystic aesthetic the film makers try to establish. Everyone is just a caricature: the grizzled highwayman, the innocent boy after love, the sinister bounty hunter. None of them have any depth or realism to draw you in.The plot is extremely thin, which is fine in many westerns where tone and character can carry the run time but that isn't the case here. There's just so little reason to care about anything that's going on and by the time the film ends you're sort of left wondering what the point was.There are way too many superior westerns out there (even modern westerns) to waste time on this. I was perplexed to see this film was even mildly positively received."
" A different westerner
",2019-11-29 00:00:00,8,"Following the trial of his girlfriend, that boy found that real west life is very cruel and intense. The story line is a good one with great scenery. The leading actress has great facial expressions related to that title. I found the ending gloomy but realistic."
" Can't get past the scenery
",2019-11-26 00:00:00,5,"The film is very good due to the writing and performances, but I felt disconnected the entire way through with the film's physical setting. The fact that this is New Zealand and apparently other British settings is so evident from the start that I had to recheck that this was supposed to be set in the American West. This made it inauthentic enough for at least me to not rate it higher, as the scenery including flora and topographical features are blatantly not those of the American West. Too bad. This story could have been set in a similar NZ storyline and worked better, at least for those of us who are overly detail oriented in consideration of the authenticity of genre films."
" Laugh out loud bad
",2019-11-25 00:00:00,2,"Fairly standard western fair plot wise. i.e.guys on a journey with various intent. MANY unlikely scenarios which stretch credulity. Blood looks like Heinz. Listless eunuch protagonist. Plethora of OTT shoot outs which listen the impact of each subsequent one. Cariciture Indians. Zero attention to detail. Obvious CGI. Not on the same planet let alone ballpark as Sam Peckinpha. Nice try thou.. well, not really."
" Yup. Definitely slow
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,3,"Only just enough action to keep me interested. Pretty turgid for most of the movie. Clearly filmed in NZ which, for my money, isn't a good substitute for Colorado. Poor and amateurish building sets. I guess that's why NZ and the UK aren't known for their Westerns"
" Enjoyable rehash of a dead genre
",2019-08-19 00:00:00,8,Slow West is a very fresh and entertaining little western. I didn't feel bored for a minute while watching it. Perhaps because the movie has a rather short running time. Slow West is no pseudo-artsy movie even though the poster and name suggest it. It's a straight up western with a modern twist.
" Michael Fassbender can do anything!
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,8,I love Michael and this is a very typical western so I loved it!
" I'm convinced the script was better than the actual movie.
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,5,"""Slow West"" is a very different kind of western film, one which probably accurately captures some elements of living at a time and place in history that would have killed me pretty quickly no doubt. On the other hand, this movie is making such an effort to be ""unique"" and ""important"", that it gets a bit tiring and grinding at times, in spite of being such a short film.I must say though, when you consider it in terms of sudden, unexpected, deaths per minute, it holds up quite well. In the end, ""Slow West"" successfully captures an atmosphere of grim reality, but is spoiled somewhat by a continuous undercurrent of mediocre high school poetry.Ultimately, ""Slow West"" feels like it is trying really hard to make some statement about life, but it never becomes clear what that is, at least not to me. In complete sincerity, the only statement about life that this film seems to convey is that a lot of attractive, young, women would rather sleep with Michael Fassbender sporting a perfect 5 O'Clock shadow than with a gawky, prebubescent tenth-grader (which, coincidentally, is also the story of my life).You're not going to hate yourself for losing 80 minutes of your life to this half-way decent attempt to stretch the conventional western genre, but you may find yourself left feeling that ""Slow West"" somehow missed an opportunity to be a lot more satisfying film experience than it turned out to be. I'm sure the script was really good though."
" Not A Great Movie, Enjoyable at Times
",2019-07-17 00:00:00,5,"This was a very simple movie, a boy is moving West to find the girl he loves and is joined by a mysterious cow boy along the way. The plot is extremely simple, which wouldn't have been a problem if the rest of the film was up to par, but it just added to the dullness.
Where this film struggled the most is with its characters. After watching the movie I knew just as much about the protagonist, Jay, as I did after watching the trailer. He is a Scottish boy, who fell in love with a girl, and out matched in the west. There's nothing more to him.
Michael Fassbender's character was completely one dimensional. He had no history or background to him at all, is a complete cliche, plus he and Jay's friendship could have been developed a good deal more before reaching the point it did (That's me being vague to avoid spoilers).
As for the girl that Jay loved, she was exactly that, and nothing more, a girl loved by a boy.
Also, without getting into spoilers, a certain character has a change of heart and I still have no idea why, it just happened. It isn't explained, justified, or elaborated on, it just happens and the film moves on. Over all, a longer run time could have helped this movie a lot, being only about 1h 20mins long, it feels incomplete.
If I had to praise the movie for one thing it would be for the imagery. This film had some impressive and beautiful shots which is something I love seeing in movies and it's the reason I gave it 5 stars instead of 3 or 4."
" SO GOOOOD
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,10,Finally a movie where u watch it and go WOW THAT WAS SOME GOOD WRITING DIRECTING AND ACTING im impressed instead of let down and dissapointed
" Bad Western done by people who dont know the old west.
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,3,"This movie had a flawed storyline, bad casting, bad acting, and was slow. Since it was from New Zealand it felt like they had not a clue on the old west. The only good thing was scenery and horses. I would point out all the flaws and cracks, but they didn't put any effort into this then why should I."
" John Maclean's fresh take on the western genre.
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,7,"""Slow West"" kicks off as a regular hero's journey type of situation. But the hero in display is far from the regular western concept of the ""ass kicking"" outlaw. Our hero here, is a teenage boy in a delirious quest for the love of his life, which gives us a tale of the ludicrous type of drama we are about to watch. As the story unravels, we see that the kid has absolutely no conditions of making on his own in this relentlessly violent world, this contrast is important to evidence John Maclean's surreal and twisted take on the western genre. That's where the kind stranger appears, portrayed by the excellent Michael Fassbender, who voluntarily chooses to follow the kid's path, but with vile intentions that go on to be revealed later. The two characters, Jay(Kodi Smit-McPhee) and Silas(Michael Fassbender), present us with amazing chemistry, and in a philosophical level they complete each other, in the sense that Silas is the brute, silent, pessimistic bandit and Jay is the good-willing, loving, optimistic dreamer. This dynamic is eye cathing by the raw nature of it, the two characters sink in a relationship almost in a father-son type of situation. The narrative is pretty agile, shifting back and forth from explosive violence to philosophical insights and dark humor. Even though the film is short, it's a slow burn that occasionally drifts to bloody scenes, up to the grand climax. The usage of flashbacks brings down the depth of the film, by trying to rush plot points in few inserts. Also the voice overs are completely out of context and if taken out of the movie it wouldn't make any difference. Technically, the film excels, the cinematography displays vibrant colors and wide panoramas that shows off the natural beauty in the scenario. The very few close ups in the movie are well placed, making these moments grand in the story context. The secondary characters are but a manifestation of the environment, but are very well managed in such way that each one has an influence in the individual arc development. In ""Slow West"" John Maclean shows that he can handle a genre renovation, and more than that he shows that can present the audience with an intimate, wild, surreal and at times humorous version of the western style."
" Incredibly Slow West
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,1,"Nope. Not looking for another Peter Jackson story that feels like a 5-year-old telling you about something that happened on the playground. And it takes FOREVER! I lasted 26 minutes into to this film and just wanted it to stop. Or have everyone blow up. Or get shot. Anything to end the torture. Take a hard pass on this one, folks."
" Good Try, Better Than Average
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,6,"This interesting little independent film has a nice pace going for it, with some nicely developed characters. It had a feel of a spaghetti western in several places (especially the violence), but much more in the way of character development by the writer and director. The lead actors Fassbinder and Mendelsohn, are highly sympathetic, but I was not buying the sappy, sentimental ending, which I will not reveal. My favorite parts of the film is when apparently nice people turn out to be major lowlifes; just like real life."
" Slow West is hyperbolic
",2019-02-14 00:00:00,6,"A very good story idea is a bit overworked. A Scottish teenager in 1870 is traveling across the American West in search of his lost love. People are shot along the way, one or two every few minutes, which speeds things up. The crop fire is unrealistic, that one burning arrow could set a vast field ablaze in a bit under two minutes on an apparently windless day. Good performances by Fassbender and Pistorius. Smit-McPhee has one facial express for all occasions."
" The Things We Do For Love
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,7,"Lovestruck young man travels across the ocean, then across America to the old west in search of the girl he loves. He runs into someone who can help guide him to his destination but our young man doesn't know all that his guide knows.This was a slowly paced film but I really didn't notice it. The scenes are well shot and I always found something in each of them that kept me interested. It was well acted and the story is not bad at all. I think it was a decent film."
" The Emperor Has No Clothes
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,2,"I wanted to enjoy this but it simply made little sense. The story was too incoherent and contrived. The filmmaker is obviously skilled behind the camera. There were beautiful sequences and it was pretty to look at. But I had the sense that he had little familiarity with the early American West and was merely stacking popular western themes on top of each other with little attention to coherency. On the surface, it may have appealed to many uninitiated, which would explain the bizarre ratio of high ratings. But to the western purist it made little sense. I'm here to call out the emperor: he has no clothes."
" A film to enjoy many times
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,10,"Just because something is slow, it doesn't mean it isn't beautiful and full of harmony.
If some folks were looking for a mindless bloodbath where a merciless hero spits on the villain's grave, they got the wrong ticket.This picture is a beauty; stunning landscapes, good music and pretty realistic (if you compare it with the ton of cartoonish westerns out there).It's not very often that you finish a western feeling uplifted, Slow West is a hell of a great movie, incredible that it is a first director's cut.
Like the kinds of Spielberg or Kubrick, it's one you might consider adding to your shelf."
" It's exactly what it says on the tin, for better or worse.
",2018-12-12 00:00:00,7,"'Slow West (2015)' is a character-focused, slightly revisionist western that's refreshingly unconventional and unafraid to be so, for better and for worse. Its biggest issue is perhaps the one it tells you about up-front; it's strange that it feels as slow as it does considering its relatively short length (eighty-four minutes). Still, never exactly boring, far from it, and it's subversiveness really is a strong asset in an overcrowded market. 7/10"
" Half poetic....half ruthless!!!
",2018-12-04 00:00:00,7,"Made in New Zealand's amazing landscape it resemble an american west territory, the director provides a colorful amazing scenes, the plot in quite original at least, but there so many holes along of the movie that spoils clearly that made some damages without repair as the new brand house, could they made some kind of greying in the woods, some lines spoken poetically are unusual in such period of time, the Angel's face boy contrast with ruthless bounty hunter, l've trying figure out among the clues left behind, a beautiful movie notwithstanding cruel scenes worth to spend one hour and half watching an original neo western!!Resume:First watch: 2018 / How many: 1 / Source: DVD / Rating: 7"
" Don't have 'Slow' in the title.
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,5,"An 'Art House' Western, that is let down first by the title and then with a deliberate ambiance, that does not entirely suit the situation. Still watchable and nicely acted, with a good ending twist but sorry, I like my Westerns way faster."
" Such a slow, beautiful, slow film
",2018-10-24 00:00:00,7,"First off, this film is shot brilliantly and the color palette is excellent. This is a visually stunning film. However the story is a bit too slow and a little too surreal from what the movie is.It's a romance film where the guy tries, fails and tries again to get a girl who will never want him. and the film feels the need to drag on and on and on...I liked it, but I don't see myself watching it anytime soon."
" Historically Accurate Western
",2018-10-17 00:00:00,9,"These days we are treated to re-constructionist Westerns, perverted Westerns, comedy Westerns, Westerns that aren't Westerns at all but something else entirely, and--my favorite--historically accurate Westerns. This film is of the latter category, and well worth the watch. Michael Fassbender treats us all to the slow, plodding story of a Scottish lord who has fallen in love with a tough-as-nails Scottish crofter or peasant girl whose father, trying to save face against the bullying father of the wealthy lad, accidentally kills the landlord and is forced to take his daughter to America. It seems she is also being charged with the murder. The young lord heads across the world to find and marry her. The characters in this film are all excellent--some brutal, some funny, others weird or exasperated or frightened. All played by excellent actors and following a superb script. So if you want to take a break from The Andy Griffith Show and its luminary brilliance of acting and script, as I did, Slow West is a good choice. It has a sad ending, but not one that is wholly unexpected."
" The name says it all
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,9,"Cinematic and believable. Great character development and not predictable as most movies from the movie factory seem to be churned out these days. There are always things as viewers that we'd like to change in movies, but if we could do that, we'd be producing them instead of viewing and critiquing them. I like realistic and unpredictable. This movie was overall quite enjoyable. Worth a watch in my opinion"
" SLOW INDEED...!
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,2,"A pointless art piece masquerading as a Western. Now don't get me wrong, the art film & the Western are not mutually exclusive to each other. Some Westerns have reached the level of art like say Unforgiven or The Searchers or art films which have Western elements in them reach a certain tier of success like The Ballad of Cable Hogue or The Shooting but in this case, the maxim fits, oil does NOT mix w/water. I guess trying to cross off his list of genres to try, Michael Fassbender decided to try his hand in this oatfest which he stars & produces but even running less than 90 minutes, this thing overstays its welcome like a visiting relative on your couch. Kodi Smit-McPhee plays a Scot in America hoping to journey to his lost love w/the help of Fassbender but along the way they run into Ben Mendelsohn (is this guy in everything?) & his bunch of outlaws who make it their mission to ruin their lives. Along w/the recent Damsel, there's been a slow coup of these Western/art hybrids being made but if you're not bringing something to the table unless it's a pretty vista or a gunfight, there's no there, there."
" Superb Western of an entirely different breed
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,9,"Most Westerns are, well, pretty formulaic, with a few novel characters and dependence on violent imagery to fill the 90-120 minutes in today's cinema. This film offers lush imagery of western landscapes, beautifully photographed, a heart-tugging romantic quest, and a story of redemption for at least one character with an admittedly shady past. The story centers on a young Scot's quest to reunite with his true love, Rose, another Scottish immigrant making a new life in the closing days of the still-perilous wild west. He travels at first alone, spurred both by love and the idealized vision of a peaceful, tranquil west he has read about in books. After a near fatal incident, he is joined by a veteran guide/frontiersman who offers to guide him to his reunion many miles further west. There are surprises, hidden agendas, poetic romantic reminiscences, and-yes- violent encounters, all contributing to a well-paced, gripping and oft times, moving story. I cannot remember a film of this genre so diverse and gorgeous. Well done. More!!!"
" Another Netflix disappointment
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,2,"What happened in Scotland that the girl and her dad had to leave? I know it said murder but what was the back story on that? And how did they end up wanted for murder all the way in America? What was up with the Indian, was that a new love interest for Rose that went nowhere? And the ending with Jake? Really? Netflix has the worst movies I swear."
" Boring west
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,5,"I have no problem watching a slow pace movie but the characters and the acting has to keep me interested, and the pay off in the final act, has to be worth all of waiting for something interesting to happen. Kodi was okay. Fassbender and the woman who Kodi is pining for are good eye candy but neither of the characters are interesting. And although the ending does have action, I. M. O it wasn't enough to compensate for this very boring movie. In my experience it's the films that are under 90 minutes takes the longest to end"
" Special
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,8,"I had high expectations for this film all of which were met if not exceeded, its a truly pleasant watch reminiscent of Tarantino's work with moments of lively dialogue and brief releases of somewhat gory and thrilling action, the shock end is touching and I highly recommend a watch"
" British/ New Zealand western?
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,1,A Kiwi western? Hmm. Anti-american drivel. Good scenery.
" Lives up to its name.
",2018-06-03 00:00:00,5,"Slow West is most definitely a slow burn, with slim to no backstory for any of its characters. Making it feel shallow and pointless. Like why am I supposed to care about anyone in this film if I don't know them? The actors do the best with what they are given, but they are given practically nothing."
" Well worth a watch
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,7,This film takes a typical western premise - a journey through a landscape of characters and escapades - but gives it a twist that adds weight and depth.
" I'm at the wrong camp
",2018-01-19 00:00:00,8,"Jay (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a young Sottish lad traveling in Colorado chasing down his lost love Rose (Caren Pistorius). An incident in Scotland caused Rose and her father to flee. The story picks up in Colorado with Jay, an educated young man, way in over his head. After a confrontation, he ends up riding with Silas (Michael Fassbender) a bounty hunter in a land filled with thieves, murderers, bounty hunters, and unhappy Native Americans. 20 minutes into the film we know our drama can only end in tragedy as we wait to see it unfold. Jay is full of hope and a strong character and we wonder if he can change what appears to be inevitable.The film moved at a moderate pace, just enough to keep us hanging on. Good performance by Fassbender.Score: Sex 0; F-bomb 1; nude butts 2. Rating :R"
" Slow, and quite ridiculous
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,3,"If people in the Wild West had killed each other at the rate shown in this film, it would still be wilderness.Appeals to those who think extreme violence is normal.The reality is that most people cooperate in a harsh environment. Violence was mostly personal. Criminals were rare."
" Somewhere between Wonderland and The Far West
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,8,"Slow West is a kind of brand new werstern that takes place in a beautiful landscape without precedents. 
This is an epic journey of a naive hero who goes through dummy but lovely situations which could remind you of Alice's Wonderland because its psychedelia and its moments of intoxication. A bitter-ending amateur odyssey plenty of charming beauty so far away from the cliches of the genre. Is this iconoclastic and cool tragedy the last of the acid westerns?"
" Old West, New Perspective
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,7,"Old West is a movie that is very much a love letter to the western genre of film. Although the film takes on the look and feel of an old school it does take a several diversions from the classic formula in part by completely discarding any romanticized conventions of the genre and instead tells its story with almost a nihilistic realism towards the morality of the characters and there motives. I will criticize the acting of Kodi Smit-Mcphee is really a mixed bag. Overall it really is pretty good overall but his accent really decides when and when not it actually exists. It can be really annoying and actually quite baffling. It really is a shame really considering just how good Smit-Mcphee has been in prior roles.All the other actors in this movie do a great job, in particular Michael Fassbender does a really great job in his support role. And the cinematography and settings of Slow west are some of the most appealing memories of the movie even a week after my initial viewing of the movie. A lot of Westerns really bask in the glory that is the wide open and seemingly unending beauty of the American West but Slow West really steps up its game. I have to think this probably has more to do with the fact that they filmed in New Zealand and not in America or Mexico but it captures the amazing feeling non-the- less. In the end I do really recommend this film to any fans of the Western genre, I just wish I could give it a better score than I did but Kodi Scot-Mcphee just didn't bring his A-game to the main role."
" Trying to gather my thoughts here.
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,7,"I like my movies simple. I like melodrama, high emotional stakes, simple revenge-fueled story lines and effective characters I can care about. But sometimes there is room for different kinds of approach, even for simple bastards like me. ""Slow West"" is a different one, and although it wasn't tight enough to drive home the numerous points it (probably) tried to make, I was invested in an almost passive way.""Slow West"" is a bit of a mess for me. In its core there is a story of desperate, naive love. It's quite innocent and it's something we've all been through. It's about a fantasy, not about pragmatic reality, and fantasies rarely have happy endings. On the other hand, this story is surrounded by bits and pieces of commentary, some about the violent invasion of the New World, some about the darkness of man's soul and other philosophical matters.Now these things aren't bad in themselves, but they seem to be scattered around without any tight emotional connection to anything else that's happening. They are mainly introduced by our protagonists running into strangers who have stories to tell, and sometimes emphasized by voice-over narration. It feels forced and this movie suffers from it. If there is an emotional payoff, the movie just wants to quickly get it over with, or convey it in a manner that doesn't really do much. In other words, this film throws things at you, at it's sometimes clumsy about it.However, there is something honest about this film. In all its weirdness and scattered narrative, it still manages enough. Director/writer John MacLean just probably didn't have the means or experience to fully deliver what he intended. It doesn't feel pretentious, it just feels a little off and perhaps a bit rushed. It still feels somewhat innocent, much like Kodi Smit-McPhee's character. I might be wrong, but at the moment I think this movie has a good heart somewhere under the clutter.Actors are fine, and nobody overacts. Perhaps most of them underact, but that's likely on purpose. Nobody steals the show, this isn't a movie where performances are emphasized but everyone does their job. Smit-McPhee is good as the naive boy chasing his dream, Fassbender's mere presence is enough and the same can be said about Ben Mendelsohn. Rory McCann was a pleasure to see, he makes everything better, including this movie. Caren Pistorius is fine with the little she has.Cinematography has some personal touches. It's not the grand spectacle of scenery and wide colourful shots some westerns can be known of, even though some of that can be found here too, but it feels a little more intimate. It's nice to look at, although not overly impressive.Transitions and editing seems to be a little hit or miss. Things don't flow in the way I'd like them to, and some emotional impact is often lost. At times it works really well, so it's hard to come to a conclusion. Music too. I do like the way how the simple main theme is almost always present and travels with us, but at times it comes across as meaningless.In the end, this is a hard movie to review, but I kind of liked it. The actors were good, there is a lovely innocent story plus a plethora of themes that don't quite connect. It's not quite an art-house movie, but for fans of traditional westerns it might as well be one. If you're looking for a tight story, engaging action, powerful characters and a rewarding ending where everything is resolved just the way you'd want, this is not the movie you want to watch. But if you're in that certain weird mood where you find yourself pondering about various things, you might like this. ""Slow West"" is a movie that probably has a lot to say, but doesn't always know how - or when - to say it. These movies have their place too."
" An under-looked western film
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,8,"Slow West stars Kodi Smith-McPhee and Michael Fassbender and its the story of Jay, and how he tries to reunite with his loved one Rose, and Silas tags along his journey. Slow West is a very unique and weird film, but it is pretty great. The acting was pretty great, the characters are well written and they are pretty memorable. The cinematography was fantastic and it gave a lot of style to the film. The action sequences, although there is only a few, are well filmed and this is where the direction really shines. The director knows what to show and what not to show, and what shows is stellar. The score it pretty great and it complements the film excellently. The script is pretty good although it could be better. In the beginning there is some exposition and the ending is not believable. I honestly don't like the ending since it is very simple and very unrealistic. It leaves you hanging by a thread and it does not resolve things. The score it pretty great and it complements the film very excellently. The major themes throughout the film is well handled and it does not come off as heavy handed nor forced. The themes gave it a lot of substance to the film. This is probably one of the best modern westerns out there and I strongly advice you to see this one since it is that good. 8/10"
