" Funny and different
",2021-04-05 00:00:00,8,"I was worried when Laggies got started, because I've seen a fair number of movies about people who have grown up physically but not mentally. Laggies felt like it was headed down a path to relive a lot of the same tropes as other movies in this genre, and that typically means I will find the main character obnoxious and annoying. Yet, I kept being surprised by this movie. There was actual nuance to the film, and the protagonist wasn't a living cliche that was totally inauthentic. Perhaps the plot is helped along by the fact that Keira Knightley is so endearing, but I found myself on her side even though she was shirking a lot of responsibilities and dodging tough conversations. Instead of coming off like a whiny woman-child, she just feels like a real person that is afraid of the complexities of adult life. I've done that myself (or wanted to) many times, and I suspect most grown-ups can relate to these feelings.Aside from Keira Knightley, the rest of this cast is stacked as well. I love the dynamic that Knightley has with Chloë Grace Moretz, because that's the kind of odd adult-child relationship that always makes me laugh. Also, there's simply no denying that Laggies becomes an even better film when Sam Rockwell shows up. He has the comedic chops to elevate the movie even further. Laggies is not all perfection, though. Some of the choices that they make with the plot are a little too safe. I can't go into too much detail without spoiling the entire end of the film, so I'll just say it felt like an opportunity to surprise the audience yet again, but at that point they went a more traditional direction. There were also some character choices and subplots that bugged me and didn't feel like they were handled all that well. These quibbles don't break the film, but that's why Laggies didn't earn a perfect score from me. But, aside from those small complaints, I found Laggies an all-around joy to watch."
" Weird, but humorous in a way
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,5,"I do like Sam Shepherd's weirdness and the whole plot works for him. The romance, is a little on the creepy side, but I get the whole not wanting to adult yet for someone her age. It's quirky but watchable"
" Lively and lovely movie
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,10,"It gives you really good perspective.
watching it made me feel like when you know it you know it."
" ""You can't keep putting aside what you want for some imaginary future.""
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,7,"A woman who is approaching her thirties and still doesn't know what she wants from life (like most of us, I would say), accidentally meets a teenager and uses her to escape responsibility, at least for a short time. A romantic comedy elevated from mediocrity by a rather realistic depiction of the mental state that most of us go through at some point in our lives. Some go through it maturely and responsibly, even painlessly, but many bring themselves into tragicomic situations as the heroine of this film. Partly because I found myself in this story to some extent, and partly because of Keira Knightley and Chloë Grace Moretz, I have to rate it at least a little higher than it objectively deserves.7/10"
" Creepy posing as cutsie
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,3,What kind of dad finds out that his teen daughter is secretly having sleepovers with a 30 year old and thinks it's fine? I noped out when he was okay with her buying his daughter lingerie.The tone was super weird for the content.
" Great movie...with a lackluster ending
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,7,"Knightley's ""revelation"" in the end is frustratingly cheap, and in a lesser movie could've ruined the whole thing. Instead, it just leaves a (admittedly deep) scar on an otherwise sweet-natured and funny indie. All the performances are solid, with Rockwell especially deftly pulling off a fairly silly character with more than a few inflated moments. It's a solid argument for growing up, in spite of our sadly infuriating tendencies to stay young."
" Unorthodox story and good intentions don't lead to a good result
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,5,"The story goes ""beyond 'Friends' or 'How I Met Your Mother' "" kind of stories, about group of young friends goofing around. This is not a nice story and that is why it is not often depicted.""First youth"" has passed and these people are grown up (but still young), coping with that in their own ways. Some of them keep within the group, but others don't relate to the group any more, like Keira Knightley here. This is a problem and a source of conflict, as she really needs to leave the group, but can't bring herself to do it.Showing how our protagonist goes through this conflict, first regressing to teenage-ism and then going all the way through a way-too-early mid-life crisis is interesting and certainly well intended.But, it doesn't work very well. Knightley is past her prime, which, if you remember her from before, makes her look more like she's in her mid 30s, while the movie very much stands on her being in late 20s. Somehow this also goes for her cute, which she is not here, even though she tries (as if she forgot how to). It all comes down to us not caring much about what happens to her, yet the whole point of the movie is to make us care.Partly because of the above, the movie is way less funny than it could have been. There's a lot of fun and funny situations to be had in this odd scenario, but, very little comes out.Story-wise, it ends way too abruptly for a satisfying end of the journey to adulthood for our protagonist. It's almost as if the movie could have better ended with her dumping her fiancée (still tied to their old group) at the airport (eloping to Las Vegas).Sam Rockwell (and his tortoise) are the only really good part about the movie. He does play it a little ""too much his style"", but, that's kind of the point, he is a well-adjusted middle-aged man (though, ""young"" middle aged), yet unhappy; such people are usually doing it ""too much their style"". This is supposed to be a comedy, yet it seems he's the only one who got the memo.So, while interesting to watch for its unorthodox story, it's disappointing that it doesn't deliver as well as it could. Thus, this is only for the ones who love such movies for the unorthodoxy's sake."
" Nothing but new but enjoyable
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,8,Nothing particularly new but a fantastic and likeable cast made this much more enjoyable than your average romcom. Great fun if lacking a little originality good Friday night viewing.
" A coming of age movie for the ones society impose to be already ""of age""
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,8,"I'm a guy in love with teen movies and chick flicks, even though i'm a lot into movies universe and I love cinematography. I think that Laggies features a right coming of age story, without being pretentious or incoherent.
By personally being in my middle 20s and experiencing that ""i'm lost"" phase without understanding where life aims and what your unique destiny is, I felt sort of connected with the main lead role, also I experienced that sense of ""all the friends around me are jerks"" and I think the movie depicts it perfectly. It's a coming of age movie for the ones society impose to be already ""of age"" and that's good, since it's common.Keira Knightley is stunning, as always."
" Charming and thoughtful
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,9,"Really loved this small drama/comedy by Lynn Shelton. Charming and thoughtful, well-cast and acted. If you have trouble trouble growing up yourself, then you are going to love it."
" A middle age booster END is irritating
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,6,"Keira Knightley acted so well. A just to marry couple lady is taken for a ride in this film. She takes forceful tricky Seminar kind of engagements and passes her time with a teenage girl she has recently come across and the group of hers. She even falls attached to a witty lawyer father of her friend too! Well for dumping her original hubby she finds out excuse almost unconvincingly at airport about Sharing Joy in the groups... Its all right she has a new group she fancies the tuning with that middle aged lawyer but in lighter vein story is unfolded gradually. Still enjoyed the current generations liking and a little cheat is OK attitudes in story nicely told. Its not right to comment about ethics when liking , choices, feeling good, choices of sexual partners and relationships hoodoo are being exploited for films . Main actress role is portrayed and performed full marks praise-worth. Many embarrassing moments otherwise socially voyeur kind have been taken lightly and does not have the taboos attached with."
" Loved it!
",2019-07-15 00:00:00,8,"I don't believe this movie gets enough credit for what it is. A simple, well-made, entertaining film. The actors were all on their game. Keira Knightley, Chloë Grace Moretz, Sam Rockwell, and the rest of the cast have something to be proud of.The film will do what movies are meant to, let you escape from the world for a little while. Well done!"
" Okay one off watch
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,6,"This one did not stand up to a rewatch. I liked it well enough on the first viewing, but when I watched it again, I couldn't get past how far fetched it was that a single dad would be okay with a 20 something hiding out in his house with his teenage daughter. I also found his character hammy and annoying to the point I was irritated whenever he was onscreen.
I did like the idea of a young woman whose friends are all settling down and she's just not there herself. I liked both Keira and Chloe in this and it does have its good moments, but as a whole a bit flat and flawed."
" Pleasantly forgettable.
",2019-04-18 00:00:00,6,"We understand, you're having trouble growing up. Get on with it, and while you're doing so, amuse us. Luckily, the movie does a pretty good job at that while keeping things overly safe for its hapless heroine, Megan, played by Keira Knightley."
" Loved this
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,8,"It was so touching, decent and refreshing to watch. An overlooked gem I'd never heard of & thrilled that I watched."
" Fun movie until the end
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,6,"This movie was enjoyable and funny at times, but the end was sloppy.Megan ends up breaking up with her long time boyfriend which was really unexpected and triggered by her getting outraged at him for sending a pic of them together to their friends. (Really?) and only meant to serve the 'Hollywood ending' of returning to Craig so they can continue being together.It also felt predictable that after she was given a ticket to the prom, you knew she'd end up going, and not fly to Vegas to elope. (Otherwise, what was the point of adding that scene?)I didn't understand why she figured that her friends were holding her back. I mean, she's the one that was the 'laggie' while they matured and had professional lives. So not sure what 'coming of age' moment she had, to think that her friends were the problem and she had to cut them loose.But film aside, the cast was great. Sam Rockwell is a pleasure to watch when he plays a 'good guy'."
" Make sure you're wasted when watching.
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,2,"Predictable af. Terrible writing. Fell asleep multiple times. If you enjoy torturing yourself, watch this flick."
" JUST SHIFTING
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,7,"Meagan( Keira Knightley) is a 20 something who has her degree and doesn't know what she wants to do with her life. She was part of a group of four girls all BFF, but she now feels out of place with them as they have moved on in life. She lives with Anthony (Mark Webber) who is also a procrastinator. Multiple events at a wedding cause Meagan to need some ""me"" time. She befriends Annika (Chloë Grace Moretz) and crashes at her place. After being interrogated by her father (Sam Rockwell), an unorthodox divorce lawyer, she is allowed to stay under false pretenses.At this point the dramedy becomes pretty formula. I love anything Keira Knightley. She plays interesting roles and always puts on her ""A"" game. The film was a light drama. It was somewhat romantic unless your a guy like Anthony who just lost his ""live in"" gf to a guy she just met who has more money. Not that I am still bitter about it. Good acting and entertaining.Guide: F-bomb. Brief sex. No nudity."
" 10/10
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,10,"I like how, every time I watch this movie as I get older, it makes more and more sense to me, as I relate more and more with Keira's character. I wish to be as happy as she is and as careless about the world when she is laying low."
" Oh Kiera!
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,1,"Watched about 40 minutes, then wondered *WHY* I watched for that long at all. This is a 'comedy' that lacks any memorable jokes, one-liners, pratfalls or funny scenes of any kind. Not much in the way of decent character development or plotline - just scenes of stale, meandering dialogue between cast members who all have the same personality - emotionally stunted, juvenile, losers. Pass this one up."
" Terrific and absorbing; visual expression of the twenty first century
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,10,"Found this movie entertaining and absorbing. Keira Knightley who stands through as an important carer giver and taker; is like an imaginary sister. The picture is a source to understand that 'life is not perfect'; with ups and downs in relationships which are essentially by blood. 
The father and daughter; Keira and father. The mother and child; Keira and mother are both relationships where meaning can and is derived; watch out for life and death under the visual stimulus. Visual treats are Keira herself with hands by side of a teenager who she meets. 
The methods to instill justice over the whereabouts of life could be claimed as a plot narrative. In the end an appreciation of circumstances are found or not meant literally by Hollywood; is the Indian appreciation of this movie. Letting nothing go to dumpsters: life consisting of food, shelter and clothing suits us well through the movie screening. 
Terrific visual movie with suitable buddies."
" Glad I got around to it
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,9,"I'd put off watching this- it looked a little more poignant than I felt like watching, but I'm glad I got around to it, because I ended up really enjoying it. Despite a slightly dodgy accent Keira was really engaging and likeable, despite her character's shortcomings. After seeing Rockwell in other films I probably wouldn't have cast him as a caring and responsible Dad, but he's perfect- a very good actor, and the character is a nice change from the usual 'Everything fell apart when my wife died/left, I don't know how to raise a child' trope of single fathers. The characters are rounded, the film is well written and the ending appropriate and satisfying. Chloe Grace Moretz is the perfect balance of teen rebel and actually relatable human being. It's really perfectly cast, well directed and generally enjoyable. The only real downfall is the supporting characters- they're rather shallow and convenient/expositional and it's in sharp contrast to the realistic and rounded mains."
" A coherent delight!
",2017-06-03 00:00:00,8,I was really surprised by the film 'Say When'/'Laggies' Something about the out set lead me to harshly expect a personality-less film. I was delighted however when I realised I was enjoying it from the word go. I think it was refreshing to see Keira knightly holding court as a brazen socially rebellious character as I have literally only really seen the pouting in corsets version of Knightly (entirely my fault) I now realise she has the gumption and watch-ability of a leading woman.I'm not American so it's not watertight for me to say that the accent was spot on but it felt confident and I believed it! When I read the synopsis I was intrigued to see it because I love a film about unlikely partnerships it is the ultimate way to pull out more unique details in a story and the script was great! Sam Rockwell who played the scathing Lawyer dad was lathered in wit and I thought his performance was deliciously captivating. His character was a brilliant father figure both responsible and loving but really suave at the same time. Moretz also performed well in her role I really warmed to the dynamic pairing of her and knightly - it was smart casting. Throughout I felt the film had some great observations and moments that I could really connect with as the film draws on themes of late blooming and not following life's script the way our peers around us do. I did feel however that the resolve at the end wasn't as succulent as I'd hoped and perhaps a little self indulgent but what I did feel at the end was that I wanted to spend more time with these characters as the script and performances where distinctive and believable!
" I don't know if I would've liked it without Sam Rockwell
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,7,"Keira Knightley's character was hard to like at times. It may be that she closely resembled my ex in how poorly she made decisions, never considering the effects her choices had on anyone else. But that's pretty real, I guess. And her character develops well over the course of the film. I think she finally gets it, but I would have a hard time ever trusting someone like her (again).It's not that I don't like a mixed protagonist. It's just that I wanted to shake her at different moments, and yell, ""What are you doing?! Are you even thinking at all?!"" But one would probably think that of me, watching my life from the outside. It's convicting, considering that we're all mixed protagonists in our own lives.Sam Rockwell is consistently supreme in his ability to deliver performances that produce audible laughter from me. I'll pretty much watch anything he does, and though sometimes the film is mediocre, he is always exceptional—I never regret the decision to watch.If you're looking for some great Sam Rockwell movies, check out ""The Way Way Back"" and ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"". He's great in everything I've seen him in, though."
" Knightley shines in a dud film
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,2,"Some people call this film 'Say When', some people call it 'Laggies' - I call it a decent enough film that stars Keira Knightley that never quite lives up to its potential.I like Knightley, I think she's a better actress than people give her credit for, especially in comedies. But this film is below her, it's full of cheap laughs and lewd humour.She shines though in every scene, and is well supported by Sam Rockwell, who despite the years going by I still remember most from 'Galaxy Quest'.This film should've been better. It's not."
" If you're a thirty something Peter Panette this is for you
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,8,"I thoroughly enjoyed Say When. But then I'm a thirty-something Peter Panette who hasn't grown up, found true love and who's biggest regret is never having made it to a high school prom. Its all about whether you're content with your pretty comfortable lot or whether you yearn for the same unbridled ambition you had as a teen. Sam Rockwell's character is hilarious - you don't want to like him but it's difficult not to like anyone so flawed. Ditto for Kiera Knightley's. It's the kind of movie that gives us millennials/generation x'ers hope that there is a silver lining to all the hard work. Now where can i find my own Craig...."
