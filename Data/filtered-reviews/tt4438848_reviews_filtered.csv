" Not as good as the first...
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,5,"""Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising"" is a Comedy movie and the sequel of ""Neighbors"", in which we watch the couple dealing with a new problem after the fraternity, a sorority. The sorority is far worse than the fraternity which lived previously there and the couple needs to do something about it for one more time.I liked the sequel of ""Neighbors"" but I did not like as mush as the first movie. The direction which was made by Nicholas Stoller, as in the first movie, it was good but he did not succeed on presenting something new or different from what he presented on the first movie. For one more time the interpretations of Rose Byrne who played as Kelly Radner, Seth Rogen who played as Mac Radner and Zac Efron who played as Teddy Sanders were very good but not enough to save this movie. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising"" is a nice but average comedy movie if you compare it with the first movie but still watchable."
" What is this crap
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,1,"Another movie ruined by political correctness, I dont know who wrote the jokes in this film but every single joke missed the mark, I didn't laugh once, utterly crap"
" Good Movie
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,6,Honestly I don't understand why people hate this movie i thought it was hilarious and recommend watching it
" Not the best, not the worst
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,6,"It's a satirical movie with a simple plot, which lets you put your mind on ease after a long day. Don't expect to get enlightened by it, there's nothing insightful. At times it's disgusting, at times it's sexist, but it's not boring. If you don't like mindless, dumb comedy, pass. But if you don't mind a bit of dumbness for the sake of a few chuckles, go for it."
" Seth Rogen is awesome
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,8,"I really dont understand why the critics its so bad. This film for me is very good, I laughed all the time. Seth Rogen, Ike Barinholtz and Zac Efron are amazing in the movie. Very worthy to watch"
" Woke garbage
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,2,"This movie needed the words ""MESSAGE!"" Flashing across the screen every 30 seconds. Maybe three jokes landed the entire movie. Don't bother."
" Great Sequel
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,8,"As a parent and college graduate this sequel did not disappoint. All the actors and actresses killed it and I could not stop laughing. If you loved the original, give this film a watch."
" Do not listen to the reviews
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,7,"This is a very solid sequel, the reviews make no sense, if you enjoyed the first one you should definitely enjoy this one. not as many laughs as the first one but still worth the watch"
" Fun but not funny.
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,5,"I think this movie has good structured storylines for its characters like the parents, the girls and Teddy but the comedy didn't click with me especially when a joke is a running gag."
" An example why people torrent movies
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,5,"Preachy annoying and a bit satirical.Most of the ""feminist and racial points"" are satire. But it's still too annoying for being so pushed.Go woke go brokeFirst one was decent because of its originality. This one was cash grab. Interesting use of women for a cash grab. Almost like low key prostitution"
" 2010 comedy in a nutshell.
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,1,"On what planet are these actors good comedians? They have zero comedic timing and they act like acting school students. I'm talking about the younger cast. Even Chloe Moretz who clearly lost her acting talent after reaching puberty. Seth Rogen has his own category of bad for himself. Most unfunny actor to date. No wonder he doesn't do much anymore now. Actors are not the only ones to blame for this unfunny mess, the script is embarrassing! Clearly made by people who watched too much Office and Parks & Recreation. And the so called sarcasm that is filled with PC commonplaces. Shoot me or them now... First movie had an interesting concept, and a fast pace. This one is agonizing amongst bad jokes and wooden acting. Don't waste your time on it."
" A Most Underrated Sequel
",2020-09-01 00:00:00,9,"It may seem like a familiar premise in the case of being compared to the first film, but surprisingly Neighbors 2 does a good job at being and feeling like a fresh sequel and has plenty of jokes to keep you engaged along the way. As I did with the first film, I enjoyed the cast of this one. All the actors bring their A-game to their performances, and I also enjoyed Chloe-Grace Moretz as the new leader of the sorority. The film is a rather simple journey, and though parts of it may not work as well as others, there is no doubt that this film, as is the original, is absolutely hilarious. Granted, there are certainly a few moments that feel pale in comparison to the first one, as it just doesn't feel like anything new, but the times where the film decides to take action and give us something different to see, is by far its greatest moments and something I wouldn't mind watching again. It's a sequel that doesn't feel rushed or forced, and one that actually surprised me given the case of some negative reviews on IMDb. In the end however, Neighbors 2 is a fun and fresh sequel, that certainly has its flaws, but proves to be just enjoyable enough for you to forget all about them.
My Rating: 9.25/10"
" Funny as F
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,7,If you like S.Rogen & Z. Efron you will love this bong humored film. I dont Understand all the hate. All raters are weed hateing people in here.
" Horrible movie
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,1,Dont waste your time on this movie! Only the actress is beautifull
" Funnier sequel than the original
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,9,"Bad Neighbours 2 is a funnier sequel than the original that has a surprisingly smart ending. Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne and Zac Efron are all great once again. Ike Barinholtz and Dave Franco are really good. Newcomers ChloÃ« Grace Moretz, Kiersey Clemons and Beanie Feldstein are all great. It's well paced and has less jokes that don't land than its predecessor. Nicholas Stoller's direction is great and the soundtrack is really good."
" A lot of the plot is recycled from its predecessor
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,6,"Not sure we needed a sequel, a lot of the plot is recycled from its predecessor. I didn't enjoy the first film, so little surprise this didn't work for me either.I appreciate the main stars individually. Seth Rogen, Zac Efron and Rose Byrne have all done good things but I don't like them together, there isn't much chemistry between them. The new cast members are fine, Beanie Feldstein perhaps the standout, though they don't raise the film up at all."
" Bad Neighbours 2 rents out double the parties, crude gags and tampered air bags.
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,5,"The first instalment to this rather unoriginal series of comedy features was still somewhat refreshing, mostly due to the kinetic energy sparking off the cast members. The jokes were all nasty, dirty and filled with enough profanity to start its own sewerage works, yet solely functioned based on the cast's delivery. Coming from me, it was surprisingly funny. This sequel replicates the structural basis of its predecessor. A society of college students move into the house next door, hosting raucous parties and marijuana shindigs, preventing buyers from purchasing the Radners' house. But, instead of sweaty males in a fraternity, the new residents are independent females in a brand new sorority. Commeth the sorority uprising!This sequel is categorically unnecessary. It is not pivotal viewing. You will live a glorious life without having watched girls hurl used tampons at the neighbours' windows. Having said that, the recycled formula does still bring in a few intermittent laughs sprinkled throughout. From scathing one liners such as ""there's a Jew in the oven"" to Efron revealing his hairy (or were they hairless, can't remember...) nuts during a grand distraction. Once you bypass the level of crudeness and ganja that pollutes the air, you'll have an enjoyable time. Even if you won't remember any of the shenanigans the next day.Naturally, with a sorority house being showcased, the narrative includes a feminist spin. Addressing several segments of sexism and misogyny that invade frat parties, such as spraying of water on the bosoms of young girls. Whilst initially this type of prejudice acts as a catalyst to form the new sorority house, it collapses in on itself when the overtly feministic overtone is constantly referenced over and over again without providing any fuel for the actual plot. Essentially, it feels forced for the sake of maintaining a complexion of equality. I'm all for a feministic perspective, but in a comedy it needs to provide foundations for hilarity. Stoller's sequel fails to capture that tone and fully maximise its potential.A shame really considering the talents of Efron and Moretz who command every scene with their comedic delivery. Consistently on point. Awkwafina was grossly underused as well as Kudrow. Rogen and Byrne take a backseat approach in comparison to the predecessor, but still function well together and provide organic chemistry. Aside from that introductory vomiting scene. That, was hideous. Their bad parenting sub-plot was undercooked and only provided padding to the already short runtime.Still, Bad Neighbours 2 is more of the same. In fact, more of the exact same. So if you loved the frat boys partying the night away, I'm sure you'll love the sorority girls pretending to be minions from 'Despicable Me'. If you failed to laugh at Franco doing his best De Niro impression, well think twice before venturing into this sequel which sees an infant play with a pink vibrator."
" Had some funny laughs
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,6,Had some funny laughs so it's worth checking out. It was better then the 1st one but that does not say a whole lot.
" This is bad
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,1,"The first one was bad enough, this is even worse than I remember than the first being. Completely humorless."
" You were expecting 'Classic' Cinema?
",2019-10-15 00:00:00,6,"Just watched this on FX and I laughed a lot.
I'm not even a Seth Rogen fan but that might just change, because he is funny in this movie.
And now I'm a 64-year-old dirty old man who always liked girls my age or older but that little blonde girl who heads the sorority is so cute! Just put your brain on ice and watch and enjoy some non-classic cinema."
" Awesome movieâ¤
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,10,"Just screw the people who really giving bad reviews.ð
The cast crew was amazing especially zac efron and seth rogen were brilliant. The storyline is a little bit different from the bad neighbors.If you have enjoyed the first one then definitely you should watch this to have some good laughs."
" Indiewire called it one of the best sequels ever made
",2019-09-18 00:00:00,2,"I dont even know how the hell to even start...
But is obvious the political agenda behind this hollow s*** of movie... it was the beginning of this clown era we are living in right now..
No one laughed while watching it.. Literally no one... Not a single joke created a reaction..
What bothers me the most is that absolutely love the first one, so many funny moments..
Why?!! Why going this direction?!!"
" Is this a comedy?
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,5,They completely ruined even the first movie this sequel shouldn't have existed
" Millennials have no sense of humour. This was pretty funny if you're not.
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,6,Millennials have no sense of humour. This was pretty funny if you're like 12-24. Who watches movies in the theatre? You actually expected groundbreaking comedy? All these reviewers are idiots.
" It was pretty funny
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,8,"I'm not sure why this movie gets so much hate because there're some genuinely funny moments from the pranks the characters play on each other to the dialogue and slapstick. After the events of the first movie Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) are preparing to move due to having a kid. While their house is in escrow for 30 days a girl named Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) decides to form her own sorority next door out of frustration with the sorority she left. With the help of 2 other disillusioned girls Beth (Kiersey Clemons) and Nora (Beanie Feldstein) she forms her own sorority called ""Kappa Nu"".At first things start out fine but after finding out they're about to be evicted Shelby decides to start throwing frat parties much to their neighbors dismay. Needless to say hi jinks ensure as an all out war breaks out in the neighborhood. The characters are hilarious to watch. When they talk you're bound to laugh due to their stupidity. When they pull a prank or are at the recieving end of one it's hilarious! There's a scene where Mac and Teddy (Zac Efron) get trapped in a garage and try to breakout by using airbags. Needless to say they get tore up and it's hilarious.As crude as this movie is there's still heart. I'm pretty sure one of the themes are women empowerment as shown throughout most of the movie. Neighbors 2 is a hilarious movie and I highly recommend you check it out."
" Comedy is dead.
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,1,"So this is the state of comedy nowadays. Absolute garbage.That movie was 98% recommended on Netflix and in the ""trending"" tab, so i was expecting something good-ish, or at least close to it. But no. It's just bad. from start to finish, it's pure and utter waste
Everything is sexist; It reeks ""Women Power, women so stronk""; All characters are as dumb as a rock; All jokes are unfunny and very childish (a few made me at least smile); The story is ""meeeh"" at best. I don't blame the actors, they were ok, overall. I blame the writting, which was awful.Identity politics invaded Hollywood, and we can see the damage it has done. Comedy is unfunny now.Look, if you have some brain cells, save them by not watching that movie. I've wasted my time by watching it. Don't waste yours."
" Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,7,7/10 - this flick was actually was pretty hilarious
" The first one does not prepare you for this. Really something.
",2019-07-02 00:00:00,9,"The first movie was a fun little romp but this one was not what I expected.Although it rehashes the premise of the first movie with the brilliantly original (!) twist of making the new antagonist female, you're in for a much more discomforting experience overall. The laughs are there in a messed up kind of way and it gives us female characters of a kind we're not used to seeing. Those which aren't afraid to act like males basically. They're not tomboys or butch but they have personalities; they're clever but they're not mired in the moral high ground like Lisa Simpson or Hermione Granger is.Would I call it a feminist movie? Not sure. There's something a lot more genuine here than in ""Brave"" or the Lady Ghostbusters (as much as I enjoyed the latter). They weren't pandering; in their depiction of race, gender and the various age groups we have ask ourselves some rather uncomfortable questions.In one scene the girls weaponize their feminine hygiene items. ""Where did you make the blood""?""...our ovaries"".There are a lot of other darkly/grossly funny moments that I won't ruin and like the first movie it is a delicious game of one devious group against another without an obvious favourite for the win.My favourite thing about the movie though is the poignant depiction of inter-generational relationships and ageing as a young adult tries to hold desperately to his youth and finds he has more in common with his family-starting ex-rivals. It's actually really adorable.Both Zac Efron and Seth Rogen really prove themselves as actors that are better than what we've typed them for and it's a a treat to see them prove to the world that they have a lot to give us.The female lead is great too: cute, evil, frightening, a little bit vulnerable, whatever her name is I hope to see her in other stuff.A brilliant piece of repulsive, good vs evil comedy."
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,8,"Very funny and creative. an awesome and entertaining movie. other than the comedy, i love the situations they end up getting into and the directions the story went. another example of a movie where not watching the trailers adds significant value to the experience. and the characters are great, specifically the main 3. they have great depth continuing from the first movie. (3 viewings)"
" make it stop
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,1,"How,more importantly why,do friends try to talk me into trying to watch these stupid,unfunny things,like 10 minutes is it & this tryhard non talent does me in.
How,more importantly why,is rogen given roles &,but mainly money please someone,something make it stop it's just never going to happen that he's ever going to be funny.I'd laugh more watching parliament question time while dying from the plague"
" More feminist bullcrap
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,1,We the people of the USA get it... girls can do what boys do.... but can you atleast try to be funny about it.
" i love it
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,Review: I enjoyed this movie because it shows you brotherhood doesn't stop at sexuality. The direction is really good and the screenplay is smart. The casting and acting are both really good. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Political correct garbage!
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,2,Seth Rogan and the main adult actors where good but the whole movie was a crap shoot! Wouldn't watch it again.
" This is one of the worst movies ever
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,1,"This could have been good, but it came with a bad storyline, bad acting, bad agenda that if forced down your throat. And awkwafina is annoying to listen to."
" Tricky sequel syndrome
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,6,"The first was fun and funny, and they should maybe have left it at that. It's not a bad film, but if, like me, you liked the first one you'll be disappointed. They went off in some weird direction and seemed to forget what made the first one great. Just an odd call from the filmmakers."
" Disjointed And Unfunny
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,3,"I could take or leave Bad Neighbours like I could take or leave Police Academy - an undemanding, but essentially funny, comedy which delivered the goods in terms of laughs and performances. Like Police Academy, however, you have to ask whether you could make a decent sequel based on such a thin premise.The answer here is no.For a start, bearing in mind the contrived way they're crowbarred into events, neither Seth Rogan or Rose Byrne actually contribute any significant to the plot or develop as characters; in fact, their appearances amounts to little more than glorified cameos, and strained ones at that; and although Byrne actually tries (and is OK for it), Rogan appears happy to coast it - indulged by a script and director who are unable (or unwilling) to actually give him something to do.Zac Efron's storyline is actually more interestng; the former college golden boy, now cast adrift and vulnerable after his graduation; unfortunately, rather than dwell on his (self inflicted) misfortunes he is soon submerged into Chloe Grace Moretz's and co's train wreck of an all female frat house....and almost as quickly jettisoned, in yet another plot contrivance, so he can join forces with Byrne and Rogan.How much of the film's social commentary is true of the US today I cannot say - I know about much about the in and outs of American Universities as I do about US property laws - but I seriously doubt that today's frat houses are run like crossovers between strip bars, sawdust joints and National Lampoon's Animal House (a far funnier film, incidentally).The film has a fairly liberal agenda and various social hypocracies are railed against - in relation to dope smoking, alcohol abuse, arbitrary law enforcement, moral panics and treatment of women...but the alternatives proposed here (if you can call them that) in today's climate are uncomfortable to watch, or inappropriate, are out of tune with the supposed values being pushed. And they are just downright unfunny for the most part, as is the endless bad language.The film tries to tick so many boxes, it soon loses focus on what the storyline is actually supposed to be about. Byrne, Efron and Selena Gomez (in a small cameo) actual get pass marks for decent performances...but the rest is a confused, lazy attempt to retread the first part.I hope there's no part 3."
" why?
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,3,"The writter/ director unintentionally made to much effort to make you cringe during the movie, not to laugh. I hated the actress ChloÃ« Grace Moretz just for her role. From now on, when I see ChloÃ« Grace Moretz I think of Shelby the brat college kid with no ethics. Not a good move for your carrer, sweetie. BTW, have you counted so many times they mention the word ""sexist""? Yes, they made women's rights a bad-written movie joke. Bravo!"
" Couldn't finish this!
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,1,"Seriously, terrible and lame, no laughs and I just couldn't finish it!"
" How not to portray feminism
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,1,"This movie is an awful attempt to make fun of feminism and female empowerment, can't believe the female actors actually agreed to be in this. Didn't laugh once, don't bother."
" Too many really bad reviews!
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,6,"Is it moronic? Yes
Is it a bad film? Er, no.....well maybe. 
Quirky, funny, laugh out loud in parts. We all know Seth, ha, Zac Efron: great comedy actor, and Frasier Crane's cameo, class. Come on guys, lighten up."
" Train wreck
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,1,"On paper this movie should be funny. It's not. I can't quite put my finger on why. Maybe it started poorly with a clichÃ¨d vomit scene that was just disgusting. Maybe it's that the characters are poorly written, or that the ""what goes wrong?"" Premises that are the staple of this kind of movie, are ludicrous. Oddly, I found the movie really annoying. Didn't even watch until the end bacause I couldn't care less what happens to the story or any of the characters."
" Brings nothing new to the beer pong table
",2018-07-11 00:00:00,4,"Can Seth Rogan be a in a film without it involving pot? Is it in his contract or something? My partner loves him and all of his films. I don't. Because I am more into films we usually watch films I want to see, so something has to give. That means watching all three Bad Neighbor films. TBH I can't even remember the first two other than being scarred from the sex scenes between Rose Burns and Seth Rogan. And actually, maybe this is only the second? I don't know and I don't care and I'm not going to find out.The all-male writers obviously thought they had stumbled on revolutionary territory over the revelation that sororities can't have parties. Cue the rebellious Chloe Moretz (who by the way in this is cool, I liked her) setting up her own with two suddenly best friends. Of course it is in the old house where all the Frat problems of Rose Burn and Seth Rogan's characters first began. The girls meet Zac Effron, the man child with issues that force him to run around the neighbourhood without any shoes on. He is however as great as he possibly can be with his performance considering how basic his character is. Anyway it's another all out battle between houses as Rose and Seth want to sell their house blah blah with Zac needing to chose a side- his forever peter pan young side or his old past college side.Just one of those extra films that gets made to make money at the box office. Doesn't matter how bad the first, second or third films are if they do well in the box office expect more of them. Inane? Yep. But everyone keeps watching! This film obviously heavily involves pot smoking and how cool smoking is. I don't care about smoking but I am starting to think that Americans do it all the time and seem to think it's as rebellious and serious as getting out the old heroin syringe. So yeah, I can't really be bothered to summarise."

" Still a simple, fun comedy
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,6,"'Bad Neighbours 2' (or 'Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising' in America) is a straightforward comedy sequel - all that's changed is the frat next door is replaced with a sorority (one of the funnier scenes involves how to spell ""sorority""!). Mac (Rogen) & Kelly (Byrne) are back - as are the cute twins who play their daughter, now two years older - and still at it (literally in the opening scene). Shelby (Moretz) plays the leader of the new sorority moving in next door, but they do take some time to build her character, along with Beth (Clemons) and Nora (Feldstein) and make them non-stereotypical teenage girls - for the most part.There's a fair bit that doesn't work: still heaps of pot, most of it unnecessary, with Rogen must have written into his contracts or he won't appear, the predictable ending, annoying party/crap music scene(s) and some swearing/jokes that don't hit the mark. However, the majority of jokes - and pranks - are funny and do work.There's some feminism and pro-gay sentiment in there - and one great/terrible Jewish joke - but it's not sentimental or anything. Never going to blow minds or be a game-changer, but a decent way to spend 90min. And plenty of shirtless Efron or the ladies!"
" Great comedy, if you're not afraid to laugh
",2017-12-31 00:00:00,8,"I can't believe the amount of negative reviews here. 
It looks like the reviewers are far too bitter to recognize sarcasm. Obviously, nearly everything in the movie is a parody, giving you great opportunity to have a laugh at current society, rather than taking things seriously and getting offended like most of these reviewers probably do in real life. You're watching a freaking comedy.Only thing I can understand if you went to see this in a cinema. It surely isn't great cinema movie, because many of jokes are borderline and better to laugh at in safe enviroment rather than around alot of strangers. 
Thats one of the reasons that actually good comedies like this, that are pushing the boundaries of whats ok to laugh at in public don't belong to big cinemas in this day and age sadly. 
So if you saw this in the cinema and thought it's cringey, go watch it at home, alone or with someone you dont need to hide anything from, loosen your belt and have a fun.Thats how I watched it. With no expectations reading no reviews prior, and even though I'm not biggest comedy supporter, I had A LOT of fun."
" Ridiculous film
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,1,"This has to be the stupidest film ever made. No one acts like any of these characters, which would be fine if it is was funny. Now I realize this is Hollywood trying to brainwash viewers to their liberal, twisted mindset. But come on, if you are going to try that crap, make it funny. Personally, I hope anyone connected with this film does not work again for a couple of years."
" There is no ""I"" in sorority
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,7,"Basically they made the same film over, only with girls. Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) has a criminal record from the first film and a tough time getting a job. He mentors the sorority to get them started until they vote him off the island. At that point we swaps sides. Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) have their house in escrow and want to prevent loud parties for 30 days. Shelby (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) founded the sorority with the intent of throwing girl parties. I found their ""The Fault in Our Stars"" film festival where the girls cry all night was very funny as was the early poker game. The film had adult language and adult humor. And while there were several crude episodes, the film didn't entirely consist of crudeness, perhaps less crude then the first one, minus the window pelting scene.Guide: F-word, sex, no nudity. Girls in bikinis, Zac Efron stripping."
" Tries a little too hard for laugh
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,4,"Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising is the sequel to the hit Neighbors. It appeared obvious this film was greenlit as a sequel since the original was such a hit. This film does feel quite different but has some same elements. Overall, the entire plot about the girls sorority feels a little forced and played too hard for laughs. The problem is the female characters in the sorority weren't funny and the running joke was very forced and long running. After a while, we get used to it but it was too much and the entire ""feminism"" agenda was very obviously pushed. We are supposed to have sympathy towards them but nothing was there. There are some decent laughs but overall nothing completely original and funny. This sequel is somewhat disappointing and felt unneeded in the end. This was a major box office under performance compared to the original and it waved off any possibility for a sequel. Some decent moments but the entire film isn't as great."
" A fun way to pass an hour or so, v1.00
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,7,"Try to get recent features with Selena Gomez, one finds just a short appearance. Except that with this and The Big Short the stories have a lot going for them. The Big Short is also good Selena. I found 'Aftershock' (2012) to be disappointing, seconds of bad girl Selena and the wrong sort of story, though I accept that Aftershock tried to portray something worth attempting to portray.At the centre of this story, B N 2, are the characters from Bad Neighbours, which I have not seen, plus Chloe Grace Moretz in one of her more fun roles. Her at 17 playing an 18, beginner level student, with Zac Efron, no longer 17 or 18, as her instructor in teen debauchery. He also passes on his skills re being a bad neighbour, while occasionally getting cuddles from neighbour Rose Byrne.I am hoping that it is okay to consider this story as unreal. The understandings of good practice would not have much survival value in the everyday world."
" get fresh air instead
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,1,I tried to watch it. Was totally grossed out and offended within minutes. I couldn't even watch the whole thing. It made my stomach hurt. There were no redeeming minutes so I decided not to waste time from my life watching it. Feel much better now. Do not recommend it at all.
" We Didn't Need a NEIGHBORS 2 but It's Got Some Laughs
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,7,"NEIGHBORS was a fun movie. It told it's story about a couple of new parents who are struggling to accept adulthood battling a legion of college frat members as led by a young man who was rapidly approaching his own moment where he'd have to learn to become an adult as his graduation looms. It's all about both sides inability to let go of carefree youth and accept their responsibilities, focusing their energies on an escalating prank war against each other instead. It made its point. It was funny. It ended. That should have been it. For some reason, it was followed by NEIGHBORS 2 (originally with the subtitle SORORITY RISING, but that seems to have since been dropped). We check back in on Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) Radner who are about to have their second child and they're preparing to sell the home they bought (and fought for) in NEIGHBORS to upgrade to a larger home. They've got an interested buyer and all they have to do is get through 30 days of escrow and the deal is done. Unfortunately for them, a group of outcasts from the local college have decided to rebel against college regulations that prevent sororities from throwing parties. These three girls, led by Shelby (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz), found their own sorority, Kappa Nu, in the house next door to the Radners and the battle starts all over again. It's round two of the battle of the young versus the not-quite-as-young (late 30's?).Comedy sequels are a tricky business because you don't want it to come across as a cash grab. It's real easy for a studio to see a comedy do better than expected and immediately dump money into a sequel that rehashes all the jokes and plot devices from the first film. I'm looking at you, HANGOVER II. The second NEIGHBORS movie actually tries to add something new to the series. I appreciated how one of the first things director Nicholas Stoller addressed in the film's commentary (yes, I listened) was the fact that comedy sequels are generally a bad idea because comedies are premise-based and it makes additional movies tough since you're sort of stuck adhering to the premise that was so popular. So he was aware he'd have to keep the age gap prank war gimmick but he found a way to mix it up, making the adversary a sorority. I'm not saying ""It's different because they're girls this time""; it's because the sorority is a bit more sympathetic. The battle isn't against cocky frat guys whose pride won't let them give the Radners peace. It's against a trio of girls who are a bit awkward and were having a rough go at college before they came together and were determined to buck the system and have the first sorority that can throw its own parties instead of forcing them to attend frat parties. They just want equal privileges, and they're not fighting for spite but for survival.Does it make a huge difference? Big enough, I guess. NEIGHBORS 2 still retreads a lot of the same ground as the first film. The motivations have changed but the execution is the same. The movie even brings back the Radners' former nemesis Teddy (Zac Efron), originally as an adviser to the sorority seeking revenge for his frat before jumping ship to team with the Radners against this new threat. I said it for NEIGHBORS and I'll say it again: Zac Efron is a funny dude. He's one of the best parts of these NEIGHBORS movies. Rogen and Byrne are great in their own right but, just as with the first movie a bit, some of their lines (improv?) seemed forced and disingenuous. Efron's delivery and performance is more natural; I genuinely buy him as a muscle-bound halfwit who only knows a life of partying and sincerely wishes his life held some sort of value. The girls in the sorority do a pretty good job but I found it harder to believe their dip into utter villainy by the end (in part because they were so sympathetic). When Shelby and her friends start chucking tampons at the Radners' house, it feels too extreme for them because I don't think the movie established them as insane as the fraternity from the first film. Regardless, it all works well enough that NEIGHBORS 2 will entertain anyone who liked the first movie. It's pretty harmless. We didn't need it. We got it anyway, it's way better than it could've been, but it's not quite funny/different enough to have warranted its existence in the first place."
" Abortive Takeoff...
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,5,"Pretty obvious idea for a sequel... It seems like it's going in an interesting and potentially amusingly fertile direction at first - looking at how the different sexes are treated in their quests to have fun... but soon, it drops that angle, and just has the girls behave in the exact same way as the guys...Don't get me wrong, I fully support women getting to do the same things as men (drinking, swearing, lots of sex, etc) with the same absence of judgement... but they need to have a different approach to it, otherwise there's no point in swapping the genders, at all.Something like ""Trainwreck"" succeeded where the likes of this and ""Bridesmaids"" stumbled, in my opinion - by managing to provide a uniquely feminine perspective on bad behaviour, and yet still being funny."
" The Good, the Bad, the Ugly: Neighbors 2
",2017-08-31 00:00:00,6,"Nobody asked for a sequel to Neighbors, but we got one. Was it better than the first? Not really. One thing that did stand out that they really don't get away from in sequels is that they didn't rehash all the same old jokes. So there is that. But there is more. Here we goÂSynopsis: Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) are ready to make the final move into adulthood. But just as they thought they have reclaimed the neighborhood, they learn that their new neighbors are even more out of control than the last. To evict them, they will need help from their ex neighbor (Zac Efron). Starring: Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne, Zac Efron, Chloe Grace Moretz Director: Nicholas StollerThe Ugly: Okay, the thing that killed it for me with this movie hit a little personnel. A few years back I had a soldier who tried to break up my marriage because I was booting him out of the military for good reasons. Now, while that scenario was happening in the movie I did not laugh once. Breaking up a loving marriage is not something to joke up.The Bad: Remember how I said they didn't rehash the same old jokes from the first movie. Well, that wasn't the case when it came to Seth Rogan. Now, I still do find him funny, but his humor is getting a bit old.The Good: Having a different antagonist in this movie was the right move. The young females who want to be independent but also rely on each other was nice touch. If the movie was a different type of movie I would let my young daughters watch this movie due to its moral. If you watch the movie really think about the end of it and you'll see what I am talking about.Final Thoughts: A decent enough movie that could have been on par with the original due to the changes made. I would have given the movie a higher rating, but that personnel situation gets in the way.Rating: 6 out of 10That's it for me folks."
" Awful
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,4,"It seemed to have sneaky conservative political propaganda, sometimes known as fake liberal political correctness or demo publican ism .I was very uncomfortable through out the film.I saw it on h.b.o .This was no National Lampoons animal house.The movie was making fun of the married couples expecting and wanting to sell their house for a new one, they wish listed earlier.It made fun of real estate.It also was really poking fun at sister sorry houses.When it came to the bro sorority house.They did not make fun of it enough.The straight character was satirized, but worst the gay member was not satirized at all.They were not funny.They were acting the same way Margaret Dumont acted in the Marx brothers.Adding a gay marriage threw off the story too.The real student usually wait till they graduate and have money in the bank, young single ones before they decide they want to get married.The only married college student is the one that started college too late. It all dawned on me about the message in this film.Singles are irresponsible and those who get married are not.It looked that way.07/25/17"
" Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne are the best
",2017-07-07 00:00:00,6,"Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly Radner (Rose Byrne) are slowly moving into adulthood. Another baby is coming and they've sold their house. They're in escrow for 30 days desperate for smooth sailing. Suddenly, a bunch of girls led by Shelby (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) move in next door to start a sorority with the help of Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron). Teddy is struck in his life and homeless. The girls are dismayed that only frats can throw parties. They hate the rapey frat parties, the intrusive RA, and hope to throw their own fun parties. Mac and Kelly fear their home sale will fall through.Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne have become the funniest part of this franchise. Their joint idiocy is hilarious. Most of the time, the wife is the responsible one but this franchise insists on making them both idiots. That's refreshingly funny. Moretz is a good foil. Her scene with her father is a good turn. Zac is back although the movie spends too much time on his situation. It doesn't need all that. This needs one or two big comedy sequence to get it over the top. There is one deleted sequence of Shelby fighting the Radners for their cell phones which is lots of fun. Comedy sequels can be difficult and this didn't suck. It's not great either."
" one of the most pointless sequels ever made
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,1,"dear god this movie was awful... seriously what on earth was the point of this movie being made? you want to know what the plot of this movie is? it's literally just an exact rehash of the first movie only this time the people living next door are a sorority house of girls rather than a frat house of boys and it's only used as feminist propaganda. that's the plot right there which is terrible. it made no sense, because the whole concept of the first movie which made it so good is that the frat house of boys keep partying hard and pulling pranks and that's why the neighbors go to war and they're trying to get rid of them. in this one, why are they trying to get rid of their neighbors? they didn't do any good pranks, they didn't throw all these awesome parties, they did nothing. there was not a single laugh throughout the whole entire movie, the comedic deliverance was just absolutely pathetic it was nothing but just a bunch of weed, d!ck and period jokes. all the slapstick was done with really poor fake looking cgi so it's impossible to laugh at since it just looks way too fake, and the whole movie was filled with really cringey, overly obvious, AND completely wrong feminist propaganda being shoved down your throat. for example the sorority girls claim that the college housing committee is sexist towards women because they get kicked out of the house more easily which is obviously not true, they call zac efron's character sexist because he called them gross for throwing their bloody tampons at a window, and in one scene a women says ""that's not sexist if it's against guys"". also there's a scene where two guys get married and kiss to support gay marrage. this movie was clearly only made for political correctness, and they achieved by just completely rehashing a funny movie and ruining it. awful, utterly pointless sequel."
" This movie gets WAY too much hate. Give it a chance; you may surprise yourself.
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,6,"Bad Neighbours 2 was directed by Nicholas Stoller and stars Seth Rogen, Zac Efron and Chloe Grace-Mortez. Soon after they have dealt with the frat next door, Mac(Seth Rogen) and Kelly(Rose Bryne) Radner must team up with a former foe(Zac Efron) to stop a new sorority that moved in next door. I very much so enjoyed 'Bad Neighbours' and thought it was a very funny film, mainly supported by its quality premise. When I was reading reviews for this movie, I thought it was getting pretty harshly beaten and after watching it, I don't know why. Sure it's not as good as the original but sequels rarely are and if you take this movie for what it is, I think you'll enjoy yourself. The actors have good comedic timing, there are some genuine stomach hurting jokes and the movie is just a solid, fun time. While the story is basically just a rehash of the original, if it ain't broke then don't fix it. That said, I think they've exhausted all possibilities with this concept and to continue this franchise would be to milk it so much that it begins to bleed. I will definitely say that the ending is very fitting and ends the arc of all the characters very well so I think continuing the franchise would completely disregard this ending.As far as acting and characters are concerned, this movie fairs pretty well. Everyone is reasonably funny and has some comedic timing but I wouldn't say anyone blew me away. Seth Rogen does what he does best(laugh) and Rose Bryne was just there. I like both the actors and they do pretty well here. Zac Efron expands his repertoire in this movie from dumb guy to dumb guy with no job, friends or life goals. He deals with this very dangerous and out of left field expansion moderately well and I think it may have furthered his career for the better(/end Sarcasm). Chloe Grace-Mortez was probably the best acting wise but wasn't the best COMEDY wise. She was fine and I'm not saying she wasn't a solid villain but her comedic acting wasn't the greatest. Ike Barinholtz was great as Jimmy and that clown... That clown man... I still have nightmares from that clown. One thing I will say is that the initial antagonism between Mac and Teddy is completely contrived and forced because they were on good terms at the end of the last movie.Technically, the movie is pretty flawed. The cinematography was pretty messy and I typically try to ignore it in comedies but it did kind of stand out in this movie, but not in the good way. The set and costume design was passable.As the genre would suggest, a comedies primary purpose is to make the audience laugh. As far I'm concerned, this movie achieved that goal. I laughed at a fair amount of the jokes in this movie and was thoroughly impressed at how good and clever the writing was at points. They reference the previous film at one point with a simple joke but this one joke made me nearly start crying with laughter. In conclusion, this movie has got good performances, good characters and a solid laugh/cringe ratio of jokes. I do recommend this movie.6/10"
" Generic, boring and pointless
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,1,"I have never imagined that the first review that I will write will be on a ""movie"" that I totally dislike. No plot whatsoever. If you consider that the first part of this disaster had plot, this one ruined it. Hopefully if you watched the first movie you will know who is who. This starts from nowhere and does not get anywhere. I am not a comedy watcher, but I've seen my fair share. This ""movie"" made me hate and laugh at all those ""feminist, SJW, snowflakes etc"" even more. The propaganda is really really strong in this one. Don't bother watching it. Trying to be something a comedy is not supposed to be. Generic humor, boring characters, points made on things that nobody takes seriously."
" Entertaining funny sequel
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,8,"I will say upfront that this sequel isn't quite as good as the original neighbors movie, but nevertheless I really enjoyed it! Seth Rogen, Zac Efron, Rose Byrne, and Dave Franco are all back and they all do a great job and are funny, once again i would have to say that I liked Rose Byrne's performance the best out of the whole cast, she really is hilarious and just like in the first Neighbors movie, she kills it as far as comedy goes. Lisa Kudrow is great again, she's only in this one for like 2 minutes but she's still funny. We have Chloe grace moretz and the other sorority sisters this time around, and I liked moretz here, she fits the role very well. The script is written well and it's freshly funny just like the original 2014 film. The movie also addresses some serious important topics like sexism and college life, and that's awesome because the fact that most of the frat parties you see are completely sexist and thrown for the purpose of attracting girls to have sex with is something that needs to be addressed. And this film does that well, while being very funny and entertaining. I really do suggest watching this and of course if you haven't seen the original neighbors movie then watch that one before watching this sequel. 8/10 for Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising."
" a total crap
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,2,I don't know if Seth Rogen had a case of this politically correct syndrome its contaminating everybody or if he had some mental diarrhea or even if the weed is starting to damage his brain cells. Either way I don't know what the hell he was thinking when coming up with such a lame script and cast of boring uninteresting chicks. Very disappointing considering the awesomeness of the first movie.
" Seth Rogen's Worst Film Yet
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,1,"I didn't have high expectations going into Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising; the first movie was no masterpiece, but it was a fairly typical Seth Rogen comedy - raunchy, fun, and full of weed. Unfortunately, Neighbors 2 fails to live up to even the mediocre expectations of Neighbors. What we get instead of a funny stoner comedy is some kind of dull, feminist soapbox where humor is replaced by spoiled college students acting like brats while trying to be portrayed as the 'good guys'.In the first Neighbors film, Seth and his wife are harassed by a fraternity moving in next door - they come up with various plans to get the frat kicked out, and eventually succeed, even getting Zac Efron's character arrested (in Neighbors 2 he notes that he now has a criminal record because of the couple's actions in the first movie). So, the first one is about a bunch of bratty frat boys who get a semi-well-deserved comeuppance in the end. Not a bad movie, but not anything to write home about either.In Neighbors 2, however, the movie starts off by introducing us to Shelby, the 'hero' of the film, as she lights up a joint in her first sorority meeting. The sorority says no because they're stuck up and not fun, so Shelby decides to start her own sorority where she and her friends from Gender Studies class can smoke all the weed they want or whatever. So she buys the old frat house off of Efron's character, and when her new neighbors the Radners come over to inform her that their house is in escrow and they'd appreciate it if the girls would keep the obnoxiousness down - Shelby, being an entitled millennial whose parents never said 'no', immediately pulls the gender card, and whines that sororities aren't allowed to party and so therefore asking them to not do that for 30 days is sexist. Henceforth the Radners are somehow the bad guys, even after the women throw dirty tampons at the Radners' house and their child gets into them. Then, to top it off, Shelby's fat friend decides it'd be a good idea to snitch on all of the pot dealers so they can have a monopoly on weed to make enough money to keep their house.Unfortunately, it seems that at this point we're STILL not allowed to see the sorority as the bad guys, even though they are quite literally ruining the lives of small time pot dealers. The Radners steal all of their weed though so that's nice, but then they respond by trying to break them up with espionage, and break into their house and sell all of their furniture. Oh boy, it's on now!Not quite. You see, in the original Neighbors, when the frat went too far, the Radners did something about it and they won. Now, when the sorority screws them over harder than the fraternity EVER did (by causing them to lose the buyer for their house, potentially giving their daughter STDs, and selling all of their furniture, etc), the Radners decide to try and screw them over back by spoiling their party. Unfortunately, when the party is ruined the girls all start crying about how they can never be friends again because they'll have to live in separate dorms, and because sexism wins again!Sadly, sexism did win in the end, and it was because for some reason the Radners forgot EVERYTHING these women did and felt sorry for them, just because they are girls and they don't have an official organization to host parties for them.. So they encourage them to continue the party, and these awful women get off Scot-free despite exposing a child to bio-hazards, robbing a house and selling the items, snitching on weed dealers and trying to break up a family. Efron's character got a criminal record for being an obnoxious party boy, but Shelby is portrayed as a strong, feminist hero who faces no consequences for her actions in the end - further reinforcing society's modern message to young women, 'consequences don't matter because consequences are sexist'."
" Possibly THE worst movie we've ever seen; plot = f***bombs.
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,1,"I can't believe we stuck it out. It was horrific. The plot was really bad: not just bad, beyond stupid - if you think you guessed the entire plot, you are right. The acting is terrible. Strangely, it really could be PG-13 easily - except for an amazing amount of language.Have someone sit down with you and say f*** over and over for 90 minutes. Did you laugh? If so, go ahead and watch it. If you started and are just watching to see how it ends - guess! You're correct - now turn it off and watch something else.Did anyone rate this higher than 1 star that watched it and wasn't paid or something? Gah - it's just so bad."
" Feminism Trumps Comedy
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,1,"Wow, this is as bad as it gets. With a film like this, our society has crossed a barrier, where insistence on PC is destroying comedy.Surely, the target audience for this sort of material is 14-year old's. This only makes it more offensive. Its brainwashing young, impressionable minds as to what it ""funny"".When I was that age, I loved comedy films, and its because comedy films used to push the envelope, sometimes bordering on subversive.There is nothing brave, clever or daring here, its strict adherence to third wave feminism masked as comedy.Does Seth Rogan even know what garbage he's making? Or has his brain turned to mush from all the weed. He gets props from the PC Hollywood establishment for being a good soldier, I suppose that's enough for him.But, please don't call this comedy."
" More Awesomeness
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,8,"I don't get the hate. This movie has literally double of everything that made the original great. I rewinded several times over a few funny jokes (""black cock!""). There are plenty of drawbacks and this would probably get a 9/10 if it was less similar to the original, but there was plenty of new ground tread here. Plus it had a pro-grrl spin, but not overly so for the dudes who are threatened by that. Rose Byrne's boobs were a sad omission from an otherwise fresh and hilarious sequel."
" A Reigned-In Seth Rogen & Addition Of Moretz Improve On Original Formula
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,"After watching the first ""Neighbors"" film, I was impressed enough by the acting and atmosphere to give a sequel a try. What I found was a pleasant surprise (as most comedy sequels are pure trash) in that the addition of a new character actually vaults ""Neighbors 2"" over the original.For a basic plot summary, ""Neighbors 2"" sees Mac (Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) now expecting a second child and selling their home to move on up. The only problem? They are in escrow, during which time a sorority, led by Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz), decides to move in next store, threatening their entire future. After a few feeble attempts to shut down the girl parties, Mac & Kelly are approached by ""old friend"" Teddy (Zac Efron), who plays both sides in order to find a purpose in life.There are two reasons why ""Neighbors 2"" eclipses its predecessor:1. When Seth Rogen isn't controlling a project, he is legitimately funny. Give him too much power and he turns everything into stoner or repulsive comedy (see: Sausage Party), but when he's actually directed and acting his schtick works well.2. Moretz is a great young actor, and perfect for this role. Her chemistry with Efron and the other actors is a breath of fresh air. She isn't just eye candy, yet she doesn't take the role too seriously, either. A good balance.In an era where comedies usually fall into the ""gross-out"" or ""rom-com"" categories, ""Neighbors 2"" nicely walks the fine line between edgy and smart. It has enough adult humor that you'll want to wait until the kiddies are in bed to push ""Play"", but it isn't raunchy just for the sake of raunchiness. Director Nicholas Stoller makes this a bit smarter of a movie than it probably has any right to be.Overall, I laughed quite a bit while watching ""Neighbors"" and didn't feel overly gross in the process...that's about all it takes for a comedy to appeal to me these days. Admittedly a pretty low bar, but this one did it for me."
" Should have just watched the first movie again.
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,3,"This is the film industry at its worst, lazy beyond believe, the first movie was OK, not the funniest film I have ever watched but OK. So we will make Bad Neighbours 2, ""what about the plot"" lets just substitute a fraternity house with a sorority house and then repeat the same jokes that were barely funny in the first movie again and again and again. The camera work at the start is appalling, the script and dialogue awful, I was trying to work out if it was my TV but the lines seemed to be delivered in a robotic style. The plot staggered from the absurd to ridiculous, a good sign I was bored was when I went to the kitchen and my wife asked if she should pause and I said no. Some reviewers have mentioned political agenda they give the film far to much credit."
" Some films don't need sequels
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,1,"I watched this film tonight with my husband, well half of it. We stopped watching it, it was shocking! I thought because the first one was good this one would be too, but I was wrong! I'm sorry but a child playing with a vibrator and dressing it up to me is not funny. Seth Rogen has the most annoying voices ever, he tries to be funny but he just can't pull it off. I think I have only seen one funny movie of his and that was 'Knocked up'. In my opinion the whole film is focused on marijuana and the jokes in the film weren't even funny, terrible film! Trust me don't waste your time by watching this film."
" Giggling teenagers, everything but funny
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,3,"When I watch a comedy I expect to have fun and to laugh a lot. With Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising I really tried to find it funny but besides one or two funny moments this movie isn't worth the name comedy. If you like to see teenage girls giggling during half of the movie, giggling about basically nothing, then you might like this movie. I don't, so for me this movie couldn't end fast enough. Add on that that I can not stand ChloÃ« Grace Moretz and certainly not in this role and you have the perfect ingredients to make my movie night a disaster. Plus the usual weed humor of Seth Rogen becomes annoying at one point. It's always the same with him, he's not really funny and has kind of an annoying voice. The acting of Rose Byrne was pretty bad as well if you ask me. The dialogues are good for sixteen year old and that's about it. How much I tried to like it I just couldn't. It's just not a good comedy."
" If you liked the first one.....
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,6,"Let's tell it like it is; if you don't like stupid goofy comedies, neither the first one or the sequel will be your thing. If you loved the first one as much as I did, you need to see this one! Mac and Kelly are buying a new home, trying to sell their current home, when....yeah, you guessed it! A sorority moves in next door. But of course. This was a given. Where else could the story have possibly gone? Even thou you would think the show would be a tad tuned down because its now a house full of girls next door instead of guys, you would be wrong.Casting gets an A+++ as they brought back all of the lovable crew from the first movie; a mistake so many film makers make by not bringing back the original cast that made the magic the first time.Just as many laughs as the first flick, just as much inappropriate, over the top - socially offensive behavior, along with the old friendly faces!"
" Twizard Rating: 54
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,5,"If you want to talk about consistency between the two Neighbors films, they do a great job. Unfortunately, the first film isn't good. And its sequel is perhaps slightly more enjoyable than its predecessor, but suffers from so many of the same fundamental issues (see Neighbors).I didn't need to revisit the first film in order to prep for this one. All I had to remember was how much I hated it.This one features the same unbelievable amount of plot holes, the same immature and derivative humor, yet lacks the somewhat ""relatable"" theme. However, I can probably say that I laughed a bit more this time around (twice is still more than once, right?).In Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, husband and wife duo, Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne, sell their house, which is now in escrow. So the new owners have 30 days to back out if anything seems fishy about the situation. It just so happens that a new sorority, headed by Chloe Grace Moretz, moves in next door. Apparently sororities in America have a strict ""no party rule,"" but THIS sorority vows to ignore that rule and throws one every night of the week.One of the things I hate about the first film is repeated once more here. The filmmakers want us to root for both sides, trying to make us empathize with both Rogen/Byrne AND the sorority sisters. But reality is, Moretz and her gang are really terrible people. What halfway-decent person would throw bloody tampons at a window with a 2-year-old on the other side watching? I'm literally not exaggerating.Then, in comes Zac Efron reprising his frat-guy role from the first film. But he's not just featured in the film--he becomes a third protagonist. We go into his whole story of being kicked out of his apartment after his roommate gets engaged. Now he feels all alone and is unsure of where his life is going.So the film is jumping around all three stories and winds up covering zero ground because of it. And Rogen, who's the only funny person out of the leads, is featured the least. Moretz and Efron are great and all, but they're not funny. This is a comedy.Pretty much the whole film consists of the married couple and the sorority going back and forth pranking each other. Rogen and Byrne report them to the university's administration, so to get back at them, the sorority steals all of their belongings and sells them (?). The filmmakers obviously assume that no one watching this is trying to solve any of these elementary conflicts themselves. Instead, they just keep piling on a series of unrealistic events where nobody is rational at all, and we're supposed to laugh about it.The movies boasts a couple of nice cameos, which go underutilized for the most part. And the comedy scenes have no real structure or pacing--the takes are all just thrown in there in a seemingly unorganized way.So if you loved the first film, you'll probably love this Neighbors 2.

" ""Neighbors 2"" overcomes recycled jokes with a clever, progressive slant
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,7,"The premise of ""Neighbors,"" a comedy about a couple with a baby getting into a prank war with a bunch of fraternity guys, seems unlikely to yield one good film, let alone two. Well, although ""Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising"" is made mostly of recycled materials, it's shockingly one of the better comedy sequels in recent memory, and by default that makes it one of the best comedy sequels.The first sign that ""Neighbors 2"" is not strictly a Hollywood cash grab is the return of the original director and writers. The script was a five-way collaboration between ""Neighbors"" writers Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O'Brien, producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg and producer/director Nicholas Stoller. They obviously all had a sequel idea they really liked, or they wouldn't have written it, produced it and directed it themselves.Despite appearances, ""Neighbors 2"" does more than swap the bros for ""hos."" Rather than replace the stereotypical frat boys of the last film (played by Dave Franco and Zac Efron, who return to this one) with hot sorority girls, the story focuses on a group of misfit girls led by Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz), who don't buy into the sorority system and want to create their own house with their own rules where they can party the way they want. Of course they get their bright idea when the Radners (Rogen and Rose Byrne) go into escrow on their house, and any funny business in the next 30 days could see the buyers walk, leaving the Radners with two mortgages. When the girls don't play nice, it's game on, again.For a film created by five dudes, the story has a surprisingly strong feminist angle, addressing double standards and poking fun at the idea of reverse sexism. Not where you were expecting this review to go? Me neither. Comedies written by and for women aren't even this good at breaking down female stereotypes and addressing the mistreatment of women (see 2008's ""The House Bunny""), let alone turning them into comedic fodder. As a man I can obviously only say so much on the subject, but ""Neighbors 2"" comes across as progressive and socially intelligent for all its immature humor. Movies with sorority sister characters typically portray them as hollow objectified shells with attractive body parts. These girls are only objectified in a couple scenes and it's to make a point about exploitation.If anything, the movie gives us the opposite of male gaze. The camera often ogles Zac Efron, whose character, Teddy, has lost his way and finds renewed purpose in intervening in the sorority v. ""old people"" wars. The script offers some spot-on commentary about the ways women objectify men, something it can really only pull off because it has Efron, one of the most actually ogled real-life male actors working today.The witty social issue undertones aside, ""Neighbors 2"" scores a fair amount of laughs, even though it cycles through scenarios from the last movie. As with the original, the divide between college Millennials and Generation X young adults plays a big factor in the jokes that work as do the inappropriate parent behavior jokes. Some of the gross-out gags, physical slapstick and drug humor, on the other hand, fall more flat.Through it all, somehow ""Neighbors 2"" touches on real themes in honest ways, whether it's sisterhood between the women, growing up and maintaining friendships for Efron and Franco's characters or embracing the role of parent. The depth is shocking for a movie requiring Efron to remove every shirt in his costume wardrobe.Dial it all back to the fundamentals and incredible kudos belong to these five guys for crafting a sequel that checks off all the boxes: It builds on the comedic conceit of the original, has a logical storyline, progresses the journey of its main characters and justifies its existence with something valuable to say. Argue all you want about whether it's funny or not, comedy sequels are often terrible and ""Neighbors 2"" actually works. ~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more!"

",2017-01-05 00:00:00,6,"A bit of sexist movie but this time against men. I did not like that. The real-life link: makes you reflect how people grow up and get their own life. What one used to be our bonds with friends fade and the only strong and important relationship remains your so and family. The storyline: very good. Difficult to predict, get the interest, evolved fast and has good action scenes. The final was however a bit disappointing since it was very similar to the first one and everything seemed to sort out from itself. Plausibility: not so great. As I said everything seemed to get to its place in the end which is not always the case. A happy ending, an implausible happy ending is not a good ending for a film of the 21st century. Character development: We see Zac's character facing dilemma and evolve. He becomes s locale character and you can relate to that. It has good jokes and it puts a lot of emphasis against sexism when it comes to females, however a step backwards for male sexism."
